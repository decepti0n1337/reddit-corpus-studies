What are you bringing to this discussion? "No matter how close they get" is what you are saying now. Before it was "Little to nothing to do with". Whatever man.

---
---
---
No. This is the game. We are not playing to make someone's stream better to view. Would people have reported someone for the funeral interruption that happened? Hell no. That was griefing too right? What about if someone corpse camps you? Or if someone keeps tagging mobs near you? I'm sorry but this is not how Classic is.
---
I bought a nightblade at level 39 and pvpd for a month instead of buying my mount when I hit level 40
---
There are a good few mechanical differences, especially back in the day, but yeah mostly it's a shift in player mentality mixed with knowing the game inside out already. 
---
Depends on your class
---
Except those guy were reported and botched about on the forums for weeks. You can absolutely report people for in game griefing I dont know why this is such a foreign concept to you. People rarely do it but it's a thing.
---
Man that's deep. Are you gonna play nice from now on?
---
I played Vanilla. Started Nov 24th, 2004, 2nd day of launch. Current account is dated June 2nd, 2005 (thats when i bough my own account in the summer). But feel free to continue talking out of your ass :)
---
Just until you die.
---
As I said in the video's comments, the shot looked too good to pass up and matched the theme overall. Amani vs Gurubashi trolls are different ofc, but the thumbnail is there to look cool, which the picture did IMO. 
---
hard to find cool-looking, high quality art that fits with the theme of my thumbnails. The Zuljin pic was awesome and fit the troll theme well, and although he's Amani, it worked too well to pass up. 
---
I dunno that it's deep but no. I am a fully developed adult now. I don't screech at people when I lose any more. When I do lose I now look to what I could have done better. Rather then looking around to see how everyone else could have done better. I am much nicer now. 
---
5 points in arcane concentration for ~10% reduced mana cost on all your spells, but 0/3 into Frost channeling? That's 5% per point instead of 2% per point. I guess you could get slightly more than 10% overall reduced mana cost from arcane concentration if you track the proc and used fireblast instead of frostbolt when you have it, but I'm pretty sure it's a terrible idea and still not on par with channeling. Plus threat reduction if you run dungeons is really useful.
---
Super süß❤️❤️❤️
---
God I love spaghetti...
---
exactly what blizzard wants to avoid 
---
I was about 15 and now I'm turning 30 this year.. damn..
---
The rogue one is insanely good for PVP.
---
I fucking knew my groups were filled with 11 year olds...  Explains a lot. 
---
Am I a filthy casual if I couldn't care less about spell batching?
---
In my previous video, I mentioned I would release this yesterday, so I was already late :)
---
Fun and emergent player based interactions?
---
Please, we want 2004 game design philosophy where real life jerks are allowed to be bad guys so the good guys have a chance to stand out,
---
not the sharded right click reported single player skinner box ARPG of retail WoW.
---
This, but mostly because feeding a family is expensive.
---
&gt; more gold than I'll ever be able to repay
---
It's certainly one of the most expensive things in vanilla, yes, but it's not completely un-farmable.
---
The ingots, fiery core and core leather are all farmed while doing MC, as are the Dark Iron bars, Blood of the Mountain, Essence of Fire...pretty much ALL of the mats for Sulfuron Hammer drop in MC, so that just leaves the 50 Arcanite bars, which is around 1,250 gold depending on the price per bar.
---
Yeah if a hunter with cheetah on follows your lowbie ass around and literally tags every single mob before you can? That’s griefing, and is reportable. According to Blizzard. That’s not really comparable to world PvP, which is an intentional part of the game.
---
[removed]
---
Burnt.
---
blacklisted=people know you are a bad egg on the server.
---
It sounds like a goof but you could definitely get away with a raid of like 20-25 overgeared fury warriors, leaving room for healers + class specific buffs and utility like decurse/tranq shot and stuff. People already tank as fury for the threat anyway so this could be a somewhat achievable meme
---
Why do you hate fun?
---
Haha my first raid was the same! Dwarf warrior, evade tanking mandokir's raptor. Exploit early, and exploit often, they say...
---
I was 14 when my mate invited me home after school to play that new game he had a beta access to. We played the same character one after the other while doing our homeworks. Fell in love with the game instantly and we played together until early Wrath. Still my best friend to this day, we often reminisce our old raid stories when we see each other!
---
&lt;3
---
I actually played both. The actual game-play is exactly the same and how I remember it. The massive difference is the knowledge that we have today, which makes it a hell of a lot more sophisticated compared to back then. 
---
My first character was a male nelf that I wanted to name Assassin. That was taken so i ended up being assasina or something dumb. I joined a guild and soon everyone was just calling me 'ass'.
---
FUN DETECTED FUN DETECTED FUN DETECTED
---
I did the AH/ trade chat scam  'WTB Emerald welp for 200g!' they see the one my alt put up for 100 g and buy it to try sell it to me, it only worked a few times before people caught on, never got banned for it.
---
&gt;blizzard  
---
&gt;you  
---
i know reading is hard sometimes but damn  
---
fun by whose standards?  
---
why go for stealth when one (me for example) is already invisible to everyone it seems? :) 
---
Not convinced it would be possible.
---
Blind. I would just walk around and rob people without hurting them lol I would be getting like 20 wallets a day easily
---
It's also impossible to spread properly without sharding.
---
Trying to help kill the dragons some dickheads dragged to town was one of the funnest gaming experiences I've every had!
---
WoW rally nailed that pen and paper feel - but with the visual feedback which, I personally felt like, prior RPGs didn't really capture the same way. 
---
I think it was how crude Vanilla was that made it feel so immersive. You really were just some dude who ventured out from the [insert starting zone here]. Never thought of it as more "sophisticated" but you are totally right. Although, with sophistication comes both good and bad things.
---
Out of curiousity, do you prefer the more sophisticated version or do you miss the olden days? I think they excel in different ways. 
---
Okay! You're fun. Please don't hurt me.
---
I am of the opinion that it's always harder to create than berate something. The video itself was great! I want to clarify that. But that one little thing  just itched me in a way that I couldn't scratch.  Best of luck with your next project!
---
In other news, water is still wet. 
---
I fully agree with all of those points. They failed especially on the PvP part.
---
But they *tried* to emphasize open pvp, don't forget that. I can't remember what it was called but there were open PvP hotspots that activated from time to time.
---
The problem with those were that the reward/time just wasn't there to compete with BGs and especially Arena. I think Arena was the biggest mistake they did still. I love PvP but not that! That is a heavily streamlined, pseudo competitive instanced mode that has nothing to do with MMORPG.
---
WoW made one major mistake when it came to PvP in general. They never really understood how to integrate it into the *world*, but instead tried to control PvP action and push it into instances, which completely sucked the life out of the conflict to be had between the factions.
---
I never played a hunter but I seem to remember you get your arrows from BRS. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Doomshot 
---
Am I wrong?
---
You sure about that?
---
Playing an alt here and there to lvl 30 isn’t playing vanilla in the context that he means, tips. It is kind of annoying that you keep trying to capitalize on something that you weren’t a part of at all. 
---
Most classes it is optimal to put all the points in one spec until the 31 point talent. Priest is a rare exception.
---
*Wooo* It's your **7th Cakeday** kentalish! ^(hug)
---
But you never played ZG in vanilla 
---
show armory, should have some good achievements on it
---
For some reason I thought heroic dungeons were fine, I even thought 10/25m raids in the beginning of wrath was fine because they were aimed at different audiences and there was no reason for a 25m guild to ever do 10m content.
---
Multiple difficulties became a problem in totc with the introduction of heroic raids and it became part of the progression. Progressing through the same raid multiple times fucking sucks, I don't want to start off every tier by blazing through the new content at a trivial difficulty for upgrades. Totc was the day wow died for me, I just didn't know it at the time. 
---
you couldn't try to be more cringe with your reddit-tier "humor" if you tried  
---
That's a really elitist mindset dude. Don't be like that.
---
So you want people to have to pay twice to play both games just because you *apparently* selfishly want something you dislike but others don't to die?
---
This is exactly the point of my main post. People like you.
---
Latter isn't going to be an issue for me. I'm not playing on a PVP server. Can't stand PVP.
---
NO WAY MAN GET TO 60 IN 2 WEEKS IRL OR BE A NUB FOREVER!!!
---
/s
---
But really I agree, people(even myself at times) seem to be too focus on rushing 60. While getting to 60 is definitely a goal we all should shoot for. Since a huge part of the server wont be 60 for on average 2-6 months I see no reason to rush too much. I know when I level up, Ill be following a guide, but I plan on taking breaks and doing each dungeon a few times for fun and gear. I especially think at 50+ Doing Mara/ST/BRD is important to get a few pieces of higher level gear earlier than if I had waited until 60 to started doing dungeons
---
My primary concern in classic is pvp (probably solo wpvp since I'm a loser) and hopefully bgs later on
---
What CAN'T mages do? 
---
Maintaining? There's nothing to maintain. You level to 60 and either raid end game or pvp. The raiding route could be a problem if your guild only raids one 40 man a week. 
---
That's how Jeff Kaplan pronounces it....so I think that's the correct pronunciation.
---
I disagree. Downvoted.
---
This isn’t news.
---
31-35 I've read about nostalrius shotdown 2015 got very confuzed why so many people  played such an old gameand why they are so upset. So I talked about it to my irl friend and he was like "dude vanilla wow was the the shit, lets play it. By this time i was pretty much done with so called MMORPgs,but I jokingly agreed i thought ill just dick around for a week for the lulz and move on. But after I played it for a bit something magical happened. That this is it, the holy grail, the sweet prince, it was here all along! The that is what it says on the tin ** an actual MMO** not some shitty single player game with lobby coop crudely nailed to its skull, that pretends to be an MMO, and oh boy for that i can forgive a lot to a game(not everything, otherwise I would've played eve, but a lot)
---
Nah! Alliance have to do the 10 frostmaul shard quest before they can do the quest for the cache.
---
My little brother bought me the game for my twenty-first birthday in 2005.
---
Yeah I was there! Was a drooood
---
I (might) be dual boxing a paladin and mage for leveling purposes.
---
Paladin is nothing fancy: [This @ 40](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZZVbxtdcqo) then 40-50 might get points in holy for str / int. 50-60 don't matter, dump in trash. TL;DR: hit things hard with a hammer. Put points in things that make that hurt more.
---
Mage will be deep fire casting arcane missiles. It'll be [this until 39](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgGz0cux) - and then essentially no change from 40-60, no skills add any real benefit, maybe 5 points in arcane for hit rating. Mage is there for stun chance from fire blast crits (for extra damage from seal of command on paladin) and then 3/4/5 seconds of idle DPS from missiles.
---
At 60 the paladin is [this for raids](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxhMgstVMtc0h)
---
Mage will sit in Ironforge and post auctions.
---
who the fuck cares
---
I'll enjoy my lifetime buff of "Find Treasure" and become a billionaire by plundering sunken Spanish gold.
---
Zuljin does
---
Questing optimization and instanced pvp both started in vanilla not TBC, you got hubs added and buffed and battlegrounds were the first strike to world pvp tbf and the moment cross realm battlegrounds dropped that was it for my servers, world pvp got wrecked fast
---
I agree with the sentiment though, a lot of shitty decisions started back then (vanilla included)
---
After listening: he sounds like a genuinely nice and kind guy. That's exactly what you need from a person who's job it is to liaise with an often-angry, loud community of gamers. And I think he has done a fantastic job in that sense. 
---
 Corporate America has gone insane. Whatever business logic that has led to a situation in which this guy gets canned, but Robert Kotick gets $38,300,000 a year, is completely absurd. 
---
I found paranoia+perception to be a godsend against stealth classes, great for guarding the flag room in wsg
---
Revive pet
---
On “progression” private servers, they start it out as green as you mention. Then it turns to its blue, upgraded stats at the release of AQ (which was patch 1.9). Yeah it’s a little odd how private servers do this but there are other pieces of gear that are also upgraded at AQ release
---
I loved that turtle. That fight to get him is funny as hell too. Easily my favorite fight to do drunk
---
Chat channels aren’t sharded and when you group you shard together. In retail there are still reasons that you can be grouped and not see people, in your group. None of those reasons exist in classic.
---
Phantomb - Druid
---
Bathrobe - Mage
---
When leveling a warrior I highly recommend Herb/Alchy.  Having lots of Health Pots on hand is a life saver.
---
A brand new incarnation of my first main, a night elf druid. It's the most fun class in classic IMHO, I will run a lot of AVs, tank 5mans, and heal a few raids maybe.
---
I didn’t remember this but after comparing Venomstrike and Lil Timmys, yeah it seems like it
---
Rezz
---
Nahh you’re a human. He was a NE. 
---
As with all 2h weapons, it's for pvp.  At the time nothing was better for hunter pvp except Ashkandi. 
---
Wasn’t a NE. Nerevarine was. C was a human warrior blonde hair with a ponytail
---
And realize that you don't have enough mana. 
---
I mean if there is no melee who wants it sure.
---
Same LOL because of this I became a much better at typing and spelling
---
And you would be wrong
---
Have fun gearing up / distributing the loot ;-)
---
I found this true but there were a lot of kids that gave the whole a bad name. I didn't want my guild finding out how young I was in fear of being booted 
---
Great instance.  But the gear choices were terrible - as in broken.  You don't put blues that are on par with AQ40 and Naxx gear.  What the heck was Blizzard thinking.
---
The vanilla gatekeeping on this sub is laughable
---
This is a Mage thread...
---
31 - Wife to be was living in Philadelphia.  I was in New York.  I had a ton of free time to play - until she moved in.
---
Party.  Play WoW.  Work.  Party.  Play WoW.  Work.
---
Like 11 or 12 back in Vanilla
---
How interested are you in having a discussion where your views might change?
---
Ok, thanks. I'll probably do Tailor / Enchant then
---
I heard that was just an out of season April fools joke
---
I mean, if he worked on cardio + the 30% he would probably be Olympic level fast pretty quickly.
---
You're not a filthy casual, but seeing as you don't care about spell batching, you're also probably not competitive enough in PvP to notice it.
---
As someone who really genuinely (not toxicly) cares about pvp and duelling, not implementing something that emulates spell-batching will ruin the feel of the game.
---
 Spell batching is under the hood stuff that genuinely creates a disparity between what classic was, and what it probably will be. The difference in skill between good pvpers and the best pvpers were how they utilised the effects of spell batching. For example, Cheap shotted a mage? You know he's about to blink dat, so pre-emptively gouge him so he is gouged at the blink location, giving you the edge in the duel.
---
I get both it. It's not something the majority of players care about, but to me, I'll be quite sad if I can't occasionally pull off mind-reading moves like that. Honestly, the feeling you get when you do it is amazing, and it's something that a lot of players loved about the game until it was removed.
---
It probably won't make it into classic, and that won't stop me from playing, but it would ruin pvp for me personally. 
---
For the absolute BiS bear set, why not go for 3pc t2.5? Obviously the chances of you getting it in reality are very slim, but with zero +def on leather gear in vanilla, the +15def and 150 armor set bonus is amazing. I'd probably go genesis shoulders/chest/legs because there are better bear-geared alternatives for helm and boot slots.
---
August 2007
---
I was 11
---
Still flex my Zg tiger mount all the time. 
---
Was going to be a NE druid. Planned my leveling and gearing progression to 30 on a private server. Was very excited to FC in Warsong. Was going to tear up world PvP. Was going to farm DME for gold.
---
Found out some old friends from Cataclysm till WoD are rolling Horde. I don't want to be a Tauren damnit. Orc Warrior I guess.
---
Overcome a crippling drinking problem.
---
One wallet. You can only cast it once.
---
And do you really need a WoW ability to blind people?
---
I've seen some of your content, you talk more out your ass than anybody in the scene lmao
---
I remember a lot of the kids in my school would play it and we would talk about it as much as possible, eventually joining up on the same server... fun times 
---
.0000159% of the earth's population would die.

That's WoW's peak sub numbers (12 mil) divided by the world's pop (7.53 bil).
---
I thought most people were my age or older when I started playing at 23. I had no idea everyone was so young. 
---
Do I have to stand there and stare at it for 10 seconds? 
---
38. last year of BC. you can just call me granny

Worst case scenario it would end up looking like a Monty Python skit. 
---
“Run away!!!”
---
Depending on the exact math used to determine bis the prices may change. I used the bis from a list that has resto, bear and cat on one huge Google sheet I pulled the top of those lists for the bis forever. I'm in no way an expert on picking gear. I'd have to double check the pieces you mention to see how they compare.
---
I can say off the top of my head that 15 defense isn't going to do much. 440 is crit immune, which a bear can never obtain. And the armor bonus from sets bonuses does not stack with bear form, so it's a lot less useful than normal armor on pieces. 
---
Oh they knew
---
Mage have higher parses then warlocks across the board. Mage have the highest QoL in vanilla between summoning food, portals and AoE farming.
---
Warlock has more consistent damage in Naxx gear. Comfy leveling experience. Very high survivability in PvP. Also, you will be more desirable in raids, as there will always be less locks then mages.
---
i imagine most of the deaths would be from pre raid bis farming
---
yup i was an 8 year old who still exceeded at pvp because 80% of people played like an 8 yo or worse lol
---
I was 12 when I started playing in 2005, and I'm firmly in the no changes mindset even after trying private servers.
---
Has little to do with not being able to see strengths and weaknesses at that age, or having rose tinted goggles. 
---
In my eyes vanilla is just a much better game. It gets me addicted like no other game can, included retail. 
---
No one would play it
---
Technically it's an ability 
---
Ritual of Doom of course. Or Inferno. 
---
There's a boss in naxx that requires priests mind control impossible whit out it can't remember name now
---
How are mages against hunters 1v1? 
---
Except Demon Armor only lasts 30 minutes and you can only cast it once. 
---
dual boxing ew kys promptly
---
You're basically just throwing sand in people's eyes dude. You could already do that whenever you wanted 
---
Solid as fuck.
---
My only suggestion is Improved Ret Aura rather than Sanctity Aura. A bunch of maths were done by theorycrafters and the result is that Imp. Ret Aura does more DPS overall until you start getting insane stat scaling from top-tier raid gear.
---
It'll also do more DPS when your Mage gets wailed on (which will be always since he'll be pulling aggro every time.)
---
I mean depending on how it works. If you have to face a grizzly for 10 seconds, that immediately gets aggressive on cast... you will probably be wishing you chose Divine Shield instead.
---
Scholomance and Stratholme were 10 man for a while too!
---
I started vanilla at age 30, clear old man territory according to this poll.  I never liked a MMORPG enough to seriously play prior to or since vanilla, including expansions.
---
Vanilla had the perfect combination of a somewhat chaotic gameplay design that didn't feel over-engineered and an intricate expansive well thought-out world design.  Previous games lacked the world design and subsequent games lacked the wild west gameplay.
---
Stats say a large portion would be from Defias pillager.
---
I loved Legion so much. ;_; You just made me remember how much I miss my time playing it.
---
Pffh I'd just stay in org naked dancing on the mailbox for tips. 
---
Ah! the worse kind. Well hopefully you have changed. if not..well I hope to not be in the same group.
---
Yup pretty toxic but I like to think I’ve matured to a trustworthy groupmate 
---
I'd be way to scared to try this and fuck myself on gold
---
You can group up for those.  Where as dungeon runs are risky and a single accidental extra pull can lead to a wipe.
---
I think retribution aura would be cooler. 
---
&gt;2)- Way less centralized spying concerns.  Ventrilo doesn't scan your drive for installed 
---
Does the web app do this?
---
You're right, meta has changed.  But when classic launches the existing "Meta" will be transferred.  Many new players that don't see this sub will be there as well but they will learn the new meta- general discussion about the game today is very different than 14 years ago. 
---
&gt; Has little to do with not being able to see strengths and weaknesses at that age, or having rose tinted goggles.
---
&gt; 
---
You say that, but yet...
---
&gt; In my eyes vanilla is just a much better game.
---
Better than what? Better than vanilla with improvements? If so, how could you possibly know?
---
There's an increasing amount of pressure on all these content creators to produce meaningful (not rehashed) content since there's a lot of people out there like us that will give our clicks/likes to anything that is reasonably done.  As such I think that all the content creators are 'feeling the heat' a bit and you kind of put pressure on yourself to try and stay relevant and on your A-game . 
---
Once classic releases a lot of these theory-craft or explanation videos will probably give way to actual gameplay which will be nice =P  
---
He knows as much as we know. He just quoted the Bluepost that confirms its still 2019.
---
&gt;that much armor
---
I mean... how much? If you're not wearing any gear in-game and use devotion aura you probably gain like... 25% physical damage reduction at most or something. Unless I'm missing a logical explanation for why 25% turns into invincibility.
---
Probably telling people to press Alt+F4. E.g. they would ask, "How do I go into Fullscreen mode?" and I would tell them, "Press Alt+F4." Needless to say that completely exits the game for them and they have to log back in.
---
That and I would sometimes ask in chat, "How do I quit my guild?" And people would type "/gquit." So by telling me what to type they would inadvertently quit their guild.
---
BFA is a bad batch of Krokodil.
---
The fact that your comment is downvoted speaks volumes, LOL.  I wish redditors did more up/down voting based on this rule instead of "I AGREE" it would really help avoid the circlejerk mentality. 
---
Yep I've literally never had an issue with discord that wasn't a setting or issue on my end 
---
No guild bank in vanilla.
---
Well in that case happy leveling/raiding! 
---
Don't tell the warriors
---
I don't at all agree with the guys that bombed that funeral BUT imo that is something that is really cool about WoW in a twisted way- it is what you make of it.  That guild decided to be total dickheads and edgelords and was rightly ridiculed for doing so *BUT* the fact that they were able to is important.  
---
Those two things are not hte same though.  doing /sit over and over so you 'teabag' is not interfering with their "RP event" or anything they were just having a duel tournament.  
---
The best way to deal with that is to laugh it off and ignore it.  Cmon guys we've all been playing online games for a long time- have we learned nothing about how to deal with internet trolls?
---
LOL! Of course there is a Guildbank in Vanilla, someone just makes a Mule and uses that as Guildbank.
---
And then they find you in the woods with a kitchen knife killing boars
---
Aspect of the beast- great name for a web browser or adblocker that is "do not track"!
---
Alpha could be next week... who knows?... can’t be too far away!!!... ugh... THE SUSPENSE!!!!! Just a matter of time brothers and sisters... and horde scum... 🙌
---
Right in the feels
---
In a (very) well organized raid, with going hard on consumes, with progression gear, barring tranq shot, I think the absolute hard stop would be Vael and Rag being impossible for them.
---
For Vael, its pretty simple, you get no damage boost and your DPS already sucks, even with loads of consumes you would die of attrition from BAs.
---
Rag with all mana using melee I think might be impossible. They would be getting hit by knockback every few seconds and would have no where to spread out. It would be nearly impossible to get any appreciable amount of damage in.
---
While Magmadar is doable without Tranqs in bad gear with chain shield walling, I dont see it being even remotely possible without an extremely well geared Paladin, like probably needing Naxx gear to handle enrage, even with consumes
---
Everything else in MC might be very hard but manageable, double mana on Luci, 75% less healing on Ghennas, add control on Garr, running in and out on Geddon, Sulf adds with no interrupts, Golemagg stacks on melee. Im not saying these would be easy, but I think in a very well organized raid with good people, it would be doable
---
Shazz AoE on melee would be extremely difficult to manage especially with no decurse. Arcane Prot pots would likely be a must at the very least. 
---
Domo with no CC or interrupts, would be madness, but again, manageable with enough tanks and seperation.
---
Razorgore is also probably impossible, not enough damage to manage the adds and no real way to kite, I doubt a group of 40 paladins in MC gear could manage to hold on until the eggs are destroyed.
---
I think Onyxia would be easily doable, but would take a long time due to Phase 2 having almost no DPS.
---
Female Nightelf balance druid with blue or white hair.
---
Female Nelf has the best casting animations out of all the druid variations. 
---
Make camp fire? Have a snuggly =)
---
Hrm, I never tried any of those games. I had a brief stint as a GM in Tera but the game was too imbalanced for me. I have FFXV on my console but haven't played it yet, don't have FFXIV at all.
---
I've been playing GGS like HOI4 and CK2 as well as RPGs ever since. I'm plat in League but I don't consider it my primary game. Friends also recommended ESO to me but I guess I'm just too wary due to the initial backlash when it first launched. 
---
Welp, one of the good things of having leveled on private servers is that I've done the optimization thing enough for one lifetime. 
---
Also, Classic is going to have so many players at all brackets that I won't have trouble doing dungeons like on pservers (looking at you RFK and Gnomer, ugh) which means more time to do time-wastey stuff!
---
So I'm going to 100% level with RP professions, lol. Actually right now on a pserver I'm leveling my new Human Paladin with Mining + Blacksmithing so that I can upgrade all my gear as I level without having to wait for dungeon drops (like I said, that 25-35 range is hell without RFK + Gnomer runs) so it's been actually useful somewhat haha.
---
I'm still not sure on some of them, but for sure the most obvious one is a Gnome Mage with Engineering. Tauren Druid with Herbalism is another obvious choice. Troll with Beast-slaying with Skinning + Leatherworking works too.
---
Anyway, I know this isn't what you're looking for so I'll stop, heh.
---
I believe it cannot because a browser simply can't be told to do that.  My answer is not definitive, however.
---
Better pick the heartstone then, and lock yourself in the bathroom.

The real world is slightly better written than Azeroth, and Azeroth has air conditioning and black dragons.  I dunno.
---
Devotion Aura rank 70 is 735 armor.  Versus level 1 people in the real world, that's 60.24% damage reduction.  It's definitely not invincibility, but it's not a particularly bad call.
---
well i would play rogue or paladin
---
paladin is a big winner if you get to level 52 or whenever it is you get your 12 second divine shield so you can bubblehearth away from anything
---
So when are you giving back the money you took from your fake-arse "leak" stream?
---
50 is the new 40 :)
---
How can your guildies not be arsed to do it, yet you have to?
---
WoW characters run places all the time, unless they toggle it on.  He's correct, while you can't run in stealth, it is faster than walking.  Unless you attacked somebody, talked to someone, or took damage, you'd just be invisible forever, and move faster than walking.  
---
I feel that's the life of some kind of psycho wraith though, and once you get used to being the invisible mountain hermit, you stub your toe and now you are just a crazy unshaven loonie.
---
how will my playing pve leveling content on a pve server have an impact on others.
---
Kill myself? Go fuck yourself.
---
If a boss fight only lasts 20s then maximising your DPS on that fight is pure epeen stroking. You might as well see how big a pyroblast crit you can get on a squirrel.
---
Devotion aura is 60% damage reduction versus a level 1 guy, retribution aura is 20 damage, which is either a 1 hit kill, or at most 2 hits.  Since both only help you if you are in a fight, I'd say that retribution aura is by far the most helpful, but if you ever get into a brawl there's gonna be a bunch of bodies and you wouldn't get much say about it.
---
Imagine how furious you'd be being locked up by a demonic judge for telling the truth.
---
Glad to hear. What are your thoughts on Human vs Gnome as a caster? Will I be losing out if I don't play Gnome because of the 5% int and Escape Artist?
---
I have my own math going on.  Ret wins for 2+ add, sanctity for single. Since I plan on single pulls, it wins.
---
The mage won't (shouldn't) be pulling aggro either, (6.5 seconds of damage every 8 seconds - fire blast, channeled arcane missiles, repeat once paladin's judge is up) - my math has the mage doing 90-120% of the paladin's damage.
---
Pally opening with Judge (plus sanctity aura, plus 60% threat from righteous fury) vs a fireblast? Should be fine.
---
I remember it was like my 1st week of high school, and I hopped in vent and was going crazy about all the German I learnt that day.
---
I'll never forget shutting down my laptop, so I said I had to go, and clicked shutdown. The couple guys I was talking to thought I'd left, and complimented me loads, which I heard while my PC was shutting down - which meant the world to me as a autistic 11 year old with no friends lol.
---
Talking and typing to people on Vent/WoW every day, in all my spare time, completely changed me from a stuttering mess with no social skills, to who I am today.
---
I still talk to my raid lead/officer from ICC today, we play things together from time to time and keep up to date on eachother's lives. WoW really did change my life.
---
Nvm that. Scorpid venom in shimmering flats will test your humanity.
---
Probably , Rank 1 Blizzard was a pretty effective way to find stealthers.
---
I leveled with enchanting back in real vanilla.  It slowed me down for real.  Tons of crap materials, constantly creating stupid sticks that took up bag space forever, repeatedly throwing worthless enchants using up gear that would have vendored or sometimes even AHed.  
---
The bonuses it gave were absolutely crap as well.  Tiny bonuses all around to disposable gear.  
---
Now, once I was max level, and had suffered through that, enchanting was great.  I could help my friends out, and sell enchants profitably in chat.  Enchanting was useful and fun at max level.  But the grind of low level enchanting will *in no way* help you level faster.  
---
Your other points are all fine.  Engineering is also reasonably grindy, but you definitely gain benefits from it.  Armor professions can keep you out of really bad armor, and alchemy is legit just gear while you are leveling.  Gathering professions, well, you are mailing those things to a bank alt and selling them usually, so that part is fine.  Everyone knows those are good though.
---
Bruh, I raided with my irl friend from school in ICC. His parents were very demanding, always asking him to do things, one time he asked his little brother (we were only 12 or something ourselves, so he was probably 8-10?) to tank for him so he didn't have to admit he needed to go for 15 minutes or something. All fell apart when he was being asked questions on vent, and his brother wasn't responding while jumping around on the bear.
---
Starting playing in Vanilla beta in July 2004, at 15 and a half. Now 30 \^kill \^me
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
I appreciate the reply, but I'm more looking for very specialized info about top end gear pvp. I understand the generalized stuff. I just haven't ever used a mage or rogue in aq+ gear but I have with lock. 
---
WoW armour is a bit weird though. In real life if I had a magical aura equivalent to all-over coverage with sheets of metal you wouldn't be able to hurt me by punching me at all and you'd break your hand. In WoW it's just an n% reduction in the damage caused by each punch.
---
Depends on whether you present valid points and are respectful.
---
Well for pvp escape artist is way better than perception, and the 5% int isn't anything to sneeze at. For raiding the 5% helps but your but not gonna lose a raid spot over it.
---
I'm not trying to say anything about them being good or bad.  Engineering is high cost high reward.
---
You should have listed the gloves them for 1450g.
---
I used it primarily for pvp in vanilla retail. ZinRok + +20% raptor crit is a great combo, I could get 1.5k raptor crits. 
---
Guilds with MC on farm and bwl in progression. Even UTB is significantly better for melee dps (for horde 2h fury). Besides, even for warriors, its off-spec pvp gear. Same for hunters. 
---
Trash pulls is where raptor really shines. 
---
Divine Intervention.
---
Level the class you want to main first. Want to heal in raids? Might as well be one of the first 60 healers. You'll get invites to instances and raids. You can practice healing as you level and build relationships with your server community so you know players who need a healer. Level your farming alt second. 
---
Huh, I wasn't aware of set bonuses not multiplying in bearform, that probably puts it behind other pieces with higher base armor. Still, it seems like any +def you can get helps reduce the frequency of damage spikes.
---
this is capitulation to the shareholders above all else. Acti/Blizz management are the problem because they put short-term profits over hard working employees. People need to stand up. This isn't right. These owners are breaking the social contract.
---
&gt; I don’t enjoy alts in retail because of systems such as azerite as it feels you have to stick to one character or fall behind 
---
Vanilla is much more like this to be honest. If you are gearing/levelling alts when you could be farming gold, honor, rep etc on your main then you will feel like you are falling behind. 
---
The guy makes a video about how good ZG was despite never playing it. That is indeed laughable.
---
Cure Disease
---
Stealth
---
Welcome to vanilla!
---
You might be better off just doing herb/tailoring and selling the herbs if you’re just planning on dropping Alchemy. This way you could make some side gold making bags for tips. On a new realm you get free profession levels + tips if you can make bags. 
---
I mean, why change what I was already gonna do for classic?
---
Good luck finding your homies.

Didn’t only one person have to beat it to save everyone? I’d grind my way to org and chill there. I’d be able to go between .Org and UC but I guess no TB for me haha.
---
Stormreaver / Carluce here
---
arcane shot
---
yes
---
Engi is best prof for hunters. Besides the obvious, hunters can feign and use cables as wipe recovery. 
---
if i use orb of deception, what will my enemy faction be?
---
There isn’t any indefinite system like azertie in Vanilla. Things take a lot of time but you don’t fall behind because you fail to farm an infinite grind. I think Vanilla is very alt friendly if you want to put a lot of time in.
---
Just a different approach to vanilla. I'm all for going hardcore when the outcome is in doubt, I just don't see the point in spending hours getting buffs and consumables so you can smash content you totally outgear and outskill very slightly harder.
---
I'd honestly recommend leveling engi as you level unless the character you're playing is never going to be engi. It's actually quite cheap to level, good items and OP consumables for any class while leveling. I've leveled a mage, hunter, and shaman on pservers taking engi from level 5. Worked great for each class. 
---
For the Alliance!
---
Shaman, Warrior
---
(My group has several shamans and warriors)
---
Spirit tap, yes, wand spec isn't worth delaying shadowform. 
---
Its kinda useful. But then again, unless you outgear the rogue they will just kill you as a warlock without teammates. And felhunters dont do crap against rogues either.
---
Honestly I understand the urge to white knight for this guy cause he’s a content creator that brings attention and hype to classic. Does he though? Effectively? Does anybody outside the insular classic community know who the fuck TipsOut is? Doubtful. I think Staysafe has a wider appeal.
---
I personally find it disingenuous that this guy popped out of seemingly nowhere and became a huge voice for the community. Or *a* voice. And it seems pretty shitty that he gets that privilege when he hasn’t even experienced the raids or any meaningful endgame at the time.
---
I personally don’t care but I understand why people are not engaged. 
---
It was the non necessary raid of the week that was always my favorite.  Got to gear up a ton of alts to be ready for MC/BWL.  
---
The point you're missing is that imp gouge is 4.5sec. Dropping combat is 5sec. So you have to burn half a second to actually be able to stealth, that's where folks spamming instant casts comes in.
---
Dam, I don't remember your exact character name, but the guild After Midnite does sound familiar!
---
&gt; Ret wins for 2+ add, sanctity for single.
---
With Improved Ret you have to take into account that it's on every enemy melee swing, whereas Sanctity only buffs your Holy dmg, which you won't have Consecrate for, and SoC swings so slowly (hard, but slow) and will oftentimes miss altogether because you won't have the extra Hit from Precision. This is why we call it Seal of Casino after all.
---
&gt; Pally opening with Judge (plus sanctity aura, plus 60% threat from righteous fury) vs a fireblast? Should be fine.
---
I leveled duo with a Mage. They still pulled aggro off me (that's how insane Mage leveling DPS is) until I got Imp. Righteous Fury and the Mage throttled their DPS.
---
This is also why Paladin tanks are trash most of the time btw :D
---
Hey, if they can't do it, they'll have fun trying.
---
My parents have played it since late 2005 ( i think, it was like a year after classic launched), and I only actually started PLAYING the game in WotLK
---
&gt;These owners are breaking the social contract.
---
And if they didnt they would be breaking the law. You have a fiduciary obligation to your shareholders, and keeping redundant positions on the payroll is not responsible. I've seen very, very few people mention that while the cut 8% of the work force, they're increasing development teams by 20%. 
---
As a player and a shareholder, I see more devs and less GMs as a positive for the health of the game and to grow the stock. 
---
revive pet
---
I guess it depends if diminishing returns, spell duration and recast time.

I don't know how fast Jessica Biel can undress but .... wait, what were you thinking about doing with the spell?  
---
Funny how you're actually answering the thread topic how you should but get down voted for it. Lol
---
Haha man I love sarcasm it gets me every time! 
---
It's hard to quantify which decisions were particularly harming to the experience we like from classic, but I never did feel these problems at the time of TBC.
---
I can only imagine that these allowed the devs an easier time at pumping out content so that is the formula they stuck with in future expansions, which has led to formulaic stagnation.
---
Wrath is without a doubt the point where blizz doubled down on your above points at the sacrifice of the world.  Things could have gone differently at that point.
---
The difference is tbc was a work of innovation at the time, and wrath was repetitive execution of design.  I too liked tbc and disliked wrath so I'm biased, but it is true that I feel most of the situations the game is in now can be attributed to deciding to stick with streamlining systems over expanding on systems that make the world feel alive.  Which definitely started with wrath, and has only continued from then.
---
That's incorrect. 
---
Gouge with imp gouge talent is 5.5 seconds.
---
If only I had any friends PepeHands
---
I played vanilla and did ZG a million times, but I don't remember being able to mount in the raid, as mentioned in the video.. could you really?  
---
if so my memory must suck.
---
You're 100% correct
---
I find the players on private servers are vastly superior to live and even vanilla wow players.
---
As a tank, they will take initiative and CC without me asking and do it rather intelligently. Everyone knows why i stopped pulling because im watching the healers mana (no not the DPSs mana) and don't complain why I stopped
---
Ythisens sounds like a great guy, and I hope opportunity strikes in the future.  It's hard to hear stories like this from people who are as passionate about their job.  Just because I would take one of him over a good third of my current coworkers.
---
&gt; The only reason Actiblizzion isn't giving people the choice to only pay for Classic is because they are a bunch of anti-consumer fuckwits who care about nothing but the bottom line.
---
And watching a chunck of the population leave one for the other that they can't (or shouldn't rather) touch with updates or an item shop
---
Wow, I'm in the 2%. I was 27 when I first started to play back in 2004. Get off my lawn
---
Yeah, tbh Blizzard needs to work on their existing and new IPs to please the fans right now. Classic WoW, the next WoW expansion and Diablo 4 all need to be really good to bring back the Blizz playerbase
---
It's all in German
---
ENHANCE!
---
Ya I don't think MC and bwl will be as exclusive as it was back then. There will definitely be way more pugs for those raids come classic. At the time they were considered difficult cause no one knew what they were doing. Different times now.
---
I was beat to it.
---
Inb4 you used Teleport: Stormwind instead of Portal:Stormwind
---
Bunch of disappointed nerds standing around
---
Overwatch and Hearthstone are really stale too. The new dev hires are really going to have their work cut out for themselves. 
---
I’d die for the Horde 
---
Wouldn’t think twice 
---
DarkSpear til Death! 
---
I don’t have friends lol. That’s why I’m rolling a hunter 
---
Idk man, bringing a 6 minute mile down to 4:12 would be pretty awesome assuming you could still progress as if you were a 6 minute runner.
---
Yeah. The first 20 levels felt like a neverwinter nights mmo. Just really buggy. After that I didn't last long. Got 1 character to 21 and another to 22, felt like there was nothing to do, yet I heard it was way worse later on.
---
Could have been a solid game with another couple years to flesh out the content. 
---
Well the same could be said of the person that coined the gif pronunciation and we know how well that went.
---
41-45 here
---
"My group seemed to approve of this tactic."
---
Oh man this made me laugh. No one knew what they were doing. What an awesome time to play games.
---
Came out in 2004, got it Christmas eve, I was 14.
---
&gt;LEG - Wow we really suck, our class mount sucks and our legendary weapons aren't cool.
---
Christ you are full of shit. Shadow OP as fuck in first half of Legion, Disc OP as fuck 2nd half. And how on earth was the Shadow weapon not cool. 
---
Your pet is your friend!
---
Seems like you want to roll hunter. So, roll hunter. There's always a few guild raid spots for good hunters who can CC effectively, regardless of your DPS. The average 1-60 is between 8 and 10 days /played I believe, but if you blast through it or take your time it can easily be shorter/longer.
---
Oh didn't realize you were asking for PvP specifically. The only resource I have seen for a 'vanilla BG meta' would be OhhGee's youtube channel. His WSG comp has 2 mages and 0 warlocks. His AB comp has 3 mages and 1 warlock. 1 rogue for either. 
---
Other then that, stacking 2-4 well geared warriors is very powerful, and much easier to run. In that comp mage would outweigh warlock, since your objective is to enable the melee deathball.
---
I never really thought about this. It's going to be rough adjusting to the retail Classic crowd.
---
No. They're barely an upgrade over thorium arrows and there's absolutely 0 point in farming them outside of going for a world first race. It's nice to get Doomshots the few times you run LBRS but nobody is going to run 10x LBRS per week to supply themselves arrows for raids.
---
Well in that case I should only need 1 min
---
Same age. I'm from South Africa so we had a terrible time with latency. Usually slugged around with a 600ms due to the fact that we rolled on US servers for some reason. Only realized around Wrath the EU would drop it to 200ms. Holy monkey balls this brings back memories
---
Most likely shaman warrior or priest warrior for me.   
---
  
---
Although going returns damage as a druid pally combo would be hilarious
---
Lol as long as I feed the damn thing... 
---
Soulstone
---
Depends what you want to do optimally. If you’re after speed to 60 the best comp is hunter/hunter for sure, but hunter/Druid or hunter/shaman should be decent too. Movement speed and kill speed is basically what makes a good levelling class and hunter is the best at both and you have to find a class that can at least run at a similar speed at low levels to not slow them down. If you’re not so concerned about speed and want to do some dungeons on the way to 60 having a tank helps a ton to get your groups under way.
---
The reduction of down time is 100% worth the wand spec. 
---
It motivates well geared players to keep running zg with the newer players/alts.
---
https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4
---
I think it's more of a case of the young'uns being the ones who hang out here/play on pservers.
---
&gt; Some of the higher end private server guilds don't care about boss DPS specifically, they care about total damage done because that's more of a useful metric in relation to speed clearing, which is how people on private servers keep the competitive spirit of PvE alive.
---
Like I said, I don't really see the point but if they do then more power to them.
---
&gt; The reason why is people have figured out how to optimize for DPS much better than what players did back in the 2000s that entry level raid bosses (ZG, MC mostly) die within 20-60 seconds.
---
I'll be interested to see how it works in a truly Blizzlike engine with people who don't outgear the content.
---
&gt; Here's &lt;Progress&gt;'s 17 minute Molten Core raid. It's actually nuts what these guys did to optimize their clear speed, like using Skull of Impending Doom for the extra move speed, or saving global cooldowns by not dispelling debuffs on targets that won't take damage. That's why the curse is left up on the Hunter.
---
Personally, I think at that stage it's time to move on to a new game.
---
totally soulst...aww, no fair.  Fine, summon infernal then.  Later losers!
---
&gt;I'll be interested to see how it works in a truly Blizzlike engine with people who don't outgear the content.
---
Agree completely.
---
&gt;Personally, I think at that stage it's time to move on to a new game.
---
Why does it matter to you how others spend their time? If they enjoy themselves playing the game the way they do, the last thing they ought to do is quit the game?
---
This is so relatable. Especially the first one is what makes me drop WoW in frustration every time I've tried it since cata. Just let me do it myself! 
---
Meanwhile I was stuck looking for the entrance to dungeon 7 for a week before my uncle happened to see me struggling.
---
Hi 
---
Would you be willing to talk about it on camera?
---
I’m sure he ment keep yourself safe
---
A thousand times this. 2 class combo with high mobility is king. 
---
If you're going alliance I'd say druid. Can go bear and tank, can off-heal the pet and go cat for damage. Between root and ice trap you can pull groups and be fine. Problem is, then you're stuck as a druid if you wanted to be something else. Forget about the best level duo and play what you want. Honestly, any class combo is going to be far more efficient and stress-free than solo leveling even if the leveling speed isn't quite as high.
---
Roll Pally -&gt; bubble hearthstone
---
I'd assume any class with free mounts (pally/warlock) may be more optimal for leveling with enchanting. It is a bitch though if you don't get enough greens 
---
&gt; Why does it matter to you how others spend their time?
---
I didn't say it did, just that personally I would think it was time to move on to a new game if we were clearing MC in under twenty minutes. Roflstomping trivially easy content is fun for me for a little while and then I am over it, I couldn't ever see myself doing it over and over again for weeks.
---
&gt;  If they enjoy themselves playing the game the way they do, the last thing they ought to do is quit the game?
---
In one sense if your hobby was flicking a bowl with a spoon to make it go "tink" and you did that for several hours a day every day, and you were having fun, then it's your life. You can do that if you want.
---
But a lot of people enjoy hobbies for reasons, and those reasons are not fulfilled by hitting a bowl with a spoon for hours, or replaying a video game that you have utterly trivialised.
---
This is just my personal perspective. I have a bunch of games on my shelf that let you play a "New Game Plus" where you take endgame characters into entry-level content and in most of them I have an NG+ save game an hour or two into the game that I will never get back to. 
---
I'll be honest, when I saw "nail art," I thought it meant nail polish art. I believe this is actually called string art...
---
Devotion aura
---
You could always mount up, it’s an outdoor zone
---
Discord is also MIRC plus TS/Vent
---
Tailoring once the economy is established. Your always gathering cloth while you level, and even though that linen robe you crafted only sells for 5-10 silver, you've likely gotten enough cloth to make 20 of them. Selling them all might take a little time , but it pays off. Same with leather working if you pick up skinning. Blacksmithing too to an lesser  extent, cause ore is much less plentiful than cloth/leather.
---
Druid warrior 
---
I'd say get to level 10. You'll barely even notice the rested xp up until then.
---
That 3% hit in prot is pretty valuable while leveling imo.
---
Tame beast
---
Yeah sure why not. I might buy a lucha libre mask though to spice things up.
---
Appreciation does not require first hand experience. But a dummy like you would never understand anyway, stay in your shallow world.
---
Aspect of the Treadmill
---
Yes... Guroob. As in, the Gurubashi trolls. Zul'Farrak for the Farraki trolls. Zul'Aman for the Amani trolls. The pronunciation is consistent, unless you pronounce Gurubashi like "Guh ruh bah shi"? They pronounce Zul'Gurub in the Rise of the Zandalari trailer.
---
Leveled a human pally to 58 as holy.. and didnt even reach 60 with him because I found out my friend from school played but was horde on a different server, so I rerolled.
---
I'll say this about ZG:
---
1: It was fucking fun. Even as someone completely geared out, I loved doing ZG, especially with pugs or with new guild members. It was a nice little challenge that was skill testing enough without being too overbearing.
---
2: The "edge of madness" boss mechanic sucked ass and was not even remotely desireable. The problem was that most of the trinkets were just bad and people would rather just get darkmoon faire cards or Blackhands breadth and forget about it. I knew very few people who had their trinkets.
---
3: the hidden boss, while very interesting, didn't drop loot for casters, so few people did it. A more diversified loot pool would have made it a slam dunk but I recall only fighting it maybe 3 times.
---
4: The tiger morphing gloves on a hunter were absolutely awesome. Seeing a hunter with a sweet ranged weapon and both of those claws was maybe the only time I was envious of another classes armour loadout.
---
Sounds like you already what you are getting into TBH.
---
I was 29, started playing about 3-4 months after the game launched... was super against playing because i was an everquest/everquest 2 guy but my best friend went away to the military and begged me to come play with him... 
---
i fell in love with the game and fully admitted to my friends that i was wrong, WoW was awesome...
---
eating crow never tasted so good!
---
Got my first job at 15 so I could build a PC and not have to play WoW on the crappy family one.
---
Oh and also silence as well for this one :P
---
A fine effigy to burn. 
---
Not really that looks rad good work. 
---
just throw in a pic of the final boss
---
Haha I also I did the “How do I leave my guild?” thing all the time in vanilla (I was like 11-12) and thought it was so clever. I even asked it on a guild chat once and got some guys to quit.  I can’t remember if there was a confirmation pop up or not though, so not sure if they were just messing with me or really did quit by accident. 
---
Dang you just owned me. Never thought about it like that :) Thanks!! I guess I've been calling it the wrong name all these years.
---
I (a hunter) got a pretty decent maze or axe there 2 handed... Can't remember what exactly but it looked really odd. I wasn't really geared at that time so it was super nice for me and I kept it a long time, it was a blue item.
---
We managed to get sever first hakkar kill this run (I was a lug invited by a guy I made friends with while leveling and he rerolled so I could give him really nice hunter tips.) I can't remember exactly but what I do is that I was given the task of kiting these things for the hakkar fight since my online friend really trusted my 13 year old ass to be good at the game (and I was, however he didn't know I was 13) after one wipe we actually managed to kill hakkar. Still remember it 
---
I did love the combo system they had for their combat. And the fact that bear shaman was a melee healer. The game a few great ideas and good systems. It was just severely lacking in content for a long while which really hurt the game.
---
Late 30s and recently divorced at that time. I met a ton of other divorced guys escaping from our crappy reality.
---
Probably a human mage. My first vanilla character that I actually leveled up and got to a high level was a mage, and I played it until dungeon finder came out in WotLk, which motivated me to main a healer.
---
Though I also want to play a rogue, since I hear they can do all kinds of cool things in vanilla that no other class can do due to stealth/vanish/stuns. Not sure which of those two I’ll go with. 
---
my first alt/twink was a mage. eventually even got him t1/t2 geared. 
---
his name was “mainbomber”, cause in zg at most trash you ended up needing a mage being the mainbomber. 
---
*Resist*
---
Great video. Love your content. Fuck the haters. Keep up the great work man you are appreciated!!
---
Hey man dont worry. I started when I was 14 and the guy I quested with a ton was 31 or so and him. 
---
Age really does not matter. For we are all just kids playing a game. 
---
I also now wonder what that guy is up to as I have not spoken to him since WOTLK. 
---
Occam's razor never disapoints
---
Nailed it
---
Gonna suffer thru solo leveling a paladin again. The pain teaches you how to play better. Use to be able to solo things that everyone else said took 2 or 3. 
---
Well you ARE the king of fun, so you'd know best.
---
I’m in the same situation. I can spend a lot of time playing at first and also wanted to play hunter but was worried about finding instance and raid groups if I got too far ahead of most of the tanks and healers. I think though I’ll still go hunter but spend time on professions to get an early lead there. 
---
Go druid shaman and get speed and tank/healer combo
---
My dude, people get really bent up about min maxing but that is not how it actually was in classic. We had ferals and rets in our guild and we were top of the server on alliance side of altar of storms as far as progression. There are 40 people in the raid and the real issue is getting those people together and coordinating a fight.... It honestly is really funny to me when I see people making comments about how bad ret, feral, etc is. The fact of the matter is if you are good at mechanics and know the fights you can down any of the content in Vanilla except some of the stuff in naxx, that gets tough at some spots. 
---
I enjoyed TBC and WotLK, but classic is and always will be my favorite.

I was a chat troll. I’d fire up the kids with the Murloc movie title thing (Saving private murloc), Anal then link a spell (Anal [cleanse]), there was a kid (vinkar) on my server (bronzebeard) who was like a cult leader everyone either loved or hated him so I’d yell that vinkar stole some loot or that vinkar was the best Druid on the server and let things run their course, and a favorite was to stand in front of the auction house or bank in ironforge with the [piccolo of the flaming fire]. Just park there and go to work leave the game running the hate mail I’d get. To be fair though I did all this on my main. 
---
That’s a rough grind man... 
---
Casting it once does not kill you .
---
Luckily for me I loved doing dungeons and almost purely dungeon spammed the whole way. Took me about 3 months if I remember correctly. I didn't know about different specs until my friend told me about them when I rerolled
---
Bypolur and I are still around as well! Also in touch with Arutha/Omnipotent somewhat regularly.

Arcane intellect. Get in a room with all the top WoW developers. Fix retail.

That's funny because I just Googled the exact thing out of boredom - was going to see if the old site or forums were still archived somewhere.
---
Thanks for this thread. Hilarious.

There are no blood elves my friend, think again:

Hard to see from the video, what's going on exactly?

fire mage - sheep pyro pom pyro (espeically if you have zandalari hero charm and talisman of ephemeral power (for +378 spell power)
---
I raged hardcore about a sub getting the 2% critic robes in molten core over me, a regular raider who was trying to get it for weeks.
---
I overreacted and still feel bad about it to this day.
---
I find it really hard to believe that Jin'do, Hakkar or even Mandokir wouldn't have worked just as well, while also being thematically appropriate. But it's not my video obviously and I'm not trying to take away from your creative freedom. Just honest feedback from someone who got turned off the video by your choice of thumbnail.

hunter's tame ability so I could tame a girlfriend
---
Cleanse, save it to auction to the richest person with a fatal disease (like Jobs back in the day. Could fetch 100s of millions if not more. 
---
But shit could hit the fan if they have more than one disease and you cleanse the wrong one XD. Make sure to clearly state in the contract to CYA.

feels more like a 4k crit tbh

---
I notice no one in here is suggesting mage as one of the classes. Portals and free food/water would be a big boon to a leveling group.
---
well it only lasts like 5 seconds so it maybe isnt worth your one and only spell
---
Hemorrhage is not a high priority debuff. It should not remove important buffs.
---
Once (if) you can get full tier 3 (-5 energy on crits with attacks that generate combo points, extra crit chance after eviscerate) a seal fate + hemo build becomes viable.
---
Still not the best, but at least not "disrespectful".
---
Why would YOU bring up any panic? This is simply historical when it comes to the european CMs which NEVER have any insight about what's going on prior to any US information. It's been like that since the very beginning of WoW.
---
Him stating that it's still 2019 means nothing but that there's no new evidence. And I said nothing more than that. There's no panic to it whatsoever.
---
Wooah DK. I still think warrior class chat was the best chat. Haha. 
---
If everyone gets classic I'll probably have to join in too. 
---
I'd just be staying in the capital and rp all the time. 
---
Can’t wait to bubble hearth on people again!!! 
---
What are approximate frost mage PvE stat weights, and more importantly, how should I go about the process for calculating these stat weights?
---
Hunter, very easy and fast to level, great for gold farming and solo play, but they’re always bottom tier dps throughout all of vanilla. Guilds bring no more than 2-3 hunters just for tranq shot.
---
Mage, quite fast to level, also great for gold farming, and they’re top tier dps throughout all of vanilla. Guilds like to bring 5-6 Mages and even more during AQ/Naxx. 
---
It does, because a separate subscription would make it unequivocally clear what the customer wants to pay for.
---
You could have a $10 sub to retail, a $5 sub to classic, or a $12 sub to both.
---
How many Classic players do you imagine would care to save $3 off the retail sub?
---
It's a shared sub because Activision knows they can get away with it, even though 90% of Classic players don't give a fuck about retail.
---
Maybe you should be less focused on how effective your clickbait thumbnails are and more focused on created accurate content?
---
Just a thought.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2S0LgG_1oA) is another one!
---
Yes, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2S0LgG_1oA).
---
How do you provide proof that you can cure something, if it's one cast?
---
I've long said that the whole upvote/downvote system works a LOT better where you have separate counts for both. So you could see that 40 people liked a comment, but 38 disliked it. Instead of the reddit version, where you just see 3 karma.
---
Tips man your content and your voice in the WoW classic community are both so invaluable. Keep doing you
---
A max rank devotion aura is a permanent buff that would make you easily the single toughest human alive by a vast margin.
---
Seems like a solid choice to me.
---
Me and a friend who both played classic are going the same. I'm the Shaman.
---
How can you even kite until 8 for concussion shot? At most you could kite 1 extra auto attack before then.
---
Classic vanilla people
---
Love it! But could you maybe add the option to show race/class?
---
Except it only has a range of like 50 yards... Good luck finding sunken treasure when you need to be within 50 yards to find it.
---
Would be good for finding gold in creeks or overlooked gems in mines maybe.
---
Here's an (optimistic) look for my troll mage, in mostly pre-bis gear. Depends on what stats are like, and what's obtainable at launch though.

Hearthstone ! When you are tired and far from home... 
---
&gt; I'd say that retribution aura is by far the most helpful, but if you ever get into a brawl there's gonna be a bunch of bodies and you wouldn't get much say about it. 
---
"Come at me bro"
---
The kill quests are the worst. The drop rate is so damn low sometimes. Looking at you red ridge! 
---
The best part about the Classic release is that the sheer volume of players will drown out the pserver veterans. 
---
I'm a pserver player myself, but the number of pserver players will not even come close to the amount of people on Classic. Not to mention there won't be any owner favoritism on official Classic either.
---
You obviously never but it.. Just fake dc or sumthin
---
My least favourite is probably the quest in Southshore where you need to collect 10 murloc heads, and apparently only about 10% of murlocs actually have one... This is just one example of a huge number of stupid "Collect X number of vital body parts" quests that grind my gears.
---
It's such lazy game design that absolutely kills immersion for people who actually think about what they're doing. The worst part is that it's so easy to fix. If you want a quest where the goal is to collect 10 things, just make it something that not every fucking murloc HAS to have to even be alive, like tribal beads/charms/etc.
---
My favourite quest is probably the entirety of Duskwood. I know that's not a single quest, but I'm picking it anyway. I love how everything in that zone is interconnected. You even get a quest in Darnassus that explains how the Worgen showed up. Probably some of my favourite vanilla lore, especially the first time I played the game.

---
Hunter is a great first class to level, because it can help fund your other classes.
---
Golden age, in this case, seems to refer to the older generation of gamers. So likely the 55+ age bracket on the survey.
---
I loved/hated the quest in the eastern plaguelands that asked you to kill the lvl 61 elite lich as there was so many mobs including elite around that you could aggro. You HAD to group at least 4 people to succeed it. But I remember getting so happy when we finished it.
---
I think it’s was the quest chain of chromie. Even getting the quest was hard has it was in the middle of the zone filled with lvl 58 mobs.
---
Coming in new/unexperienced with a vanilla leveling guide 7-10 days played for 60. Coming in doing content at a leisurely pace 10-20 days played for 60.

---
If you've got nothing better to do with your timethen standing next to an afk person for a three minutes while a wolf tears you a new asshole, to give them a five-minute disease that's no big deal, and can be cleansed by three different classes...
---
But what constitutes as a single point of armor? I can wrap myself in tissue paper and say I have armor on.  
---
How do you quantify this in the real world? What if aura is just skin thickness? Does that mean your skin will act as though it's 735 times the thickness of normal skin? I guess you'd excel in MMA.  
---
Hammer of Wrath. You'd be a hoot at hospitals.  
---
Blizzard's profit revival
---
Funny how it works, I actually have fond memories of doing this quest. 
---
Did it with a friend, fear of over aggro kept us on our toes, there were chests along the way, the occasional Horde in sight. Plus I've always liked questing in Hillsbrad because it's got a frontier feel.
---
10 10 would do again
---
Bloody Bone Necklaces anyone?  
---
Have you any data for that claim? You could have what you want it doesn't influence what AcitivionBlizz does with the money.
---
Save 3$ ? That shows the flaw in your thinking. You are not saving anything. It's classic  compsensatory pricing. 
---
mavajo, I did too. It also coincided with finishing grad school and getting a job and in general having responsibilities. Popped back in for a bit in WoD, hated it, was convinced by friends to try Legion, hate it, refused BfA. Now I buy a month now and then when I'm going to have more free time than usual and want to do some old achievements or work on collections.
---
My question is whether you are main only or altaholic? My plan is to have enough alts to cover all professions. I'll go dual gather on my first 60. My alts will be rushed to level 10 and get to at least 35 eventually...
---
We grew up, finished college, got jobs, built families, and WoW slipped into the background. But holy Hannah I'm coming back for Classic!
---
Okay guys. Just like the last time someone released a word cloud, we have to guess what video the content creators will make next based off of this one (A well known content creator released a warlock class guide video 6 days after warlock showed up very prominently on the last word cloud. Which was funny regardless of coincidence. My parentheses section is now longer than my original message. Awesome)  
---
"No Child Left Behind" destroyed American education (assuming commenter with questionable math skills is American). To be fair, I brain fart math occasionally, too.
---
Mage frost, and shadow priest. Stanglehorn remember that combo I can tell.
---
6+ mo here, because shift work and long hours and... wife. \^\_\^  All things I didn't have the first time around!
---
Least favorite are escort and underwater quests.
---
All time favorite: Verigan's Fist (level 20-ish pally mace) quest chain. Pure adventure, some commitment for sure but rewards you handsomely for it in the end.
---
Worst quest for me is the chicken escort in Tanaris. Favoritt is most definitely the Ancient Petrified Leaf quest for hunters. I was so damn proud when I got my bow/staff. 
---
Same here, but I started playing 2 years later in tbc when I was 24.
---
How big is the stun resist for Orc PvP? If you run a BG as an orc then immediately play another as a different race, would you notice the difference? I'm definitely playing a warrior just torn between tauren and orc
---
The chicken escort quest across Tanaris on a PvP server. Takes forever, has a stupidly long respawn time if you fail it so you can't try again, and it takes you across the entire map, past a bunch of high traffic questing areas. All it takes is one rogue to ambush you while you're fighting and you're back to square one. And when you finally manage to finish it you have to go to the other side of the world to turn it in.
---
A close second would be any collect X quest where the total number of mobs that drop X that exist is less than X. Especially if the drop rate isn't 100%.
---
I'm perfectly happy to go and slaughter some of your ancient rivals and bring back proof of their demise, but once I've committed genocide and driven them to extinction, and that's still not enough for you, it breaks the immersion a bit.
---
40mil a year for what, running the company to the ground? Nice investment.

---
How you quantify fantasy toughness is pretty confusing, since it obviously conflicts with actual physics.
---
For the sake of argument I'd say that innate armour is simply supernatural toughness. So an armour value 20 times higher than a regular adult male would equate to 20x the toughness. Bones like steel, muscles like braided cable, skin like boiled leather, etc. Obviously these would simply mimic the characteristics of resistance, not the other physical properties, since skin as tough as boiled leather couldn't actually be hard like boiled leather.
---
Hunter - Druid was insane, stealth, shred and continue on. We could take some insane pulls as her pet tanked even better with thorns and a mark of the wild. Did not even have to spec into claw dmg since all I did was ravage, shred and ferocious bite. 
---
The downtime was minimum and the movement speed was well synergised.  10/10, would recommend again.
---
We are going Druid - Mage this time tho, but we are not much worried about the synergy as time @ 60 far outweights time as 1-59 pretty quickly.
---
Warrior then? 
---
Usually dead
---
Mind Control
---
I would personally suggest skinning + tailoring at the start. At 60 you can reroll skinning to herb for better money and tail to engineering when you make the BoPs for yourself. Skinning is great while leveling for some extra money and herb will make you run all over the place for flowers. And you can always have someone make the potions for you.
---
warlocks ;d
---
Satyr horns is easily the whackest quest. 
---
Either a mage or lock. Probably a lock even though I do want to play mage more, but there are always SO many mages. Most played class behind rogues I think
---
I'm doing priest, warlock :) 
---
Activision has literally nothing to do with classic and barley anything, if anything with blizzard
---
Except you only get level appropriate food for 5 lvls and drinks for 3 :( had a friend who would accept my conjured gifts because appearantly they weren't good enough :(
---
Ahh is dropping combat 5 seconds not 6? In which case yes that makes sense.
---
Me and my friend are going Pally/Lock since lock will be able to put out heavy dmg with a healer and WW for tanking elites etc. Also both of us get free Mount at 40 so we'll be able to get a solid economy straight of the bat.
---
Its helpful to run 2 classes that have the same movement, i.e if you go Hunter / Pally the Hunter wont be able to use cheetah cause the pally Will fall behind
---
poison sand.
---
Those results surprise me. I thought most players were over 18
---
It's tame beast not tame bitch
---
Assuming equal gear I'd say it's 50/50. Probably in mages favour if the hunter doesn't have frost reflector.  
---
1-59 the mage is gonna die 9/10 times tho.
---
Hearthstone
---
yeah because throwing sand into people's eyes makes them disoriented for 10 seconds without being able to do anything
---
Retribution aura I reckon, then embark on a short career in MMA. Or Aspect of the Cheetah and become a surprise Olympian
---
Best quest is a super random secret quest: In Feralas in the mountains behind the hippogryphs, every once in a while you’ll find a clickable egg. You can only hold one egg at a time, and you have to [turn it in in Tanaris](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2741). It’s repeatable and you can get rewards if you have “fine” or “good eggs”
---
There are two quests in WoW that have actually made me cry: [“Deep Ocean, Vast Sea”](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=982) in Darkshore. You have to go underwater into a sunken ship with massive amounts of murlocs guarding it. You either died to the murlocs or running out of breath. By the time you got to your body the murlocs you killed had respawned. 
---
The [Alliance Druid aquatic form quest](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5061) was so hard for me for whatever reason I had to have my friend do it for me. You had to go to the bottom of the ocean in Darkshore where you get fatigued and get a locket. I could not get to the water’s surface in time and I would die at every attempt. 
---
I cam here to mention this quest. How do they not have heads?!
---
It is though, every time a new raid gets out. Catch-up gear allows you to go to the new raid, it doesn't push anything out. I'm not saying it's a good thing but you're just wrong. 
---
This is why you don't do escort quests
---
why can I only cast it once?
---
We're planning on Druid (tank), Shaman (healer). 
---
Both of us get early movement speed boosts. We fill the two most difficult to fill positions for dungeons. Tank+healer means we can two-man some elite quests in the open world, albeit slowly. We're planning on a PvP server, so having access to stealth can allow us to surprise other players, who might just see the Shaman and assume that's all who's there. Furthermore, having us both able to heal increases our survivability, and we can both res each other if required. For regular questing/grinding, he can just dps as per normal whilst I stay in bear/cat and heal both of us as required, meaning minimal downtime. All we really need to worry about is him drinking occasionally. 
---
2 Frost Mages who AoE pull 30 mobs. 
---
also, from level 40 you can do blizzard + hurricane and have access to innervate for another quasi-evocation. it's a nice combo.
---
Come on over and submit your times friend! :)
---
Came here for this comment
---
True. Whoever downvoted this must actually want vanilla to fail
---
stop beating yourself  
---
Well, objectively retail wow is the better game.
---
More excitement in less time invested. However, this is pretty much the era of games we are in. Everything is overengineered to appeal to the broadest audience possible, and therefore lacks artistry.
---
This relates to the problems modern pop music faces. You have Artists that are capable of true masterpieces, but that isn't what pays the bills.
---
There should be more reward for culture and artistry, rather than pushing short term financial success to the limit.
---
Yeah this is true with decent gear at lvl60, while leveling there is very little you can do
---
Mages get hard countered by certain classes in my experience. You cant really do anything against a good hunter, shaman, shadow priest or even a warlock. When it comes to group pvp you are great though
---
People who like the face roll gold fish attention span instant reward style of game WoW turned into. 
---
If I read 'objectively better' or 'objectively worse' or 'objectively good' or 'objectively bad' one more time regarding WoW- no, regarding **anything**, I'm going to hang myself on the ceiling fan by the testicles.
---
The moment you got your leaf quest done, you were a very proud hunter. It took me forever to finish it, because there was always somebody else there, except late at night. If i weren't unemployed for a while right around that time, i dond't think i would have ever had the chance to complete it. Full servers can be a pain in the ass. 
---
TO THIS DAY those stupid murlocs have the [fishing gloves enchant recipe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11152) that has eluded me for 13+ years
---
&gt; More excitement
---
This is a troll post. There's nothing exciting about bfa.
---
From the trolls in STV right? :D
---
A video featuring people discussing vanilla / Classic servers.
---
Modern wow is better in the long-term. It is an expertly decorated, perfectly cooked cake. It's a great experience. But eventually it'll rot your teeth, and you'll get tired of it.
---
Whereas classic wow is a five-star home cooked meal with all the trimmings, including lots of healthy vegetables. It's less powerful in each bite, yet in the long-term you feel amazing eating it. 
---
"Better"
---
I don't get more excitement with retail wow. Maybe you meant to say more polished, but everytime I start a month of retail, I don't feel very rewarded at all. It doesn't feel earned. 
---
So, I don't think objectively it's a better game. I think you meant to say subjectively there. Retail may have small pieces that feel improved but the overall experience is... lacking. 
---
Samophlange is the best quest line.
---
That will objectively hurt
---
We need back the night elf mohawk commercials!
---
I'm not sure I want more addon support or larger servers, but I'm down for the rest.
---
My brother and I are doing the same. Tauren shaman for me and undead warrior for him!!!
---
That's not what I said: you claimed that I feel a certain way about something which is different to merely saying that my presumptions are wrong. It's likely just a communication error and your intentions almost certainly weren't malicious, just letting you know so you can phrase things better next time and be more effective at getting your point across.
---
The dudu quest the chest is clickable from the outside of the ship. So you could be don in a minute with it.
---
got the ore yesterday from the first surveyor i killed. SUCK IT
---
5 seconds is all i need
---
That's a good point! I didn't consider the context of alts properly so I forgot there could be a gold sink ready to use!
---
Well not a lot at least. The mythic raids are fun. That's about it for me. Everything inbetween sucks. 
---
True that. I love how braindead mara farm is personally. A hunter could down princess naked if they wanted to, and rotgrip only needs a minimal amount of gear to kill if you do it correctly. Tinkerer is only a pain if he fears your pet into other mobs and that's rare enough that you can just FD amd try again nbd.
---
the stun resist is STRONG
---
im going druid in vanilla for the 500th time
---
i love the meme attention it gets and i honestly love how strong bear tanking actually is
---
druid healing makes me want to jump off the roof though
---
Paladin leveling guide. Have they done that one yet? It will be out within 6 days.  
---
Hmm, that's a relatively good point. Can put in a no disease cure clause for money back, but I guess there is no guarantee!
---
And yet they were all in naxx
---
Better than retail. I thought that was clear.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding and we're arguing different things here?
---
No objection there 
---
Hunter epic bow quest. Best and worst. It's so difficult and really teaches you what hunters are capable of. On the other hand, if anyone randomly tries to help you even with the best of intentions you're fucked. I hate it but I love it too.
---
Germans (not all ofc) still use ts3, even though most of player base usses discord. Now that is called dedication.
---
The paradox is that no one who played vanilla can tolerate BfA therefore you have never played vanilla therefore you're talking out your arse. 
---
Mage will still be able to farm gold easily, levels fast, and stays relevant throughout. Honestly it's too hard to tell because it depends on what your end game goals are, like if you want your healer to be top tier then go that first and level a gold farming alt on the side for example.
---
I'd level to like 20 then just fish or something idk. Wow is not madr for that idea.
---
Call of Water :) (Shaman water totem quest line)
---
Same! I think my guild had 1 player who was like 15  whereas everyone else was in college or older.
---
How is no changes not in this at all, let alone not being one of the "bigger" texts.
---
Me to if it makes you feel any better 
---
No changes?
---
&gt; Better than retail. I thought that was clear.
---
&gt; Maybe I'm misunderstanding and we're arguing different things here?
---
I think so. I was commenting on the basis for the prevalence of rabid "#nochanges" posters around here, that they probably played WoW as their first real CRPG game and before they were capable of being critical toward game content.
---
Those of us who were a bit older when we played it, and aware of its shortcomings as well as its strengths, seem to be more open to potential improvements.
---
&gt; Like, I'm really not sure what you're getting at. Vanilla has its strengths and weaknesses; just like retail. But, for me, those strengths far outweigh the weaknesses.
---
Not so much when it comes to retail.
---
Well sure, you're *here*. This is a forum that only attracts people who liked vanilla. Everyone here likes vanilla.
---
We just have vicious knife fights amongst ourselves over whether an eternal, fossilised 1.12 is a better or worse vanilla than one with ongoing improvements.
---
Here's mine:  
---
* Vanilla  
---
Thread on best quests, and no mention of the Darrowshire chain yet?  How is that possible?
---
I don't think "objectively" means what you think that it means.
---
There are a lot of more exciting games for way less time invested -- every FPS and ARPG is way more exciting than anything in a tab-targeted RPG. Is Modern Warfare VII objectively the best game ever because it's so exciting instantly?
---
A big part of WoW's appeal is the sense of progression. Going from a nobody to a hero is more progression than just starting out as a hero.
---
I have played wow for 14 years. Most of the elemental parts of wow have objectively improved.
---
However, subjectively the game isn't an mmo since cata anymore and I don't want to play it anymore, since I mostly get the feeling of wasting my time while playing the game.
---
Objectivity isn't the metric games should care about though. If the game feels like crap even though it appears to be good according to numbers, it is a crap game.
---
12yo in late 2007 to early 2008
---
&gt; And if they didnt they would be breaking the law. You have a fiduciary obligation to your shareholders, and keeping redundant positions on the payroll is not responsible.
---
Oh please. Kindly show me one case, ever, of someone getting sued for keeping on PR staff as part of a perfectly profitable, prosperous corporation.
---
This "fiduciary obligation" malarkey that gets trotted out to defend every bit of corporate bastardry is practically mythological. The risk of getting sued for not engaging in this kind of layoff is effectively zero.
---
Also, the very idea that corporations ought to have no moral responsibility to employees or the general public is deeply evil.
---
At this point I don't think I'd join a guild who still pushes the use of Ventrilo.
---
They do need to advertise it more. I only happened to learn about classic late last year because I was reading up on Blizzard's failed Diablo Immortal announcement.
---
Why would you ever pick stealth over vanish? Vanish also puts you into stealth, but you can use it to get out of fights as well.
---
I wish I could down vote you more than once
---
I'm doing Paladin with a Mage buddy.
---
Not too fond of the megaserver concept tbh.
---
The thing I absolutely hated about WoW was that I couldn’t get enough of her, I dreamed of her and when she died I felt like a piece of me die as well. I still cherish the memories at the end of every bottle. 
---
Kinda weird wish of yours
---
Yeah at 60 your absorbs can tank a fair chunk of their burst and you can stay alive through a single rotation.
---
And you had to glue them and keep them slowed to get in their dead zone.

I have fond memories of ZG. It was my first raid. My newly found guild invited me to join even though I was only lvl 58. I remember many of my spells missing.
---
Its 30% its completely op.

Tauren is good too but not on the same level.

Alas, Andorhal

Hunter paladin is god mode in pvp.
---
Night elf stealth so pally gets targeted then you start melting faces. And with BoF you are a killing machine.
---
I’m going ne hunter myself for this reason.
---
If people think it's a crap game, it isnt objectively a good game...
---
Checkmate. 
---
Retail wow is objectively better in satisfying instant gratification because there’s no grind (e.g. Dungeon finder vs actually looking for a group)
---
Vanilla wow is objectively better in building social relationships and feeling as though you are actually in a *world* of Warcraft. Having been away and played some retail wow lately it shocks me how so little interaction there is between players, and how despite added continents that the world doesn’t feel as large as it used to. 
---
You’re right in that modern pop music makes squillions for the artists and hey maybe it’s not your taste, but that doesn’t mean pop music is objectively bad.

I used to sheep + teleport in vanilla haha

Polymorph lasted so long. Sometimes I would even portal instead so they could see where I had gone. Just to annoy them a bit more.

Favorite is Tooga's Quest, initially it looks as if it's going to be hell as you have to escort this turtle from the bottom corner of Tanaris all the way to the opposite end (granted he at least follows you, and not the other way around), but it's all made up for with the humor of the quest. Tooga has all these stupid little things he tells or asks you about when being escorted, and then the ending it just brilliant, it's always stuck with me since I first did it.
---
Worst experience for me was Call of Water, as I died on the Water Elemental in Silverpine, which meant I had to go back all the way to southern Barrens and get the item to summon it again. There's also an escort quest in one of the Furbolg dens in Ashenvale that's an absolute nightmare, especially on PvP servers.
---
If you're PVPing at all you're going to want a nice, big, slow 2h weapon as a hunter. 
---
When people come into your deadzone, you have to make them regret it.
---
Did Nostalgia even make it??
---
i feel like you attach your own unique meaning to words and then communication doesn't work outside of your inner dialogue. 
---
Druid can run fast before lvl 40, stealth, and teleport moonglade. Warrior can do none of these things. Druid player will have to wait on the warrior a lot, hope he's patient.
---
Paladin reaches you to play better now? Teaches you to want better, maybe.
---
Honest opinion here, sorry if that sounds a bit rough. I don't think it's a smart move to split raids and PvP, as most of the gear in vanilla comes front high-end PvE and you can't effectively gear a character just from PvP alone, unless you're super commited to ranking but your post doesn't sound like it. You will want to take part in some PvE raids to be competitive in PvP.
---
If private servers statistics are any indication, hunter is a **very, very popular** class which is quite the paradox because it falls short on damage as early as MC with a very poor scaling, basically acting as a buff bot for melees with aura/wolf, and slowly losing value until you only want 2 per raid for the mandatory tranq shot. 
---
It's probably the "DPS" class with the lowest demand all throughout the raid content while at the same time being a highly popular pick for the ease of leveling (and play), so it might be difficult to find yourself a raid spot or a raiding guild to work towards that gear to stay competitive in PvP all throughout Classic.
---
On the other hand, healers are in high demand for PvE as well as PvP and you will have a much easier time finding a group for both game modes and accumulate gear. Now don't fall into the trap of making a druid because it's basically the hunter of healers: very inefficient, very niche role, small demand, barely 1-2 per raid group, high competition for a slot.
---
I think it's best to level a healer (or any hard to level class) in the early stages of the release because every zone will be massively crowded and you will have a very easy time grouping. High competition for tags will also prevent you from being ambushed by mobs, any unfortunate pull with a couple mobs that would usually send you right back to the graveyard will be taken care of by people jumping to tag your extra. Hunter or Mage are very efficient on their own and will do a much better job at leveling solo later into the server's life. 
---
Being a healer in the first wave of players on your server will grant you immediate access to leveling dungeons, pre-raid dungeons, early raids. You will meet a lot of people in groups and dungeons early on and start building that friend list to socialize on your server, make yourself a name, join a guild, etc. A player willing to heal a leveling dungeon is just as rare as finding a tank and people will notice your good will for sure and add you. Less likely if you are hunter#487934 on the server.
---
Well this summer you get to fuck the ever-loving shit out of her younger, prettier sister
---
Of all the classes I played I found paladin to be the most adaptable and most enjoyable for solo work. Lack of DPS can get annoying but meh I enjoyed it. 
---
The "nostalgia" argument is used by younger players who feel a sense of animosity that they are essentially the embodiment of 'late to the party'.
---
The argument essentially means that *nothing* created prior to when these people were alive, was ever any good. That way, they never missed out on anything. Afterall if "nostalgia" applies to one thing, then surely it applies to it all? Elvis Presley? Sucks. Michael Jackson? Shit. Queen? Manure. Godfather part 1 and 2? Excrement. Apocalypse Now? Dogshit. Die Hard? Garbage. Original Doom? Horseshit. Super Mario Bros 3? Crap.
---
But Nicki Minaj? Awesome. Taylor Swift? Amazing. Marvel Movie Number 45? Spectacular. Fortnite? Greatness. Modern WoW? Perfection.
---
Its odd, because some of my own favorite movies and albums were released *before* i was even born. I never took it as a slight to me or my generation, that something great existed before me, instead i just...um..enjoyed it? Weird right?
---
I didn't like them, I'm sure other people did.   
---
I'm actually playing holy atm it's not bad for raids but I don't like the whole class design blizz does atm of "doing SKILL\_A to lower times for SKILL\_B in an endless loop" although some of the new raid bosses aren't too bad for healing they have some pretty heavy hits that need to coordinate healing cooldowns.   
---
kek yeah I like it when my spec works. 
---
...mid raid...
---
“Hey guys, anyone have any meat 😬”
---
...2 bosses later...
---
“Hey guys, I’m out of ammo 😬”
---
...and the huntard was born.
---
does this account for the fact that hunter players tend to be... how can I put it lightly... special? or are you using solid players as baseline?
---
[https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=28133&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=41266](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=28133&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=41266) This is the raid I'm talking about. And that is not huge dps, but at the time it took me to #11 of all the rogues on the server. Talking about average dps. And I was vastly undergeared compared to the top rogues. You can reach loads higher dps on a geared feral. Warriors are from another world in terms of dps, but rogues are not that big when talking about single-target dps in comparison to feral druids. They have huge cooldowns which may boost them up a lot in short fights but in the long run their average dps is not that high in comparison to what feral deals.
---
What makes you think people only want some skinny bloodelf. Have you not seen all the furry talk? Or what about our boys that want them a big hairy bear. And let's not forget the female NE the first real love, we all watched her running through the woods on that trailer. 
---
Pretty accurate.  Also impressed with the amount  of synonyms you used for the word shit.
---
Personally I recommend Hunter/Hunter. One goes Beastmaster and one goes Marksman. I played vanilla with my boyfriend at the time. We were duo dwarf hunters and we dominated! Everything died within seconds. I super recommend it. It does not even matter that you share the same gear. The fun of it all of how quickly you shred through enemies is well worth whatever downsides come from same gear dependency.
---
Side note: if one of you is into crafting, sharing the same gear type might work because to level leatherworking you are making a ton of the same gear already.
---
Worst quest is Garenzo's Orders.
---
You know, I'm sick of this point of view. Companies don't just spring out of nothing, they have to raise money to build something, which means a bunch of people had to give them their money. Without this concept of shareholders, we would't have the capitol liquidity to build amazing things in the first place. 
---
Stock buybacks aren't some capitulation, they're the corporate version of paying your home or car payment. Now they could also have done this as a dividend, but the advantage of stock buyback is you start to move closer back to being an independent entity which can set its own direction. 
---

---
The voraussichtlich doesn't give much confidence to a summer release imo. Sounds like it isn't as clear cut as expected.
---
This is exactly what it is. I think you've hit the nail on the head exactly with the whole 'late to the party' the nostalgia argument is because they missed out on the original version and thus the best (in my eyes anyway) 
---
Because it's not a PvE weapon anyway and is only used for PvP (with the exception for Ret paladin I guess), there's no real reason why hunters should not get one. Raptor Strike hit like a truck with a real twohander.
---
Don't forget all the lovely little murlocs by their lakes.
---
I don’t remember anything from Cataclysm, but I have extremely elaborate memories of one specific quest chain, in which you help Tirion Fordring - a hermit who lives on the bank of a river - get in touch with his estranged son Taelen. 
---
The son was a bigwig in the Scarlet Crusade, whereas Tirion was ostracised for saving an orc (Eitrigg). There’s a fantastic short story too, look it up - it’s titled “Of Blood And Honor”, and IIRC Metzen wrote it himself.
---
The long quest chain gets you to gather various keepsakes around Lordaeron from the Fordring family’s past, and bring them to Taelen, to remind him of his father. The son misses his father and wants to leave the Scarlet Crusade, but the final escort quest ends tragically.
---
This is my most memorable WoW experience, after 12 years or so of playing. 
---
I seriously considered rolling on a pserver JUST to redo this quest chain. Then Blizz announced about Classic coming this summer, and I decided to wait.
---
Why is melee PvP more important than hunter PvP?
---
Hint: It's not. Let hunters roll for it.
---
Bear Tongues at Tarren Mill is terrible.
---
&gt;Also you shouldn't need to raid PVE content for six weeks for trinkets that are only good for PVP.
---
Why not? The majority of PvP gear in Vanilla comes from raiding. Why should you not put in some effort into obtaining the gear you want?
---
This community is so toxic.

Sorry bro. I thought it looked great. Keep up the good work. 
---
It was part of the Darrowshire quest chain I think (if Chromie was involved, it probably was). It was a small town that got ravaged by the scourge, players got to reenact their last battle. 
---
Fun fact: Blightcaller kept souvenirs from that fight in his house. Chromie said she doesn’t know why. That guy is even creepier than we know.
---
I did on another thread here! Absolutely great story. You can’t not fall in love with WoW lore after doing that one.

---
I have almost given up this community. Posts I made that were factual in origin backed up with proper sources in old patch notes etc for how stuff works have gotten 20+ downvotes. I just dont see the point hanging out here really when you get downvoted based on how much people like you or not rather than the content of your posts.
---
Your point holds, but didn't you just argue that every FPS and ARPG is *objectively* more exciting?  Because for me that isn't true.
---
Community managers iz extremely vital to keep up communication between the studio and audio. Granted there were some that got laid off with good reason, like esports teams. But laying off people that communicate with your playerbase and helps your company not look like it's run by soulless corporate drones is very stupid.
---
Especially since those gm/cm will be needed again once classic returns. Or another game launches etc. 
---
Firing them is a short term solution to save a little bit of money, that will bite them in the ass when they have to hire new people and then train them. Which will cost more.
---
Disagree. I think the current retail model of every new raid completely replacing the old one has been one of the worst decisions they made. Vanilla and to some extent TBC managed to keep all the content relevant throughout the entire expansion. Should that not be the goal?
---
Same. AQ20 seem to be have designed similar to ZG in that it's an outdoors open raid with multiple paths to take, but there's no originality there. No bosses you can summon, no enchants, mounts or anything special. It just feels rushed.
---
Definitely. Great post.
---
Reminds me of that guy yesterday who made a post claiming classic wasn't as good as everyone claims.. and went on to argue "when people say classic, they are generally referring to everything before cata including tbc and wotlk" lmao
---
He got about 30 downvotes and everyone called him out... but he reacted the same as the nostalgia crowd does when called out, and instead of seeing the millions of people and 99% population directly telling them exactly how they feel, he DOUBLED DOWN and stuck to his made up lie about things that happened before he was born because he couldn't bare to be caught looking "dumb". 
---
No possible way that people who have been playing the game for literally 10+ years could have more experience and maaaaybeee know what they are talking about when they say they like something lol
---
Teabagging =/= obscuring hundreds of people’s view for *hours*.

Honestly I think the chances of us getting progressive itemisation is incredibly low.

Omg relik?! It’s me
---
Melee: Reckoning paladin, enhancement shaman.  
---
Ranged: Pyroblast mage, soulfire warlock.  
---
Lol right. I was thinking the same. So many people do this too.
---
A veteran druid healer admitting in your thread that healing sucks, is a piece of information you want to strongly consider when choosing.  
---
I would instead ask the next question: How competitive are you when it comes to raid spots? What are you willing to do to be in the top tier of mages on the server?  
---
You like it when it is brainless like WOTLK. Bubble spam and can never oom. If you think priest sucks atm you are a shitter plain and simple
---
He'll accept the fact that black lotus isn't soul bound in the patch Classic is launching in and then send it to his alchemy alt.  
---
Solid players of equal skills of course. Mage is probably easier at lower skill levels.
---
iunno about that, maybe for you personally. 
---
I’m running Druid and my buddy is running Druid. It works out because we both get 30% and 40% movement speed around the Same level, and while one of us stealths the other can be stealth too
---
Or it’s an extremely inconvenient and non QoL friendly game that many people won’t enjoy because by modern game design it’s simply outdated. If it were WoTLK I could see an argument but vanilla was and is aids. Sure some people like the aids but a lot are sure going to be disappointed with the awakening that the memories they had don’t exactly stack up. 
---
If you are truly planning on keeping professions on one character, then I'm not sure how you're going to coordinate enchanting with alchemy and not have an herbalist. If you plan on buying the herbs then being an alch is pointless, just have a guildie make it.  
---
Oh shut the fuck up lmao 
---
100%. Lol.
---
He's applying his own SUBJECTIVE meaning to what "objectively better" means... literally the opposite of the English definition haha

---
Dwarf and Gnome master race
---
what was that from? xD
---
&gt;Honestly I think the chances of us getting progressive itemisation is incredibly low. 
---
Oh no ;(
---
I think it would appear that way because most children don't have the coordination to run a guild where a lot of player interaction occurs. Also most people back then didn't have mic's. I couldnt manage that many people so young and  didn't until Wrath and even then I co-led one. Most people also group with people their age and if older people are leading guild they are inviting people their age most likely.
---
The actual answer is that when a shadow priest starts his rotation on you and reaches the mind flay phase, your face is typically melted off of your body by that point if he has good spell power gear, and the fight is over pretty quickly.  
---
I remember in vanilla I ran into the rank 14 shadow priest on Alliance in WSG and he killed me in less than 3 seconds on my mage. I was badly geared for PVP but I was absolutely shocked. I actually still talk to that guy to this day.  
---
Mining is even easier.

Sinsemill - NE Druid on Stormreaver.

Still playing on him today , but playing on stormrage. 
---
The main issues are that you can't get the defense cap and you don't have the block, so you will lag behind progression.
---
Into MC healers may struggle to keep up with the spikes, into BWL warriors have a distinct gear advantage as their gains from gear outstrip you. Once you get to into AQ you start to gain more, especially of you can get a DFT to cover your hit needs.
---
You will always be fine as MT for the previous content.
---
Worst thing you can do. Never pick in classic a class only because it's easier to get a raid spot. 
---
I leveled a pally towards the end of my old WoW career for s n giggles and it was tough going from Ret to Holy... but made sense haha dig it. fire mages are powerful 
---
well 750 armor is about the same as wearing a full set of level 40 ish plate in game. So I figure my skin would be as resilient as steel without armor on. It's not like I have a practical use for it but hey more protecc isn't bad.

How often do you get attacked?

Air conditioning: visiting Winterspring or finding a mage who's good at frost magic.

I had most fun playing with druid and warlock talent tree because I HAVE LITERALLY NO IDEA never played one or even tried to level one.. most other classes I did to like 20 so I semi knew. 
---
And I know they were VERY rare on my server but Moonkins just look so fun albeit not that powerful and tricky to play. But I know for leveing prooooobably not the best way to go hahah
---
Last I played EVE Online a couple of years ago, it was the choice of the big corps and alliances there because of the fact that it is so highly configurable, especially for large groups that need splitting into smaller sub-groups.
---
I just posted on another comment. Lock is one character I literally never played or even tried. I know I hated them in PVP but this is the most fun talent tree I like to play with cause I just don't know whats good. I like to see these in all 3 of them, thank you
---
I know the real world is better written but I really don't have much here. I'd rather train under the Cenarion Circle briefly before becoming strong enough to join the Argent Dawn.
---
Arcane Intellect? An interesting choice, ever read Flowers for Algernon?
---
Yeah but he could achieve peak human performance with an extra 30%. That's record breaking speed.
---
I remember talking about wow with everyone in middle school at lunch. It was the thing, everyone played it, I feel it was a major turning point to videogames not becoming a nerdy thing that was shund. The game was so massive a lot of my friends parents even played at the time, and they were not videogame people. 
---
Being very honest here...if you want to work REALLY hard and get pretty OK results, then druid. It's pretty fun class and pretty OK. You can fill in to tank 5 mans and stuff, but nobody will want you to heal 5 mans because you don't have a out of combat rez with zero cooldown, and many won't want you to tank because....they're ignorant.
---
Mage DPS is highly sought after compared to other DPS, you have your own food and water and portals and you have amazing leveling and solo ability and best quality of life IMO.  It's just a much better class, albeit if you're like me it's not as fun as a druid...but the druid struggle is real.  Be prepared to be frustrated.
---
well met!
---
And it's not just one-way communication. Social teams also talk to the devs and management on behalf of the users. They're the ones trawling, reading and listening.
---
If you’re going hunter, you’re kind of forcing the other person into a high run speed class. Shaman with ghost wolf, Druid with improved cat form / cheetah, unless you’re fine with navigating the world slower. 
---
Mining is possible of course however, you’ll likely need to appropriately adjust your levelling route to include some cave/mine areas grinding etc. 
---
I was 18 when WoW released. I loved it at the time. I also enjoy retail. Do I think some people are going to enjoy classic? Yep. Do I think some people are going to be in for a kick in the ass when they realize that some things about vanilla that we romanticize were actually dogshit? Definitely. 
---
This also works the other way. "Anything that isn't vanilla is trash." Equally emotional and odd. 
---
I found them to be about the same. I do mining more than Herbalism, and a lot of times the mining nodes I need are in places I just can't reach because of my level. I just remember where it was and go back to those areas when it's easier for me to get the node. But overall they're about the same in my opinion. 
---
Here's the thing, your mind blast crits can hit VERY hard and with Inner Focus it is pretty laugh out loud awesome. I went from farming gear as holy and did a respec to shadow (which of course at 40 I leveled as) for PvP and was SHOCKED at how hard I hit.  Undead is best because you have SWP plus Devouring plague shadow instant damage and with Mind Blast and flay you simply FUCK SHIT UP BAD.
---
However, you got OOM and drink more than a mage so it's crazy super, fun awesome damage fun times, but you will drink a metric shitton of water and have a lot of PvP downtime.  Also a bit of advice there, don't swap out of shadow for to heal yourself unless there's a break in the action and you need to just get back up in health because don't it in combat is just a waste. Do your best to pump out damage and risk death.
---
Yeah this is very well said, and mind flay slows people down and keeps pumping even when they strafe, so it's pretty amazing.  
---
Back then not.
---
But, as they discussed in the podcast, it’s hypocritical to shun people for wanting TBC and saying that Blizzard should never deliver it, on a forum for Classic, a game that people shunned and told Blizzard they should never deliver it.
---
I’m going to love every minute I’m playing Classic WoW, but I can’t wait for TBC and even Wrath, warts and all, just like Vanilla.
---
Yeah hopefully. If there's no unarmored mount's I'll stick to Dreadsteed.
---
FYI @ 10 hours a week and 3 months to level that is assuming you make 60 in 5 hours /played.
---
If that is really your intent then you will have ZERO time to do any professions. You'd better be running an optimized route from a speedrunner and playing a hunter or lock because 5 days played is only a few hours longer than the vanilla world record speed run, set by Jaina who made that famous horde leveling guide lol
---
You will be looking at more like 6months + if you only play 10 hours a week AND waste a lot of time doing professions. Thats usually what people are referring to when they give you this advice, they are just summarizing it ya know?
---
I havent read the rest of your post but will go back and do so. I just saw this glaring oversight in the first few lines and wanted to chime in
---
...and liked to drink a lot of water. Sorry I keep saying this but everyone needs to know that you have A LOT of downtime drinking with a priest and water can get expensive unless you have mage buddies to help you out.
---
Cleanse or Lay on Hands is obviously the best answer because you would heal someone at a church or on national television for real one time and for the rest of your life you would cash in those sweet Jesus bucks.
---
OMG, leveling my warrior was the most painful experience ever. So much downtime eating, no way to escape bad situations like may other classes escape abilities.
---
But...at 60 when everyone wants to farm 5 mans, you are the most needed if you're willing to tank. For raids, you're back to not quite being on the list of demand because most guilds have their MT/OT picked out and showing up consistently otherwise they wouldn't be the tank.  
---
PvP - absolutely sucks without a healer, and absolutely ROCK with a healer. There's not much in between.
---
Which is why exactly zero vanilla private servers exist, right?
---
Psychic Scream - just make a freaky yell and make everyone around me run around like chickens with their heads cut off.
---
They have Cartoon Network fusion fall private servers too....what’s your point. Like I said, some people enjoy their aids.
---
Nope, armor meant a lot more back then so pallys where better for warriors rogues but...priest is better against casters, it's just a tradeoff.  You need peels against melee and hunters on a priest, it's just something to accept.
---
As far as heals, meters suck but if that's how you're being judged that's pretty lame. If so then you need to coordinate with your RL to avoid heal sniping. Heal sniping is real and it's fucking FRUSTRATING.  Seems like I remember using Heal a lot, downranked GH, and only used GH if it was a bad situation. FH spam gets expensive.
---
with "find minerals" you actually get kind of a mind control as well
---
&gt; There are two quests in Vanilla WoW that have actually made me cry: “Deep Ocean, Vast Sea” in Darkshore. You had to go underwater into a sunken ship with massive amounts of murlocs guarding it. You either died to the murlocs or running out of breath. By the time you got to your body the murlocs you killed had respawned. 
---
Just need to make friends with a warlock!  We're friendly, I promise!
---
Yeah. Funnily enough, the Classic community could always use extra members or more committed members for the sake of the game, and if it takes some clickbait thumbnails, I'd be okay with that.
---
Anything to maintain that relevance.
---
You know there is a site for precisely that, right?

If you hate vanilla why are you hanging around and shitposting on a vanilla WoW subreddit?
---
Estragon?
---
Nah, OP is talking about Alas, Andorhal in WPL where you have to kill Araj the Summoner. It doesn’t come from Chromie. Battle for Darrowshire is in EPL. But the final quest in that chain is amazing, with the massive battle, even if it is a complete bitch.
---
That's fair. I have no business claiming that I know for certain what Blizz is really planning, but this does fit a pattern...
---
This isn't 4chan but lol anyway
---
The memes mostly. Also pre-subbed for the shitstorm of “this is NOT vanilla” posts that are bound in release. 
---
Complete with sharding and loot trading. So the younger sister has downs and is missing an arm, but hey it's better than nothing.
---
Nobody knows, but there are some things we can speculate based on. 
---
Blizzard wants to limit the need to use humans (staff) for support services. RP servers by nature require more specialised human support services than a normal realm for reasons like enforcing the roleplay name policy. I would argue there is going to be A LOT more tickets regarding ill-behaving players today than 10 years ago, and RP servers will have naturally greater amount of tickets due to higher standards.
---
Due to RP servers having generally lower population numbers (especially RP-PvP) this could further fuel a decision to drop RP servers this time around.
---
Personally I played RP-PvP in vanilla (Defias represent!) and would love to see it return.
---
Yes this applies to everything and has always applied to everything. It's not like we embraced things that our parents liked either when we were young.
---
A positive note though is that as we grow up we can learn to love things created before us. 
---
&gt; This also works the other way. "Anything that isn't vanilla is trash." Equally emotional and odd.
---
Except, literally nobody says that. People bash on retail WoW because it's a dogshit trash MMORPG. It might be a more convenient game. It might even be a great game. It might be your favourite game. That's all valid, but it's indisputably a dogshit trash MMORPG after ActiBlizzard ripped out the community and RPG elements.
---
If the people bashing on vanilla said "Vanilla is an archaic, clunky throwback to a different generation of gaming that will repel many yet intoxicate others" then you could at least discuss it with them. But even on this subreddit of all places the anti-vanilla crowd is just "vanilla suxxors end of story lol".
---
TL;DR pro-vanilla can discuss retail with nuance, anti-vanilla are rabid jealous zealots.

A young person will automatically dislike most things their parents like but they may grow to love those things when they grow up.
---
An old person rarely understand or like the things kids enjoy and we never will. We no longer have the ability to adapt to change in that way. I'll never understand Fortnite for example. 
---
Yeah, good post. Nothing at 60 is in more demand for 5 mans than a tank.  Healer isn’t even 1/2 of the asks in chat. Nobody asks for hunters, but people do ask for mages.  FWIW

---
If you play a hunter, then you need to be the one to organize the group and not be passive about it. Make friends with tanks, maybe even farm for them to get help getting your prebis groups. Just my 2 cents
---
10% hit, rest spellpower and crit. Than intellect, than stamina.  No need for spirit with mana gems and evocation.
---
I think it's worth mentioning that these kids might actually enjoy Classic if they try it out.
---
We on the other hand are incapable of enjoying the things that kids of today like, things we look down on just as much as they look down on Classic, if not more.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that we're no better, we hate the games kids like. Realizing that it should be easier for us to not throw tantrums, we're two sides of the same coin. 
---
This is EXACTLY correct! Don’t do shadow until 40 then get wand spec back to 45, focus on stacking as much spirit as you can, nothing else matters but a good wand...and know the 5 second rule to frontloaf your damage to about 40% health on a mob then wand it down and keep spirit tap rolling. No downtime!!
---
Ooo taytay is rly gud
---
Getting the smoldering coals from the fire elementals in arathi for your enchanted blood robe. The droprate is god awful. Thanks god you only need two but I must have killed 100+
---
The area is so heavily farmed for elemental fire it's ridiculous. And good forbid it's a pvp server. 
---
Shadow is too good to pass up at 40, but my next 5 points go right back into wand spec for sure 
---
Don't pick alch to drop it later. Get herb + skinning for gold while leveling. Swap one of these to taillering later OR swap skinning to alchemy. You can also go with taillering + enchanting at a later level.
---
In vanilla it takes 3-4 progress bars to mine a node. Making it easy for other people to partially take it. Anonymity of the internet will create a lot of assholes, just be aware of that.
---
Disclaimer: I'm jazzed for vanilla wow
---
I mostly agree with your premise but I'm not sure I 100% agree with the idea that hating vanilla wow necessitates hating all media you were born. I think MMOs are a bit of a unique case in that they are community-driven experiences. Music and movies can be appreciated solo, so there isn't anything preventing you from getting value from them decades after their release. Vanilla wow, on the other hand, doesn't exist anymore. Private servers exist, sure, but the joy of wow was experiencing these things among millions of other players when everything was new and unexplored - an experience that cannot be had anymore with vanilla wow, full stop.
---
That being said, I do think that a lot of the ill-will you're talking about does come from people feeling they missed out on the early days. I also think they may feel that desire for vwow equals a criticsm of the version of the game they're familiar with and enjoy. 
---
Female is a good call as most paladins wear cloth to heal anyway, and if you’re gonna be in a dress....I dunno looks better. Ret would be fun if people weren’t so shitty to non min maxers

Ok, now tell us dishonestly
---
Dont worry mate just got off the phone with Ion and he said they're actually starting at beta patch 0.6 to ensure the ultimate vanilla experience.
---
I learned to tank from a mage who took me to level 60 instances at level 58 because he needed a tank bad. I was happy to listen and learn. I did pretty good on my way to 60, but getting to do scholo and stuff at 58 with 60s explaining exactly what to do was a capstone 
---
Yeah combat was 5 seconds as I remembered it. Imp gouge gave just enough time at 5.5 seconds to leave combat and restealth :)
---
We didn’t decide to play together ahead of time, I just said I was planned on playing a hunter. He said he’d been considering a pally, and then pointed out that a hunter and pally together would be really powerful. That made me wonder what other comps people who WERE planning to play together would use.
---
No, not at all. Mob tagging in world, yes. Instances are for gear and quests only if you care about speed.

Kindly direct yourself to the title of this post.
---
&gt;The "nostalgia" argument is used by younger players who feel a sense of animosity that they are essentially the embodiment of 'late to the party'.
---
I think that's one half of the offenders.
---
The other half are people that didn't like classic, and can't understand why people would essentially want to play an MMORPG (given on the stuff they start hating on). 
---
Damn, I was hoping to go back further into Warcraft 3 loot - my Priest needs a Sobi mask
---
It’s not just that, it’s also a fixation on “progress.” Games have “progressed” and that is considered good *ipso facto*. Modern WoW has dungeon finder so you don’t have to spend the time spamming chat and walking, and even smaller servers can run dungeons easily. Raids require no attunement and can be run by anyone, even the guildless without ever saying a word. It is “accessible” and “inclusive” and other modern buzzwords that are just assumed to be good things. To stand against its design philosophy is therefore to stand against these buzzwords and the attendant way of thinking, and that’s upsetting to many people.
---
Haha. Looks like someone is salty they missed out on the early days. Hell you probably don't even play WoW. GTFO
---
 Not surprising you think taxpayer money should go to public school art/music programs. 😂😂😂
---
I spammed Japanese pop music on Vent while we were raiding. I never did it during serious encounters, but there’s only so many times you can hear “NIGHT OF FIRE” before you start to go insane.
---
I later learned that I almost got kicked from my guild on multiple occasions due to my shitty music spamming. Glad I stopped doing that! Otherwise my classic experience would have been vastly different.
---
I could make the same broad statement about "old" wow players who progressively got less excited by the game, not because of the direction it took, but because their lives and their friends lives couldn't accommodate it anymore. Because wow is a MMO first and foremost, and the most fun you can have while playing it is playing it with your friends. 
---
Or I could say that as the gameplay improved and became more complex, the old dinosaurs became insecure about their own in-game performance - it became much more clear who was actually a good player and who was only good at spamming one button for the longest time without having to go out. 
---
All these statements are wild assumptions, including yours. 
---

Ok that changes everything lol, though I might still try and rebel by putting 2pts in gouge and hope my ping is good enough to let me restealth :)

This is going to be Profession Post #2.  You're getting ahead of me ;)

I was just spitballing numbers.

That is what you call a straw man fallacy. Simply said it is sad they were gone. Who pays for them is irrelevant to the effect of them being gone. Good attempt though, it was a valiant effort lol. 
---
This kills me because the word [nostalgia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgia) is used as some sort of negative. 
---
Nostalgia just means having good feelings about some past thing, it doesn’t mean those good feelings weren’t justified. 
---
Imo that's a great grinding quest. 
---
My first main guild expanded fast toward the end of Vanilla. Casual guild, mostly new players looking to see MC and whatnot in the 6~ months before BC. Roster got up to about 200 at its peak, but largely filled with people bad at the game and uninterested in raiding.
---
Then BC hit and we had to go from 40-Mans where half the people could be AFK to tightly organized 10-Mans for Kara. We had 8 groups going at one point, but no one was making much progress. Officers had their own groups and I was stuck at Romeo and Juliet with mine for the first month — I think only the GMs group also got that far.
---
So after about 6 weeks we had a big officers meeting and it was decided the fat would need to be trimmed. We went down the roster and decided we would gkick most of the guild. Each officer got a couple of vetos to save friends.
---
When it was done, our gm logged in around 4 am and kicked like 150 people. We tried to keep going, but the server-wife drama was too intense. Our GM was getting attacked via whisper and mail non-stop. After about two weeks he quit the game from the mental stress. I tried to keep it going with a spin-off guild, but we didn’t make it too far.
---
Several of us that made up the core still get together most expansions to play together — as we are doing right now — including the old GM. We were all noobs back then and underestimated the social drama when we made that awful decision.
---
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
---
Yeah it’s impossible for someone to play vanilla and see it for the shit show it was. I forgot reddit is a platform of circle jerk and if you disrupt the circle jerk you get came on xD
---
An amusing platform for that reason nonetheless. 
---
Weird, because whenever I make the argument that class balance is much, *much* healthier in the current game, and that class identity was not lost, just transferred from a couple of flavour spells and buffs into the actual mechanics/rotation of the different classes, I get people blatantly refusing to even look at the evidence I point to. 
---
I'm sick of people like you. Those corprate taxes Trump hairold last year was supposed to create jobs. Not allow the greedy motherfuckers who run Activision/Blizzard to buy their own company back all the while giving themselves higher pay raises for "not meeting expectations" which allowed them to fire 800 people who helped them achieve their more profitable year ever.
---
Lol I think I remember doing that but it maybe didn't work consistently. It's probably up to luck that your opponent fumbles his keybinds lol. I'd say go 3 or 0 points depending how important restealthing is to you but who knows, maybe it works in 2019 haha  
---
Most vanilla fans also like BC and WotLK. My personal favorite era of the game overall was BC, but I can see how that was when the degradation started, with balancing around arena, and badge gear beginning the slippery slope toward class homogeneity and free epics for everyone, but back then it was still under control and the game was still immensely fun. The biggest plus of BC over Vanilla for me was the removal of the debuff limit and class rebalance giving a lot more specs time to shine while still having well played pures top meters. The raiding was just sublime.
---
That said, I’ll gladly take Vanilla over whatever the hell WoW is now. I’m done forever with retail.
---
Sharding is only happening at launch to stop massive lag and server crashes 
---
They've said that a bunch. It won't be around after that.  
---
Unlike retail wow you actually got to know people on your server by name. Some people got a bad rep for themselves so wouldn't be accepted into groups
---
Selling them for more per piece - people will buy only what they need for less than an entire stack, and more profitable for the seller.
---
If the devs are looking at this, PLEASE ADD FOOD/WATER TABLES TO CLASSIC.  I think all mages can agree, this should be an exception to the "no changes" ethos.  It literally just reduces the number of things we have to click on during downtime in raids.  It's a quality of life improvement that wouldn't take away from the classic experience at all.  Plz.
---
 
---
#magetables2019
---
Haha your last line got me laughing, I was thinking the same. 25 fury warriors.. so you mean a typical &lt;Progress&gt; raid? They're all rank 14 too XD
---
Great points too
---
Straw man if you think I’m trying to debate with a retard. Just a simple statement, commenting on a retard. 
---
But as someone who isn't a manchild if I don't like something I don't go attacking people who do.
---
Imagine using a straw man against a retard. Pretty retarded it seems. Lol
---
It’s because we have seen what has come before. Over time, as technology grows and movies/games/music along with it. Attention spans decrease over time not because brains are unable to process information over a longer period of time. People found out that it’s more about flashy filler than actual quality content. The kids grow up being exposed to all this new stuff and think it’s all amazing. They simply haven’t experienced anything else. We’ve lived long enough to experience things further back on this trend. It’s not the kids fault. It’s not our fault. It’s the inevitable progression of marketing and technology. It will continue. 
---
Heroic dungeons were incredible in TBC, maybe my favourite part of the game throughout all of WoW history.  They were a great challenge and the rewards were worth it - combined with Kara it felt like a small guild could make some decent progress.
---
If heroics and smaller raids ever become possible in a Vanilla setting I'd be in heaven.
---
Stimulating would be the word I would have used
---
When the first big private server came out I had some friends instantly join it, but I was reluctant myself. I thought retail wow was shit and vanilla would just be Nostalgia. I was very wrong and got hooked instantly and raided BWL until Blizz shut them down.
---
Now I'm on another private server and I've been 60 since maybe mid December, I play very casually and will play a lot more in classic. But I have so much to do holy shit. First running instances for bis Gear, farm Gold for Mount, grind reputations for more items, step into some raids, farm for consumables, level professions, rank in PvP (I want rank 10), world pvp for just fun, do some quests for bis items(green OH is bis until AV exalted... That's so cool), attunements.
---
There's just so much to do and so fun. I thought I would think the rock paper scissors pvp is shit but I prefer it a lot vs the "everyone has an interrupt, a self heal, a gap closer" shit that retail became. Class identity is actually a thing and I love it.and not to mention the feeling of reward after grinding a reputation for two weeks to get that bis item you want... So good. You fucking earned it. You worked for it and you got it.
---
Yeah, I am looking for a guild with no girls or minorities, we gamers hate those things.
---
Well, I'm sorry. But in my defense, when you look through Reddit, you can see something like a thumbnail and this is obviously not a fingernail. You can see the head of the nails easily...
---
Interesting Leveling Tree... would you use that for raiding as well? Or just more of a PVPer once you hit 60?
---
Surprised “community” doesn’t have a bigger spotlight 
---
Nah. Women are fine. It's just people with drama.
---
This quest made me a good hunter. I was 14 and had no idea how to play my class. My guild's class leader took me out to all the demons and walked me through what I'd have to do and how to do it. She transformed a huntard into a passable player. From there I went on to be at least kind of good at my class for years to come!
---
Mind COntrol, obviously.
---
Woah that huge edit tho xD. First argument didn’t go so well did it lololol. 
---
Yes, forcing kids out experiencing  art, music, technical and shop-based classes in favor of many classes that are outdated and  will simply be forgotten by the masses is a shame. 
---
There would be no tanks because no warrior has hit lv 60. The only lv 60s you will see are probably going to be pet classes.
---
My guild was thankfully relatively drama free, but I remember two issues quite clearly, both of which were related to the other.
---
Our MT was an electrician who would work a full time job and then come home to raid. God bless you Tactician you were a real fucking pro and a joy to raid with. When we started to attempt Naxx, a lot of drama was happening because we needed to get so many consumables together to make the raid possible. A lot of people weren't pulling their weight in getting consumables which put further strain on people like Tact who were doing so much with so little and it was felt throughout the guild.
---
Due to BC being announced, we also started to haemorrhage players. As I've said before, the assumption was that another 10 levels would invalidate the gear we would be collecting and, as the raid required such a big time and resource investment, people just said fuck it. The guild drama then revolved around making the decision as to whether to gear up new raiders or just wind down until the expansion. There was also issues as Dethecus was a low pop server which meant finding qualified raiders was difficult.
---
Ultimately, we did MC and BWL raids gearing up new players but the guild ended up exploding and transferring off site. My guildies wanted me to transfer with them, but conveniently, I realized WoW was ruining my life and I wanted to quit due to how addicted I was. I quit about a week after 1.12 and never looked back...
---
UNTIL NOW BAYBEE.
---
I never encountered a trully smart person trying to pull this nostalgia card, and I am not only talking about WoW here. Every single time, they proved to be just complete ignorant idiots or close to.
---
So you don’t want vanilla design philosophy in wow classic? You do know there is a game called battle for Azeroth that you might like.
---
Yes that's how we view things. Go back in time and ask someone 20 years older than we are and I bet they'll say similar things about us when we were kids.
---
I don't think it's as black and white as we percieve it to be but just the external struggle between children and grown ups. 
---
Alfador/Hennath from Stormreaver here. I was in &lt;Forgotten Souls&gt; on my main and &lt;Go level&gt; on my twink paladin.
---
Sometimes you only need one.
---
Neither do I, but some people do. I bet not all kids attack Classic either but some do. 
---
That proves my point to the T. 
---
Fast forward to today where heroics are LFR levels of trivial. 
---
Imagine thinking it was even close to a straw man. You’re just grasping for straws. Sorry your liberal fantasy dreams are being washed away by the GOATUS. 🐐
---
Ya know, I'm not going to argue with you because I don't see anything good coming out of that. I'm just going to point out that my post attacked an idea, your post attacked a person...says a lot about how somebody argues.
---
The nostalgia argument was always pretty dumb, not going to lie.
---
As interesting as I find it that so many people played vanilla at 13, which could count as a "nostalgia age," this does not match my experience in vanilla at all.
---
Most of us were grownups. I was 21. I mean the game required a credit card, a decent PC, and for raiders the ability to stay up to 12AM. A few people were actually parents and needed to afk to drop their kids off at school. Parents outnumbered the actual kids who were playing.
---
I might have nostalgia for 80s-90s cartoons, NES games, Final Fantasy VI, N64 games, Xenogears and FFVII, bands like Radiohead, etc. But I never actually crave them, or when I do re-experience them they usually aren't that great. That's because when we're young we like stupid things.
---
By the time I started playing vanilla my mind had already gone through the meat grinder of life and I was miserable. I don't see how that has anything to do with nostalgia. Vanilla was addictive and amazing and it held up when I played on Nostalrius which was just an illegal neckbeard cover band version of vanilla.
---
Of course the official Blizzard version will be incredible. That will be when the punishment comes for these literal noobs who whine about nostalgia and demand quality of life things which destroyed WoW in the first place.
---
The grind to bronze and the grind to mithril are pretty bad, but other than that it's fine. Just make sure to get every node you can in those chokepoints and don't forget that smithing can give you levels too!
---
lol missed that part, thought it was a skill I could forever use, in that case yeah blind would be a bad choice

That moment when trump has actually put in bills that have restored such programs..... lol this subreddit is DEFINITELY for the memes! XD

Except what you just did had zero nuance and seemed pretty rabid tbh. 
---
Wow! (Pun intended) I’m going to feel very generic saying this, but I loved the Abercrombie quests in Duskwood (The Embalber’s Wife). I don’t even know why - it’s not like the story is amazing, you know from the start he’s up to no good 😅
---
Most hated? Pristine yeti horns in Winterspring. You only need like 3, but the drop chance is uber low.
---
Now, if we include expansions, my all time favorite quest is (I may get the name wrong here) “The Day Deathwing Came” - you talk to a gnome, Dwarf, and an Orc to hear THEIR versions on what happened when Deathwing landed in Badlands.
---
Once we get to Stormwind what do we do? Go farm quests for some copper, then hit up the Pig and Whistle? Maybe take the tram to Ironforge and go to the Stonefire tavern? Hopefully some of my irl talents can be profitable in the Azeroth or else i'll end up like Topper McNabb. 
---
It’s the same thing I hear all the time from Diablo 3 players regarding Diablo 2. These days people completely disregard your opinions if you play an older variant of a game instead of the new. They accuse you of rose-tinted nostalgia glasses and never take a moment to realize there are usually valid reasons for preference of one over the other. 
---
I think the WoW thing is a bit easier. My opinion is that Vanilla WoW is a much better game than retail and it has nothing to do with the trash that is BFA because I’ve had this opinion since Wrath. I hated the way they handled expansions in this series, because it really wasn’t an expansion it was a new game. They overwrote essentially everything of the prior game and created it all anew. I’ve personally always hated quality of life improvements in gaming because the things that made WoW so much fun to me was how much time and effort it took to actually get somewhere and be good. It wasn’t just handed to you like it is today. These days all you have to do is wait for a patch to have the same ilvl as someone who has busted their ass for progression the prior 2 months. I think it’s stupid and why I don’t enjoy playing retail. 
---
Also I absolutely hate that much of the social aspect of the game has been eliminated. During Vanilla you’d become good friends with guilds and people among your server - hell working together with other guilds on your server was actually a thing. Now it’s become more of a single player game in an online world where everyone is doing their own thing, sometimes with a group of others and there doesn’t even have to be a single word exchanged. I don’t get that personally and it defeats the purpose of online gaming to me. 
---
But to each is their own. They can keep saying it’s all nostalgia (as if it’s a bad word) and I’ll keep thinking it’s just a better game (which if you just look at critic score that’s not up for debate). 
---
Eye of Kilrog
---
What? No, no one is for adding that. Even if it can be decided as a clear improvement, the goal of WoW classic is not to make it better, it's too accurately recreate the vanilla experience. Mage tables were never in WoW Classic, so they shouldn't be added. 
---
The thing is, where would that extra point go? Murder 2/2? Ghostly Strike? Neither sound like an amazing advantage over 3/3 gouge
---
They make more than they would selling it in stacks. 
---
Did u read the part of only cast once? One play actor

Classic WoW will have some nostalgia for me too.  But at the same time, I’m excited to play a version that was much harder, more immersive , and just down right fun.  I like retail WoW but Classic isn’t a cake walk

Its Tips, he does whatever he can to try to seem like hes a big "Classic Guy" but constantly gives wrong information. He just wants views on his youtube.
---
Paladin, Priest.
---
Pally goes ret, get Sanctity Aura, friend goes smite Priest, the enhanced holy damage from Crusader Judgement plus Sanctity aura makes it faster than if he was shadow.
---
Yeah I was just going to say, the RP-PVP servers had abysmal populations compared to the RP-PvE servers back in actual Classic.
---
Im sure they will make an RP-PVP option.... but I would advise you to beware.... you might end up on a server that's a ghost town. And as far as I know RP servers don't get merged unless there's another RP server (of the same ruleset) to merge it with.
---
In reality I've raided in 6/6 Sunwell guilds in TBC with a female raid leader and a good majority of women in the raid.  But that was rare because everyone was an adult and married with spouses playing together.  The drama comes from the single young girls looking to giggle sext for gear.  Which there are far more guilds with that plague than the one I was lucky enough to be in.  
---
I disagree with the premise that the only way to recreate the vanilla experience is to make a carbon copy of vanilla.  There are certain things that are necessary to create the "classic WOW erperience, such as no cross-realm activity, no LFG or LFR, no class homogenization, etc.  Small quailty of life improvements like this don't take away from the classic experience, they make it better without taking anything away.
---
Honestly, tell me one reason why spending 5 extra minutes conjuring and handing out food and water adds anything beneficial to the experience other than "that's how it was before."  We need to question WHY classic was great, and not have a blind fanatical devotion to "no changes."
---
Oh, you’re really lost. 
---
Imagine doing Vael in BWL, with a mechanic that guarentees to kill atleast some members of the raid.
---
Nah you’re memes just need more spice my dude
---
No.
---
What an unexpected final sentence - love it! 
---
In Classic, healing has a lot to do with Mana efficiency. At this point in the game, spells have different ranks. The lower than rank, the lower the Mana cost (and sometimes casting speed), but you sacrifice potency. You are essentially going to have 3-4 ranks of each healing spell on your hotbars so that you can use the right rank for what is needed. 
---
Micro managing totems is not that big of a deal. You can easily assume that there will be plenty of Add-on support for them.
---
I've found using Questie that for all of the supposed ridiculously low drop rate quests only certain mobs drop the items and I had been killing similar mobs of different names in nearby areas. If you know which mobs actually drop the items they're speedy quests.

They all have heads but you are such a noob at that level that you keep destroying them with your clumsy strikes and spells. High quality, unharmed heads only bro.

Going deep into aff will probably give me *slightly* higher dps but going into demo will give me 20% more void dmg, plus double improved sacs will make me a wrecking ball in wPvP while levelling.
---
If you want to PVE you will most likely be asked to have Trueshot Aura. So there's no way around putting 31 points into marksmanship tree. Putting 15 points in survival will give you some solid PVP advantages like 10% more health and improved Wing Clip. Overall you will do pretty fine with Marksmanship in PVP though. Scatter shot is a must have skill anyway.

Is this a serious comment? what is up with this sub man? You really think anyone who says something about nostalgia is just a 14 year old who also thinks anything that ever came out before they were born is terrible? How can you make generalizations like that and take yourself seriously? This is some next level insecurity.
---
I love how you failed to answer my question and instead gave me validation on how much it upset you! I would of preferred a yes or no and a why, but this checks the box off of the salt category today :)
---
The Vanilla dungeon finder was objectively worse at getting a good dungeon party than using LFG chat.
---
Stop enjoying games and get with the hate, son.
---
I just know it won't make me feel like I did 14 years ago, I'm a completely different person now and that experience has been...... experienced. I don't know how to put it, I'm sure blizzard will do an ok job with classic, the initial excitement made me want to play it, but after thinking about it for the last few months I don't think I'll bother picking it up this summer
---
Bra. There are some good "changes" to keep the game from being annoying...
---
This isnt one of them. 
---
Nostalgia is a feeling that many experiance now, as they recall sheer amount of good or bad memories. When you entered vanilla WoW again your old, dusted synapses are gonna fire like christmas tree. Does it mean you will feel better? That is totally up to individual and attitude you wish to take. It can be bad, because you probably won't see old friends and guild which will make you sad of passed time, but it also can be good if you let yourself immerse and stand up for upcoming new experiances. 
---
As we can all sense. Nostalgia can bad or good. It all depends on certain individual attitude. I think Nostalgia is vastly depicted as negative mainly, because people are walling themself for new experiances and hold to old times too much.
---
It was way more interesting than Molten Core.
---
Why tho?  I'm open to to changing my mind here.  Why specifically does having to spend extra time during downtime in raids and dungeons add anything to the classic experience? If there's argument here other than "it's a slippery slope," or "that's just the way it was in classic," I'd honestly like to hear it.
---
Please tell you are not a dwarf from Bloodhoof EU? 
---
I work for a data science software company.  Currently no one in my office plays WoW.  We already have 26 people committed to playing Classic and making a guild.  We now have the most active Slack channel in the company talking about what we’re gonna grind and how we’re going to form raid groups.  I think Classic is going to save WoW.  
---
The hunter quest was one of the most satisfying things I've ever completed in this game. I still use the transmog!
---
Imagine if Classic overtake retail in popularity. Some of the retail players are going to have a mental breakdown lol! Can’t wait.
---
that was not a question, you were just trying to frame me by saying i said something which i didnt  
---
goodbye brainlet  
---
In Retail WoW 70% of the guilds are disbanded the to drama. 
---
They didn't make more money, they reported bigger revenue, big difference. They laid off 800 people because they are expecting the income to tank after fucking up with diablo mobile and bfa.
---
Plus most money they make comes from candy crush, not wow.
---
That's called a bank alt, different thing.
---
Depends whatever else you have already. 
---
This is roughly what my assassination build will look like: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0RxtVohfZA0bM
---
I can afford 3/5 MoD and put 2 other points elsewhere as a NE. This is a high gear build though of course, being seal fate.
---
And this is the sub build I'll roughly use: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oxpZhfZAMIMc0o
---
Also relies on some pretty good gear, but not as bad IMO due to so many CD's available.
---
Those are basically the only two specs I go back and forth between depending on my mood. I don't give up 3/3 imp gouge because I never put more than 8 points in combat. If I *were* going to go combat I'd see no problem not having gouge as you're not really a utility rogue anymore, but a powerhouse. So I'd probably do something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxcRxZMhEzrVzx0o which would focus on keeping SnD up and staying on top of your target really wearing them down with white damage mostly. 
---
Take all this with a grain of salt though, it's been years since I played vanilla of course so I don't remember every little thing. I'm certainly missing some stuff here and there :P
---
I've considered it, but my math doesn't pan out. Especially as a human with +5 swords / maces and the recommendation to only fight even level mobs.
---
Important for dual wield, or if fighting +3 mobs for the **7% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)*.4%** formula
---
My spreadsheet math says it's less than a 1% dps increase. I might get it in the 50s cause I don't have much else to put points in, but it's a wash for me.
---
In raiding you only need 1 trueshot aura, so no point in stacking it if you have multiple hunters. Just play what you like to play dont worry about this meta bullshit
---
Right on, that makes sense. Just setting expectations in case you or anyone reading was having their first full playthrough. That's one of the special parts about classic is that it's actually a complete game and even the leveling experience can be considered a full game, not just "game starts at max" like all the other expansions. 3 months in and you'll be level 30 ish having a blast haha
---
&gt;Disagree, it added the god awful token system, adding an unnecessary step to getting gear.
---
Because looting Judgement Legplates number x24 when your Warlocks still need their Tier gear is not unecessary?
---
Yes. Hunters go to pve spec does amazingly well in pvp. 
---
No. Just because this is a game does mean we should allow antisocial sociapaths to have free reign and do whatever the heck they want. If you spend your entire playtime intentionally making the experience as painful as possible for as many other players as you are able, there should absolutely be consequences.
---
Thanksfully Blizzard agrees with this.
---
I'm down with nostalgia. I don't need a reason to enjoy it. Whatever keeps kids like that out is A+ in my book.
---
&gt;once you reach this point good luck getting your ultra geared guildies to help you do it bc they can't be assed either.
---
Have you considered joining a guild where people actually care about working together as a team?
---
True shot aura doesn't apply for the whole raid, it only affects the group you're in. So yeah, every hunter has to have Trueshot aura since there are usually 4 melee groups.
---
Actually most of them might just use their auction house addon wrong. The post function can be tricky at times 😊
---
Shouldnt be around at all, and i dont care what launch week excuses they use to justify it. 
---
On the other hand, there's nothing worse than needing 1,2 or 4 of some item and only having stacks of 20 on the AH.
---
Blizzard has made it clear that they have no intentions to do anything other than fully recreate the classic experience. Meaning, they won't change anything about the original game unless it's something that they didn't originally intend to be in the game (ex: walljumps, exploits, etc.). You can complain and point out that there not being mage tables doesn't make sense all you want, it's just blizzard isn't going to add it. 
---
For the record I agree, having mage tables would definitely be easier to deal with, but, "that's just the way it was in classic", and that's just a feature that wasn't there. 
---
I've played on retail Vanilla and many private servers and it almost always comes down to player retention, slackers who aren't pulling their own weight/bringing pots and loot distribution. It's simply bound to happen the longer the game goes on.
---
Oh no they changed something so it doesn't crash PITCHFORKS UP BOYS LETS GET MAD
---
Why would the bat boss be an issue?
---
I think its similar to many things in classic. Vanilla doesnt give you instant gratification, you need to wait, grind and work for stuff. When you get anything amazing, you can be sure there a lot of time invested behind it. Of course water isnt an epic weapon, but the principle still applies. Even the conjured water is quite valuable in vanilla - many people will play you for giving them 5 stacks of water. They pay you because it doesnt take just 1 click but few dozens of seconds of conjuring. Even in raids, people will like you if you give them enough water constantly and always carry some around, because they know it takes effort from the mage in doing so. Same way you could probably make warlocks gain 10 soulshard from every drain soul because you dont want them to run around for 10 minutes before every raid farming them.
---
In my opinion, there are quality of life changes that the developers should think about - like adding multiple stacks of items in auction house at the same time or picking up all of your mailbox in one click, or better UI improvements etc. Generally stuff that only you interact with. But i wouldnt include stuff like water tables here, because you interact with other players and it takes effort to do your job well. This is the kind of reward vanilla gives you - if you put in time and consistency, not just immediate show of skill, you will be successful withing the game and also within the community.
---
This needs upvotes.
---
YSK someone mining a node you're mining doesn't mean theyre an asshole.
---
for the horde?
---
ok, good point.
---
So youre saying youd rather *not* play for a few days after launch because the servers are full because everyones going to making a level 1 and probably taper off at around 20 but until then there will be so many fucking players. If they didn't shard that would hurt wow classic more since the *hype* for this fucking game is insane. Players are foaming at the mouths to get killed by a defias pillager and not logging on would only hurt new players, diehards like us *would* wait but I want new players aswell an elitist classic server *isnt* a vanilla experience.. itd just be a private server experience.
---
What gear level are we talking? If you can heal through the damage of a Palading tanking in Full T2 with a Thunderfury and Flask of Supreme Power, the retpaladins should never pull aggro.
---

---
It seems as though Dire Maul with be available at launch, so here’s what I’ll be trying to push for around the 2-3 month mark.
---
gotta say, I don't really care about the "incorrect" character for the thumbnail, but to say there isn't any art - surely there's something of Hakkar, he has loads of fan art!
---
I’m rolling a warlock and soulstoning myself on cooldown.
---
Also for Arathi Basin - Mage is used to controll the masses, AoE slow enemy pushes, keep enemies at graveyard and general tanking. Warlock is usually used defensively because of his pet. Even if you CC the warlock, you still cant cap the base because of the pet. Lock also has a lot of survivability.
---
For WSG, warlock is again used defensively, often to guard the ramp entrance to your base. Mages are often used for flag carrying and extracting the flag from enemy base, as well as the group fights in the middle.
---
It ignores vertical height right?  So you could just move around on the surface and tell people where treasure is for a cut.
---
in my mums womb
---
It depends, if you want to play seriously. Mage of the Archmage is a huge upgrade and you wont get into a hardcore guild without it early on, but it is also quite expensive and you can replace it as soon as ZG hits. If you dont chase the realm first clears and play for fun, feel free to skip it :)
---
and them starting a plague that went down in history as an notable/important video game event.
---
In my experience excess testosterone makes for a way worse raiding experience.
---
Concentration Aura.
---
Instant cure to ADD and ability to work in noisy environments without issue.
---
Definitely use a single target frost spec (frostbite etc). The tank wont be able to hold the aggro throughout the leveling if you aoe. 
---
similar trick, someone said something like "holy crap, I didn't know about /camp, it's so cool!" or something in trade chat, anyone who tested it immediately logged out.
---
less of a concern nowadays with SSD's or whatever, but for me at that age it was probably a 5 minute wait to log back in lol
---
I love the lore and story of Linkens "It's a secret to everybody!" chain. But it's like 18 fucking parts long backtracking across the entire world, and the rewards aren't that great. I'll probably be skipping it.

you sound like you are still a prick today, lol.

Zelda questline was my favorite. 
---
Putting some of the 1.11 items into dungeons like UBRS at launch is basically the same as launching Legion with half of the Argus catchup loot available. Would be really tragic.
---
Degradation started with Patch 1.1 when Forsaken were not classified as Undead anymore.
---
Yea saw the j terface of TS3. You can do a lot of groups. Discord has a friendly UI.
---
Deep Ocean Vast Sea was a quest I ran into playing my very first toon, which was a Night Elf Druid back in 2005. Swimming underwater without any buff or abilities and dealing with multiple mobs was more than I could handle, and I ended up dropping the quest.
---
Did you try to understand it? Play it, watch streams, read guides?
---
Do people actually care that much about "comps"? I personally think, that as long as you're not the same class / armor type, everything works.
---
Obviously some people prefer min maxing and I get that.
---
This is actually a terribly reasoned comment and it's pretty sad it is receiving this many upvotes. Do you really think holding classic movies in high regard is incompatible with the position that you only like things because of nostalgia?
---
Was 12 when my uncle introduced me to wow and was stuck in it up until mop, then pretty much quit and checked out new expansions for a short while.
---
The Duskwood chain is one of the best, but maaaan, Mor’ladim walking around that cemetery back in the day was terrifying! You’re out killing mobs for a loot drop and BAM! A 30 elite skeleton was murdering you from behind. 
---
*LFG Mor’ladim*
---
This would be pretty legit, I looked it up. Most things do not have holy resistance (if not all?). With that being said I don't think you would miss many hits or spells
---
You have been flagged away from keyboard. You will be removed from the battleground in 5 minutes. Type /afk to clear.

Then 5 people leave the bg.

Can you link it? 
---
Thanks! Is that ghe cookie cutter build for pvp and pve? Will there be sacrifieces in pvp or pve? 
---
My favorite is the venom quest from the Hinterlands. It's a looongggg quest chain and spanned over both continents and various dungeons, but it was hella fun.
---
Not spicy enough, a little better but it’s not seasoned enough.

You ever been sanded m8? It burns

You know those fond memories of playing in junior? Or kissing a girl in school, or graduating. Just nostalgia. Wasn't as good as you thought

 /facepalm

The fake outrage over this is absolutely disgusting , people are retarded

They made less money then they predicted. Layed off some people in less critical roles. Wow crazy and never happens ever. Companies never fire people.

You don’t take losing well.

Now that one was worse than the last memes....wtf. They need to get spicier each time not fucking bland.

Why's that?

Druid hunter is very good

For those who like to level the slowest possible combo.

Law of large numbers in effect. Yeah an individual occurrence has a lot of variability, but you pick up A LOT of herbs. Over time it'll even out to whatever the built-in frequencies are.

Borrowed 30+g for my lv 40 mount from a guildmate and never paid him back

Yeah well I feel like that’s always the key lol

&gt;GoldenEye? Counterstrike?  They don't even have a battle royal mode!
---
&gt;All these old people games suck and they're just nostalgia. Just wait until all you idiots realize that Classic WoW isn't even good.  I can't even do pet battles or farm transmogs.  I don't even see an achievements tab! I don't understand why Papa Blizzard is even bothering to re-release this old game when they should be making more mounts to farm instead.
---
--Pleb retail player.
---
(Inb4 zoomers)
---
That’s a great point against that comment tbh lol
---
Got recruiting to a hardcore raiding guild simply because I was a druid and there weren't many high level druids on the server for my faction at the time. First MC raid I got two set pieces, because the only other druid already had them. Ended up leaving the guild after I got my full set for another one and giving away all their raiding strategies. 
---
In hindsight it doesn't seem too bad, but I was deemed a traitor. And this was back when the race to kill Rag first was going pretty hard. Also my server had the first Rag kill, except it was on horde side. My guild was third.
---
He’s got one for almost every class
---
Going down *that* road, I would love to have just known how much better the game could have been if it wasn't for the inevitable time crunch.
---
Imagine if undead were still undead. Ret Paladins in PvP would be that much more (conditionally) dangerous. Imagine if Alliance had only access to druids, but Horde had some type of death knight and Troll headhunters (more melee for Windfury!) isntead.
---
The dynamic between the two factions could have been so much more. But it is what it is.
---
I was just using that term, probably a byproduct of too much PvP over the years 😐
---
Above all it’s important to play what you find fun...but you can’t deny that certain classes synergize better with some than others while leveling.
---
Eventually when classes are at 60 it doesn’t matter as much.
---
You can have trueshot aura on and aspect of the hawk at the same time?
---
(Never really played hunters in vanilla)
---
Every specc comes with sacrifices. The one I linked, doesn't have 5 points in efficiency, which could cause some mana troubles here and there during long fights in pve. But since hunter mana in pve isn't such a great issue it is not a big deal. Not having 15% more agility from the survival tree, will result in a lower crit and dodge chance. But as someone else said. The hunter pve specc is doing very well in pvp aswell. 
---
Yes. It has nothing to do with the aspects you use. It's a spell you cast that lasts for 30 minutes.
---
That’s true, although I’m not too worried about the discrepancy to movement speed. 
---
After I said hunter he said pally—I think with the intention of being able to duo a majority of the non-raid content in the game lol.
---
Doesnt every class get hard countered? I thought mages had the least counters.
---
The idea is that sellers can get more gold per stack, by having the indivudal price per item go up - as some people don't need a whole stack, they can buy several individual items which costs less.
---
Win - win.
---
The issue here is that the time it takes to actually list individual items without extensive addons take way the Hell too much effort and slows down any real money making by spending more time futsing around with a negligible amount of monetary gain isntead of actually going out and spending time leveling and grinding.
---
Reminds me of a CGP Grey video where he talks about old ladies counting out pennies to pay for an item, instead of just breaking a dollar -- which actually costs more time and resources overall.
---
[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UT04p5f7U)
---
As it turns out, the goblins were right, *"Time is money"* and the people spending all day listing already super cheap items on the AH individually are actually just wasting their time in terms of actually making money.
---
Oh did I insult your game? I'm sorry I didn't mean to. I'm of an older generation and find it hard to grasp what words offend young people. Truly sorry kid! 
---
I always love when people accuse me of blind nostalgia. Like yeah, the guy who didn't even know WoW existed until well into Cataclysm is nostalgic for Vanilla WoW.
---
Well shit TIL
---
Arent huntees weaker then many classes at 60 due to gear scaling &amp; deadzone?
---
That's the thing though, catch-up does push you out, you constantly need to keep up with current content and if you aren't playing the first 2 weeks of a patch you fall horribly behind and can't do anything untill you catch up, where as in classic there's always someone at around your gearlevel so you can do the shit with them.
---
Hunter is a powerful pvp class. The gear scaling doesn’t become an issue until AQ/Naxx. 
---
Roll a hunter, be a decent player and you will find a guild.
---
Do PVE and PVP on your hunter. It's so so important to get pve gear on a hunter if you want to pvp.
---
In the meantime you can level an alt, that could be your healer or mage. You want this character to be finished around ZG. At that point, make the switcheroo and main your alt. Playing a mage or healer should allow you to raid from prebis and come AQ you will be quite strong.
---
Playtime to 60: 6-8days if you are new and want to go fast. 8-14 if you want to explore level proffesions and do lots of dungeons.
---
Yes but im thinking end game 60 pvp.  So its true
---
Nope.  They start getting weak in PvE at AQ40, but PvP they keep on rocking.
---
A T3 Hunter can literally 2 shot any cloth wearer. 
---
Highest profits in company history is not enough, eh?
---
I was told by many people that mages are a better option for pvp at end game 60. As they are stronger? True?
---
Are mages or hunters better at end game pvp T3?
---
A lit stick of dynamite so you can end your existence after the suffering you endured.
---
No I'm [not](https://www.wowhead.com/item=9644/thermotastic-egg-timer) joking, that's one of your options.
---
Just redid the math.
---
Math being str / ap base rating at every even level, with expected +str gear, with the weapon, seal and judge damage given those numbers etc.
---
Getting precision as first 8 points, then going ret: 1.02% loss (average 1-60) - lower damage 1-26, and 30-38 and then less than 1% increase 40-60 - Getting SoC @ 20 means 20-28 is 10-18% boost during those 8 levels.
---
Ret to 20 - then 8pts to precision - then back down ret might actually be 1.12% more than plain ret.
---
But 1% is practically nothing. So long as you end up deep ret, it's likely a moot point.
---
Mages are better. 
---
TIL: Mining nodes can have names on them.
---
To be fair any version of WoW is better than retail right now. 
---
When u mean higher skill cap do u mean its harder to play good as a mage 
---
Yes, a poor raiding experience, but a successful one.
---
Here's the spec I used for most of Vanilla with some small variations in for the last few points: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZgVohthtI0m0o
---
Number #1 on DPS in the MC, Ony, and some fights in BWL(Nef in particular).  Pretty damn good at PvP.
---
Not sure why a lot of the other hunter builds here don't have Deterrence. Combined with aspect of the monkey it was a great way to get away from hamstringing warriors/cripling poison rogues when scattershot was down.
---
Yes. It takes way more effort to master mage pvp. Hunter is not easy but it’s def more noob friendly. 
---
Do mages are hunters have more counter classes?
---
I have a fairly effective counter tactic to when in that situation, however it depends on instant mail, which Vanilla didn't have.
---
Beside straight-up asking in trade or general (or even yell) that you're looking for 1x whatever, if it's an herb or ore, I would /whisper people in the zones that these materials spawn in. It's more than likely that those players will either have mining or herbalism, and would already have a few of the herbs you need on them.
---
So it's a matter of: "Hey, you got 1x whatever?", "Hey, yeah actually I got 20, you can have 'em all if you want", "Hey that would be amazing, thanks!"
---
It, just, works.
---
Mages farm melee, but struggle against casters. 
---
Hunters shred through casters, but melee can be a problem if you can’t kite. 
---
Would u say a mage or hunter has less counter classes? If i end up in 1v1 situations, wud i survive more with a hunter or mage at 60
---
That's fair enough. Although we're not so sure how it's gonna work for actual classic, the mindset will probably be quite different from vanilla a'd people might level and gear up way faster than before. 
---
Why would I look forward to that. Guild drama is the worst thing that can happen to a guild. 
---
Both are really strong 1v1. I think hunter is better 1v1 early on. But after AQ Mages pull ahead because caster damage spikes like crazy during AQ/Naxx. 
---
After aq/Naxx are mages still caster food
---
You’re an actual moron. Revenue does not equal profit
---
Yes they struggle even more. Warlocks and Shadow Spriests become unkillable in T3/R14 gear. 
---
so are Spriests &amp; warlocks better then mages? In t3/r14
---
As much of a jerk as Steve Jobs was, he ensured that Apple stayed focused on building great products. Blizzard used to be a video game company of a similar caliber.
---
I'm of the belief that capitalism has a weak spot. A company like Activision/Blizzard is so massive that executives can amass small fortunes just by manufacturing the illusion of a rosy picture to investors. Unfortunately, there are a lot of ways to create local, short term optima. Offloading a ton of salaries will usually do the trick. Corporations should be structured in a way that forces executives to balance long term strategy with short term tactics. Unfortunately, it's all to easy for executives to take the easy way out by showing enough short term progress to award themselves a massive personal windfall. The greed of executives must remain aligned with the greed of shareholders and the interests of the consumer for the market to cause improvement.
---
I obviously agree that sometimes, a large company that's grown fat and lazy has to undertake drastic measures in order to see daylight again (like a body causing a fever to kill off an infection), and that we shouldn't look at those measures as being inherently exploitative in nature. But I think we're right to approach Activision/Blizzard's recent changes with a high degree of cynicism and skepticism.
---
I asked for weights not priorities.  Is 1 percent hit hit worth 10 spellpower?  20?  
---
Bottom right
---
&gt;Get hype
---
And
---
&gt;dp
---
Nice.
---
In my experience all guild drama comes from either irl friends or shit players. If the IRL friends are officers, don't join the guild. If the shit players are officers, don't join the guild. If the officers don't do their job about sorting out shit players, the shit players will drag down and kill the guild. Leader/officers should be the most hardcore/knowledgeable players or your guild is going to suck. 
---
If your guild leader brings 5+ hunters to the first raid, leave the guild. If your guild leader or officers count prot warriors and dps warriors as the same as far as raid comp goes, leave the guild. 
---
To avoid drama, one must have suffered through it and understood the causes. 
---
I've never had problems with females, but understand how it could happen. Remember that druid girl with the hand of rag? Hilarious.
---
Warlocks counter Mages but they struggle against melee a lot. 
---
Shadow Priest is the strongest vanilla pvp class period. Nothing beats a R14 Spriest. 
---
So if a roll a spriest i better hope they never add tbc or something cuz spriests are only like that in vanilla right?
---
Have you ever actually played Vanilla and understand how group-buffs work?
---
They’re alright in TBC. 
---
Spriests shine in R14 gear because it gives them more health than a tank. 
---
Ill probably roll a spriest. I hear horde has better racials for pvp, but i can only play alliance, are dwarfs a good pick for spriest pvp?
---
Dwarfs are amazing for pvp. Problem with being an alliance priest is that you’ll have to deal with Undead racial. Which is about 50% of Horde pvpers. 
---
I'm so glad I naturally quit before trial. My guild got to algalon and I just fell out for RL reasons. Sold my account for a good price 
---
I would disagree that what we're seeing here is a weakness of capitalism, and in fact one of its strengths. Organizations have lifecycles, they are born, they grow, and eventually they die. Activision/Blizzard is at this point a bloated behemoth that has for several years know shown an inability to execute and deliver games with quality and vision the way that it did in its younger years. Is it really a short sighted move to extract maximum value now where the alternative is just to let the organization continue to burn cash while it withers away? 
---
Managers like Kotick are vultures, and I mean that in the most positive, ecological sense. By extracting maximal value from terminal organizations, they reduce risk to investors thus helping free up more capitol for investment. 800 highly experienced Blizz employees are now going through some personal turmoil yes, but it was also their responsibility to plan for this eventuality. Those people are now available to join or form newer, more adaptable ventures. And Blizzard itself is now a smaller organization that might be able to function better again without so many people pulling in different directions. Yes it does truly suck for those who lost their jobs, but it's not unique to them or the gaming industry.
---
And what's the alternative to the private sector business lifecycle? Giant public burocracies that grow without limit constrained only by their ability to appropriate more resources?
---
To those asking how much profit is enough, they must remember there isn't an infinite supply of capitol. They must compete for a return on investment. Activision/Blizzards stockholders aren't gamers, they are muni fund managers who have a responsibility to make money on people's retirement accounts. If Blizzard really wanted to be run by gamers/for gamers, they had a choice log ago to reject selling the company or taking it public. 
---
This is IMO the strongest hunter spec for non-raid content hands down:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cE0Gzx0oZtVohtZI0b
---
1. Both your pet and you will be hitting hard.
---
2. you'll have 2 strong talent based interrupts, very useful for both PvP and PvE.
---
3. Points spent in BM means you want good pet control to maximize those, but you'll have more viable options than just your typical DPS pets like cats/owls.
---
Only downside over most MM specs: Not optimal for raiding, because you won't have Trueshot Aura, Surefooted, Ranged Weapon Spec.

I wish the Classes were less DnD and more WC lore inspired in general. I want to play a Blademaster or a Mountain King, not just a generic warrior or rogue, but I suppose most of WoW’s playerbase didn’t actually ever play WC3, and the classes the game launched with were mostly familiar to any RPG player.
---
Fergot. Man. Idk what to roll as an alliance player for pvp then. What wud u reccomend.
---
Agreed - just as a whole, Duskwood was a deliciously scary place, but one thing I hated about Duskwood was the trees - I don’t know if anyone else noticed this, but I like to play with the camera fully zoomed out, but in Duskwood the trees were much lower so if you played zoomed out your camera angle would just be staring at branches. The zone forced me to play more zoomed in...
---
I can’t recommend. It’s really personal preference. I’m most likely going Mage. 
---
Largely a knee jerk reaction, people want to be mad at acti-blizz and this made an easy target.
---
Your an alliance player? U play pvp? What makes u wanna go mage
---
Whatever that awful quest is in STV where you have to kill gorillas for the low drop chance gorilla sinew. I must have killed 40-50 gorillas before I got it the first time. 
---
The Linken’s Sword of Mastery quest line is cool, but I also really like the Zelda series. I never missed it while leveling and I always throw the sword in my bank. 
---
Orcs are the best race for every class they can play purely do to stun resist. It’s absurdly strong.
---
Imagine an SL warlock that doesn’t have to deal with WotF and can ignore rogue/warrior/Paladin/Druid/trinket stuns.
---
This is the build I plan on leveling with
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxGMoZVx0o
---
Points in feral first (to level 23), then the points in resto (to level 34), then the points in balance (to level 47). After that Everything else goes into feral.
---
Haven't tested this at all, but I want to level with insect swarm for low-level PVP. The low-level feral talents though are too good to pass up, though, so I pick those up first.
---
I can see this specc beeing very strong in the early/mid stages of the game during MC and early BWL content. But for very lategame I'm more a fan of 0/21/30. Survivalist and Lightning Reflexes scales insanely well with end game tier.
---
Curse of Doom on your least favourite politican or whatever. Imagine the havoc if it spawns a Doomguard!
---
Or, you know, Resurrection and save it for the death of a loved one. Or Reincarnation on yourself...
---
&gt;so many people played vanilla at 13, which could count as a "nostalgia age,"
---
Vanilla launched when I was 13, I played on and off until BC launched.
---
I dont see vanilla being nostalgic as a bad thing. For me, I never hit level 60, or was able to experience end game. Despite that I still had an amazing experience with the game. I doubt I'll hit level 60 when classic launches, due to other priorities in life. 
---
The game is great, no matter what level your characters are or what your end goals are!
---
Alliance and I will play both pve &amp; pvp. I think Mage is the best vanilla class all things considered.
---
What race are you picking? Or can only humans &amp; undead be mages in vanilla
---
my brother and his friends played Stormreaver Horde as Nerii Merii &amp; Ferii
---
I got a boner from your story. 
---
Gnome is the best race for Mage. 
---
Nostalgia is 100% the primary reason I am going to play Vanilla WoW, and I do believe it will be the predominant reason people play when it comes out.  I consider that nostalgia well earned and deserved though, there is a reason that WoW held such a large place in my life that it is worth being nostalgic over.
---
That being said, what will keep me playing after the initial nostalgia rush will be a great community.  This is, and always will be, what keeps people playing MMOs longer than a normal game.  I've been through WoW's content SO many times (albeit over 10 years ago) I should be bored of it before I ever picked it up, but the dynamics of the community will add something that you can't really account for.
---
Those who try Classic WoW having never played before will find things they like or dislike, just like we did when vanilla WoW was current, but the relationships they forge in game will determine if they will get a level of nostalgia we got when we played WoW for the first time.  With so few games like vanilla WoW now, it is sure to appeal to some of this generations player who would have adopted a game like this.
---
The thing that makes OSRS different from every single MMO is that ALL content in OSRS is voted on. If it passes a poll then it gets added in game. If not it does not get developed.
---
Is it that much of a hinderance if i roll a human
---
For pvp yes. Escape artist is huge. 
---
All of the players use to playing barbie dress up etc would vote on the dumbest shit and would end up ruining the integrity of the game. Half of the playerbase can't be trusted with such decisions
---
My guild disbanded when I was on holiday for two weeks. They decided to merge with one of the top two guilds and decided I was not worth a spot. My last kill with them was Twin Emporers.
---
Managed to join the other top two guild and got Horde first C’thun with them. Quit WoW shortly after because my ‘friends’ were no longer my guildies.
---
It’s been so long and yet it saddens me to this day how this shit went down. I was never truly that mad at them because I liked them but I feld so backstabbed. Quitting WoW was a good decisiob though, so I am grateful for how it all went down. In the end, I quit when My character had reached it’s peak and I take joy in that.
---
I really only want to play human, dwarf, or nelf. Whats my best option for pvp? As far as a class goes.

Only ranged? Hunter or Spriest. 
---
you have a gorrillian ways to handle wotf and with how geared you'll become become on alliance fear becomes a bit of an afterthought 
---
grenade, rocket helm, death coil, drain life fakecast into fear...
---
Hang with the gnomes, reconcile earthly science with gnomish tech.
---
Any class. If theres a better melee option let me know. How badly effected are ally spriests from the undead racial? 
---
This is the Internet. We’re always under attack.
---
&gt;Is there a hunter spec that does perfectly in PvE and PvP?
---
1. [Fresh 60 BM PvE DPS](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#ce0MztxRtVqohx)
---
2. [Non-hit cap PvE spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZVEohxhtIbbV0h)  
---
3. [Standard PvE, hit capped](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#ce0M0LZVAohxhtI)
---
4. [World PvP](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZgVohthZ0xiVkhu)  
---
5. [Premade PvP](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cVcMdg0oZtVohtZ0xm)
---
I'll give a short explanation behind each spec. Before anybody asks, Multi-Shot is part of your standard DPS rotation.
---
1. You have awful gear and so does everybody else. Even though your pet doesn't scale it does decent damage at this stage of the game just because everybody is running around in a mix of blues and greens.
---
2. You're not hit capped and BM has started to fall off. We take Surefooted in the Survival tree to increase our DPS.
---
3. Not much to say. This is the standard DPS spec that you will be playing for a long time.
---
4. This spec is centered around making you difficult to kill. That's why it's better for wPvP than the next spec since you won't always have people there to help you when you get attacked.
---
5. This is all about making you the most annoying to the enemy team that you can possibly be. The spec is meant to help peel off the healers/flag runner and to make yourself as slippery as possible so people won't want to focus you. Can also flag run in a pinch. Tons of fun and very effective for a skilled player.
---
There is such a difference between rose tinted goggles and nostalgia. 
---
A R14 Warrior with a pocket healer is the most fun you can have in vanilla. 
---
I did nearly the same on druid, got to 59 joined a raiding guild, and found out I was gonna be an innervate bot because I had no concept of "meta" and thought I was gonna kitty dps, promptly rerolled warlock
---
This again 
---
Probably 100+ hakkar kills under my belt and never got Zin'Rokh. I had bonereavers so it wouldve been a downgrade but I wanted it none the less.
---
I dont want to have to rely on pocket healers though. Taking into account horde racials, should i go dwarf hunter or dwarf spriest? It seems those are the best options for ally pvp, since i dont want to play a gnome mage. Or am i wrong
---
You can go human Mage if wish and just deal with not having escape artist. 
---
I knew a guy named Eradicator that transfered there

---
Imma just leave this right here :)
---
Most playerbases are casual players, they will vote for QoL shit and I think a game can become too accessable and it devalues the effort of the individual player making the game not feel rewarding
---
In the BM tree, your pet is about as powerful as you, your pet will contribute about 50% of your total damage.
---
Bestial Wrath is a 2 minute cooldown that makes your pet 50% more than you for 18 seconds / 1 fight from level 40 to 60.
---
At 2 kills a minute, that's 1 enhanced kill out of every 4. Bestial wrath is a 6.25% boost to overall damage when macro'd into your pet's initial attack / used on cooldown most efficiently.
---
For a 31 point talent, it's about on par with the best. Shadow form for Spriests is a 15% boost, but with limitations. Mortal Strike is incredible.
---
For 31 point damage spec you could do a lot worse. you could be a paladin and be able to make a humanoid take a nap for 6 seconds.
---
TL;DR: it's more damage, macro it into your /petattack opener.
---
Hit capping as a Hunter is this weird tradeoff because the PvE hit cap is 8.6% which means that if you want to reach hit cap you need to overcap by wearing 9% hit.
---
The downside is that 40% of that final point in hit is completely wasted. When you compare the DPS value of the final 1% hit vs. for instance 1% more crit from gear reaching hit cap is often less effective. Basically, there's usually something better available for any given slot than 0.6% hit.
---
There was a survey just the other day, a full two thirds of this sub (who responded to the poll, at least) were sub-15 when they started playing WoW. The endgame community was probably much more slanted toward the older players.  
---
Oh the irony in that statement.
---
The company WAS profiting. It just didn't meet the projected percentage increase in total profits vs previous quarters. 
---
The point of contention here is that the employees were let go to make stockholders and investors happy reflecting the CEO firing and stock option selloff sparking investor lawsuits over possible insider trading. On top of this, a new CEO was hired with a $15 million signing bonus (before he even had to do any work) ... while 800 employees got canned.
---
If you don't even know the basics of the backstory to this ... why the f$%&amp; are you even replying?
---
Mining is way easier. 
---
Mine the copper you find till lvl 2X.
---
Buy enough copper ore on ah to smelt to 65.
---
Go into the wetland cave till 125.
---
This can be done as low as lvl 20 or late at level 40( no point to wait 40 tough, that would be dumb)
---
Herbalism is kind of time consuming 1-125 but then its easy as you level
---
I mean, you don’t have to read or comment
---
My own limited experience from playing Ret in ZG is that I could pull up to 500 DPS on bosses in much worse gear than you would have on Patchwerk with world buffs and consumables. You certainly can do all the game as ret, although it wont be as good as pure DPS.
---
stormreaver-US, didn't play til tbc but basically grew up there. Alliance NE priest
---
Drop trap before pull so that cd is ready for when trap wears off. Having the same mob trapped more than these 20 secs usually isnt needed though. However, it's really nice to have cd ready in case the shit hits the fan so you can trap another mob (yes you can freeze trap 2 mobs at the same time!)
---
No need to pull aggro off the healer, never be too far away from him so you can just run up and fd/trap right on top of the mob. Use scatter shot to buy time if you are far away.
---
Is anything as good as you thought? I mean that’s the question. Everyone used to be “something” like hearing your football coach say he was a god “back in the day”. Memory is an imperfect vessel. 
---

---
You only really lose out on minor stuff, the pet DPS talents, which only make your pet do marginally better damage, which is already a small part of your DPS. Survivalist is honestly one of the best PvP talents there is.
---
People who don't have an auction addon get sick of scrolling through pages upon pages of 1-stacks and break down and buy them instead of searching for a better bargain.
---
I'd say it was probably better than I thought. Classic surely is looking to be that way. 
---
This is a classic wow sub! Did you get lost!? We're fans of classic. You just came here to shit on it. Now run along.
---
I dont think so. Vanilla players from privates are pretty straight-forward when it comes to their game. In osrs this system has worked for years and the game is doing better than ever.
---
There could be an issue when it comes to who is eligible to vote, since retail players might be interested in seeing classic fail while RS3 players dont really care about osrs. If they allowed only lvl60s to vote that would solve that problem i think.
---
I mean, there is just so way actual vanilla players are going to ruin their own game after seeing what happened to retail wow and after making the decision to switch to classic wow.
---
Fan =/= Circlejerk
---
Here's the story about how I made my guilds GM quit, helped destroyed our raiding core, and rerolled horde.
---
When MC raiding became a thing on my server the GM of my alliance social guild Rise of Honor wanted to raid the MC, but we didn't have the numbers.  We did, however, have a well-geared warrior who wanted to MT with an epic weapon well suited to tanking and a decent healing core but we were just missing DPSers.  So the GM mass recruited tons of players, consumed a couple of smaller guilds, and bought himself a second account with 60 NE warrior so he could be the MT instead of the other warrior who had been gearing up for ages and lots of experience tanking.
---
We utterly sucked in the MC.  Our GM sucked at tanking and all the random people we picked up made the MC harder than it was when we were running it with 25 people.  They aggroed shit we didn't want to pull, go afk randomly, their DPS sucked, failed to do their jobs at every turn, etc.  It was just a nightmare.  We couldn't consistently down the first boss, and we had no chance on magmadar despite having a bunch of raiders who in pugs had downed multiple bosses in the MC and Ony.  When you spam recruit, the average quality of your player goes way down and social cohesion goes to shit.
---
I was a reluctant officer in the guild(I hated leading stuff and had been promoted to officer without being asked during a guild meeting) and I finally I told our GM that he needed to let our OT tank since he was much better at it, had the gear and experience.  I urged the GM to return to playing his hunter and leading the raid or at least switch to OTing raids.  He lost his shit and quit the guild.  I tried to talk him out of it, but he was so offended that I'd been blunt about his tanking.  I was horrified and felt terribly guilty.  I really liked Zigmund and I wanted him to continue to lead both the guild and the raids.
---
This left the guild in a real bind.  We'd never had strong leadership outside the GM, I was more of a technical mix/maxer wow nerd than a someone who could lead people and the other officers were more social than raiders.  They offered me guild leadership but I declined knowing my own limitations.  So we increased the number of officers and put the leader of one of the smaller guild's we'd consumed in charge got back to attempting to raid.  
---
We did much better on the tanking aspects of the MC but the rapid growth and very visible weakness in the guild leadership spiraled into endless drama that hurt the raid attempts.  So about a month after the GM quit, almost all our hardcore raiders and most of our officers left the guild to form a new guild called Redemption.  I felt super torn because most of my friends were in the raiding group and I had just finished leveled a healer alt just to help the guild's out and now I was stuck in a guild with no raiding group.
---
The new guild had immediate success with downing 3 bosses in the MC with a raid of only 30 people.  They eventually talked me into joining with my druid while my mage stayed in my old guild. I tried to have it both ways.  Big mistake.  
---
My old guild's membership viewed this as an act of betrayal even though I hadn't been part of the group who formed the new guild and frankly I can see why they'd see it that way. I eventually quit RoH because my presence was causing drama despite the new GM asking me to stay to help rebuild the raiding core.
---
I never really liked the new hardcore guild.  It was all about the loot, had a weak GM and lots of kids in leadership and everything was about trying to recruit quality players and not having them escape to better guilds after we spent time gearing them up. Lots of paranoia going on.  From time to time I was leveling a horde warrior on another server just to get away from the drama.  Raiding had become a pretty miserable experience for me and I found I was enjoying wow more just derping around as a cow warrior.   I was ganking in redridge by level 18.
---
Even though Redemption was a shitshow, we made steady progress in the MC until we hit Major Domo.  At which point we got stuck for 6 weeks.  Drama spilled over from the guild leadership with everyone attacking everyone else, with the exception of me and the GM trying to calm people down.  We were kind of like the Mongol horde, progression was the only thing keeping us going and when it stopped people left, attacked others, and generally created endless drama.  Finally, I had enough.  
---
I quit redemption and started playing horde full time.  Redemption collapsed and disbanded around the same time.  I found a good casual guild with solid leadership who were just starting out in the MC and had a blast raiding, PvPing and enjoying wow with them.  They tried to make me into an officer/raid leader a couple of times but after my experiences with RoH and Redemption, I didn't ever want to do that again.
---
this sub is filled with people who will ruin the game including OP get your head out of your ass and look around lol 
---
&gt; but vanilla, idk. 
---
You could've just typed this. It's clear that you don't know.
---
Could say the same about you.
---
They better all be engi and have 2 set of cables! You can pass them around since no resser..
---
Sure is a lot of anticipation for this game when retelling of the exact same news given 3 months ago excites everyone.
---
lies
---
Manner of speaking.
---
"Got all the way up to 2342 pretty good for a 15 year old with 3 months experience in MMO's."
---
"What got me so far so fast? Anger lots and lots of neck beard anger."
---
"I dunno why but since I was a kid I have always had the "gift" of being able to spot some one insecurities"
---
Kind of comes across to me like you are bragging about these negative qualities, or trying to make it sound cool/edge, personal opinion of course.
---
The grass is always greener
---
Competition. The stats of the raid such as DPS, HPS, and kill times are all recorded and leaderboards are created. Each week you try to get the highest scores you can. 
---
Stockholm syndrome is so incredibly strong among fanboys.
---
If you genuinely think Ythisens's work wasn't valuable to the company and he deserved to be laid off, then you're a piece of shit. And that's just a visible layoff.
---
Next time you complain about lack of Classic news remember to eat dirt.
---
Even if that is true, isn’t it fun to test your current knowledge and ability to something in the past?
---
Think about it, we’ve all had 10+ years to try different games and hone skills. Now with classic we will get test that against everything else.
---
Tastes change. But at least you get one more dance.
---
&gt;GM has a wife or "girlfriend" in the guild
---
/gquit
---
It's fun for everyone else. Server gossip was a big part of the feeling of actually belonging to a community.
---
&gt; Due to BC being announced, we also started to haemorrhage players.
---
What do you mean by this? Did the TBC expansion start killing guilds or servers or something?
---
Just vote with your wallet if you are mad at this.  In my country people got mad about some bank CEO's getting extra money despite layoffs and other shit going on at the bank (up to record fines for shady stuff)  Enough people terminated their accounts that the Supervisory Board revoked the extra pay and lowered top salaries and bonuses.   They only  listen when their revenues go down

I basicly do that from

Northern hemisphere's summer or southern hemisphere's summer?  It could launch in December and Blizz could say "Well it's summer in Australia, guys!
---
 polymorph turtle.  let's be honest here
---
vocal minorities is all i see
---
Did you jizz your khakis writing that?
---
I'm curious as to how they will plan any form of RP enforcement. Automated report systems take away in game community control of social issues which goes against what many feel is part of Classic.
---
The newer trend in mmos is to slap "RP" on a server with zero enforcement or even no RP option at all and the community creates unofficial RP servers anway. The issue being these are merely suggestions and unless the vast majority of players on the server adhere to the concept, it's a pointless venture and, in the worse of cases, they actually get targeted for additional trolling by some groups (I've seen entire pvp guilds head to RP-PVE servers believing they can easily dominate them, but typically end up just purposely trolling the RP concept).
---
Hopefully any RP realm is packed enough so that it's target audience makes up the majority population and even without any form of administration, the community is mostly onboard.
---
When I got my very first character to 40 I didn't have nearly enough gold for my mount. The guild leader for my guild just happened to be a nice guy and fronted me all the money I needed to get it and the training for it. He wanted me to pay him back and needless to say I never did. Even though he would ask all the time if I have the gold I owe him I would ignore him and eventually went dark and just unsubbed for a while. 
---
I've had somebody call me an asshole for clearing a pack of mobs and looting a chest. Guy then walks up, calls me an asshole for taking the loot I spent CDs for, then just leaves with no explanation. 
---
Why not?
---
Havent really ever had the pleasure to level through maraudon, do you have a video or a guide what and where to farm from level 46? Or some tips possibly?
---
He said leveling not BC arena.
---
Yea, if your guild is planning for Hakkar's head, they are putting ZG on the schedule.
---
I'm still planning Shaman as it's the class I most enjoy playing support with and I love elemental for pvp.
---
I was thinking druid to level with rest xp as my 1st alt ... but I greatly prefer playing an Alliance druid so likely my rest xp Alt will be a Hunter. I plan on parking a hunter at 59 twink BG bracket. This way it's a fun pre-raid gear tier, fully skilled and can still do AV grind (a good 50 twink can take on average 60 geared players pretty well).
---
I love a nelf hunter with cat but I can get by with an Orc hunter as they rock too, especially with surv/mm as my fav build anyway.
---
&gt; When it was done, our gm logged in around 4 am and kicked like 150 people. We tried to keep going, but the server-wide drama was too intense.  
---
This is probably one of the worst ways to shrink a guild possible, so no shit there was drama lol
---
The second go at it is what I've been asking for. Forever. Even wrote a post about it a few days ago, which aligns with the 10 years of exp gained statement.
---
To some it will be worse, to some they will relive what they had, and to me, it will be better than before. I was bad, and now I see my mistakes.
---
If you don't play warrior, then how do you know that they were good warriors?
---
A lot of people decided to leave for different servers, roll new classes or just quit entirely. When the whole MO of a guild is to be elite raiders, and everyone gives up because Naxx is too hard, it definitely had a huge impact.
---
Keep in mind as well that cross server PvP in BG’s also serves to remind people that they would rather just pay the transfer fee and play with their friends rather than against them.
---
Everyone found out that MC, BWL, and even Naxx gear would be replaced by level 68 from regular gear drops. This caused the more casual players who raided mostly for loot to stop raiding. My guild's raiding group basically stopped from lack of interest outside the most hardcore and we went from having 2 40 man groups for stuff like MC, BWL and one single AQ40 group to not having enough people on to run UBRS.  The details on TBC killed raiding on most servers.
---
The month or so before TBC I was in all guild Naxx pug despite barely doing any AQ40 simply because no single guild could find enough players to raid at the highest levels and even then we didn't have a full raid.
---
I care about random Blizzard employees as much as I care about starving African children
---
PVP Server Player Raid !
---
Because it freezes random mobs in place and often forces them to attack non-tank melee. I can’t tell you how many times the tank has been trying to gather all the mobs just for my rogue to take a huge unexpected crit.
---
osrs updates only pass with 3/4 majority, and there are places to vote in major cities
---
I like this possibility, I think it could improve the classic experience just like it has improved osrs
---
There are plenty ways to feel involved in the community without breaking guilds apart or being forced to listen to passive aggressive snides all raid. 
---
From Cata to BfA (a lot of new guilds came this expansion, and I stepped down from raiding for the first time since tbc) I knew every raiding guild on my server (for my faction anyway), and could chat with at least a couple of raiders from each whenever I wanted. In MoP the guild I was in died because of drama, which sucked massively because I lost a ton of friends, but luckily the guilds without drama were nice enough to offer me a spot on their teams. All drama does is make the community more divided and toxic. 
---
I remember when I just started I was kinda put off by quest chains that boil down to 'Okay, go kill 10 Things/Okay, now that you've killed 10 Things, how about you go and kill 15 Palette Swapped Things'. It just felt, I don't know... to game-y? Too disconnected from previous games? Almost every mission in WC3 had some gimmick to it -- there were almost zero 'go kill everything out there' types of missions, so that just felt like a lazy design. 
---
The fact that in Alliance leveling we spend enormous amount of time going around killing humans and dwarves didn't help either. Again, iirc back in WC2, there were only one mission for each campaign that had us fighting the same faction, and that was kind of a big deal for both of them (dealing with Alterac betrayal for the Alliance/hunting Gul'Dan who went AWOL to the tomb of Sargeras for the Horde). Same kind of strife was in WC3 -- we've had purging of Stratholme for the Alliance, civil war in Plaguelands, dealing with Grommash and his fel orcs etc. 
---
And here we have this enormous world in which we fight... some dudes with red bandanas?
---
That's what I thought when I was 16. Obviously, it turned out a bit more complicated than that.
---
For the favourite quests (barring obvious choices like Tirion's questline) I'd go with profession-related quest chains. There's just something satisfying knowing that all these skill points opened some bit of the game that other people may never know was even there after all this time.
---

Well, it seems like they're doing something about ongoing problems and making the company better. Good for them

I guess based on not knowing anything about me and what I wrote you could interpret that way. However the OP. only asked about when you were a dick. Not your whole back story. So let me just say this.
---
As you get older you learn life isn't a game. It's actually a series of games. I was sacrificing my ability to continue to keep playing with others in the future. To win in the now. Basically I threw the series to win a single game by being a rage aholic on people. It got me far fast but I peaked at 2342 in S2. I never got any further then that in later seasons because I had no one to play with.
---
As far as calling being able to spot insecurities a "gift" I put it in quotations for a reason. When you are young and haven't burned any bridges. It's seems like a gift. After all you can bully people and win the game. That being said again when we play that out across time. You are sacrificing the series to win a single game. It's a short sighted and foolish strategy.
---
When I play now I am basically Tea from Yugioh. I am all about friendship is power and that we can do it if we just work together. I can guarantee if I played wow now with the same dedication I would crush 15 year old me in Arena. Maybe not right away but over time I would crush him. 
---
OSRS did a very good job of being conservative at first and waiting until the community actually wanted change to implement change. They also had an immense amount of trust from their playerbase, though.
---
There will definitely be more people in favor of new content in Classic WoW once Naxx has been out for a while, but it will take time for people to feel that way. Same mentality existed in OSRS for a while too.
---
For the record I'm full nochanges/private server lover, but change will almost certainly be necessary for longterm viability. Not at first, though, and certainly not before the community trusts the developer team. No one is going to be in favor of any tampering until we know more about the team working on the product, because tampering could mean anything at this point.
---
That was my plan
---
They are the best. No down time while leveling since Druid will pop out of cat form and cast a heal on warrior every now and then. Faerie fire with warrior damage leveling is very strong. Chasing, escaping, and kiting in world pvp? No problem with hamstring, root, sprint, travel form. There is more but the synergy these two classes have is second to none unless you do shaman warrior on horde. 
---
Those people will quit the game before we hit the point of ever voting for gameplay changing mechanics, tbh. I think the most reasonable "change" that would ever happen would be deep in the game's lifespan (after Naxx is out), and by then the playerbase will be the dedicated players. By this point, people will probably be more receptive to change upon realizing they're effectively out of content, and will have their minds made up on the development team.
---
But like, if we need 75-80% to pass a poll, I can't see there being that many barbie dressup players on Classic at max level when they can just play Retail or FFXIV or something.
---
Holy and prot is more fun - 25/26/0. With reckoning you can 1 shot people and have the healing capabilities of holy. It's also a good spec for tanking 5 man's/ubrs and you bring belssing of sanc to the raid which most paladins will not have 
---
Wow that really sucks. Some people seem to demand that expansions like TBC are released for Classic. Could that kill Vanilla WoW a second time?
---
Guild Drama was something that happened to other guilds.  I am sure we had some, but I was lucky enough to randomly join a guild that was lead by a group of real life friends, that knew each other from games before WoW, and formed a very stable team of guild leader + assistants.  From before MC till TBC it was a nice guild without too much drama going on.  (And we were keen to pick up key raiders from other guilds that did fall apart from internal turmoil , hehe )  
---
We had a nice rivalry going on with the alliance guilds (we were horde)  and the battle for Aq40 Scepter is the best gaming experience I have had in my life.  (we won by a few hours and pissed off most of the server by ringing the gong at 01:00 am because our guild leader had to go to some wedding or funeral or something the next day, and we were afraid the alliance would catch up mif we delayed it until he returned) 
---
&gt; If the IRL friends are officers...
---
This can be a positive thing though.   my guild from 2005 till 2007 was such an example. the officer team were mostly IRL friend that knew each other from games before WoW. they were not corrupt and build up the best Horde guild of the server and we were also the most steady guild. We were competing for server firsts from MC till first bosses of Naxx without much guild drama. 
---
I was not offended, I'm genuinely curious. I'm not that young either, 32 here, nor did I played Fortnite, but I'm sure that it's a great game, it wouldn't be so successful otherwise.
---
I heard some talk that reck doesn't work in classic as it does in private servers
---
It really only effects levelling.
---
Non-progressive loot will pretty much ruin classic and I am 110% sure they will do it because they simply do not give a shit. Go look at the 40dk vs 40 pally video on the wow reddit, there are no NPCs in AV and the game freezes for 3 seconds at a time. The game can't handle AV and blizzard is OK with that. DPS warriors can be AQ ready before entering MC with the catch-up loot. 
---
You dont have to start a new thread without reading previous ones on the same subject either. But here we are.
---
Buddy of mine ran a similar spec for PvP, get yourself Broken tooth or Lipid for your pet and your golden
---
same here.  Most of us switched to PVP, to enjoy the tier 2 , 2,5 and 3 gear we did manage to get so far a bit more.  PVE gear was pretty good in PVP in vanilla and it was nice to learn some pvp moves. (which required more skill than pve, imho, as a human opponent will always be less predictable than a  script)  I learned a lot about my class in AB!
---
I was definitely  40+.. though not sure if 45 or 46 exactly...
---
What the actual fuck.
---
Lets say you go to a node with someone neutral or friendly to you hot on your heels.  What you want to do is, don't use the auto-loot option (if you normally auto-loot, hold shift to not do it this time).  He can't swing when you are swinging or looting.  So you can hold this for as long as you like, using it to either swing at a time he can't predict the node will be open, or simply hold it and he can't mine your node at all.
---
lol, that was a great story.
---
Y u butthurt about existing topics coming up? Just let it go. I know it can be annoying, but not everyone wants to scroll through zounds of posts to ensure what they’re saying hasn’t been said.
---
I also think it’s interesting to see what topics are common.
---
The didn’t hire a new CEO, it was a new CFO. He had worked at the company previously with a good track record(hence why they rehired him) . They didn’t give him 15 million, they gave him a couple million plus stocks worth around 15 million over time, they did this to incentivize him to come work for them because he is good at his job. The company had projections last year for how well they would do in 2018, but they fell quite a bit short, around 9% if I believe. Therefore they are going  to change up their strategy from last year to reach expectations. I mean you’re right that a public company makes decisions to appease the people giving them money, but I don’t really see the problem you’re seeing with it. If you feel they are comoromising their product you can just not give them money and spend your money on the infinite other games.
---
Hi, /u/chs724
---
I think a lot of people on this subreddit are probably pretty young and not representative of wow's community. I started playing when I was about 7 years old but didn't start playing properly (parents didn't let me use the computer for more than an hour per day + sharing it with my siblings + it taking forever to level up back then). I must have first raided around the age of 13 and always felt like the youngest person in my guild while playing through till the age of 17. IIRC when I was raiding HC in a guild most of the players were mid 20s+.
---
Why the fuck would you put 5 points into endurance training for pet hp and not take any of the good pet damage increasing abilities? This looks like it was derived from a really bad level spec, or built by someone who has never played a hunter lol.
---
Priests are pretty mid-tier levelers, actually. Sure, you don't kill shit very fast but if you play optimally you have zero downtime. It's like a reverse-mage.
---
So, if you don’t do exactly what the shareholders want, you are breaking the law an being irresponsible. Because, robots.

One evening I was doing an UBRS run with a pug, lead by a couple of guys from the biggest Horde raiding guild on the server. The run was smooth as butter, and we killed Rend only for the Chromatic Carapace to drop. At the time, clueless as I was, I didn't really know how rare and sought after this item was, but all the mail and plate wearers in the group went nuts, including a mate of mine. They all rolled, and my mate got a 98 and won. He was pretty stoked. 
---
Then, suddenly we saw that another player had been awarded the carapace. The group leader had given it to one of his guild-mates in the group, and just said "Nah, he gets it instead, LOL". The group went ballistic. It broke up immediately, everyone porting back to Org. I logged off shortly afterwards, a bit annoyed about the run being cut short, and sorry for my mate, but otherwise unfased. 
---
When I logged on the next morning, the server was in chaos. News of the ninja-looting had spread like wildfire. The group-leader who gave the carapace to his guildmate was a high ranking officer in the guild, and people had left the raiding guild in droves, not wanting to be associated with ninja looters. This threw the whole Horde raiding scene into chaos, with new guilds springing up overnight formed by the remnants of the dissolving guild. It never recovered, and the guy responsible ended up transferring off the server, since his reputation was shattered. 
---
Mana issues as hunter? FD + Drink makes that basically an impossibility. When I was raiding on my Hunter I skipped your 2 points in Efficiency and Hawk Eye for 5/5 in Improved Hunters Mark. In the end that becomes a matter of personal preference and experience, but I tried both back then, and never felt that Efficiency actually had an impact.  
---
Early on before you got your gear pieced together you will also be better off with 3/3 in Surefooted over 5/5 in Improved Aspect of the Hawk. Misses are the bane of your DPS as hunter. Luckily you cap your hitchance fairly easily, since you don't have to worry about dodges/parries.
---
Im looking forward to new Vanilla Drama stories on Preach's Stream.
---
FD+Drinking is the worst because it means a dps loss. I was doing always pretty fine chugging a mana potion and in some extreme cases popping a demonic rune. But never ever did I use FD/drinking. 
---
Did you mean smelting?
---
On pservers reckoning can be triggered by sitting down and guaranteeing a Crit but that won’t work on classic.

The day the alpha hits it’ll be like a data miners Christmas. This sub and YouTube will be flooded with tons of info.

Then of course the inevitable “hey guys it’s Tips, let me rehash other peoples work for just over ten minutes”

But is it a first edition Black Lotus?
---
No one understands that the record revenue comes from mobile games. Blizzard and PC division are WAY underperforming.

I don't think we could ever spare a debuff slot for Hunter's Mark.

---
I feel druid and druid do get the same druid skills at around the same level, yes.
---
Never had guild drama thankfully. I was in the top raiding guilds for burning crusade and wrath and it was always the lack of content  and that couple month drought that fucked us. Wasn't a big deal for BC it was at the end of it and we had done everything. 
---
Wrath on the other hand was painful. We cleared everything in a month and were sitting there with nothing to do until March. So ya that sucked to see everyone drop off
---
I never even played Classic WoW and I think the whole "It's just Nostalgia" thing is stupid
---
Ok i remembered right, thats one reason why i was thinking of making a holy/ret

Yes Ulduar was the turning point. Everything that came after it was a step in the wrong direction if we're talking game systems.

Blizzard: We're still working on Vanilla.

Tips: \*35 minute video\* HEY GUYS, TIPS HERE. WE JUST GOT AMAZING HUGE NEWS FROM BLIZZARD AND I'M HAPPY TO BREAK THEM DOWN TO YOU IN THIS VIDEO.
---
Oh, yeah I tried it when it became popular and I thought it was a real piece of crap.
---
You're missing the point. They easily could have kept all 800 people on payroll. That's never been the issue, Activision Blizzard isn't going under. No company keeps redundant positions on because there's literally no work for them. This already happened in 2012 when the game moved GMs from an in game role to your typical call center support, redundant positions were let go. I would rather they go out and hire 200 new people who are going to be tasked with coding content, building a new engine, or designing game systems than keep on CMs who post on the forums and reddit. 
---
Add-ons can list items individually automatically. Takes like 3 seconds more than just posting the stack.
---
Haha I bet that gets frustrating. Have you dabbled in private servers at all just to see it?
---
&gt;Also, the very idea that corporations ought to have no moral responsibility to employees or the general public is deeply evil.
---
I bet you hate that corporations are considered people, but then expect them to have morals too. Businesses have no moral obligation and they shouldn't, otherwise no one would invest in new businesses and the only wealth would be old money. 
---
Lupos is a myth. It's damage was patched and it doesnt deal shadow damage anymore after taming. Broken Tooth on the other hand kept his 1.0 attack speed and is still the nonplusultra against casters.
---
"Company never bad, company always good. Yay authority."
---
Or instead of spending time and money into developing a toggle switch, they could just not put loot trading in...just a thought
---
Stranglethorn valley?
---
They're firing customer service people. Of course they're gonna rely on automated systems to reduce the customer service load. It's gonna happen, there's no way around it.

"Im immune to emotions like nostalgia. My decisions are always based in superior logic." - the nostalgic fanboys guide to never being honest with yourself.

&gt; I bet you hate that corporations are considered people, but then expect them to have morals too.
---
I'm scratching my head here because I see no logical connection at all between those two ideas. Corporations should behave morally whether or not they are legally "people".
---
&gt; Businesses have no moral obligation and they shouldn't, otherwise no one would invest in new businesses and the only wealth would be old money.
---
The idea that a business's only moral obligation is to the shareholders or owner is in fact a very recent idea, and as I said a deeply evil one. The idea that corporations couldn't exist otherwise is simply historically incorrect.
---
“It’s absolutely insane”
---
We know Loot Trading's coming, Months of outrage hasn't had any effect, and it definitely won't in the future. We can come up with realistic solutions. Both sides win.
---
?
---
It will have a massive effect on PvP when you cannot reliably trigger crits by sitting. Definately not only affecting leveling.
---
There is an easy way around it.  No loot trading, respond to tickets with a no, or dont respond at all.  May be high volume of those tickets to start but it will fall off.
---
It’s so weird. You can see what YouTube content creators talk about and not a day later the general reddit populace regurgitates exactly what they hear on YouTube. 
---
You people need to learn to think for yourselves instead of letting you tubers and twitch streamers tell you what to think and how to feel. 
---
Source on no effect?  I haven't seen anything on it from blizz since they said they were looking at it.
---
Or they could just say this is a classic server.  If you rolled Need for it, then it's yours.  No takies backies,no GMs for loot.
---
They fired like half their CS staff yesterday bro
---
I understand, bro
---
Not excited for guild drama at all.  Guild drama blew apart the only guild I've ever belonged to that I cared about.
---
Not a fan.
---
Thanks for answering for me, lol. It's like people still think that 2019 Activision-~~Blizzard~~ is still 2004 Blizzard. GM support for Classic will almost be non-existent.  Who's going to answer all the loot issue tickets? They have loot trading in plan for a reason. It goes against Vanilla, yes, but we have to evolve from denial at this point.
---
FUCK LOOT TRADING IN ANY FORM!
---
That would make ninja looters invincible. Stealing every item without consequence even though people have tons of evidence.
---
As long as it defaults to off, this sounds reasonable to me.
---
On the day I let my subscription lapse for the first time since the middle of Cataclysm... it’s my fault - lol.
---
Trust me. Any true vanilla fan would say no to Loot Trading, but this is as close as we can get to 'getting rid of it'.
---
It's either a workaround like this, or having it in the game entirely.
---
Yeah even in Vanilla live GMs wouldn't remove loot from ninja looters. Both parties had to agree that said loot ended up in the wrong place. This is a non-issue.
---
That's funny. You're funny. Go tell that to the 800+ people that were laid off earlier this week.
---
Get over it 
---
This explanation is used for every of these quests and I have yet to see an idiot who destroys all 4 hooves of zebra while killing it.
---
Implying blizzard will even consider your solution lol
---
If they had to add something why not just add an extra confirmation box to looting? "Are you sure you want to Need - [Item]", "Are you sure you want to Master Loot - [Item] to [Player]?"  
---
I don't think anyone would care about that change and it wouldn't affect anything socially. You also could just say "GM's will not intervene on loot issues". You could probably even make it an addon with no changes to the base game.
---
I guess if you had a squirrel-pyroblasting leaderboard people would compete on that too.
---
But I still can't see the appeal of spending hours farming and buffing to compete on a leaderboard like that. I'm not saying you shouldn't, just that I don't.
---
If it's farm content I need to farm to gear up new recruits I want it done fast and efficiently, but I'm not going to spend two hours each week preparing so I can do it in ten minutes less.
---
OP: "Give us Classic Alpha!"
---
Everyone else: "YouTube content creators are shit"
---
Me: O_o
---
Lmao, been playing vanilla wow on private servers for a few years. This community is the most nihilistic and depressed group of people I’ve ever meet! You mother fuckers need some sunlight  
---
They shouldnt have released it so close to naxx. I loved tbc but they could have easily got an extra 9-12 months out of vanilla. I never finished naxx as we also stopped raiding. Only about 5000 people got to actually finish naxx pre tbc.
---
'Asmongold reacts to ...'
---
No! it isn't.
---
WTH led you to that train of thought? Not getting a dev answer? News flash: we haven't had answers on anything since Blizzcon.
---
This line of thinking is dangerous. It's the idea that they are igoring us and doing it anyway because they dont answer. Which is stupid. No details doesn't mean they're doing it, and you shouldn't be more afraid either. ESPECIALLY if that means you compromise ideals to compromise. Like you'd be amazing to haggle with, I'd offer to sell you something and just stay quiet as you nuke your own price. 
---
We have no info yet. THAT'S IT, Nothing more. 
---
We keep stating what we don't want/what we do want and they can do it/not. Thats it. Don't compromise or you risk blizzard doing it because you compromised.
---
Exactly, do what you want and have fun that was the moral of the original game!
---
I posted most of this as a comment above but:
---
No!
---
This line of thinking is dangerous. It's the idea that they are igoring us and doing it anyway because they dont answer. Which is stupid. No details doesn't mean they're doing it, and you shouldn't be more afraid either. ESPECIALLY if that means you compromise ideals.
---
No loot trading. Period. Now can. we stop with these threads... jesus.
---
They tested as 2.0 also. Sorry for the late response.
---
The word nostalgia IS a negative thing though. It’s USED as a positive though. Connotation if you will. 
---
This is what I dont understand. This sense of accomplishment and progression is what MMOs are all about and old WoW did it quite well. So in order to make the game more palatable to a broader audience they snip and snip and snip away at "unnecessary" quirks in the game because they aren't convenient enough. Well now that we are 15 years in and the game and sub count are a shadow of their former self, didnt their plan fail? Havent they  failed at bringing in new players? It doesn't see hard to connect the dots to bring back the game the way it was when sub count was at its highest.
---
It won't if they keep the server on it's own. I.e. if you want to play TBC classic roll a new char on the tbc classic server. Keeping vanilla servers safe.
---
A massive purge? What a dick move. Soubds like you had a zerg guild though.
---
10% in combination with tallents is enough to never miss. After that go for spell power items with crit chance. To get a better understanding of what i mean go to thottbot and search for level 60 items.ĺ
---
Not really. Many of my friends who started raiding MC use the nostalgia argument all the time. I know what you’re saying, but you’re wrong if you think only young people use that argument. 
---
I'm on it boss.

Some crazy drama. It's definitely going to be hard being a GM and working to have guilds stay alive. So much more drama to go around with discord and snapchat. It's a wild west of drama. Political drama.
---
That was a decision made by Activision-Blizzard, not Activision
---
It is sad how often this becomes an issue. I've been in plenty of great guilds in various games where the girls integrated without issue but that seems uncommon compared to how often having girls in the guild causes issues.  
---
Usually it's because cliques form around them if they aren't already a part of one and cliques are almost always a cancer in guilds but sometimes it does feel like many of them are there for the social element of the game and not because they like the game in particular, which is fine but they tend to gravitate to the more successful guilds which often contrast with that casual attitude toward the game.
---
YSK that it's polite to leave the first person to the node alone.

That would make too much sense.

---
Oh I know I agree, I love the combo.
---
i can't stand the people in these threads who are so out of touch with the real world they think getting fired from a job is just a minor issue and that everybody (yes, even the people who worked at blizzard) can just find a new job by walking into any company and going ''i want a job'' and be answered by ''yes here's a job that can pay your extremely high bills have a nice day'' 
---
why is it so hard to just. see them as people. some of you act like all blizzard did was call those employees big ol meanies and not. literally fired them and left them to pick up the pieces
---
GM's wouldn't do jack about ninjas anyway, you just have to name and shame them in org or message their guild about their behaviour.  
---
Ninjas suck but they're managed by the server community, the alternative is much shittier.
---
Blizzard should honestly just put down a rule on day 1 saying something along the lines of: "A GM can't refund an item of any sort no matter the reason". 
---
There's no reason for the loot trading system if Blizzard simply refuses to refund items to players begging them for it.
---
From my experience any couples in guilds inevitably cause drama.
---
it's probably going to be like that last part of your post. obviously ymmv bc its modern wow but in the rp servers i play on now, you cant really get in trouble for a name unless people spam report you and usually never for rp griefing, ect. some people dont rp or use rp names (which is fine) but the majority do and it works out alright
---
Id be hipped, but i slipped on some ice the other day and broke it.

Dude...there are *three* chicken escort quests and if you do them all you get a *permanent* mechanical chicken pet! IIRC the other two are Feralas and Hinterlands. 
---
I'm going to plug good old preacher's youtube channel for this. Preach gaming. He has a whole series of story times dedicates to guild drama and they are hilarious. Do recommend if you get the time to watch them.
---
Are you trying to convince people on this sub not to play classic wow when it comes out? That seems a tall order. Most here (possibly myself included) are hopelessly addicted.
---
Copied my previous comment:
---
&gt; Dude...there are three chicken escort quests and if you do them all you get a permanent mechanical chicken pet! IIRC the other two are Feralas and Hinterlands. Pain in the ass but that was my main pet for years.
---
You can try searching on this site: http://vanillafriends.com/find-friends-na/
---
I understand their "need" to trim the fat from the company as it seems to have stemmed from over hiring in the last few years.
---
What I don't understand is why they fired cm's like Ythisens who in my view are very essential to how a company like blizzard performs.
---
I feel they could have maximised their roles to a degree by making update posts more often and communicating developer progress more often. But I'll admit - I don't know the full picture of what they do. 
---
Some backstory: I was in a guild called High Rollers on Azjol-Nerub as an OT. Small guild, didn't accomplish much to my memory, but generally had a good time. One day while in ZG our guild leader Spurius /gquit mid raid and without warning for most of us. I was young and it was my first raid guild so I took it too personally. Not long after, I /gquit myself and eventually rerolled on a different server entirely.
---
On the old realm forums there was a thread where guilds would post their most recent accomplishment such as downing bosses for the first time or completing a raid. A friend who was still in High Rollers, Goochtastic, mentioned that they participated in a Ragnaros kill, so I took it upon myself to post in that thread that "High Rollers, with the help of (a much better and well known guild), just got their first Ragnaros kill! In your face, Spurius!!"  
---
Well it was actually the other way around. Our guild helped fill in the spots that the other guild needed and their guild was the one who got the Rag kill. A guild member from (better guild), possibly their leader, posted a correction and was, understandably, a bit peeved. Gooch had to make a post of his own saying that I was not even a member of their guild anymore. I edited the post and apologized, but to this day still feel a little heat on my cheeks when I think about it.
---
My 1st vanilla raid guild GM was a toolbag. He broke the guild, so we reformed and brought in our raid lead's wife. In MC, he mislooted the Asuresong Mageblade to his wife, vs the Paladin who was supposed to get it. Arguments lasted through Ragnaros. We wiped at 1%. Our lone DPS Warrior quit raid and Gquit. We Rez'd, buffed and wiped again at 1%. We nutted up and downed Rags, but don't think we ever raided again. Guild had been farming BWL.
---
That takes a lot of courage to admit something like that out loud.
---
It takes incredible maturity from everyone involved, including the females themselves and the majority males as well, for it to go smoothly. Perfectly possible, but asking maturity from so many people is often a big ask.
---
And that’s how they get you. 
---
Huh, TIL! 
---
I hope so. Every single pserver I've played on that progressed to TBC, even with optional character copying (meaning you can keep your char on Vanilla and still transfer a copy), every single one has died. And they died not when TBC was actually released but as soon as it was announced.
---
Wife and I duo exclusively on our mains and only solo on alts.  We also pvp quite a bit, so we're doing a pally(me)+warrior(her) duo.   My alt will be a mage, and hers will be a priest or druid she's still deciding.   
---
Other duos we found that are really strong are priest+warlock, priest+mage, warlock+mage(beware double dps for dungeon groups), priest/druid+warrior, pally+pally (gear competition and ret stigma beware), and any healer+mage.
---
I know people don't like GM with gf/bf as coleader but I feel when they are mature it's a nice feel. Real mom and dad family wholesomeness.
---
Can be stupid if people flirt with GM's gf/wife or she does that though.
---
My wife and I are going to run sham warrior! She’s tanking I’m resto :) can’t wait
