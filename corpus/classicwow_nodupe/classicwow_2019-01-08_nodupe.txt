I mean, that's where the sharding for the early zones for the first week comes in. As much shit as people were giving it, I'm totally fine with it as long as it never leaves the starting zones and is gone after the first couple of weeks.
---
---
---
Ive only been playing private servers which are based on Patch 1.12, i have never played any retail no
---
Thanks for the reply, always looking for tips! 
---
The enemy just has to die while you are channeling it.  You don't have to be the one to deliver the killing blow.
---
So you cant front stab anymore in classic?
---

---
If true I am on board with this as it gives me carpal tunnel 
---
What reveal? What are we waiting on
---
This is a double edge sword because there are equally as many people who would try corpse camping them. Asmongold already said he was not going to play a pvp server because of this, not saying that couldn't change. And I'm 80% sure Soda said he would not stream on a pvp server as well, but sounded like that just meant he would already have his 60 on a pvp server before streaming a pve. 
---
Are turtles any good?  I always liked the idea of having a troll hunter with a turtle
---
I perfected my add-ons on private servers, but I am pretty sure they will all have to be rewritten for classic.
---
Exactly!
---
I understand why Blizz wants to add it but I am still against it. I feel like if they allow this incident, whats stopping them doing it during the AQ event. Building friendships and meeting people is important and the beginner experience should reflect that.
---
I understand it is going to happen, still not happy about it.
---
Yeah, and if it goes beyond the starting zones I'll be extremely pissed. I get the slippery slope possibility, just hoping they don't fuck us with it.
---
Yall are high. Trying to level on release with hundreds of people fighting over quest mobs was some of the funnest times I've ever had in mmos.
---
They need to find a balance. I wouldn't mind a higher server cap then 2500 though I do see peoples points about it getting too crowded. I would like it to be 5k. I want overcrowded but, not insane.
---
All of that being said I would love off peak time battle groups. By that I mean no battle group during peak hours but, on off times maybe have one. I don't mind a pvp que but I remember them jawns being 25 minutes long.
---
i mean nixxiom will prob make cool videos again, so his server would be cool to be on
---
Nice, that does make it easier while the raid is on.
---
hmm, i'd say the biggest reason to follow a streamer would be that you know the other people following this particular streamer like them for aswell, so all those people have something extra in common with you and you will probably get along with them better on average than other servers due to this
---
I meant the physical act of following them around in-game. :) 
---

Back when auto travel was still a UI mod I mapped out all the vendors of the undercity. Even included spinning around in a circle to delay myself in the elevator long enough 
---
In the context I showcased, you will absolutely get banned. Griefing with the purpose of cross faction collusion = ban.
---
Are Russians not on EU servers? I'm a U.S. play and, Russians are by far the worst I have ever seen. I have found Western Europe and, the U.S. are both pretty even. It only gets toxic when you put them together lol. Inevitably someone drops an anti U.S. or anti European sentiment and, shit explodes.  
---
I agree with you. The most eye-opening interview was the recent ClassiCast with Kevin Jordan, one of the original class designers. He said that they left Ret and Prot on the backburner and focused their Paladin revamp on Holy because more people healed as Paladin than anything else. 
---
But hybrids *had* to heal to be desirable in raids. So the devs polished the most popular spec. 
---
Except that problem wouldn’t exist if they hadn’t stubbornly held to the hybrid-tax philosophy.
---
So dumb. 
---
Why would they tho?
---
The other hidden benefit is that people are far worse at pvp on RP servers. If you are big into PVP and, willing to RP. You can be a bit of a wolf among sheep lol.
---
This is so true 
---
I have tried that before, didn't work out, not sure why exactly. Could be that most times I don't really know how long I'm gonna play for before I start.
---
They're extremely tanky but their damage is rather lackluster.
---
Blizz has been clear they don't want to support two different versions of the game. That higher cap server would require changes to fix the many problems associated with overpopulated servers. Now you have to support regular classic and modded classic and find a way to make sure people know the difference before joining servers. 
---
Much easier to just have vanilla, and not try to replicate mistakes made on non blizzlike pirate servers.
---
Well, I'm glad that you had fun on your modded pirate server but that isn't vanilla. We are hoping to get vanilla from blizzard.
---
Russians are not EU and they will get their own servers like in vanilla. 
---
I was actually thinking of doing this with the item_Template file but am lazy :D
---
Hunter\*
---
My favorite hybrid spec was 25/3/23. It gives you the flexibility to throw up pws/renew while maintaining a steady stream of shadow damage. Because if I am going down the holy tree this likely means I am spending most of my time casting flash /greater heals over mind blast/flay. 
---
I just assumed they invaded your servers like the Hun. It's what they do in DOTA anyway.
---
I'm a bit curious if you have a source for the druid stuff. I have been seriously contemplating rolling druid this time around but I'm afraid I won't actually be able to tank for several reasons. The Tier sets aren't made for it and +defense doesn't really exist on leather leaving you crushable/critable. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I don't have a problem healing but downranking one spell and pressing innervate on priests isn't as appealing.
---
I never used it in vanilla, and I've seen conflicting evidence as to whether or not it actually worked in vanilla, so I have no idea. It seems to be a point of discussion because it was changed at least once in vanilla and then changed again in BC according to patch notes, it seems unclear as to whether or not it was intentionally left in or just a bug that blizzard will take out when they release classic.
---
We just have to wait and see, I guess.
---
Good luck solo farming anything in blues. Also, its not exactly easy. 
---
Yes there is a guide here by Taladril. I would HIGHLY recommend it. In the link is a Druid Classic Discord that has lots of theorycrafting. Taladril is the man and I would highly recommend both his interview on Countdown to Classic and his interview with Defcamp &amp; r/Melderon

Top: how I log out and view my character screen.

Bottom: how I play.
---
:(
---
Its probably because **its not entirely true** the caps in vanilla went up to a max of 4k.  You guys claiming 2.5k caps are speaking solely of smaller servers, on the larger servers, mostly the ones that were there from day 1 and got full, they had dynamic caps and they capped at 4k. **Heres the proof:** 
---
https://i.imgur.com/V2EyXAy.png
---
Small servers got 2.5k caps. And I see no reason to emulate the small servers since there wont be as many this time. 4k caps are much healthier for the game. Hell 6k can be supported. If you go with 2.5k caps with this you will be sorry when 60% of your pop turns out to be BFA tourist and you are max level on a server with 800 people on max during primetime and there's no enough raid guilds to accommodate the hours you are free to raid.
---
Fair warning though, to make it viable is going to require a fair amount of time investment, and selling yourself to a guild that would be open to the idea. Playing on a private server atm and there are some guilds who run a feral off tank regularly. It's not common because it requires a bit of work.
---
I will try to help you the best that I can. 
---
* **How is it in 1v1 situations?** 
---
   * Druid is extremely good in 1v1 situations due to his ability to escape and reset the fight. 
---
* **Can I consistently win against other classes if I play better than them?**
---
   * Your toolkit counters Warriors, Rogues, and Mages - which is why you mostly see them against Druids in PvP videos. Priests, Paladins, Shamans, and Warlocks are very tough to beat due to the fact that they can heal, deal quite some damage and are tanky.  Hunters are a skill-match. I will elaborate later on every encounter.
---
* **Can I pull off 1v2 situations?**
---
   * Yes, you can, against Warriors, Rogues, and Mages if they are dull and you have engineering + consumables. You won´t be able to pull 1v2+ mostly. 
---
* **Can I get out of combat easily if I ran into too many players?**
---
   * Yes, you can, this is where Druids shines the most.
---
* **Can I top myself easily when self-healing in a safe space (like behind a wall or tree)**
---
   * Yes, you can but your healing abilities cost tons of mana and your shapeshifting costs a lot of mana. That is the reason why you need to stack intellect as a Druid. If you want to play Feral and go full Strenght, you will be OOM and dead within seconds. If you have good gear, you can have around 5-6k mana and then you can keep the fight up much longer and eventually outsustain your enemy - then you can freely heal in a safe place. 
---
* **Are there any other classes that are severely better in pvp or counter druids?**
---
   * Depends what you mean by "pvp" - duels, world pvp, battlegrounds, etc. Duels are very weird in Vanilla - mostly a player with better skill/gear/engi/consumables wins the fight. If you are talking about a situation where everybody has a full gear, all CDs are up, engi items are ready and everybody has all the consumables, I would say that SL Locks and Shadow Priests are the best 1v1 classes but I will try to be as precise as I can with each encounter.  
---
**- Rogue:** He needs to pop all the cooldowns to be able to win but he has great damage once he gets to you. You will try to keep him away and yes you counter Rogues with Faerie Fire and roots but if you make one mistake, he will kill you within seconds. Don´t forget to keep Abolish Poison on you ALL THE TIME to prevent him from using Blind and stacking up the poisons. You will spend most of your time in Bear Form. Do not forget to keep the Demoralizing shout on all the time as well. That is crucial.   
---
**- Mage:** They are very fun to play against - you put bleeds on them, Moonfire, Insect Swarm and they will pop Ice Block to get rid of them and you can start over. People are saying that you need to shapeshift against mages - and they are right - only one thing - you will go OOM sooner than them. Mage has the ability to restart the fight as you do (in the form of Polymorph) but you counter him with your shapeshifts. You counter his roots as well. If there is a situation that both players have full gear, both have CDs up and all consumables are ready, I wouldn´t know where to put my money. This fight can go either way.  
---
**- Shadow Priest:** This will be trouble and you will need to reset the fight at least once. If you go full frenzy on him, you will lose. His healing from Vampiric Embrace is as strong as your damage. If the priest is smart, he will not try to burst you down but rather wear you off. If I was the priest, I would be using downranked spells as I want to be the guy that can outlast you with the mana. Once you reset the fight after you had to Innervate yourself, I will go crazy on you to drop you to zero asap. If the Shadow Priest is dull he will spend most of his mana to kill you as soon as possible - this way his manapool is halfway through and you are 30% HP - but you can run away, heal up and continue to fight. After a few seconds, he will be wanding you down while you can still pop up Innervate and wear him down. This is why most people suck as Shadow priest - they overestimate their damage and mana-pool. If they are smart, you will have a very hard time.  
---
**- Ele/Resto Shaman:** he is not that easy to beat - he will Purge your Innervate and HoTs. His burst is very dangerous. He can kill you in a matter of seconds if you are not careful. You need to kill his totems with Rank 1 Moonfire or auto attacks. Fortunately, he will go OOM soon. You can outlast him but only if you have a place to hide. If you are fighting in an open space (Gurubashi Arena let´s say) you are dead.   
---
**- Warlock:** You will not kill a fully geared SL Lock in a 1v1 situation. If both players have everything at their disposal and are equally skilled, SL Lock will never lose against a druid. You can stack up the shadow-resistance gear but he will not lose the fight. It is virtually impossible. He will play with a Fellhunter or Voidwalker. He will drain your life for days and Life Tap it away for mana. His damage is surprisingly big but what is the reason he is so strong is due to his 30% damage reduction that is active all the time. Seriously the best 1v1 spec in Vanilla.  
---
**- Retri Paladin or Shockadin:** They are very tough to kill due to their tankiness and Judgement of Wisdom that will replenish their mana. Very long and very boring fight. He won´t kill you and you won´t kill him.  
---
**- Hunters:** very debatable - you can´t let him Scare Beast you and you need to control the surroundings - a good Hunter will be a frickin pain to deal with but fortunately, there will not be that many good hunters as it´s probably the hardest class to master in vanilla PvP.  
---
**- Warriors**: similar to Rogues. You need to keep them away from you. All the time. Grand Marshall Warrior (ok this one is rare) can charge and kill you in 3 swings if you are out of Bear form. If he has a healer, you can do nothing. You can only run. Fortunately, if he is solo, this is an easy fight - Warriors were never meant to be duelers - they will lose against most classes in a 1v1 situation but they wreck people if they have a healer up their ass.   
---
**To sum it up:**
---
As a Druid, you play a support class that is potentially very dangerous in a world pvp - where you can get a drop on unsuspecting players. In BGs, you will be running the flag - if you try to do anything else in WSG, your team will be pissed and rightfully so. It´s the same as if you were playing a healer and try to snipe the respawn camp with your damage abilities or try to duel on the sides of the BG. In AB or AV, you will be defending the flags and you are great at it. You are slippery and you can easily hold the camp for 20+ seconds against 1-2-3 players till your teammates show up. And hopefully, they will. In a team fight, you will be very weak. Your damage is lower than most classes and your healing is inferior to other healers and HoTs can be dispelled. 
---
I wanted to play a Druid in Classic as well but I won´t. I´ve been testing some stuff with druids on private servers and they are not that great in vanilla. A lot of their toolkit that they got in TBC or Wotlk that made them amazing is simply not in the game - other classes are not affected by this as much as druids. 
---
As a Feral druid, you won´t spend much time in cat form - to be precise - you will open on your enemy in cat, put on the bleeds (which deal surprisingly low damage), then you click a Moonfire, insect swarm, pop a bear form and go for auto-attacks with Maul. Once you get low on HP, you can root your enemy, escape with travel form and heal up to reset the fight - as a druid, you control the fight. You can outlast most of your opponents but it takes a lot of time and you can´t get caught out of form which will eventually happen a lot. Shapeshifting costs a lot of mana, your heals cost a lot of mana and your damage output is lower than other classes due to the fact that you are forced to play the hybrid spec - either 29/11/11 which is probably the best 1v1 spec OR HotW+NS spec which is my favorite. You need to be more skilled as a Druid and you need to know what you are doing. 
---
The internets different now buddy. Everyone is most likely to have elvui.
---
Concurrent. I played on a overpopulated server and you could sometimes have 2500 players ahead of you in the queue alone. Logging out was a big sacrifice :)
---
Glad to hear it. Your body language made it seem like you didn't and you went all quiet. It was a very good question to ask when you had the opportunity to talk to parts of the original team.
---
&gt;I think the real question is whether or not there's a number between 2500 and 10k that's optimal
---
ya 2500. Tested and proven
---
Don't give up so easily!
---
Stance dancing was exactly how you survived pvp at low levels. Disarm/Shield Bash, Charge/overpower/rend and Whirlwind/intercept/zerker rage all require you to stance dance. 
---
&gt; But also starting to look a bit more desolate. I'd easily prefer 4k on a PvP server atleast
---
I'm sorry but you're a p server moron. 2500 is anything but desolate. Stop trying to change everything tfor PvP.
---
This wont happen. Screens are bigger/cheaper. Addons are made better. 
---
Well I think that releasing DM in stage 1 is a better idea than in the stage 2. 
---
They have already merged 1.4 patch Honor introduction, 1.5 Battlegrounds, 1.6 BWL and 1.7 ZG patches into a second huge chunk of content, adding DM to that looks like an overkill. 
---
Itemization argument is pretty weak, say that to 1.0 patch HoJ which is one of the best items in the whole game, or 1.0 Lionheart helm which is bis until TBC for most occasions.
---
.....i looked for the movie.....
---
Player pop across all servers should be pretty evened out by the time AQ happens. Also, you have to factor in at this point only the dedicated players will be around. Might get a small pop increase just before the event but the "hype train players" will most likely be all gone.
---
This really explains why so many people are terrible at situational awareness mechanics in raids. 20% of the screen visible with 7 fps.
---
For better or worse, its why I'm refusing to roll any of the hybrids this time around, or at least waiting until my main is fairly geared up.
---
Correct
---
T3 mage tho.... ❄️🔥
---
When your survival spec make you /uninstall
---
Fortunately people like me have a BIS list for every possible content patch #winkyface
---
Oh god... someone really leveled a character named Damagemaker.  
---
That hurts.  
---
No sharding slowed the pace down. I liked that aspect. Now i can Q for a quest chance phases is silly imo. 
---
Actually, all characters run at the same speed. A tauren and gnome will run at the same speed, for a silly looking example.
---
... On the other hand, I'll admit I always *felt* like my tauren was a slow moving brute compared to gnomes, so I suppose the draenei probably would feel the same, even though it's identical.
---
Thats cool, but do you guys really not worry about the differences to 2004? The pop was skyrocketing from day 1. It was safe to assume those realms would sustain their 2500-4000 people or grow.
---
This is the reverse now. We all know and expect new WOW servers or expansions will be HUGE to begin with then lose the tourist over time. Thats a unique situation that we didnt have in 2004. I feel like failing to account for that is making a huge unforced error that everyone sees coming. Going to end up with a lot of servers with 800 people peaks.
---
A super full server can be worked out or around. But a literal empty server that has trouble even forming more than one major raiding guild is a lasting problem that creates significant trouble down the line (server merges).
---
I died to the elevator boss before I found the entrance XD
---
have mining and spam DME duos
---
Blizzard art &gt; all
---
Cool
---
Sounds nice in theory and terrible in reality. It's a niche play style if you have a good item set like HWL gear or a mixture of melee/spell gear to have a few laughs but that's it. 
---
I don't know about anyone else but If I invested that many points into ele, I will be geared towards crits/spell damage gear and this means I won't be doing much melee action anyway. 
---
&gt;  I can recall about 5 big raiding guilds from my faction in classic.
---
Lets check this. What was your vanilla realm. Lets see how many got into naxx and how many completed it. And the same for CThun.
---
You need to remember, the more people a server has the easier it is to have multiple progression guilds. Alot of vanilla servers suffered in classic due to small caps. Servers like Suramar were  only able to field 1 or 2 guilds tops that even got to Naxx.
---
Or a life gained
---
&gt; Instant grouping 24/7 means you don't have much of an incentive to be a good group member and get to know the good tanks/healers etc. It's almost like the LFD tool...
---
This is a false flag. Even if they allow 10k pops on classic servers you wont have people on 24/7. Nostalrius had this issue because it was a worldwide server serving all countries of the planet at once.
---
There will be more servers for different areas in classic. So making this comparison really only highlights that people misunderstand what happened with Nost.
---
Could you msg me the server? I just started playing on a pserver and I'm fighting for quests spawn already. 
---
What's going on in goldshire?
---
Ah yes the good 'ol days.
---
That ui is a bit extreme for me, but i'm sure this one heals, where i was just a vending machine, laying on the ground for most encounters.
---
I know exactly what you mean.
---
The breastplate of valor eluded me for a _long_ time. I got desperate for it! I was running UBRS a few times a day, eventually. I ran UBRS often enough that the epic [Chromatic Carapace](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12871) was mine several times over before I won a roll for the Valor chest from Drakkisath.
---
Valor was never really the gear a tank needed, but dammit, I wanted it, and I wanted a full set, so getting that breastplate was a glorious day indeed.
---
Holy shit
---
2500 people in the same time zone is far from desolate. 2500 on a pserver feels empty cause they're spread out over the whole damned planet.
---

&gt; P-Server with non-blizzlike population: Me and a friend go into a scourge base. It's already full of players farming and there are hardly any mobs around. Getting to the elite mob is no problem at all. The elite is dead, there are 3 people waiting for the respawn. We type "Inv" into /say, get invited. We wait until the mob spawns. We kill him in no time. One guy says thanks, everyone immediately leaves the group and we head to our next quest. Not epic. Not rewarding.
---
If Classic ends up like that, I definitely won't be playing long.
---
Not much that can be done about this outside of getting phased to a different server which is likely to happen anyway. 
---
Why?
---
There were 4k servers in vanilla, also tested and proven.
---
You are the moron, actually there were 4k servers like he said in classic actually. You may have known that if you were there. Now you look like a fool trying to call him out when he said nothing wrong.
---
&gt; There's a rise in 'simplistic' addons.
---
I just came
---
Launch day is the best time to play for hilarity to ensue. Personally i can tell you I won't be the first hand full of players to 60 but it doesn't mean I still can't have fun. 
---
Thats why i havent commited to setting it up now
---
You underestimate the average user
---
I love theory crafting and I hate cookie cutter stuff, but I personally would want the extra 25% shadow damage and 15% damage reduction rather than less pushback on heals. 
---
I'm genuinely looking forward to the PvP montage videos in proper widescreen formats this time around. Complete with pumping edgy rock or house music. 
---
10k may be a bit high, but 6k would be fine. There were 4k servers in vanilla. The extra 2k is just to absorb the tourists that will basically be trying classic and leaving after they cant get a mount at level 20. **We need to accomodate for that, failing to plan for the mass exodus we all know is coming when the tourists leave these servers would be a really stupid unforced error**..... Just saying..
---
One of the best posts of WOW forums ever. Thanks for reminding me.
---
HodortheGreat the 208 Riddle Master solves another mystery! 
---
And now you need to account for the massive number of people that will leave the server after trying it out and figuring out classic isnt for them. Now where will your pop be at if you now account for a 4k cap, plus tourists leaving, plus regional differences???
---
&gt; For me viable is in the range of 80% of optimal so if a hybrid clas does 80% of the damage of an optimal dps it is viable.
---
Why 80%? That number seems subjective, whereas I understand "viable" to mean, "the minimum necessary to achieve a positive outcome."
---
Really, though, this is just me nitpicking semantics. I think what you're saying is, "when a DPS spec can't bring _at least_ 80% of the total damage contribution of an optimal DPS spec, I draw the line." This suggests to me that you'd look for a more competitive raid group, and it seems eminently reasonable, so long as you recognize every guild can decide to draw their line somewhere else.
---
On one hand, I enjoyed playing Ret in Vanilla, despite being a healbot in raids. On the other hand I am not doing it again in Classic.
---
I can hear the sounds of the bridge already. Thank you TNG, for a lifetime of background TV. 
---
Every inch of this is fucked 
---
Yeah I agree.. Even if it pisses people off, It creates character. provides a bit of struggle, improves your thought processes, sorts out the selfish from the selfless... ect.
---
like sunset isle.. when both factions met to do the same quests on 1 tiny island.. I remember a heap of us spread out waiting to tag a mob as soon as it appeared.... what do I remember about anything after Cata? nothing, everything is just "generic" now.
---
But it looks like the sooks want to go sharding so "they don't miss out".
---
This will bring on the Burn out effect I read about... "The start will be over populated, but a month later only the hard core will remain, but this will be boring for them so when the pro's swoop through clean up and leave... Classic will be dead."
---
They must keep it hard, lacking in progression, force people to team up for mini bosses, and help out each other in order to progress at all.  
---
We don't love what is easy.
---
Lol, that's a useless comment.
---
It's in the way it's presented. The ideas don't feel integrated into the world. Even the Tauren feel natural to Azeroth, while the Pandaren feel like they're from a different game.
---
Excellent, there's tons of useful data in here that you cannot find on an online item db.
---
Addons have definitely gotten better, but any time you have that little screen real estate it's a PICNIC issue, and druid is no excuse.
---
So many buttons suggests they don't know what's important. Showing party status four times(excluding meters) leads to poor visual focus and the inefficient UI settings for each addon take more space than necessary and are wastefully redundant.
---
I keep hearing this, oh if they do it in the start, they’ll do it at AQ event. The only reason they are sharding early is because of the tourists. They won’t make it long, or to the AQ event. 
---
You must be smart enough to recognize a simple example out of the top of one's head for what it is, so don't go twisting this around.
---
I agree 100%. Also, changing spawn timers doesn't fix it, because if mobs spawn too quickly, then you can't do the content that was supposed to be soloable anymore, because the first enemy respawns before you kill the second one and move on. 
---
Dell Inspiron 15 is a decent laptop that starts at $850 USD. Base spec plays retail on settings 7 at a solid 60fps. Settings 10 at 40-60fps depending on how busy the area.
---
If you're flexible and can afford the extra $100, an excellent choice. (Source: Have been gaming on one for the last year.)
---
Why are you quoting a server that was never released?
---
"I agree that we shouldn't change the game except these couple of the changes that I want."
---
Top quality post.
---
Thats a beautiful story. Not because its amazing, but its honest, and relatable. I can't remember anything post Wrath thats anecdotal-ly worthy. 
---
This is the weird thing about the game. When you stop going to places you like as much because they're inconvenient. Thank god the Exodar is hideous AND super far out of the way.
---
On retail I only need 3 addons: weakauras, bigwigs, details. 
---
Not looking forward all that much to having to remake half the ui in classic :(
---
Then..... who's the Starscream?
---
Communication is key. Talk to your wife and set up a plan to cover all the bases.
---
 My plan is to set aside a couple of nights a week that are WoW nights for me, and select a couple others to be Netflix nights with the wife. Weekends are for a mix of family time and WoW time, depending on what we've got going on.
---
I know I won't be able to afford the 30-40 hours a week I was putting into WoW at launch at this point in time, but I don't really want to. I want to enjoy leveling and actually read the quests. I'm going to skip most of (or maybe all) the add-ons that let me tune out and just zombie run quests. 
---
Bro you can re-sub to current wow RIGHT NOW and experience a world that is both virtual AND empty.

Bruh.

Damn those tree eating bovine hoards! Always eating all the trees!

On the servers I played on it was like..... half as populated as Orgrimmar. Not that you could tell because it wasn't open, but there were always people running around.
---
Now..... TB and Silvermoon City...... meh.
---
Wow...
---

---
I had the strategy guide that Electronics Boutique sold with the game. I remember reading about Paladins and their combat skills, like Crusader Strike and Hammer of Wrath. I remember reading while installing the game, while downloading the patches, while playing the first 5 levels or so. Oh man it was soo cool.
---
That fucking strategy guide was completely outdated the day the game came out. Paladins were overhauled or something because they didn't even have ret/prot/holy in the guide book. It was like..... combat skills, defensive skills, and holy skills.
---
Yeah I use a 49'' tv as my monitor. I can just fit..... everything and still have a 30'' rectangle in the middle for space.
---
You overestimate the average TV!
---
AKA challenge mode.
---
You strike me as the guy in the Blizzard advertising department they....... didn't...... go with.
---
Paladin PvP gear looks amazing tho 
---
In a raid environment with 3+ Paladins you should be getting Blessings of Might, Salvation, and Kings. Salvation lowers your threat allowing you to output more damage.
---
Having the middle, 30 inches no less, with nothing in it tells me your UI is probably not very useful. It should be centralised. 
---
Probably not idk why people are so worried about streamers.
---
I second this question. I have a cruise coming up in a few weeks time and desperately want to get my hands on this book. I completely forgot to back the Kickstarter campaign before it ended (I’m an idiot), and so I’ve been looking everywhere for a way to either purchase a physical copy of the book or digital copy... I can’t find it anywhere.
---
Does anyone know where I could find a copy of the PDF (or physical copy if it is actually available right now somewhere unbeknownst to me)? I will be purchasing the hard copy once it’s available on Amazon, but I’m just going nuts trying to find a copy before I set sail :(
---
That's what she said...? 
---
Son, your spec is garbage! You're grounded!
---
Right? There should be more forsaken windmills. What's more spooky than a tattered windmill?!
---
So even if the tier sets are garbage for min/maxing I’m still going to shoot for both 8/8 Nightslayer and 8/8 Valor. I’m so tired of seeing arguments about how sh*t of a player you have to be to actually use Tier sets. I don’t care, Tier sets are the pinnacle of Class Identity and any set will be usable regardless.
---
I dread every Warrior going almost full-on Leather. I get it, it’s the best DPS. But there’s something about farming full Valor set and swinging an Arcanite Reaper during the first weeks of MC that feels amazing.
---
I felt like an absolute god sitting around ironforge in full tier 2 with zinhrok, destroyer of worlds. It was one of the only times in my 14+ years of playing this game that i truly had a sense of accomplishment. The only other thing that came close was mage tower challenges and unfortunately I half assed those.
---
Wrath set on male Orc/Tauren and Human looks badass, no joke. Way better than Might and whatever the heck happened in AQ.
---
That'll be five blizzbucks, shills.
---
Druids can solo farm lashers, albeit slower than Mages.
---
The fence just gets in the way of the hippy Tauren vision quests with their slow fall elixirs and such
---
I fell from that elevator when I was creating some havoc as a paladin. I bubbled to not die from the fall and ended up falling through the ground and it set me off swimming across the sky at like 1000% speed. My buddy said he saw me take off like a rocket into the sky. Like 5 trippy minutes later I ended up dead deep in fatigue waters off the northwest coast of darnassus. Great times
---
I agree, with you - I never said mythic raiding was rewarding. 
---
I’m pumped to stop playing modern wow and go back to Classic. My post was to point out the difficulty differences, nothing more.
---
Holy moly this hurts me. (Hunter main since 04)
---
u/Virdiz has been permabanned and their dog kidnapped due to this blatant Rule #8 violation.
---
Okay Michel Scott 
---
I hope they will answer questions related to Blizzards development of classic wow and if they were consulted about how to implement the ''progressive release'' of classic content, because i will admit their server really was the best of all private projects ever. 
---
If the answer to this is no and Blizzard just had a meeting with them way back but now they're shut out of the development process completely, then i see no point in the AMA(personally, I'm sure some people might be interested how they ran the successful private project).
---
Russians didn't have their own servers in vanilla. I think the RU realms were introduced in the second half of 2008. I really hope they get their own realms from the start this time.
---
While the lines were never that long in Vanilla, I absolutely remember this happening, you have to remember a lot of quests had items you had to wait 1, 2, or even 10 minutes for them to re spawn.
---
Or just accept joining a non-competitive guild. There have been many that have expressed being ok with unoptimized builds. Regardless of whether that's viable, there will be a presence for those wanting a certain class fantasy.
---
groups of druids and rogues would ninja to last boss in dm:n all the time on my server back in the day
---
Question in relation to topic... how viable was shaman as 30/0/21 spec for raiding end game content? Thanks for the videos 
---
ono puppy...
---
You can have a profession (mining/herbalism, probably). And there is some money to be made in dungeons. 
---
BM turtle build is not so good then?
---
I had never really played alliance until about 6 months ago on a private server and man, Darnasuss is SO inconvenient. It's such a shame too because it's a beautiful city. O have literally zero experience with Exodar save for raiding it in TBC and WotLK, but Silvermoon is awesome.
---
But that’s what I’m saying. If you join a server early, you will have a HUGE advantage in leveling speed over someone who joins the server later. It makes no sense to join a server late, because of the ganking. Super-high pop is one major reason why “fresh” is such a meme, and why servers die and fail to get a significant influx of new players rolling on it.
---
At least 70-80% of that UI is useless information for a healer.
---
id rather have piercing howl will 40, half those abilities you listed arent coming till your almost there anyways. plus DW is amazing
---
And using inches add measurement instead of resolution.
---
Out of curiosity, what will you be playing?
---
Org and Thunder are so fucking nice.
---
Hey beyond just spec stuff, I'd recommend fishing and cooking.
---
Fishing lets you powerlevel cooking, you can reliably have food that provides some buffs.
---
Besides that, I also think that herb/alch works as well. Having the numerous +hp, regen, str etc. buffs from your elixirs as well as having healing potions makes the leveling experience pretty solid, and gives you something to make money off in the future.
---
That said, blacksmithing/mining has its own roleplay value to it. Certainly less quick and easy to level than herbalch.
---
If it's compatible with Classic, and it should be easy with 7.3 port - ElvUi is a GREAT base.
---
&gt;When I make my new troll (or whatever it happens to be) and I actually do read the quest text is there a real full story to it. 
---
Usually not. It's usually kill/gather X of these. And then some description saying "these enemies are annoying, please help". Not much story with the exception of a few quest chains. 
---
&gt;Will I know why I am moving from one zone to the next? 
---
Most of the time no. You might have some quest that sends you there, you might not. But it's rarely a connected storyline across multiple zones. The human starting zones is the only exception that comes to mind with the defias stuff. 
---
&gt;Is it setup more like each zone is a short story or does it all build to a final plot?
---
There is no final plot. In some zones there is a central story. But most of the time it's just a bunch of random quests and quests chains, some of which have some sort of story to them, but they are usually not connected to each other. 
---
You should not play classic WoW for the story. You can appreciate the story of some quests, but it's not a strong point of the game. Retail WoW is way better in that regard. 
---
Classic WoW is old. It's designed around grinding mobs being the main method of progressing. It innovated a lot in that it had a lot of quests compared to other previous MMOs, but grinding was still in the mind of the WoW developers when they made it. 
---
It is possible to level to 60 without grinding anything. But you will have to jump around zones a lot. If you want to only do quests you can't only go Elwynn -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge -&gt; Duskwood, there's not enough experience in the zones. You will have to take a break in the middle of Westfall and go quest in Loch Modan too, for example. And probably another break in the middle of Duskwood to go to Wetlands. 
---
"But my real concern is what we will do in 247 years when everyone and their great grandchildren have cleared Naxx? We need new content for Classic by December or it will be a failure."
---
Any better than my healer named Bandage?
---
Lmao @people thinking a 15 year old game will draw millions of players. 
---
DM released in first year of Vanilla fuck with Vanilla philosophy. Should blizzard also put back the original stats on every dungeon blues, t1 and t2? 
---
you can view a great deal of it through the web archive. here's from 2003 http://web.archive.org/web/20031001140023/http://www.blizzard.com:80/wow/ 
---
click the captures up top (the black bars) to move through the dates. pretty interesting look.
---
Good idea!
---
A lot of things happened in 1.9 and later that we accept as part of true vanilla, why not soul shard bags?
---
From what I understand a couple of the guys from guys from the Nost team haven’t been in contact, with the rest of the team, since the meeting at Blizz. I don’t think Nano knows what’s going on with that. I could be wrong but I’m like 99% I heard or read that somewhere. 
---
Heart disease
---
ye, kind of an old meme now :)
---
Man, I loved WOTLK. I tanked heroic dungeons and it was great. Then i fell in love with pvp and that was also great. The grind to get bis made me feel like I was actually progressing and getting better. The pvp gear grind is wack now that I think about it. Thats another reason why classic is going to be great. Only bad thing is that I will not be able to play the exact mage spec I want in raids. 
---
I remember the GameFAQs boards back during vanilla was about 80% “how’s my UI?” posts.
---
I cannot remember the guys user name, but there was was one regular poster whose UI was so clean that he would get asked in literally every thread he posted in what his UI was.
---
Good times on those boards.
---
If I can't play this one video game as my only entertainment every day until I die, what's even the point of it existing?
---
What is rule #8?
---
I love how this guy is the top dps from his recount as well.
---
A rule so ridiculously arbitrary and overreaching that we haven't even invented it yet. 
---
I said that this was early 2004 before the closed beta had even begun. Is English not your native language, or am I giving you too much credit?
---
Thats because the player is the only one recount is tracking all the time throigh the BG, others go in and out of range
---
Had the good fortune of bumping into a low twenties priest by the name of Livin in Silverpine Forest not too far to the (undiscovered by me at the time) SFK instance.  I remember pretty much my first impression was that was the most badass name for a healer.  He, like pretty much all lower level non twink, had crap gear comprised of mostly quest rewards like me ... a lowly lock still figuring the game out named Dhark.  I lowkey was pretty proud of my name.  How nobody had taken it that far into the game is still a mystery to me to this day.  It was just before BWL had been launched.  But I see this priest bump into one of those Sons of Arugal punks.  We were grinding the same mobs but it snuck up on him.  I managed to steer clear of em because of the golden portrait and orange level marker could only mean a quick death and long run back but this priest who was only one level higher than I accidentally aggrod one.  I thought about running away to have him fend for himself but I figured what the hell... let’s give a crack at this guy. Not like I hadn’t died before.  I knew at this point a grayed out mob meant I wouldn’t collect loot or exp but I thought I might help this guy out anyways..  or at least show a good gesture.  I had my void out from leveling and he grabbed aggro fairly quickly.  I could tell my VW was not in the same class by any measure so I tried healing it but it was getting burned down much faster than my little red beam.  Then Livin /said “I’ll heal. Kill!”  He must have burned at least half his mana on himself before I got involved so we just barreeeeely squeaked by.  I remember my void had died and he came charging at me and I smacked me down real quick before I popped back up with my soulstone which I had just trained.  It gave me just enough mana to finish him off as Livin was complet OOM and running away since he then had aggro.  After my last shadowbolt landed we both lol at each other ... that was a hell of a fight. I hadn’t figured out any instances at this point so that was the closest thing I knew to a boss fight.  It’s so corny looking back but man at the time it was such a rush.  Like that was it — I was hooked.  This game was dope.  I was on the fence with the subscription thing and all but that’s all it took.  After we drank up he thanked me and complimented my name and I his.  “Dude sick name — warlocks are my favorite class!”  Thus began my first friendship.  I had a thousand questions and he was happy to oblige. We leveled together and he was so knowledgeable. I’ll never forget the time I found out Livin was not his main... for some reason it never dawned on me to ask how he had so much game knowledge but at some point we were getting corpse camped by alliance in STV.  We didn’t always level together but if we were both online we usually parties up.  After the third time getting stomped by this warrior/pally combo he just said “fuck this” and was gone.  Party disbanded.  No brb or I’m going to log for the night.  Just gone.  All alone on my run back. Fuck what did I do??? Man.. I felt bad.. like I wasn’t doing well enough even though this warrior was like 7 levels higher and red.  I considered just logging off because I could see the ally warrior was still there and I was feeling pretty disheartened.  Not more than a minute later I get an invite from  this name I had never seen before — Monster.  This guy.  This fucking guy has a priest name Livin and a lock name Monster.  Ever since I’ve had an affinity for dope names like that.  But anyways this lock logs on and he’s level 60 which is already a big deal.  Apparently he must have been right by org because he’s pretty much flying into stv inside of two minutes.  He pulls up on the zeppelin and we spend the rest of the evening on a pvp rampage.  The dude true to his name is a monster.  He’s feeding me.  He’s letting me get chests in the arena (the OG arena..).  I remember inspecting him.............  see... you have to understand this was back in the day where if you bumped into someone with a few epics they were a god. Shit all blues was dope as fuck.  This guy was full tier 1.  The T1 lock model was just .. it crushed everyone else’s set by far imo in terms of aesthetics.  And something about the highlighted set bonuses just being 100% complete.. hnnggg.. man that was the shit.  From then on out that was the homie.  He taught me how to pvp on my lock.. how to raid.. the etiquette.. how to work AH.. how to level professions.. helped me get my epic mount.  Those were dope times.  Sadly he quit right before TBC — him and the wife had a kid and it was lights out for wow. He said he couldn’t play it casually.  Just didn’t have the heart. I understood. I periodically check in to make sure retail is still garbage every other expansion or so and always try to look him up.  His kid would be ten now and I wonder if he was going to come back.  Even still though those were great times and I was satisfied to have em.  Here’s to you Monster if you are out there.  
---
Sounds terrible
---
If anything, they'll help grow the game, at least initially. 
---
He streams non-content and the majority of his videos are click-baity “asmongold reacts to ...” where he says nothing and just watches a video
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x95kTb9ky8Y
---
You can kite both.
---
No it isnt
---
They're fighting Hodir in Ulduar during Wrath of the Lich King. It's not a BG. If it was a BG, then the druid's DPS would be much lower than 15k, and so would everyone else's.
---
The Recount is only showing the damage done in the current fight VS Hodir, and the 11 players shown on the meters have done roughly 75% of the health the boss is missing. The dps that are 12th and lower are responsible for the remaining 25% of the boss' missing health.
---
Prot warriors complaining about moneymaking when they can just run strat live sellables and make a lot more than the average g/h LOL.
---
This reminds me of people from the 1990s with web browsers that had 100 toolbars and shit from all those damned browser addon things. Ads and shit everywhere with a super small 10x20 inch area where you could actually SEE the fucking website you were on.
---
Imagine being this jealous of items in a video game
---
I loved everything through WotLK and haven't hated everything after. I liked them for different reasons though. Vanilla was this HUGE world I got to explore. TBC was hardcore mode for me. WotLK was, omg, every spec can be played in &gt;95% of situations and be good. The story was also amazing. 
---
Where do I even begin here...
---
Yeah, do this if you enjoy your decent players bailing every other week for real guilds and constantly trying to find tanks and healers. 
---
&gt; Should blizzard also put back the original stats on every dungeon blues, t1 and t2?
---
Yes, that's what progressive itemization means. 1.12 is easy enough as is, we don't need dungeon items to be buffed to hell. Even private servers do progressive itemization because it would make content even easier than it already is.
---
If Blizzard did more significant changes between the tiers of armor (like Mythic compared to anything else), allowing a dye system to exist wouldn't be so problematic. 
---
Yeah I was wrong on this. I thought that was later than it was.
---
Considering Warriors are hands down the best tanks in the game, by a difference larger than the Paladins compared to their peers, and also do Warrior damage its kinda justified that some people feel frustrated about their class spec being bad in that environment
---
Why would I want literal MS Paint squares for a UI?
---
The trick is to play Tauren or Night Elves, in the least populated starting zones. Also, Classic isn't going to be like garbage Nost 14k on one server BS, it will be like actual Vanilla where the server cap was around 3k players. You wont have hundreds upon hundreds of competition in starting zone.
---
15$ bucks a month is nothing considering it’s bundled with a game I’m already playing ;)
---
I’m glad you can’t subscribe to just one, for the sake of the player base
---
You've got all except WW at 30, and 30-40 is the point where being ganked really cuts into your leveling speed. At that point you've already got your basic kit to catch, hamstring, and disable anybody who isn't a frostmage or much better than you.
---
DW really depends on how good your weps are, i know horde can get two amazing 1hs from SM/RFD quests you can get early and there was about a 5 level window where it outperformed 2hs.
---
I had an experience like this on my server. The dedicated players that wanted to progress couldn't because organising 40 people to raid that aren't competitive plus are okay with weaker specs is tough and rare so most would bail onto more dedicated guilds. There's a reason a lot of people didn't even complete tier 2 raids, it took a big investment so weaker specs that require more investment aren't really common and when they exist is that one dude
---
Atleast they have aimed shot.
---
because
---
I did Tauren in one of the latest popular pservers. Even grouping I had to stay sometimes 30+ minutes to kill the damn boar in the staring are and then the damn goblin in that cave, plus every swoop or gathering item was sniped on respawn it felt like
---
3k people will give you hundreds per zone if the server is full
---
Retries are fun in PvP though. Especially AV. Back in Vanilla there was this well geared (Grand Marshal) retri paladin that always fought on the front line. As soon as his HP dropped too much, he just fell back blending in with his Alliance buddies to get topped up, only to engage again and wreak havoc. His k/d ratio was in the top 5 of everyone's.
---
I love the Exodar, but it's a monster to learn to navigate. Everything is the same shade of purple and while it's beautiful, Building A looks the same as Building B and which one is which again? Ahhh forget it, I'm hearting to SW.
---
Not to mention pve tier 2 set, by many considered to be the best looking armor set EVER.
---
I always pick him up for looks and as a leveling buddy. I get all sorts of weird whispers.
---
Even if you don't find that enjoyable, it will only happen once for a relatively short time in Classic, and it's an experience you won't forget.
---
Your last paragraph is why they are speaking about sharding in the beginning
---
This is incredible!  
---
One question I have is regarding the quest template file.  I see a column for the item source that starts quests but not one for NPCs or objects that start quests. Where could I find these?
---
Well hold on, there's still Druid tier 3
---
Ah yes, the banana suit. good times. 
---
No
---
I think they're implying that you should focus on the affixes with spirit in them. Half of your gear while leveling is BoE greens with some animal affix anyway. Boar and whale iirc.
---
That's a fair point actually. Been a long time since i've seen these numbers on actual retail realms due to how the servers have worked since wrath.
---
&gt; I feel like if they allow this incident, whats stopping them doing it during the AQ event.
---
I'd rather be in a shard for that, rather than watching my server crash continuously while I stood in fucking Darnassus where no one ever goes because Silithus was so overpopulated.
---
Let me see the fucking even I contributed a shit ton of mats to the war effort for, god damn it.
---
Too bad a lot of the sets are garbage, it's such a waste.
---
Esfand?
---
As I serious reply, what sold me on Paladin originally was the game guide quote (paraphrasing): "a paladin can survive blows that even a warrior couldn't". It was a more of a defensive class, until later patches and nice 2-handers. 
---
Hasn't sodapoppin consistently played in a pvp server? I feel like he wpvps a lot when he does play open world
---
I went with Echeyakee back in the day. He was like an Albino version of The Rake.
---
So close to viability, yet so far.  
---
Or you could skip the quest...
---
There will be pugs for Ony, ZG, AQ20, and probably Mc. BwL and up may be really annoying with randoms. 
---
That's exactly what happened. Then to fix this Blizzard was offering free transfers off high population servers. 
---
I see it like this, first off someone is having fun doing this then they are playing the game right, but it also is not going to fly for endgame and that's fine if they are happy, they just need to know. 
---
But if we immediately tell people they can only use this talent progression or they are an idiot/noob/etc, then you prove Blizzard right for taking these trees out and giving us the trail of bullshit that led to the current talents which actually make more sense if the point is to simply pick the best stuff for your role.
---
 I think the hardcore players miss that it was our need to maximize everything and making it clear that you either had to keep up or piss off that pushed casual and new players out originally which in turn led to Blizzard dumbing the game down to bring the new players and casuals back. Much easier to understand talents and rotations now than this old system, so even players with average skill and less time put in-game can keep up and do reasonable well in most situations.
---
May not be a popular opinion and I do get this is a joke but we need to sometimes step back and see what mistakes we can avoid this time around.
---
MOP was still a great expansion, class design had never been better.
---
Does he even upload reactions or are you talking about the random channels that do that? He does watch some videos on stream, but I don't recall him uploading that type of content
---
Classic is hardcore if you want to push content. I was in a guild that was mediocre and raid once or twice a week. Pretty casual and we didnt bring lots or flask. Maybe the tank flask but guild bank would pay for it. I dont even remember how we distributed loot but it wasnt dkp. Like a round Robin for the night. Reset each raid I think
---
Shaman. Class of CHAMPIONS
---
You're thinking of the improved drain soul talent- for that it will not proc unless your damage kills the mob.  Can be good to have a macro to have your pet stop attacking. 
---
This already happens lol.
---
Well I've got a boner
---
He doesn't ever upload that content himself, it's always repost channels.
---
It won't be as bad as before because the game mechanics/battles have already been figured out, unless Blizzard decides to change it up.
---
 
---
But in the end it's hard to say. You basically have to figure this out for yourself and with your guild. Some guilds may have a 1-2 hour raid schedules while others will demand a lot more out of you. 
---
Just find a casual enough guild who will eventually raid.
---
I dont use elvui but i see a lot of people using it
---
Yeah do not go on the classic equivalent of Darkspear US or whatever servers they might be. 
---
Granted, it can kind of be a struggle to find a server that seems like it'll remain populated months later, that isn't the home to a bunch of streamers etc.
---
Yet at the same time, sometimes streamers' little community events can be fun? I feel like whatever Esfand rallies his viewers to do would be kind of cool, no?
---
This is such a valuable point that more people need to be aware of going into classic. Especially those who weren’t there the first time around to experience all the experimentation that was available through this system.
---
Slightly being the key word. The real world dps difference between using a swing timer (accounting for slight unavoidable human error) and just spamming SS whenever is something like 3%. It can help you edge out similarly geared rogues on the meter, but it’s not as important as proper CD use, and not energy capping. 
---
I dont see how sharding fixes that if the caps are still low around 2k
---
I played with a lot of addons, but in BfA I tried a pristine addon-less setup and I like it. All I need from UI is the ability to move player and target frame. That's what I'm going to play from now on. Unfortunately there are few addons like boss mods which probably are required nonetheless, I consider that as a necessary evil.
---
Haven't worked with addons in a long time but I'm fairly sure I could whip up a lua script that can reference a target.  Then you can bind a key or some ui element to select the target.
---
Yeah, it's possible, just a lot slower. UBRS, MC, Ony, ZG and AQ20 are all pugged occasionally (or more realistically, half organised by a guild and the other half pugged.) Your chances are better if you join a large social guild (especially if it has a lot of level 60s.)
---
Just don't expect to be able to raid on your own time - it can take over hours to fill even small raids like UBRS, and sometimes the raid collapses before you get enough people. Even if you have a completely free day, if no-one successfully organises a pug raid that day, you don't get to raid. You basically need to just hope that someone, by chance, happens to organise a raid at a time when you have a few hours free, and that raid isn't full of your class/role.
---
TL;DR, if you think that raiding is "the real game" or "the point of the game" or such and you don't have the time to devote to hardcore raiding, Classic probably isn't the game for you. It's possible to raid casually, but unless you have something enjoyable to do during the 90% of your playtime where you AREN'T raiding, you're going to have a bad time.
---
His pushback on pvp is the main reason for the hype to be fair
---
Oh my Christ
---
Excuse me but what is wrong here? This is okebof the cleanest classic UIs I've seen.
---
It seems like most players change their UI for the sake of changing their UI, and they often do more harm than good. If there’s any lesson to be learned from these old screenshots (I say “old”, but you still see bad UIs to this day), it’s that you absolutely can create something worse than the default UI. Bear that in mind before you start fucking with stuff.
---
I'm an na player who's really wanting to play paladin. I'm looking for a guild that's a little less than semi-hardcore. I've never played classic as I was literally 4 when it was released. I've raided normal and heroic through wod-bfa with multiple breaks in between certain patches. Really looking forward to just bingeing on classic on release. I got guild 2nd lvl 120 during bfa launch where we played all night on release.
---
I'd got a bunch of friends from my current guild that are looking to play, but due to the raid lead not wanting to manage 2 guilds, no longer have a home for classic. 
---
And questions feel free to dm me.
---
Also I'm in a good college and play high tier dota so I'm just inexperienced and not dumb. Also I'm very mechanically sound
---
This spec shaming where every other spec then the “efficient” one is mocked is why they cut them all out. 
---
Still sad I never got my T1 Hunter Shoulders. I just wanted to wear some lawn chairs :-(
---
&gt;I'd rather have sharding than dynamic respawns. Dynamic respawn opens the door for massive xp abuse while sharding only hurts the immersion.
---
I still think AQ event is likely to have more people than initial launch starting zones. In AQ event you have everyone in one zone vs initial launch everyone spread in multiple zones.
---
Tfw it has already been done
---
There's so much misinformation in this thread, I wish people wouldn't speak hot air and mislead others.
---
First and foremost, the RP-PVE servers are (or were) populated by a majority of roleplayers until wrath it was a very pleasant villiage atmosphere. Out of character talk in any public channels (/s /y /e) was a big no, you got blacklisted, you could even get told off by GMs if you did it repeatedly and banned for it. Very slowly since mid-wrath people start coming to roleplay servers but refused to integrate. They refused to roleplay and they refused to engage with anyone except to troll, or use them as a joke. They treated the server like comfy background noise and abused the good nature of the community. (Blizzard scrapped RP realm rules around WoD but the GMs stopped interacting and caring around mid wrath)
---
As the game went down hill this became an increasing trend. After about mid wrath normies started populating goldshire, sites like darknest started to get big and you had lots of people who had never roleplayed, didn't care about the community or contributing, transferring over to use places like Goldshire as hotspots for the roleplay that reads like it was written by someone that has trouble recognizing themselves in the mirror. With the only intention of giving the thinly veiled guise that they were RPing, and not actually self inserting to ERP.   
---
Over time the people that actually made the servers what they were got fed up trying to make a difference, the game's quality was declining, they left. Very slowly roleplayers were replaced by people that had no intention of continuing the culture or contributing but were happy leech the social the benefits the server provided. As more of the old guard left the quality decreased, the community dwindled, until you have what we have today. A minority of roleplayers that are outnumbered by people who don't have a basic grasp, or understanding of the fundamentals and refuse to learn, take advice, or improve themselves. They come to the server to use it as background noise and then screech when they're called out on it.  
---
  
---
As for RP itself, no, plenty of roleplayers have ranked to 14 or raided. They just had enough respect not to be blatantly out of character in public areas.   
---
Once a ret, always a ret
---
Nobody will, and I am pretty sure blizzard knows this. It would seem that making the caps higher are just likely to turn off much of the non pirate server playerbase they are shooting for.
---
Same! Gonna have to recreate my ud lock main from Vanilla, but I basically plan to park him and go play a part of the game I never got to experience.  Gonna play a new class on the opposite faction!
---
Of course, every cool alt idea I have is for horde... 
---
I never liked Paladin Tier 1.  I wasn't particularly excited about raiding to get armor until Judgement.  I loved Lightforge though, so I spent a lot of time getting that and upgrading it to Soulforged.
---
Ah...yeah.  Oops.  I just didn't want to seem like I was passing supreme judgement, so I use that phrase in my posts when it's relevant although I always mean it too.
---
My basic point was that I can hardly tolerate excusing those who intentionally put down other people or even harass them.  I'm not saying you are one of those bad people or someone excusing them.  People certainly shouldn't be too sensitive.
---
I'm just saying there's a line after which things aren't just a joke even though it's hard to say where exactly the line is.  I wish it wasn't such a subjective thing to simply not be a douchebag to people, but oh well.  Just sharing my thoughts like anyone on a message board.
---
Very true, didn’t think about that 
---
gl.   I’m with u.  Miss my blud 
---
I dont care how I look, I'm still super mana efficient and has BoSal. Im loved. 
---
You ever dump and old toaster upside down? God damn what a mess. 
---
A hunter is useful in any scenario of the game, the real issue comes in raids with the fact that the utility they bring coupled with the below average DPS and the fight mechanics means you don't really need more than 2, which can make it tough to find a spot in a good guild. Outside of that hunters will be pretty enjoyable in everything
---
I'm currently doing what I'd call casual raiding.
---
I login twice a week for 2-3hrs for BWL+MC+Ony one night and ZG the next.
---
The gold from the raids covers my repairs and consumables.    
---
But I also don't need to flask.
---
Every few weeks I find some spare time to farm some extra gold.
---
Things will step up a bit soon with AQ40 and eventually Naxx, but that's a future problem.
---
The most important thing is that you're able to show up constantly and regularly.
---
I see it a bit like as if I played a sport, training one day and the game on weekends. Then I get on with the rest of my life during the rest of the week.
---
There is a difference between "Hardware could support" and "Those were the caps" Every source said the cap was 2500, and nearing BC went up to 3kish. The fact that they could let more people in at some point does not indicate that they did.
---
That's what I always do, I dislike waiting in lines in RL, I'm not doing it in a game. That behind said they should change the way all these quests work so this doesn't happen its terrible design. 
---
I literally thought this was one of my screenshots. This deadass looked like mine from wrath 
---
If gold farming is your concern keep an eye on fishing pools, if they are at server start going to tanaris to farm stonescale eels early (easy as hell to do the moment you get to gadgetzan) will be very profitable and likely easier. Even if you don't farm the pools you'll net a lot gold
---
Great story man, thanks for sharing! That's what WoW was all about, such great times.
---
So not really his fault
---
You're right I misread. You'd likely need both to keep it as close to the sever numbers back then for the first days and when the people start spreading out then they could be removed.
---
That became my favorite part of this too.  And to be fair, this fight was primarily about making sure you obtained special buffs to inflate your DPS as much as possible, so there were often major DPS disparities depending on people paying attention or not.  But still, for this guy to do all that with this UI is so ridiculous, lol.
---
I've said this before, but I don't see why this is a problem either. If the servers can handle it, I agree that it shouldn't be sharded. But if it's a choice between a couple of large shards where you're still seeing 200+ people standing around the portal, and constant server crashes and disconnects to the point that you literally can't see the event anyway, I know what my vote is for.
---
I think most people would agree with that. Wotlk and to some extent Cataclysm were the last expansions to build on previous lore while the MoP and onwards was mostly new lore. 
---
Another good example in popular culture is the game of thrones series, the earlier plot was much better and close to the books, but as the series ran ahead the plot got shakier and more "televised" so to speak. 
---
They can change it for pick-up quest items/locked boxes. 
---
The mushrooms in the barrens for an example. They can't be abused either.
---
Or that lock box atop the kul'tiran keep.
---
/u/jcb088 's UI when classic comes: https://i.imgur.com/IJSyNUf.jpg
---
Ha, that explains most modern UI design to me.  I will never understand it.  Stuff that looks like a 4-year old made it is now popular, or at the very least that's what the companies with monopolies on mobile stuff make and everyone has to take it.  I will hopefully never get Windows 10, but I feel like I'll be forced to one day.
---
Plains are natural biomes. They are most often formed by erosion of hills and mountains (same kind that encircle Mulgore) due to weather.
---
Pretty sure back in 2006 there were servers with 1,5k online and others with 3k. They are gonna have to deal with population issues in all cases.1
---
Silvanas did nothing wrong
---
Unavailable due to copyright restriction. Rip
---
And I though my UI was cluttered back then... Thankfully I've cleaned it up a lot over the years on several pserver projects. 
---
I was part of a casual raid guild for half of Vanilla.  We had a once a week 4-hour progression raid and other raids that guild officers pretty much scheduled on add hoc basis for content we had on farm.  Progression was slow (Got stuck for almost 2 months on razorgore , the first boss of BWL).  Made it pretty deep into AQ40 before the news of TBC gearing hit and people lost interest in raiding.
---
We typically didn't use flasks and other buffs on every raid member and relied on increasing our gearing level to deal with the fact that most people were not going spend the money to bring that sort of stuff to raids. So our farming time for raiding mats was minimal.  This was, however, changing towards the end of AQ40 as we had a harder and harder time progressing without being buffed to the gills.
---
Causal raiding is a slow slog because there's only a small core of people who show up for every raid, so it takes longer to get people up to speed on how to handle the encounters due to high numbers of people just raiding every once in a while. 
---
I had a guildie named TankHeals...
---
He was a rogue...  He was awesome...
---
Yes you can put them un bank.
---
Easier way to farm them is during AV weekend, mobs fighting middle. 
---
I suggest you to farm them in felwood along with demonic runes too
---
Assuming you only raid on one character, you wouldn't need more than 3 nights a week for raiding to clear current raids.
---
I'm impressed by your planning. I work on my planning sheet every day but I haven't reached the post-60 section yet.  
---
I'll use your list as inspiration.  
---
God, I miss these little details, when WoW still felt connected to the games I grew up with. 
---
I am pretty much convinced it will happen. Blizzard does not want to alienate a big player base which means less money.
---
Personally I am against sharding as I enjoy the race to 60 with a big giant mess in between. But, ultimately it's only a small part of the game. If sharding is what gets this game onto retail I am willing to compromise. 
---
My question is; Will you guys who are 100% against sharding still play this game? 
---
As always, unless I was playing a healer, I always used the standard UI
---
Class fantasy at its peak
---
the context you showcased was just someone sheeping your mob as a legitimate ban offense...
---
Doesnt even have an FPS counter, what a scrub.
---
Lets be honest here, most of the tier 3 sets were dope AF :)
---
he barely uploads on YouTube (2 videos in the last 11 months) , the asmon watches or asmon reacts are just random people reuploading his stream you shouldn't dislike the guy because other people make those 
---
Rip
---
**I've heard you need to grind REALLY hard and be very invested in the game.**
---
Well that's not not true anymore.
---
We all have crazy schedules. Relax.
---
No, Cataclysm is when real storytelling was added to all the Classic zones, and Wrath zones is when things overall became much more focused with a cohesive story.
---
However, it's not like there's no story at all before Cataclysm.  It's just extremely barebones and left wide open most of the time.  Most quests feel like they're there just to be there.  There are a handful of quests that have real story and feel suitable to be part of the post-Wrath era, like the Alliance Onyxia attunement questline and Taelan Fordring's final quest, but that's probably about it.  Other people are free to remind me of other quests.
---
I don't know why you would never read quests now considering Cataclysm made questing literally what you asked about.  The real thing in video games is that you either care about the story or you don't, and honestly, that won't change between Classic or Cataclysm.
---
Ahah, you're right, I should go boomkin instead
---
I don't miss these days. 
---
Having agency is nice. In theory.
---
But agency simply for the sake of it? In ways that took 60 levels to achieve, that took good to respec, and that really only viable with certain cookie cutter builds? Is that really agency? Or the illusion of agency?
---
Dagger playstyle?
---
Impressive. Mayhaps I should start something like this for the Shaman I'm planning. At least you've done the hard work for the general levelling route / quest mats part for me. 
---
Why would that ever happen. There never been a rule against “stream sniping”. 
---
this looks like it was on a pserver so still not confirmed doable on classic but we will see.  Also a lot of risky strats to get there that's not what I used to do.  Really a speedrun heh.
---
Even if it was a technical limit, it was that way in Vanilla. You could add a bunch of stuff going off these interviews where designers said they didnt have the time or tools to do certain things....
---
The main concern is still handling the initial influx.
---
Yes and you will have to sign a contract that you will play for 2 years. If you break it you will be prosecuted and thrown in jail or fined 1 million dollars in micro transactions and sentenced to 4 years community service developing shitty mobile games for China.

Dragon stalker and cryptstalker are badass
---
without animals (on earth this includes humans) the forest will grow back unless the climate is unsuited for trees. (a mountain range could indeed be a cause for that, like the Rocky Mountains  blocking rainfall to the great plains) 
---
Thank you for that very thoughtful and informative comment!!
---
I think you'd be a good person to ask, do you think RP will work again for classic? What do you think is the level of importance of GM policing in this?
---
Cryptstalker is cool, I hate T1-T2 hunter stuff though.
---
Well done!
---
Half of them will be set to mumble rap this time around.
---
“Slippery slope is a fallacy”
---
*Uses previous changes as precedent to add more*
---
You can see a little of it right above the 3rd set of raid frames.
---
It's often the people who screech for the old talent trees back who are the first to berate people for having the "wrong" talents. When all you do is look up you "optimal build" online wtf is the point in having the rest?  
---
Mostly for themselves I imagen. Theres no way Classic is fun with 200+ ingame players following your every move.
---
That's nice
---
I bet it's easier with the modern API
---
Varimthras? Not sure...
---
its from wotlk
---
I still dont know what the Nostalrius team is supposed to add to all this?
---
ur cool
---
You see how the players are cooperating? Coming up with novel solutions? Player driven content?
---
All of that is impossible with sharding.
---
Sharding kills absolutely all of that player interaction.
---
If you mean a new faction that opposes the horde and alliance, then that'd be a huge expansion. Blizzard would have to make a completely new quest line and said-faction-only strongholds (villages) in contested areas. 
---
It is a cool idea but very unlikely Blizzard would invest that much time in it.
---
Why make any possibility to fail whatsoever? You should just press F to beat the game.
---
2 sets of raid frames as well as party frames, 100% spell icons and expanded buffs. ouch!
---
I'm in your camp, but I'm planning on playing DPS warrior or rogue.
---
The first time you learn to do the Safety Dance, you'll never forget. \^.\^
---
"you can spec however you want*"
---
*but if you want to raid with us you spec like this 
---
Makes me want to stab Azeroth too. Sargeras starting to make sense now. 
---
Ganking is a little annoying while levelling, but once you're 60 it hardly matters any more.
---
I feel like PvP servers have a little more life to them.
---
Some Paladins also switch to Shadow Resist Aura for a bit more Fear/shadow resist, though that takes a relatively high skill cap or is situationally dependent.
---
Yeah, I guess I'm exaggerating a little, though from my experience  the norm is for guilds to already have enough hunters in their roster and for pugs to be full on hunters almost immediately.
---
Did your realm(s) in Vanilla feel empty? I know mine didn't and there you had the same situation after a while with the whole pop spread around over all the zones. 
---
We might disagree about where the lines for what constitutes an appropriate joke are, but I get where you're coming from now.
---
I was on kilrogg eu. Afaik only one horde guild got into naxx, I think only 1 alliance as well. 
---
Three sets!
---
I'd at least try help the poor bastard out with a better build even if they want wyvern sting. That build is so bad that it almost has to be deliberate.
---
Sure that happened, however the game was designed around the population cap in terms of number of mobs, spawn rates of mobs / herbs / ores / clickables, the droprates. If you allow more players and don't properly retune this then you get the shitshows you see on pservers where farmspots are overcrowded, the economy is a mess and stuff like that. 
---
You can definitely do casual MC and Ony. ZG and AQ20 are also totally doable. BWL you'll need a good raid to carry you through so idk about that though pugs for it have existed.
---
AQ40 and Naxx are different beasts, especially AQ40, as counterintuitive as that might sound. Reason being you can stumble through a few naxx bosses with a semi decent raid, but AQ40 has a tough mandatory boss fight almost right at the start.
---
no, my realm was quite healthy during vanilla. and my comment about being spread out all over the world was more directed at people literally being on other sides of the earth from each other and thus in massively different time zones, vs players spread out over the game world.
---
Well if you are 40+ and got that enrage for your pet you can pump good damage. The issue is that turtles already have a 2.0 attack speed and their Shell Shield ability, which boosts their armour by 43% reduces their attack speed by 28%, if I remember the numbers properly.
---
Trib solo as a hunter is no joke to pull off. Either you need to respec for fd or have great gear already, and if you mess up then you need to start the whole run over again. Then you also need invis pots (technically you don't but it saves a lot of time) and seaforium.
---
Actually Survivel is BiS-Talent in Classic if you reach Naxx-Gear. Because the 15% Agi. you get from the Talent makes Hunters go nuts More Crit and More Damage. So many ppl dont even know this.
---
Do you happen to know if there are a lot of people like yourself? I've never played on private servers and would be curious to know if this is a growing trend. 
---
Hey Julian awsome to see your guide here!
---
Some of the sources are from over at the [Classic Warlock discord](https://discord.gg/D6TrRkq).
---
Like the LMW guide (new overhauled one in the make), Dreadstead one, Pre bis list, spell list, hit vs crit, shadowbolt downranking vs lifetap.
---
I would like to let people know that we got a changelog in there to keep track of updates on those list as some of them are works in progress and most of them will be adjusted as we get more information from blizzard/ on release. Plus their might be other respurces in their that are of benefit for warlocks in general aswell.
---
Greetings,
---
Zephan
---
Yeah, but the key word is most. We've had more years post WotLK than before it now. And Wrath was easy, like I have had more raid finder wipes then I had wrath wipes easy. Honestly Cata and MoP were retail's last stand for real difficulty (outside of raid finder, which only existed for one raid in Cata) and since then it has been... Well, I don't have to explain that.
---
i can tell this is a horrible UI. i mean just look at it i can even see some gameplay on the screenshot
---
Fences symbolise the oppression of cows, probably.
---
This. The atmosphere and community outweighs the 1% of the time it’s really annoying by far.
---
you have no idea how easy it is to break this and mage farming. you will see.
---
It’s not a vanilla ui if it’s a pretty ui
---
If that’s your budget, try a Lenovo Y5 series laptop factory refurbished. But it will be overkill for wow.
---
Every class is good in its own right in Vanilla WoW. Thats why it was a great game.
---
Holy shit this is awesome
---
That’s the tooltip yeah but the real utility is breaking certain forms of cc. 
---
That's not even Vanilla - he has flight form
---
Ok, but I don’t fish tho:) takes too long to level IMO
---
Because fuck having fun right?
---
&gt; I dread every Warrior going almost full-on Leather. I get it, it’s the best DPS
---
I started my first pvt server in November, hit 60 over Christmas.  I was shocked at how few warrior tanks there are and at most warriors wearing leather
---
To be fair 1K Peaks is essentially a correct answer, considering there are a lot of peaks.
---
Ah, found it.  They're in separate questrelation tables. Any chance you could pretty please convert them please? creature\_questrelation and gameobject\_questrelation
---
&gt; I won't be able to raid as I've heard you need to grind REALLY hard and be very invested in the game to even get into raid groups
---
Started my first time pvt server in November, first time in WoW since 2006.  Hit 60 over Christmas and was pugging ZG a few days later, then pugging MC and have also filled a healing spot in BWL on two occasions.
---
Admittedly I had to supplement my gear with t1 belt/bracer purchases from AH which won't be possible on a fresh server, and my pvt server is also heavily overpopulated compared to official servers which increases the amount of pug groups.
---
Meh it’s not optimal but it’s playable. Wyvern Sting is not amazing I’d prefer Scatter Shot but it has its uses. It’s not that far off the most optimal survival PvE build 1/20/30. But obviously marksmanship is better. 
---
TB was always my favorite capital. Such a calm and comfy city with the altitude + open air, not so much people but it was never dead, easy navigation to professions/ah/bank.

The one thing I'll miss from retail is being able to fly up to the very top of the huge totem. That was always my favorite place to AFK or queue BG's/Arena.

All the tier 2 sets except mage looks good. For tier 1 i only really like warlock and druid. 
---
They probably know a bit about the mechanics from vanilla based on mass input from their community. They also managed to contain the lag of having a massive population which some technical people may be curious about what they changed throughout the timeline to handle things like this.
---
One little side note is that they had a meeting with Blizzard after shutting down. I don't recall any information being public about what exactly was talked about in the meeting outside from the obvious (classic WoW). 
---
I would do redridge until they too hard and keep an eye for Deadmine LFG and after that go duskwood town pick up FP and some quests. Low level quests are by the river area between westfall and elwyn.   Loch modan will be too much walking for ya... but if u want u can.
---
Although I'd love for this to be streamed so the questions could be rapidly answered and add more hype to Twitch streamers, I guess this will do. Quite curious to see if any info about their meeting will be answered and if any of them got offered to work for Blizzard post-Nost in some sort of situation like imprisoned hacker turns to government affiliate.

I'm not quoting a "server". I'm quoting a user posting on a forum (which happens to be on this server's forum but that's completely irrelevant).

Idc I'm EU
---
You could grind mobs. The quests in RR will get hard fast when you're level 16.
---
Loch or Darkshore are better bets but either way you're running to them. Up to you weather you want to do the run to Darkshore since it would also set up FPs for BFD later. 
---
18:00-12:00 for us Europeans (GMT+1)
---
What is that monstrosity 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Darkshore is a good shout and a great zone to level in.
---
Woohoo got my first mail shoulders yesterday on my paladin
---
I would just go do all of loch modan and then come back and you'll be set to run DM and do redridge and duskwood/wetlands afterwards.
---
If the realm pops are only like 3k then this won't be an issue in the first place regardless of sharding.
---
There are several options. I prefer lvling with 2 handed fury going down to enrage and flurry, but going down arms is very good as well. I dont know much about dualwielding tbh.
---
At least there's virtually no reason to go back there once you hit level 20.
---
Do the few quests in RR you can: lake x2 (tools, necklace), the first gnoll quest, get the horses shoos quest. Grind a bit. Now you can do some lock modan quests (get there by deeprun tram). Go back to SW and get ubderbelly scales, do them. Grind vultures, boars and spiders for redtidge goulash.
---
At 18 you can do DM, but its safer done at 20. At 19 you can do a few duskwood quests (skeletons, spiders and wolves), and the elite ogre quests in Lock Modan. At 20 you can do the Dun Algaz Gauntlett and run to menethil harbour.

Not with Vanilla Realm limits. This happens when you have more than the 2.5k intended players per server. Content was built with that number in mind.

If you don’t recall, after nostalrius was shut down, they met up with blizzard , and basically were the ones who helped convince blizzard of classic. If it wasn’t for nostalrius we may have never gotten classic.

I agree with your post for the most part. And although and incremental tree is fun, the current one feels much more impactful. An hybrid would be a nice idea to test 
---
Leave Sylvanas alone \*cries upfront\*
---
Walking into IF for the first time ever while it's theme song plays is quite the experience
---
If I don't get the game exactly as it was then what's the point of it existing? 
---
For real??
---
Faction is a matter of personal preference. As for server type, I'd say go for a PvP server. 
---
Ganking is a bit annoying, but also a part of the vanilla experience. There just something about seeing the enemy in the same zones, and being able to attack them or get attacked.  
---
It makes me more aware of me surroundings, and thus noticing things that I might have missed, if I just went on auto pilot questing/grinding :)
---
Yes, just find a less hardcore guild with a schedule and mentality that fits you :)
---
UBRS, MC and Ony are easy enough that most guilds attempting them will succeed. 
---
AQ 20 and ZG are a step up in difficulty, but I remember clearing them as teenage me with no real clue as to what I was doing back in the days.
---
BWL is considered easy by today's standards, however It did break weaker guilds back in the day.
---
AQ40 is hard. Casual guilds will struggle.
---
Naxx is probably the hardest raid ever... Not in terms of mechanics.. If you are a mythic raider on retail the mechanics themselves will be piss easy. The problem is the huge requiring of consumables, gear and gold to progress. Basically, to do it you need the best great available up until this point (countless hours of farming BWL and AQ40) on top of a redicculus list of consumables. We will obviously see a lot more guilds clearing it now, than back in the day, but those guilds will be anything but casual.
---
are there discords for other classes ?
---
so either NDAs or blizzard killed them.
---
Guys, this post isn't judging people who go different specs or ignore cookie cutter builds. It's a joke on non OCD people who can have messy and unfinished talent branches like this ( 3/5 rather than 5/5 ).
---
There are but not all of them are active. Main active ones would be Druid, Fight club warrior one and the warlock one. Mage recently got Infra as an admin and is spurring up and the Hunter and Rogue one also got admins now altough they don't seem as active yet. 
---
You can find a list for all kinds of discord in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a52p9o/discord_list/ or in the #resources channel in the warlock discord
---
It's not spec shaming but a joke on non OCD people who dont mind having random, messy and unfinished talent branches.
---
Wow phase 1 looks rly cheesy. Never thought of doing it this way.
---
I don’t know if it’s worth taking over trueshot aura in a raid setting but when it comes to the hunter’s solo damage survival scales better when you have a lot of agi.
---
Post it here,

---
As others have said, pugging will be viable most likely.
---
If you can commit some time (on a fixed schedule), there will be various guilds too, I'm sure. Maybe even more than hardcore guilds.

For example I'm creating a guild for raiding (or more accurately, seeing and clearing all content, which is basically raids). We'll be a no rush guild, we'll not even start raiding at least half a year from release. Plenty of time to level and gear up. After we start raiding we'll do two raid nights per week (most likely) which is the real commitment because they'll take many hours but you can allocate time to the game as you can and/or see fit otherwise (if you show up for raids and can pull your weight, of course).
---
As a life long, dedicated undead player, hard pass. 
---
Must be a glitch vanilla is in the wrong spot
---
dagger doesn't work without frontstab.
---
&gt; Only thing that seemed out of place was the lfr interface
---
ONLY thing? This was also a tiiiiny bit out of place: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx9cSwgsbKQ
---
&gt;Everyone gets this confused.
---
Including you. Ion stated that it is when a loot goes to a wrong person. He does not mention need or greed - actually he only mentions master loot as an exact example, but leaves it open that it could be other ways too.
---
If it is for greed it does not even  make any sense. That would not solve the problem they are trying to.
---
This guy is correct. Survival is the #1 PvE spec for hunters in Naxx gear (and even slightly before). Nobody needs last point though :P
---
Orc for the stun resist I guess? I assume pet damage bonus is basically insignificant.
---
&gt; Like look at [this item](https://i.imgur.com/lrPcNoZ.png) from DM: W. That is just disgusting. That item is probably Molten Core quality or better.
---
According to a BiS list for my class, that's the 6th best set of pants all the way through Naxx, and better than anything that drops anywhere in all of AQ or ZG.
---
Compare it, for example, to [Animist's Leggings](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19877) from Bloodlord Mandokir in Zul'Gurub. The Dire Maul piece has 2 more intellect, 7 more healing, and 6 MP5.
---
You don't HAVE to go to Darkshore, and Redridge has 2 or 3 quests you can do easily enough even when underleveled. At the stage you're at you could honestly do any of the three zones, though westfall means mostly grinding for a level or two.
---
Pvp makes things so much more tense, and as annoying as it is, it also gives you that many moments that give you a huge adrenaline rush! I remember herbing in EPL as a hunter and having a tauren warrior charge me out of nowhere, then kiting him around in a panic and barely managing to kill him. Little silly things like that leave a very positive memory and that sort of thing makes pvp servers feel so much more fun imho! Then there's stuff like raiding and trying to get into the raid without losing buffs. It's more tedious to go about things with that extra factor at play but it also makes it feel so much more rewarding!
---
Every mage can farm the bracers and dme. 
---
This would be the correct answer:p
---
I basically do the same thing atm. If you care about consumables then you'll have to make a decent stockpile of gold before you settle into this raid logging mode, and the better your guild the easier and cheaper it will all end up being. 
---
In a raid the pet is the least of the problem.
---
If you need to show up regularly and consistently it's hardly casual.
---
Yeah It's Hodir.
---
This whole raid was design perfection imo. 
---
Good grief, xperl AND grid, whyyyy
---
There are many different definitions for what a casual gamer is.
---
I'd argue that 4-6hrs/wk is pretty damn casual.    
---
But if you define it another way, that's fine too.

Thank you for the insights, that makes a lot of sense.

At least the very situational spirit buff is Christmas mistletoe /kiss buff you can give someone else. You can gather loads of these easily in the 1-2 weeks the event is up.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=21519](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21519) 
---
When it launches it's going to be like this. 2.5k players doing the same quests at once :P
---
20 spi, nice!
---
The plan is to get killing blows, enabling 100% in-casting mana regen (actually 50% of 200%). Mp5 would not beat spirit given that one can land those killing blows!
---
&gt; The problem is the huge requiring of consumables, gear and gold to progress
---
The thing that has changed is, that you know what you need, right now for the launch of naxx. Meaning when the server is opened, you can use \~1.5 years gathering materials for NAXX. Get them +frost resistance gears, +nature gears for AQ etc. 
---
Because of the timeframe it doesnt mean massive amount of hours spent when the instance is live, you can do hour there another here and have bank full of stuff for it.
---
What top end guild is going to allow you to come without at least full consumables?
---
Roughest part of playing on vanilla private servers is that ElvUI doesn't work properly.
---
&gt;2500 on a pserver feels empty cause they're spread out over the whole damned planet.
---
Exactly. Not to mention that the 10k servers are half filled with chinese people who don't interact with the english-speaking population in any way. Then there's probably a few thousand russians on top.
---
You should add the Guybrush spreadsheets, he did an amazing work.
---
What makes you think they are "practicing"? Maybe they are just having fun.
---
Vanilla has something no expansion has dublicated. Community. People that say it will fail likely never played vanilla. 
---
What’s bad about this spec? Looks pretty fun to me. Great for levelling too with the traps talents!
---
\&gt; I've heard you need to grind REALLY hard and be very invested in the game to even get into raid groups.
---
Id say the biggest hurdle for everyone is the grind to 60 and somewhat prebis gear. On one or multiple chars. Thats the BIG grind, after that you can limit your hours from daily gaming to raid-logging. Early content is quite easy and if DM is in the launch gearing for it will be even easier. So you are literally just getting gold for future and current raid consumables and you have a LOT of time to get them.
---
Was the meeting at a blizzard embassy in Turkey?
---
Just go PvE. PvP servers are seriously overrated, and it seems like you have no interest in ganking people who just want to quest.
---
I'm quite on the same spot. It feels strange tho since I used to be a hybrid throughout all my playtime. 
---
Mage data please!
---
"Blizzard ruined their own game!"
---
No, Blizzard tailored the game to fit the players. Proves that devs should not listen to too much feedback. Players are shit at making games.
---
I'm trying to think what I'll do better this time around. I'll have a headset so that should improve communication. I used to type everything during dungeons/raids. A relatively easy thing to do as a mage but not as effective/efficient as using a mic. I'll be rolling a warrior this time around so will take the lead on dungeons but have no plans to lead raids or run a guild. 
---
LOL 
---
Im interested in joining! What time zone do you plan on playing in? 
---
You can raid without being in a top end guild. You won't be hitting any world firsts but at this point, it's classic, nobody will be.
---
I agree. It forces you into community. You cant understand it if you didnt play it. Once you make some friends, friends dont quit on friends. Love it
---
Thx for the nice buff links!!
---
Even there there's quite a good amount of hostility. 
---
It'll be quite worse than getting a heavily contested spot and you'll be taking the shit if something goes wrong whether is your fault or not and replaced at first issue (so yeah, you may even get kicked because of a slacker/group of them). 
---
Getting gear will make some *feel* robbed (or well, you'll get barely any gear at all) since they'll consider you don't provide *anything*. This also may draw out people from the guild to *more serious* guilds.
---
Unless your social skills are great and commitment is great as well you're in for a rough way of trouble. Or at least this is my experience.  
---
It'll really depend on your class.
---
Some classes can get away with it, at least in the earlier raids/patches. Because the consumables available don't make any noticeable difference.
---
Of course you can, but that has nothing to do with the OP's assertion that casual raiders should look for a top-end guild and expect to get away with not even having consumables.
---
Also Naxx. They say the game will die after naxx comes out. As if people will be clearing it left and right. That's not gonna happen. This isn't wotlk Naxx.
---
I'm just going to keep talking to myself. You inspired me to have a go myself and I managed to figure it out by googling some basic python shit. Here's the results:

Thanks for the inspiration :)
---
Locks and mage can farm dme in blues and greens
---
I agree with you, salvation isn't this worth for a rogue. Salvation seems better for War/Lock/Mage.
---
About vanish, do you need to swap trinket during a fight as rogue ?  Salvation could allow you to start burst earlier before swapping
---
I’m really not worried about it. Unlike retail wow, vanilla took a lot of work to get through. It’s not a week of casual play til max level and then grind some end game stuff for a weekend then raid once a week. 
---
For example I resubbed to retail a bit ago just to gold farm so I can use retail to pay for my sub and I was a little curious about the new content. A month and a half later after just casually gold farming I’m somehow in full epics with a 372 ilvl without doing any mythic dungeons or even LFR. End game isn’t needed to progress, it just helps you progress faster. 
---
Professions are incredibly simple now. Very few mats to farm and no random drops needed like essences, spidersilk etc. No rare patterns/recipes to farm either. Just wait til a certain daily pops up and you can upgrade something you alrdy knew but now it’ll be cheaper and may make extras sometimes. No skill book farming either. Passive gold income covers any necessary expenses so that’s not required either. 
---
Yes I’m sure I’ll get through classic faster than I did vanilla however there’s a ton of content to work and grind through that’ll still take time and effort. It’ll be fun regardless and definitely last longer than any recent expansion Blizzard has made. Sure it may fail at some point however it’s definitely going to provide a ton of fun and nostalgia for months , most likely longer, and it can’t possibly be worse than retail is now so it’s not like theres any other options out there
---
It is common knowledge for hunters that knows their class, the "problem" is it requires Naxx gear. Almost no one will reach that, and those who does will still have to wait untill Naxx releases and then however long it takes to actually gear up in Naxx. It's such a small percentage of players and so far away that it's almost irrelevant. 
---
As for hunters that doesn't know it, they will never reach a point where they need to anyway.
---
Yeah, I agree with you 100%. Hence, the part about that we will see a lot more guilds clearing it. I intend to run such a guild myself. But unfortunately it will be hardcore/semi-hardcore, as is still hundreds of hours from reach player, not exactly what OP was looking for.
---
Because I know them, personally.
---
Yesterday I watched a Classicast on YouTube and a former manager of Blizzard brought the Nost guys in contact with Blizzard and said in the video that he was really impressed with both the skills of these devs as well as their development process. I wouldn't be surprised if at least some of those guys are currently working for Blizzard on WoW Classic, since they also have passion for the product, which is very important.
---
Mark Kern tells this somewhere in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izCBaGfGJCg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izCBaGfGJCg)
---
No 
---
Yes, the big nemesis of warlock are rogues. Trinkets in vanilla only work on different impairments and warlocks dont get out of stun. They also dont have blink, therefore they just sit in the stun and eat it.
---
They can eat fears and all kinds of magic with felhunter, but rogues really eat them alive early to mid server progression.
---
Also warlock shoulders look EPIC on orcs. You legit start to look like Gul'dan with R13 shoulders.
---
Hi, /u/Sone3D
---
You gotta alternate between early zones as alliance, so either go loch modan or darkshore and then go back westfall later. Redridge is also a zone to rotate.
---
Usually the route I'd go with would be something like:
---
10-13 loch modan, 13-15 westfall, 15-16 loch modan, 16-18 redridge, do dm, finish westfall, go redridge, then alternate between duskwood and wetlands (and finish redridge). 
---
Never understood why people show the combatlog at all times. I always have it in the same window as the chat just a different tab, not like i need to look at it at all times...
---
&gt;R13
---
Someone's aspiring to be a big shot!
---
This is just how humans are. 
---
We want freedom to shoot ourselves in the foot. 
---
Freedom and “well being” are often diametrically opposed. Give people freedom and theyll do dumb things with it, but take it away and they’ll rebel. 
---
I think so, yes. Classic will definitely be different from what it was like in 2006, I can only guess what it will be like when streamer fans occupy a specific location because said streamer is there, and most of the bigger streamer communities seem pretty annoying in general. 
---
And the so-called "streamer privilege" will definitely be a problem where a huge chunk of the communities will be funneling gold and various items to the streamers.
---
I would really love if some big streamer just enjoyed the game and understood that it would be a different game if they were live during gameplay. but why would they play offline, right? 
---
Still gonna watch Lirik play tho. :&gt;
---
What the fuck is this?
---
End-Game has a better Scaling compared to other Specs.  The 15% Agi. Increases with Naxx-Gear your stats really really high which turns out that your Damage will be insane. You will have +50% Crit Chance. THis Build is only used if you have AQ40/Naxx Gear.
---
Prepare for Forsen, the worst community of all.
---
Even with retail talents it is a problem. You can always do the math and find which is the strongest, just like old talent trees. The way retail talents can give you a choice is with effects. One example is both single target and AoE on the same row. This way they don't directly compete, they are good at different things. This brings worse problems, though, like Boomkins in Legion that had to choose between AoE or ST build and suck at the other one, while other classes didn't have to choose. The only rows I think works in retail are utility types. They are somewhat up to preference and easier to balance since there isn't any exact number you have to balance.
---
As for the old talents, I believe they can work, but needs to be designed slightly different. First of all, I think it's fine for PvE to have an optimal spec. Players will always find it and it's impossible to balance fully.
---
PvP is another story, though. Hunter is a great example for this and so is Warlocks. They can have many types of build. In PvP you also got the choice of glass canon (PvE build) or gradually change some "BiS dps talents" to utility. For example hunters can put 5 points Efficiency into Improved Concussive Shot.
---
Lastly, this is where talent change cost is important. If it cost a lot to change only the most hardcore will do so weekly. This means PvE players will simply not have the utility to fight in PvP and thus be weaker when running around the world. This is a trade off. It also opens up for "all around" players that might like to try and grap a few defensive talents for PvP, but also be okay in PvE with core talents.
---
So overall I find old talents to be much more fun and the "choice" and impact of retail is mostly an illusion, except the utility rows. Your idea of a hybrid might be really awesome.
---
It works in theory but you won't always have the killing blow, especially if you do pug dungeon, shadow priest spell are very mana  costy and if you fail the 2 first killing bow you might get oom before the 3rd mob is dead.
---
Plus against some mob that have high amount of hp or bosses you won't have any killing bow in the first second of the fight.
---
I would recommend gearing toward Spirit and using spirit consumable but also using MP5 consumbale.
---

---
Go for a balance/feral hybrid and u will win everything.
---
Wearing NR gear seems a bit excessive, but hey it worked and got you world first:D But i guess it gives more margin for error during the dance.
---
On most of the blizzlike pservers I have played on there are usually PuGs that clear BWL or MC in an an hour or so. You really don't need to spend as much time on the game anymore to clear end-game content. Seems that information being built up over the years has made most end-game raiding fairly easy in vanilla. AQ40 and Naxx are fairly different because even though a fair few hardcore guilds clear them in the first night many other guilds still take a while to clear them.
---
This is also why i don't like transmog, i feel it completely removes this part of the game. A big appeal for people is to show of their gear and simply look cool.
---
He linked the editable version and someone did that with it. I linked a pdf I could get befor that happend in another comment here.

He put it out giving everyone edit access, so a troll did it. Check out /u/VibiusR comment for a backup.

Why the down votes good sir?
---
You're quite correct

---
And I dinged 80 right as ICC came out at which point because of the badge plz patch I could just buy the Ulduar set for badges and get better gear pugging TOC and ICC. So I think I went into Ulduar once and I really feel like I missed out. Damn that patch to hell, gear resets in the middle of an expansion is so fucking stupid.

Darkshore, redridge or go to IF and start questing there (loch modan)
---
Druid is, imo, the most complex class to play, you can be a bad druid or a good druid depending of your skill lvl.
---
A bad druid think he's feral so he only play in tiger form for example; a good druid know that he has to use all his ability to win.
---
1. If you know your class and your opponent's one then you can win against every single class.
---
2. Sure some class will give you a hard time but given enough skill you can beat every class consistently.
---
3. Yes and no, depending the two classes you're facing (2 mages is a hard one) and how well you use your cc, mana, etc.
---
4. Well if you ran into a raid there is a high chance you die but generally speaking drood can easily escape from most fight (outside) thanks to root and increased run speed.
---
5. Depend on what spec you want to play, if you're full mana you'll always be able to top yourself but as a feral you'll have limited mana and you should use bandage when possible.
---
6. A geared war can one-shot you, a shaman can down you in 2gcd, a rogue could kill you in a stunlock if lucky on crit, a mage could kill you the same way a shaman can,... every class is better than the drood but you have to be better than every player.

How does it feel to use an Open Source projects work (MaNGOS) and get flown to Blizzard HQ for it? A honest answer would be interesting.
---
Well dota is a different story. The thing is, somewhat high-rated games (around 6k and above) is happening only on EUW. You kinda forced to play there no matter where you from, in order to avoid the ranks imbalance / meet the pro-players.
---
But youll have less tourists, it’s easier to boot up classic wow and make a lvl 1 than trek to AQ with their low lvl character. Im talking about the people who would never reach 60. 
---
If you take just the 60s on a server it’d be way less than starter zones on launch day
---
Isn't forsen also gonna be playing Classic Wow?
---
For 1.12.1 for private servers? I have a Korean client that I stumbled upon. Can't upload it till tomorrow, but I could throw it up then if you are still looking. Items and quests all depend on the server so there aren't really any translations for quests on any servers I know of, but items are translated on the most popular private server at least.
---
One tiny thing different and it might no longer work at all. Imo it is easier to make a DMN that is not solo farm able than one that is so chances are it won't work.
---
The observer not being splittable actually isn't much of and issue because of range and Los.

Ofc I know this. It’s about “how far can I take this” rather than trying to prove that SG + ST is the new best ever spec. It’s a fun playstyle and that’s that.
---
Regarding long fight in dungeons: This is just a matter of having enough int and a mana pot here and there.
---
Thx for the list of consumables. 
---
#/# no changes 
---
It has to be korn, soil work, soil, Linkin park. If not. Classic is ruined!
---
FIrst time I've seen someone do it this way, gotta be an exploit, or an unintended way to do it. Awesome to see the warrior wearing the UBRS shield and tier 1 shoulders in naxx - good times ^^
---
A lot of the player base is at the age where they don't have a lot of time to play so people will be looking for and forming more casual raiding guilds. And by 'casual' I mean slower progression, not that they have to be shit players who don't care about enchanting their gear. Some people seem to get confused about that.
---
What's really fucking sad is that hunters do terrible dps when that is their only role. So nobody wants them in the raid except to tranq shot but it's the easiest class to level so there are a bajillion of them. Not good Blizz.
---
fuck i never played classic wow but when  i see all of those enjoyable expériences that you guys all had makes me wanna be a part of the  Community and play it i can't wait for it to come out 
---
Any ranged class can farm first boss in DM:N. I grinded mail shoulders and caster cloak on my elemental shaman. Took longer time than mage or warlock but was doable.
---
the question is, how many players are going to stick with wow classic in the long run. i think its pretty hard to predict. if you have a low cap there is the danger that the server will die cause of low population.
---
Spec sounds really fun - especially if running with a group that knows you are using it, and therefore e.g. change mobs before they die to maximise your killing blow potential. I love whenever healing through damage is made possible somehow, (In Age of Conan there was the bear shaman, and from what I could tell in Legion, both Disc priests and Holy Pallys were similar) this looks like the closest we could get in Vanilla. 
---
I think it could make for some really cool speed runs, especially if you ran with a warlock to benefit from Shadow weaving, and maybe a  hybrid druid tank. 
---
I love when vanilla classes are used alternatively, this is a really cool example :) 
---
It also will depend on how Spirit Tap is coded. If it can proc by killing a https://classicdb.ch/?item=5052 than Spirit would become the "meta" stat. Thus granting players the option to put less points in mana regen talent since its not needed, and deposit them more in talents that bolster healing/damage.
---
Oh I know, and the cookies were for putting up with the tediousness. After all I was a 300 unarmed/bow/crossbow/gun warrior. Was always entertaining getting that last percentage or two in health off a mage or druid after being rooted by shooting them.
---
same thought here. when the cap is too low, there is a possiblity the server dies, when some players leave early.
---
Sorry, I'm slightly too hyped about your build..   
---
I just realised that this spec would be viable for raiding, granted that there's 16 debuff slots, as many guilds use a holy priest with shadow weaving instead of a "real" shadow priest - of course you wouldn't get to use your playstyle as much, but you'd possibly be able to raid with your fantasy spec.
---
AND if you take imp psychic scream and silence you'll have a beastly pvp offensive healer spec too.... dang. 
---
&gt; I'll have a headset so that should improve communication
---
no, please, no ventrilo, I hate this, deformed voices can'T comprehend anything
---
&gt; A relatively easy thing to do as a mage but not as effective/efficient as using a mic
---
I'm a master as a resto druid. I used to type /cast Entagling Roots or /cast Regrowth alongside the lines, on BG's.
---
Then, macros came, so I could even type /cast [target:Boy] Regrowth
---
Then CRZ came, and I forgot how to type...
---
Thats why sharding is/was being considered
---
Op, i agree that making changes to classic is not allowed, but you can up your meme game from vanilla times. 
---
My first character back in Vanilla was a nelf Hunter. I've been considering rolling the same again for nostalgia reasons... but hunters don't really bring much to any groups.  
---
First time round, my reasoning was 'OMG I CAN HAVE A TIGER THAT FOLLOWS ME AROUND?!' 
---
This time, I'm struggling justify it. 
---
Ventrilo is still a thing? I thought that would've been replaced with something else by now. I haven't played since 2007.
---
&gt; Professions are incredibly simple now. Very few mats to farm and no random drops needed like essences, spidersilk etc.
---
are you sure we're talking about BfA?
---
There are thos essences... bind-on-pickup ones.
---
&gt; Yes I’m sure I’ll get through classic faster than I did vanilla however there’s a ton of content to work and grind through that’ll still take time and effort. It’ll be fun regardless and definitely last longer than any recent expansion Blizzard has made. 
---
Also, don't forget about the minimalism thing. When WOW was around, there was quite not much choice - WOW, lineage 2, everquest, runescape, ultima online, tibia... to name most of those I know.
---
So, one thing, you quite had nowhere to go if you were bored, and you were just afking in Stormwind or Ironforge. Other thing, you could play with your RL friends.
---
Now, friend 1 plays Fortnite, friend 2 plays DotA, friend 3 plays Sword Art Online, friend 4 plays Final Fantasy XIV, friend 5 doesn't need a computer because there are mobile games, friend 6 plays only on consoles..
---
Seems like the best thing one can do find out which servers will popular streamers be on and avoid it altogether.
---
How do either of those statements have anything to do with each other?
---
Thanks, will do. but its not really a group. :p 
---
Im gonna start a hardcore guild aiming to be #1 on a german ( unlikely, unless we all are germans. ) or an EU based english server.
---
​
---
Not even gonna type much here, just created a discord with a post about what i want and what i expect you to be.
---
Since its gonna get build from nothing ill already search for a few people here.
---
If ure interested and like to know the details, throw me a discord message.
---
Wail of banshee
---
Huntards have real good burst, but dps is lacking.
---
If my character is ever deleted by blizzard I’m instantly out 
---
Is there a beta out, or is this just on private servers? 
---
Yes! Definitely. However, casual players with chaotic gaming schedule might need to stick with only PUGs because they are too unreliable for scheduled guild raids. That is fine for casual player though, there will be plenty of pugs for various raids.
---
Believe the times posted are CST but they are friendly for anyone based in NA.

Devilsaur. It's not even very good because you'll likely replace it with T1 very quickly, but you still will almost certainly need to get it to prove that you know what the hell you're doing. Unless you already have a guild lined up that you'll be in then you need to go out of your way to show that you're the hunter that they want to give loot to, and competition will be rough.
---
Other than that, know how to farm mara and/or trib. Engineering us worth it for trib farm alone, and making your own best arrows is a neat bonus. I'm going to level an alt to do alch I think.
---
You might be underestimating the effort it takes to get your alt to 60 and level through it all for a second time. I cant do it to be honest, so I never end up with any alts
---
Well, they haven't found Hoffa yet and look at his legacy. Seems plausible that C'Thunovision-Blizz has a graveyard for outliers, eh? 
---
2.5k players divided between 6 starter zones with respawn times that aren't bugged. I doubt it'll be anything like this.
---
Oh the 3 general ones that are pretty much universally used a little by just some professions? The most I’ve seen those used for is for low-mid 300 gear for a fresh 120 if they want to gear up a little faster or skip a bit of farming. 
---
Game diversity is pretty much the same. You’re forgetting your Halo Xbox friends or your God of war PS friends. There were just as many good games then as they’re are now. We just have a ton more trash game options. What’s left for MMORPGs? Wow, BDO, FF 14, just about as many options as there were then. 
---
Like I said though I’m really not worried about it. It’ll be fun and it’ll last awhile unless Blizzard makes too many  changes or the wrong ones. If private servers can stay alive than I’m sure classic can too for a bit
---
Imagine if they flown all admins and devs of private servers to Blizzard HQ. There would never have been so many Adidas jackets in the same place
---
PvE creates the weird experience of big groups of Horde and Alliance milling around each other without any real tension. You can't communicate, have nothing to do with each other and just have to avoid accidentally AOEing people with yellow names.
---
Why even have the opposing factions visible in the world, you may as well have the servers sharded by faction to reduce server load and only meet in BGs.
---
What encounter?  I don't see any encounter.  I don't see anything at all.

Sounds about right

May I suggest putting in an * and talking about the wand you can get from a quest in the Ashenvale dungeon? That thing is BIS for like 15 levels. Only worth it though if you can put together a group you know will full clear / get a carry.

Though, at the same time. Gauge your audience. Obviously this was going trigger people. Pretty sure most of us have some fairly shitty memories of spec shaming in vanilla.. 
---
Haha, awesome :D yeah I know, right. Dungeons - raid holy weaving - pvp... even some only-somewhat-gimped damage. Sounds like a lot of fun right. Although ana/bene is on a 1 hr cd, so I’d go with anathema I think, or maybe bene on hard dungeons...so many options.

Simplistic doesn't mean simple or minimal. It means overly simple. Something that is simplistic does not work correctly.
---
Thanks! You guys helped me out a lot and definitely recommend everyone join the warlock discord.

I know what the literal word means. If That’s what you associate simplistic addons with, that’s on you. It’s more of a term for sleek and simple looking UIs.

---
Possible, but I would say that AQ event player amount is significant enough that argument 'how is blizz going to handle AQ event (or any other big event) if they can't handle starting zones' is still worth discussing.
---
Just be prepared to hate anything in an enclosed space. I mean it gives you an excuse to go first person if anything.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/quest=6561/blackfathom-villainy for reference.
---
It's a great wand! While leveling I don't recommend dungeons unless you have a trusted group because of the risk and time involved in setting them up. You can easily wait to replace people, etc.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=11290 is a good alternative 3 levels later.
---
This spec came about when I ended up being the only person who would heal in BGs. It isn't for going out and being a shadow priest, it is for helping to secure flags.
---
Troll is, on paper, a very good horde race for hunter. However you have to put up with hideous troll toes and the godawful noises they make when hit. Go orc or tauren instead.
---
When you decided to close down Nost the second time (after handing the reins to You know who) did you at that point know, or how confident did you feel, that Blizzard would eventually announce Classic?
---
Where you prepared for the inevitable backlash from the private server community?
---
I agree those pserver with 10k pop is not an original experience at all.
---
I am worried tough that after the initial hype the 2/3k pop servers will go to 1/1,5k pop and blizz wont do anything about it :s

whats the origin of this? I've heard it, but i have no clue where..

That's great!  What I said still stands, unless you were 100% focused on healing then I would put the rest in disc.  The 10 points in holy just seem a bit wasted to me.

I never got devilsaur in vanilla, so that is definately on my bucket list. I hope I'm able to farm the leather myself, so crossing my fingers that the dinos aren't camped 24/7.
---
you can go into the questie lua and put the minimap icon size it .01 and it will remove all of the garbage on your minimap 
---
Resistance stats are a separate mechanic, and the target having higher resist stats doesn't increase the hit cap. It can be a bit confusing since they are both called resists, but they are two completely independent events. One is missing the target. The second is being resisted. Anything that says it changes resist or hit chance by a % is actually changing the chance to be missed by the spell.
---
I second this
---
Wow, I have never actually seen a line in game before. Usually it's just a mass of players directly over the object or spawn location clicking as fast as they can or spamming spells.
---
Sometimes you'll see a handful of players begin to open the object at the same time, but only one can walk away with it. Everyone else gets an empty loot window.
---
They had servers that ran the gamut from empty to full (2500 ish) But having a server with fewer people in it does not require any changes to the game. It's designed for 2500, having fewer people is not great when it gets too low, but when you go above 2500 you need hacky things like dynamic respawns and changes to profession nodes. 
---
Dealing with population issues is different from allowing overpopulation in a world that can't handle it and still be vanilla. I get that you like the higher pop for whatever reason and that's fine. But it is not vanilla, it's a modded funserver kind of thing and that should stay in the realm of pirate servers just like the raids set up for 5 man groups and vendors with all the raid and pvp gear on them.
---
If you're going rogue, and not playing on a PVP server you're doing yourself a big disservice. 
---
Option B: Have a good game to play while keeping Classic fresh. Fun meme though
---
I played a hunter but I agree with you. DPS was not comparable to a caster most of the time. The only thing I felt useful doing was kiting shit in raids sometimes, or as you said, CC
---
My issue is absolutely nothing stops them from sharding something like the AQ event already. People act as if this is some line in the sand where if they don't implemented sharding in the starting zones, then it will never happen again. Back here in reality, thanks to the Blizzcon demo we know sharding is built into the server, it's a switch they can reach for whenever they damn well please. Nobody at Blizz is gonna avoid sharding later simply because they didn't use it at launch.
---
Yeah that’s my thought exactly. even if you followed a build 80% you’d still have about 10 points or so to wiggle things around to fit an odd niche or fit your personal play style 
---
Maybe they added some tentacles at the outgoing door so the casters couldnt stand there. Forcing them to take the platform and melee dance the whole fight.
---
But yeah, never saw this tactic before... i thought everyone (us included) did it with melee tanking it while dancing the whole fight.
---
Gotta admit, im sure i would fail it now (while back then it was so simple to do).
---
yes, but #nochanges
---
I don't think that will be representative of the normal situation.
---
Population density at 60 is everything toward hitting that tipping point where PUG raiding becomes viable.
---
If the pop density is even say, 30% lower, you'll have 30% fewer people PUG raiding. That means it'll not take 30% longer to fill raids, more like 2-3x as long (and tougher to be successful when you can't pick the correct compositions). This means fewer people are willing to PUG raid and more people are willing to join up in a guild.
---
The latter one :)
---
It's simply a new game for me. I haven't played originally. I bet there are others.
---
I had an Orc Warrior called Resplx.
---
And (although not classic) a Blood Elf Paladin called Undeadshaman, I was quite proud of that one.

---
UC is everything bad they removed from the original IF rolled into one awful package.
---
Looks amazing, obviously, one of the most characterful and fun cities to be in, but terrible from a game POV.
---
&gt; and my pvt server is also heavily overpopulated compared to official servers which increases the amount of pug groups.
---
Pretty sure I already said that
---
Yes, but you didn't estimate the impact.
---
Between like 16-28ish i would say there is alot of jumping back and forth zones. I usually do in this order Westfall &gt; Darkshore &gt; Redridge &gt; Ashenvale &gt; Duskwood &gt; Darkshore &gt; Redridge &gt; Duskwood &gt; Ashenvale. So there is alof of back and forth since all these zones have green/yellow/orange quests even at lvl 25-27. And then u go southshore etc. after that :)
---
I noticed you go demonology after imp. drain soul, but you don't get improved VW? I thought that was like the whole point of going 5 into demonology? I see you list in under alternatives, but why not just cut out the demonology all together and get to nightfall/siphon life faster?
---
I noticed your macro section was empty, you might as well add:
---
&gt;/cast Drain Soul(Rank 1)
---
/run local a=GetBagName(4); if a=="Core Felcloth Bag" or a=="Felcloth Bag" or a=="Soul Pouch" or a=="Box of Souls" or a=="Small Soul Pouch" then PickupContainerItem(4,GetContainerNumSlots(4)) DeleteCursorItem() else end
---
I usually cut out the bags I'm not using so I can add:
---
&gt;/script CastPetAction(2)
---
And unless you want to physically change your keybind to pet attack, which I don't because of alts, I use this:
---
&gt;/script CastPetAction(1)
---
And at this point I'm just copying macros from the Warlock Discord but these two are pretty much required as well:
---
&gt;/script if not IsAutoRepeatAction(#) then CastSpellByName("Shoot") end
---
&gt;/script SpellStopCasting()
---
/cast Fear
---
No bejeweled, might as well uninstall.
---
I don't understand this post - surely all the sweaty man children will have optimum dps spec already?
---
Most people saying and accepting the wrong word doesnt make it the right word. I appreciate when people offer me word tune ups. Apparently you don't. No worries.
---
You can only proc ST from mob that grant you experience or players granting you honor.
---
Imo the footage is a joke where the priest dotted a running mob and killed the critter at the same time that a tick of the dot killed the mob running off-screen 
---
Seems like a whack-a-mole encounter (i.e.: healing)
---
Oh yeah forgot about the CD - still pretty damn cool though.   
---
I've had a hard time deciding if I wanna play priest or druid when Classic lands, I just thought I had settled on druid.... but the priest is back in the game.. 
---
Does this make Staff of Westfall a solid warrior leveling weapon?
---
Dont say "better". Say "different" because I think you tried your best in those vanilla times :-)
---
This makes me feel bad.  I'm 100% certain I had a "fun Hunter spec" and had zero clue what I was doing wrong.
---
There are many people that would love to see the improved character models and textures but you will not find them in this subreddit. To answer your question - no, Blizzard will not create a remake/remaster of the original wow. It will be the old version with old textures. Personally, I would love to see the WoW Classic with the retail graphics but many people are against that as they want the old feeling of the game. Each to their own I say. 
---
wow try reading peoples posts before you reply to them, bye
---
Because it wasn’t needed. The same way getting “one shot” is used to describe getting killed fast as well. It’s accepted within the community. There’s no need to discuss the literal meaning of the word, when context changes it.
---
That's not actually what I was looking for. It was actually a site that you can enter in your spell power and it calculates it on a graph for the different ranks of a spell. This is helpful though too 
---
There will be some graphical improvements like lighting, shadow, better water texture and increased foliage.
---
There won’t be any updates to character models or any other textures. They will remain the same.
---
There will be a “Classic graphics” button that lowers the graphics enough to meet the standards Vanilla had.
---
Was I standing to the fire bro?
---
Shadow priests can solo trib?
---
He obviously wasn't talking about a raid setting, they're wasted points in a raid setting.
---
yes thanks to mind soothe 
---
You just want more people on your private server, Nekky.
---
I just wish they could take a look at what Netherwing has done, introducing faction que to keep the balance good. 
---
Can you explain this in more detail please?
---
The sad thing is that between shot timing, pet management and possibly Raptor Strike weaving, hunters arguably have the most engaging PvE rotation out of all classes and specs in the game.
---
but you have some history with MMORPGs, and with WOW in general, right?
---
My plan if I can be around for launch is to level skinning and powerlevel like mad to try to skin enough before people camp them too much, and as a backup just farm gold and buy them. Who knows though, it might be the case that a few weeks after launch they end up being relatively uncontested. 
---
You cant really compare the two in the way you just did, sure classic will always be the "best" expansion imo. BUT tbc has its own flavor and i would say the raiding in TBC has more variation all the way from karazhan &gt; gruul &gt; ssc &gt; tk &gt; sunwell to it. I like them both equally much
---
There are words that have evolved meanings over time, but other words haven't. You were misusing a word.
---
Still....its good practice, something to do untill vanilla AND servers still going to be up after classic wich gives u more raiding options and some rest from the natural grind in vanilla. PLUS they are doing the patch cycle and transfering in to WOTLK later after a couple of years
---
If you make a habit of abusing sheep like that then yes, you will absolutely get banned. 
---
Simplistic have evolved Into having the same meaning as minimalistic, when talking about WoW addons. The same way One shot is used to describe getting killed in globals or very quickly in many gaming communities.
---
All I can say is that there are a ton of us who are thrilled that Nost did do Vanilla so damn well, that they did create such an outcry for the old-school game that Blizz is now developing "You think you do, and you do" classic.
---
There are times, though, that I do wish Nost hadn't given up their work.  You could log into Nost at any time and get an AV game, get a group for a dungeon, work on your trade skills and *mostly* sell them as it had such a vibrant, welcoming and fun-loving community.  Yeah, it had it's shit-talkers, but mostly what you found there was a love of the game.  
---
And man, do I miss those rainy afternoons when all of my 'adulting' for this real world is done, what I wouldn't do to log in and just play.  Just play.  Just log in, and then decide what I wanted to do in the vast world of WoW that Nost and it's dev's gave us.
---
I would be concerned that the animations and models would alter the way interactions happen with the environment other than what happened in vanilla.
---
Ah, the days of yore. Tranq shot rotations, being the designated "puller" (geddon to garr's room for instance), kiting drakkisath, not being allowed to use a pet, doing the epic quest, getting your bow ruined because you missed a class call, feign death and drinking, having to lay traps out of combat...  
---
Playing vanilla hunter was truly a game within the game.
---
Same! 
---
I think it was only the Arcanist set that I saw a mage in but once I did I was like "I'm getting in that guild with this guy".
---
Eventually did and through some great raid leadership we ended up getting server firsts in AQ and Naxx.
---
I keep hearing that servers are planning to transfer to the next expansion after however much time, but has one actually done it yet? 
---
Resto Druid.
---
That is such a sick tune... Love Pendulum.
---
Not hard for Blizzard. If it saves them money they will probably do it.
---
Im guessing you never tried to level on an overpopylated server 
---
It was in Vanilla, it is on private servers...so, I don't see why it won't be the same in Classic.
---
# Missing stuff I think you should add:
---
* Your guide does not mention the hidden path to rachet -&gt; camp t -&gt; thunder bluff that takes less than 10 minutes &amp; gets you to nearly level 3. 
---
* A section discussing bank alts and why they are important (infinite storage, AH access, etc.)
---
* Personal opinion, but I really hate the lack of dungeon information.
---
# Other stuff:
---
&gt;Only spend money to level:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Corruption  
---
&gt;Curse of Agony,  
---
&gt;Siphon Life  
---
&gt;Lifetap  
---
&gt;Shadowbolt  
---
&gt;Demon armor  
---
&gt;Soul stone  
---
&gt;Health stone  
---
&gt;Void Walker  
---
&gt;Consider for utility:
---
What about fear and death coil? At least rank 1 fear to help w/ chain pulls. Also, shouldn't you level your imps skills for possible group play and at least train rank 1 seduction on succy for wpvp? COE?
---
&gt;Joana is the best
---
You should add a link to VanillaGuide addon near your Johanna mention, since that's the guide it follows.
---
&gt;Leveling shopping list
---
This was cute and I get it from a minmaxing standpoint but really, **this section would be better suited to just be stressing that you have a bank alt parked @ a city for the infinite storage via mailbox &amp; easy switch to use AH. (Mail is instant between your characters.) This needs its own section because it saves so much time IMO.**
---
&gt; Remove helmet from being shown so people don’t know when/if you’re wearing engineering hats. 
---
TBH I never even considered this. This is big brain tactics and I have taken note.
---
&gt;\[don’t rebind r, used for whispers\]
---
Pleb status, real men type /r! /s
---
&gt;Get skinning (to vendor)  
---
&gt;Get mining
---
Skinning, agree 100%. Mining might be sketch for a fresh server. Perhaps you should discuss alternatives, especially for a fresh server. Engineering is extremely helpful while leveling but far from necessary. Enchanting and tailoring both level organically with your character and you always have the option of buying materials to level engineering later. It's really preference. I, like you, prefer to level with engineering but some people may not feel that way. It is important to talk about alternatives when it comes to things like this because it can turn people off from the guide. Just my two cents.
---
&gt;Skip buying curse of recklessness, searing pain, rain of fire
---
I know you skip dungeons but you should mention that if you do plan on doing dungeons you might want to train rain of fire. I know the DPS isn't that good but it's an AoE nonetheless.
---
&gt; Rotation 1
---
This is just from my experience, this rotation will draw aggro to you almost every time because of immolate. Immolate is almost not worth casting at this level, especially if you are apt to chain pull. I prefer to open with Curse of Agony due to the ramp up time, send voidwalker to meet mob halfway, corruption and then wand. Your wand does ridiculous damage at this level and this will let your mana regen ramp up towards the end of combat and save on life taps. Again, just my two cents - your rotation is fine but IMO immolate is just not worth it when your wand can do the same in two taps.
---
&gt;10 - 11: Imp Corruption (2/5)
---
Are you not maxing this just because of GCD? I'm just curious. I think it's fine but on any realm where wPvP is a possibility you might want to max this out. I don't know, it just feels better to me when it's instant. 
---
&gt;get succubus for stone quest Or wait until Mount @40?
---
Another reason I do all my running at level 1. You can knock out a lot of these quests without wasting too much time. Valley of Trials -&gt; Rachet -&gt; X-roads -&gt; Camp T -&gt; Thunder Bluff -&gt; Fly to Org -&gt; Zep to UC -&gt; UC flight path -&gt; Sepulcher -&gt; Run to Tarren Mill (Yes I do this at level 3. If you know where the horde graveyards are you know why this is easy.)
---
Again, I think the succy is very much worth getting for seduction.
---
&gt; The staff will eventually be replaced, the trinket has no substitute and is useful forever (including TBC) 
---
No mana or soul-shard for a Voidwalker is far from useful at this point. If it made the spell instant I might be inclined to agree with you, but this debate is really never ending. I will always take Soul Harvester on a fresh server. It will last you until a good MH+AV exalted or a Jindoo. Plus, it looks cool and hit rating is kind of hard to come by at this point in the game. Again, this is a never ending debate but just my two cents. :) Honestly, the robes aren't too bad either.
---
The word changed meanings, but only in exactly the World of Warcraft subscene of UI customization?
---
And then rather than thinking, "Hey, we are probably confusing simple and simplistic because we are a bubble of high school boys" the users think 
---
"No, this is definitely the right way to use that word, and we need to get super defensive and butthurt if anybody gets confused by the meaningless addition of 'istic' which in normal context WOULD change the meaning, but this is in the context of World of Warcraft UI optimization, so it means something different."
---
No it has not yet since the server im talking about opened a couple of days ago. But they have it in the timeline. First all expansions in the current patch then u can copy character to new realm with new patch and u keep the char on old server aswell
---
For the talents, I'm still not sure what's objectively the best – to rush drain soul or rush improved VW. I disagree going nightfall directly if solo because improved VW is just too big of a bonus to give up.
---
I want classic gameplay/difficulty but I'm on with graphics improvements. 
---
 I'm just gonna pop my popcorn and watch.
---
Nice! I'm still on the fence between Undead and Orc because I know I \*should\* roll Orc for Hardiness, but I think Undead look way better aesthetically in robes and with Warlock mount.
---
Have you found any information regarding PvP specific stat priorities?
---
Also, have you tried or considered adding a Dark Pact leveling spec to the guide? It does pretty well from 1-39 where you use the standard VW strat, and then really kicks into gear at 40+ when you can start drain tanking mobs and using your pet as a mana battery, as well as very efficient and sturdy sense you can use your pet to tank 1 mob, drain tank another, and fear kite another at the same time. It may be worth a mention.
---
Thanks for sharing all your hard work!
---
That's definitely the intended strat, but that little strip was deemed to be safe, so we built our strat around that.
---
I'll be going Nelf Hunter as well. If you start a discord channel or anything like that, hit me up.
---
This will mess with the economy too much for my liking, a server of two out of the 10 (for example) gets a bit more lucky on rare drops and the economy looks quite different. Also if you get on the less populated server and have a gathering profession you’ll have a big leg up on somebody who’s on the more popular sever prior to the merge. I hate sharding but would rather that in the 1-10 zone than this 
---
Opinions on race, want to roll Shaman and hunter, both female Orc and Troll. I feel the troll fits better (sparky colors) on the shaman and the more serious-focused orc for the hunter. Don't care much about ratials. Any opinions?
---
Video version of MoV #11 is up, just fyi! [https://youtu.be/fscgExPBAFA](https://youtu.be/fscgExPBAFA)
---
&gt; PvP specific stat priorities
---
It depends on your spec, but generally stamina is a LOT more important than pve.
---
Ah I see now, you are missing a line for levels 22-24 where it would say improved VW, nevermind.
---
Honestly they should just implement first name/last name system and make it unique across region. Problem solved.
---
Dont want to be the bad guy here but nothing we will provide or suggest in that regards will change anything. 
---
Blizzard has their plans for server architecture and they wont give a damn about what we think. 
---
I hope the best for classic and have many wishes regardings it's release but we wont change blizzards mindset regarding servers as they most likely go the easiest and most stable way
---
Even with an absolutely absurd amount of hyperbole I refuse to believe you can actually convince anyone this is an actual issue. 
---
This is the staff you want: http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Living_Root
---
Both servers would have to be low population to be eligible for a merge.
---
Yeh easy. 2H Sword. Ranged weapon enables ez mode so screw that also fuck pets eat all my food.
---
Just need me and my katana. Mongoose slicer, raptor smash, traps. That wat it mean 2 be survival
---
oops, must have deleted that line by accident. xD
---
I feel the same but I don't want ppl to throw rocks at me :). We could use that graphical update as long as it's just the graphics. I think that animations and spell effects are part of the class/race immersion. For example when I choose a race for a spellcaster, I always consider the animations of that certain race, because i want it to "look cool" and I will be probably be stuck with that choice for some time.
---
Double checked, vanilla stats are comparable so yeah, it sounds odd but these are two of the highest dps weapons at that stage for warriors.
---
That's an interesting path for the level 1 running- where do you set hearth at the end once you get to Tarren Mill?  Are you like.. level 3 or 4 by the time you get to TM as well from all the discovery xp?
---
There is 3 Raid UIs wtf is this! Please explain to someone who didn't raid back then.
---
Certainly more than spamming shadowbolts. I hear a lot of people saying that feral druids need a buff or retris need fixing. If anything it's the hunters who need fixing because the druids and paladins can at least heal, hunters fail at their only role which really fucking sucks.
---
In the guide I linked, there is pretty nice spreadsheet for shaman healing spells.

(Incase u missed it)

I just hearth back to Valley of Trials normally, or if I'm feeling saucy I will occasionally take the extra time to trek to Deathknell or Red Cloud Mesa. Depends on my class/mood lol.
---
&gt; The word changed meanings, but only in exactly the World of Warcraft subscene of UI customization? 
---
It's used differently, based on the community. The very same reason that 'One shot' in League of Legends is widely used to just describe a lot of burst damage. Do you go into those conversations and tell them they're using the wrong word as well, even though it's generally accepted by the community, that you can refer to burst damage with One shot?
---
&gt;And then rather than thinking, "Hey, we are probably confusing simple and simplistic because we are a bubble of high school boys" the users think  
---
&gt;"No, this is definitely the right way to use that word, and we need to get super defensive and butthurt if anybody gets confused by the meaningless addition of 'istic' which in normal context WOULD change the meaning, but this is in the context of World of Warcraft UI optimization, so it means something different."
---
Obviously I am going to defend the use of the word and if it should be taken literal or not, given the context. I don't think defending my opinion is me being butthurt, if anything, I think going into a comment section, what looks like just to point out what you think are mistakes, to be more the showcase of being butthurt.
---
I meant death wish. Don't dual wield at low lvl. Death wish with the ww axe and watch ppl mealt 
---
I play Alliance but am having the same dilemma between Gnome and Human Warlock. I *know* Gnome is better because of the Int boost, but I just love the look of a Human caster so much more.
---
Absolutely outstanding: Thorough, well-argued, and clear.  Kudos to you my friend!
---
Your guild is hardly casual if you are clearing MC/BWL/Ony in only 2-3 hours. 
---
There was a TBC vid of this guy exploring out of bounds Kharazan instance. He had it synced so the big drop when he jumped off the railing and Ill never forget it. Coolest dang video
---
Ghostsabber for the look
---
Pugs aren't going to be half as common in classic as they are on 10k pservers I'm afraid. 
---
For me its the opposite i hate it. If you want to use an ability on someone else you should have to target them and use it not have a amacro that auto casts on your focus. It just dumbs down combat.
---
Some of the new animations travel at different speeds. Many spells travel faster now or even instantly striking the enemy, instead of reaching the target in one second from 30 yards away. This will affect how people time their pulls.
---
So this is connected realms or whatever it’s called in retail? Doesn’t everyone hate that 
---
1.12 is the most complete, but they're choosing not to release it completely at first by timegating content
---
the game will survive without any changes, but they're going to change the game 3 times by timegating content
---
they're contradicting themselves
---
But how it's different from sharding? It's basically the same thing as having just a handful of servers with sharding on.
---
Cool- are you around level 4 or 5 or is it higher?
---
Well i'm sure that would be an easy fix. I was asking from the purely visual point of view.
---
I usually do your place in the world before I leave so I'm level 2, then by the time I'm done walking I'm usually 3 to 5 depending how many landmarks I discovered. Typically, I do quests to level 6 in the starting zone and then carry on to Razor Hill/Echo Isles.
---
Honestly I don't see it happening. They seem pretty fixed on keeping the graphics to vanilla graphics. Maybe there will be some minor things due to the engine they're using. They confirmed will be using the old models, and using spell animations from 2018 with character models from 2004 will look rather silly.
---
Personally I'm not against using all the modern animations, models and graphics, but a large portion of this subreddit are flat out against it, even if it's a switch you can turn on and off.
---
Maybe long after launch they'll do something, but there's a lot to transpire between now and then, what the community wants and what the development team can deliver.
---
Classic models will be an improvement over BFA models.
---
That would be fucking horrific. I loved the classic animations and loathe the new system. I played the demo and one of the main things I was looking at was the animations. I hope they fix stealth.
---
Yeah lol. There are no mandatory quests like this in vanilla. Anytime you see a line formed for something like this, just skip it. Farming mobs will be faster EXP gain than waiting there.
---
I hate pfUI, looks like absolute trash and is way too limited in its customization.
---
Yeah I don't see it happening either. They want to keep it as low cost as possible, and players wanting to keep it original just plays in their favor
---
Ok, I’m genuinely curious. What does sharding mean to you? Most people seem to, incorrectly, equate it to Cross Realm Zones or phasing to artificially limit populations per area. What the OP, or what I believe they mean, is getting at is the opposite of a free transfer to a low pop server. 
---
Once two servers, Anvilmar and Anub’Arak, fall below what would constitute a healthy population, the world server of the two realms merge into Anvil’Arak. You still have toons, in the Realm list, on Anvilmar and your new buddy has his on Anub’Arak, but they exist on the same World Server forever now. This would allow people to keep their server identity and keep servers in a healthy population range. No phasing, no people skipping out of existence, no change in gameplay.
---
How is this anything but a win?
---
I don’t recall seeing complaints about connected realms, it’s Cross Realm Zones that everyone has issues with from my understanding.
---
If you are making a NE Hunter, here are some ideas for names: Legolos, Legalas, Leetolas, Leegoolas, Legolaas, Legomyeggolas, Kevin.
---
no, as the new animations and spells look incredibly dorky and WEAK compared to the original versions
---
This is why I'll never main a warrior :(
---
Mind soothe is a priest only ability that lessens the field of aggro an enemy humanoid would have. Druids have a similar spell that work on beasts.
---
Uhh can i have access to that one? Im curious :P
---
That top xmog is sick af holy crap
---
The newer tiers look cool but they have so much going on. 
---
I would flip them. Shaman orc, hunter troll.
---
Mainly due to racials tho. Looks pretty even when/if in tier gear. Slightly favour orc shaman myself.
---
Can confirm
---
This is what I thought too, but then I was reminded that every class looks like shit anyways 
---
That sounds good. Today many people enjoy their games in wqhd or even uhd...
---
Not exactly.  From what I've seen you have people walking around as Xeonisius-Laughing Skull and Gleb2006-Mal'ganis.  This would prevent oddities such as that.  The server names still exist as Laughing Skull and Mal'ganis.  Your character name still remains Gleb2006.  Your guild name still remains the same as well.
---
Okay but how does kiting Gordon work with no aspect?
---
I guess I'll believe it when i see it.
---
Your intended point is somewhat undercut by how badass the top transmog is. 
---
Soda said he will play on a pvp realm
---
except horde warlocks. 
---
No dude... He is obviously balance
---
Yeah if it was a lame looking but top rated gear set, point made.
---
But this just makes me think you don’t like dark souls lookin gear
---
The video is of a post-cata Descolace though... ?
---
I’ve done a couple videos/streams with Tips and the ClassiCast guys. I wouldn’t be opposed to doing more in the future if the desire is there but a text based AMA will give more people the opportunity to ask questions and at least let their question be seen.
---
&gt; Are you not maxing this just because of GCD? 
---
Not maxing it is indeed due to the global cooldown! (GCD).
---
Fear and deathcoil, definitely agree with you and updated.
---
Succubus/Dungeons I think are too situational for my current plan of solo play and avoiding wpvp on my way to 60. Certainly can be viable.
---
If you PM me your email I'll give you suggestion/comment rights. Would love to include your considerations!
---
when everything looks awesome then nothing does.
---
item design died for me when they decided to make everything glow.
---
Exhibit A: Tacky over-the-top
---
Exhibit B: literal clown
---
I’m so glad I have no idea what xmog is..... f*** Retail
---
I know all the vanilla heads want Classic to remain unchanged, but comparisons like this make me wish for Classic to come with all the old items and sets re imagined with the current WoW art "style"
---
Also how to handle servers merging?
---
Because it is

---
That is Pure Love
---
Well, you don't have a lot of option:
---
1.Grind till 20
---
2. Go to Loch Modan - bright green zone with a handful of quests.
---
3. Or go to Darkshore - a gloomy elven zone with a lot of quests.
---
If You choose Darkshore, be advised that You'll die a lot while running through Wetlands.
---
current wow style meaning literally no color ever. Just brown brown and more brown.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/uldir-armor-weapons-models
---
look at how bad that is
---
Bottom set is litty asf.
---
Top is over-the-top. Like ”evil mega badguy dangerous fire scary black plate orc big hammer”, a real snooze on that one
---
I never did mind, but to each their own. There is a type of bear in Elwynn Forest that has a super slow attack speed of 2.8 or something. I'd have to verify. Not likely to be tamed though, since it's exclusively in a human zone.
---
I can't think of any advantage a slower attack speed would have on a pet.
---
Glorious 
---
Pfff Peggle you scrub
---
You see badass, I see silly. That mace would weigh more than the person (including the armor). Soon WoW maces will be cars on sticks.
---
Don't forget the all-time classic, XxLegolasxx.
---
And yet for some reason DM is the least popular level 60 dungeon on private servers -- no one wants to run it.
---
I get your point, I much preferred class set's as opposed to what they are doing with the raid gear now. But some people actually really liked the change, because they were looking for more "realistic" less flashy armours, not  saying that must mean it should be devoid of colour 
---
I honestly prefer old ironforge ahead of current undercity in terms of layout, regardless of what you do in undercity you will find yourself at the wrong quest/vendor location.
---
Where'd you get the template where her hair is not white?
---
And Night Elf Druids
---
Yeah, the sanguicell and hydrocore type mats really don't count in my opinion.... I have so many sanguicells I don't even know what to do with them they are practically useless to me and I have two crafting professions.
---
Private servers do a horrible version of progressive itemization.  Every item that was added in 1.4 is removed from MC, but the items that were original mixed into MC (t2) is not re-added because no one has the exact drop tables.
---
lionheart helm yaYEET
---
Cthun gloves. R a r e
---
Paladins look really good for one set and rogues have some solid sets too
---
I hope i get in fast enough to get ZappyBoi for my female paladin.
---
That top pic looks so fucking trash lmao
---
PFUi ain't bad
---
Tauri has gone vanilla - mop so far
---
Hah yeah I’m almost tempted to run priest also. But then I’m almost sure I’ll stay with mage for that aoe and mobility!
---
All that mess to cast healing touch and innervate. Oof
---
Strongly considering having hunter by my first char.. I played on a bit but not too much in Vanilla.  I won't have a ton of time to play, so being able to be a top-tier solo'er and leveler (and also nice in wpvp) is appealing.  
---
Easy to be a huntard, but the skill cap is high!  Made a hunter on an instant 60 server and am trying to relearn, watching those around me and trying to emulate.  Have pulled off a few great plays, but definitely been embarassed a few times as well. 
---
Thought the Orc Racial was a Frog
---
Thought the Troll Racial was a Goblin
---
Thought Hunters Mark was a clown
---
than it must be a bug, because even wiki says: (At the level cap, "green" or higher targets are still considered to "yield" experience, even if no experienced is actually gained, so they will still proc Spirit Tap.)
---
Or maybe i played on the buggiest of servers...
---
Oh cool, i hadnt heard of that server. Did they mirror characters every expansion release? Or progress the current realms to the new expansions?
---
I honestly couldn't give a fuck. I stare at raid frames all day.
---
It had to pass the various forum censors after all...
---
You mean Levin?
---
It's all about reading the Matrix :D
---
bottom looks impractical technically and like garbage visually , but its forbidden to remove the pink glasses on this subreddit, so yea.. ahem, vanilla was better!
---
Yeetgolas
---
I hate this argument. This is a fantasy game and that’s a super strong fictional green creature. But you want realistic looking weapons? 
---
The problem is that if I want to play a certain name, now I go through a bunch of servers and the name is taken because of one server.
---
what happens with duplicate character names?
---
Depends on what your focus is. Troll is solid for pve, but imo it is the worst hunter class in the game for pvp.
---
My issue with BC servers is the ones I've found skip over the classic content.
---
There's the druid buff if you're counting class buffs. Mark of the Wild (rank 6).  
---
Increases the friendly target's armor by 240, all attributes by 10 and all resistances by 15 for 30 minutes.
---
Who cares. Change it up. Server mergers are inevitable due to the explosion in playerbase on day #1 and the total implosion after a certain time due to tourists and those whose nostalgia has been fullfilled leaving again (completely natural, but it will be much more of a peak and bottom than normal releases)
---
Sure, then again, in that regard Vanilla also already had over the top weapons. Especially some 2 hand swords.
---
I want weapons that look good with animation. In my opinion, humanoid forms just look bad wielding weapons that are overly cumbersome, unless the character was designed specifically to handle huge weapons (think Cloud from FF7). Otherwise, models designed for a wide range of weapon sizes look ridiculous with their generic animations.
---
Whoever got a paladin to R14 is a hero, and will be forever echoed into the canyons of time.
---
As I understand it, shard is a separate instance of a server (not an existing server) that can be booted of shut down depending on the load. So basically, server with sharding is like a server without hard population cap.
---
Did you just actually forget The Prodigy, Godsmack, Rammstein, Disturbed, Fort Minor and The Matrix trilogy OST?!?!
---
Isn't it not only solid in PvE but also the strongest in endgame PvE due to the +5 hit and therefore giving troll hunters highest dps potential? BiS weapons are bows after all.
---
Wait, this is actually a post asking for Cross Realm features in Classic? Wow.....
---
Smashy boi vs Pokey boi
---
You aren't hitting R14 by logging in a couple times a week.
---
Yeah, because something like Arcanite Reaper in vanilla would have been so much more practical for someone to wield. /s
---
Not bringing much to groups? Hunters can CC 2 mobs (have pet tank one and ice trap) and stay nicely at a distance from melee effects all the while doing steady dps. Good hunters are a blessing to have is my opinion. Especially when their pet gets agro off a mob heading for me.
---
If you like to pvp at all, put in enough effort to get at least 2 pieces of the blue pvp gear. It has so much damn crit on it, and the 2 piece bonus of 20 agility makes it even better. Unless you have an entire tier 1 or 2 set, you should be able to fit 2 pieces in there somewhere.
---
Maybe on private servers you'd think it's desolate due to all the bots and spammers filling up slots. Just to consider
---
Yes it will, if you are on a fresh server where people are going to be constantly rolling new characters for a few weeks. Lets assume the server is capped at 3k, well there are 3 different starting zones for each faction. So thats roughly 500 players in each starting zone. But realistically because of racial imbalance you will have around 700-900 players in one zone and several hundred in each of the others, sure it will thin out over a few days but you will still end up with hundreds of players in the same zone for at least a week or two. I for one support sharding but only for the starting zones and only for a few weeks until the populations sort themselves out.
---
I also don't have a problem with 3k capped servers(honestly 3-5k is the sweet spot), but that will not fix the starting zone congestion that is going to happen.
---
How are duplicates supposed to happen? 
---
It's per zone so odds that strange people will pop up is 0 since you will never notice it. 
---
I played on most and many other private servers...I disagree I want the blizzlike cap. I hated large populations they had to increase spawn rates it sucked ..also constant PvP and you never saw the same people twice(exaggeration but I get the point)
---
Ok but it's vanilla can't really compare them. 2.5 was a design thing
---
I'd suggest actually reading the post first. 
---
The Blackrock set is pretty cool though. I can certainly think of better examples of overly flashy armor. 
---
Yes but it makes it faster and quicker...you don't need to interact with the players as much and it's FASTER to replace group members...leading to less of a shit given on your group members.
---
Nuts, right? 
---
True TBC added aliens from space....bad expansion imo
---
Nothing like an undead with the plagueheart set
---
I'll roll a Dwarf for that op stone skin and level with a boar for the charge ability and garbage disposal feeding option for them.
---
Once i get to high levels ill swap out to a owl and a wind serpent for these pet abilities.
---
Engineering will cost a lot but i'll be able to make my own guns and ammo and still get fun toys like the deep dive helm and the goblin jumper cables.
---
The solo farm power will be great late game and i don't really plan to raid so i can be cheap and just stay in BM farm mode all the time. 
---
Also never forget everything is hunter gear!!!
---
Yea most people just install addons because they think it looks cool and their favourite streamer has the same, without understanding of the purpose of those addons it seems like.
---
Either Loch Modan, Redridge, run a VC with all 5(?) quests, or just go to Darkshore.
---
What's with the capitalizing random words? Does is make it more EPIC to OWN those IDIOT retail players?
---
Here is a list I made after I saw some streamer farm warsong as a gnome mage:  
---
gyrofreeze ice reflector  
---
hyper-radiant flame reflector  
---
ultra-flash shadow reflector  
---
tidal charm  
---
Gnomish Net-o-Matic Projector  
---
Gnomish Cloaking Device  
---
skull of impending doom  
---
Furbolg Medicine Pouch  
---
goblin rocket boots  
---
gobling rocket helmet  
---
free action potion  
---
swiftness potion  
---
Invisibility Potion  
---
Magic Dust  
---
iron grenade
---
Yes it definitely is! I did it a lot on private servers, in guilds and pugs. But you should choose a dmg class
---
OP isn't claiming he is looking for a top end guild, even states he/she is fine with progressing a lot slower.
---
Good for you, I don't. That's not to say I didn't enjoy TBC, because I did, but just nowhere near as much.
---
Ooh ain’t that Fury post-raid BiS?
---
I had the same experience, ran out of Q's in Westfall and had to grind a bit.  I think it's because groups are so easy to find and do quests with, so you're getting a bit less XP than if you just solo'd everything. 
---
Grinding is always a safe bet.  Linen/Wool cloth is pretty rare and valuable.  I found a partner or two and grinded the gnolls in south Westfall (dense packs, quick respawns on the pserver I was on) for cloth/cash/greens.  Was relatively safe, there are a few open areas near the gnolls that either have no mobs or a lot of neutral ones so pretty easy to run/reset if it gets hairy. 
---
Otherwise, if you happen across a well-geared Warr looking to do deadmines or other similarly 'well geared' folks then you might as well get in there and hope for some good drops / easy XP.  The whole instance is a breeze up until the boat when some pulls can easily get a lot of adds.  Your Voidy can do serious work once you get to level 17/18 and if you took the improved VW talent.  Viable offtank!
---
It’s good, but I see it as a bonus due to it beikg out of my control
---
&gt;But some people actually really liked the change
---
Cool! They can keep playing their WoW while we will play ours then!
---
Private servers do not use the same terrain geometry compiler like retail. This is why private servers have many pathing issues with pets while retail Wow never had these issues. 
---
The original ones are way better. The new ones are goofy and ruins the immersion for me. No one moves like that except stage actors who are told to ironically overact. 
---
In PvP, the former image is quite applicable. Retribution is quite strong with good gear just like any other class.
---
This is the best solution to an inevitable population problem/server merge situation.
---
I  would love it if more MMOs had ESOs naming rules. 25 characters including spaces and apostrophes, whatever, independent of in game titles as well.. Want to be "Morgan Trevaine", the Breton Wizard? Of course! Turdaxe the Destructor? No problem. K'i'l'ath'an Fi'rebrand, haughty high elf archer. Done. Good luck getting people to mail you things, but done.   I've seen charming orc statesmen named Barak gro-Bama deliver rousing speeches at the stages  in Mournhold.
---
Love this thank you, was having trouble picking between warlock or mage. Guess I know what I'll go now. :)
---
You're right about the animations, they seem childish, but the spell effects are cool.
---
Don't you do leatherwork yourself if you pick skinning and engineering?
---
Haha it's an old JG Wentworth ad. I bet it's on youtube.
---
&gt;Isn't Cloud a small boy with a giant sword? How is he designed to handle the weapon?
---
Grind and then go to Redridge. 
---
It's a waste of time to go to Loch Modan unless your goal is to pick up flight paths on the way.
---
what differences in quality?
---
Sorry, this seems primarily about private servers. Please try r/wowservers for discussing how to play/how to play on Korean private servers or clients.
---
Thanks!
---
Exactly. 
---
FYI, there is a Hunter channel on the [r/classicwow Discord.](https://discord.gg/classicwow)
---
Will definitly role a NE (f) hunter again and again. Never made it to riding in vanilla, maybe this time.
---
I just love sneaking through the forrests of Teldrassil, Darkshore, Ashenvale, later Feralas - just hunting bears, wolves and other creatures with my nightsabber (or ghostsabber again for the look) for skins and meat.
---
Probably will go on a RP realm this time. 
---
Yeah man you also know what’s silly? Wings sprouting out of your back when you jump because you equipped a helm. Wearing detachable horns and getting stats for it. Looking like a clown.
---
Like what? Warcraft has always been silly, do you not remember the clown sets and exploding critters?
---
Both have their merits.
---
And u cant make horde and ally on diff servers in the same cluster?
---
I suppose it is because Invisibird said that Draenei **SEEM** to run slow. Like he probably knows that all characters run at the same speed. It is like you saying to a friend, "Look! This cloud looks like a dog!" And then a stranger comes out of nowhere and tells you something like "Actually, a cloud is made of water, while a dog is an animal that can walk and ...". Sure he is correct, but this is boring
---
I've never seen a compelling argument against merging servers. They are all either minor drawbacks (compared to dead servers/sharding/accelerated respawns/giant populations) or they have an easy solution, or they are based purely on conjecture (hurts economy, my server so unique).
---
What does casual mean to you, OP? Does it mean you can't reliably raid on a set schedule, or does it mean you don't have a lot of time outside of raiding to farm for gold/consumables? If it's the former, join a large social guild that raids and you'll get taken along every now and then for the first couple tiers. If it's the latter, join a good guild that won't wipe much (wipes dont just cost repair bills, its also a lot of gold in consumes), and get the consumes you need for a given tier waaaaaay beforehand while theyre cheap. For example, elemental earth and waters before AQ and Naxx cause the prices to spike.
---
I've played a little in WoTLK. A few weeks after I started playing Cata dropped. I played a little and didn't like it. So I stopped.
---
Then I played some on private servers. The most in WoTLK, run a few dungeons. And I leveled a Paladin to 1x in Vanilla, run Deadmines. :)
---
I've played other MMOs since, but never raided. I've played SWTOR the most, I've run all the story Flashpoints with my girlfriend.
---
I'm really looking forward to Classic. I've even started a guild (which is coming along nicely :).
---
The most sexy moustache in the world.
---
Wait, people don’t hate Nostalrius anymore? I feel like I’m severely out of the loop.
---
I remember 1-2 years ago when Elysium was only a few months old and suddenly the Nostalrius team told Elysium they should shut down their servers because Blizzard doesn’t want Elysium to, well, exist.
---
It was a *huge* drama and every single place was filled with Nost hate wether you were there on Elysium or on Twitter, Reddit, even YouTube had lots of negative comments because everyone thought Nost had backstabbed the private server community. What happened since?
---
Cloud strife doesn’t look off in Smash Ultimate. Also we had swords almost as big as his. There’s a 7ft Zweihander.
---
It was made recently and posted on this subreddit.
---
**Vanilla**: good color palette; bad textures and a little flat
---
**BfA**: awful, boring color palette; well textured 3D models
---
**Optimal**: good color palette; well textured 3D models
---
**Classic**: No changes
---
I really liked the 1.1 talent trees for Retribution. It had BoK, which meant a reason to bring Retribution Paladins to raid. It was a good idea, even though in the end they would be relegated to healing anyways.
---
But pugs were still a thing back then. I remember pretty varied pug groups to MC, and semi-pugs to BWL on my server - this was before Naxx and the server wasn't a very progressed one at all! 
---
Pvp servers are overrated. You might get a few fun times fighting open world but it is eclipsed by griefers and gankers. The only appeal is that youll one day be able to be the asshole.
---
&gt; I've played a little in WoTLK. A few weeks after I started playing, Cata dropped. I played a little and didn't like it. So I stopped.
---
so patch 4.0.1 to 4.0.3a, right? Or you played before 4.0?
---
&gt; I'm really looking forward to Classic. I've even started a guild (which is coming along nicely :).
---
Well, I have already my race, class, appearance and name planned, and it has been my plan for months and hasn't changed, so I guess I'm already settled with that, and let's hope that nobody ninja's my name.
---
ITT: Nobody realizes that the Emperor knows the Yuuzhan Vong are coming and everything he's doing is to harden us so that we will be prepared.
---
Not a bad idea. And if servers don’t drop to low pop they can just be moved out of the cluster to free up the names.
---
I too am wondering this. Ironically, my school Mac is more powerful than my laptop.
---
Almost every other class has the ability to CC, and bring a lot of other stuff too. 
---
Locks bring health stones,and summon stones.
---
Mages bring buffs and food
---
Rogues have the highest single target dps.
---
etc etc.
---
CC is great but when the rest of the group is providing buffs, food and summons on top of their CC, what do you need a Hunter for? 
---
I'm inclined to agree with you re: Soul Harvester vs Trinket.  +Hit is hard to come by and the Scythe is such a cool and unique item, tough to pass up.  Where the Trinket could be interesting is for Solo play, wPvP and BGs.  If you're in a pinch and Sacrifice one of your demons, or they get killed, having Fel Domination and Master Summoner make this near instant cast.  Probably up to your play style and end-game goals but the trinket seems to be very situational at that level.  My .02.  Thoughts?
---
I have my rogue Xmogged to look as tacky as possible in Retail. It’s the best. 
---
I’m kind of excited for no more xmog though. 
---
On the real, I always loved how the AQ plate set looked. Plus you knew they were about to hit like a Mack truck if they had it.
---
The main argument I’ve seen is some having to change their name, but the OP’s suggestion solves that, albeit at the cost of potentially having more competition for some names.
---
I never swapped, I think I had like HOJ and the Garona's Trinket all the time. Had no DKP for the DFT. :(
---
Idk if there is even a trinket worth swapping out as a Rogue.
---
The biggest burst abilities are AR and BR for a Rogue, you know AR 5 min CD and Vanish had like 5-6? It was certainly always ready with AR.
---
So you actually completely negate the danger of your burst damage, because you can Vanish and have no aggro at all. 
---
I noticed with the casual Guild I raided on a P-SERVER, that there was no real strategy expect for the Healers and the Tanks. 
---
The Raidlead told the DDs where to stand and what to kill first. But back in the day our rule of thumb was that EVERYONE would use their big CD at 10-15% of the Boss-Health. Our Raid-Lead would give the command and we would burst that MOFO down.
---
And at this stage of the fight, the Tanks would have enough aggro. IF you feel like you are in danger as a Rogue, you just Vanish.
---
Everyone was on the same page, so I don't see any scenario where you would need Salvation as a Rogue.
---
Different Story for Warrior. I think they have a much harder time on Horde side, without salvation, without a doubt.
---
I honestly can't remember a Rogue asking me when I was testing Paladin on a P-Server, if they could have Salvation, but I HAD to do it for Furies. They would straight up die, even with a Thunderfury Tank.
---
That is not what the OP is suggesting, though.
---
I agree with you and I will likely be taking Soul Harvester when I level my Warlock, especially if ZG is not released. The trinket is just too situational (at all levels really) and has a 30 minute cooldown. I mean, a free soul shard every 30 minutes? Neat, but nothing to gawk at imo. When are you in such a pinch that you have no soul shards &amp; low mana? Few &amp; far between.
---
Plus, Soul Harvester looks cool.
---
But this picture is from a realm with 12k+ players.
---
Cloud was designed specifically to hold giant swords, so that is factored into his animation. For example, just look at his stance-- feet wide apart, moving center of gravity away from the giant blade. Now look at the WoW stance while casually holding a 500 pound weapon with one hand. The character should be fallen over on their face. Not to mention that lack of collision detection becomes ever more silly with larger weapons; when is a giant weapon with one-animation-fits-all ever NOT partially inside the body of its wielder?
---
No, cross-Realm means you have players from other servers sharing the same world.
---
Not at all! Work kept me from writing all of the classics.
---
Can't also forget about hammer fall or puddle of mud or pod!
---
No idea about the patch. My memory is a bit fuzzy but I remember that one day I logged in and talents were somewhat changed? And I was aware that a new expansion was released and the old world was changed. My char was in Northrend at that time. I've created another and started to level up in the new zones and then I was really disappointed. It was flashy with the effects and new quests but overall irritating and not really fun. It was much worse than what I've remembered from my previous char. I don't know how long I've played. I've seen a few zones for sure but I stopped pretty soon.
---
Fortunately I don't care what name my char will have (I've the race/class planned, Human Warrior tank). I also don't really care about his appearance. I'll pick something which looks good and that's that. In any case good luck with your char. :)
---
I care
---
Eh it’s WoW shits always silly. I would like 2h animations to be more realistic though. Like a lot, such as Zweihander should be able to be used like spears and used for like zoning archs.
---
Though I don’t think Blizzard will ever fix clipping or make non silly but epic animations.
---
If they are optional and do not mess up the original animations for those who prefer to use those, sure. Details like projectile travel speeds would also have to be brought in line with the original effects.
---
Well, not all of MaNGOS are squatting Adidas hipsters, some of us were just plain old guys with families and a hobby. But not the point, my question stands.
---
Does ragtag even have a lot of viewers? I thought everyone abandoned him after his guild drama. Especially now that his fanbase is 90% overwatch players.
---
I don't understand. You used the GPL, if you thought that licence was inappropriate then you should've chosen another one.
---
When I was horde warlock, I used the -80% threat trinket form AQ40 for some fights, best warriors in my guild used it too
---
&gt; that one day I logged in and talents were somewhat changed?
---
You mean when you started, there were already those new classes, and all the talent trees were shown on the same tab, right? But, when you started, the world wasn't changed yet by the cataclysm?
---
yes
---
Which mod, if removed from r/Classicwow, would be the easiest to replace/go without?
---
jk
---
Not the point. The point was the part where people pretended to have done everything on their own, when it actually was ten years of hundreds of peoples lives and a tiny bit of their own. That is why my questions says "feel".
---
Shamans and pallies are very different, but horde get by fine without pallies and alliance gets by fine without shamans. I feel like that makes that case for pallies and shamans being tied for easiest to replace or go without. My gut tells me it's druid though because I'd rather have a pally along than a druid in both PVE and PVP.
---
I would say it depends on whether you're talking PvP or PvE.
---
Hunter /thread
---
Those aren’t even his own videos. You hate someone you obviously know jack shit about lol.

I have this in fav, if you search you should find others
---
Health pools are smaller, and pvp is more about blowing people up
---
was also my thought. i will play rogue nevertheless :P you can replace him with any other (good) dd class and dont really lose buffs
---
Hi, /u/cooplooper
---
That doesn't look anything like dark souls gear... 
---
I would have to disagree with you on pallies and shamans simply because both factions still have that roll filled. If you removed paladins from alliance and did not give them shamans or vice versa, it would be at a greater detriment to the game than to simply remove druids.
---
Wait, people don’t hate the Nost team anymore? I feel like I’m severely out of the loop.
---
I remember 1-2 years ago when Nost’s successor (the one that starts with an E)  was only a few months old and suddenly the Nost team told E they should shut down their servers because Blizzard doesn’t want E to, well, exist.
---
It was a huge drama and every single place was filled with Nost hate wether you were there on E or on Twitter, Reddit, even YouTube had lots of negative comments because everyone thought Nost had backstabbed the private server community. But I quit vanilla a few weeks later so I haven’t kept up. What happened since?
---
Edit: Wow, my comment gets removed because I mention a private server in a post about private servers? How does that make any sense?
---
Instead of aswering your question, I'll just like you to a Druid PvP video of the new vanilla era (pservers). Watch what they can do with our current knowledge of the game:
---
https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
Of course mages are better, but Druids are a blast to play!
---
Without tranq shot, some mechanics are impossible or very difficult. Hunters literally are only good for tranq shot, viper sting, and their cc and kiting
---
OP never saw this comment it seems. &gt;_&gt;
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ad43md/excuse_me_this_is_classic/eddumz0/
---
Hunters are the easiest to live without in most situations
---
Blizzard knows that. Who cares about the rest of the public? They are like sheep.
---
Locks can, but among the several classes that can farm lasher (druids, pallies, priests, mages) warlocks are not in the top two in terms of speed or safety.
---
Assuming blues and greens as you wrote, it's hard to avoid running out of shards eventually. Either you sac void on each pull, or you risk dying to bad luck shadow damage spikes from the lashers. Leaving a lasher alive to drain soul is hit-or-miss, especially if you have to sac void. Additionally when in blues/greens you have to use a wonky destro spec with buffed AOE fire damage + stun that isn't useful for anything else in the game but lasher farm.

Warriors:

1) Give Paladins the Warrior's protection tree and skills. Win-win.

2) Rogues already fill the Fury DPS role

3) Improve Ret Paladins and give them the Arms DPS Role/skills.
---
Not my point. It says AMA, my question was serious. I'm not the character type to do something like this, so my question is sincere.
---
Ugh, I really don't remember that. When started it was still WoTLK, old world, old quests.
---
The new expansion was released and it was a big deal. So I started a new character. I vaguely remember marveling at the new talents? But if it was a new char how did I know the talents were new? :) If I checked my chars on my account and the release notes of the patches around Cata release I might work out what happened in more detail but I don't think it's that interesting. :)
---
Well, it is compiling, then using the database. And then people just download the same stuff and install it. In my line of work this is like a coffee break with two cups of coffee. Not the big deal all servers make out of it.
---
Duh, by being in full naxx DPS gear with multiple world buffs.

&gt;WOW CLASSIC: FIRST PROTOTYPE        
---
&gt;The first—and among the most important—decision we had to make was which version of the game to focus on. As many of you have noted, the classic period was two years long and full of changes. Core features like Battlegrounds were introduced in patches after WoW’s original launch, and class design similarly changed over time. After careful consideration, we decided on Patch 1.12: Drums of War as our foundation, because it represents the most complete version of the classic experience.
---
&gt;Once we had our starting point, we began taking stock of what we had in the source code and what we could make available, which included restoring the original development database from archival backups. After stitching various key pieces together, we had a locally rebuilt version of Patch 1.12 running internally. The team could create characters and do basic questing and leveling—and dying, which we did many times. For testing purposes. Obviously.
---
&gt;Our initial runs exposed a few (expected) issues: the game sometimes crashed, didn’t recognize our modern video cards, and was incompatible with our current login system. That first pass also couldn’t support any of our modern security and anti-cheating capabilities. Clearly we had a lot of work to do to make WoW Classic live up to the Blizzard standard of quality, and deliver the experience players want.
---
&gt;THE PATH FORWARD: SECOND PROTOTYPE      
---
&gt;Speaking of engineering, World of Warcraft is a very data-driven game, which means the basic code is flexible and the specific way it behaves is controlled by information contained in databases. Things like quests, monsters, items, and the rules for how these all interact are defined by the designers and artists in data.
---
&gt;So we asked ourselves, would it still be possible to deliver an authentic classic experience if we took our modern code, with all its back-end improvements and changes, and used it to process the Patch 1.12 game data? While that might seem counterintuitive, this would inherently include classic systems like skill ranks, old quests and terrain, talents, and so on, while later features like Transmog and Achievements would effectively not exist because they were entirely absent from the data. After weeks of R&amp;D, experimentation, and prototyping, we were confident we could deliver the classic WoW content and gameplay without sacrificing the literally millions of hours put in to back-end development over the past 13 years.
---
&gt;While our initial effort helped us determine the experience we wanted to provide, this second prototype really defined how we’d get there. Starting from a modern architecture—with all its security and stability changes—means the team’s efforts can be focused on pursuing an authentic classic experience. Any differences in behavior between our development builds and the patch 1.12 reference can be systematically cataloged and corrected, while still operating from a foundation that’s stable and secure.   
---
Haha, quality humor right there! I can't wait for Classic now, thanks for hyping me up even more into oblivion!
---
What exactly does this have to do with classic?
---
Maybe. I don't feel like shamans and pallies fill the same role. I mean I know the both heal, but beyond that generality they're very different. Pallies reduce DPS threat generation. Shamans restore mana, increase melee DPS, grounding totem fears. Can two classes that work so differently really be considered drop-in replacements for one another?
---
Well by posting this you just earned yourself a few hundred more competitors.. opps.
---
How would you do the suppression room then?
---
I agree, and no that appeal isnt really working for me. I didnt become the asshole in so many years i definetely wont in wow classic :D
---
So i guess only need to decide on faction now lol
---
17/11/23 would be imp. mana burn and holy nova I gather, but where do the 23 points in the shadow tree go? silence, VE and 5/5 imp mind blast, or...?
---
&gt; I always hated the layout.  It's a fairly horrible layout imo.   I guess they wanted it to be like the Horde's equivalent to Ironforge,   but as far as the concentric layout goes, Ironforge was always much easier to get around in, and to for that matter.
---
Uhm, don't run around in the outside rings..? Cut across the middle of the city itself. Literally a shortcut by doing it that way.
---
lol no if your talents look like this you are a total noob 
---
4/5 in the agi from surv?
---
no scatter?
---
roflmao
---
the real no life hunter is 0/21/30
---
it makes no difference to your argument, but i'd just fuse the two servers and make them one, since they should never get divided again anyway, otherwise you'd separate the community. i don't see why sharding is even necessary here. 
---
I started learning auctioneer in vanilla, just before BC, and by the time WotLK rolled around I was crushing the market on my server.
---
Very slowly? Lol
---
There's a difference between playing casually as an individual, and being in a casual guild.
---
At the bottom of my original comment I recommend that if you want to spend a limited amount of time playing, join a top end guild.
---
&gt; But if it was a new char how did I know the talents were new?
---
When you were leveling in the OLD WORLD with OLD QUEST
---
did the TALENT WINDOW show all 3 trees in one tab? Or had one in each tab, like on WotLK private servers?
---
The fact that you are saying this, when you know it's false, leads me to think that you're simply looking to stir drama.
---
No, it's actually not.
---
Haha I was logging into my retail account when I saw the “tip”. Had instant flashbacks to this dude.
---
Uhm it's still horrible.  And Ironforge did do it better.
---
The top example is boring because you know that the gear is so easily obtainable he might aswell have just afk'd through the entire process of obtaining it, while the bottom example has a story for allmost every piece of that gear.
---
Fishing is a big deal at higher levels in vanilla, imo. Especially for classes without self-heals (most classes, excluding shammy, pally, priest, druid.... any I'm forgetting?). And water areas that raise levels are locked inside areas which require correspondingly higher char levels. So you're not gonna be able to stand around in Org or Ironforge and max-level your fishing.
---
Mages can conjure their own food and water.    
---
Hunters need foods for their pets. So they might need it more, but that depends on pet type, too (bats are fruit and fungus eaters, and that one blood-something bat was highly sought after back in the day).
---
is there a guild like this for holy paladin?
---
And that’s nothing like what I, or the OP, is advocating for. So, you’re original question is either showing ignorance, which can be fixed through explanation and knowledge, or intentionally nefarious with an intent to deceive... which makes you an asshole. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, so hopefully you’re more informed now. But if it the ladder... when then shame on you, I guess.
---
[This one seems to be OK](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest)
---
Add Death Knights
---
especially when gear drops
---
Getting waylaid by an enemy rogue while questing is an integral part of the vanilla experience. So is getting sapped by one in a capital city, /y about it, and watching a bunch of people run around all over the place to find him with hunter flares going this way and that. Sidenote: I spent way to much time in IF and SW sapping dudes myself then slinking away. Watching that little burst of activity is so fun.
---
You also have a high chance of encountering me on the road to Darkshire. &gt;:)
---
I think Warlock is the most replaceable. There's already lots of cloth wearing casters, there's already a pet class too.
---
Silence. 4/5 shadow weaving if you play with a lock.
---
You dont take vamp embrace in that build but as you can see you could go 1/2 imp mana burn and get vamp embrace.
---
2/2 imp mana burn is stronger I feel like, vs paladins especially and other priests.
---
Funniest build I played outside of PI build.
---
The silence is way too op on a healing priest.
---
I’ll be grinding away fishing ;)
---
_Corpse of Surrender01_
---
Classic is not even out yet and I am already optimizing my BC leveling route, talents, professions, etc...
---
&gt; I would flip them. Shaman orc, hunter troll.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Mainly due to racials tho. Looks pretty even when/if in tier gear. Slightly favour orc shaman myself.
---
Orcs have a racial that benefits pet class. Their stun resist can be a godsend for a hunter as well. Don't wanna get locked down in a fist fight at melee range. Their berserk racial is pretty cool, as well.  
---
Trolls have that casting speed racial. Their regen racial is Da Poop and a scam, imo. But they do get Raptor mounts by default. Always a plus. lol
---
Trivia time - the term “shard” used to designate servers in an MMORPG originated in Ultima Online, where each server was lore-wise considered a fragment of the shattered gem of immortality.
---
http://www.uoguide.com/Shards
---
The more you know...
---
Just one question.. WHY? Completely pointless.
---
It hasn't got anything to do with that. You're just insanely cringy and people here are embarrassed on your your behalf for you behavior. You'll see it too as soon as you turn 15 or so
---
Oh and I like the idea of fusing servers too just for simplicity sake, but I have some anecdotal, personal, reasoning for preferring my suggestion. 
---
I played RIFT for several years, I fucking loved that game and would likely pick it over Classic WoW if they did a true resurrection of Classic RIFT instead of the perversion that is RIFT Prime, but it always suffered from being underpopulated. This lead to server mergers that REALLY rubbed some people the wrong way because they liked the Server Identity aspect of the Game. I still remember Shard, RIFT Realms, names and why they were famous. Seastone was full of asshole PvPers, Briafthorn was the home of Voodoo, the best NA Guild, and others. 
---
When RIFT closed these servers down and did forced migrations, they gave players titles like “Of Bloodbreaker” and the like to help with that lost sense of server identity. It’s not a huge deal to me, my time in WoW has seen me play on 10 different servers, but I know some people are very passionate about the idea of belonging to a server.
---
I’ve personally gone from Anvilmar to Anub’Arak, then Lethon, Boulderfist, Garrosh, Sargeras, Zul’jin, Area 52, Stormrage, Exodar, and those are what I can recall lol
---
What I'm advocating is not in anyway related to sharding.
---
I have played WoW off and on for years and never gotten past 50 fishing on any character. Probably because all I catch is scraps of cloth and branches. When does it "click"? Do I just keep fishing at any random body of water? Do I specifically look for schools of fish and wait for those? Any recommended fishing primers?
---
As I said, I don't remember. However looking at the patches, 4.0.1 was released on Oct. 12. Because I had been playing for less then a month when Cata dropped (4.0.3a on Nov. 23.), it must have been in 4.0.1.
---
Who cares? The people who reserved names you brainlet. 
---
Druid is a good choice the only really unique thing they bring is brez which is pretty easy to live with out.  Other than that they don't heal better than anyone, they don't tank or dps well.
---
I kind of agree, on my BE rogue I always end up mogging my swords to something more understated.  Because it looks silly with a female BE carrying two flaming swords that are bigger than my whole body.  With orcs and tauren it looks fine though.  
---
Idk when they added it, I think wrath, but you always fished up garbage if you were in a zone where your fishing skill wasn’t high enough. So if you’ve played recently, that’s why; you need to go to a low level zone.
---
I cannot live without focus target 
---
I'm going to a gnome Warlock because personally I like gnomes and because, while in a fantasy setting with all kinds of playable races, why would I want to pick the least creative one?
---
Want me to demo? I could. Even published on GitHub.
---
And most importantly, bow skill. And orcs have axe skill
---
Everyone stopped caring about what new gear looks like when transmog was introduced, though. Some vanilla sets looked incredible, it's a shame a lot of specs couldn't make use of it and BiS looks like lvl 40 "i grabbed anything i could" armor. 
---
Yea the issue is it requires a ton of time upfront until you reach the point where you can raid log. 
---
Nah. Most of the time you're using crossbows. Namely Ashjre'thul, but most pre-raid are crossbows as well (Blackcrow from LBRS, but also the AV one). The ultimate weapon (Nerubian Slavemaker, from Kel'thuzad) is a crossbow as well.
---
The only actual bow you're using (endgame-wise ofc) is Rhok'delar and arguably Soulstring (which is at best a sidegrade from Ashjre'thul... two raids later).
---
So the +skill in bows means little.   
---
IMO it would be enough to allow the space character anywhere inside a name like GW2 does, that way you can "simulate" surnames and also titles.
---
Most of the time there will be some small chain of quests that tell the story of a zone.  For instance there are a ton of quests in Elwynn Westfall that lead you to the Defias brotherhood and the Deadmines.  Just like there are a ton in The Barrens that lead you to the Kolkar and Wailing Caverns.  Most people skip the longer ones, because they are too much work for reward.  They can be the most rewarding in terms of the story though.
---
There is no large overarching story though and I like that a lot.  I really like just solving the problems that exist in the world rather than a huge big bad guy that threatens the entire existence of everything.
---
Druids bring combat res and a buff, though. Imo rogues are more more replaceable, just bring a fury warrior instead, you're not losing anything. 
---
It's the only class that brings nothing to the raid except its dps. Priests for fort and spirit, warlock for curses, mages for arcane intel and food/drink, druid for mark of the wild and brez, hunters for tranq shot, shaman for totems, paladins for blessings, warriors for main tanking. 
---
nice. didn't plan on rolling a priest in classic, played a lot of shadow in TBC but it seems lackluster without their toys (shadow word: death, vampiric touch and shadowfiend), but this might change my mind, it seems like the ultimate ~~pissing people off~~ support build, especially when coupled with the troll racial spells.
---
healing, dispelling, damaging, healing and damage debuff, mana burning, being general pain in the ass and making life hell for the opposing team... I dig it.
---
That was by and far the biggest failure of WotLK, imo. With the exception of ToC, all of the content was pretty great. It's a shame that if you were late to the pack that you basically missed all but the last two raid tiers, one of which was less a raid and more a boss simulator.
---
So you end up with a worse tank. Replace all rogues with warriors, you keep your best tanks and the dps doesn't change. 
---
Except it has same result - in the end you end up with a bunch of unfamiliar people.
---
Same. Nobody's going to look "perfect".
---
Aren't they making minor graphical changes so that things scale properly on modern monitors?
---
I don't know how they are in retail. In vanilla almost all of them respawn on predictable schedules in known spots and drop random greens. The more exiting rares are those that hunters can tame, e.g. Broken Tooth.
---
What I remember about rares in vanilla was seeing a hunter log in in front of me, a rare spawn in near the hunter, the hunter instantly tags, kills, and loots it, then the hunter returns to the spot where he showed up and logs back out. And that's the real reason *live* rares were truly rare in vanilla although it wasn't uncommon to stumble upon their corpses while wandering the landscape.

well hello there fellas, i'm interested as well!
---
I did as a lock in blue/green with Void sac. Use void to aggro, pull back, rain of fire AOE taunt, hellfire and SAC, usually had 1-2 left to be able to drain soul. I made about 30g/hour doing this
---
There are probably good hpal guides on the internet, just google. I have only looked into resto shamans.
---
Casual can mean the number of hours/week or level of consistent commitment. So you are low hours but on a highly consistent schedule. Some people define casual as "whenever I happen to have time between the wife, kids, and work". 
---
Except it has same result - in the end you end up with a bunch of unfamiliar people. So tell me how it doesn't hurt server identity?
---
&gt; And water areas that raise levels are locked inside areas which require correspondingly higher char levels. So you're not gonna be able to stand around in Org or Ironforge and max-level your fishing.
---
That's not true, you can do 1-300 in Org/IF.
---
The main reason for fishing isn't for food, it's for the buffs that the food gives.
---
But none of that is really related to the STV fishing contest anyway.
---
"How it looks"
---
"What it looks like"
---
Pick one.
---
Oh yeah this is exactly what this is.
---
Very fun, high skill cap.
---
Combine that with iron grenades, mind control cap, rocket helm and reflectors and your very useful in group pvp. You can also 1v1 most classes other than hunters.
---
You forgot about mind controlling people off cliff haha
---
It did when transmogrification was introduced so you couldn't actually tell whether or not what they are wearing is good or garbage
---
What's the reward from this?
---
And I hate this argument. Fantasy worlds are worlds with set "rules",  or however you want to think of it, no different than gravity in ours. That being said I thought the top set looked cool and the mace is one of the best I've seen in WoW.
---
Assuming Classic is the same as vanilla, you should hear splash, and see a little splash animation around the bobber when you need to click.
---
You can fish anywhere, but pools help you get a specific fish. If you're trying to catch those for gold/food buff.
---
For the STV fishing comp specifically, you'll need to fish in the pools.
---
But for levelling to 300 normally, you can do 1-300 in Org/IF between BG queues or while spamming trade/LFG while you spend hours trying to find/fill your group.
---
Edit: r/woosh entire comment section
---
There's also the packs of mounted elites that wander the roads of the barrens, and Arathi.. 
---
Bastards. 
---
But, we need more dots!
---

Innervate. Pretty key to a few fights.
---
\&gt;Hunters need foods for their pets. So they might need it more, but that depends on pet type, too (bats are fruit and fungus eaters, and that one blood-something bat was highly sought after back in the day). 
---
As a hunter you can farm enough gold in an hour to make sure your pet never goes hungry again.
---
...but not more than 16 dots.
---
Best fishing pole in game, or a trinket that makes you into a fish.
---
You can literally wear the Tier 3 Set as a level 1 character now, gear strength is completely disconnected from its look.
---
I did have some fun trying to get the latest full raiding gear before anyone else, though.
---
That was, until they decided raiding gear would now look like random leveling garbage.
---
But soulstone, healthstones, and summoning portal!
---
Don't you need to be level 60 for this quest? It won't be the first thing you do.
---
I can play vanilla wow on my macbook air (2015) but it becomes very hot and loud.
---
You need 225 skill minimum just to catch those and that event didn't come out until ZG so have fun waiting while we're all grinding.
---
Imagine being able to run instances like Maraudon and actually jump down without pulling the entire instance.
---
Congratulations, you named literally the one class that you couldn't go without due to tranq shot. 
---
Lol the Chinese fans are the ones that have the biggest problem with it.  They hate the company developing it.
---
If I recall correctly, the fishing extravaganza was added later in the patch cycle (i think it was patch 1.6 or 1.7). So it's likely won't be in the game at the launch.
---
&gt; That's not true, you can do 1-300 in Org/IF.
---
&gt; The main reason for fishing isn't for food, it's for the buffs that the food gives.
---
&gt; But none of that is really related to the STV fishing contest anyway.
---
True. I had to look it up for the leveling part. You're right. Leveling fishing isn't dependent on area. *Level* of fish is.
---
Cooking goes hand in hand with fishing. I remember getting my cooking quite high, mostly due to cooking what I fished. 
---
The buffs are from cooking as much as fishing (deviate fish, anyone?). But cooking is almost dependent on cooking to level, if they're both what interests you. My opinion.
---
"Party's" is fucking hysterical though. its one word thats wrong like 6 times, i'd give him this one
---
Idk, when the call for more dots goes out, give it all the dots. Ony loved dots.
---
Only enchanted weapons should glow
---
&gt; As a hunter you can farm enough gold in an hour to make sure your pet never goes hungry again
---
Which is funny that you should mention that: did you know Crossroad vendors sell EVERY type of food a pet might need? Even bread. So no matter what type of pet you have at that level, you can find a vendor to help (Windserpents, common in southern barrens and inside Wailing Caverns = fish, bread &amp; cheese)
---
And then he took from a guild before bouncing? Sulf Hammer with no guild tag is never a good sign.
---
I think that if you care about the “lore” element at all then you need to roll on PvP server. You are supposed to be at war with this other faction, and running into them should cause tension. PVE realms just mess with the way the wow should authentically function.
---
I feel confident that PvP realms will be more popular than pve realms. Because PvP realms no longer exist in bfa. PvP realms will now be a classic wow experience only. So for all those players longing for that style of play, they will find their home in classic wow. This also is a reason why I think PvP realms will have greater longevity, than pve realms. Because if you want that style of play, you can’t go back to retail. Another reason pvp will be more popular is because so much of the nostalgia of classic wow is from these open world battles, rivalries, and resource/farming/ world boss control. Retail players have heard of this epic encounters and will want a chance to experience it themselves. Pve realms will still be popular thou, because they appeal to those that want a chill stress free controlled environment (appeals to players who prefer single player type modes). 
---
I think that alliance will heavily outnumber horde. This is simply because the average retail player cares a lot about character appearance. Alliance has all the “pretty” races. This in addition to having an easier time for raid progression due to paladins should make allys dominate most realms. Horde does have better PvP racials, but then you realize that paladins are strong AF in group PvP so in the end, horde vs ally battlegrounds just come down to which side has the better players. 
---
Quick summary:
---
Pvp- players who want the most authentic classic wow experience. 
---
Pve - players who want a chill stress free environment, similar to a single player mode game. 
---
Alliance- players who care about appearance, slightly easier raid progression, and alliance lore. 
---
Horde - players who care slightly more about PvP, who enjoy playing as the underdog/least populated faction, and who like the horde lore. 
---
Some minor details:
---
For the 21 points in destruction to get ruin 2% mana cost reduction wont do you and good. Get two points in improved searing pain, as it is a good finisher on trash (1.5 cast and no travel time)
---
Tailoring is optimal for pre bis, because of robe of the void and the 2% crit on bloodvine. If you are about minmaxing you cant afford to have a gathering profession.
---
Your list contains tons of stuff you can only buy on an established server. Just keep that in mind.
---
The last time I did the epic mount quest you needed way more mats (30 instead of 3 blsck dragonscales etc. We dont know how this will look in classic so keep it in mind).
---
Your pre-bis severely lacks hit rating. Drop some spell damage for hit.
---
On a pvp server always get rank one banish in case you meet another warlock, as you cant use sacrifice if your demon is banished. 
---
Fear rank 1 is not optional, its your best defensive spell letting you kill up to three mobs at once(although you are oom afterwards).
---
For VW you can skip the suffering spell as 90% of the time it is starved for mana not hp.
---
Also regarding VW: always untoggle suffering once the mob is around 20%. You might pull agro but the mob will die within seconds anyway and you should not be standing next to it. This will save some mana on the pet.
---
All in all very solid but you might want to consider checking out Alive's youtube channel (arguably one of the best warlocks in the world).
---
Druid labor union was notified about this post.
---
Don’t forget to tell us your character name on Classic launch!
---
sound fun :) how is mana burn in classic? I remember in TBC it wasn't exactly the shiniest thing ever (you could barely make a dent in most people's mana pools), but it seems to me that with 4-5k(?) mana, max rank could run them oom quite fast, especially when combined with berserking.
---
Don't get me wrong, my heart leaps with joy when we pull a lock in to summon our healer who *still hasn't left Desolace left despite us taking 20 mins to find a tank and everyone else is outside of Scarlet Monastery*, but shamans can provide wipe protection, healthstones are basically an extra potion (a stone? Do you eat it?), and if we really needed to kill things with fire and shadow magic there's others who can do it.
---
&gt; As I understand it, shard is a separate virtual instance of a server (not an existing server) that can be booted up or shut down depending on the load. 
---
This is or original answer, which I’ve already stated is wrong. It’s a switch that is flipped a single time, merging two smaller unsustainable populations into one larger, healthy, one. 
---
&gt; Except it has same result - in the end you end up with a bunch of unfamiliar people. So tell me how it doesn't hurt server identity and its unique community?
---
I was typing a long response, but at this point I feel you’re being willfully ignorant and shifting goalposts to suit whichever conclusion you prefer.
---
No. This isn’t sharding. Yes, server mergers are better for the community than a server dying.
---
Or just a private server.
---
None are essential
---
It's hard for me to discount a class than can fill each major role pretty comfortably when there's things like classes with 3 dps "specs". Also battle rez can be a huge game changer.
---
This is just a junk/fluff title. It relates to classic wow but the video is in new Desolace so probably exists more in /r/wow 
---
BFD will take forever and every caster in your group will want that so dont plan on getting it (unless you get leashed by a 60)
---
People like to use words wrong and are to stubborn to learn to use them correctly.
---
So, he ran enough MC and won enough random rolls on the Ingots to assemble this all by himself? Unlikely. 30% drop rate, so thats aprox 30 runs and never losing a roll. Not to mention the cores and blood of the mountain. I suppose its possible, but back in the day, if you saw this, it meant bad things.
---
This might be a bit off topic, but when were the Loading Screen Tip added to the game?  
---
Did a quick google, but couldn't find any information... Can't remember them being there in Classic, however I can't say that I remember them not being there either... 
---
I take it you shouldn't bring hunters to dungeons then?
---
The reason you think this is way is because you are thinking like a player. Let's pretend I'm Blizzard and am using OP's solution. What are the major drawbacks?
---
1. Server "dying" and needing to be merged looks bad. Not just for investors/public but as private servers show, a seemingly sinking ship is as dangerous as an actual sinking one.
---
2. Being a veteran of a server and then being thrown in with a large new set of guild names and player names can make your server feel foreign again.
---
3. Imagine if you worked hard to get \#1 guild on the server and then lost the position, not because another guild passed yours but because your server is now linked with another. I'd be pissed as hell losing the top slot not because a guild on the server beat mine but because some tourists left.
---
4. Sometimes players like to be the underdog faction. Sometimes players like PvE with their PvP and like to be on the more populated side of a PvP realm. Either way, you've potentially taken that choice away from them by merging with a different A:H ratio.
---
These don't even cover the logistical problems. Which are probably not too difficult to deal with, but are still a bit of work for something they don't have to do anyway.
---
Blizzard has had plenty of chances in the past to do merges and they have never shown any inkling of wanting to do it. They'd rather you fork over cash for a transfer.
---
They can't, druids can fill the healing role.  While you can theoretically use a druid for tanking or dps they don't do it well enough to justify ever taking them over another class given the option.
---
And brez is on such a long cool down that while it provides the occasional nifty save it's hardly reliable.
---
Every major city has every type of pet food available to buy.
---
Private sever as in running a server for himself and have GM rights and 5 minutes later, full set.
---
Bow skills will only really matter during your rhok delar faze. BIS for pre raiding is the AV xbow, and the other ranged weapons you'll have a chance at are the bwl and naxx xbows. Odds are the other MC/BWL/ZG/AQ ranged weapons will be given to melee for stats while advising hunters fo wait for the much better crossbows.
---
Druid, jack of all trades but master of none. If tranq shot wasnt a thing it would have been hunters though
---
Read it again. Notice the “permanent” part? Now notice the lack of “people piping into low pop zones for a little to artificially make it seem alive” bit? Reading comprehension my dude, or you just trying to farm upvotes from the fanatical crowd..?
---
Hi, author of that doc here. The reason you're seeing that is because spellcrit for heals is calculating the crit bonus before adding spellpower (so it's only giving you a crit bonus for the base healing value which after realizing seems wrong). I did look heavily into heal formulas when creating that doc but I was focused on how the spellpower and talents worked, not so much crit. Are you sure there isn't some funny rule with healing where crit is calculated before + healing is added? In my searches just now I couldn't actually find any record of how crithealing is calculated in Vanilla.
---
The loading screen tips were definitely a thing in retail vanilla.
---
It's exactly what happened with the Star Wars prequels with regards to lightsabers. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blkx6axytKQ
---
There are only 3 mobs in the game like this, the crimson guy in EPL, stiches, and rexar
---
Paladins and Shamans do fill vital roles, however.  For example:
---
* Both provide MP5 to the raid (BoW, Mana Spring Totem)
---
* Shamans have "fear ward" in lieu of not having Dwarf Priests
---
* Both provide threat-reducing mechanics for their group or for the DPS in the raid
---
* Both provide powerful buffs in the form of Windfury and Blessings
---
If you got rid of a Paladin and gave the Alliance Shamans it would mostly be okay.  Honestly think it would be harder the other way (without Tremor Totem or Fear Ward).
---
Picking a new class. Doing old stuff with new friends! Back then my family shared one account
---
That’s factually wrong on ND at least - there’s always groups forming for DMT for the buffs, prebis mage staff, prebis rogue/hunter ring (and the 2h off King for hunters), and the major mana potions for healers. Could be wrong regarding other servers however.
---
DMW and DME are typically harder to find groups for (you’re pretty much right about DMW)
---
I found a 15 rare elite on my 13 shaman yesterday. Lost my Onyxia buff and had to ghost run for a couple of min ;(
---
Provided you know wtf you're doing as a feral you can easily DPS as it. The difference is you need to drop more hours into grinding etc than a regular DPS would need.
---
I should have said at 60. Rather than attunements! 
---
Well, I still haven't decided 100% but I think I am going with a new class.
---
I started Vanilla with a Rogue, but I am not huge into PvP. The only reason I stuck with my rogue was because by the time that I leveled to 60, BC had come out and then I just went ahead and leveled to 70. In doing so, I never really had the chance to raid on my rogue in Vanilla so I didn't realize they're not a big factor in raiding compared to some other classes (not that they didn't play their own role)
---
So that is why I think I am going to try a new class out. 
---
Oh, well thats just shitty.
---
I am still considering... I want to play a different class but ... I don’t know if I really want. 
---
Except a full t2 pally
---
They both fill a lot of the same niches.
---
Mana Regen: Pallies for Blessing of Wisdom and Shamans for Mana Tide, both needed by healers for sustain. 
---
Melee Damage Boost: Blessing of Kings for +Strength/+Agi, Blessing of Might for raw +AP from Pallies. Windfury totem for extra swings from Shaman.
---
CC/Debuff counters: Cleanse/Blessing of Freedom for Pallies. Tremor &amp; Grounding Totems for Shaman.
---
Resurrection: Both have out of combat + Shammies can self-rez
---
Resistance: Any resistance aura a pally has, a shaman has too in the form of a totem.
---
There's some strengths and weaknesses to each (generally I feel Paladins' solutions are better), but they generally overlap in terms of what they provide to other classes.
---
I’ll take the L. I was at work half ass paying attention and yeah I fucked that one up.
---
Why put so much effort when we don't know for sure whether Blizzard won't polish itemization, talents, etc.
---
Mained the same Warlock from launch till the end of Legion, and I'm remaking him again for Classic. I always loved the class lore of Warlocks and the greatly differing play styles between builds back in vanilla.  
---
Also don't want all the gameplay &amp; gearing knowledge to go to waste.
---
Is it actually a side grade? I haven't crunched the numbers, but I had figured having so much more dps might offset losing more of your autoshots during raid rotation, since damage will be normalized. Never got to naxx, so I hadn't ever thought about getting Soulstring.
---
Sure I have more nostalgia linked to my Vanilla class. However, I experienced and achieved everything I wanted with that class back then. Will definitely play something new for Classic.
---
I’ll take “what it looks like” for 500 Alex. 
---
Might have disabled the display of guild tags.
---
The patrol in arathi and the patrol in barrens.
---
Same boat. Been messing around more with other classes on pservers, and it's been fun, but it's hard for any of them to grab me as hard as my vanilla lock did.
---
If the only change you're doing is dropping a class?  Look at what abilities are absolutely essential for various fights.  Then address that from there.
---
Because Humans have the best dance :D
---
Invite is expired. :(
---
Idk what timezone Asmongold is in, but if he is in the same one as me, I will chose a different server even if it means there is a server time difference of +2/-2 hours.
---
Don't get me wrong, he is entertaining and all, but personally I find him to be a bad person in general, also he is the type of player who puts his own fun above others even if it means he is making the 'others' not enjoy the game. Actually, he would be having even more fun if he knew they were having no fun.
---
The youtube twitch rips are fun though.
---
Yeah, and ofc all the content that came before. I missed the magic of vanilla and TBC. I've experienced it on private servers but it's just not the same.    
---
So when people say that those who want Classic are just nostalgic, definitely isn't accurate if wrath babies like me want it.
---
oh no reddit doesnt like me what ever shall i do
---
If there is no sharding in faction city's it would be pretty easy to figure it out.
---
&gt; Every major city has every type of pet food available to buy.
---
Yeah, but you're generally not questing there. Not every town/quest hub has a large variety of food from vendors like that. I *think* Sepulcher had mushrooms/fungus. Granted, there were no Undead hunters at the time. But if you ran over there to level with a buddy, you would be SOL as a hunter with a meat-eater pet.
---
I don't see how it would, just thinking of other games where stupid companies punish for that shit. 
---
Yeah it's not a 100% perfect idea, but it solves a lot of problem whose other solutions are so much worse. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
---
Thanks for taking the time to make this spreadsheet, if the rest of the math is sound then it will be pretty useful.
---
I'm not aware of any healing specific exception to how crits work. I doubt there is one.
---
I remember them being in vanilla.
---
One of them was something like "Remember that you can eat and drink at the same time" 
---
When my friend saw that one he was amazed. He made to around level 30-40 without knowing this as a hunter.
---
Good luck with that...
---
I've never seen a compelling argument for why merging servers is somehow better than sharding one server until overpopulation problems subside.
---
&gt;or they are based purely on conjecture (hurts economy, hurts unique server identity).
---
These are not conjecture. These are facts that anyone who has ever gone through a server merge in any game knows to be true.
---
And the gorilla in STV. 
---
Warcraft has always been silly in that regard though. You see the hammers paladins wielded in Warcraft 3? About ten times the size of an actual warhammer. 
---
7 FPS, upper left corner.
---
And them being difficult! Elite status actually means something!
---
I'd rather have mergers happen later, and they can deal with names then.
---
What if there isn't a good option for merging based on the clusters they have and they need to merge different clusters together?
---
MOP would've been much better if they didn't pander to China and Chinese culture. No one asked for that, including the Chinese, as WoW was already very popular in China before MOP. It was just a shitty business decision, and everyone knew exactly what Blizzard was doing.
---
Straight progress. Same toons the whole time and you have to progress. 
---
I mained Shadow Priest back in vanilla, and all the other expansions i have played.
---
Really looking forward to playing it once again. For me WoW is my priest, played lots of alts and enjoyed em, but never felt as connected to them as to the Shadow Priest.
---
So, when classic arrives he will be summoned from the death one more time :)
---
....the picture in the comment i was replying to, not the OP.
---
That's also a very real problem, maybe you make the groups big enough and then rather than merge all together merge from within as it makes sense? 
---
A big problem with just waiting though as somebody pointed out in this thread is not names, it's factions. What happens when you merge servers where I have a horde character on one and an alliance character on another?
---
My only experience in Vanilla was a little before TBC launch and i played a Rogue, then switched to a hunter so i could level quickly, then pvped all through TBC. Switched to Shaman in Wrath and did a small amount of raiding and a lot of dungeons.
---
I am going with shaman because i love the class fantasy and the play style of Ehancement. After I level my Shaman I will probably play a warrior to tank.
---
Do I have to empty my urine bottles too?
---
Is that what I said? 
---
I think not. 
---
Yes, it works well on targets with 100% mana so early in the fight you want to use it. Then they will want to do the same to you, theyll let their team die, try to last minute flash heal and there you silence them/dispel( fear ward) fear , grenade etc xd
---
That's the spirit!
---
I will update it later this week and wait for someone else to tell that it's wrong again :p
---
You can play wow on most hardware, so unless the iMac is ancient it will do just fine, at least for leveling :)
---
Hunter is the best choice. You can also solo DM north.
---
Good points. I still prefer merging from a player perspective, but I think your two points on the Blizzard's perspective are pretty spot on.
---
Addressing the player-side points though, even as a veteran player or a top guild, I would rather be playing on at least a decently (medium pop +) server. Not much pride in being the best on a dead server. I think some people probably would miss having that top spot, but it also introduces more opportunities to play and regain it. Even if there are negatives, it is a net positive for the players.
---
As for point 4, paid server transfers would probably fix this.
---
I mean, if you want people to comment and discuss it, that's literally what Reddit is for.
---
No T shirt?
---
Disgusting
---
1. Don't know
---
2. Hunter because of Feign Death so you can bypass all packs - with Warlock there's 1 pack that you have to clear sometimes.
---
3. Doesn't matter, max out Natural Armor - and take Fire resist 1(for Tinkerer) and Nature resist  3(Princess) and you're good to go. I've used owl and wolf without any problems.
---
4. Herbalism/Mining for the Ghost Mushroom and Truesilver/Mithril veins.
---
With a hunter you can do all the bosses if you wan't, Noxxion is a little difficult and can require some luck. Landslide could be stunned on the servers I've played, so he didn't spawn the extras and was trivial with the correct timing.
---
&gt;leatherwork 
---
&gt;skinning
---
&gt;engineering
---
Pick two.
---
And hunters have pets to offtank in a stress a situation during 5 mans, the best kiting potential, tranq shot, etc etc etc.
---
The point is; all classes are unique and each brings something to the table the others can't.
---
Personally I will roll a hunter because the class is the most fun for me.
---
1. People want to see everyone who is in the city/zone they are in. The feeling of a single, cohesive world is important to most people asking for Classic.
---
2. I can't think how it would severely damage the economy. Like a handful of players farmed up some materials that are suddenly valuable on the merged server? Good for them, they get some money. Maybe one guild has a bunch of raid materials that no one on the second server has, and they can make a killing from selling them to lower guilds. Again, good for them, they get some money and the lower guilds get some help. Just seems like more positive player-generated content.
---
And presumably two dead servers would prefer a populated server over what remnants of an "identity" they are holding onto from when they had a healthy population.
---
Well it's developed in tandem with them, Blizzard is still doing a decent bit of the work. As for NetEase, the Chinese equivalent hardcore fans like us, maybe, but the general Chinese gaming public will go nuts for it. That same company has a number of incredibly successful games over there (54 billion CN¥ in revenue in 2017 for reference). It's like mobile gamers in the US, they DGAF about who's developing it and generally don't have an interest in "traditional" games like we do, they'll play it if it's fun and popular. While there's always a chance it might underperform, I would be quite surprised, even though I personally will probably not play it (though purely in the context of a *mobile* game I think it actually looks quite good). 
---
For most fantasy that is true, but warcraft has never even tried to be consistent in its rules. Dwarven riflemen with guns with a fire rate only achieved in the 20th century coexist coexist with lightly armored orcs that burn down buildings by hitting them with ridiculously huge swords. 
---
Once you go warrior, you can go never go back. Always warrior.
---
I remember the first time I happened upon Rexxar. No one around and I was just in awe... like I unlocked some secret part of the world few else had seen. Pure shot of vanilla nostalgia right in the feels. Classic can't recreate that.
---
Where is Mankrik's wife?
---
Feel free to show this to anyone at all and they'll agree. I know you think you've got an impenetrable defense since you've said you're not a redditor (you are), but it doesn't work like that. You're cringy and embarrassing and the only person who thinks you're cool is you. I'm not sure why you think you're going to get admired by being a super cool badass in a game that was popular before you were even born. It doesn't work. 
---
&gt; But everyone likes to cry that they don't get to do all this AND also do as much dmg as a warrior...
---
Completely missing the point. 
---
I'm actually mainly talking about raids but alright. 
---
Not sure why everyone is so hostile. Thought vanilla players would be a little more mature.
---
Anyway, watch any video about class recommendations on YouTube. I played Hunter back in the day but for people that missed out on vanilla they'll tell you what you need to know. 
---
The point is its meaningless
---
When everyone can get it who cares
---
I dig the sentiment but proportional to total 1-60 leveling time, 1-10 is almost the same for each class. So uh
---
Because you dont understand the point
---
When every set is legendary and everyone can get it no one cares any anymore. 
---
Stormrage set is my favorite for sure
---
I mained a mage for five years from the beginning, and I plan to again.  
---
However, I also had a lot of fun playing alts. Ended up with decent geared on the alts too.  
---
60 hunter
---
60 rogue
---
60 priest
---
60 warrior
---
60 druid
---
and was working on a warlock when TBC came.
---
Only classes I never really got to play a lot where shaman and paladin.  
---
Once reaching 60, I can highly recommend alts. I had a blast experiencing other classes.  
---
Its a quest reward
---
So essentially it's a single server with permanent sharding until the shards get too small.
---
Initial impressions and all that.
---
paladin is pretty solid 1-10
---
I'll note that you can't efficiently farm Mara with a lock *in raid spec,* it must be in SM/DS farm spec. Generally that means it's a dedicated farming character. It's probably better to choose the most versatile gold farming class for your dedicated farming character in case you want to change things up or by some fluke Classic Mara turns out not to be warlock-farmable.
---
I played alliance and will join the horde... 
---
I like that how things were presented on the old site. I like the font. I like how it was presented like a medieval book. I like how it's illustrated. And that off-white colouring. The tasteful thickness of it. 
---
That wasn't hostile, I was just pointing out that each class is unique and has their place. Could you go and reread what I wrote? Because for raiding you have solid DPS and the only class in the game with tranq shot, there is your unique raiding role. What is so immature about that?
---
And just for the record, If I would be in need of a YouTube video I'll let you know.
---
Racing to level 10 takes a couple of hours on any class. There may be like 10-20 minutes difference, at best.  
---
I'd say that starting zones have more to say in this narrow comparison.  
---
Aramoon Here from Red Sector A. Str8 Scrub. Did All the end game raids with you guys. Do you remember when Ralphy the Dwarf Pally Stole the Left or right side of the Binding and then started Disenchanting all the guild loot in Iron Forge... Was it Ralphy or That Warrior...Some Name that began with an "A"...... So long ago my memories are just a glimmer now. I remember you just swimming around in the lava in MC haha. 
---
1. if you make paladins into warriors then you don't need warriors. that is profound
---
Blizzard has always supported Mac for WoW and I see no reason for them to stop with Classic.
---
IDK if you're walking about only raiding or something, but there's all kinds of content to play. I've never even played a druid but have been in dozens and dozens of dungeons with bear tanks. I'll have to let them know that despite having tanking talents and a whole form dedicated solely to tanking, that they aren't able to fill the role. I've also had druid DPS accompany me in dungeons and out in the world for questing and mutual protection. Not to mention BGs. Your claim that druids are healers and healers only holds zero water. Again, not a druid fanboy and have zero interest in playing the class, but their flexibility is unmatched.
---
Damn brah, what was your time played before TBC hit? lol
---
Literally the only good talent in fury for early leveling is 5% crit. Everything else is almost meaningless, since enrage wont trigger from /sit. Even if it did, arms would be better.
---
Meanwhile, every single arms talents early is good for leveling. Parry is amazing, increased rend damage is actually good early on. Imp. Overpower is super strong and deep wounds is also decent.
---
You don't have to put points in Tactical Mastery up until you need it.
---
It took some practice to learn. You can't follow another player because lag would kill you. There's a pattern on the floor you can stand on: X, X, Line, O (ex, ex, line, circle). Once you get it, you get it and the only deaths you'll have are from the fucking eyestalks in the teleport room.
---
And not the tier2 bracers, those would cover up the upper forearms with the correct tier2 skin
---
Which is basically what any given server merging plan is. The difference is the OP suggests setting up certain guidelines to facilitate the process.
---
Mained a Warlock, and hit 60 right before TBC launch. I've been leveling a rogue this go round on lightshope, keep bouncing back and forth on the decision but will likely go with Warlock for nostalgia. 
---
At the end of this vanilla, we will start a new timeline. One where Thrall doesn't become a lame ass quitter, and one where Arthas and Illidan somehow become best buds and create the Black Icecrown Citadel Temple. And we have to join the Burning Legion or something... And there will be ptw microtransactions and sub numbers will skyrocket.
---
You guys have smart phones right?
---
I'm not against merging low pop and dying server. I'm against creating a system that implies and will definitely cause server dying ( I mean stretching player-base across dozens of servers). What we need is a handful of servers with same names as the most popular servers during vanilla but without hard population cap for some time to accommodate initial influx of people.  
---
I thought it would be helpful for inline commenting and suggestions. 
---
Just don't expect to raid as Enhance. It's one of the worst dps specs. 
---
To be fair tho in the starting zones its less an issue of if the servers can stay up, than the issue of can people even play with so many people competing for such a small set of mobs (and if that would be fun for anyone). That is where i think its a extremely different problem between AQ event and initial server launch and I seriously doubt that they would be handled in the same way.
---
Play which one you think will be more fun. If your circumstances change or the economy is fucked it won’t matter that you’re good at farming.
---
as much as everyone keeps telling me this, and the fact that I wont mind healing. I can guarantee I will get into raids eventually. That's just the way the game is. I'll find a nice group of people that let me tag along. But like I said I wont mind switching to heals for raids.
---
;_;
---
Priests can farm DM:E lashers with holy nova, which they can get by shifting one point away from optimal raid spec (e.g. sacrificing 2% total mana). They just need enough int to cast enough novas to kill the lashers; it's braindead easy. That's just one option they have. My point is, don't assume that priests can't farm gold.
---
Any caster is completely fine with a LMW. Warlock would be fastest though I bet with imp helping.  
---
On a new server hunter/rogue/warrior aren’t that painful because in populated zones you constantly get heals/buffs/groups from others. It’s when you’re completely solo and have to skip quests it starts getting painful.
---
I have always wanted to try and really get into playing a warrior. I've always been a Druid (tanking/healing), and never could pry myself away.
---
Why do you love Warriors so much? 
---
https://discord.gg/classicwow That should definitely be working. It isn't?
---
Idk baby I'm hyped to do pvp, I was on pve all of orig. Vanilla and I cant wait to get to rank 8, idk if I will shoot for higher.
---
Well, you aren't required to participate.
---
I don't care about the point, I just like how badass the top set looks.
---
Undoer. Definitely Undoer.
---
^.^.^.^.^.^.^u/Undoer
---
Druid 
---
I just haven't played a Vanilla Paladin in about 12 years...
---
Interesting.  How would you rank them?
---
I like tmogs where people do silly things. I liked making my monk look like a farmer! I'm excited for no tmog classic though, too :)
---
I won the tourney on a level 19. Don't think there's a level requirement
---
Yep, there is no prestige in anything anymore. Titles, mounts, gear, etc. 
---
What is a LMW?
---
They're not bad if you group, but any class is better with a group.  Maybe I should have specified "solo".  
---
Except when you want to track them down, then they are gone for an eternity!
---
Hammer of Monster Energy?
---
"Invite invalid.
---
This invite may be expired, or you might not have permission to join."
---
/shrug
---
You'll find them with a small group of 2 fighting them, ask them to invite you, then have them actually invite you after they've already killed the fuckers.
---
Sharding is a server technology implemented so that they don't need to create too many realms at launch that will then dilute the population six months later when all the tourists leave, resulting in incredibly destructive realm-mergers, losing names, guilds, etc.
---
\- Crimson courier
---
\- Demetria
---
\- Stitches
---
\- Forsaken courier (he's non elite but has couple bodyguards, so he's decently hard to kill solo)
---
\- the Barrens night elf outriders in the barrens traveling from south barrens to Wailing Caverns ([https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5797](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5797))
---
\- the horde patrol in Loch Modan 
---
I loved playing enhance shaman in vanilla, stopped playing mid way through BC.  Once I heard vanilla was making a comeback I picked up Legion and wondered what the hell the steaming pile of shit I was looking at they called enhance Shaman.  Really looking forward to having my totems and shocks back.
---
Don’t worry about him.  He is either trolling or doing some grade A projection. 
---
I'm thinking I may go shaman as well. It was the second class I got to 70 in TBC and I enjoyed enhancement a lot. Would be cool to see it in Vanilla. But I still go back and forth on shaman or rogue, as rogue has usually been my main in each expansion since the end of ICC. I'm just not sure I'll want to play it without some of their later expac toolkit.
---
Luckily for me personally I played pserver and I leveld to:
---
1. lvl 45 rogue
---
2. 2 lvl 60 shamans, one preBiS
---
3. lvl 22 rogue
---
4. lvl 40 hunter
---
Doing that and just returning to my tauren warrior every time leveling him back up on various projects. 
---
So I know a different class just does not work for me. 
---
1) Certain druid specs are capable of soloing Mara, at least Princess and Rotgrip. 
---
2) Hunter I guess. It's also the most failsafe one and does not require specific gear or talents which boost your pet like warlock.
---
3) I've seen Tortoises being good at that due to Shell Shield ability.
---
Hate to be the spoilsport but some if not most of the information thats in there is brutally wrong. For example loot tables can be totally wrong as they don't work in mangos as they did in retail, Mangos is also famous for missing most of the gossip texts or just having a generic one.
---
WTF IS DD?!?!?!? IT'S DPS YOU GOD DAMN RETARD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
And you know every single boss fight in classic enougj to lead a raid if needed right?
---
wtf? Oo
---
Constantly expanding vertical progression is the root of all evil. At some point you have lower level raids with badass looking armor that can be soloed in 20 minutes. So your newer, high level raids have to one-up that somehow. And even that has its limits. So now, after 15 years, the game is full of easily obtainable, overdesigned equipment. It's no surprise they seem to have abandoned the concept of tier sets altogether.
---
No 2.5 helm?
---
If you give warriors the other classes skills you dont need anything but warriors. Even better! ALL LOOT IS WARRIOR LOOT!
---
I'm not OP but for me personally it's that the game seems to specifically enable:
---
\- mages
---
\- priests
---
\- warriors
---
Warriors being the melee of the three, I like it the most. 
---
Gear is tailored for you: agi, stam, str, hit, crit and no wasted stats which drives me nuts on shaman. Their T2.5 is great for elemental but I hate the fact, they have str/agi on it which is useless and could be int/stam.
---
Warriors are TANKS in dungeons. I cant give away my leading role in dungeons. I'm a good mediator, I'm good at setting the pace, I'm good at marking and leading in general, so it would be a waste to be tagging along as a rogue if I could be the good tank. 
---
As a good tank you get a lot of praise and make friendships quickly.
---
Last is the class fantasy. Mages need some arcane spell to prohibit casting. A rogue needs a well timed roundhouse kick into the vitals to prevent casting. 
---
A warrior however just swings his ironclad fist into the mouth of his casting foe and he's done casting for a bit.
---
Howling at the enemy, so he shivers in fear. 
---
It's just awesome!
---
The first 10 levels all the classes are pretty much the same so I guess I rank them all equally.
---
Hehe maybe I tale my words back, hunters make great memes
---
Right, so now give me your reason for taking more than 1 Hunter in a 40 man raid?
---
Sure, some classes or specs got nerfed into the ground, or made completely irrelevant for raids, I agree. As someone who remembers putting 1 point into Innervate... no thanks. 1.12 all the way for us druids. 
---
Thanks for the responses all. Seems like I'll be making a hunter for as an alt for farming, whether that's mara or mixing things up elsewhere.
---
what's your problem? Can't we have a discussion and express opinions without being total douche bags? Just stop. There's no need for it. People like you are the reason the current community is so damn toxic. 
---
I thought the plan was to release 1.12? 
---
Back in 2005 I was 7 and started as a hunter, I'm 21 now and my tastes have changed, warrior all the way baby (although it's not a fresh experience for me as I've leveled 4 of them to 60 on various servers)
---
I hope its in the first content phase. 
---
There is no level requirement.  Just need to be able to catch the fish (level 10).
---
19s used to win pretty regularly while fishing for the boots + hat.
---
&gt; People want to see everyone who is in the city/zone they are in. The feeling of a single, cohesive world is important to most people asking for Classic.
---
Yes, and server mergers are essentially like super sharding, where the shards are completely separate until one fateful day they're forcefully merged together. With regular sharding you may be unable to interact with a subset of the playerbase some of the time, but with mergers you're completely incapable of any kind of interaction with anyone on your "partner server" until one day papa Blizzard decides you're ready to become one in front of god.
---
&gt;I can't think how it would severely damage the economy. Like a handful of players farmed up some materials that are suddenly valuable on the merged server? Good for them, they get some money. Maybe one guild has a bunch of raid materials that no one on the second server has, and they can make a killing from selling them to lower guilds. Again, good for them, they get some money and the lower guilds get some help. Just seems like more positive player-generated content.
---
If one server is richer than the other, the players on the poorer server will have less spending power on the AH post-merge.
---
I remember that too. The only viable spec just for innervate. No Boomkin with hurricane as the top talent also sucked.
---
Are you completely sure you enjoy priest and mage play-style equally? I ask because I played a priest in vanilla and have decided on mage for classic.
---
I love playing a priest and I love being a sought after person etc. But I enjoy playing a mage more, and that is a fact I just have to live with. 
---
You've convinced me fear isn't optional, updated!
---
For gear: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJBk-Zq-v8xN-6sfFKA9M4rGQioOKQc-OsnhJRvIwGM/edit#gid=2034885283 is the spreadsheet I used. I agree stage 1 hit is a little low. Stage 2 they have it go up to 8% hit for pre-bis. 
---
Do you have recommendations for alternatives in stage 1 given our current assumptions or specific videos from Alive?
---
Hi, /u/KanedaSyndrome
---
&gt; That mace would weigh more than the person (including the armor). Soon WoW maces will be cars on sticks.
---
Thunderfury
---
Ashkandi
---
Dark Edge of Insanity
---
Sulfuras
---
Corrupted Ashbringer
---
(...)
---
Tons of not practical or silly stuff even in WoW. 
---
Pets at max loyalty rarely get hungry.  If you have a stack of food you shouldn't run out within a few hours.
---
Man, I remember when I first played I would stick to roads out of fear.  
---
After a few weeks, however, I realized it was adding a ton of time to travel, so I just started b-lining.
---
For pve, maybe. Tracking and the longest range in the game are huge in pvp. That and their pet make them the #1 defensive class in AB. The range makes them the deadliest class in AV. Tracking alone makes them very useful in wsg.
---
And in world pvp, they are the most efficient gankers. Rogues have their reputation, but you are more likely to get ganked by a hunter than any other class from my experience.
---
Also, rogues and mages would be more dominant in pvp without hunters to worry about. Horde priests as well, since viper sting is so huge against them. The pvp meta would be a lot different without hunters.
---
Agreed.
---
Nah we are booked solid every weekend for Naxx : )
---
I mained a Mage, which was a ton of fun but I'm now playing with my girlfriend who wants to play Rogue.  She normally plays healers, but wanted to mix it up - so I'm gonna mix it up and play Druid.
---
I'm sure they will be very common.  
---
Going with my old warrior. He was old then, but the weary bones are called upon once more.
---
Oh it's just a symptom of the same underlying disease.
---
I think its a european thing? I know from vanilla/bc at least on my server it was always DPS, I never saw DD until private servers 
---
If you play casually you won't hit 60 for 3 to 4 months so I wouldn't worry about it yet.
---
The two most wealthy players I ever knew were a warrior and a warlock. The first played the ah and the second just did alchemy everyday. Farming can be good money but the real gold is in finding your niche and sticking to it. If I were you I'd go priest if your draw to mage is simply the farming potential. 
---
You didn't answer the question.. Seems kinda stupid to bring on someone from a private server for an AMA but fail to give a reason why when you even say that
---
&gt;This is not a community for private servers or current World of Warcraft.
---
that's what a full rage execute looks like
---
What does that have to do with raiding casually?
---
Stop reposting.. This idea is old and has been brought forward by many people already. 
---
Even as a rogue main since vanilla, I'd say rogue. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8193
---
Coulda sold that account for phat loots
---
Druid absolutely is not #4, they're a top 3 leveler but easily have by far the worst 1-10 of any class; they're hampered by horrible mana problems and low damage. Warrior, mage, rogue and even hunter should all have easier and smoother trips from 1-10.
---
None of them!  One of the most profound realizations of vanilla wow is all the classes play a role in the endgame, and every one of them are difficult to replace.
---
^^^^jk it's druids lol
---
They have stated that 1.12 will serve as the foundation.
---
The content will be staggered and several changes will be made to deviate from 1.12 specifically and all of 1.0-1.12 generally.
---
Some rares are still rares actually. Some weeks ago I wanted to get the Garn Nighthowl mount from WoD. Took me quite a few tries because when I tried to get it the mob who dropped it often just wouldn't be there. 
---
Are you not using fishing lures? Use them and you will start catching fish. Fishing level scales with zone, at 50 fishing in classic you will want to be in the post-starter zones, ie, Barrens, Westfall, etc.
---
Jokes on you, I only use lore friendly names. Hah.
---
He could have just deactivated the guild display option ;)
---
they successfully martyred the server for classic wow. People didn't realise this at the time since the chance of a blizzard vanilla server was pretty much nonexistent in peoples mind. People were also upset that they had lost their character to a cease and desist. Knowing what we know know, people would have been happy with nost being a sacrifice to the greater good.
---
ret pala, history repeat itself but this time I'll heal to raid and pvp to get gm #nolife
---
Probably Druid.  They are the least played class for a reason.
---
Lesser magic wand
---
Min maxing was also a thing in vanilla. Just that only 5% of all players did back in the day. 
---
I've always felt like zmog ruined the game along with flying and resilience.
---
“If you change x to work like y then y won’t be needed” 
---
Who would’ve thought...
---
1. Yes, not ideal. Still better than a dead server, or any other alternative.
---
2. Maybe relevant right when the server merges. But AH prices will increase on average (more money in the economy) and the differences will even out.
---
I wasn't around for the first time around, nor did even really play WoW much at all. I'm really looking forward to just dicking around in an older style MMO. I tried retail a few months ago and, coming from Everquest back in the day, it just felt like an entirely different experience.
---
Play what you enjoy, after the first 6 months the richest people are not the farmers anyway. It's the guys sitting at the auction house and having farmers do the heavy lifting.
---
The answer is, we have always allowed discussion of Nostalrius as it is 1) defunct and 2) a presumed major catalyst to the creation of Classic WoW. Also, Nano literally met with Blizzard in California before Classic was ever announced when Blizzard invited a few Nost team members to meet the Blizzard team.
---
Paladins and shamans would screw up faction balance, so they're safe if you can only remove one.
---
Warriors are the only truly capable tanks, so they're safe on that merit alone.
---
Priests are the premiere healing class, and shadow priests prop up warlock DPS.  Relatively safe
---
Druids versatility is underrated.  They can fill any role while leveling and have good utility for end game, not to mention being totally irreplaceable in PvP.
---
Warlocks bring curses, soulstones, and healthstones, and can summon.  Best DPS class for utility.
---
Mages conjure food and water, have portals, and their absence would leave a vacuum in PvP.  Ability to kite is a plus.
---
Hunters bring sub-par DPS, but I think tranquilizing shot is absolutely necessary for some raid encounters.
---
Rogues bring good DPS, but no utility.  Aside from the people who play rogues, most would not miss them.  The world (of warcraft) would be a better place without them.
---
My first character ever was a warrior. Got to 60 pretty fast (played closed beta) and raided MC with the best guild on the server. One 2 week vacation later (was 16 at the time) and I lost my raid spot. 
---
Rerolled a druid the day I got back and never looked back. Druid all the way. 
---
He is talking about: One guy logs into the server "Laughing Skull" and the other guy logs into the server "Mal'ganis" anmd they both end up in the same Azeroth and can see eachother. Where is this not Cross Realm. This has nothing to do with "farming upvotes" this is just a form of pre-emptive "sharding" to later on dump ppl that haven't been able to see eachother or play with eachother for weeks or maybe even months or even years suddenly into the same merged server using the same Cross Realm zones we see on Retail now.   
---
&gt; Server names aren't changed. Player names aren't changed. Guild names aren't changed. You still log into Laughing Skull and this other guy still logs into Mal'ganis. You both end up in the same Azeroth. 
---
This is the exact same way as they merge realms on retail the last few years, based on Cross Realm techniques. 
---
But you could, right?:-))
---
Makes total sense for Warrior and Warlocks.
---
Even on the Alliance side they have constant aggro Problems. I think my favorite Warlock was the guy always rushing into mobs with hellfire.
---
I love people who just don't give a damn and play just hardcore. lol
---
Mages take 2nd-4th place on all servers.
---
Most popular on RP (2nd place after Priest, 15,25%)
---
Least popular on RP-PvP (tied for 3rd place with Druid, 11,76%)
---
RP-PvP is the best place to roll a Mage imo. However considering how much people stack mages, any server seems fine for them. 
---
Look at the demo and look at their other games.  It is undeniably a reskin.
---
IMO mage is easier than priest, warrior, hunter, pala, druid, but not warlock. That frost snare and frost armour is just so good...
---
Thank you! You make playing a warrior sound like so much fun. And, I am looking to have fun in an MMORPG again. I miss it! 
---
I also quit in Cata, then came back and played through all of Legion, then quit again before BfA. Legion, while fun and interesting, was a completely different game than Pre-Cata was. Quite sad how much the game has changed...
---
I've already roughed it as a rogue once in vanilla. I'd like to play one again, but probably after I level my first character so gold, gear and mats aren't as much of an issue. Maining a shaman this time. I always regretted not playing one back in the day. They were so mysterious with their ghost wolf, weird totems, and rising from the dead.
---
Nano's talked about that multiple times on multiple channels already.. It not that different from some random person on the subreddit answering questions..
---
They share one permanent server once the merge is complete. They are one and the same. That is not an example of Cross Realm Zones. CRZ is when two people from different servers are dumped into the same zone due to that Zones population being low, but player B being removed from that instance server once they cross into another zone. 
---
Would changing the Realm heading to Malganis make this different? No. It’s the same. 
---
If you have to think this much about food for a pet then boyyyyy vanilla must be a bumpy ride for you.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla as well and had a blast doing all those things. I think the meta has changed for every game, really. DPS are there to pump out numbers and nothing else. I don't remember being so fixated on damage meters in vanilla. I think I actually had mine set to hide during combat. Being a well-versed hunter was more important than doing absolute max dps. At least that's how I remember it. Hopefully the community will pick that mantra back up and run with it.
---
Just clarifying for any lurkers, these 4 items are excellent points for current servers (ie retail), and are not meant to be contrary to OP's proposed plan for new classic servers.
---
If this isn't the case please reply &amp; I'll redact this
---
Warrior is OP on so many fronts! One more reason to pick frost mage as my main&lt;3
---
P.S. Pretty sure you’ll run out of those pesky pots eventually
---
Even if you started the raiding at 3.3, you still could enjoy Ulduar via pretty hard 25hc runs and +0 yogg.
---
Step 1: Make a Rogue friend  
---
Step 2: Annihilate everything in WPVP
---
Also Enh shamans with improved Strength and Windfury totems? Put em in a group of warriors and rogues in a raid and the raid's DPS will go up for sure. Enh Shamans are great DPS-Support. Personal DPS doesn't mean anything except for cool screenshots in a raid when some solid buffs to your teammates, damage, and occasionally the random clutch heal are all valid contributions in any raid environment.
---
I don't know if you played retail the last few years, but this whole idea is basicly exactly how they merge realms on retail. And this they describe it
---
&gt; Building on the existing cross-realm technology, a Connected Realm is a set of two or more standard realms that have been permanently and seamlessly "linked." Connected realms behave as if they are one cohesive realm, meaning players are able to join the same guilds, access a single Auction House, run the same Raids and Dungeons, and join other adventurers to complete quests.
---
You're fighting an uphill battle, mushkinss. 
---
You see, the difference between this plan &amp; sharding - one artificially restricts the amount of players on an instance to compensate for launch issues, temporarily, until pops stabilize. And the other is named sharding so we hate it.
---
I don't think I ever managed to get my hands on this Fishing Rod. I also think the Horde gets a very awesome Fishing Rod from a Quest. And I was an idiot and sold it. :(
---
That is the one thing I will always regret. But not this time! I will keep the Quest Rod and I will get this bad boy, too!
---
Great synergy in this pair up. You can sneak together in cat form which is super useful, and being able to tank/heal makes the two of you finding groups a breeze.
---
Things like this make me think classic will be a twink fest. EVeryone knows there plan. 
---
Piercing howl is one of the best actually. 1-60 itll save hours of time corpse running any time your in an area with high density. Also leaving caves etc. 
---
I’m not seeing the problem here. A permanent merger of two dying realms to make them sustainable. How is this not a good thing? I’ll admit I’ve been framing my argument more towards CRZ, which was wrong and my mistake, but connected realms that are permanently joined to avoid death... I don’t see how this is bad. In anyway. 
---
Haven't tested it myself either but haven't seen much hunter positive review on it. 
---
I presume the higher attack speed may have issues with how aimed/multi shots work, since they're straight weapon damage moves. Since you're gating these autos with them...it might become an issue unless you change the rotation clipping some autos in the way.   
---
I only played Rogue, twinked my Druid very late in TBC and fell in love with the class.
---
I think both of the Classes are absolutely fantastic. Orc Rogue would hit me with a lot of feelings, but I love healing now. I think Druid is the right choice here.
---
But I'm going to miss my good old friend, for sure. But I'm so addicted to Healing. Can't heal with a Rogue. :(
---
I don't think I have time to play both.
---
THANK YOU
---
Some of this is also the removal of spell batching in current wow as well. Spells cast on others are now dealt with instantly rather than batched together.
---
While you need at least two hunters' tranquilizing shots in order to pass a boss in MC, and also don't forget Trueshot Aura as a great boon for other physical damage dealers, there is more to it than that. We need 40 people, most of which do DPS. I do not plan to push for world firsts, so hyper efficient raids are not my priority. 40 warm bodies is on the top of the priority list for me in a raid however, and if they know their encounters that's even better. So there are plenty spots for hunters in a raid.
---
Can I ask why I get a feeling of hostility from your side? You might not notice, but it's not really stimulating to discuss this topic with you, do you understand that?
---
That's what I meant in the first paragraph. The three master classes so to speak are priest, mage and warrior in their healing, ranged and melee role. 
---
And me being a melee player, warrior is the obvious pick. 
---
Also I dont want to be OP, that's why I play classic. I WANT my weaknesses, so I can make friends. Having a priest and elemental shaman as friends is the ultimate wreckage in small group wPvP. Big burst, dispells and the glorious WF.
---
Mages will never feel the glory of Sweeping strikes + cleave + whirlwind and all mobs/players dying at once. 
---
Who is going to dispel your poison then?
---
Reminds me of that near-endgame BiS rogue claiming the world's first DM-T solo, whilst being fully DM-T buffed.
---
Yeah, my biggest concern is getting into raids later on and then the whole gear trickle down, but whatever - classic gonna classic.
---
Part of me would love to see them rework the graphics of the ZG and AQ sets. It seems pretty clear since they were all just recolors of 4 basic skins for cloth/leather/mail/plate that they were placeholder work like T1 and T2 were at launch.
---
20 secs cooldown on tranq shot. This is the one. Needing multiple tranqs in certain fights.  
---
I don't think the one's in retail will work, as Classic will be on a different client based on the Legion expansion. You can bet addons will be developed. I bet if we have a beta stage, there will be addons ready for launch.
---
Get a tanky friend (nor warriors or bears exceed at farming, so they will be interested) and get loadsamoney by 2manning DM E as a priest.
---
Elvui has already been backported to 1.12. I'm raiding Naxx with it on a server now. Modern addons are already backported, and with 1.13 being based on the 7.3.5 client, more modern mods will have an easier time being used in classic than they're able to be used in 1.12 currently. Everything you saw in Legion is going to exist in retail Classic, if it has a useful function. 
---
Connected realms don't have to be bad, however especially in Classic (Vanilla) where community is very important it would feel weird to have retail like merges halfway down the path as they can be very disruptive of the communities that are formed. On retail connected realms are pretty much fine, i just don't see the appeal in Classic. However it will be a hard problem to solve, which ever way they choose. 
---
There's a shit ton of really good music in that genre that's been released in the last 2 years or so. It's making a comeback in the underground scene. I want to see new PvP vids with new music of the same genre. 
---
There's a lot of new edgy rock that can be used too.
---
Don't worry you're safe; you're a gem
---
I'm a big fan of warrior T3 as well :P
---
1.13 is based on 7.3.5, so if anything, we'll have access to more moden addons than we have for 1.12. The backporting is great and all, but with classic we can just tweek 7.3.5 versions of existing addons. 
---
You know you can just buy the ingots right
---
It shares similar gameplay elements, but from a technical perspective they confirmed that it doesn't share a codebase (i.e. a reskin) on the record, which is A.) not something worth lying about in the first place, and B.) would get you into some serious legal hot water if it turned out to be untrue, and would especially rile up investors. Again, if the gameplay elements are good for a mobile game, it ultimately does not matter if they're similar to a previous game they've made before, seeing as the game as a whole it is still sufficiently different in other areas. It is also under the purview of Blizzard meaning it will be a lot more polished than some Chinese game ported to the west by a Chinese developer, and has a dedicated team working on it at Blizzard as well. Still probably won't touch it, but keeping an objective view here is important. 
---
I played Horde in Vanilla, but I'm thinking about changing to Alliance when classic comes out.  I probably won't do it though.  I love the Horde.
---
I'm in between a priest, druid, mage, or huntard for Classic.  Priest seems fun and I'll always get a group, but they don't have any movement abilities.  I did Shaman on Nost so I don't want to roll that.  Druid and hunter have movement abilities for lower levels and that's cool but both are not that good in raids/late game.  Druids are the worst healers and hunter DPS is bad compared to mages.  Mages are really cool, but I always get bored of them down the line.
---
&gt; Zep to UC -&gt; UC flight path -&gt; Sepulcher
---
Can you fly right from UC to Sepulcher or do you have to walk?  Where do you die to take advantage of GY?
---
If you guys are coming from a pserver, there is a chance your pet will not be putting out the same DPS you are used to, or so I'm told. Apparently some of the vanilla servers have the pets gaining twice as much focus as they are supposed to. I'm no expert on the  matter, but just a heads up.
---
The point is that you all think the game should be balanced around how many roles you can fill in a raid environment but that's simply not how vanilla is. 
---
Being able to fill two roles in a raid is one of the great perks of a warrior in vanilla but it doesn't help you not get shit on in any situation when you're by yourself. 
---
Raiding is just one part of the game. I don't know if anyone else recalls but the forums used to be flooded with posts of people crying about pvp balance. Boost paladin damage without nerfing the fuck out of their heals/utlity and they would be pvp gods. 
---
But at the end of the day it doesn't matter what was fair and what wasn't because classic is all about recreating the game exactly as it was. 
---
Classes being that inbalanced in end game PvE was never intended. 
---
And raiding is one part, that's right, but it's quite obviously the most important part of the game.
---
I really wish they had not abandoned the unique weapons / unique proc weapons concept.  EQ had a lot of items that were very good and had long staying power due to unique procs.  Blizzard argued that it killed build/equipment diversity as it made people have items be "required" but I think it had the opposite effect of creating the sameness effect.  If you had unique equipment drop off different raids, maybe there wouldn't be the one-up gear design as bad as it got? 
---
Kinda looks like something you should be able to make with engineering.
---
Thank you ! 
---
1) In theory (well) geared Fury warriors and feral druids. 
---
2) Hunter
---
3) Any high HP pet, like bears, or high armor pets
---
I used to do mining and it was secondary to selling the blue crap.
---
What you haven thought about yet, is that you can sell "runs" to lvl 60 warriors and to low level rogues/feral druids. You can charge up to 25 gold for the item actually dropping. 
---
Were speaking in relative terms, I don't know what 'very common' is to you I just said they will be significantly less common in classic. 
---
On pservers there are multiple mc/zg and aq20 pugs every single lock out. You can log in on a weekend and be guaranteed to get these raids done basically. There won't be this many dedicated players per server on classic. There were 20 some guilds to clear BWL the first week of release and then like 20 more the next week or two. You'll have like 5 guilds doing this per server come classic. 
---
This is the video i am talking about
---
https://youtu.be/T3LwYP8TIiE
---
He also gives pre bis item suggestions for all stages of the game according to what blizz revealed at blizzcon. There is also a written version and all links are included. Have fun checking it out
---
Retail actually, just relived classic in my own way while grinding these out in retail. Got all the mats to make sulfuras myself :) 
---
It's cause you are saying a class that the other guy likes is nearly useless.  If we are min maxing then yes, not many people will miss an extra hunter.  But, he is going to roll it regardless and have fun still.
---
Shit my bad, but the dungeon is long regardless. Couple of days ago someone posted an xp per hour chart from 20 to 30 and running bfd was the biggest hit in the xp/h
---
Troll is best for bow right?  
---
These 10k p servers are full of Different languages such as Chinese, Russian, English the big 3. Also lots of bots due to bad cheat detection. They won’t play together so it really limits the population.
---
I would put it closer to 5k if you are English. So it’s not too far off a high pop server. (This is for raids. In dungeons it doesn’t really matter if people don’t talk)
---
Did they announce server caps yet?  With 3k-5k people on at all times there are going to be a lot of pugs.  
---
Hunters or Druids. They were the last 2 Classes added and you see that. Hunter is mediocre at everything except leveling and Druid has nothing great except Innervate.
---
And yet you create this ranking...
---
I can only speak about how it worked back in Vanilla. I don't know if it's changed since 2006. But based on my 300 Fishing skill experience from back then...
---
&gt;When does it "click"?
---
You cast the fishing float into the water and you get a 30 sec (?) channelling / countdown bar. At some point during the duration the fishing float will bob and you will hear a splash sound. That is when you should rightclick on the float.
---
&gt;Do I specifically look for schools of fish and wait for those?
---
Most bodies of water will have randomly spawned fishing pools, which are resource nodes, in much the same way as mining nodes or herbs spawn. The fish pools look like swirly circles within the body of water. I'm struggling to find a good picture but hopefully [this one gives you some idea what they look like](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/e/ea/Abundant_Firefin_Snapper_School.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100311121532). When you mouse over them, they will be named e.g. "Firefin Snapper School", which gives you some idea what you can expect to catch (but it's not guaranteed to be only that fish, you can catch still other things too). The way you harvest the nodes is by casting your fishing float somewhere into the circle, then waiting for the fish to 'bite' as described above.
---
&gt;Do I just keep fishing at any random body of water?
---
You can, but you catch fish more reliably out of the fishing circles. If you just randomly fish anywhere, you are more likely to get junk.
---
IIRC You will need to fish in zones that roughly match the level of your fishing skill, where the zone level is roughly equal to your fishing skill, divided by 5. If you have fishing skill &lt;50, you will need to stick to fishing in the starter zones. If you want to fish successfully for Mudskunks in Zul'Gurub (the main reason I got my skill up to 300) then you will need 295+ fishing.
---
Again it doesn't matter what was intended or what wasn't. The point is to make vanilla as it was not as it was intended. 
---
If people think certain classes are really that overpowered they are free to play them. I have a decked out warrior and as fun as it is to top charts and tank raids in a pinch I'll never play one again due to their complete lack of utility and quality of life features. 
---
I’m going to play a Shaman as I have only played one at low levels.
---
Gonna take months for BWL to be puggable unless there is a solid core in the pug which are always together. Maybe if they’re alliance they can pug it I suppose 
---
I say we just say fuck it and dump everyone into the server.  No sharding, no dynamic respawns, and none of this server merge crap.  Only the quickest can tag mobs.  We'll be in Durotar forever bois.
---
Good stuff indeed. Yup that’s definitely OP in an “involountary” way haha. All we mages can do is to control and aoe like mad (eventually players too). It feels great.
---
I reaaaaaaly want to play a rogue again like I did in vanilla. Great dps, great at pvp. But they have a hard time finding groups if you aren't in a guild and I know for a fact that they're going to be even more popular than back then. I'm considering warrior as an alternative simply because all specs are viable and they're the only truly good tank. Also maybe mage for really the same reasons as I said rogue.
---
Not a class, but I'd remove all dungeon entrances and make dungeons only accessible through the dungeon finder for some extra immersion. Also add azertite
---
In order for me to believe this is legit, I’m gonna need you to remake it with “Let the Bodies Hit the Floor”
---
dude NSFW
---
I take it in the context of a decade of condescending comments like *"Wouldn't you rather have more robust holidays instead of wasting development time fixing classic Alterac Valley?"* and *"You think you want Classic, but you don't."* To me, Classic WoW is coming far too late to be anything but a transparent attempt to lure old players back to their $180/year subscriptions.
---
I just got an email from blizzard and they want me in their game design team because they liked my ideas. I'm so happy :') 
---
It's not just the population, it's the type of players pservers attract. Your average pserver player is way more hardcore than the average classic player will be. My guild is like top 20 right now on the server but on certain classic servers we would be one of the most hardcore guilds on the server. 
---
Calm down good sir.  Take a step back.  
---
Tier 3 might be one of the few exceptions, because it occupies such an odd space.  I did notice that most xmog gear is locked out at lower levels.
---
Do you remember a guild called Children of the KoRn? 
---
Played Rogue and only Rogue for 4 years. Very excited to try something else, I understand people falling in love with a class but I just couldn’t do it all over again, want a new experience. Priest here I come!
---
There will be no beta
---
The holy trinity of dungeons. It doesn't matter what else you bring as long as you have these three classes you are set
---
Please, I'd like to know what was the drop rate for you.
---
I am really curious because I started to farm MC a while back just to get few legendaries (retail) but never seen the eye drop (even when I ran MC back in vanilla) and I've run countless times the full raid.
---
Then, for some reason, I was playing around with the PTR and I had copied my warrior which was parked outside MC, ran through it and dropped a binding and an eye on a single run. 
---
Needless to say liver almost exploded.
---
I am quite sure droprates in PTR aren't in any way skewed up and I can't find any reason why such items should have an increased chance to drop, also something I have always noticed in vanilla is that after a server restart drops yielded much better quality items, as if when a mob isn't killed for a long time then the quality of the items on the loot increases in time.
---
Please tell me I am just paranoid and you ran MC only a couple of times...
---
If you're planning to play a resto shaman you can skip these lines. Even if people remember you, they'll be begging you to join their groups.
---
I agree.  I stopped playing Wildstar within an hour of starting the game.  It didn't even come close to capturing my attention like WoW did.  I forced myself to play other games like GW2 and got bored quickly.
---
Having played a class on a private server doesn't mean you've actually played that class in Vanilla.. Worth keeping that in mind. I'll be playing all classes come Classic (something I would never think of doing on a private server)
---
Yeah I got the eye after around 15 runs, but I’m now around 30 runs and never seen a binding :/
---
Cool thanks for the update! Do you mind posting a source? It's not that I think you're making shit up, it's just that I think you're making shit up.
---
&gt;Be an orc if you are serious about PvP.
---
yeah because nothing says serious about PvP more than a lootbox racial :shrug:
---
I won't ever quit maining Warrior, may drop my alt Mage for a Priest to heal for the first ime in 14 years though
---
I don’t have the source, it was said a while ago by someone at blizz. If they were going to have a beta they had better do it by now, summer starts in 4 months 
---
Rares are cool sometimes.  Often, they just have a chance of a green item and that's it.  For hunters though it's really awesome. 
---
The gameplay, UI, layout, virtually the entire skeleton of the game you see while playing it is exactly the same.  So what if they changed a few technical things to make it "technically" true it isn't a reskin. (No pun intended) When one thinks of the concept of a reskin, what that really means, and from the perspective of of the players, it is for all intents and purposes a reskin.  Anyone with eyes and half a brain can see that.  And no matter how much irrelevant technical filler you clot your counter responses with, it won't cover it up.  It's fine if you wanna shill man, I just wanted to point out that the Chinese fan base of Diablo doesn't like it either.
---
Or mindless self indulgence straight to. 
---
I played druid and hunter to 10, and druid was infinitely easier.
---
They might not be fast, but they can overcome that by being able to heal.  If you blow all your mana on wrath and moonfire then they suck.  But even then, I was able to get mana back to heal before I died.
---
Hunter has the same armor and virtually the same close-range damage potential with no heal.
---
That's good for alts, but it can be expensive for your first toon.
---
Yeah but I'm playing horde right now!
---
Without the ability to get teleported out of the instance like on private (assuming there's not a different method available because what's done on private most certainly wasn't possible in retail Vanilla) how do you intend to go about farming Mara?
---
From a horde player's perspective.
---
I said it was my opinions, and my opinions currently do not include Paladins.  So i can't make an informed opinion.
---
Could persist in Europe, but I'm pretty sure "Damage dealer" was the phrase used before we started measuring "damage per second." A D&amp;D game typically wouldn't time how much damage a player was doing in a certain combat phase. Now us modern gamers just interchange the acronyms to mean the same thing. 
---
I'm in the exact same boat. Biggest thing for me was getting healing gear from dungeons which didn't feel fun because I wanted damage gear. 
---
There are multiple elite patrolling enemies in Eastern Plaguelands.
---
The shadowpriest with like 1000 mobs and the Courier with like 1000 mobs
---
This is literally on their own website:
---
"There is currently no public Beta version of WoW Classic. For a chance at being selected if a Beta becomes available, make sure Warcraft is checked on the Beta Profile settings in Blizzard account management.
---
If you are selected to participate in a Beta test, you'll receive an email with information on how to install the client and provide feedback."
---
Certainly doesn't sound like "There will be no beta".
---
Summer could also be late August early September.
---
I never could wrap my head around the damage of priests. They really melt enemies in the sense of the word. You engage them and poof your health is gone from 4 different sources. Pain, devouring plague, mind blast, mind flay. They just do so mcuh damage while a mediocrely geared warrior doest even get through the priests shield. Ugh
---
Definitely saw some arena there so partially it must have been BC. But it definitely follows the old school trend of way too much affects and processing getting in the way of gameplay.
---
Who’s going to open those sweet thorium lockboxes tho?
---
Yeah, but that was hardly an option as a first-time raider. I'm pretty sure I didn't even know about them. I have memories of VoA, ToC and the first four bosses of ICC.
---
Removed Death Knights.
---
Risky conclusion considering the previous sentence. 
---
did this rly happen?
---
Lol been watching Soupa vids lately on YouTube... Is that actually you ?
---
If so, you ARE a gem
---
The previous expansions and vanilla all had a share if dark and bright settings. Outland armor is widey criticised for being ridiculous clown suits. How is that dark. You’re just trying to nitpick problems with MoP because you don’t like it.
---
Id argue that Rogues are more necessary for Horde then they are Alliance. Windfury allows rogues to really edge up vs. Their warrior counterparts by having threat control in spades.
---
The Alliances answer is salvation which is far move valuable for a warrior hence Rogue is less needed.
---
They didn't announce it. But it was revealed in some side lore thing that I have never cared about.
---
EU checking in: nope we call it dps too, or at least we did on Sunstrider back in vanilla
---
They completely threw away this concept in Legion with Argus. Could not walk 10 feet without running into a mob.
---
(Yes, 'Overwatch' Making Both Soldier: 76 And Tracer Gay Is A Big Deal)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2019/01/08/yes-overwatch-making-both-soldier-76-and-tracer-gay-is-a-big-deal/#789c1f437008]
---
So which is better? The pole or the trinket?
---
Horizontal progression is the way to go, imo. This way, even after 20 additional raids, a single individual wouldn't be able to solo Molten core. Sure, a group of elite raiders would make MC a joke even under HP, but it would be nothing like this Vertical crap we have today. It also means new players, new guilds would have to progress through the normal path, through MC and everything else after, keeping old content relevant forever.
---
If Classic ever does receive unique non-timeline updates, I hope they adopt this model of progression.
---
And then find out that Blizz increased the respawn timers since all the noobs qq’d on the forums.
---
Wait what. I have wasted so much time. 
---
Always been a Woyer and will be rolling the same as my main woyer back in the day. I feel Blizz took away so much from the class and it's really not as fun nowadays as it was back then. So I'll be rolling the same simply to experience it once more and to transfer my accumulated knowledge into it's primal state.
---
I may roll a Rogue as an alt since I was always good at stunlocking and goofing around with a Rogue.
---
They'll probably announce that Hogger is gay just in time for the release of Classic. Can't wait. 
---
You basically move the entire raid up left side of the room with protection potions very slowly. Mages take turns with frost novas and blizzards and slow the enemies along the way while priests holy nova. Once you get to the other side you aoe all the enemies down. 
---
Source: the 'depression' room was bugged on a private server I played on years ago and we couldn't disarm the traps. 
---
I think most people don't as it has nothing to do with the game
---
Now I want to play warrior
---
I was about to say "found the Rogue", but then you confessed your crime.
---
I highly doubt they’ll put the fishing event behind a gear progression gate.
---
Yes. 
---
top warrior looks like a walking toaster oven.  I wanna shove a sub sandwich into his chest for 20 seconds 
---
All of these answered are wrong, and I wonder if it’s misleading based on the title.
---
IF YOU WANT TO GET DARNASSUS REP TO BUY A FROST SABRE OR RUNE SABRE MOUNT STOP LEVELING IMMEDIATELY.
---
In my opinion that’s the only way to level a human.
---
Go back to the night elf starting zone (teldrassil) and darkshore to get all the green quests you can, and complete those first. Then yellow quests, then orange, then red.
---
If you want to avoid the horrible runecloth / morrowgrain grind. That’s the best way to exalted.
---
Thus, that is the best way to 60.
---
Yeah but I don’t believe ZG will be released at launch. 
---
Since the fishing event was released in a similar timeframe I would consider it likely that the event will not exist at launch. But who knows. 
---
you can do it in rank 10 pvp blue gear lol. you can probably do it in quest greens. 
---
I almost said hunter, but tranq shot is a must-have.
---
My next guess is Rogue.  Good DPS, but nothing they do is essential or irreplaceable.
---
Lmao I can't say I've ever been accused of being a shill before, I'm honored 😂😂
---
Gotta say, kills your credibility though after me explaining it all in depth and you still typing all that out then yelling "shill!!!11!!" to top it all off. 
---
&gt;So what if they changed a few technical things to make it "technically" true it isn't a reskin. (No pun intended) When one thinks of the concept of a reskin, what that really means, and from the perspective of of the players, it is for all intents and purposes a reskin. Anyone with eyes and half a brain can see that. And no matter how much irrelevant technical filler you clot your counter responses with, it won't cover it up.
---
First off:
---
&gt;So what if they changed a few technical things
---
You can't just handwave away the entirely of the technical aspects of game development by lumping it into "a few technical things", that's some /r/restofthefuckingowl shit right there and just illustrates the fact that you're just throwing shit at the wall here to see what sticks without having any idea of what you're talking about. 
---
Even putting that glaring flaw aside, that's a fine theory and all, it's not accurate, but I can see how you might think that without having experience in development or inside knowledge of Blizzard/wanting to just take a shot on what "seems" to be the case since you have nothing else to go on beyond what you've seen in videos and pictures here. 
---
But the fact of the matter is, changing a few things in a codebase *doesn't magically make it not share the same codebase*. I.e., it's not just a copy/paste job. You do realize you can use similar assets/designs (UI assets, UI templates, gameplay design concepts) *without* copy/pasting one project codebase into another, right? That's not how development works. I'm gonna guess not though, since you typed all that out anyway and were completely serious. If you already have a good framework to go off of, which they do, and enough of the game is sufficiently different, which it is, there is zero issue with using proven designs and elements that were previously developed. Furthermore, creating *new* elements to fulfill the same exact purpose solely for the sake of being new is some pants on head stupid levels of bad development practices, and would never fly in any competent workplace/studio. 
---
Lastly, you certainly can't speak for the average Chinese *mobile* gamer from a western perspective, they're so far removed from our perspective that even trying to parrot what you think you know just makes you look ridiculous, compared to the millions of dollars invested in market research. Even their social media is virtually completely separate, so any Chinese opinions you see on our western social media will be very western oriented and biased as a result. 
---
Feel free to set a remindme, I'm calling it right now, this game will be a resounding success in China, and I will gladly bet you a $15 gift certificate to your game platform/store of choice if it ends up being a failure. 
---
Psh since you’re giving it all away you mine as well tell them that clearing the elemental island before the timer goes off and hitting 4 pools then clearing pools in that general area is the best way to win.  
---
Now that I'm getting older, I don't have a ton of time to learn new games. I find games I already understand well to be time better spent as my free time is extremely limited. The nostalgia part definitely plays into this. 
---
The most commonly made mistake I see on reddit for people speaking English as a second language.
---
What, you guys are gonna gang up and put *4 INSECT SWARMS* on him?! That's like 200 damage per tick!! The horror!
---
Absolutely! The “new wow” and players are nothing like back in the day. Everyone grouped, waited for other in an instance, CLEARED the whole instance, genuinely had fun and RP’ed. 
---
Today if you don’t have the right gloves, you’ll get kicked out of a raid instead of trying to help you get those gloves. 
---
I mained a mage in vanilla. Played him a bit of the way into TBC. Rerolled warlock/druid. Made my warrior at the end of TBC and mained her until end of Wrath.  
---
On my warrior in wrath I was main spec dps and I tanked the 10 man heroic achievement team I put together for Ulduar/ICC. I have a little bit of melee dps and tanking type experience, obviously not on par with vanilla because of game difference, but I've been in the environment. And then of course warlock/mage make up for my ranged dps. What am I lacking? Healing experience.  
---
The entire purpose of me rolling on private servers was to play healers to see if they're my bag of tea. I got to 60 on a druid, learned that I suck horribly bad at healing, but then thought maybe it's just druid. I rerolled shaman to 60 and learned, guess what? It's me. I'm horrible at healing. It's like a shoe I never learned to tie, and I have no intention on learning it now.

My time on private servers recently was very well spent and I'm glad I rolled two classes that were far out of my comfort zone. I learned a lot and it solidified my choice to roll my warrior in Classic again and have a warlock alt. I have no interest in hunter or rogue. I'll be collecting both fury and tank pre-raid gear and whatever the guild needs I'll play. I highly doubt they'll want me to tank though as a gnome. It'll be hard enough as dps. I will be the guy who uses every consume no matter what because I have to make up for my racial disadvantage in PVE.  
---
I danced around the idea of alt'ing a healing paladin but... it would just backfire. I know it would.  
---
That hammer is probably the best looking weapon ever added to the game. On par with sulfuras for sure! 
---
I played a hunter back in Classic, keen to start maybe a warlock, priest or mage... havn't decided yet. It's tough because I don't want to sink time into a class i don't like, I'm leaning towards warlock but i heard sould shards are a pain. Mage will definitely be at least 1 of my alts, and Priest seems good for groups and shadow PVP. All classes I choose will factor in PVP, build diversity, QOL utility etc

Let's not forget the Silithus formation riding gang

Coming soon, from Forbes:

“Yes, Blizzard Shipping Sylvanas Windrunner And Calia Menethil Is A Big Deal”
---
Yeah I also wanna kill myself
---
And one moonfire!
---
Want to roll Troll Hunter (my original main) but I think the Tier 2 set looks awful on trolls (not that I'll get it anyway most likely).
---
Arena was introduced in the pre-patch iirc
---
Do people actually play overwatch? I thought it was just kept around for porn at this point.
---
Youre right, toally missed them.
---
There are two patrols in Silithus afaik. The mounted marauders for one of the combat or tactical assigment badges and the prophet with her gang of twilight dual wielders.
---
Pls dont
---
I feel what you feel, and therefore, if you wanna talk, I am here.
---
Barak gro-Bama. Love it. 
---
Well obviously you can go without shamans and paladins considering thats exactly what each faction does.
---
 I'm not sure if you were joking, but if you ever need to talk to someone who has been there, PM me. That goes for anyone reading this.
---
I don't give a rat's ass about whether or not Soldier 76 is gay, but Blizzard's decision making of late have been incredibly suspect.
---
Whatever.  Blizzard has been dead to me for some time.  As long as they don't screw Classic up, I'm happy.  WC3 Reforged was cool-ish to play at Blizzcon.  If they remaster D2, I'll be in ~~heaven~~ hell (again).

EPL patrols

Why do you highly doubt it?

My life was going in a crappy direction when I first started WOW. It was Spring of my sophomore year in high school and my first ever boyfriend dumped me. My dad suggested I try this new game he was playing to get my mind off it. A few of my friends from school also played, and the escape and bonding mechanism gave me something to really look forward to.
---
At 29, my life kicks freaking ass. But for some reason, that bitter, nostalgic ache is kind of what I long for. It's kind of like going back in time and feeling like a 15 year-old again, only like I get to tell myself, "Hey kid, just wait 'til you're a grown up. You're going to look back on this and laugh.. and you'll *still* be playing this fucking game."
---
Just listen, don’t look.
---
Always torn with this. A part of me wants a completely new and authentic experience playing Classic. Another part of me wants to relive all the excitement of each ability and leveling in each place as I did as a teen because I'm in it for the nostalgia.
---
Thanks friend! 
---
Don’t forget to set your hearthstone for quick turn in. :-)
---
Thanks, this is much appreciated!
---
Turn the volume up and keep your mouse on the bobber. Then do something else til you hear the splash. Browse reddit on your phone for one ha. 
---
God those are the ugliest, hideous, most *amazing* shoulders ever.  God I miss it all.

I leveled up more than enough paladins and warriors in vanilla to give you some tips. I have seen many misguides around paladin levelling. Paladin is not boring to level at all. "It's just auto attack and watching porn" is not true at all, and I honestly think those people never levelled a paladin in their life. Lots of guys who enjoys retail are enjoying the "rotations" there, but I find that boring. Paladins in vanilla are more about awesome utility, clever management, rather than playing a piano with your keyboard. The vanilla one is a better RPG class to play overall.
---
If you want some good aoe farming, and easy spot in dungeons, then go for a tanking route. Becoming a tank, your first thing to hit is *Consecration* from holy, that's a must. Then you can mix it up for that *Pursuit of Justice* and some retribution if you want, but for tanking purposes go for Protection tree (especially for *Blessing of Sanctuary* and more threat). I used *BoW* too while levelling, till I got *BoS*, which I preferred later. *Seal of Wisdom* will be a good friend of yours while tanking, and I even preferred it while I solo farmed. Many people will use *Seal of Light*, but I found *Wisdom* to be better (especially if you get the second tier holy talent which reduces push-back from heals). However, while levelling, you can tank dungeons even without protection talents.  
---
And I wrote warriors too in my first sentence, just to compare them. Pulling is maybe problematic on paladin, but the aoe tanking makes it worth. At level 60 when I healed through a dungeon with a paladin tank (Dire Maul West and Scholomance), I felt it was a much smoother run (even with lacking taunt) than doing it with a warrior tank. Warriors in this version needs more care with their after-pull threat mitigaion, and that's where paladins and druids shine (and keeping in mind that warriors are best at non-aoe tanking ofc).
---
The beauty of levelling, or even playing at max level as a paladin, is that you can make some pretty solid hybrid builds (not op, maybe not optimal, but FUN). I like your idea about that Retribution start, and then going for Holy (especially for improved *BoW*, which I prefer over *Might* or *Kings*), it can work for you, and with some healing gear you can easily heal instances if you talent it that way and you want to. Don't be afraid to try this out, but I personally would leave improved *BoW* (20% is not that much). However, both aproach can work, and will work. Also most of the percentage talents based on your stats are not that much when you are levelling.
---
[Here is something I came up with based on your idea](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A_wQMAAEMP3zdA). I think it can be improved, and I will not say it's the absolute best build for levelling, but while creating it I got a feel for it, maybe gonna try it out . *Seal of Command* is not neccessary if you chose a more tankier way, and with using *Seal of Wisdom*/*Light* most of the time with shield. I found that mostly I don't really use *Judgement of the Crusader* to make the improved talent efficient, but if you do, then go for it for sure. *Improved Judgement* maybe worth if you need that "taunt" for *Seal of Righteousness*. *Parry* is always good, and *Eye For An Eye* is just some fun talent when a mage crits on you. So I think that's the beauty of it, you can play around with it, and make it to your taste.
---
Good luck!
---
The only prestige sets are the removed ones, so people with Naxx Tier 3 and Corrupted Ashbringers.
---
You’re better off taking a direct route and killing everything in your path. Going to need that extra experience anyways. 
---
I mean yes, but the textures still won't be high-res and will still be "painted on". Even currently in retail there are plenty of original gear models that still have lo-res textures.
---
Shamans are Horde only.
---
I’m torn. I loved my NE rogue in vanilla, but I really wanna roll something else just for the experience. I did roll a warrior and got him to 60 right before TBC but I never spent the time to really know his rotations and all. If I did roll another rogue it would be horde, I only rolled alliance because that’s where my friends already were. 
---
Lol "massive microtransactions." And others like "jumbo shrimp", "bittersweet", or "definitely maybe."
---
I'll be perfectly happy with 2500.
---
Actually 2004-2006 was an extremely low point in my life. I was in my early 20s and caring for my mom, who had cancer, as well as my younger brother who was still in high school and has learning disabilities. Then our mom passed away and I became my brother's legal guardian. Not too long after that, the store I worked at shut down and I was laid off with no warning. Fortunately we had some money from our mom's savings and life insurance so we were okay until I found a new job.
---
Throughout all this the pressure and grief were unbelievable and sometimes I didn't think I could get through it. I didn't have a lot of friends - I think most people my age had a hard time relating to my life situation - and when I lost my job I also lost some of the few connections I had.
---
WoW was one of the few bright spots. My WoW friends didn't know how bad things were for me (I just didn't talk about RL) so it was a place I could escape for a while and forget about my problems. I think things would have been much worse for me if I didn't have that.
---
(My brother and I are both doing well now, btw.)
---
If Retail does die, a lot will gravitate to Classic. But I don't believe they will have the commitment to play. It may take a few months to weed them out. Hopefully Blizz doesn't listen to their constant demands and let Classic be as they promised. 
---
iirc you can xmog any piece up to lvl 60 from level 1 since a recent patch.
---
It's not so much the good old days, it's more that this is the game I want to play. People say the community was a huge factor to why many played wow and that's true. But for me it really boils down to the entire game itself, it is the ultimate rpg. 
---
If you want a good slightly more mature time, then roll on a rp server and pick an immersive name. You probably won't see tards treamers on the rp realms.
---
Yes, i did this during BC. Don;t know if it worked in vanilla
---
&gt; Perhaps this one department in Activision was allowed to go old school and we have nothing to worry about
---
Jesus christ. The level of gamerbro fumes-huffing to have such a distorted view of how Blizzard operates is insane.
---
I see the anti-Blizzard propaganda has been left to run wild. Every day I read players with ever increasingly disconnected takes.
---
They’re talking about doing progression gating on content for gearing. That includes BGs because there are gear rewards.
---
Itemization isn’t changing from 1.12. Mechanics won’t change. Bugs will be fixed from previous versions (no reckoning bomb, pathing / wall walking glitches fixed, etc). 
---
Why would a fishing event, with a fishing pole as a reward be gated behind content progression?
---
lol Reminds me of the one I made in Wotlk in 2010

Why did all of us just show huge crits and play bad music was like a requirement for PvP Videos back then.
