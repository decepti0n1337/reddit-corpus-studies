It is or a deep irony, or... who am I kidding, of course it is irony.... right?
---
---
---
As an experienced Loremeister: this is probably true.
---
Its inception of video games haha
---
Many quests at 50+ are travel quests so I'd do them along with dungeons. If you're going to DM then do your quests in southern Kalimdor. Strath/Scholo do the plaguelands questlines. View them as small extras, they probably won't give you a lot of gold but they will give you a small bonus when you're in the area anyways.
---
So basically TBC class balance without TBC content?
---
Oh like in game. I thought you meant they'd dismiss this petition because of the OP's reddit username.
---
It won't get that far anyway.
---

---
Blizzard has every intention of converting Classic players over to Retail. The Retail level squish back down to 60 will happen in 9.0 and 10.0 will reset everything and merge the playerbases together.
---
Did you really just double post this because they deleted [your other one](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6cktx/do_people_really_want_vanilla_to_evolve_into_tbc/)?
---
Having a hard time deciding between UD Rogue or Orc Shaman. 
---
Shaman sounds like fun because I love casting and also using a mele weapon. I'm not really into the whole cloth+staff class look and feel, so the hybrid of being able to zap fools with lightning or smash them with a mace really appeals to me. In addition I like healing and supporting the group, which Shaman excels at. However from what I've seen life at 60 sucks unless you're a resto Shaman, when really I'd just like to annihilate Alliance in wpvp and BGs.
---
Rogues on the other hand are in my opinion the coolest looking in terms of gear and weapons, which probably sounds silly but holds a lot of weight in what I'll enjoy playing. More importantly for me though is their ability to pick and choose fights in wpvp, and their vast toolbox of CC abilities. Life at 60 seems a bit better, and once I get geared up Rogues are very scary in pvp, which I plan on doing a lot.
---
For what it's worth I don't plan on joining a hardcore raiding guild, but maybe a casual one.
---
If anyone with experience playing one of both of these classes would like to share some of their insight with me it'd be much appreciated.
---
Cool galery ! I think the first screenshot is from WotLK pre-patch though, when Necropolis' appeared around all capital cities. How many epics can you have in your bags though, there's like 30 of them :o (last pic).
---
Source?
---
My issue with that is that you might not play with the exact same people throughout your journey to level 60, even if you are in the same zone with them and you are leveling at a similar pace, because you and them are jumping layers all the time.
---
One of the greatest parts of Vanilla is continously seeing the same people while you level, this will be nearly impossible with layering.
---
Tons of new low level characters will also separate you from other players in the area if you are high level, sure if you are a turbo-nerd speed leveler and you are #1 highest, you are bound to be in empty areas because there is nobody at your level, but if you are just a casual playing only 12-16 hours a day in the first week and you do some dungeons, some pvp, take a break to eat, don't use a shitting bucket like the pros etc. you might be level 40 with 200 others but see none of them because they are all layered away from you.
---
Most of the healing from renew, particularly once you have gear is from your plus healing, so it can be a cheap way to top someone up easily of on the move.
---
I didn't know about any scaling penalty though (you can't downrank below twenty though as you get a penalty, but once you are above level twenty you can then start downranking spells. Similar to how you don't get Res sickness under ten).
---
No, because I have expectations for everything I would purchase from another player based on these time metrics. I don't skimp fast players and I don't reward slow players.
---
It's been almost 2 hours since I've read this joke on the internet, thank you for not letting me forget how universaly usefull it is.
---
It doesnt.
---
Holy paladin if you wanna tryhard for sure. Best healers in PvE and beasts in PvP too. I played both and on the druid raided AQ40. 
---
Druid: I downrank my healing touch and use the fitting rank for the situation (main source of healing). I become a pro at pre-casting and predicting damage. I use consumables all the time to avoid dying since I barely have any dmg mitigation and no aggro reduction. I always try to keep Rejuvenation on my designated targets (tanks and melee). I always try to reapply my HoTs the moment they run out. I become an expert at managing my mana so I know exactly which fights I can use Regrowth and be generous with my HoTs. I'm in the upper-middle part on the healing meters. Still not even close to our best priests and palas.
---
Paladin: I outheal almost every other healer(epic geared aswell) simply by judging seal of light, spamming flash of light, using holy shock once in a while and just paying attention in general. In blues/greens.. 
---
Druid is good if you want a challenge though.
---
This exact thing has already been discussed and proven correct a few weeks ago.   
---
The values on all the DB's are from 2.0.1, all the evidence for this was on the historic reddit thread.  
---
The long and short of it is you will not hit exalted by questing. Best case looks to be 4000 in to revered.
---
No, likely not.
---
[removed]
---
I am sorry that you won't have you own language server. Your English is really good though if you wanna roll on an NA server - I bet most people will think you are cool for being German. Much like Aussies in NA.
---
If you kill a player or monster with windfury, all the numbers pop up at once. If your windfury procs but doesn't kill, they stagger. It's weird.
---
I mean not really... Max level healers can definitely be bad at the game, in fact I would say most do need this advice.
---
Childhood dreams are the best ones. They are so innocent... so pure. I still hold to mine as a presious memory.
---
Maelstron was the best! I loved my time there as Horde and the constant raids from Alliance for pvpv battles.
---
The second part of your comment kinda rends the first one useless. 
---
Why argue with skill description logic if you acknowledge that it's clearly off in another skill (SoC) that reads the same waym
---
Why not have the healer chain pull instead?
---
Bitch on reddit like everyone else.
---
Truly the wise words of the Hero of Azeroth!
---
No, there was PvP, RP, and PvE.
---
That's kind of my plan, but I just know I'll see higher leveled mages doing cool shit and get jealous that I can't do that cool shit yet and go hardcore AoE grind for a couple of days.
---
Thank God there's no Pandaria.
---
That lines up with what I've put together for sure. Do you happen to have a link to the thread you're referring to?
---
I wish I could get my hand trained for a mouse like that. Couldn't make it work for me. :(
---
Clicking both mouse buttons makes you move forward, so I used my W finger to click S (which was usually a weapon/shield swap IIRC, or innerfire/mana shield).
---
The Pandaren existed, but I don't remember any mention of Pandaria.
---
There was nothing to suggest they had an entire continent.
---
As long as it's just a "couple" of days hahaha. I plan on playing a mage for my first class as well. Just seems like a really strong solo/casual class.
---
I hope not. I want Classic+ give me some Kara Crypts!
---
That god damn halberd. It's story time.
---
I used to duel outside Ironforge a lot, and got pretty good at it. One day, my very casual RL friend comes along on a ZG raid, and he happens to pick up the Halberd of Smiting as his gnome warrior's very first epic. He's over the moon. A few days later he rolls up to me outside Ironforge and asks me to duel. I internally scoff; he doesn't realize the beatdown he's about to receive, or so I think.
---
Duel comes, I've got things well in hand. Stunlock him down to about 20%, the rest of the duel shouldn't be a problem. Except suddenly, I've lost. I have no idea what the hell happened, so I check my combat log. The stars aligned for him: in one GCD his Mortal Strike, auto attack, and halberd proc all crit, instantly deleting me from existence. To this day it stings a little bit.
---
Good for rep, decent for gold..you can always do the solo ones, gather on the way and stop at the hard ones...find a group to do those and a lot better reward in the end.
---
Lol guaranteed ban is more like it.
---
Same
---
I wasn't a huge fan. There were just way too many abilities in the game.
---
I read that they fixed some hunter pet bugs as well, also the layer swapping timer that supposedly was added.
---
Mate I think that’s just retail..
---
I thought you meant holding right click and using keys to turn to strafe. Doing that locks you from turning and you strafe, instead.
---
Isn't that what you meant by using A+D and Mouse since that's exactly what it would do?
---
Yeah why does everyone in this community have a stick up their butt?
---
Install WoW classic on your battle net and you can log on, all servers will be offline but there is an rp pvp server there.and that is the actual game not the beta.
---
Don’t, just go in blind.
---
I haven't seen a SINGLE person say they want Classic servers to directly transport over to TBC. Like literally no one to this point, what are you even talking about?
---
Anyone talking about TBC, wants TBC as it own entity, isolated from classic. This group of people aren't comparing TBC to Classic either, they're in love with the Raids and Class balance that TBC brought, and are OK with the changes it brought to community and world pvp.
---
I highly doubt after Classic runs it's first (albeit maybe of many) course(s), their will be demand for a "Classic +" that catches the attention of Blizzard. If anything, there would be a business case for a WoW with the class balance of TBC and World / Community structure of Vanilla, which I just don't see as simple as a "Classic+", there's just a lot to it.
---
No one wants to touch classic, no one. Please stop
---
Not everyone is going to join the same server even if layers are unlimited. 
---
Some people will pick the highest pop one, some will pick the lowest, some will just go with the recommended one, and some will pick the streamer one, some will pick the non streamer one, and some will pick the one with the coolest name, and others will pick the one with the coolest name which is a different one because they have different ideas of what makes a cool name.
---
&gt;but given these numbers, I don't know that you'd be able to hit exalted by 60 without cloth turn-ins.
---
That makes sense to me. I was a hardcore quest completionist and played a human character back in Vanilla. Yet I was nowhere near exalted with any of the factions.
---
They should just make each expansion an option
---
I'm at work so I can't test this and the last time I logged in I got an error and no server list displayed. Can you post a screenshot please?
---
You'll want fel stamina for pvp dont listen to this dude
---
Pallies are the best tanks for UD Strat and Scholo, bar none. Mana isn't an issue because healers also will be mana limited. Drink every 2 or 3 pulls. Big deal.
---
- no pandaria
---
- no dreanor
---
- no cataclysm
---
- broken isles, kul'tiras and zandalar taken from 11 zones to 3
---
- completely new emerald dream region
---
- 8 new islands in the ocean
---
there's one or 2 changes
---
Can you post a screenshot?
---
Videos from vanilla are as irrelevant as videos from pservers, classic mechanics are different. Not saying it will or won’t be possible but you just can’t know because classic is just different.
---
No it did happen on certain flightpaths. I don't remember which ones, but I remember it. I remember guides mentioning it. This was in BC
---
Those 3 damage abilities look like fun !
---
It was a HUGE miss step that WoD wasn’t used as a launching board for sending players through alternate Warcraft history.  Can you imagine if they had set up playing through the first, second, and third war?
---
And they printed that trinket that completely broke Aff AND shadow.
---
I was sure hunter would pull it.
---
Same experience. Human who loved to quest. I remember mostly being honored, maybe barely revered with one or two factions
---
[DM Jump Runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto) will probably be your best bet.
---
Prior to DM, grinding dungeons is probably going to be your best bet as outdoor zones are likely to be heavily farmed.
---
"The Sands of Time have run out, Son of Durotan... The cries of war echo upon the winds. The remnants of the past scar the land, which is besieged once again...by conflict. Heroes arise to challenge fate! And lead their brethren into battle. As mortal armies rush blindly towards their doom, the Burning Shadow comes to consume us all! You must rally the Horde and lead your people to their destiny! Seek me out..."
---
So many memorable moments from WC3.
---
Cheeky lil bastard
---
It was RP-PvE? That’s disappointing..
---
Look into the races lore, look into the classes. Choose the combination you find the coolest then just have at it. No additional prep required.
---
Get stratholme runs together, and farm orbs of righteousness. You can call dibs on all of them if you want; having a potential tank/healer combo leaves only DPS to find, which gives you all the power considering DPS is a dime a dozen.
---
Did you find this out by yourself? Are you like a psychic or something? What's your IQ, seems pretty high.  
---
Of course I did duh, what else?
---
Im pretty sure they are planning on a lot of layers tbh, in the stress test they were testing out heavy layering and how it feels to players. So wouldn’t be surprised lol.
---
Just mad because they can't play yet lol
---
I mean the game is releasable now, so I'm at concerned they will likely be able to conquer the remaining major bugs
---
Just play on the EU French servers
---
There will be pain... oh so much pain...
---
I would love to but I'm at work too. I'll do so when I get home tonight sorry my dude.
---
Then you force RPers to roll on a PvP server and you have the reverse problem. You need one of each.
---
Yeeep and only the one. People were speculating that the stress test was a dry run for the name reservations as it released early, but wouldn't let people log into characters and there were only 21 realms. :/
---
Wrong. Story-wise, it was first used by Blackhand before WC1 when he was 'declared' Warchief by the Shadow Council, before the course of the first war. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Your point is moot as the first uttering of 'For the Horde' predates the Sylvanas WC3 quote by not years, **but entire decades**. Quit clinging onto it.
---
*Rise of the Horde* chronicles this in nice detail. 
---
&gt;***"My orcish brothers and sisters!" Blackhand cried. "You honor me, I will prove a worthy Warchief of this vast sea of noble warriors. Day by day, we improve our weapons and armor. And now, we reject the unpredictable elements and embrace true power - power that our warlocks control and wield without groveling or scraping to anyone or anything. This is liberation! This is strength! We are of one purpose, one clear focus. We will wipe the Draenei from our lands. They will be unable to resist this tide of warriors and warlocks, this sweeping Horde. We are their worst nightmare. To battle!"***  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;***He lifted his arms and shouted, "For the Horde!"***  
---
&gt;***And thousands of impassioned voices cried, "For the Horde! For the Horde!*** **For the Horde!!*****"***
---
There is the hard evidence. Nothing more needs to be said.
---
I disagree. There's not really much to the three wars that we don't already get in-game.
---
One of the Brewmaster's quotes is 'For Pandaria!'
---
I was hoping Warcraft 3 Reforged would be out before classic TBH so I could even more excited than I am.
---
Run Stratholme and reserve at least one Righteous Orb each.
---
How is Classic different? They're recreating the game, if Blizzard isn't working like it's suppose to then they'll have to fix it ofc.
---
Thew website itself says they'll release the server names before the name reservations, but I wouldn't expect those to drop until August.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
Pulling at 80% while drinking should mean that the healer should be full by the time the mobs reach the tank.
---
They've said they want to keep server caps similar to what Vanilla was, they didn't say exactly 3k, that would be ideal, but I really hope they don't go over 4-5k.
---
Never been fond of TBC. However it implemented several class balance that made specs more viable across the board. Also BElfs.
---
3k per faction per realm seems reasonable.
---
to be fair that could just be an island
---
No, just Arenas added or something like that. It still must stay what Vanilla was/is.
---
I always went Orc for the extra pet damage.
---
Or a feral druid :D
---
lmfao
---
Plague bloom should be higher too
---
You stop caring about what other people are doing and what they think about what you're up to? Seriously, who gives a fuck about the opinion of strangers. I'm rolling Hunter as my main because I love PvPing on them. I'll roll a Druid alt and tank because fuck you, I'll be a god damn bear! I'll roll a mage because again kiting is my jam and I don't care how many other mages are out there as it's *fun*.
---
This ^. Remember to pummel Ennervate cast by the last boss.
---
&gt; Hide and Seek by Namie Amuro
---
Gotta get those transmogs man.
---
Only thing I'm concerned with is the day I get to sit down and play. I don't care about bugs
---
Oh man, younger me thought this was literally the best video on YouTube. Now that I am a grumpy old killjoy, it all comes off a little bit cringey. Like, it's still *good*, and probably one of the best examples of WoW machinima, but all the wire fu just kinda doesn't do it for me anymore.
---
That sounds delightful. Level 59 PvP was the absolute best I'd ever had. 
---
I quit WoW shortly after Death Knights ruined it.
---
The classes were nowhere near balanced during Vanilla and there was no resilience. Arena could not exist during Vanilla.
---
The Kanker Sisters should be the alliance who tries to gank them.
---
Oh yeah on the alt thing.  I'm going to have a character I play w/ her, and only here, and another guy I play when she doesn't want to play.  For sure.
---
There were a lot of good things about TBC. Guild banks, Tier items, class spec balances, jewelcrafting, summoning at meeting stones, Mr Pinchy, heroics, raid sizes, etc. there are a lot of really good quality of life upgrades that really improved the base game. I would like to see the implementation of some of those, and they dont have to break the feel of classic to do so.
---
Over the past week somebody just set a new record on pservers for fastest 60 at 2 days 17 hours. One his grinding spots won't be possible in Classic and it might take a bit longer, but that is still well short of anything that would be impossible to stay up for (though if your leveling that fast it probably isn't even worth it to do so as your would be so far ahead of everyone).
---
Three times man, you always tell me to do it three times
---
I believe that orcs would have a better chance of taking the cake, since they have 5 fingers instead of 3. This would allow them to more easily hold the cake from the underside and maintain better balance, leaving their other hand to perform tasks and aid in their escape.
---
I’m gonna need video proof
---
Both hunter and priest have their class weapon quests in game, so it's really up to what she wants to play. Lady Orcs look awesome and could crush a watermelon between those thighs, tauren ladies are adorable, undead and troll ladies look awesome and both have great dances. If she's all about the looks, she should pick her fav race/racial mount then pick which class from there. Trolls were my fav for how sassy they acted paired with fun CC choices and my fav dance. It helps that they can be priests or hunter. :D
---
Hey. That's me. (:
---
If the community "splits", people are allowed to play the xpac they prefer.
---
There was a pretty cool trick where you could spec a lock into demo to get pet sacrifice. Sacrifice a succubus for 20% shadow damage, then res your pet with cables. I’m pretty sure that was patched :(
---
Then no Arenas.
---
what does ratchet shortcut mean? how does that shortcut work? :o
---
Dude I cannot recommend these games enough. there is a drought in quality  games, games that are genuinely fun for hours on end. If you never played Dark Souls and are dying of boredom, these games are your salvation.
---
Given that the RP ruleset isn't really enforced by Blizz, the only thing that'll make a server an RP one is if people are actively and publicly RPing on it. All you need is an agreement on where to roll and people not giving a shit about trolls trying to ruin their fun. IMO, rp trolls are a delight to work around in RP as now your characters have the village idiot to ponder over and laugh at.
---
I would argue all of the runs doable by mage are more than doable by a warlock since they also have aoe’s plus pets and they can sacrifice boidwalker for shield instant summon another game one with the talent and immediately sac it again for another shield.  Very doable
---
i doubt blizzard would ever release a class to a new race and then only have the 'alternate' cosmetic spells for them, but that'd be a great idea for gameplay balance sake. they could even tie them to a new militant arm of the cult of the forgotten shadow for the organized religion aspect
---
Because of things like leeway, which this post is about.
---
That's true.
---
*Cries in Tauren hunter**
---
Nah. I'd rather do this 2 year run of classi  wow.
---
Then after naxx has been open for long enough for lots to kill KT. Announce a fresh and let that run 2 yrs. That's 4 years of solid hobby for me.
---
Too many carebears for that, IC or otherwise.
---
Sure I was talking about the speed runs specifically thou. Pummle can work but kick more reliable (lower CD and energy vs rage).
---
Wasn't it stated by the Devs that Lore-wise all Undead Priests are Shadow Priests and those that do use the light are basically burning up whenever they use it?
---
I'd laugh if the release got postponed a week.
---
Ofc its not vanilla. What a stupid statement. If you dont like it dont play it, i dont get why every single post on this subreddit is either whining about blizzard ruining classic or its about how bad other expansions are. Get a fucking life and stop worrying about shit you cant change. If They add TBC im sure There Will still retail classic realms but TBC was a Golden expansion and though its not vanilla it had so much Else, like better rated and arenas. Much mord Content honestly
---
I'm stuggling with this too. But I think you have to play on the same faction with your friends. What about a human or dwarf warrior? (Dwarves are probably as brutal against rogues as orcs are, since you can stoneform out of blind.)
---
(I wouldn't be able to bring myself to make a gnome.)
---
It's not hard to host casual events within the safety of a city or instance. Anywhere that's a contested zone would be a place someone ICly expects to run into the enemy.
---
Yeah man I did all the same leg work about a week ago. Theres quite a few old thottbot comments that confirm the low rep returns. It seems like Blizz stealth buffed rep gains in the pre-TBC prepatch. 
---
I got exalted with Darn at 44 as a human on a pserver and was super stoked to do it again on Classic but it doesn't look like its gonna be possible. 
---
I've accepted that its gonna be a gold sink at 60 regardless of what you do.
---
Play what you want, seriously who cares.  
---
The META has changed, you can play any class now just fine.  
---
People have learnt to itemize and spec correctly, the idiots who think classic is full of broken classes and specs are idiots who never learnt to play their class properly back in the day, don't listen to them.  
---
Majority of the people perpetuating the broken class myth have never played classic and are just repeating misinformation they've heard.  
---
I mean my guild literally did 25 man molten core last night in pre bis gear to challenge ourselves.  
---
Unless your in a 0.1% guild literally no one will give a shit what you play.
---
Already tested in the beta
---
I don't think TBC servers would work on their own.
---
They'd need to progress Vanilla servers onto TBC to give it a decent foundation, and that'd piss a lot of people off and kinda defeat the point of Classic in the first place.
---
Get UBRS key offer sales. One of you goes enchanting and you soak instances all day with 2 dps, like a fury warrior and a mage split the ah profits. 
---
Whenever the priest and hunter quests come, you could farm eye of shadows.
---
I had to beat Princess solo as a guild entry one time, so I know its do-able. Took full use of all paladin skills to be able to do so, basically just beat her down by attrition/mana regen/getting out and healing during farts.
---
Not sure croc is possible.
---
I think based on purely anecdotal evidence that mooncloth might be more valuable than people expect.
---
In vanilla it was meta for cloth classes to roll tailoring/ enchanting in a large part, so lots of tailors making mooncloth every 4 days. 
---
With time, we’re more aware of the huge opportunity cost of tailoring vs say mining / skinning. We know our chances of scoring the valuable enchants are super low and that except for very few items (Robe of the Archmage) there’s not much advantage to being a tailor vs buying tailored items.
---
no. they have fixed a lot of things, some of which were very serious, and others were very trivial things that nobody thought they would fix.
---
they will fix most things, have hope my friend.
---
What email?
---
Ha, we used to do the same thing with Plugger Spazzring in BRD.
---
You know you don't have to comment? Like get a life nerd.
---
I would say there was a ton of content relating to the first war we never see much reference to in game and would make for an awesome expansion.  It would be like CoT Durnholde, but most of the southern eastern kingdoms south of Blackrock Spire.  
---
There’s a literal war going on, so plenty of opportunity there for PvP, and no flying mounts to maintain chronology.  The Hordes side of the expansion is all about their expansion from Swamp of Sorrows, sacking Grand Hamlet and Sunnyglade (current deadwind pass and darkahire) hunting down Griselda and Turok in the dead mines. You have the alliance finding the Tome of Divinity with Lothar, taking out a Sargeras possessed Medihv, and the whole thing concludes with the sacking of Stormwind.  Do some creative writing so both factions get a nice point of view for events, 
---
That’s what I would have liked to see anyway instead of “welp, we killed the past version of the WC2 clan leaders, and Gul’dan got sucked in to the main time line”.
---
Upvoted for upvoting and general positive attitude
---
Tauren have a light god, Anshe, which is why they are pallys and priests in retail
---
Don't let this sub get you down. The way the elitists on here talk you'd think no enhancement shaman, ret paladins, or boomkins are ever permitted within 200 yards of a raid or dungeon. There will be spots for every race, spec, and creed just like there was in vanilla. 
---
I'm rolling a druid so I can tank and heal. Yeah, it's not always the best choice for either but damn is it fun.
---
I wish blizzard would make a blog post about it already. It's crazy how few people understand this.
---
I also wish the Reddit moderators would delete all these and just sticky a layering bitching thread.
---
There's no way you'll be exalted by 4X imo. Not without turn ins.
---
How hard was mage questing in teldrassil? How did you manage it?
---
Thank you for the reply &amp; link! I thought that would be the case unfortunately...
---
It’s strangely a very iconic visual. I spent a lot of time strafing in vanilla.
---
What sad is you can’t do the moonwalk strafe anymore.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c315gx/reputation_gains_are_off_change_my_mind/ero3don/
---
Meh, I'd rather have new content than rehashed content already present in another Blizzard game.
---
Your post is garbage just like the rest of this whining subreddit. You like classic, we get it.
---
You've gained a follower my bro.
---
It gets more bizarre the first tick of consecrate is giving ticks of JoW atm.
---
EverQuest had the Thieves’ Guild which was similar. That was a good game man. As cool as classic is, EverQuest was such a great game for class detail.
---
Seriously, if you can't tank a dungeon pull for at least 10 solid seconds without a heal, you shouldn't be tanking in the first place.  Healers and casters gonna drink, no reason everyone else should sit around about it too.
---
That's not completely correct.   
---
The two damage splats from a SOR weapon swing are different.  
---
 There is a physical damage component and a magic damage component.   
---
In the combat log there is a line of physical attack damage, and a line for magic attack damage per swing.
---
For all intents and purposes, it's two attacks.
---
Why underground? Lore wise, highborne largely used the arcane arts?
---
There was word that EU region will have "RP, PvP and PvE relams". I assume America or Asia won't get some region-exclusive RPPVP servers.
---
it is something that does not exist, we all know that beauty belongs to Europe.
---
No idea, didn't play tauren on the stress test, but there's no way doing the quests for that mine is worth it. The problem is too many spawns. For the quest to break the weapons, the main thing I remember being irritating is how easy it is to die working your way over to the little forge you have to be next to to break the weapons. That's irritating if you're the only person there but might be trivial if the camp is being farmed like it will be on launch night. YMMV.
---
They've already fixed caster leeway.
---
I want to go feral druid tank, but I just can't wrap my head around the crowd pummeler farming and lack of real upgrades until P5. It is what it is
---
I wasn't there for the initial launch of those expansions. I'd love a "progress" through TBC and WOTLK.
---
Not even in classic + my friend. Dual specs and LFG can stay in wotlk where they deserve to die.
---
what if there's enough interest at  first but it dies down quickly and ends up a dead serv on PvE because there's also a PvP one? You have a ghost town RP serv when even FR and DE people didn't get specific ones, I wouldn't feel great about that
---
Healer so bored he's DPS'ing.  Gets distracted, tank dies.  "Soz"  Gives you Rank 1 Rez...
---
If you don't check your party before a pull you are a bad tank. Using voice chat or being in a guild has nothing to do with it. If you are a bad tank you will wipe over and over if you do look at your party before you pull. 
---
Running with a guild or having to have someone tell you over voice chat that or send you a message  that you shouldn't pull is sign that you you doing something wrong. 
---
In this case not paying attention.
---
You're the true hero in this thread!
---
Yes but most of the Darnassus night elves aren't highborne. Pretty sure they only remaining true highborne are the ones in Dire Maul. Most of the highborne trying to integrate with the rest of Night Elves were exiled and formed the High Elves in the Eastern Kingdoms after use of the arcane was outlawed.
---
I always thought it would've been cool for a secret order of Night Elf highborne to exist in Darnassus. Obviously they are a lot more chill with magic now since they allied with the Alliance, which has high elves, humans, and gnomes in it. All of which heavily use magic.
---
It would take a very stalwart Paladin to keep their oath through dead and such pain, but that fits with the whole unwavering knight of the Light thing they got going for them.
---
In the Classic beta right now extra XP is converted to gold.
---
No, it would fundamentally change the econony.
---
Please Blizzard!  RP-PvP, just one server!!
---
Looks like fucking garbage
---
Paladin is fine because you can run out and heal whilst she's doing her fart aoe. You resist a lot of the pulses and with tank gear don't receive too much damage anyway.
---
Not optimal but doable.
---
Boo hoo. Oh no, I didn’t agree to be their healer for all of eternity. If they found a healer before, they can find another one. People leave guilds all the time, and the guild moves on. If your guild is so fragile that losing one priest completely fucks your progression, your guild sucks.
---
10/10 good meme
---
You only need one pure frost mage in a raid. Everyone else should be deep arcane, like 31/0/20. I think the deep frost mage takes winters chill to increase everyone else’s frost damage, but it’s overkill to have more than one with it
---
They'd have to be moon themed and then I'd be all for it.
---
A good tank pools Rage before the pull is dead, so that he can snap aggro the next pull.  Shouldn't matter too much if Priest is only using Shield towards end.  You'll still get Rage from attacks.
---
The raid needs [one of these](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005--05353203102351051) (Winter's Chill, put the last two points wherever) and the rest should be [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300052310231531--053500030022).
---
You forgot Pandaria, which has been a part of the lore since TFT whether you like it or not.
---
Post was tagged as a discussion thread but thank you for your input
---
It sounds like he's looking basically at raiding too, and kind of disregarding other aspects of the game where different classes and spec shine.
---
Also, Paladins are pretty regularly on the top of the healing charts. Not sure how one could ever think they're outclassed.
---
Just go combat swords until 30 (riposte is seriously amazing) you won't be pvp'ing anyway up until then. At 30 respec for hemo and go wherever you like from there. There's literally no point in leveling anything other than combat pre-30 other than to be different.
---
This is great, I’m glad you posted pre-BiS and BiS because as you’ve seen from the Discord this question comes up constantly. 
---
Personally I don’t use the exact same formula, to keep it simple I make STA = INT = SP = 10 crit = 10 hit, but it looks like the Pre BiS is very similar. Tweaking it to make INT a little less important is a good move though.
---
Keep up the great work!
---
I am sticking my fingers in my ears and closing my eyes until the pandas go away
---
Is this your first MMO? There are *always* bugs.
---
Has anyone got proof that /camp works the same as pserver? I seem to remember the old invite/leave group trick landed you back at the nearest graveyard.
---
I stopped playing before it came out but I distinctly remember reading an article shortly after launch about the quests in hyjal being bugged to not give experience so everyone had to level in vashj'ir which was a laggy clusterfuck. However I can't find any mention of that happening now. Does anyone else remember hearing this or did I just make it up in my head?
---
I don't like having shift modifiers on those because it can mess you up if you have to use shift for another ability while strafing. This was extremely important as a hunter, for some classes it may not matter much.
---
If you remind A and D to skills you are doing the same thing in reverse. 
---
The turn character key is really slow. Turning camera with the mouse is much faster and more precise.
---
You remind to A and D because W A D is the typical FPS movement binds. 
---
The pro move is to actually bind forward to E and strafe to S and F. That allows you to bind W and A and still reach Q and it’s sorta easier to hit Z. But you have to relearn how to hit shift ctrl art and tab.
---
Thanks for trying!
---
Every single class gets brought to raids. Every single one. Even Druids, the poster boy of class imbalance and hybrid tax.
---
Typically, classes that have a harder time reaching the top of the meters have better or more unique utility in their kit. The meters aren't everything man.
---
The discrimination continues :’(
---
I agree that Pandaria should be part of the map, but those turtles were in Warcraft 2 as the Horde submarine before Pandaria was added to the lore.
---
&gt; 100% sure you didn't give a shit
---
I'm sorry, but I absolutely cared about percentage increases like the human 5% spirit bonus for my priest.  When I saw that, Dwarf wasn't even an option, Fear Ward be damned.
---
The record on an empty server is 4 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes. Basically 5 days, nobody is staying awake that long.
---
Cata was all him and swifty
---
If this ever happened it would need to require a long grind/quest line and be expensive like an epic mount is.
---
croc is way easier than princess
---
I can hear this image.
---
S is good as a target macro button. 
---
When I raided real fights, you have a target macro for the instance with all the burn targets. Spam S when the mob is supposed to spawn and your target will swap asap without needing to move our mouse.
---
Thanks buddy! It's not necessarily because we don't know English or because we have something against English speaking people. 
---
It's rather because we want that nostalgia, all the NPCs and Item names and all the interactions with other people in German. We have our own abbreviations and everything. It's part of the nostalgia. And we all want to play because of that sweet nostalgia. I would kind of feel disconnected to the game if everything was suddenly in English... if you know what I mean.
---
On a private server with 133% XP gains killing mobs that don’t exist in Classic that had an accelerated respawn rate...other than that, it’s the exact same thing.
---
I doubt they'd continue with Classic's story along side having Retail. At the most we can hope for a WoW 2.0 where developments stops on Retail, servers are shut down for Retail and Classic and a new game is released with lessons learned from Retail's decline and Classic's popularity. I mean, FF did it so why not a World of Warcraft: A Realm Reborn?  
---
I know back in the day we were all excited for the mysterious Titan project with promises of our WoW toons being ported to the new game before it all got scrapped for Overwatch.
---
Well I leveled up in Vashj'ir on launch day and had no issues. It was somewhat busy, but that was about it.
---
I no joke started a full blown investigation, why the heck retail is so bad. I analise graphics, gameplay, narrative, visuals, art direction, game desighn phylosophies behind both game, look for interviews with devs etc. I need to know what went wrong, why the game died, why it became so bland and boring in the first place. And what will be the best way to develop vanila post launch. I managed to connect a few things and here is what I found and what am I sure of.
---
1. A lot of key developers who worked on vanila is not working in blizzard anymore and new people who started to develop the game had no idea how much thought went into some of the game aspects and thier lack of deep understanding of the base material lead to a decline in quality in time.
---
2. Game having more and more gameplay systems not working with each other and more "fragmented" gameplay experience as a result.
---
3. A lot of aspects which created a dream fantasy world and made game more immersive and believable were scrapped and replaced with a lot of unwanted reality elements (like in game store, microtansactions, irl money time savers) have been put into the game, damaging the illusion of a fantasy world.
---
I cleared naxx and we never used engineering so its certainly not required for any boss, it just makes it easier.
---
Are you sure Gutgore Ripper takes up a stack? I know Shadow Oil doesn't.
---
Honestly, this is brilliant advice for anyone.
---
Troll sideways gangsta bow animation &gt; any racial. Compound that with the fact that the best weapon is rhok'delar until phase 3, so get maximum usage from the sideways shot.
---
Ok
---
Still good for raid v raid pvp
---
Yes, but only if it costs the original 1000g.
---
Rage from attacks is pitiful in comparison to rage from being hit.
---
&gt; Imp Shadowbolt cannot be resisted.     
---
But getting the initial buff ISB can be. If a Shadowbolt misses and ISB isn't up already, you could have lost an ISB proc you would have otherwise received.
---
Look again
---
Mooaaarr!!!
---
Still miss this show... One of the best ever :)
---
RothUI hasn't been updated since WoD, what makes you think it will work in Classic?
---
Goldpaw will be updating his UIs for Classic as soon as he has access to Beta.  
---
Classic is all the rage over on the AzeriteUI Discord.  
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/diabolicui

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeriteui
---
Technically it is possible for me, but I'd be pretty fucking pissed lol
---
Was it in Vanilla?
---
That was easy.
---
And also remember spells are on a two roll system. They have to hit before they can crit.
---
It will be a more steady gain now. Auto loot in the game gives you something you didn't have in vanilla. I'll be using pickpocket 10x more, easily.
---
Yes please!! I havent laigh this hard in a long time!
---
Do a freaking phanteon and for 1-3$ a month I'll pay you for this quality dude!! Douth I would be the only one too xD
---
Continue to wallow in single player games as I have been doing since Wildstar was shut down, then hop on the Pserver for it when it's released.
---
You can play any class in Vanilla WoW.
---
However, that comes with the caveat that those who are willing and capable of playing every role available to that class, especially the more desired role, will have an advantage over those that only can perform one role.
---
I've seen amazing Feral Druid tanks who have been asked to heal or decurse for some fights.  Baller Ele Shammy asked to occasionally heal when a usual healer couldn't attend.
---
In both cases, and many like it, there was someone else in the guild willing to take that slot if they were not willing.
---
Raid needs what raid needs.  You can be that snowflake, but at times you need to help out where help is needed or sub out with someone else.  If you can accept that, you will have no problem.
---
&gt; It just gives classes a lot more flexibility and freedom.       
---
Which is exactly why it SHOULDN'T be. Your spec is your identity in classic. People are **Shadow** Priests, **Fury** Warriors, **Combat** Rogues, etc. If you allow people to freely and trivially switch then that identity and "hard choice" is lost.   
---
This is exactly the kind of seemingly innocent change that will ruin the game.
---
3 across all realms
---
I love it. Mostly because this is one of the TWO WoW Machinimas that I've watched. The other... being... the infamous [Ballad](https://youtu.be/iz-RmSG2s1k)        
---
I loved pretty much everything about it.      
---
Especially since &gt;!It's technically canon!&lt;
---
My uni roommate used to do 40 minute strath runs when that was end game content, and part of that was faerie fire to chain pull back to the tank. It was entertaining
---
An interesting proposal for an altered realization of those zones.
---
At least on recent pservers Ripper would, but Oil wouldn't.
---
The speed run times from that pserver core and the Beta are nearly identical for all brackets between 1 and 40...other than that, you're totally right.
---
It works if you backpedal
---
Shoo shoo!
---
Is there anything confirming this? Blue post? I've only seen pserver data which as we all know is about as trustworthy as a hunter.
---
Will = Did
---
I found some [old forum posts](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1074268407?page=4) about how WotLK quests that people saved to turn in weren't giving XP on cataclysm launch. I think that's what I was thinking of since I remember the article mentioning people planned out that turning in a full set of WotLK dailies would push you 1/4th of the way to 81 or something before going to hyjal. Maybe the cataclysm zones were fine but the article I'm misremembering was about people not having enough quests in Hyjal to hit their estimated goal due to the wotlk daily glitch.
---
If the talent "trees", LFR, and farmville elements stay then I won't come back.
---
I might be in the minority here but I really liked the pet battles...
---
I'm disgustingly hyped and keep F5ing this subreddit daily. I also don't watch twitch streamers and know I won't be in beta due to no active sub, so I don't have what you're doing sucking out my anticipation.
---
Holy shit, I didn’t know that I needed Ed Edd n’Eddy memes.
---
*I crave more.*
---
All those people that want TBC. They THINK they do but they don't. It'll break up the community too much. Blizz will have to pour too many resources out of the main game to bring it back. Every other version but MY favorite sucks. TBC would be a waste of money. TBC would add things I didn't like. Did I miss any?
---
It was confirmed long before Pservers were a thing.
---
Warlocks can relish in the knowledge that they will continue to age like a fine wine in Vanilla in both PvE and PvP.
---
Animations and visual bugs are not more concerning than all the other bugs they have been fixing. This post is pretty stupid with its claim that since obvious low priority bugs aren’t fixed yet then it must mean no bugs are getting fixed.
---
Any use is good use, if you ask me.
---
You're probably right.  I'm going off memory from over 12-13 years ago.  Hence why I told OP take my comment with a grain of salt.  I plan to get a saber as a human so we'll see just how much work it'll take when Classic drops.
---
Pretty sure in some time you'll have a big patch fixing a ton of bugs at once and people will be like surprised pikachu that devs are fixing bugs and implementing fixes in batches instead of one at a time
---
I'm confident it was not sarcastic, don't worry!
---
All the polls for what people actually will end up rolling show a pretty even split for the factions. I'd say plenty of people didn't roll the faction they plan on playing at launch, me included.
---
The problem with the quests is you typically have to go pretty far out of your way/do a chain (usually both) to even get the quest.
---
Dual specs was the least on the list of shitty changes.
---
I played druid, Mage, warlock and paladin to 60 in vanilla. I hated paladin, I liked Mage and warlock and I loved druid so much in considering rolling it again for classic.
---
My experience is that all of the classes get played and good, reliable players are always in high demand regardless of class.
---
The ONLY way to play wow is as the class you want to play
---
Ok, let's compare hit vs crit here over a 100 spell batch.
---
You hit one extra spell, you recieve 20% extra damage because it hits with ISB up.
---
That's the effect 1% hit has.
---
Now later, you miss a spell because you went with 1% hit. 0 damage, miss 1 ISB proc. But remember, you have an extra crit. So later, one of your hits CRITS, giving you that damage back. Except this time, you crit with ISB up, making that 20% into 40% base damage. And you just refreshed ISB for every warlock in the raid.
---
Agreed that it must be separate servers, maybe character copy from Classic, and then WotLK separately, they'll all find their communities I'm sure
---
you just group up with any ole stranger doing the same quests as you are while keeping in touch with your friends via whispers, guild chat, and/or voice comms. everyone knows how impractical it is to actually lvl together lol. typically the highest lvl is responsible for helping with tough quests, dungeon runs, and mount loans.
---
Not at all
---
Not much point asking now. Ask again in 6 months when people are sitting around at 60 and no one is doing bgs and all the tanks/healers are sitting around poor as shit.
---
I’ve heard that too actually. Seems weird.
---
It’s very weird, just classic hehe : ^ )
---
It honestly wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Getting to level 4 before I left the gnome starting area meant that I had rank one frostbolt and one fireball to work with. 
---
I went back to ironforge at level 10 for my power spike, and will probably go back at 14 and 20, and at 20 I will have the ability to teleport which will make it much more trivial.
---
Time from 1 to 10 was about 3 hours and 30 minutes.
---
Same. I can’t stand what these current dr’d up ui’s look like. I like the good old fashioned style. I’m going to skip all addons for classic. - at least during lvling.
---
Cannot Crit if you don't Hit. A 1% reduction in Hit means you Crit 1% less of the time too.
---
It gets so boring and repetitive by level 20. 
---
I couldn't imagine hamstring kiting every mob while I level. I will only use it on elites to be honest.
---
I usually fight two mobs at a time on my Warrior and by the time I get to the next mobs I'm usually topped off anyways. Just get some +Spirit Food and keep Spirit Scrolls handy
---
Leeway and much tighter server side mob responsiveness (ie same thing that allowed frontstabbing) means it's a lot worse than private servers, and it was already not that great.
---
The fellas argument is you won't get 1-60 *in one sitting*. You begged to differ. I don't think you read what he said.
---
One sitting =/ staying logged in even while asleep.
---
I could not agree with this statement more.
---
Are you saying that Aussies don't speak English well normally, so when one that does you will welcome them in NA?  =P
---
&gt;because ruining other people’s fun is what PvP servers are all about
---
not really. The sense of danger at any moment while leveling etc is what pulls people into it.
---
It's like hardcore mode on diablo etc.
---
If you both have enough self restraint you could just casually play and level together at night after the kids go to bed.
---
I could actually get behind dual spec being a thing in Classic IF you had to pay for it.
---
I'd say more than 1000g though. 
---
2500g
---
...and Cleanse.  Class is baller af in any setting, just not the best option for pure tanking or DPS.
---
I got the Frostwolf pvp mount. c: I never got my actual epic mount until BC came out, then managed to top off my gold halfway through Hellfire Peninsula.
---
Ugh that’s a bummer to hear. I actually kind of enjoy doing it.
---
Definitely not going to happen. Blizzard has every intention of converting Classic players over to some future version of Retail and keeping them on the same subscription is the first key to that puzzle.
---
You're an adult now, if you can't afford $15 per month, you've got bigger problems.
---
Hell no
---
The part you are missing is 50-60 was complete BS on that run, killing mobs that don’t exist and that were respawning at an accelerated rate.
---
Going 50-60 is basically 50% the time uou soevd leveling. He shaved 33% off the existing Vanilla Repack record. Feel free to assume it’s legit, but it won’t be close when Cassic launches.
---
What level is your warrior?
---
Playing a class in vanilla is as easy as it’s going to be in WoWs history. We have literal one button specs, and the more complex ones have 3. You don’t really need to move much or pay as much attention to your surroundings compared to all the later installments. 
---
Mythic and old heroic raids as they’ve been since introduction are almost all much more difficult than anything classic has to offer raiding wise. 
---
I keep telling my friends those who are veteran players that if you want to play Classic then raiding is probably going to get old very fast.
---
Probably Joanas guide
---
Would be cool if I could play as a revantusk durid
---
I used to do a bit of Sunken Temple boss runs on my Paladin back when. But it wasn't that efficient for making cash, more just a fun challenge.
---
Well, while a 66% reduced price in sub cost sounds nice to me as a consumer its just not going to happen. They're in it to make money. Its a business. People are willing to spend $15 a month for this, so thats the price point.
---
If I were them, I'd see no reason to lower the subscription cost.
---
Yup, ain't no room for loot whores in Classic.
---
&gt;!Who?!&lt;       
---
I intend to have multiple toons so I have it covered. Although I'd rather have my Main leveled up first.
---
Just a heads up to anyone struggling to choose. You can create more than one character in this era-locked, time-locked-progression server.
---
Once you’re max level and raiding you’ll have an evening of raid content per week for months on end. Plenty of time to do it all over again.
---
For the light, b*tch!
---
I didn't get to raid Naxx, but the pre-patch event was so fun, I can't wait to do that again!
---
I'm not arguing for or against dual spec but this isn't really true. Maybe for casual pve players, but anyone serious about PvP was respeccing constantly back and forth between PvP and pve specs. A lot of serious guilds even had raids scheduled to minimize it since it was so expensive (raids right before and after reset so you had almost two weeks before the next raid).
---
&gt; and that Gnomes would have 5%+ more Intellect... 100% sure you didn't give a shit
---
Alright I played back then, and I hear what you guys are saying, but I have to hit the brakes on this comment right here. It's pretty disingenuous to say no one cared about stats like these. +5% intellect was fucking huge and absolutely valued by the community. maybe not enough of a deal to spend 8+ days /played re-rolling just to max some stats, but to say 100% of people didn't care about it is just stupid.
---
Can you provide a post on Classic? All I can see is melee being a two-roll for the dodge/parry/miss/crit, but spells were different with resist mechanics along with hit/crit.
---
15 bucks a month in 2019 money is a lot less than it was in 2004 money that's for sure
---
It's the single biggest quality of life change I want and anyone that thinks otherwise is insane.
---
spells are two-roll. we TC'd that in the classic lock discord (https://discord.gg/Q4KSt9). we also TC'd crit v hit and indeed, crit is more valuable for some content phases.
---
come join us!
---
It was 1000g in WotLK, that's like 100g in Vanilla. 1000g in Classic is plenty.
---
Isn't DM Phase 2 or 3?
---
DM won't be out until 2020 at least.
---
If only racial popularity was distributed equally...most polls/demographics we've seen show Elwynn will be ~50% of Alliance, Dun Morogh ~30%, and Teldrassil ~20%. For Horde, Tirisfal will be 40-45%, Durotar 40-45%, and Mulgore ~15%.
---
So if you want to skip the worst of the crowds, level a cow.
---
What new information is there to be had on a game that is 15 years old?
---
As it stands this type of material only stands in the way of people finding it for themselves thus dampening the "vanilla experience".
---
Useful sure, but because people overshare information nowadays the game will grow older, faster and the gripe for more content will persist.
---
Such is the flat circle we call WoW.
---
After the ancient war concluded the new night elf leadership. Banned arcane magic. If you wanted to cast spells you had to become a durid or priest. 
---
Mages weren't allowed in darnassus until catalysm and where still disdained. Darnassus mages where trained by the Shen'drelar remenants.
---
Homie looking to save $10 a month. Seems like you’re nothing busy enough if you’re worried about lunch money.
---
!remindme 50 days
---
A rogue that know how to play his class will beat all other classes easily that's how vanilla rogues are. Frost mage being the most hardest to kill. There's even a video of a dude killing high pvp rank players with a starting dagger and no gear. Yeah... rogues are broken as fuck lol.
---
Invalid argument. Classic already has features that doesn't exist in vanilla.
---
Rp-pvp servers enforce roll-playing. They're like regular Rp servers but also PvP, usually less weird aswell.
---
Wtf is a spell damage hunter?
---
Yeah they just struggle to get enough hit rating early on for raids. Geared locks from phase 4 onwards should crawl into the top 10 of your dps on a lot of fights
---
In what sense role playing? Like each person creates a character with its own story, a family ingame, a place where they live and stuff like that?
---
RP = role playing. Like DnD people pretending that they are their characters with some deep storyline....it's uh....role playing....there are different rules. Like don't just run up to the bank teller, you wait in line at the bank until it's your turn, that level of shit.
---
Makes sense the sentinel army and the NE celergy are closely linked
---
All I really want, if it comes to this, is end game 5- to 20-man content that doesn't make existing content irrelevant.
---
Maybe a Dungeon 3 set.
---
But you’re not getting it xD
---
its like a pvp server but you play with 1 hand and in the goldshire inn
---
It would be an amazing buff to allow all ticks and procs to also proc seals and judgements. Run in with sotr up and ret aura then swap to light and /dance as the whole instance suicides on your aura.
---
Someone pointed out this was during TBC, so who knows what level they are.
---
I hope you can figure out whatever is bothering you and have a nice WoW experience :)
---
That was my thinking. If everybody who wanted to RP all rolled on the same PvP server, it would by nature of the community become an RP PVP server.
---
Doesn't look like people agree, however. C'est la vie.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Roleplaying here you go
---
I’m gonna buy it from my friends in China.
---
Selling runs for sure, farming elementals, group with guildies to do cloth farms, gunna use profs and alts with profs to make money
---
Yo thanks
---
Paladins are great healers and pretty effective. You shouldn't have any issues finding a raiding guild.
---
afaik that was it originally. then they added separate ones into other cities. then in a later patch they connected the auction houses (different capitals used to have separate listings). vanilla went through many changes in its patches.
---
I could afford it. It's just not worth it to me given the amount of time I can commit. For $10 I could get an Xbox live account and play whatever tickles my fancy on that day not just WoW. For $60 or $70 I could buy a whole new game. A couple even during a steam sale.
---
That's the price competition in my head.
---
They want me to play retail? They need to start getting better reviews after dropping a patch.
---
Warlocks absolutely get  destroyed paladins, and get destroyed by shamans.
---
Have you even played the same game?
---
Since Sorrow Hill and the Cauldrons are two of the more famous AoE farms in the game I assume you are talking about the Shatterspear village. People farmed the Shatterspear Troll for Runecloth in Vanilla and they had a faster respawn than normal mobs, and there is no reason to think it won't work in Classic even though it might technically be considered an exploit. 
---
The Magic Dampening Elemental AoE farm might not work in Classic even though it was a thing for the majority of Vanilla, but we will have to wait and see.
---
Man, you’re dense. 
---
Imagine being so dumb you don’t understand the purpose of putting a ton of ‘known’ information into a single post.

Also, not everyone is sitting watching YouTube all day while they wait for their school bus to drop them off.
---
The difficulty of gearing and the differences in gear power is exactly what made loot whores in classic. Mucho drama, from gaming the honor grind to who gets bindings to DKP and loot councils. 
---
There’s smart ways of getting solid gear, but getting past a certain point requires real compromises.
---
Priest can do it easily. Just dot and run around in a giant circle in the water around her little island, mind blast when she farts, renew if you get hit because you stood too close.
---
I solo-farmed (~60 runs) for Blade of Eternal Darkness on a pserver years ago, and my biggest worry is that some of the packs will be in slightly different positions in classic, not letting you hug the wall to pass.
---
Holy shock is the best tanking talent for pallies though.
---
WoW has always been good with following the lore, it is the gameplay that suffered. I think everything that exists in modern WoW was mention in vanilla WoW or the warcraft games.
---
Devilsaur and tanking strat liv runs. One thing you can do is to res all the righteous orbs for yourself and your healer buddy as long as you're not rolling for gear. Herbing/enchanting will be my primary gold farming profession

I got ganked by a NElf Druid in Arathi, I spawned and one hit Ravaged, spawned and one hit Ravaged again, then again. I was on TS and my guild offered to help but I told them not to since I was going to log soon anyways. I ran to my body and just hit space occasionally as I watched TV for an hour or so, when it hit midnight I decided to res...and was Ravaged within 10 seconds. 
---
The guy sat by body the entire time. 
---
Maybe Horde gank more, I can’t say, but that guy sure made up for it in dedication.
---
Some time ago I installed a private WotLK server so we could level every now and again to satisfy the urge to play. It worked well but we quickly grew bored of it (and she grew invreasingly annoyed at me constantly spawning Onyxia in the middle of Goldshire while she hit the vendor.)  We found the thing we missed most about the game was playing guildies. That's the only thing that makes it hard not to jump back in.
---
I mean yeah ^
---
Also one of the rings is prebis for some classes I believe? the melee/hunter DPS https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=17713
---
Thank God for PvE servers.
---
RemindMe! 60 days
---
No, but I frequented the EJ forums and it was just common fact there. Same for Hunters. You could probably find it with archive.org.
---
Technically it's not just a two roll system because of resistance, but that's separate from your question.
---
I remember how angry people were (myself included) that some random crypt lord got to be a raid boss, but the actual OG king crypt lord was reduced to a dungeon boss. Apparently so angry he had to be reintroduced as a raid boss later haha.
---
It's 15 bucks...
---
I never really farmed it per se, but asthetically it's my favorite dungeon. The visuals, music, and chill vibe were my favorite. It's basically paradise.
---
If Activision acknowledges that something from 15 years ago is better than modern games, share holders might see that people want change instead of the same rehashed instant gratification garbage games and it's worth investing in, so pls use me as a stat number. but they wont, cause that will show the world that modern gaming sux,

That's why I'm going tier .5 in full as soon as it's available. I get a cool set and I don't have to worry so much about tier 1,2,3

Princess theradas our whatever you spell it in Mauradon

I dealt with it by trying an instant 60 pserver. Before that, I switched my mind at least 300 times in a week. 
---
By trying the pserver, I tried every class in PvP and PvE and learned that the only class that worked for me was a Druid. 
---
I wanted a healer/caster who could buff, had mobility, and somewhat suvivability. I tried priest, paladin, and shaman, and only druid satisfied me. Yes, I do get annoyed with people complaining that I don't have a rez, but I still get invited to groups nonetheless and heal just fine.

Dampen was changed in 1.12, it can’t negate all damage now, it caps at 50%. It was implemented incorrectly on the pserver.
---
nostalgiaguild.gg

You only need 1 person per group with deputy to be able to loot the carapaces. Since the mobs are elite (and you're in a majorly contested area if on a PvP server) people tend to farm in groups of 3-5 or more. It only takes about 30 minutes of farming for 1 group to get enough carapaces for 1 deputy token. So you'll be able to outfit an entire raid's worth of farmers within a few hours.
---
Deputy tokens are earned every 200 reputation. By the time you've grinded out the 36000 reputation needed just to get out of hated you'll have earned 180 deputy tokens in total. Assuming your guild has ~50 active players you'd be able to give a token to every single person before you're even 1/3 of the way through the rep grind.
---
I guess that's better than nothing.  It's more of a reservation for streamers, but I wouldn't even see them say what realm they are going on.  If they announce their server before the name reserve goes up, they have to fight with thousands of people.  Otherwise, people have to random guess a server and hope that's the one the streamer is on to steal their name.
---
Hey you're the only one who has to live your life but idk many people that like flakes.
---
Based on population alone, I don’t think anyone will break Joana’s record, even if they do, I just can’t see it being by ~50 hours of /played
---
That would be the double of original Vanilla. Seems a bit too much, but not the end of the world.
---
Lol @ all these warriors thinking they're hot shit and can get paid to tank.
---
Paladins are more than just ok at healing btw
---
I'm a shaman, I plan on going enhance, maybe resto. I am not discouraged by DPS numbers because I'm bringing utility to the raid and boosting everyone else's DPS with my abilities that won't boost my DPS. So, the DPS I don't dish out is made up by the rest of the DPS doing more.
---
Its $15 per month flat for unlimited gameplay and there's absolutely no way that will change.
---
I think it's perfectly fair.  If you dont think you have enough time for $15 to be worth it, then by all means find another place to spend your money...
---
Well, and winterspring 
---
Is my memory deceiving me? I quit at cata
---
??? its probably the main way warriors make money in Vanilla and on p-servers. tons of people will pay for quick key runs
---
“If healing/tanking aren’t for you then warrior/priest are out the window”
---
Warriors do incredible dps ...
---
My fiancé and I are probably going to do warrior/rogue/ mage with Druid. End game heading in 5 mans the best is clearly warrior. Rogue/Druid, when geared, can do some gnarly stealth farms for gold and are a solid comp for getting raid spots. Mage/Druid is nice for ports and water on top of obviously being the best ranged dps in the game
---
In PvP, you’re a god. In PvE, you need a combo of good gear, consumables, and aggro management skill to do decent DPS, and you’re never going to top the charts. Most shadow priests that get brought along just for shadow weaving are idiots that DOT (stupid because now you’re eating a buff slot) and then cast mind flay over and over so they end up being shit damage and their presence is only justified by the debuff they bring. However, if you learn how to cast mind blast without fucking the raid, you’ll surprise a lot of people with the damage you put out, and nothing is more satisfying than watching a salty warlock get out damaged by the class that is brought “just to buff warlock damage” and cry about it. 
---
Do it dude. Shadow is awesome. Cast DOTs, smash thots.
---
My guess is privately all the streamers who want to play together will talk first, reserve characters then announce it live like it’s High School Football players announcing what College they’ll play at.
---
I wouldn’t even be surprised if Blizzard let’s them in early to be honest.
---
Can't schedule a week of PTO starting on August 29th (just in case there's an opening day clusterfuck)?
---
Sorry, I wasn't actually being helpful. Back in Wrath my raid group had a meme (that I would guess was everywhere else too) that paladins could use a castrandom button with all their spells listed and do the same damage as mages with complex rotations
---
Do dungeon runs for dps that need gear (can also do this with orb runs) and keep ALL loot except for shit they need. You get compensated for the time they get the gear they want. The cool thing is if they don’t like it they can fuck right off because dps are a dime/dozen
---
That's a super old policy page. Blizzard doesn't enforce that at all. The only rules on RP or RP-PVP realms are names. Everything else is free reign.
---
FWIW, Mail is instant in Beta
---
If I end up with grandchildren in just 10 years something is terribly terribly wrong.
---
In my experience, it was like a normal PVP server except almost everyone had an addon that let them choose a longer name/custom title and a backstory and some other fluff. You could click on the warrior and read her little blurb and see that she was Freelance Kate Wolfwood, a disgraced Alliance Army officer who was exiled for war crimes are some shit. I didn't see nearly as much sex stuff as you hear about. Mostly people just ignored my character since I wasn't a part of their big RP guilds so all in all it was kinda lonely.
---
My friend you made a mistake in your opening statement that reveals a lot about your sincerity in this issue. If you have “0 interest in this game” then why are you here?  Why do you care how much it costs if you have “0 interest?” Sounds like you’re only sincere about wanting something for nothing.
---
Guy is a legend.  I asked hundreds of mages for food and water, and only a couple ever asked for money.  No one expected a tip either.
---
sure, zelizek is again proof of that, but enough to justify a playable race? even velves are a (imo too far) stretch considering theyre a very small subset of the mages of a civilization that had already lost 90% of its people before BC even started. the amount of paladins who have the fortitude necessary to not have their bodies be annihilated by the light and resist the constant pain would be able to be counted on two hands
---
its a neat idea for npcs, but playable would automatically cheapen the lore of both the light's strength and forsaken weaknesses (as well as raise the question as to why so many undead paladins are suddenly running around when one of the major reasons for their personality shifts when undead are being unable to truly connect with the light)
---
I wanna see the full pic, she looks so cool!
---
"rules"
---
No not really. The only rules are about what you can name your character. Everything else is do what you want, just like any other server.
---
Druids too?
---
To be fair, Kalimdor is just an island. A really big one
---
Thats sad man, join me in goldshire sometime
---
&gt;RP is a staple of Vanilla/Classic WoW. Not having this type of firm basis will be detrimental to the growth and dedication of the community. One of the facets of WoW, especially back in Vanilla, is the attachment you form to your specific character. Having an outlet with a firm rule set that allows for this type of interaction will not only assist in building a strong community, but it will also allow for longer time played with less content being pushed through. This adds playtime and interest to areas of the game that otherwise would not exist. Such events like In-Game Meetings, Weddings, Guild Wars, and EROTIC ROLEPLAY AT THE LIONS PRIDE INN are a staple of the RP community.
---
*I'm doing my part!*
---
Let's be honest.  Other than the top 10 guilds or so, people are going to be happy just with someone showing up ready to raid.
---
It's a secret.   I am going to break the meta.
---
I play Horde so if I'd be in goldshire it's because I'm stacking bodies. I wouldn't want to kill everyone's vibe.
---
But think about it!  After a mere 1157* trips you're in STRAIGHT PROFIT MODE BREW.  DID YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT IT?
---
*didnt use calculator, dont @ me bro
---
Im also playing horde but gs is the meme, theres no horde equivalent
---
not in classic, get that BFA data outta here.
---
SoJ needs a 38-46 mob to drop.
---
How many melee groups could you possibly have? 3?  Also, that isn't nearly as effective on Horde, because of WF.
---
My recent experience, was with a mage that felt the need to pull...
---
Yeah this one made zero sense. I healed in vanilla on a paladin. Amazing in PvE and PvP. They can just heal all damn day with flash.
---
Commenting to thank everyone all at once for their incredible responses. I think there's some fantastic discussion in this thread, I'm reading all of it as it comes in and hopefully it was helpful for others as well! Here's to our final 2 months of waiting
---
There was definitely minmaxing in late vanilla. Once people realized how powerful dwarf priests were, they were leveled en mass. Minmaxing gear and talents was pretty standard in BC.
---
MoP had a shit show moment when the entire alliance faction got stuck in the Rambo helicopter event.
---
Reading comprehension.
---
He said he had 0 interest in retail.
---
Please use the "I SPENT FOUR HOURS BALANCING CHAINS FOR THAT?!?!?!" scene please. Lot of possibilities. There i did most of the work, money plz.
---
Which one? I have more than I can count on one hand.
---
Let’s say they add dual spec.. where do they remove the gold that would have been removed from the respec cost? Do you make repairs cost more? Do you increase the tax on AH?
---
What’s interesting about Classic is unlike vanilla we actually know exactly how classes will perform by the “end” of it.  There no “I really hope they fix spec X”.
---
Any stigma against Warlocks being low damage casters kind of goes away because we know where they’ll end up
---
The other side of that coin is if you’re buddy really wants to be a Ret Pally in a bleeding edge Raid Guild you can quickly have that conversation that they’re going to be painfully disappointed.
---
It takes some of the fun away, but at least a paladin knows that the PvP set has a bunch of SP on it well in advance.
---
World of World Of Warcraft At War: The War For World Of Warcraft War
---
Blizzard, the digital pimp hard at work
---
WoW's lore isn't that deep. You already have Sun Paladins with no connection to the Light and corrupted Paladins with Blood Elves. From what I recall, they simply captured a Na'ruu or whatever the wind chimes are called and use that to channel the Light.
---
i guess so! lol
---
Paladins do damage?
---
Because we will get paid to tank. Especially when early on, when there are 10k dps that want to run dungeons and like 300 tanks... do the math it's no different then economics, high demand low supply. I made an easy 20-50g per dungeon run just by charging 15g for tanking and saying I want all the boes that people don't need and groups would gladly give me that for tanking dungeons for them. If you don't want to pay have fun waiting, potentially hours for the rarest spec played in the game that is required. It will die out eventually but early on p1 when everybody wants pre raid bis, your going to see geared tanks charging for runs.
---
A lot of people’s opinions will change in half a year.
---
The server is already going to be pretty small after the first month, doubt the small rp community is gonna get their own.
---
[Four melee groups](https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0ggvBshhjFsddddphjjFsyyycphjjFsspppwhhjFs), each with a hunter and a resto shaman.

---
I can for sure respect that.
---
27 no kids, no wife or gf, 4 day a week job with 2 weeks off at launch
---
Yeah I'll be going crazy
---
!remindme 55 days
---
What was the server called? I’m interested in trying classes but leveling is time consuming and I really want to try out endgame pve/pvp on some classes
---
in game party voice chat was in the stress test during beta
---
Let’s just stop at bc
---
Warforged: Reforged Limited Collector’s Edition
---
Not with the current client and infrastructure.  They're cloud servers now.  They don't have single servers like they had years ago.
---
This is because pserver nerds are the dregs left behind after all the good gamers moved on.
---
If you’re the biggest fish in a small pond, you get to feast.
---
Yeah, that's not going to be the Classic way. Discord plus a LFG addon will mean I do what I want on whatever alt I want until a group forms that doesn't charge gold.
---
You living the dream right now.
---
Agreed. I understand that this is classic and I'm actually happy that they're not implementing QoL stuff but at the same time, the lack of dual spec is one of the reasons that I'm not going to play a tank this go 'round. I can't bring myself to try and tank and PvP again. I simply don't have the time. So I'm going gen pop DPS or maybe a healer so I can still casually BG and raid without having to respec half a dozen times a week.
---
And thus, shaman tanks finally had their moment.
---
you've gotta be memeing. the blizzard community has gotta be one of the most casual in all of gaming. carries will probably be even more profitable due to this in retail
---
There's a point where you get enough crit with paladin to never run out of mana and become better than even priests.
---
I support RPVP for launch! It's vanilla! It's demanded! Make it happen!
---
Except classic is based on an actual working vanilla client they still have.
---
Blizzard has already said they will squelch add-ons like this
---
But I like chickens Eddy!
---
1. Prot is not required to tank a single dungeon, Fury is just fine.
---
2. Warrior is by far the most popular class.
---
3. You're not going to be able to charge for shit.
---
Engineering is the only that makes you better by having it, that you can't simply get what you want and then switch to something else.
---
Tailoring and Bsing have two options (Tailoring for +2% crit on the Bloodvine set bonus), and Blacksmithing is required to use the Mythril Insignia from the mithril order questline, but aside for that, the rest you don't NEED to be that prof to use.
---
Engineering though, always makes you better. Even if you just toss a bomb on cooldown, it's free damage that cost nothing but a GCD and can be done while moving, and can be VERY strong for it's CC potentials. 
---
Also several of the trinkets offer powerful debuffs, but have 1 hour cooldowns, so having multiple people who can throw it up is useful so you can have it on every burn phase.
---
And of course the Engineering shield makes aoe tanking MUCH easier on a warrior, and sapper charges as well for even more threat.
---
Not trying to be a dick just saying. You'd be lucky to get it by 60 even if you focused on rep.. and human
---
Private servers follow the same rule as grand villains of Harry Potter: they shall not be named. 
---
I can send you a PM. 
---
Also, a lot of people complain that they can get burned out, but since I'm not leveling, I'm still very much hyped for classic!
---
Just play what you want and fuck the minmaxers. Not everyone is gonna be the same skill level, and since the raids take 40 players (mostly), most guilds will likely just take what they can get to fill the raid up.
---
warriors are op dont let the warrior news media tell you otherwise!
---
Being part of launch by definition can't be a waste of time
---
No, they didn't. They said they would consider limiting the API if the social aspects of addons got out of hand. The problem is, a LFG addon only needs access to custom chat channels, so to limit them would limit just about every addon under the sun.
---
"It's on the table" is the official stance, as far as I know. At least this trilogy. Hope they take LFG out of WotLK, would make for an even greater game.
---
30-40 times would have had an unnaturally high number of people in those zones compared to a 1-60 situation, so that'll almost certainly not hold true for launch.
---
Except this is a joke
---
RP-PvP servers had the best World PvP out if any other server.
---
People from both factions would go on the forums and organize massive WPvP raids/battles. Some of them would be scripted and others would just be as simple as "This week the Horde and Alliance are battling it out near the Caverns of Time" or another random location in the world.
---
Forgive my lack of clarity. I have 0 interest in playing Retail Wow. So being forced to maintain a subscription for that poor excuse for a game so that Activision can try and regain some credibility with their shareholders is galling to me.
---
Nastagia has me wanting to play Classic WoW. But I don't feel that it's worth it at the current price point given how much I think I will play. I don't expect free. But it would be nice if it had some parity with other entertainment options. Unless you play a lot $15 is actually remarkably expensive for a single title.

What's Discord? An Add-on?
---
If you are overgeared for it then there is no point for you to be running it other than gold.
---
VoIP
---
Ret Paladin raiding is good for people who don't like clicking buttons.
---
As a ret paladin, you will spend the majority of the raid out of mana autoattacking the boss.
---
I used to love putting BAWLS in my mouth.
---
Well how else does a Prot Warrior make gold but run dungeons.
---
I just always felt weird asking people to pay me to Tank.
---
So what if everything feels the same way? I have a good job with good people. I work hard to manage and improve my software team and we make meaningful progress. It’s slow but it happens. I fight residence and usually am rewarded for it. The company I work for is pretty cool, it’s a not for profit and more often than not we do good things for society. I still don’t really care that much. Life is so boring without a good game to be addicted to. 
---
I know I’m not going to quit my job and be a welfare queen or some shit. I’d love to play 24/7 but I hate being broke. But I feel this is an opportunity to have fun like I haven’t in years. I’m going to die and I want to enjoy some of my time before I croak. Some people like vacations, or banging college age girls. Some like drugs. I don’t hate doing those thing lol but my point is everything is temporary. 
---
I want to play a good MMO. It’s hard to do that now-a-days. This is a rare opportunity. 
---
I’m going to take it.
---
Well said sir
---
Dual spec and LFG are hardly comparable. I agree it shouldn't be in Classic, but I'd be ok with it in a "classic+" -- whatever that may be. Definitely made being a MT a lot more enjoyable.
---
I always, ALWAYS upvote Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
---
Classic WoW will have way more casual players than private servers do.
---
&gt;but seriously I understand enhance is probably the worst raiding spec
---
Ret Paladin is probably worse.
---
Ya you’re 100% right if you want an epic mount first which is what I addressed in the first part of the post. 
---
I just added my 2 cents on what would put you in the strongest position as an end game player looking to take advantage of the launches economic climate. I’d much rather save on the hours put into grinding professions especially in the higher skill points and then have a steady income from a farming alt which would put me in a strong position for the rest of the classic
---
Nothing like a dps pull
---
As long as you are upfront about it. Most groups will not care (or just simply not take you). If you are demanding these things when you can hold the run hostage you will have bigger issues.
---
Here: https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2550
---
Keywords: "we may be restricting"
---
And they haven't yet.
---
Besides, even if they do cripple 99% of the addons to prevent a LFG addon, your faction's realm Discord will still be the primary way of finding groups.
---
The days of sitting in a city and begging for a tank or healer are over.
---
I only see the 3 old ones.  He is level 60.. you can't train shatt till level 62.

Tell me your secrets.

---
Yesterday, I quested in Durotar on Light's Hope while listening to Warcraft 2 Orc music. Nostalgia was high.
---
I guess the charging for runs can be placed in a few contexts, like you could be a pro tank and pocket heals and can charge a few gold a person to bring through pre raid bis runs for those who want to join a raiding guild but don't have the gear for it or patience to run it with similarly geared/leveled players. Or if you happen to be a very well known tank who can smack all the bosses in naxx easily, when their main tanks can't cut it. There are always those people who will buy people's skill with classes, or roles in content. I've seen in legion when I last played, high ranked pvpers selling carries to lower skilled players so they can have gear available to buy for them, pve content is hard to find sellable/buyable slots as most content (except high tier content for some guilds) are able to be facerolled. My guild in legion I ran with was not a notable guild, nothing to shout about, but we cleared antorus many times. I even main tanked it myself as a BDK and was fairly undergeared and had only minor issues. Thing is, in vanilla there's a broader market for this. However let's understand that if nobody specced as tank, except for one person, they can run anything they want. And being the only tank, COULD charge any price they feel necessary.
---
You could run Classic on a flip phone from 2007.
---
Don’t rush babies. Seriously. Fully understand your marriage 1st.
---
Should I go skinning/herb while leveling a priest? (then dropping it for my mains, tailor/enchant at 60) I know everyone else will but that seems to be the best gold making while leveling
---
I really went off course. Sorry.
---
You're welcome
---
then why were abilities normalized to retail values?
---
I was generally afraid of going off the road in Duskwood. At all.

I doubt it.  Somebody might be able to fanaggle some bullshit to get it to "work", but it's going to be on the current engine, not the old one, and that's a lot more demanding.
---
It ain't got the power to push it.
---
It depends on the city you’re trying to get rep with, as well as your own race. It very was possible to get exalted with Darn as a human without turning in cloth, as Darn has a ton of quests, humans get a 10% rep bonus, and they start out as friendly with Darn. As far as I know it was possible as Gnome and Dwarf as well simply due to the sheer number of quests that gave Darn rep.
---
But the reason you didn’t see many undead riding around on raptors was because they start out at neutral with Darkspear, and the number of quests that give Darkspear rep is pathetically low compared to Darn.
---
Time to leave this fucking sub. Fuck off.
---
I did, and it was about 1-1.5 hours per level as long as we didn't mess up a pull which happened a couple of times. Overall, was probably 15 hours played to go from 30-40. Keep in mind, no one in my groups had 30 BIS gear or engineering grenades. In fact, many of us were replacing items we had with greens that were dropping from the trash and using all of the bosses dropped loot.
---
It really isn't that hard.
---
i thought the leaf didnt drop until av patch
---
Hey, I see the healer is sitting on the floor for 2 seconds. TIME TO PULL!
---
Just so you're aware, there is still an easy way to reset an instance on Classic beta right now. So things like Mara or DME are still good farms.
---
To reset the instance quickly you log out of your main and log into an alt. You can then reset dungeons on your alt. When you log back into your main you are now at the beginning of the dungeon in a fresh instance.
---
As long as you are upfront about it before you join the group, you can do whatever you want. It's up to the group whether they take you or not.
---
The problem comes when you have the group formed and already part way in, then spring it on them. I'd consider that a dick move and more akin to "holding the run hostage."
---
I feel like they will eventually do a BC legacy server and allow people on the classic servers to xfer their toons over for free to continue progressing.
---
That's if Classic is a huge hit.
---
Couldn't you say the same thing about the whole of classic?
---
I got what you mean though. They will be faced with tough choices as everyone in the game will be eventually... 1) Reroll or transfer to a more populated server. 2) Keep trying to build up your community through playing 3)  Stop playing permanently or temporarily until interest returns (expacs in the past)

Here we go, 5 replies in and already there's Quebec-bashing bigotry. You can take your canadian discord and shove it up your rectum.

We were never world first anything but our MT was a Troll warrior and he was a bad motherfucker. And then later, it was a druid. Dont let your dreams be dreams.

I recall doing quests in duskwood, generally having a very fun time, I was enjoying myself. And then I saw the red letters *entering combat* mor ladim has appeared to to completely pack in my shit. By the time I got up in levels to actually do that quest to kill mor ladim, I felt very satisfied to finally kill it.
---
Did the patch make the content trivial or was it just as difficult?
---
Certain shields do if I recall. Not sure if you'd consider them weapons.
---
People love to spend time theorycrafting because it’s fun. But seriously, just pick what you like to do and you will find your niche.
---
I'm unclear about what you're saying here. What does you interest in Retail have to do with Classic? Blizz will understand perfectly that you paying a sub and only playing Classic is not a number boost for retail. They will know your activity on classic and lack thereof on Retail so you're not "supporting" Retail by paying a sub and only play Classic.
---
If $15 a month feels steep for how much you're going to play *then don't play*. Although it makes no sense to say you won't have time to play much wow so $15 is too much but say $10 is great for Xbox live. If you don't have time to play classic why would you have time to play Xbox? In either case it would be a waste of money. So either *both* are a waste of your money based on the tkmr you can play or neither is.
---
No.
---
No. Classic WoW has spec requirements almost identical to the modern Retail game, not the 2004 version.

It's a tie. Troll has better animations and the best /dance in the game, and orc has better racials.

what sucks most imo is that the lvl 40 cat mounts are the best. lvl 60 ones, meh.

sunwalkers do have a connection to the light, they just call it their own term, the tauren word for light or sun i believe. its all from the same font of power, including pre-sunwell belf paladins; they just managed to get around the 'you must have faith' problem by stealing their command over the light from a being of light (the naaru) directly

wow's lore is a clusterfuck to be sure, but it does have threads that can be spun together to make sense of it

When you first go to un’goro crater and there are the devilsaurs roaming around that can beat your ass. Always scary when you are fighting mobs and then you hear those loud footsteps.

Yes.  Its called BFA, included with your Classic sub.

Private server warrior here - It's crazy how often the dps try to pull even when you're going as fast as your priest's mana allows. I don't even invite hunters most of the time because 9 times out of 10 they're huntards who can't even manage to control their pet.
---
I got you, dam. As a nightfall bitch enhancement, fuck these passive aggressive types acting like holier-than-thou types while acting like the last 13 years didn't happen. These raids aren't progression raids, most interested in raiding have done these fights dozens some hundreds of times. FWIW the shadowpriest in my raid group back in the day held his own and then some on the meters. And in pvp he was a god 
---
You do you and these weak-kneed types who can't handle bars or raid compositions outside of mathematically perfect minmax comps forget MC to early AQ40 fights can be carried by 20
---
Having a tough time picking a class. I started playing at the end of BC, so I pretty much just leveled to like 68 in BC then wrath came out and I played that. 
---
Usually played a tank in any mmo, but it's time for a change. I'm gonna play a clothie. 
---
I've been playing on pservers for a few weeks trying each one. Priest is ok, I feel more needed. I enjoy the spell spamming of mage, and the idea of lock seams sweet. The lock is only level 15 so far while the other 2 are closer to 30. 
---
I'm just torn.
---
Thanks, unhelpful.
---
So many people are going Warrior they will prolly be paying to join groups rather then the other way around.
---
100% agree that would have been money. That’s being said, I torrented WC3 and am getting close to beating the main game and classic and it’s AMAZING. I didn’t play it before starting WoW and its footprint is huge. 
---
Taylor gang.
---
I won't be running with any tank that reserves any items or charges for their time and it was never once even a speedbump on PServers where this kind of attitude really started.
---
With the prevalence of a realm-wide Discord server and potentially even a LFG addon, I can do whatever I want on whatever alt I want while I wait for the right group opportunity to form.
---
Yeah never do this.
---
Where do you get 0.5 gear?
---
On Pservers maybe. Without BiS you aren't tanking UBRS on Vanilla as Fury with 4 casuals in tow.
---
It was implemented in 1.4, same patch as PVP system. However, other things from that patch will be in classic from the start (Gurubashi arena) so I would imagine the MC loot tables having it.
---
Could be wrong tho!
---
I’m late to the party so I’ll probably have to post again next week. 
---
Alliance - dwarf priest and human warrior combo looking for a semi-hardcore raiding guild.  We want to be clearing raid content with competent players in the first couple weeks but don’t expect to be pushing for world firsts and not overly annoying about world buffs for simple content.  
---
Raids Tuesday and Thursday with a hard stop at 11pm eastern.  
---
We both plan to no life it starting the Friday after launch.  Hitting 60 in week 2 and running dungeons with an organized group/groups for pre-bis.  
---
We both have AQ experience and are both avid pvpers.
---
Perfect.
---
This is very much true. Roleplay in WoW is not constantly occurring. Everyone plays the game normally, but if they want to spare some time for RP, they can choose to do so, and this RP won't take place in every aspect of the game. 
---
There are also players who do not wish to engage in RP at all but are simply looking for an immersive atmosphere with accurate character names and guilds being the primary standard of the server.
---
Considering I had no idea what Discord was until googling it I doubt everyone playing will be on the realms Discord server.
---
I have still been using Ventrilo all this time.
---
ive had this binding for 5 years now. why shouldnt you do it? it works really well
---
**Elite Tier:**
---
Bind E to forward, W and R to strafe. Turn with your mouse. Allows access to the greatest number of keybinds, but requires re-learning CTRL/Shift/ALT.
---
**Pro Tier:**
---
Bind Q and E to strafe. Turn with your mouse. Allows access to A, S and D for keybinds.
---
**Noob Tier:**
---
Buy a Razer Naga, or any mouse that comes with more than 5 buttons.
---
Unless you're wanting to pure max dps, you can run with an ice barrier build just fine. It helps more in bwl with vael and firemaw and just general survivability. Slow with blizzard helps with p3 transition during nef. The margins in mc and bwl are big enough that it would be fine.
---
I never pay tanks for runs, but if people are willing, good on him for making a buck.
---
The Righteous Orb situation I remember since Vanilla was pretty well established that there were a lot of people that went to Strat live purely for Orbs and you could call out before the run that you were only going to get Orbs and could reserve ONE and the remainder would be free rolls.
---
As for BoP drops, if you dont like it, dont join. I do think "reserving" is a bit unsociable/unfair, but then again, Im someone who underhandedly crafts my group in order to not compete with people, which is equally unfair, but less transparent.
---
I played vanilla right from launch, never seen anyone pay a copper for someone to tank or heal.
---
If Classic is anything like vanilla if you make it to 60 and are a complete dick to deal with you’re likely going to find plenty of people to group with in PvE, PvP is virtually same and basically all objective orientated by the time it matters.
---
Sure you might not be the best 1v1 against an undead as an alliance warlock, but you’ll force him to blow his cool downs so your warrior buddy can take mr.decomposition to pound town.
---
Be anything but a decent player, don’t be a dick and you’ll be able to play whatever you want. Especially in raids just getting 40 warm bodies is hard enough.
---
Interesting.  I like it. 
---
[I was thinking something like this,](https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0ggvBthhjjsddddshhjjsyyyyFhhFjsqsppwppcsy)
---
As already said by /u/inverimus, you're effectively unable to utilise shift for any other keybind while strafing, otherwise you'll keyboard turn instead.
---
I can only imagine you must have a very limited number of keybinds. If you have Shift+A bound to turn and you're strafing using A, Shift becomes unusable as a keybind modifier because your character would immediately begin turning instead of strafing. 
---
I haven't really played since LK or so but from memory I had 50+ keybinds, many using shift as a modifier, all of which would be unusable with this configuration.
---
The data was from 2.3.x iirc.  This is tbc.  The values were then modified.  They were based off tbc.
---
&gt;THEY WERE BASED ON TBC
---
More like runny snot
---
Probably wouldn’t be too hard to make, but you’d need it installed from the minute you created the character if you wanted it to track every quest and zone. What specifically would you want such an add on to track?
---
Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.
---
Well that's because you're a dinosaur boomer.
---
If you join any raiding guild, they'll be using Discord.
---
And when you start to ask why all the in-game chat channels are always so empty, they'll link you to your realm's Discord.
---
Discord is superior in every way. It's searchable, sortable, filterable, pingable, and easily moderated. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
---
Developers can do a whole lot with it, including WoW specific bots that queue you up for dungeons based on role. And if Blizzard gives us an Armory or some form of web API (decision hasn't been made), then another bot will link directly with your characters.
---
Damn straight friend.  The chaos of launch is always a good time, and no I don't mean like the WoD shitshow.
---
Played at launch in 04, never seen anyone pay anyone to tank or heal in any group I was in. Unless maybe it was hush hush.  I ain't paying a damn soul to be a part of a group
---
Not to mention gold needs to have a value, so respecing is a good tool to keep a decent economy.
---
While this is very true. That is a big one. However, if classic + ever actually happens, I hope that's the first thing on the list. But not in classic.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=7717#dropped-by](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7717#dropped-by)
---
Question about Dwarves. I noticed they have the lowest starting agility as a rogue. Will they ALWAYS maintain that deficit, or does it balance out as you level?
---
Zone explorations, reputations, pvp accomplishments, dungeon/raid clears, profession/gold making, mounts/pets, quest completions, etc.
---
Warlock or warrior with a healer are hands down the best duo combo. Warlock and Warrior are the only classes that get a notable dps boost from a healbot. Warriors use rage to do damage, the more you get hit the more rage you get. A healer lets the warrior fight more mobs which in turn means he gets more rage which in turn means he does more damage.
---
Warlock is similar, they lifetap for mana so they in essence have infinite mana. No other dps classes gets anywhere near the same boost a warrior or warlock does with a healer.
---
Lol @ an enhancement shaman in the raid. But yeah, if you're going to use that many Warlocks, might as well bring a shadow priest. Dunno why you'd do that though.
---
My raid comp's DPS blows yours out the water.
---
You can reserve names prior to the servers opening.
---
It comes from this list:
---
https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=questfactionreward&amp;build=8.2.0.30948#search=&amp;page=1  
---
Which was introduced in Wotlk.
---
Here is the 1.13 version with the modified reps to match classic:
---
https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=questfactionreward&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=&amp;page=1
---
You da man!! Keep us updated in August/September :)
---
First you'll need to level. Worry about that first. Not what these guys are talking about with end game builds when the game isn't even live yet.... Smh
---
Go check out Kargoz on YouTube. Look at his mage video for classic. This includes leveling builds and end game builds. Not just a bunch of kids who never played it spouting random stuff.
---
https://youtu.be/Wi-7oKvOM4c
---
it loses rep gradually, about 10% per level since it went grey, minimum of 10%.
---
it's still worth doing if it JUST turned grey, since you still get about 90% of the xp/rep.
---
Even in Vanilla everyone played Warrior more than any other class but Tanks were still hard to find.
---
Good ones were even harder to find. The vast majority of Warrior players have zero interest in being Tanks.
---
Yea I’m just looking for a frost leveling spec.
---
Alright, calm down now
---
Shadowgaurd scales with shadow damage and procs blackout stun. Hex of Weakness is also really good.
---
Professions. It’s what they are there for.
---
It really is. I actually think I will increase my income from it by 25% because of WoW so my Fiance will be pleased!
---
First, UBRS is a 10-man dungeon, so I'm not sure you know what you're talking about. Second, PServers tuned mobs UP, not down. Haven't you been following the whole controversy of people playing the beta and finding out elites hit for nothing? Third, the only reason to go Prot is to prevent and mitigate crushing blows, which is only a problem when the mobs are raid level, not dungeon level.
---
Any fury warrior that's picked up a set of items along the way will be able to tank UBRS no problem.
---
No it's grey on the bottom. God dammit you just powered of the exchange server
---
I'm assuming you mean an addon that tracks quests done, dungeons completed, zones explored etc. as there are no achievements in Classic. 
---
Several questing addons will track completed quests like Questie, pfQuest, Carbonite etc. For the other things I don't know. I find it quite useful to track the quests I've done so that I know 7 months later which part of some questchain I forgot about I'm on.
---
Its kind of awkward timing, WC3 has seen a very gradual recent return in popularity, while WoW had a very impromptu massive surge in popularity with Nostalrius which they thought they needed to address more imminently.
---
While it would have made more sense to release WC3 first, its probable that they only started working on it out of convenient timing, WC3 regaining popularity, WoW Classic hype feeding into it and planned downsizing of HotS freeing up staff.
---
Not a lot of bugs require immediate fixes, no point patching each tiny thing one by one
---
75s for water.  1g for port.  2-5g for crafting.  15g-25g for rare crafting.
---
Yeah I should have clarified, wondering about 1H weapons only
---
That video is for sure where you'll get options on that taken from some of the top frost mages off of the private servers
---
yeah Skullflame Shield is a big one.  can't seem to find any 1h Weap.  I think Blizz did it intentionally though, affecting ALL enemies is a pretty big leap from 'up to 4'
---
IIRC crit is better for raid dps and hit better for personal dps. But I dont remember if that was always the case or if there was a min. hit treshold
---
I never charged persay, but be upfront and I'd say stuff like "first orb reserved". I never put it on ML or anything, but if they didn't greed/pass, I dropped group.
---
Kinda nasty
---
I played a Rogue from Australia on the US servers with a 550ms latency. If someone was running away from me I literally could not hit them in the back. I was either in front of them or out of range.
---
Deep water. I saw sharks off a coast  and I was always spooked swimming when I first started
---
The roles are perfect: Ed the paladin, being the big lovable distraction. Edd the priest, always bailing out the Eds with his heals and preachiness. And Eddy the rogue, who will probably ninja loot at the end.
---
People will pay no problem. Just advertise it in trade and you’ll get plenty of whispers. Just take your pricing from others in the market. It gets me my epic mount fast every server launch
---
Troll also have the highest base level of AGI on Horde side.
---
In 2 months I will be, right now it feels more like the eternal wait
---
Zone you got the map, honor on phase 2, reputation tab on U. Pets and mounts will take a lot of bag space, but you can make a list. Also, don't forget tier gear, including T0.5 and T2.5.
---
He has 2 noses?
---
Warriors are a dime a dozen. Tanks are still snowflakes. Good tanks are rare snowflakes.
---
Warrior has always been the top played class but Tank has always been the least played role by a large factor.
---
As for the comment of "Anyone of them can tank a dungeon regardless of spec" that's just hilariously untrue.
---
Not only do the vast majority of Warriors have ZERO interest in Tanking, those who decide to Tank as Fury or Arms are only doing so as they level.
---
The average Warrior is NOT Tanking UBRS, LBRS, Strat and Scholo as Fury or Arms at level 60 without already being in raid gear. That just doesn't happen outside Pservers and even then most of those Warriors vastly outgear the dungeons.
---
Yeah okay retail is two for like ten levels
---
I still remember the first time... a shit show but a very beautiful one. Couldn't wait to log in and then not be able to interact with any characters or just get my connection dropped randomly while battling. Don't forget that they used to give us extra days of play when the servers were down! Haven't really see any people mention this.
---
I've never been able to post on the Classic forum. Something about needing a character of at least 10th level or something. Which is ridiculous, as I have a level 70 druid from BC, though he's inactive because I haven't played since then.
---
If you can tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can throw my hat into the ring over there as well as here I'm all ears. Until then I'll keep making noise on reddit and hoping the folks at Blizz still have people paying tabs on things here.
---
As though you're not going to use add-ons that add functionality in the game that doesn't exist in vanilla. 
---
No CD counter, no one bag add-on, no weapon swing timer, cast bars,  dot timers, unit frames, map addons, loot tables, threat meters, dps meters, Bar addons, etc.
---
Some people like different things. Get off your gatekeeping high horse.
---
LOK'TAR
---
Maybe in pve, I play lock and the amount of keybinds I have to have is actually pretty nuts
---
Pretty sure they said that was a bug and that it was fixed. You really like to shit on Classic.
---
Facts: It's harder to find a guild as a Prot Warrior than it is a Fury Warrior or Mage.
---

---
You can get the full dungeon 0 at launch but .5 won't be out right away. It upgrades that set into some epic pieces.
---
It's because they know the tricks and nuances to get around the BS, but they want others hampered by it
---
Well getting to level 20 will definitely take people less than a week, so layering would be removed way early if that was true. Right now they are hinting at keeping it around for phase 1, where is the need in that if all they want is to make a smoother 1-20 experience?
---
There definitely will be some but the trick will be whether they are ready to go at launch, because if they're not I doubt there's a way of working out completed quests, explored zones, money looted etc retroactively. It's possible they will make a lite little addon that tracks that stuff from day 1 even if the 'display' functionality is really basic or non existent.    
---
    
---
I'll guess that a lot of addons will track that stuff and even have armory webpages where you can view and compare through the browser. It may even be possible that a few different addon makers agree on a sort of standard of tracking and storing all that stuff and then all their addons are compatible with the same set of data.  
---
  
---
Your best bet if you're really keen might be find out WoW addon maker hangouts on discord.
---
I wouldn't call it a stupid question he is asking if there will be an addon for player created achievments instead of asking for Blizz to implement an achievement system. As far as I see it this is a good question that should appeal to completionist and no changes groups seeing as it is an external optional.
---
I'm just going by my experience leveling two Warriors to max and raiding with them in Vanilla. 
---
You are not playing as Fury and Arms while doing Dungeons at 60 if you're tanking. You're just not.
---
UBRS is a 10 man but it's still considered a "Dungeon" by all intensive purposes. I haven't heard UBRS being called a Raid since before AQ came out.
---
As a healer thank you
---
You honestly have no idea what you're talking about. PServers made shit harder, not easier. My Warrior alt in actual Vanilla tanked every dungeon just fine and never specced prot even once, nor did he ever get a single piece of tank gear from raids.
---
Prot is about mitigating types of damage in raids that simply doesn't exist in dungeons.
---
I always felt like tbc offered the best leveling experience, but maybe that's just because I was really into the feel of the zones and also it felt like a huge step up from vanilla.  Wrath was also a lot of fun as I remember it. MoP was well executed for sure, but there were a bunch of zones and quest lines that just didn't draw me in.
---
I really did enjoy brawlers guild though, and scenarios were a bunch of fun with all the associated achievements.
---
Why not just write a list of things you would like to accomplish on a piece of paper? Sort of like a bucket list. 
---
It's called role play really.
---
I'm 30. Hardly a Dinosaur lol
---
Maybe they should rethink their subscription   model given the increased competition and recent reported revenue.
---
put the points in anticipation or toughness into defiance
---
put 1 point from imp shield wall into imp shield block
---
points from booming voice into cruelty
---
why ignore all the good info out there?
---
That is the only way it can really be considered imo at least then it is equivalent to 20 top cost respecs so it wont be something everyone farms for either.
---
Honestly had no idea people had dominant eyes. How can I test this?
---
I don't know if that's true that you would need it installed from the beginning. Can the current API deliver small flagged facts about quests and statistics on demand (like currentPlayer.hasCompleted("Mankrik'sWife"))? All this data lives somewhere, you shouldn't need to be tracking it yourself from the beginning if you can talk to the server.
---
there was definitely min maxing in TBC. 9/10 Raid warrior tanks were Tauren. Belf hunters were not a thing.
---
&gt; You are not playing as Fury and Arms while doing Dungeons at 60 if you're tanking. You're just not.
---
False. This is exactly how I got my pre-BIS for Fury. By tanking dungeons, as Fury. Prot is simply not needed in dungeons, hell it's not even really needed in a lot of raid encounters.
---
&gt; UBRS is a 10 man but it's still considered a "Dungeon" by all intensive purposes
---
And yet you called it a 5-man. And it's "intents and purposes", not "intensive purposes"
---
&gt; I'm just going by my experience leveling two Warriors to max and raiding with them in Vanilla.
---
Well there's your problem. Haven't heard of Discord, still uses Ventrilo, mistakening called UBRS a 5-man dungeon, and still thinks Prot is necessary to mitigate dungeon damage. You were just bad.
---
Glorious Tauren Master Race.
---
Bogustimes pvp vid is worse. He holds legendary meme status on a certain pserver. &gt;__&gt;
---
Also mana shield and shadow barrier
---
Honestly the healer probably should be pulling in a well organised group, tank and dps both should be focused on dps, the one with the time to hop around and pull things and lead them back to the group is the healer.
---
Everything you are saying is only true for speed raiding, or world first.
---
Well, you're not a modern gamer, that's for sure. Discord is the king of all gaming communication, for any and all online games. There isn't a single guild that will be using Ventrilo over it unless it's so they can claim they use Ventrilo for the lols.
---
Not entirely true.
---
You have to stay in character in all chatting channels with the exception of your guild. You can't start talking about Game of Thrones or Avengers in General chat for instance.
---
I think reserving loot isn't unreasonable.  Back in vanilla this one rogue/priest group would be really the only people putting together UBRS groups and he was claiming the rend main hand.  Wasn't really that big of a deal because the rest of the gear was 100% up for grabs and distributed.
---
Those runs always went down flawless, never had issues, were done fast.  That's something that warrants an OK to get loot hold.  
---
Now, arguably the other stuff like "tank gets dibs on first orb" is debatable, because then what?  Healer gets second?  DPS get to /roll for the remainder?  I just remember with vanilla, finding tanks WAS A BITCH and finding healers was almost as bad.  So I can see that the tank/healer are providing a service to people in the group.
---
Granted, all that goes away if tanks are a dime a dozen and not everyone wants to play DPS.
---
Some guys were saying that in classic, you're going to see more people who are rolling classes knowing things like priest/paladin/druid are healers and not DPS (druid tanks in niche rolls) and stuff like that.  However, with live service and people not knowing what classic was all about, guarantee you that people will be rolling ret paladins, shadow priests, feral druids for raids either as meme builds or just simply not knowing.
---
Hell yeah dude
---
If you plan on raiding past BWL its basically a requirement that at least 20 people have engi in most hardcore + guilds. Also... its absolutely op in pvp and world pvp.
---
False. You absolutely can talk about whatever you want in all channels. Blizzard no longer enforces any RP rules but the naming one.
---
Ok you keep thinking that. 
---
Pservers were FAR easier than Vanilla. Tanks tanking Naxx and AQ 40 as dual weilding Fury Warriors are all the proof you need of that.
---
Skarm Tank has several breakdowns about the difference between the two versions as a Tank and he's tanked all of Naxx on farm as a MT Druid and MT Warrior.
---
I trust his detailed explanations with sourced statistics over your anecdotal evidence.
---
As for your Warrior Alt. Congrats. You were carried by a good healer and decent DPS. You managed to keep aggro because your threat gen was better than Prot. Don't break and arm jerking yourself off.
---
Haha fear slower haha
---
I remember enemies going off like rockets once youve feared them.
---
If anything then its gotten slower. If i had to guess feared players would run atleast 200% faster than normal speed
---
That’s a great strategy, however it banks on “easy” content as you mentioned. Raiding the night before reset doesn’t allow you to try again if you’re wiping. I would assume you’d progress much slower than other guilds and experience increased pressure to perform since you only have one shot / night to get it right.
---
Cata's first raid tier was fantastic, it might be one of the best opening raid tiers of any xpac (although if it counts as an opening raid tier, drunk karazhan will always hold a special place in my heart).
---
Holy moly, so basically a gruesomely long quest chain that rewards you the class set piece by piece? Sounds like something fun to work on in the early stages
---
No you can't. You absolutely have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I don't know, it's just my guess from the way questie/quest helper work where they get confused about what quests are available/completed if you disable them for a bit, or put them on a character after you've already been levelling.
---
I'm actually kind of fond of gnomes since my first dnd character was one.
---
About the dwarf warrior, one of my friends is hell-bent on making one, and another is making a pally. I don't really want to compete for gear with both of them. Anyway, a mage is my second choice after warrior - completely different I know lol
---
&gt;Edit: damn, after looking these were added after 1.12.
---
What
---
Sorry Dwight, you're wrong.
---
You have literally no other reasonable option to spend your rage on (After one rend and only if most of the ticks will land) if you're fighting a single mob. If you're fighting multiple mobs you should be spamming cleave
---
Lock is one of the most viable classes in the game
---
You still need invites though.
---
Yeah they were even called gay before wow released.
---
There are things that i wont miss
---
Pandas and outlands.
---
Especially outlands..
---
Going to play what I enjoy, and prioritize solely based on that. Don't care what others say, don't care what forums say. It's my money and my time, I'll play what I want. Every class has faults and negatives, every class has positives. Play for fun, not for a spreadsheet.
---
Then find me the Roleplaying policy page. Because you can't.
---
My friends and I create characters on Retail RP realms all the time and run into SW arguing about Ford vs Toyota. Not a single warning, ever. Just a lot of angry losers.
---
Enhancement shamam is there for nightfall axe, improved Grace of Air 88 Agility + WF.    You could move one of the hunters to the MT group too, if needed.   
---
Gotta maximize threat on horde.   Not handed to you like on the alliance.
---
Hopefully not.
---
If Classic + were to exist, I want them to implement TBC class/spec balancing. So many specs became viable at endgame, and existing specs became more refined.
---
A rule is a rule. Its okay to be wrong. Learn humility friend.
---
I know people are blah blah private server blah blah. But as a recent base to judge from. Their great. And only really suffer from agro issues. And u pretty much just spam shadowbolt. But besides that their dope af
---
Look into the races/classes for what you like. You could even pick a couple and level them to 20 to get a feeling for each one’s play style. As far as planning, there’s a good video for general leveling advice and general strategies for saving money. You’ll want a mount when you reach lvl 40! Lastly, stay social. This is not a single player game. You will go further and stay longer if you’re connected to the community.
---
À+ for such a great redesign.
---
Only noobs use keyboards, real pros kclick to move.
---
What about anglos in Quebec?
---
well since classic is based on vanilla and they imported all the vanilla data from 1.12, where the heck did the retail data come from?
---
since that was wrong, anything could be
---
If you're going to bother with Nightfall, you might as well put it on a Hunter. They have much better uptime than a Shaman. But it's really not worth it.
---
Classic costs 15 a month, put it that way and that's that.  If a McFatty # 2  comes with a Large fry and a Large Coke and it costs 5 bucks, you can't just say I didn't eat the grease sticks only the McFatty so it should be less. 
---
BFA comes with classic in a way
---
Look at something far away, extend your arms placing your hands together and make a triangle opening with your thumbs and index finger, frame out the object you are looking at and bring the "triangle" you made towards your eyes, whichever eye you come back to without losing the object is your dominant eye. Hope that makes sense.
---
Yes, the raid boss parry chance was much lower on Pservers, but we're not talking about raids, we're talking about dungeons.
---
r/sonofashepherd
---
Legit questions although it may be a bit stupid.   
---
Do you think  due to the increased scale of Classic vs Private and the fact people are getting extremely prepared for vanilla with gold making guides etc raking up tens of thousands of views, that this will impact the effectiveness of some of the tried and tested gold making strategies.   
---
Things that this prep and extra knowledge could impact it that I am thinking:
---
Over farming of areas  
---
(linked) over saturation of previously low  farmed items /reagents which gave them its value.   
---
Increased knowledge of items/farming with users becoming more self sufficient ie. "i will; just farm the mats myself" 
---
I havent really thought about it that much and equally nothing could change because people are ultimately lazy but as I see more and more stuff like this it popped into my head.
---
I would never ask a hunter to stand in melee and spam rank 1 wing clip.  I don't care how much dps it adds.
---
Just make sure you have a shard to summon me
---
No, Classic will not have a separate EULA than Retail.
---
They're specifically putting in non-Vanilla features to limit the need for GMs in Classic. They are not going to bother implementing an RP policy that's been gone from the game for 7 years.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
HOLY FUCK, IT EXISTS?!
---
I feel like that's not realistic in a lot of scenarios as warriors have quite a bit of downtime, even after fighting single mobs. It would be hard to frequently bank rage fighting one mob then immediately go pull two more mobs to spend the rage (before it decays) and not run out of hp.
---
I myself run a duo warrior/priest so I'm fighting 2-3 mobs constantly and spamming cleave for the most part, but even in that situation I find even then that it's occasionally better to HS down a single mob in some areas with sparse density vs running between mobs and just losing rage to decay.
---
Right, but the point is that those are 1.12 addons, right? Classic should be able to ask the server questions about the sorts of things you've done that live can, which I think should include the sorts of things the achievements and statistics panes show, even if there aren't actually any achievements and statistics panes. I would think this would be true unless the question makes no sense (like asking "How many Twin Peaks victories do I have?").
---
Good, then do some math. The DPS of Nightfall+Enhance is worse than just bringing another top tier DPS class, even if your raid is as caster heavy as yours.
---
As a paladin who was continuously feared in PvP, I can confirm: 
---
If I got feared, it would take me longer to run back to the warlock than it took me to flee via fear away from them. Even if they stood still.
---
What if he is on the other faction ...
---
Or no sharding/layering?
---
Even with those great examples you give, most dont understand the impact of an economy that inhabits more than 3 times the amount of players wow did back then.
---
The beginning was also a kind of stress test to see if youve got the patience. If you didnt youd change server or dont play at all and since you wont even get further than lvl 30 with that mindset, did it not matter.
---
You all can discuss about it as much as you want theres only one reason they use it and thats called money.
---
Those pros they found and present you are just a way to get it through.
---
Anyway get ready to not have a true classic experience thanks to such a massive inflation that you can waste money and still have more than enough with lvl 40 for mounts.
---
This is basically what I remember as well. I know at some point they buffed it, but I couldn't say when or how much.
---
Good question you would have to look at how to tweak it but if they go with the 1k cost for it that is 20 max cost repairs. By the time people pay for that most likely after epic mount for most people will have already respec'd a bit so you wouldn't have to increase much. Really you would have to look at on average how many times did people respec throughout classic I doubt it was as much for the average player as people are making it out to be.
---
Mages are not the most OP class in the game.
---
I have tons of keybinds with shift. It doesnt work the way you are describing at all. You should check things out before claiming it works one way when it doesn't work that way at all. If i strafe by pressing A and then use shift + R i don't start turning since the A button is already pressed down. To turn id have to lift my finger up and then press shift + A. So it works fine. I have shift + q, e, r, g, f, t, 1, 2, 3, 4 bound on my most used spells and ive never started to accidentally turn instead of strafing.
---
Classic maybe different but all I've played is Warriors from Vanilla to BFA. 
---
I did one for Ally and one for Horde in Vanilla and tanked up to AQ40. It's been over a decade and I've not bothered with Pservers or PVE beyond WOTLK as I had to focus on my career so I'm just paying catchup now.
---
But from what I hear from some of the best Tanks in WoWs streams, podcasts and content videos including my own memory. You aren't dinging 60 and running LBRS, UBRS, Scholo and Strat as Fury with other fresh 60s.
---
Maybe in classic you will be able to, maybe classic is easier. But in Vanilla if you wanted to tank most people respected to Prot before they even hit 60 usually in the last few levels while they were tackling BRD.
---
Gotchu
---
It s different due to the widescreen support in the modern client, classic client was built for 4:3 and preserved horizontal fov regardless of aspect ratio, at a certain point it just made more sense to let the horizontal fov increase with wider aspect ratios and preserve vertical fov.
---
Nothing, because you weren't being honest :)
---
Trolls just got so much more style then everyone else
---
Cheers for that, makes me happy!
---
Hell yeh
---
Show me on the doll where the scuffed private server rep values touched you.
---
Imagine i was the one fearing you and now we found us somehow decades later on reddit.
---
But yeah it was always fun to see these lads going off and as soon as they came back you feared again and again.
---
Sometimes i didnt even dot i just feared for aslong as possible.
---
hahahaha this fucking weirdo starring directly into the god damn camera the whole time
---
Luckily my commute to work is basically non existent, so once the kids go to bed I get like a solid 3 hours. I basically can wake up and be at work within 10 mins.
---
[This orc begs to differ.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Brewmaster_Drohn)
---
Can we get a GoT reenactment?
---
Odd - I remember mapping my binds out (albeit this was TBC) and it was definitely an issue then!
---
Still, if you’re pressing a shift+1 keybind for example and begin to strafe, it’ll keyboard turn instead unless there’s absolutely no overlap in key presses.
---
Yea man trust me you can’t go wrong with warlocks if you can get past shard farming. Free mounts, desired for groups for summons, easy gold farming capabilities, easy leveling, and great damage are just a few reasons I’m going lock
---
99% of raids want warm bodies and won't care what you play
---
Mages are broken
---
Are we looking at the same photos? I only see 2-4 hunters in the raid depending on the fight. One of the hunters is barely above the tanks on the KT kill.
---
Don’t waste your breath fam. Some people don’t want to look into things and would rather just tell people how things WILL BE. The crushing blow bit about “raid level” went straight over his head.
---
Cool story.
---
Apperently I'm not a modern gamer because I don't use a 3rd party application. It can't be that big of a deal considering I never heard about it until recently. 
---
Ive still been playing SC, LoL, DoTA, BF, WoW PvP, Civ and FF14 and never stumbled upon Discord yet.
---
I only use Ventrilo because a group of RL friends and old guildies still hangout in it.
---
If I'm still gaming right now, I'm a modern gamer. Quite trying to make yourself feel superior because you know of something useful someone else doesn't. It's pathetic.
---
Hey man it’s not going to be 100% like vanilla so just don’t worry about it or if ur gonna flip ur shit over nothing then maybe go outside or something? It’s irrational to be this emotional over a game
---
I did level one around BC but only to like 35 I really enjoyed the fuck out it that's why I want to go Lock.  Thanks for the tips, makes me pumped
---
#nochanges
---
Yeah, that kinda creeped me out, but I was looking at the gnome most of the time which angered me so I didn't notice it that much.
---
Something like [this](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=23064) maybe.
---
I’ll be one of the only ones!
---
SoR never triggered JoL/JoW.  That was a systems bug from 3.x+ where JoW/JoL proc mechanic was changed to any spell.
---
If SoR could double proc JoW, then people would have considered using SoR+JoW to restore mana, but the solution was always SoW+JoW.
---
Judgment double procs is probably a bug, also probably related to the newer JoW/JoL mechanics.
---
SoL SP Scaling: Did you account for level based scaling too?
---
Procs are all based on a spell type mask.   Judgment is a "Ranged Spell with Damage Type Holy", they then trigger a script based on what seal was up.  This is why the double procs can happen, even though the 'holy spell' is just a dummy spell for targeting.
---
In this case, double procs might be vanilla.
---
Oh I can see that happening to a fair few people not familiar with the Halberd.
---
It was simply a weapon that so many people were unfamiliar with even though it probably dropped far more frequently than Jin'rohk.  Players in the Vanilla era were more focused on weapons that provided stats over procs.
---
You might not be able to tank UBRS as Fury the day you ding 60, but you will be able to tank every 5-man as Fury. And then you'll get gear that lets you tank UBRS as Fury.
---
You don't spec prot unless you're going into raids as prot. You cannot at all be crushed in dungeons and crits that wipe you on a raid boss aren't that much of a problem in a dungeon.
---
No you wont. You press a first and start strafing, pressing shift after doesnt magically reverse time to make it shift+a.
---
Biggest problem that many aren't used to is no mob sharing. So hunters and any instant casters will be tagging everything first. A fresh supply of hunters every few seconds means this pattern never stops.
---
Jesus christ you're wrong yet you still bother to reply how sad. A rule is a rule regardless. And its a rule. blocked
---
If you have shift and 1 held down (ie you’re executing a shift+1 bind) and you attempt to start strafing, you WILL turn instead.
---
You won't have any leftover quests.
---
That’s a shit ton of content. I really hope they do add more content after Naxx if they are able to maintain the classic feel and level 60 cap. I like tbc, but I LOVE classic, and I’d rather continue to play classic with new and exciting content then go through BC again. I really really hope this can happen.
---
Then link me the rule.
---
What's TFT?
---
If you stack spellpower your aimed shot, multi shot and auto shots will hit like wet noodles. Also you cant SS in raids so its all for 1 spell with really low base damage, look at shaman shocks and their base spell damage, CD and the fact they can be used from range.
---
Please make more of these, thanks.
---
Yeah I would like a quest addon for Quest completion...Id really like to do all available Horde quests for once.

Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne
---
Thats not the order you said it in. Besides this made up scenario doesnt exist. If you hold down shift + 1, how are you going to even hit the A key?
---
They’re using 8.3.5 engine so it would make sense that some things would remain. “Artifacts” if you will. Like how hunters can tame things 2 levels higher than them. That’s not how it was in vanilla but it’s something that doesn’t translate cause of the data not specifying it.
---
Gorgeous!
---
&gt;I like how this goes to show that you can clear naxx with other dps than only fury warrs, mages and a hunter.
---
I only see Warriors, mages, rogues, warlocks, and hunters on that DPS list which is a standard vanilla raid comp. Am I missing something here?
---
&gt;Also no need to stack every single (world) buff available in the game. All these things make it easier, yes, but still much doable without.
---
They did for Loatheb which my guild did as well in Vanilla, it was one of the only fights we had to grab world buffs for.
---
Upvoted for upvoting the upvote.
---
Here here.  Best RP community around.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
.
---
The cake is a lie.
---
Yes I did, re-read my last couple of comments. 
---
Is this a joke? It doesn’t have to be 1, it could be anything. It could be Shift+Mouse Button 4 and suddenly you’re unable to start strafing. 
---
For any class I’ve played this would be hugely problematic. Strafing while applying dots as a warlock would end up with you doing circles if any of your spells were bound with a shift modifier.
---
You are correct. I've crunched the numbers myself -- crit is always better than hit for warlocks.   
---
(It's also worth noting, hit past 4% does nothing in PVP, which makes crit an even clearer choice for PVP-minded players.)
---
Where did I call UBRS a 5 man. I just called it a dungeon, when was the last time someone classified it as a Raid?
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but all I've said is from my own anecdotal evidence and the past few months of reading/watching the top tanks content out there.
---
Maybe I was bad, but I still managed to get Thunderfury, I still managed to see the fee few bosses of Naxx before TBC launched.
---
WoW and gaming wasn't my priority in life like it seems to be in yours as passionate as you are about it and claiming I'm not a "modern gamer" because I didn't know what Discord was, as if that's some sort of superior title to hold.
---
Relax man, you're derailing the entire topic and trying to feel superior by latching onto things I say instead of addressing the main point.
---
You claimed any Warrior will be tanking in any spec. I disagree wholeheartedly.
---
I'm not saying an expert like you can't manage to do it, but ANY Warrior won't. You're underestimating the amount of casuals and DPS driven Warriors there will be who suck tits at tanking.
---
Let's stay in topic here, the only point I'm interested in arguing with you is your claim that any Warrior will be tanking 60 dungeons (and UBRS) as any spec.
---
They won't, most of the Warriors will need to be Prot to do it effectively or at all as a fresh 60.
---
Someone calling the house phone!
---
Theres only 11-12 casters.   The shadow priest heals when necessary, while keeping mind flay up.  I got 2 extra locks, and spriest.   You have 2 extra hunters, and a holy priest.
---
I have done the math.  If the Enhance shaman is in the group with 4 dps, and the OT isn't using Nightfall, then he is at the top of the meters.  If the OT is using Nightfall, then he is middle of the pack.  Like 75% of the rogue.  That is still respectable.  
---
Let's say the casters are doing 1,000 dps to make things easy.  Just using the 11 casters.  33% uptime ~ +5% magic damage.  11*5 = 55% = 550 dps just from Nightfall.  Improve GoA is 88 agility, which is roughly 3-4% dmg increase for the 4 melee.  Let's just say that they're at 1000 dps too.  3% * 4000 = 120 dps.  Improved WF totem is probably only like 20 dps per melee, so +80.   That's 750 dps just with the buffs that he provides.  Your personal DPS will be crap, but I suspect it will be at least 250 dps.   Add all that up, and the Shaman is right there at the top with the others.  
---
Besides, he adds avoidance, and threat to the MT group when needed.  IMO that is seriously worth considering.   If players can't dps, because they are threat capped, then that Enhancement shaman's dps contribution grows substantially.
---
I havent played since 07' and i swear this comment brought back forgotten memories. The way you just stereotyped all of those classes was spot on.
---
&gt; On Pservers maybe. Without BiS you aren't tanking UBRS on Vanilla as Fury with 4 casuals in tow.
---
You did it right there. https://redd.it/c6duig
---
I agree but I think it's nice to have a choice in the matter.  Not that I would choose one item per letter over twelve, but the degradation of the current game can be traced to a ton of incremental changes amounting to a bona-fide shitshow.
---
I think the idea is that no one trusts Blizzard to use discretion in which changes are good and which arent.
---
Whatever (to me) though.  I'm just bored of hearing myself type.
---
It didn't at all. Prot is required in raids because bosses are LVL 63 and you want to avoid crushing blows. It's less useful for offtanks as they aren't usually tanking LVL 63 mobs.
---
My entire argument is about this dudes claim that ANY Warrior will be able to tank 60 dungeons in ANY spec.
---
As a fresh 60 this just isn't true. There will be plenty of Warriors that don't really care for tanking but want to gear up and inexperienced casuals that will need to be Prot to handle tanking those on a fresh 60.
---
This can give a weapon AOE: https://classicdb.ch/?item=5421
---
You'll find a lot of people who are bad at math saying things like "missed hits can't crit."  
---
These people are bad at math, and have a grossly oversimplified idea of how to approach the problem.
---
Yep.  I was there for server first MC, BWL, AQ40.  Was the best of times
---
How did it shake out for each faction since horde had shaman totems and alliance had paly buffs?
---
"Everyone pick the 6th realm on the list unless it's not the type of pvp/pve that we agreed on, otherwise go to the next one on the list"
---
Oh, its ServerMcServer, well okay then...
---
It looks like they dropped hunters because there was only 5 hunters for the starting fights. Sapphiron only has 3 hunter. KT only has 2 hunters. Four Horsemen only has 2 hunters. Loatheb only has 2 hunters. Gluth has 5 for the traps.
---
The worgen in duskwood ate my ass in the worst way when I was 14
---
&gt;Is there any class that comes close to mages in all aspects of gameplay/ quality of life
---
No, but playing the strongest class is boring in it's own way.
---
Truly.  My dream is to have Old Blanchy's Feed Pouch (shit) tier items in each slot with outrageously expensive enchants on all of them.
---
You're probably right, if it has modern api support it might be all baked in and you don't need to worry.
---
have you ever looked at sunwell progression? Paladins stood at the entrance of the instance to buff the raid, but did not be oart of it. Twink warlocks put soulstones on every member. Shaman stacking to the max. 
---
Min maxing was very much a thing.  But mainly for hardcore progression raids. 
---
And overall the racials are more often than not inconsequential in pve anyway.
---
Kill KT he broke our guild back in vanilla so wanna kill him this time around :)
---
I misread a sentence where you said "a" and thought you meant pressing a. 
---
Alright, doesnt matter what button it is. You dont press shift down long enough for it to ever be a problem. I only hold down shift when i press the spell im using. And i do that while strafing all the time. Do you stop moving to press spells? If so then yeah maybe it would impact you. But then you have a bigger problem.
---
playing NE rogue just for the front flip idgaf
---
If I had to pick the "best" class in vanilla it'd be mage.  2nd best maybe warrior.  Mages are insane in vanilla and pretty much the only downside is the fact that there are lots of other mages because they are so good.
---
Im going orc warlock but for pvp reasons.
---
The battles for World Dragons were insanity on vanilla Emerald Dream.  Let’s recapture the magic, &lt;Vindictive&gt;!
---
1. Resto shaman can pick up imp totems without needing to pretend to DPS.
---
2. You didn't presume that, but you put your only improved totem guy in with the tank group, so he's not giving melee any improved DPS.
---
3. 33% uptime is very lofty for an enhancement shaman, most guilds put it at a 4% spell damage buff, not 5.
---
So 250 + 440 = 690. Yep, you're better off bringing another anything else.
---
I think it's safe to say that what most people complained about is all the instant-gratification and all the loss of community. The biggest complaints I've seen are about 2 things: making the world "smaller" i.e. the Dungeon Finder &amp; flying mounts, and homogenization of the classes. 
---
If they can stay true to the philosophy of classic (which, who knows if they can) then I think a "Classic+" would be a great thing.
---
Phase 2 is coming pretty quick. Don’t be surprised if it’s November.
---
I’m genuinely surprised this isn’t impacting you. Playing a priest, or any healer, in arena with any instant cast spells on a shift modifier would make strafing problematic.
---
Vanilla was still $15 a month way back then. Adjusting for inflation, it should be $20-25 a month now so think of it as a steal.
---
What method are you using to get to the front of the instance again after you kill princess? Keep in mind /camp will not work in Classic like it does on Pservers, severely reducing your gold per/hour
---
From a developer point of view - some things are "hard-coded", we don't expect them to ever change, whereas other things are "dynamic", populated from data in a database. The challenge of building Classic to mesh with Retail server / db structure is that most things in Retail are dynamic and most things in Classic were hard-coded. 
---
Most of classic is built by filling in the gaps where something dynamic is expected in the Retail structure using whatever was hard-coded within the code in Classic. But the normalization values are potentially hard-coded into Retail itself, so the Classic team didn't know it was an issue in the first place because it wasn't observed to be broken.
---
I would be very surprised if there wasn't at least one other instance of something wrong like this scenario. That said, issues like this are not a guess of "guesswork" like as suggested in the meme but more that some things that are coded into the retail engine and being assumed to be working if they appear to be working in classic but not EXACTLY like how they were in classic.
---
Crushing Blows and bring Crit isn't what your concerned about in Dungeons.
---
It goes beyond just those things. It's basic midigation and long drawn out trash pulls/adds that take a toll on a single healer. You spec Prot so the group runs smoother as fresh 60 healers aren't as well geared either. 
---
It's about specific Prot to BE a better tank for your entire group, not just because you could manage to do it as Fury.
---
Like I mentioned before. Vast majority of Warriors won't tank, and the minority that do bother do only have a small sub group that are actually good at it.
---
F

Sir Saltie, I’m not kidding when I say this: this comic is the funniest thing I’ve seen all week. You did a great job! Please make more :)
---
In high school I made $10 an hour baking bagels. Now I've gone to college, gotten several degrees, worked a ton, started my own business, and now just work a few hours a week.
---
So yep, I'm gonna buy a shit ton of gold.
---
I'm gonna main a warrior. Preferably arms at 60 for pvp and dungeon tanking. Will I ever hit rank 14 or get full tier set? Almost definitely not. Will I get trashed by people with end game gear? Yes, most likely. But that's fine, I'll get some friends together anyway and we'll run some dungeons and some BGs, and they won't care that as dps I went dwarf for my mighty beard rather than the human weapon skill bonus. We'll just have fun.

And my alt will be a paladin, so my leveling experience will be double slow and boring. But paladins were cool as fuck, and I want to try my hand at healing dungeons and pvp. So what if I can't kill shit on him and only have 2 healing spells not counting downranking, we'll stomp some dicks here and there. I don't have to win all the time to have fun, I don't need to top the meters for a class to be worth if, I just enjoy the gameplay with some friends. It's what I miss in retail.
---
Ok lad read my comment. Just do it so youll get the correct view on locks.
---
Locks arent the dps masters, they focus on qol supports.
---
Those guys complaining its just shadowbolt in raids, yeah theyre right.
---
But
---
Raiding doesnt begin just when you enter the raid.
---
It begins with preparation.
---
There are classes that have to do more preps but wont do as much in the raid itself. Locks are the perfect example.
---
We farm soul shards.
---
Thats what were made for.
---
Soulstones, hearthstones and summons.
---
And while farming those you can use other things as shadowbolt dont worry.. 
---
Its up to you what kind of game experience you will have. This is one of many.
---
You are the one having to travel to every dungeon to summon your teammates. Yes
---
I like the travel tbh. Its a peace a little chatting a little seeing the world. And the thing with summoning, do you know the feeling of being the first one at work? Well its similar. 
---
You want to be the one taking his time and try to make others life easier? Roll lock
---
You want to be no.1 On dmg meters?
---
Dont roll lock, roll mage
---
Dont think too much about it just look at it like me, no numbers nothing just gameplay difference.
---
Because if you try to optimize everything up to those small things youll end up not getting anything you truly want and a gaming with something that isnt for you but is "best" is definitely the worst.
---
To your question about professions. Its wow, do what you like.
---
Id say tailoring/alchemy and its second job.
---
Either for the shadow weave set (is it correct name? Np man) or just simply for the money of herbalism and the free buffs you lack.
---
I mean a smithing lock isnt ordinary but hey if there are non binary genders in rl you can go smithing in wow.
---
I want to do every quest in each zone level in and really soak up the lore. Also, I'm going hard core on professions this time. I'm going going to do a single raid until my profession skills are maxed!
---
I want to focus on my main more this go around. In Vanilla and BC my focus was on 19 twinks and I didn't even hit max level until probably 2009 or late 2008.
---
You know what's amazing?  Thrashing an undead rogue despite their WotF advantage with superior play.  
---
These front runner bitch boys and girls will never experience the intense satisfaction of outplaying the shit out of players with a clear "on-paper" advantage.
---
Leave the min-maxing to the scrubs and you'll find yourself having so much more fun by being better at your class than they can ever dream of being.
---
&gt; Vanilla is (in)famous for the need to chug protection potions, whipper root tubers, sagefish, and all other manner of consumables. Flasking for everything is the culture on retail, full consumable usage was the culture in vanilla back in the day and presently on private servers. 
---
I raided all the way up to Naxx (4/19) in Vanilla and the vast majority of the raid never used anything other than protection potions to make up the required amount of resists if you lacked resist gear during progression, otherwise they came from the guild bank. Maybe the odd Firewater etc, but it was rare. We never used flasks until Naxx, and that was only because the guild bank was rich and stockpiled enough by that point to buy them for everyone, and TBC was coming.  
---
I was doing more grinding for Legion mythic raiding than I ever did for Vanilla raiding because that's what the guild bank was for back then. The guild bank would even cover people's enchants and shit using disenchanted epics and donated greens.  
---
Grinding for 10 hours per hour of raiding is a private server thing. People also looked down on you if you used consumables for most PvP since it was seen as a crutch; "I have no skill and/or shit gear so I have to compensate by wasting gold instead". Not saying whether this is better or worse, just pointing out what it was like back then. I kinda like that private server PvP has differentiated itself and evolved the meta.
---
Most of those turtles were actually Naga.
---
Except it's part of phase 5. It was added as catch up gear when AQ released.
---
You can't use it in combat.
---
So true.  Didnt see this before I posted my similar rant, but the adversity is so sweet to overcome.
---
Ok that was kinda freaky when i tried it out
---
Apologies. You got me. I guess since you found a mistake in what I said that isn't even related to the original point that means you can completely avoid actually responding on the bullshit claim I called you out on.
---
Keep going, attack my grammar and spelling next some more. Maybe some Ad Hominem to sprinkle on-top (oh you already did that).
---
How about a retort to your BS claim that ANY Warrior is going to be tanking their BiS farms as Fury or Arms. 
---
You're the one who thinks Tanks are going to be done a dozen just because Warriors are the top played class. Have you played any MMO in the past 20 years? Because from that claim it just shows nothing but ignorance.
---
The situation with the EU servers has seriously curbed my enthusiasm.
---
Get naked and drown yourself.
---
What a creepy fucking dude, do his eyes not blink?
---
Good players &gt; good stats
---
Plankadin
---
Roll on a pvp server
---
I had the same experience as you back in the day.  Pick Pocket is a meme.
---
Yeah it stays the same amount all the way up.  They get more strength and hp though.
---
Then you should try it yourself and you'll see you never have it happen either. You dont cast a spell and press down strafe at the exact same time, ever. At least i don't. I always start moving first or after.
---
As my good friend /u/erat said, I'm [not wasting my breath](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6duig/solo_warriors_how_will_you_farm_gold_at_60/es88xg6/) on you anymore.
---
Good luck with your Ventrilo grandpa.
---
As a shadow priest, I don't think i could kill landslide.. Maybe didn't bring the right consume.
---
Alliance warlock.
---
I was pretty scared of the gap in WC.
---
Battleground titles. Never got one i was proud enough of. Gods i miss the grind
---
This
---
If you’re not in combat it does. A good example is when a mage frost novas you and then starts to fast a spell, if you leave combat momentarily between the nova and the next spell hitting you than you can meld to stop the cast
---
Really? Nagas used turtles with little huts on them to travel above water?
---
I thought DM was Phase 3 my mistake.
---
I hope we see Phase 2 by winter holidays but it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't come out until afterwards. 
---
Being a casual at this point in my life I wouldn't mind it. I can enjoy Phase 1 for 3 months.
---
Can’t go wrong as a shaman when you’re buddies are rogue and warrior. Your groups dps will be lit fam.
---
Lmao bro chill
---
But you can eat/drink with it (can't in Retail). That's something... &gt;.&lt;
---
I farmed Princess a ton on my shadow priest back in the day but never saw that blade drop. I'm thinking of trying for it again - cuz hey, even if it doesn't drop, it's good gold in one of my favorite instances.
---
Did you get the Blade to drop? And how did you like it? I'm rolling a troll and I think that if it procs from Shadowguard, it could end up being BiS for a long time.
---
Omg, if I get banned for this post, I'm blaming you. You know exactly what I meant.
---
Nothing to buy. Just need a sub. Also day one what about day3? Where the starting zones are still filled with people. You do know at its peak they had over 12 million subs right?
---
They farm her for gold. This is fun, next question!
---
All on sale on the Steam sale as well!
---
I’ll just leave this here. Crystal Water and You!
---
https://youtu.be/cXp_jFvlfMA
---
Man it’s been a long time, forgot about that. Appreciate the info.
---
You’re clearly not stutter-step casting in arena to juke interrupts. 🤣
---
Either away, this configuration is restrictive - an Alt+A/D configuration would probably be better for most.
---
If you eat/drink then shadowmeld it works, at least on the private server I just tested it on.

---
Exactly, and a major problem in vanilla was that many people were new to MMOs in general, let alone raiding. I meant "easier" as in obtaining certain gear,  less talents, worrying about hit chance, resistances, class reagents, and player vs mob power. 
---
I also meant that doing a Mythic raid is the top tier raiding compared to Vanilla's normal raids, but a lot of people around here act like LFR is easy so heroic and mythic must be a joke too, when in reality it's just a bigger dungeon with better loot. 
---
Im excited for classic because of its complex simplicity like runescape, but I don't think it's going to be the challenge people remember. It's going to be hard to raid, sure, but its not going to touch a candle to mythics.
---
Yeah, that's how it works in Beta too. That little bonus wasn't removed until WotLK.
---
Get lock to 30, the class really starts to shine after you get better ranks of Corruption / CoA and when you're 21 deep into a talent tree.

Blizzard confirmation of two-roll system for resolving spells: [+Spell Hit Chance - 10/5/2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208221922/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=10271182)
---
&gt;Eyonix decides to fire a fireball at Yeti of Doom. Eyonix still has +6% spell hit. Fireball is not a binary spell. Heres the calculation: 
---
&gt;0.83+0.06= 0.89 
---
&gt;The game will roll a number between 0 and 1, and if its less than 0.89, the fireball will hit. Otherwise, a resist message will appear. After the fireball lands, the game will then apply spell resistance to determine a partial resist, if any. Assuming the yeti also has 50% fire resistance, on average, 50% of the damage will be resisted.
---
 - Eyonix, Blizzard CM

Further explanation from WoWWiki:[The effect of Hit chance on Critical Hit chance](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_hit#The_effect_of_Hit_chance_on_Critical_Hit_chance)
---
&gt;Unlike the melee combat system, spell crit makes absolutely no difference to hit chance. All spells, regardless of whether they are treated as binary or not, roll hit and crit separately. Conceptually, the game rolls for your hit chance first, and if the spell hits you have a separate roll for whether it crits.
---
&gt;Overall chance to crit over all spells cast is thus affected by hit rate. To calculate overall crit rate, multiplying the two chances together:
---
&gt;    crit rate over all spell casts = crit * hit
---
&gt;For example, a caster with no spell hit rating gear or talents, against a mob 3 levels higher (83% hit chance), and 30% crit rating from gear and talents:
---
&gt;    crit rate over all spell casts = 30% * 83% = 24.9%
---
&gt;In addition, direct damage spells suffer from partial resistance, but again, that has no effect on whether a spell hits or not.
---
lmfao i totally thought you were serious
---
 I rolled an orc hunter on the ND private server leveled and twinked to 29. When facing night elf hunters they were able to drop my target and cancel attacks by using shadowmeld giving them a substantial advantage. I was informed that this is an example of private servers being inauthentic and that it never worked that way in the real game.
---
That's what Layering is for. They can be so aggressive with Layering that there's only a handful of people in your version of the starting zone.
---
It's not.
---
Dwarf&gt; Nightelf. You can Stoneform blind, which is like a direct counter to one of your hardest classes to kill
---
I think Rolf would be a night elf because he is so tall
---
Interesting, I wonder if it would be worth it tho to stop all dps to cancel out a frostbolt. I mean, it uses up their mana and that’s crucial in vanilla and it would give you an opening to set a big aimed shot and such, so maybe.
---
Quality upvote and chuckle from me as I work in new construction. If I wasnt on that new to the trades budget id throw gold at you so take my ghetto gold please🏅
---
GMs
---
Ya so just nit pick what you bother to respond to (which east a waste of breath considering I had to clarify multiple times my UBRS blunder).
---
While completely avoiding the BS claims you made that you were called out on.
---
I'll just take this W smiling considering you waste your time with Ad Hominem but couldn't even bother to explain how you think tanks will be dime a dozen magically in Classic and go against the entire MMO history across pretty much all games.
---
Again, how the hell is 30 years old a grandpa? I  spent my 20s avoiding gaming and developing my career so I can enjoy my 30s playing games with my son on an expensive computer and driving my boat at the cottage. Sorry I didn't spend my days as a promoter for Discord ragging on people for not being as modern of a gamer as you are.
---
Usually when you are nova’d the mage is in your dead zone so you can’t dps anyway
---
I never saw it back in vanilla. See it pretty frequently on p servers now. I don't like how prevalent it's become. Doesn't anyone just group anymore?
---
I don't see the Shadowlands or Crestfall.
---
The Lost Isles wasn't classic.
---
Suramar was underwater.
---
The Dragon Isles existed as much as GM Island did.
---
Skinning &amp; Engineering 
---
Skinning bc it's the only profession that levels with you (you don't have to grind lower level zones) and it generates a decent amount of cash.
---
Use that cash &amp; your innate ability to farm shit easily to fund Engineering!
---
I mean it’s how we met, might as well relive our youth.
---
People spend $60 a week to have blue apron shipped to them. You're complaining about spending $15 a month (50 cents a day) for unlimited access to the best version of our favorite mmo, I spend 50 cents a day rounding my total up at Wendy's you cheap bastard.
---
That's the thing about classic. There's maybe 3-6 damage abilities that you alternate between for most classes, but then you have between... fifteen to twenty additional abilities, plus items and consumables and suddenly you're rapidly approaching fourty plus keybinds.
---
Don't demand it, ask. It's more about how you approach the situation.
---
Flint Locke vs the Horde is the closets thing I can think of that's similar.
---
I dont play arena at all. I added this keybind for the few times i play one handed while on the phone and in need of turning while autowalking. And ive never had a single time of me randomly turning. 
---
But i can still stutterstep. Since i never hold down shift. I always press it down at the same time as i use a shift bound spell. I never pre hold down shift. I find that uncomfortable
---
Lordaeron - Living Dead Girl. There was a different video that I used to watch/love but unable to find it these days. Found these that are similar.

Whaaat? Outlands gave us some of the best raids and some gorgeous new zones. Zangarmarsh is my favorite place in the WoW universe.
---
There will be plenty of level 60 Fury Warriors wanting to gear up in dungeons and willing and able to do so without a single problem. You're not going to be able to charge money to tank anything.
---
No W for you.
---
You using classic wowhead for any research?
---
Says whom?
---
I'm glad it works for you. 😜
---
It's not optimal.
---
I tried to pick only a few boss drops. I didn't think that the main barrier to entry would be simply time, so thanks for the perspective.
---
I want to not level as a holy priest.
---
Focus more on PVE raiding and enjoying the game thing time around. I spent months grinding PVP ranks and eventually got R14, only to find that farming MC/ZG didn’t provide nearly the same rush as BGs and ended up quitting. 
---
This time around I’ll smell the roses a bit more.

Requires engineering but it's another one.
---
Yea, that’s an very important part I can’t get my mind off. Druid might have to be my only NE but I dunno, it’s gonna be hard to switch cuz I’ve been a NE hunter since the beginning lol. But man, Stoneform tho for those rogues, can’t be ignored.
---
&gt;necromancers review the dead.
---
Which undead is highest rated, do you think? My money is on liches.
---
I remember this.
---
Pvp, messing up in groups, pressing need on items, pvp, not knowing what to do in raids, PvP,
---
Yea, I completely forgot about not being able to use it in combat. When I was horde and I saw a NE hunter, I tried to mark them ASAP so they couldn't get the first shot
---
No, dropping your target and thus cancelling your cast is how it should be (and is in the Beta). They just can't do it unless they drop combat.
---
Hunters hardcounter rogues. Night Elf is much better.
---
Whats optimal for me is not for you to decide.
---
They certainly were stat-focused, at their peril. That proc was absolutely devastating. As you can read above, I know from experience. I can’t think of any other procs that hit as hard as Decapitate.
---
I'm not trolling, just new to Classic endgame. FWIW, AV rep was p quick, although that could've been a change in tbc/wrath, and I figure AD rep would be decently quick farming Scholo/Strat for most of the gear. The Chromatic Mantle is more of a perk than a necessity, I guess. Also, I am counting on faster players clearing MC and making available the mats for the enchant, although I actually don't know which you're talking about.
---
This is false. You've been fighting bad rogues. And good hunters don't stand ontop of their flare and trap.
---
The OP isn't interested in what's optimal for you.
---
As a Hunter you hardcounter rogues. You don’t need Stoneform. Every pro hunter out there will tell you that shadowmeld is way more useful than Stoneform.
---
You don't need raid gear to tank 5mans/ubrs as fury or arms. A decent set of 60 dungeon blues/pvp gear is fine. Honestly fury/arms dps warriors make much better tanks for that content than prot warriors do. They do way more aoe threat and at the same time contribute a ton to group dps. They may have to switch to shield/def stance for a couple of pulls or bosses depending on the instance and gear, but 90% of the time dps mode is where it's at.
---
&gt;Same thing goes for charging people for runs as a Tank.
---
If the tank has nothing to gain from the dungeon than he should be charging to do it. His time could be better spent farming or doing literally anything else.
---
Most tanks aren't going to charge for a dungeon that has quests or loot he wants to do.
---
As for loot, as long as it communicated before hand its fine. He could easily find a different group that will either let him have that item if it drops, or make one that doesn't include classes that can even Need roll on it.
---
Ya’ll realize the game hasn’t even come out and you’re asking for expansions, right?
---
RP-PvP players can type complete sentences.  If that sounds like the type of people you’d like to be around, roll RP-PVP.
---
Oh, that's super late compared to tier 2 gear right? :/
---
That’s how it works on the beta as well.
---
Oh that’s right. Gahhhh! Man, I played vanilla but I was very young so I have a lot to learn still which I’m excited for.
---
Yes, I'd love a detailed breakdown! You don't sound preachy; rather, very helpful. The wowclassicbis site was defense heavy, and I thought it would be pertinent to push crits and crushing blows as far off the table as possible. Indeed, I do hope to use Shield Block only sparingly.
---
Im definitely not the only one that would find this optimal.
---
Then dont play, pretty much as simple as that. They wont be seperating the subs, they have no reason to do so. They would miss out on a ton of revenue if they did, more so than what they would earn from any extra subs. A 66% reduction in price is a rediculous ask. But sure, spend your 70 bucks on a brand new game with 20-30 hours of gameplay.
---
There are a number of thorns effects you can get (some of these are newer vanilla)
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_shield](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_shield)
---
yeah... this is a good idea. gonna get me some o dat
---
You’ve got a very skewed understanding of the word optimal.
---
I'd be 100% for undead paladins. As long as they do not have access to any holy skills whatsoever.
---
Good times ahead :D
---
Clearly you have problems reading. I stated many times that I DONT charge people to Tank and DONT feel proper doing so.
---
There's people in both Pservers and Retail charging for tank runs to this day, even with Discord being a thing so I don't know what the echo you're hearing in your own ass is telling you.
---
Yes, there will be plenty of fresh 60 Fury Warriors willing to tank but not all of them will succeed, especially those that don't know how to tank, that don't understand threat, that don't understand their healers limitations etc. The Warriors that aren't experts at the game or confident tanking that still end up giving it the ok college try to get geared will end up spending Prot to play it safe.
---
That's not ANY Warrior in ANY spec. You've now backpeddled to SOME Warriors in FURY. Your entire argument contradicts your original bullshit claim.
---
Just take the L and stay out of my notifications. I thought you were done wasting your breath as that's all you've been doing so far.
---
How far away are we talking? 20'? 50'?
---
I want to like my character and for it to reflect my personal preferences. That's why I'm asking, will it still be able to help other people?
---
I can say the same for you
---
Ehh there won't be that many Warriors. It's the [2nd most played](https://i.imgur.com/BLaOzJG.png) on a popular private server at level 60. [Strawpoll](https://www.strawpoll.me/17557953/r) with 40k votes has Warrior barely at #1. [23k Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2el2b/here_are_some_results_of_the_survey_from_the/) has Warrior 3% above Mage.
---
It's also the class that people reroll away from as they level up so I wouldn't expect there to be 3% more Warriors than Mages at level 60.
---
Our server had an all tauren pvp group that shit stomped azeroth, I still get weary when I see more than two at one time together in the world.
---
Not entirely true, given equal skill level, rogue runs into a fair bit of issues with a few classes. Also the World of Roguecraft videos are based on a version of Vanilla that we aren't even going to play, it can't be done in 1.12.
---
Which is why there is no reason why there wouldn't be undead paladins. It doesn't make sense lore wise
---
Don’t feel weird. I made a killing being a 6.2kGS DK tank in wrath, id charge people for anything and everything.
---
You worked for your gear and character, charge people for help. If they don’t like it then that’s their problem. Just be upfront about it!
---
What do people think of a druid tank rolling on healing gear as long as you are up front about it?  That was probably how I was going to try and gear up since tanking is more needed and I'd prefer to tank over heal.  But I need heal gear to raid.
---
Kill Nefarian with a guild I help create. I raided with a guild that cleared BWL easily and got some  decent gear. Then went on to make my own guild with friends. It was mostly filled with ppl with no raiding gear. Downing Rag with that guild felt special. Sadly did not make too far in BWL. Killed Vael a couple times but soon after guild broke up.
---
I don’t disagree, but that’s what WoD was.  I was hoping it was going to go in a better direction.
---
I paid $15 just to do the stress test... damn you Blizzard!
---
Warrior is the best class in Vanilla. Mage is a close second.
---
Why play solo?
---
There's no game where the story of WoD existed except WoD.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904) 
---
and 
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=17109](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17109) 
---
They reduced mana cost of spell casts before 1.3 but the tooltips on all the websites show the nerfed affects
---
Yep. IIRC it has a 2% drop rate so my 60ish runs wasn't bad at all.
---
It's amazing for AOE with Holy Nova, since it's a 10% chance on any spell hit, and you'll get an extra cast or two out of the mana refund.
---
But even for shadow, just assuming you do nothing but Mind Flay, that's a proc every ~30s for 100 mana and 100 base shadow damage (scaled by +dmg, not sure on coefficient). So basically 16 mp5 and a pretty decent chunk of damage.
---
Yeah its a quite uncommon opinion i guess. It just didnt feel right to go to another planet for me back then. Especially with all those zones that werent able in azeroth.
---
And i loved nagrand but i honestly cant stand this sci fi theme of the burning legion.
---
I like fantasy with ships and all but not giant machines walking around.
---
And this ufo thing of the draenei.
---
Making bloodelf zone into a starting zone and such.
---
I wished they completed azeroth
---
The zandalari empire, kul tirans.. These zones should have come and not another world imo.
---
And now we got it in retail. I honestly just payed one month so i could see these 2 zones ive wanter for sll these years and i d i dnt sub since wotlk..
---
I want these with vanilla gameplay
---
Yeah you’re clueless.
---
If you send your pet in shadowmeld, it doesn’t put you in combat and take you out of stealth? Or are you just saying it’s a good way to open up on someone that doesn’t have a target yet?
---
IRL no pants, the entire time 1-60. Something that I can achieve and be proud of.
---
And yet you can't offer any counter argument lol.
---
This is one of the best checkmates I've seen.
---
This is why I prefer that we have "Classic Vanilla" servers and "Classic+" servers that do *new* expansions.  Otherwise we will have Vanilla servers, TBC servers, WotLK servers, Cata servers, MoP servers, etc.  Far better imo to have Vanilla and alternate-reality WoW that learns from the mistakes of the other expansions.
---
The AVERAGE Warrior.
---
The vast Majority of Warriors will fail if they try UBRS in Fury.
---
 I'm not saying it can't be done BUT, a fresh 60 Warrior that wants to DPS, has No interest in tanking but will do it just to get geared up(Majority of Warriors at start of Vanilla and probably Classic) will fail UBRS unless they spec Prot for the safety net.
---
That is not ANY Warrior in ANY Spec. That's all I'm arguing against. Not ANY Warrior will be tanking effectively outside of Prot.
---
Not everyone quit after wrath. Some of us quit with tbc
---
I’m not gonna convince some clueless dunce that hunters hardcounter rogues lmao. This is common knowledge in vanilla.
---
Cries in Australia.
---
Woops, good catch lol
---
And if i report them you'll be forced to change it :)

There is not a single situation where a good rogue would let a hunter FD/Trap him. You have scorpid surprise, Skull of impending doom... If you dont pick dwarf you are crippling poisoned and will not get a single ranged attack off. Don't act like you know what you're talking about, because it's clear you would be a bad hunter, and a rogue considering you have no idea how high end pvp works.
---
Was an orc warrior and that stun resist was amazing. Saved me many times vs rogues.
---
My girlfriend and I are going Priest/Mage, we didn't really plan it like that, just what we both wanted to play. After thinking about it a bit I believe it would be a pretty strong combo, zero downtime, quick XP from aoe farming, free food/water, got the priest healing if we get into too much trouble, free portals to all the cities.   
---
My advice would just be play a class you want and don't care if it has good synergy
---
I played on silverhand (bloodlust battle group) from 2004 until the end of cataclysm, can confirm I was leonidas the night elf priest talking shit in /2 and /1 stormwind every night for like 10 years. You can literally talk about anything you want on an rp server, you just can't go into cathedral district and crash their rp session unless you want 16 paladins blowing up your whispers with ((Please leave us alone))

---
Playing Warcraft 3 always rehypes me for the horde.
---
&gt; What do Paladins offer and is it significant?
---
Strong single-target heals and buffs.
---
&gt; Why would one roll a Paladin in the first place?
---
They're great healers, if not the best single-target healers in the game.
---
&gt; Will there be so many Paladins on Alliance due to the faction restriction that it will be virtually impossible for a casual player to accomplish raid/dungeon goals?
---
All signs point to yes and no. There will be a lot of paladins, but I doubt many will get to 60. Leveling a Paladin fucking blows.
---
Oh I understand the premise of both scenarios. I just can't think of a reason I would want to go back to a dungeon if I gain nothing from it.
---
Even if people were willing to pay me, I'd probably rather just farm doing something less attentive oriented.
---
As for offering runs for gold I'd just feel greedy. That's just me though. Same with reserving gear. I know I can form a group the way that gets me the most gear, but It just seems like abusing your power as a Tank role.
---
But if people don't care then what the fuck do I bother with my own concerns for lol
---
Getting rich as fuck farming, playing the AH with an addon and patch speculation (which isn’t really speculation since we know the outcome from Vanilla and to some externt pservers).
---
Getting cooking and fishing to 300, win that stv fishing comp that I don’t know anything about really.
---
Raid. MC and BWL is enough for me I think. World PvP with the whole engineering item thing..
---
Neat. I barely remember this. It's it repeatable and horde available?
---
Hit 60
---
Like I said you’re clueless and have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. I feel sorry for you if you play a hunter on Pserver and actually lose to rogues. Though Hunter does have high skill cap in pvp so you should probably reroll come Classic.
---
My first go round with wow I played solo most of the time, could never decide on a character and only made it to level 46. This time my only goal is to commit to a main and join a guild that suits me. That's it.
---
It’s not with copper or gold or currency it’s just drops. Ppl don’t care about certain drops
---
Lol fun read. You made an ass out of yourself
---
Grand Larceny!
---
I want to raid and kill all the bosses with a progression guild.
---
I want [Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22630/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian).
---
Yes. The warlock version.
---
Stop laughing, I know how unlikely it is.
---
I never had a max level character in vanilla.
---
In molten core paladins were cleansebots.
---

---
Just feels weird charging people for help. If I'm going to take my own time to help someone, part of that ^in ^my ^eyes is not expecting reciprocation.
---
I will help people at times but majority of the time I'd rather just focus on more progression for my own character. I'd rather farm the gold myself and watch TV than actually have to pay attention and coordinate with a group just for the same amount of gold. Again, that's just me though. I'm more interested on others consensus of the practices.
---
Ah yeah, that's dope. Totally worth it. Love those wonky items in Vanilla that turned out to be so valuable.
---
Looks like I'll be farming two dungeons come 60. Inner Mara for the Blade, and Strath for the Truefaith pattern. :D
---
Gonna main a troll hunter.
---
There's an engineering hat that casts lightning on all nearby targets.
---
Isnt that that vareesa sanguinar rogue?
---
Don't listen to that guy. Im pretty sure he is knowingly misinforming people.
---
Orc all the way!
---
How? All I've been doing is pointing out that not EVERY Warrior will be able to Fury/Arms tank 60 dungeons. Especially in the fresh server environment where your healer is also in questing gear.
---
I'm an ass for pointing out his ridiculous claim, also the claim that Tanks will be dime a dozen?
---
Buddy's calling me grandpa and acting like he's superior because he's a "modern gamer" and I don't know as much about gamer culture in 2019.
---
Yet I'm the ass?
---
Fucking Reddit's a strange beast.
---
Well now that I know it's a two-roll system, crit would be devalued at your miss rate, so your (hit%) x (crit%) = actualcrit%
---
Great tank healers, useful support, salv is one of the best buffs in the game. Arguably the best PvP healer.
---
That's funny cause I did the same thing and leveled one to 34 in BC. But I'm looking forward to leveling one to 60 in classic, like Stonerox said they're very easy to level and can rack up on gold. Also very powerful in 1v1 pvp.
---
Hello Azula, I just sent a battletag request to try and get more information on what classes you're still needing. I'm also looking for a discord link or website to explore your guild more. I hope to hear back from you soon. My battletag was Worzilla
---
Plank
---
Do items in your bags take durability damage on death?
---
Ok.
---
Two four at the LC... You're an imposter
---
I didn't play Mists until about throne of thunder, I actually had a lot of fun but it definitely wasn't really an MMORPG. I think they MIGHT be able to it.
---
Most of my old Vanilla and RL friends aren't coming back. The ones I still play with on retail don't want to play classic.
---
I'll find a guild and new friend naturally in game but when it comes to farming I'm not going to have any consistent partners or groups off the bat.
---
Most powerful not equal more fun for every player. Some people like some challenge and having to work harder to achieve their goals. 
---
Victory without hard work is not as much satisfying for them.
---
I think the biggest defining trait of retail is that the gameplay sucks, rather than just the expanded setting.
---
Paladins offer the best heals and buffs in the game.
---
Focus on getting a Shaman or Paladin Healer to minimize the chances of competition. 
---
Rolling for and Reserving are two different things. I guess just be upfront about them both.
---
Battleground titles... there won’t even be any battleground at launch.
---
I and a former classmate of mine have similar ambitions. It'd be nice to get a core of at least 10 people together before Classic releases.
---
DM me if you're interested in working together.
---
Talking like you know what you are talking about. That people will pay obscene amounts of gold to have you tank, calling ubrs a 5man while at the sane time calling others for casuals, thinking you need to be prot to tank dungeons at 60. You are in the wrong here.
---
4.2k upvotes but only 1.8k petition signatures
---
You can take those weapons to any forge and break them.
---
I usually pick off the low level guys on the edge then take the tools to the forge in TB and break them there and pick up the harpy feathers quest while I'm there.
---
Just did this on Wormtail's Hand server earlier today.
---
I know that. I was answering OPs question. Launch gonna cover the entire time i play? Nope
---
Are they sought after in raids, or are they a “ugh bring one that’s it” class?
---
Nice one! Saved for level 60!
---
Can your account get banned for that? I too want to buy gold because it's a better use of my RL time to not spend hundreds of hours farming gold when I could just use money
---
Its almost like he plans on playing past phase 1...
---
Being lucky enough to get the mc enchants
---
Don't forget the marathon AV had quests to turn in which gave rep. I remember collecting hair and teeth from bodies for 25 rep every 10 bodies or so.
---
Troll male best hunter race
---
First step towards everybody can do everything. I disagree.
---
It's a small price to pay for a proper tank instead of some retard with green gear and no idea how to tank. On orb runs I usually run with my paladin mate who tanks and I heal, we reserve the first two orbs and we usually find three dpsers in a couple of minutes. And that's on an old server where people are logging Naxx farms. 
---
When Classic is still fresh you'll have a wealth of tanks eager to get their gear, but as more content is released the tanks will become fewer and fewer, especially the good ones. At that point it's easy to charge a price for tanking. 
---
What is extra funny of course is to find an especially obnoxious tank who advertises his services in trade and world chat all day long and just on purpose make him die a lot so he loses money because of durability.
---
I feel that that is the core skill of warrior, and it only gets more impactful with level. 
---
At 30, it's even more important to be fighting  2 mobs at a time, all the way to 36, and once you have whirlwind... you really want to know how to fight multiple mobs. 
---
I also find that in some situations, I cannot cleave effectively, but I feel that they are both rare, and should be minimized.  And mostly can. 
---
I would also note... you only really need a couple cleaves per fight to be rage neutral for a lot of levels of gearing. Even with low mob density, you can drag a mob a very long way if you only need the last 1-2 hits to be while it's next to another mob. Cleaving is often not actually just going toe to toe with 2 mobs all the time. It can just be chaining mobs together with 4 seconds of overlap on each one, and switching targets so that the cleave does not fire prematurely.
---
That’s how it starts.  It quickly escalates to “red is dead” and then just doing everything in ones power to mess with the other guy.
---
It’s a prisoners dilemma.  You could come across a red name and both go about your business, and both be ok with that.  Then again, if he’s content to let you be, you could jump him for a quick rush or to keep him from killing your mobs or farming your nodes.  If you think he’s going to jump you, you are better off jumping him rather than waiting for him to pick his time to jump you.  Since you’re always better off jumping him, and him you, it always ends in a fight, and it always escalates.  
---
First it’s just killing the other guy.  Then it’s letting a mob kill him for the durability hit.  Then it’s mc’ing them off a cliff so they have to spend time climbing back up.  Next you’re spending all your play time camping the defias messenger/traitor, because you’re bored and why not mess with the lowbies.  Pretty soon, the antisocial behavior is just normal and being as hostile as you can to friend and foe alike is second nature.  
---
It’s still fun, just in the same way trolling is fun.  You got a reaction out of someone, and serves them right.  I’m not judging, but that’s the reality of how PvP works.
---
Ye, but the devaluation of crit is overcome by the gains associated with ISB.
---
Thanks for the update! I would prefer no flags vs flags. So I'll be satisfied if this change stays.
---
Was thinking of the son of arugal too when I saw the title. It really scared me when I first bumped into one. 
---
Another place is the crypt in Duskwood with quite high level mobs and a lot of them.
---
I’ve never role played, nor have any idea what you are talking about, but I hope you speak far more respectfully to people in everyday conversation. The only loser here is you.
---
They took out quests in AV that gave 10-25 rep for body loot turnins around the same time of honor system overhaul. It's what got my gnome to late low revered for Darn and AQ finished it for me.
---
That's the problem. Even getting this petition to 2500 doesn't tell Blizzard *anything*.
---
It does on beta.
---
With NE Priest, maximum gankage!
---
Haha this comment killed me.
---
Are you taking into consideration the time you have to eat? If you're down to a single mob and you have to eat after it dies you either use your rage (heroic strike) or lose it and as far as I know warriors will be eating very often while leveling (Which means emptying your rage with Heroic frequently before eating).
---
Not hard at all if you're Resto. Otherwise it'll be a while until people will start taking other shaman specs. Not impossible though, I plan on playing a shaman as well if I go horde.
---
I don't think they will forcefully merge the playerbases together, but they are definitely trying to entice returning players to jump into retail and use the in game shop.
---
It was alt-universe drudging up old lore figures to kill them for loot.  If they were going to do it for the chieftains, they could have at least done the same for Lothar, Llane, and so on.
---

Oh? Got a link?
---
Awesome reply, thanks for taking the time. I feel ya on that stuff and it fits me . I really don't need to be the best of anything, I can strive to be the best lock, but I am just wanting a fun time playing. I played a ton and for many years and should already know these things, but it provides a good outlook from others.
---
Cheers

Something like [this](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=mage&amp;talents=JBJCJDpxq6pyq~q-pPq7q5pWrxwawbpQs4s5s6s7p_wcy~y-pOrerfzazbzcp9pSI9I_I.I~pRrgrhpXrmpZsqsrpYrirjrkrlpNsR).
---
Unless you plan to do AoE leveling, which is not always an option or that easy on Classic vs PServers.
---
&gt; Warlocks, my for-sure first choice for a long time, face a faction full of fear/charm resist when played on Alliance, 
---
It's not really that big of a deal, tbh. It'll be a headache on occasion, but shouldn't stop you from picking that class. 
---
&gt; and then there's shard farming and the debuff limit too.
---
This is what you should be worried about. Shard farming is for the birds and the debuff limit is going to limit what spec you can do. Enjoy spamming shadowbolt as your top dps ability. 
---
&gt; Rogues and Mages are both great, but as a result are viciously overplayed and face competition when gearing.
---
So will everyone else. Remember most classes are going to grab pieces of gear made for other classes because the stats are good. So that dps warrior is gonna have some leather items on. That hunter is also going to grab some leather items, if the stats are good. 
---
&gt; Druids and Paladins feel outclassed nearly entirely in PvE,
---
Classic is the rough draft of this franchise. They tried a couple of things, hit the mark in some areas, and utterly failed in others. Hybrids in Classic are really only good for healing. They have a couple of niche positions, but it's not a complete package and you will be left wanting.
---
In general, though, if you are playing a class that has two roles (or more) you need to be OK with doing at least 2 of the three (or two!). 
---
&gt;  shamans I know very little about so I can't comment.
---
They are similar to paladins. Healing spec is solid, and they perform well in pve and pvp as healers. They will be lacking in the dps department. 
---
It's tough not to be a negative Nessingwary sometimes, but it's also important to understand exactly what you're getting in to so you can manage expectations.
---
And do a 180 if your in a really good mood.
---
I'm watching it in 240p and I can see him blinking.
---
Usually they'd tell you how much they want, I don't remember anyone forgetting to tell you their price unless it was a friend doing it.
---
Trolls are always the best choice, for every class, even priests. 
---
Every time.

You aren’t creating just one German server though, you’re creating a German and a French and a Spanish because if you just do German you’re going to get complaints about favoritism.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
It has been a long time since I've upvoted a longer post after 2nd line. Well done sir.
---
... Now to read the rest :D
---
Everytime...damn tanks. They don't know the feeling...even more when they rage because we let them die for lack of healing
---
Actually read the quests full and experience the story.  Become a crafting and fishing fool. Even though I maxed I really want to get all the best recipes
---
You can put him either group.  You can move shaman while the fight is going too.  Throw him in the group with the mages to drop MTT.
---
Rshaman can't heal and totem twist, also dropping 22 pt into enhancement will seriously gimp their ability to heal.  
---
250 + 120 + 80 + 440 = 890 dps
---
890 vs 1000  Does anyone care that much?
---
I know there's a video somewhere, but I can't seem to find it. It's basically one of the bridges, looks exactly like MoP bridges, just older. And on the coast, there's a bunch of huge turtles the murlocs are living in, on top of them are giant saddles/houses that look exactly like more Pandaria stuff.
---
Honesty I feel like I did everything right in vanilla.. it’s really more of making up for everything I’ve missed out on the last 10 years
---
 **Conclusion**  
---
At all gear levels, crit is marginally more valuable than hit to a warlock. An SM/Ruin warlock in Naxx should value crit at around 12sp, while a pre-raid warlock should value it closer to 10.  
---
**"Why is that your conclusion?" - Calculating base E\[D\]**  
---
E\[D\] is expected damage, or the average damage of any given spell including its miss and crit chance.  
---
For the sake of simplicity, expected damage ignores spell resistance by assuming that the player is able to fight the boss with 0 resistance.  
---
Suppose our character is a warlock with the following properties:  
---
\* Shadow Bolts hits do on average 1,000.  
---
\* Shadow Bolt crits do on average 2,000.  
---
\* Has 0% +hit (0.83 chance to hit PvE boss)  
---
\* Has 5% +crit (0.05 chance to crit any spell that lands)  
---
**We can determine E\[D\] by doing:**  
---
((Average Bolt Hit Damage) \* (Probability of a regular "hit") + (Average Spell Crit Damage) \* (Probability of the spell being a "crit.") ) \*(Hit Chance)  
---
&gt;*(1000)(0.95) + (2000)(0.05) ) 0.83 = E\[D\]*  
---
*E\[D\] = 871*
---
This means that once all misses and crits are counted, the average damage of our warlock's shadow bolt is 871.  
---
**Tuning \[E\]D for Improved Shadow Bolt DD**  
---
We need to incorporate the direct damage gained from the Improved Shadow Bolt debuff.  
---
An easy way to approximate this in our calculation is to multiply our Shadow Bolt E\[D\] by 0.8 (20% for four bolts), and adding that value the damage of our initial critical strike as though it was dealt entirely by the one warlock rather than distributed across the raid.  
---
E\[D\] \* 0.8 = 704 additional direct damage provided to raid every time our warlock crits.  
---
(This approximation assumes that the caster’s damage is close to the raid’s average. Very geared players will have their crit value lowered very slightly by under-geared players, and vice versa, but this variance shouldn’t be a significant source of error.)  
---
**Tuning \[E\]D for Improved Shadow Bolt DoT**  
---
But wait! Improved Shadow Bolt also increases all shadow damage by 20% for its duration. Assume there are 6 shadow casters and \~150 of their DPS comes from DoTs, you gain an additional \~360 damage from the power added to DoT ticks for the duration, assuming that the debuff is up for one second.  
---
This is a fairly safe assumption, because with 6 warlocks unloading, you’re looking at \~210 shadow bolts per minute, or 3.5 per second (fewer than four.)  
---
**Diminishing Returns**  
---
The improved shadow bolt debuff does not stack beyond four. This means that consecutive crits which overlap provide reduced efficiency.  
---
Two back to back crits yeilds 75% inefficiency for the improved shadow bolt debuff of the first crit, because only one charge of the debuff could be used. This reduction can be found by determining the probability of two crits occurring back to back. If we assume six warlocks per raid are casting 210 shadow bolts per minute with a 15% chance to crit each, our P|CC is 2.25%  
---
To draw an arbitrary line, assume our encounter allows our warlocks to shadow bolt for one minute. During this time we anticipate 210 shadowbolts, 32 of which will be crits, 178 of which will be non-crits or N. We can then look for the probability of there not being enough N's to give any C's that occur their full value.  
---
&gt;*P|CC = 0.0225*  
---
*P|N = .1275*  
---
*P|NN = 0.108*  
---
*P|NNN = 0.092*  
---
*P|NNNN = 0.078*
---
As you can see, the probability of there being just one "N" between two crits is 12.75%. This means that 12.75% of our crits, four of them, will have 50% inefficiency.  
---
We know that 0.72 (one) will receive 25% inefficiency.  
---
We know .1275 of those (four of them) will receive 50%.  
---
We know 10.8% or 3.4 (round to four) should receive 75%.  
---
Another way to describe this is to say 6/32 crits will receive no bonus damage from improved shadow bolt. This is a 18.75% loss.  
---
**Final Math**  
---
&gt;*(DoT ticks gains + Direct Damage Gains) \* Efficiency Coefficent = Total Gained from Imp Shadow Bolt*  
---
*(360 + 704)\*0.81 = 861*  
---
*((1000)(0.95) + (2861)(0.05))(.83) = E\[D\] = 907*
---
E\[D\] After Including Improved Shadow Bolt  
---
At last, our warlock’s E\[D\] with improved shadow bolt has been clocked at 907.  
---
What if we raise her crit by 1%?  
---
&gt;*(1000)(0.94) + (2861)(0.06) \*(.83) = E\[D\] = 922*
---
Raise hit by 1%, reset crit to base 5?  
---
&gt;*(1000 \* .95 + 2861 \* .05) 0.84 = E\[D\] = 918*
---
Raising crit by 1% was a 15 E\[D\] increase.  
---
Raising hit by 1% was an 11 E\[D\] increase.  
---
Notice that this margin of difference favors crit even when we're receiving diminishing returns from improved shadow bolt.  
---
**Final Thoughts**  
---
Given the TheoryCraft addon or some simple calculations, we might be inclined to value crit as highly as 18 SP per 1%, but you also have to keep in mind that as SM/Ruin about 15% of your damage comes from corruption. This means that even in pre-raid gear, about 15%+ of your damage will receive no benefit from crit/hit because the affliction hit cap is a freebie, and DoTs don’t crit.
---
Killer boots, Man!
---
In the north of hinterlands there was a hidden paths that that led North out of the zone.
---
When I emerged from the brush, there was death all around. All the animals were diseased and sickly looking, with open sores. Infected squirrels. Trees dead or dying. The land itself just seemed to be infected.
---
I noped the fuck out of there.
---
Easy to get in, hard to gear
---
I never made any of those claims. I never claimed I know what I'm talking about, I openly admitted ^twice I'm only going off my own anecdotal evidence from vanilla tanking and watching Top Tank streams and content.
---
I mistakenly used UBRS as an example when I meant any 5 man 60. Like I said, the last time UBRS was actually seen as a raid was a long LONG time ago (unless you play Pservers I guess) even at the end of Vanilla ppl were 5 maning it.
---
I never once said people will pay obscene amounts of gold for tanks. I asked a question and tried to start a discussion about other people doing it, as it's frequently done in retail and Pservers(according to other posts)
---
I never said you had to be Prot. I was calling BS on his claim that "ANY Warrior in ANY spec" can tank 60 dungeons.
---
Well a fresh 60 that doesn't know how to tank and is only doing it for DPS gear and is in quest greens isn't tanking 60 dungeons effectively with a quest green healer.
---
So no, ANY Warrior can't tank them in ANY spec. Many will try as soon as they hit 60 and decide to go Prot for the safety net and make it easier on healers.
---
I don't feel wrong since all I've seen is people claiming I'm saying something I'm not or not even bothering to stay on topic.
---
Yes you can get banned for buying gold.
---
If they capped respec at 25g it would take way more out of the economy than leaving it at 50g.
---
Going to play alliance this time and going to play warrior tank so people want me in a group, compared to playing an orc hunter the first go around and having to beg for spots because hunters were a dime a dozen.
---
Here's the thing. Unless you're a top tier player, and I mean someone intending to eke out every last minuscule drop of potential from your class -- it just doesn't matter!
---
Pick the class you want to play and for the most part you will do fine as long as you find a playstyle that you enjoy. Some classes are sort of hamfisted into specific roles (hybrids are pretty universally healers for instance) but you can overcome that gap with enough gear to some extent.
---
it's always against ToS but yolooooooo.
---
This is amazing! In 13 years I’ve never known this!
---
I mean, it tied up Garrosh pretty well and had some fantastic raids. Plus it setup Gul'dan for Legion, which was a great expansion. I'd rather them use alternate universe mumbo jumbo to give us true villains we know a lot about than invent new ones. That was largely the issue with MoP's story.
---
From what I've heard once you get T2 you can start Tanking 5 Man's and UBRS and do some AoE farming.
---
That's a lot of work to just be geared enough to be subpar at either though.
---
I'm pretty sure there wasn't one that hit as hard.
---
My favorite thing was due to some programming error or possibly just an oversight but the Halberd's proc could proc of Seal of Command and vice versa, making for some truly devestating hits from a Ret paladin, sometimes coming close to one shotting an opponent in Plate.
---
I just want to get that Benediction so much man...
---
It’s like 5 dps or something if I’ve been properly informed.
---
If you give that much of a shit about 5 dps, then more power to you.
---
Simple for me. Complete each Raid at least once.  
---
I started TBC so I never got the chance to do Vanilla raids.
---
Apollogies for the late reply.  DI cheesing razorgore is when you 'Divine Intervention' him to remove him from the combat encounter table, then wipe your raid.  
---
The encounter scripting will not know how to handle this, and fail to reset properly, allowing you to kill him without the usual fight mechanics.
---
I’d switch to tailoring early when you know you will get it to 250. Start making that mooncloth ASAP! I went with tailoring/herb on my priest and just ignored tailoring while leveling. Herb was for DM east farming.
---
You mean front flip your way in xxLegolasxx style.
---
Yes of course, but that's why you don't deal directly with the gold farmers on your main account. You buy it on a throwaway account and then launder the gold legitimately.
---
Dwarf shaman is just my jam aesthetically. No care about racials, just love that crazy hammer swinging bolt tossing wildhammer look. 
---
Luckily I have that in BFA. Unfortunately BFA shaman is boring (atleast compared to MoP).
---
But doing a dungeon multiple times will deck you all out in good gear making each run and the next dungeon easier.
---
Still good for alts and casuals looking for a raid slot, though.
---
This video was dislikes by smelly warlocks.
---
Huh, never knew that. Cool.
---
They're the best single-target healers in the game. The only types of Paladins that don't get invited are the ones that don't spec Holy and wear cloth.
---
They posses the greatest utility.  
---
Their not OP.
---
No, only using the Spirit Resurrection from the graveyard forces items in your bag to take durability damage.
---
Lorewise, I think trolls are the best archers on the Horde. PvE also troll and for PvP definitely Orc
---
focus on the positives instead of the negatives.  If you're only looking for flaws in a class then you're only gonna see the flaws.
---
Why would a warrior ever run strat live with randoms if he isn't being payed? He won't need anything from there.

You’re the tank and the group leader in this situation. You set the rules when forming the group and it’s up to everyone else to decide whether or not they’re ok with it. If you find it hard to form a group then you might have to rethink your rules. 
---
Side note on righteous orbs specifically:  
---
I still remember a top mage on my vanilla server who would lead Strat live runs  for months and only claim the first righteous orb on reserve. After that it was 1 per person /roll with him rolling for a second. He wouldn’t roll for a third though and never had to wait long to form a group that way.
---
Can we stop with these posts?
---
r/classicplus to discuss this already beaten horse.
---
Gear takes a long time to assemble through raids. I'd rather do that in down time if you have the gold cuz it's quite expensive.
---
If those turtles are anything like the ones in Darkshore then you have the Naga to blame for the carriages, not the Pandaren. The bridge could have any number of explanations.
---
I'm with you honestly. Those two zones would have been a lot easier on the whole adventurer dynamic we had instead of going and killing one of the most famous characters and one of the biggest bad guys even though he wasn't full strength.
---
That 2 pc set bonus seems pretty sick, if it procs often enough.  Have a rdruid blanket the rogues and warriors with rejuv.
---
This was what I did and cloth grind took ages
---
Just try it with something on the far wall of the room you're in. Unless you're in a closet, I guess.
---
Blood elves, aliens, no faction specific classes, flying mounts, dailies. Everything wrong with retail began in BC.
---
Yep, surprised me. 2.4 and 3.1 respectively :(

---
Think the only thing I remember people paying for a tank or heal was attunement related.
---
No, I am just observing what actually happens when I play the game. I try to bandage on cooldown, I try to eat no more than I need to, but of course, this might change a lot as hamstring kiting is still up in the air for classic.
---
Even when you eat.... it's not that much rage. A full level 25 food is 27 seconds, and I almost never use an entire food duration (because I don't have that much max health, that I can sit for 27 seconds and the food regen+the spirit regen +my elixir regen won't cap me on health). 
---
That would be 27 rage base, but you gain 8.9 rage from anger management.
---
So a full heal from EATING is ~18 rage at level 25-35, and less from 20-25.  It is nowhere near emptying your rage pool. 
---
Beyond that the decision to end with a heroic strike is usually based on if you think it will kill or not, rather than if you actually have rage or not. If you don't think 44 bonus damage (like half of an autoattack at best) will make the difference in number of swings to kill, heroic strike does nothing. So why empty your rage pool before eating? if you are that low on rage, just prematurely refresh battle shout, and if you are not that low on rage, bank it. 
---
So it's not really a huge sacrifice just to not kill the last mob before pulling with heroic strikes, and by no means should you be zeroing your rage pull
---
Last stress test a buddy and myself had more fun trying to find boars to kill than doing anything else. We were running around just attempting to tag one before anyone else.
---
2005 finest.
---
&gt; Paladins feel outclassed nearly entirely in PvE 
---
He doesn't know pepelaugh
---
I keep bringing it into my center. I must be doing something wrong.
---
Kinda how I feel about rolling a troll priest. Everyone goes undead, so I’ll be one of the only trolls rolling around.
---
Maybe? I honestly never much paid attention to the blood elf NPCs on account of I hated their being a Horde race in the first place.
---
Even if you were the only one, that is like one free coffee a month !!!
---
Do you know ppm?
---
Keep in mind that a light cake (sponge etc) or other cake-like dishes (waffles, pancakes) or even donuts could be mounted on a trolls tusks, leaving hands free for other activities.
---
It’s a single use Alliance quest enchant, however you could cast it on a non-binding white or gray weapon and transfer to Horde via the neutral AH.
---
Where is suramar mentioned anywhere other than legion?
---
What kind of server are you looking for? Location, type, etc.
---
Unless you already have one!
---
Usually if you tell everyone that you are farming the instance for a drop, not many people will care. If you truly are a prot Warrior, no one else will be able to really use your gear outside of weapons.
---
For instance, if you’re farming UBRS for the Draconian Deflector and tell everyone up front that you are here for that, I wouldn’t roll on it.
---
My doubt in the priest run was not with princess (she seems easy for priest) but with packs getting to her.
---
OK so Ret is terrible in Vanilla and even in TBC, Holy paladins are 2 button healers, and Prot is w/e. Are they good? Yes they offer a lot to both PvP and PvE. Are they exciting, fun, and challenging? No. Not in the slightest.
---
the dragon isles did exist, it wasn't just an "island that is there but not in the story" like GM island. and even gm island is technically in the lore as a real thing. the game literally has a built in 4th wall in lore
---
Stop caring about minmaxing.
---
And this is why this sub is going to shit. 8h and only 17 upvotes, while stupid memes about streamers and dead horse discussions are being upvoted to the front.
---
Great job OP! Saving this for the future!
---
I was very young when vanilla came out. I had about 3 or 4 characters I got to about level 10-15ish and after that I would just run around Goldshire and Stormwind just hanging out and talking to people and honestly it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in a game, despite even properly playing it. 
---
This time around, I plan on recreating those characters and actually getting them to level 60 and experiencing what really was WoW in all its glory. 
---
And then after that? Probably run around in Goldshire and Stormwind and just hangout and talk to people.
---
&gt; You could come across a red name and both go about your business, and both be ok with that.
---
Why would join a PVP server if you didn't want to kill the other faction on site though?
---
you join it specifically to fuck with each other in this scenario. it is what makes it fun.
---
Figuring out a way to escape a high level camper etc is satisfying and part of the fun too.
---
I have planned the first 9 days out, so that I can pretty much play as much as I want. I Have the luxury to be able to sometimes play at work when working nights ;)
---
Going alliance rogue (probably female dwarf) all my friends are playing alliance so thats why.
---
Going to lvl an alt as well and its either going to be a hunter or a mage.
---
Playing EU-servers.
---
The place they imported the data to(retail engine) . It's really not hard to understand for most people.
---
I've seen tips to mages since vanilla, at least where I played it was commonplace to give 1g for a stack
---
Atiesh is typically given as a reward to the most dedicated raid member who can use it, not whichever class needs it the most for their DPS. Since when you get Atiesh you'll already have cleared Naxx a hundred times, there's no point in mix maxing your raid. So there's nothing really outlandish about a warlock, or even priest having it.
---
Still torn on what I’m going to go. Going to be playing Alliance with some friends who will vary in classes, though I know there’ll be a Warrior/Hunter duo that I’ll tag along with as well as a Warrior/Mage duo, as well as solo so leveling I’m not too concerned about. 
---
Been wondering about Druids lately. I know I’d be healing at 60 though Druid healing seems interesting, only have a little experience with Paladin healing if that’s any comparison. I’ve heard raids don’t bring many Druids and idk how dungeons would go if there wasn’t another class with a more reliable Res spell. Have heard Feral is decent in dungeons but I’m assuming their actual DPS is pretty low? On par with Ret I’m guessing. PvP seems interesting as they’re the main FCs in WSG but idk how they do otherwise in other BGs and open world. Looking for input into this to see if this might be an option for me. 
---
Otherwise I’m looking at Mage (get to DPS but seems a bit boring overall though pvp seems fun but there will be a ton of them), Paladin (Ret/Holy hybrid but still on fence overall), Rogue (nice DPS, lots of them but rotation in PvE seems a bit stale? More exciting then Mage but still, pvp great but idk how leveling wise they do), Warrior (lowest on list as I’d prefer 2H play style overall plus getting to the level of being awesome takes a lot longer)
---
All input and advice is greatly appreciated!
---
It's a good way to hide and open up on people.  Especially a BG like WSG where your job is to defend the base.
---
I think that's the gnomer boss drop helmet no?
---
Rep, Blacksmithing, Quests, the chance to roll on orbs, Mask of the Unforgiven. 
---
And just because something isn't uber pre-BIS, doesn't mean it's not useful, so you have: Crown of Tyranny, Vambraces of the Sadist, Skul's Fingerbone Claws, and Master Cannoneer Boots.
---
I like to compare it to going to a good university vs. a local community college. If you have awesome gear (good university), it’ll get you in the door anywhere. However, if you have shit gear (community college), you’re going to have to prove your worth to everyone.
---
I got lucky and fell into the MT job and your point is pretty valid. There are 40+ people in a guild and only one MT.
---
Now we are at -15 hours, great stuff ! Only 1433 hours left !
---
Dwarf is only for blind, poisons can be dispelled with tons of other items.
---
I wonder if a Balance Druid has ever seen KT. I guess they all lacked personality, skill and determination.
---
Have you given some thought to priest? Shadow can be fun and decent in PvP. Disc too if you want an annoying you can’t kill me spec. And holy is great for raids.
---
Still rough as a prot Warrior. I’d do herb and alchemy and every time I got into a PvP fight I’d barely win or get utterly demolished as I was picking herbs.
---
Ret Paladins that stack spell power (Judgment tier 2 is near BIS), a fast weapon (Manual Crowd Pummeler is BIS), and proc gear, must have Shadow Oil and Dragonfire Chili(?) are a strong DPS class. Ret Paladins that stack strength are not so much. So yes, not only are Ret Paladins viable but they can also be good, just below the best specs like Fury Warrior and Combat Rogue.
---
Yeah, it seems you're right about the turtles. I just read the quest text and while it's not 100% confirmed Naga, it might as well be.
---
But that bridge in SoS is straight out of Pandaria.
---
Its 1.12 data tables, with 8.x systems, that are being converted to 1.12 emulated systems.  I suspect without even a 1.12 server source code.
---
What a shitshow.
---
I still maintain that Grim Batol makes for a very good Horde/Alliance quest hub in the vicinity of level 38 - 45. It gives additional content to the otherwise barren (content wise) east side of Wetlands, and it increases horde/alliance foot-traffic in the area. 
---
Seeing more fights break out on the bridge between Wetlands and Arathi would be an interesting dynamic.
---
So in my memory from doing it on a pserver, there are only two packs that were problematic.
---
The first is the elemental swarm that has a short patrol up and down the hallway right at the beginning. You had to time your move carefully to not aggro. The second is the group of three crocs just after the elemental pack. You can sneak by when they 'wander' away from the left wall, but even if you aggro it's not too hard to kill them. Nothing else past that point presents a risk (and you can mind soothe the giants at the end of the path just before Princess).
---
But since we know pservers got a lot of stuff wrong, the packs may be positioned slightly differently or have slightly different pathing and not leave enough space even for a level 60 to get by.
---
99% of the time the best players are gonna be playing optimally, playing shit like a nelf priest is gonna flag you as a low iq rper
---
There's no way someone hasn't done kt on balance druid.
---
Or Pandaria just likes reusing assets.
---
There is also a lot of lore built into warcraft 1 to 3 that would also add the demon planets.
---
Because it was the one most changed from 1.12 to 8.X and the developers have no source code, just source tables.
---
Its not.
---
Elemental shaman is pretty good at pvp at 60 man. Enhancement is gimmicky but fun.  Rogues are a great choice too, with being way better for world pvp, but they are CD dependent and can be a nuisance to play as in big fights in PvP (looking at you AV)
---
Yes to be in the 99% of players. But to kill KT it doesn't take that. I guarantee you videos of kt kills from original classic you won't see 100% Dwarf priests.
---
There's no other place that bridge model is used besides the one place in SoS until MoP. And it's Asian as fuck.
---
I can hear the laugh
---
Originally, yes. But they were added to the other cities before TBC.
---
I'll take the shit dwarf priest over the amazing balance druid, thanks.
---
RIP Danny antonucci killed in cold blood by Canadian cops.
---
Yeah, but [they are definitely going to reinstate the delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2286)
---
Who set that fire to "blazing gates of hell" mode?
---
Well let's keep going down this rabbit hole.
---
You're slim and read comics?
---
If you’re doing that though enhancement might be the way to go, at least up to improved windfury.
---
Yeah, I think they are keeping the 12 slots but restoring the 1 hour mail delay.
---
No, I don't think the Walmart of MMOs has anything to learn from a Mom and Pop corner store.
---
Well I did go human so I had less rep to grind :)
---
Stuff like this reminds me that some people play the game very, very differently than I do. Can someone remind me why we're racing to 60?
---
Sure 99% of the time the best players are playing optimally.
---
They're still the vast minority of the player base.
---
Hahah Naw I'm actually from good ol samskatchewatnow
---
Remember darnassus had that additional way of gaining reputation - morrowgrain handins I think? I can't remember the exact mechanics but you had some kind of item with a cooldown that turned soil from ungoro into grain, then this gave darnassus rep.
---
My memory is hazy but i vaguely remember using this to power up darn rep so i barely needed any runecloth handins and had a tiger on my human warrior really fast.
---
I’m not sure what your point is. I don’t think anyone’s ever argued that content isn’t able to be cleared if you bring suboptimal specs, the thing is that your race/spec are revealing as to the kind of player you are. The best guilds aren’t going to want to take you because everyone else is putting in max effort and having someone that clearly doesn’t care is going to piss people off. It’s really not that complicated, just play what you want but don’t expect to get in an actual good guild if you’re going to play something that’s obviously worse. But if you’re playing some shit just for aesthetics you likely weren’t going to face that issue anyway.
---
\&gt; you want to play a Night Elf Rogue but Shadowmeld becomes nearly useless 
---
People underrate the usefulness of eating while invisible in the world! I also love that it's a 10s cd. Ok, it's probably the worst useable racial in the game, but it's still super cool! Which is exactly the point.
---
I want to exclusively play Prot Paladin tanking.
---
It doesn't matter if im Terry Crews with charisma and determination, I'm going to have a hard time just finding 5 man groups when I ding 60. If so want to step foot in a raid Im dreaming unless I respec.
---
That means another Warrior for me.
---
Most players are absolutely braindead, some people enjoy being able to play with a guild where everyone has an iq above 75.
---
It occurs to me that I didn't entirely read the original comment because I was already familiar with a different way of doing it.. Now that I try it, bringing the triangle towards me does nothing for me either.
---
The test I know involves framing the object the same way but then just looking through with different eyes closed. For example, when I close my left eye the view is the unchanged, while when I close my right the view is shifted out of the triangle, so I am right eye dominant. If it was the opposite I'd be left eye dominant.
---
But trying to find a warrior who's more interested in some rep or semi-good pieces rather than spending their time running UBRS or BRD to get BiS-gear will take a long time.
---
What a weird thing to say. You don't need to min/max to be, "worth a shit."
---
Jesus fucking Christ, how are you still whining about layering?  It wasn't a real problem to begin with, and they still fixed it.
---
On Classicdb there’s another comment saying “10% proc rate confirmed”. If true then this is an amazing dagger for Mage aoe farming.
---
60$ for a whole new game. That's 4 months of WoW. There are not many games out there that actually have 4 months of proper content, unless you play like 1 hour per week. There are a few outliers such as Skyrim, but they're super rare. Money/time is generally best spend in f2p games such as Dota 2, but 15$ per month is absolutely not much and there's not much competition in the field worth getting.
---
Holy Paladins are amazing for raids from start to finish of the game. They scale very well, and their buffs and auras are always welcome. You should have no issues getting a raid invite.
---
&gt;playing shit like a nelf priest is gonna flag you as a low iq rper
---
Saying shit like this makes you seem like a low iq tryhard.
---
To be fair, she was like Dany from Season 2 of Game of Thrones at that point.
---
She hadn't gone full season 8 yet.
---
Rp frog spotted
---
Pallies can do 5 mans easy
---
Nah, just a pvper with a very large mute list of basic players like you.
---
It varied in a few patches as they experimented, but it was snapshot for the longest time, even through TBC iirc.  It was expected that you would have your lifebloom snapshot with a pre-combat potion and stuff if you were good.
---
or because blizzard just literally ignored all criticisms and bug reports during the beta of their last wow expansion and pushed out absolute garbage while letting it stay that way for a year
---
nah i meen peepo jus buddhurt
---
Now I take offense to at least one of those things. Just because my pap never had no fancy "electricity or running water" when he was growing up, doesn't mean we stupid people.
---
We stupid on account of the government putting stupid juice in our water.
---
I really hope the "REEE I'm being killed when I just want to quest!!" crowd doesn't ruin this version of WoW as well. If you want safe, wiener-gameplay, then stay on retail with nice, soft, cushy warmode.
---
Rpers are SEETHING right now
---
That was when things got fun. Being oom and the tank says screw You im pulling. That’s when you know if you can hack or not in the horde world.
---
You don't need nearly that much gear to tank 5 man's at 60. You can tank in full blues as long as your group recognizes that you aren't a warrior. They need to give you a few seconds for threat and realize that you will need to drink a lot. But you can also round up and aoe a lot of trash at once to make up that time.
---
Okay, Demi.
---
It really depends. I'm doing office work and I already knew it would have been like this even before I accepted the job (and they pay be for 8 hours flat). But I really like it even if I'm super stressed at the end of the day. So... It's really ok. The post was only about finding time for classic :) the difficult thing to do is to don't bring work problems at home :)
---
What about tanking? Are they good for that in dungeons or even raids? Or are warriors the go to?
---
Go back to The Donald.
---
All the vitamins and minerals the body needs
---
Haha, no way. Remember the Bust/Illya drama? What was your name?
---
Night Elf architecture is Asian as well.
---
Nah, Cairne would have been a shit warchief. He bet his life in a duel based on evidence fabricated by the Twilight's Hammer. That wasn't smart. And his son is a straight up traitor to the Horde.
---
You too, eh? I already have plans for one character of every class plus an extra hunter and druid. Half of them meme specs because I'm one o' *those.*
---
Um.... what?
---
haHAA, casual idiot doesn’t like TD, go figure.
---
Just finished watching your level 1-5 dwarf priest play through on YouTube! I really want to see if my old laptop that I used to play wotlk on will run it now...
---
Subscribed, btw :)
---
Wooa. Come on. When we went to Montreal, or as they say in Quebec MoHrEEEALLLL, for a school trip they pretty much discouraged us from even trying to learn French. They didn't seem the least bit interested in preventing bigotry.
---
This is totally sensible advice but seems ridiculously backwards to do the activity that necessitates more people when you have access to more people.
---
Scuffing can be useful. Paint typically doesn't adhere well to smooth or polished surfaces. Scuffing the material with sandpaper or a scotchbrite pad will vastly improve adhesion, but make sure to clean the surface well before applying paint. Acetone works well for this on metallic surfaces.
---
The mask is BIS. And not everyone cares about raiding. They'll always be plenty of tanks wanting to do it.
---
Tank all dungeons.
---
Its not great, but not terrible.  
---
It gives you something like 10% resist against Fire and Shadow which is pretty good before people get spell penetration.
---
The biggest disadvantage to rolling Alliance at all is having to play alongside gnomes.
---
In 40 man raids there was always a hunter out of ammo, it was almost guaranteed.
---
&gt;People like you are the best to repeatedly shit on in game cuz you can tell you actually get mad lmaooo  
---
&gt; I can't control when you snowflakes decide your feelings get hurt 
---
It's like reading Trumps twitter. You're a joke.
---
The fuck is socializing?
---
I always used to keep some runes on my warlock, and if I needed a port somewhere, I'd give the mage one instead of a tip. Never had anyone say no to that
---
I think to a lot of us it's pretty obvious HorriblePerson was having fun with it and then you decided to actually get your panties in a twist.
---
Dozens. Literally Dozens of them!
---
Honestly, I am going to level alts. 
---
I don't see much value in earning gold at 60, because while you make a lot less money prior to 60, you get another character, which is both interesting and valuable. 
---
I really haven't decided what it will be, but I think It will be a strong battleground pvp class, probably mage or druid. maybe hunter. 
---
One of the biggest reasons I want to move from private servers is to have account wide friends lists, rather than character to character friends lists. I already, on private servers, use all 10 character slots (mostly for having 7+ different warriors). 
---
Honestly, I just really like leveling, and tend to do it well enough that I make money doing it. If I turn out to get serious about raiding.... I will probably farm gear tanking dungeons, and be casual enough I don't need to bring a flask to every raid.... or any raid. I also really don't expect or even necessarily aspire to be the main tank of a raiding guild. To be honest, 5 man content IS the game for me, so far. And while I really enjoy tanking it, I don't expect to be dedicated enough to justify 40 people relying on me.
---
Imagine pvping as hunter without entrapment and using frost traps like a boss.
---
5 layer burrito ?
---
Virtually serious
---
You’d really enjoy the creation of Classic video.
---
You clearly misunderstand the process which has been done.
---
One of the biggest factors for using a retail client is portability.
---
Blizzard customer service - Battle.net integration - cheat prevention software - are all retail systems that should be implemented.
---
It saves them hundreds of hours of going through and hack-jobbing vanilla to make it happen. 
---
They’ve explained this several times. 
---
Take off the tinfoil hat.
---
I'm pretty sure u/Phenotyx got salty there. He took HP6 a little too seriously.
---
Maybe if vanilla raiding was actually competitive you'd have a point.
---
Didn't they just change some shit about it? I don't even  care about it really, but didn't they?
---
This rper is absolutely FUMING right now
---
It’s alright. Warlock on Alliance is actually decent because you don’t have to deal with Pallies auto-cleansing all your spells.
---
Mage may be overplayed, but you could fit 8 or more in a raid easily! Dont worry!
---
Shadow priestis viable dps.
---
Shaman can dps in PVP too. And Paladin, while sometimes dull, is the best support class in the game so you will have huge value to your teammates.
---
And Hunters are good at everything and not too popular. Try that too.
---
True, but you also have to feel a little shame for choosing to play as a pigtailed little girl when you had the option to be a giant bull man.
---
&gt; Language division is also community division and them not wanting to do that shows that they're not sure if the community would survive such a fractioning.
---
Forcing people who can't really communicate with each other together doesn't make for a unified community, just a very toxic one. I remember the vile behaviour of Americans towards the Chinese on private servers and I have absolutely no desire to relive that.
---
*waiting for your fourth consecutive reply*
---
I came to the convo late. You can take your time responding, the posts aren't going anywhere.
---
   Hi all, is there any particular class that I should be aware of that is useful to guildmates outside of raids. Long story short I can't commit to a full time raid schedule due to work conflicts. However I want to be as useful as possible when I am playing on off nights. Just theory crafting maybe  playing a rogue with herba/alchemy for locksmithing boxes and consumables would be the best in my situation. But any other suggestions would be very much appreciated,
---
Thanks
---
Still waiting on that alternate reality WC 4.
---
TAKE ALL MY MONEY. Wow classic + WC 4 during server down time.
---
I'll die happy
---
Mages arent great in pve until AQ.
---
Rogues are never top 1 dps (unless your warriors are slackers).
---
Paladins are top tier healers, not sure what you on about.
---
I've seen druids top healing meters.
---
Warriors are top tier dps throughout entire game (except during leveling).
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome idea/"mechanic" by Blizzard though.

Here a streamer discusses solutions to the layer solution:

The only people on my 2 servers to get it were priests.
---
They did. Several of clips from the video are also bugs (random layering and being layered while being invited in a group on the same layer) or people accepting party invites mid fight on another layer getting layered how it's supposed to be. 
---
People like to scream without checking once what they're posting :/
---
Blocked attacks cannot crit unless they are yellow special hits.
---
Actually level professions to max, and make bank when I do.
---
It's not about how long you took it's that you felt the need to comment on 3 different threads lmao
---
people tossing around the word "salty" in most of their comments tend to be the funniest to watch though glad you and HorriblePerson6 found each other :) I didn't think he'd fine someone with a worse /u/ lmao 
---
Are u the real demi Lovato?
---
Yes
---
Dear god I'll never forget Black Morass when BC launched...As a gnome I'd have to swim thru every damn bit of water
---
I just play the AH at work to fund my tank.
---
I am going to read all the books in Scarlet Monastery
---
Ah alright, that's more than I knew.
---
Is nelf priest bad, or is it just not a dwarf?
---
Uh, I haven't even played the beta, it was just a suggestion.
---
What class did you play as?
---
Hmm still seems trackable
---
Maybe I'm getting old but that's how these things typically work. If I see a post I want to respond to, I respond to it. I don't go through and find your "best" post that I want to respond to. Messages on here are just as much for lurkers and other people to read as they are for you to respond back to. 
---
I was enjoying yours and HP6's back and fourth until you got mad and tried to make it seem like he was the one getting angry. And no, I'm not actually Demi Lovato. I'm just a very, very pretty man with her eyebrows.
---
ISB can also compound on itself if you get back-to-back crits. But also keep in mind that ISB is shared by all warlocks so if you have 5 locks chances are quite slim that you'll enjoy your own ISB. They also increase periodic damage even though they shouldn't so your corruption gets a boost as well. 
---
You can calculate the probability that any of your 4 last casts was a crit.  So if you have 20% crit and 90% hit you have a 0.2 x 0.9 = 18% chance to hit and crit while 100 - 18 = 72% chance of a normal hit (and 10% chance of missing). So the probability of your last shadowbolt being a crit is 18%, multiply that by 4 and you have a 72% chance of your bolt being affected by ISB. 
---
It increases the damage by 20% on a non-crit and 0.2 x 2 = 40% on a crit. I.e a 1000 damage bolt will do 1200 damage with ISB up, will crit for 2000 without ISB and will crit for 2400 with ISB. You still have an 18% chance to hit and crit so that gives you a 0.72 x 0.18 = 12,96% chance of getting a crit while ISB is up. 
---
The damage buff from a normal hit is then on average 0.72(chance of ISB being up) x 0.72(chance of normal hit) x 0.2 = 10.37%. The damage buff from crits are then 0.1296 x 0.4 = 5.51%. Add them together and you get a 10.37% + 5.51% = 15.88% increase. 
---
But again it's not a good way of judging your own benefit because it's the other warlocks who get your ISB. So for top personal dps you should probably disregard ISB entirely or at least greatly reduce it's significance.
---
“With paladin we had no breaks”
---
Tell me more about this SP ret paladin. I mained pally vanilla through TBC and I've never heard such a thing. Do you have more info? Specs, gearset, maybe a guide somewhere? 
---
&gt;just below the best specs like Fury Warrior and Combat Rogue.
---
Verrrrrrry strong claim
---
It’s by far the worst priest race, you can still clear content but it’s a bit of a meme cause it’s mostly egirls and rpers that play nelf priest.
---
dunno, but after this post I'm afraid to interact with anyone
---
Yeah, soul shards last forever. You can store them in your bank too.
---
They Will stay in bags until used, so no prob pre farming
---
I never download memes to my phone, but this struck me a deep level and I have to show it multiple people this week. Amazing, OP
---
Soul shards don’t get deleted, the items you create with them do though.
---
Shards only disappear when you use them or remove them. You can even put them to the bank for safety stock.
---
So you can't strafe to the side?
---
Bottom left - hunter - beast master, survival, marksmanship. Mid left - warlock - destruction, demonology, affliction.
---
Funny how I have played rogue the most and am clueless which one it is. Maybe top mid.
---
Good luck with that when there isn't a dedicated English speaking server. Get better internet. My fibre gives me sub 100 ping to US.
---
Mists is one of my favorite post WotLK expansions. It was pretty great. The panda hate is pretty dumb.
---
I mean since there's already an automatic name checker on character creation, couldn't they just expand the database to check names on each of the cluster too?
---
Ie: create name &gt; server checks illidan 1, 2 and 3 to see if name is taken &gt; return result to player.
---
&gt; If there is a reason to chose a spec over all the others, then that spec is viable. If that reason is purely just the fact that it's fun to play, it's a viable spec.
---
Yeah, please stop posting.
---
Thank you for your service
---
They literally have the an original 1.12 client running internally on the 1.12 infrastructure. Any bug that arises is due to the 7.3 to 1.12 downport conversion. 
---
If someone claims a bug, they will test it on the pure 1.12 client to see if it actually is a bug.
---
This is all known information.
---
I was with you untill that last sentence. Miss me with that robin hood stance shit and give me the male troll sideway gangsta style. This is why trolls are better with bows! ;)
---
I think the point is that since Classic never progresses... he'll eventually get it if he's dedicated.
---
This video has been God knows how many times with the same annoying thumbnail.
---
It’s the beta. They’re working this out in the beta. They’re trying new things in the fucking beta. Layering is here to stay.
---
Mage and warriors. Tanks, portals, food, and water
---
Blizzard hasn't cared about gold sellers in over 4 years and they're purposefully putting in non-Vanilla features to limit the need for GM involvement in Classic at all.
---
The best thing Blizzard can do to prevent back room gold selling in Classic is to introduce the WoW token. They're simply not going to curtail it any other way and when people realize this, the attitude towards WoW tokens will likely change.
---
&gt; the vast majority of Europeans speak English well anyway
---
In which parallel universe would that Europe exist ? I surmise your only exposure to other Europeans is through the prism of English-speaking loci, which obviously selects against anybody who doesn't speak English. It's like thinking everybody on Earth listens to hip-hop because everybody in your circle does.
---
It works, but it's not nearly as effective as on private servers.
---
It's just the stupid idea that EU players have to play on US servers. Of course they don't.
---
Night elf priest.
---
Looks good, can heal or dps, desired in groups, also very sturdy in pvp. Excels at healing in PvE but can also hang out just below the locks/hunters in PvE too.
---
Not leveling as a resto shaman. I had no idea what I was putting myself through...
---
They've made changes. You can stop spamming this shit now.
---
Thinking about doing this...assuming you get the 5 points in life tap, what’s so bad about it?
---
just advertise as a tanking service and make sure youve got at least full pre raid bis and it enchanted so you can mention that in your service advertising. Then when you start collecting tier gear then mention youre full pre raid bis + t1 gear. Anyone who is upset can wait to find a tank which can take a while depending on how old the server is. Also depends on the dungeon, for example strat live is usually just run for the quest run for a lot of classes which include warrior. The same for DM west theres not much for warriors as there is for casters / healers. So basically this is where youll probably find most of your whispers asking you to tank for them. The same sometimes happens for healers , people looking to get ironfoe pay healers to come because theres a much higher demand to try and get an ironfoe compared to how much easier it is for healers on the server to get what they need from a lava run.
---
In few ways will classic be the same as vanilla. Players have hindsight and much more information.
---
There will be plenty of ways to farm gold, and I believe they will be fairly different from vanilla. Although it is likely many players will try the old farming ways, and saturate the servers with such items.
---
There will be newer and better ways to discover
---
It ranges from easy to fucking annoyingly slow.  It is never fast.  It is never fun.
---
"Its just beta guys" line has been the downfall of so many expansions none worse then BFA
---
You won't regret it. Corpse running from the top of STV to the bottom once an hour is a truly uplifting experience.
---
There will likely be a lot of shadow priests, ret pals, and enhance shaman. So druid can ,ok for these specs when going into dungeons. Can't go wrong with mage. They are excellent farmers as alt or main.
---
It's a very very small difference at 60. Probably something like 0.2% dps difference. So 1,000 dps vs 1,002 dps
---
I’m looking for a casual raid guild and am rolling a healer, what faction?
---
1. Don’t listen to min-maxing for races - play what you like looking at.
---
2. Be friendly and share your professions. (Aka - make potions for a warrior when you see them struggling) 
---
3.  Join groups for mob quests - don’t be that one guy spamming your instant damage spell to get the tag on that quest mob.
---
4. Don’t lose your shit over people with no respect.
---
You spend 5 minutes clearing an entire camp of gnolls for that earthroot ? Too bad, the rogue walks in and takes it whilst youre fighting.
---
5. Don’t become the root stealer out of frustration. 
---
Make a macro saying “do you need this herb?” And ask if someone has cleared a mob near it
---
I’ve gotten many sweet and kind messages because of this behaviour.
---
6. If you are grouped with someone - make sure you’re memorable.
---
Give them that second bag you looted - or offer to help finish their quest, even though you’re done with yours.
---
Just be decent - not a pushover - but decent. 
---
Everyone has the right to be frustrated and become the arsehole - just accept it as a boil over - and try to recover.
---
But in the clip they do net him tho?
---
Also, people are getting the "Legion normalization values" thing wrong.  Legion did NOT change the weapon normalization values; they are the same as back then.  What happened by the time of Legion (though I thought it was in WoD or even late Mists) is every single weapon speed was unified to the same one depending on the type of weapon.
---
Somehow, Classic in 2019 took those weapon speeds and replaced the weapon normalization values with them.  This was very likely due to exactly what you are saying because it sure sounds like something akin to misaligned tables to me.
---
is it true that you actually avoid taking damage while still able to attack the mob while hamstring + backpedalling?
---
I just remember it was so much more difficult to level as holy. It took me twice as long to hit 60 compared to anyone else. If you do it. You’ll see lol
---
No, then leeway kicks in and the mob can hit your
---
You enjoyed WoD more than BFA?
---
I really wanna know what that unit frame addon is... specifically, the first staggered raid frames. That looks amazing.
---
Do the priest or shaman first. That way you can dps or heal in pvp on your main. More variety.
---
Do human priest. You’ll look way better in armor.
---
So pick human priest or tauren sham depending on which faction you would rather hang out with more.
---
There you go!
---
jesus mate, are you me? I only just started playing like 3 weeks before the Portals opened.
---
Yeah dude, big excite =D
---
Shaman have a lot more utility. Rogues will make more money with less time played. Shamans easier to get groups playing as. Both great in pvp and bgs.
---
This looks like an old school desync bug with pets tanking mobs.  
---
Auto attack and Yellow Attacks use different systems, and I remember this happening to me at least once, but it was after vanilla iirc.
---
I do plan on going shadow from 40 - 60 so I might have a different experience. Thanks for your perspective though
---
So my understanding is that they are not doing progressive itemization. All items will be in their final 1.12 state but catch up items that were added later won't be added until later.
---
Orcs best pvp race to me.
---
Farmed princess on my hunter
---
There’s clips of it on monkeynews channel, I’m not at my pc rn so I can’t link but that seems to be exactly what happens, mobs get outranged and leeway doesn’t allow them to hit you like it does when you strafe. It looks as crazy as it sounds
---
Thanks for posting this. We've never seen this video before. Maybe next you could make a post titled "How I would fix layering".
---
That would certainly be the smarter idea. I went from 1-60 only holy. It was terrible, but at that point I felt I was too far in to just give up on it haha
---
Yes. Two on same faction will be miles easier. Make an undead mage and orc war alt. Kill your friends and force their faction change.
---
Warlocks can hold their own in pve at later gear levels.
---
Also, in pvp at higher gear they are way more survivable than mages. World pvp gods due to their tankiness and healing.
---
So that should help balance things out and you wont feel as bad if they beat you in pvp in early raids.
---
Plus as a mage you will just be feeding whichever mage has the ignite proc later on. Thats just lame.
---
Typically you respond one time, not 3 times, but maybe I'm behind the curve on the triple response tactics my b
---
&gt;back and fourth until you got mad and tried to make it seem like he was the one getting angry
---
You sadly are mistaken, getting mad would require caring enough to get mad. It's Reddit man, if you care about this you have bigger issues. 
---
I was defending my in game race, putting the horde scum in his place . I was not the one to take it to a personal level. I mean he starts there with his original statement being that anyone playing a gnome is an "idiot" lmao blanket generalizations I've always found extremely comical , how the human brain can rationalize the idea of broad generalizations such as that  in any form. 
---
What I'll finish with is this: any hard feelings had from this are not on my side . I'm not blocking anyone or holding grudges because that's 1. Childish and 2. Unnecessary, as I'm civil and not spewing hate or spamming people's inboxes.. in my opinion blocking someone requires far too much energy to be warranted just for a simple  disagreement or an exchange of words. If they're blowing my notifications up, that's a different story. 
---
Now while you are someone who warrants civil responses and real discussion, I hope you understand that I hope there's not anymore people triple replying and tagging me in comments.
---
Who said you have to. Feel free to stay EU I'm personally going US where they all speak English.
---
5 mans are a prot pally’s niche for sure. I plan on pally tanking 5 mans no problem. People that judge folks for a ‘meme’ spec in 5 man dungeons are just having a bad day. Who cares.
---
Dwarves and pallies are both stout and friendly. Match made in heaven
---
Listen guys both sides of this debate need to chill the fuck out. It's embarrassing.
---
When you can get 2 or 3 big soul shard bags, have one equipped and the other in the bank slot. Fill them both up. On raid night during progression take the second bag with you. Your raid will thank you.
---
Rolling ignites is crazy powerful on alot of fights in AQ40 and Naxx, not just Patchwerk.
---
Go home satan. Your troll powers have no hold here!
---
If you want to heal, you'll like it. Otherwise I would highly recommend rolling a different class. They're very very good healers, but not so good at other roles.
---
You can do Ret in PvP, but even there Holy gets more value.
---
They offer incredibly mana efficient single target healing and the best buffs in the game. 
---
You would roll a Paladin if you want to heal or you want to be very hard to kill. Playing a Paladin is like constantly having 2-3 players with you; no one wants to mess with you or gank you because why bother, it would take too long or you'd just bubble hearth out.
---
[here you go](https://youtu.be/Xlg6BqyaTIQ)
---
Pick priest. You are not overly squishy to the point that class matters all that much. Also, you can go shadow and melt faces while healing him if you want to mix up your approach and be more aggressive.
---
Pally is sweet but your playstyle doesnt have as much variety.
---
It was pre-BC. Kel Thuzad was killed on 06. Jan 2007

Priest. Herb alch
---
Did you notice they never said they had the source code?
---
Even in the blizzcon presentation, they just said they had a code repository that goes back to 1997.
---
They're actually really good dungeon tanks. They don't have a taunt and they have too many mana issues so tanking in raids is a no go fo raids.
---
I'm rolling a personality/friendly lock for PVP
---
Kel Thuzad dropped Paladin Ring. :/
---
&gt; You can even put them to the bank for safety stock.
---
I hadn't thought of that, that's a good point.
---
Jeff Kaplin was literally an eq raider when he did classic and much of WoW is taken from eq.
---
No it was just Pre-BC patch.
---
Issue here is that PvEr can´t control PvPer on PvP server. If someone wants to gank you, they will gank you and it doesn´t matter that you are in the middle of RP event (which often happen outside of the game...basically, you don´t go kill kobolds to that mine in Elwynn, you go kill a warlock who has been hiding there and is represented by another player character or some sort of marker). And you can be sure there will be people ganking RPers.
---
I am all in for RP-PvP servers, but removing RP server in favor of that would pretty much destroy Classic RP for many. Most dedicated roleplayers go for normal RP servers exactly because of ganking and overall lack of control over your environment on RP-PvP server (that´s why normal RP servers ended up as the only surviving ones in Retail). Many of those people who make the world feel alive for others would not bother with RP-PvP server and the situation would reverse itself: RPers would go to PvE server and RP there.
---
We ran Naxx40 in TBC with a 40man raid of lvl70s and it still wasnt "easy" mechanically. The gear-check bosses was super easy though.
---
Im doing the opposite this time around, I realised that in all that time you almost never have an equal level PvP experience, most people wouldn't attack you unless they either outleveled you or outnumbered you so the only thing you get out of it is a whole lot of running back and missing out.
---
I am looking forward to playing PvE for the first time.
---
population kept on growing during all Vanilla and they keep on opening new server and offering transfer. I mean do you think they kept doing that to pretend the game was popular despite all server being ghost town except 2-3?
---
Maybe we should create a new post asking other player how many German player with healthy population there was in Vanilla and BC? I can do that if you tell me that you will a agree to say you were wrong if other people tell you this obvious fact :)
---
We were lvl 60, it was pre-BC patch. (only 4HM, Sapphiron and Kel Thuzad were killed at this patch)
---
Simple keep vanilla servers vanilla and offer others that progress or have new content with free transfers.
---
You haven't heard of it because it's recent. It was theorycrafted by private server players and it has been confirmed to work on the WoW Classic client as well. There are essentially two necessary things, Shadow Oil on your weapon and Dragonfire Chili and you pick up mostly pieces that people don't want that have spell power on them. You use Seal of Righteousness rather than Seal of Command because that is a lot better with a fast weapon. 
---
The reason it works is because of the way things interact with each other. Your talent points are similar to a standard Ret build but the gear is very different. For example, with a fast two hander (though one handers like the Ironfoe are likely really good as well) it has a chance to crit more often because you're attacking more and thus higher Vengeance uptime, you have a higher chance to set off on-hit procs as well. 
---
The way it works is you can use max rank Consecration without going OOM during Vengeance procs and then downrank outside of it. PreBIS gear can do 450 DPS which is very competitive and it continues to do well while taking gear that most people do not want, tier 2 Paladin is practically BIS for example. The damage it can do is below Fury Warriors, Combat Rogues, and the Ignite Mage in your group but otherwise is as good or better than everyone else, though Warlocks may eventually scale past it. Then eventually when you get to Naxx you have one, potentially two new spells to work with in Holy Shock and Exorcism which will help you even more.
---
Only one tank is main tank. He gets all items first. He also gets all consumables from the guild alchemist e h pull. It is a guild effort not a solo effort mon. If you want to be main tank you cannot skip without weeks notice to the guild. Otherwise, you get by just donating g to the pot.
---
We only managed to reach 4 Horsemen last time around before BC was announced and everyone stopped showing up for raids.
---
This time I am gonna get KT.
---
&gt;if you then cared that Undeads would WotF your Fear as a Human Warlock
---
As a human priest I definitely cared. My only defense against a rogue was a fear every 26 seconds and they definitely didn't need 26 seconds to kill me.
---
The racial/faction imbalance for shadow priests was worse than possibly any class, because not only were alliance priests a nightmare due to WotF, but Undead priests were *significantly* stronger due to Devouring Plague.
---
I've seen it all now in terms of prep.  As crazy of a crowd as we are over a game, I love all ya bastards
---
Thanks dad
---
It's almost universally accepted that there will be either:
---
1.  New servers that run TBC, which you can copy your account onto once (to avoid gold duplication).
---
2.  New servers that have new Classic+ content, so that the original Classic Vanilla isn't corrupted by changes.
---
Of course, the problem with 1 is that there would be TBC servers, but then maybe WotLK servers, and Cata servers, and MoP servers.
---
So personally I'd prefer option 2, where we try to maintain Vanilla game philosophies but go in a slightly different direction than the other expansions did, while learning from each of them.
---
I'm maining druid and alt-ing a warlock on Alliance for classic, see it as a challenge if anything :D
---
Getting Deathcharger reins as a Male Gnome Warrior and also gonna try to get prebis dream felstriker+ironfoe

It’s deleted it private now..
---
Fuckin millennials. Amirite?
---
Lol. Ah ice cream
---
I would rather have #2 as well if I had to choose.
---
Yeah, it's actually a really good duel ability because they have run up close to cancel your eating/drinking.
---
yea i think i remember seeing a clip of someone doing on a mob in stv at some point. Im not sure if it was a mob specific thing or something that will be fixed or already is fixed on the beta but that would be kinda silly. I saw a video of someone doing it in the barrens on an old video i think it was tbc. The guy moved in a zig zag patten instead of just straight backwards.
---
Excellent job!
---
I recall it 100% too, but no clue on Beta
---
Interesting. I would def. like to see different story lines with future expansions. Lots of poor decisions in writing could be fixed.
---
Yeah, I can see that you are.
---
Just did a test run on silverhand, fresh server. 1-36 was possible before sleep. It's even possible to get the Bonebiter Axe before I sleep. Ideally i'll pre make a group before launch of people to run SM, Lib, Armory &amp; Cath for it. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=6830](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6830)  
---
After level 40 I plan to take things a lot more relaxed now that i'm ahead of the zerg. Just "Casually" prep for my week 2 rag kill
---
It's Kaplan, not Kaplin, and some guy that took a creative writing job at Blizzard doesn't know anything about marketing, or server stability, or projecting populations. He's a game designer at best, not an engineer. 
---
And Layering is getting fixes and it's a lot better than whatever EQ did, so stop bitching about it.
---
40-man raids. I was in high school so it wasn't an option previously
---
I don't duel Night Elves, I just kill them.
---
Thanks for the info my dudes. I'm definitely gonna be the bloke that always has shards ready then :)

 !remindme 58 days
---
bruiseweed is a low value herb, mostly used for troll blood potions . that imbue chest enchant is bogus, not learnable, it might be a GM thing or a random database error. 
---
put bruiseweed at 2-4g a stack.
---
the poison resist potion is also obsolete because jungle remedy is easily farmed for free in STV  and works better.
---
i don't care for rp-pvp  but i sure as hell know it has its niche, blizzard should put 1 server only and see how its population goes.
---
The thing is i feel like blizzard is operating on a very limited budget due to activision not actually wanting a game like classic.
---
I keep seeing new posts every few weeks about how activision is forcing its cod studios to put more and more monetization in their game, i can't imagine them being okay with a game that will not bring any money beyond the monthly subscriptions. i feel that is one of the major factors why there will be very limited servers, no multi language servers, no rp servers. They will only be able to negotiate higher budget if the amount of subs classic wow brings back exceeds expectations by a large margins several months after launch. only then would they be able to justify adding more servers and thus investing more in infrastructure, maintenance and developers.
---
Only speculations here, but it adds up
---
&gt; not recommended for warriors or otherwise. 
---
So not recommended at all?
---
Supposeed ly rep is reduce 20 percent for each level into grey up to 20 percent as the floor rep value.

Highest quality content

I will be staying up my first 24 + hours as well. I took 10 days off, so I am all set. But I will be getting a jump too.
---
I was determined to play a Druid in classic, (I started in TBC)
---
But entirely my own fault I’ve read and searched way too much to find out that they were pretty mediocre in classic in terms of healing output and their other specs...
---
So now I’m going to play a shaman. I do wish though that I never read anything about Druid’s
---
8 hours of sleep ? filthy casual
---
You can calculate the probability that any of your 4 last casts was a crit.  So if you have 20% crit and 90% hit you have a 0.2 x 0.9 = 18% chance to hit and crit while (1-0.2) x 0.9 = 72% chance of a normal hit (and 10% chance of missing). So the probability of your last shadowbolt being a crit is 18%, multiply that by 4 and you have a 72% chance of your bolt being affected by ISB. 
---
So if we now compare that result with adding either 1% crit or 1% hit we can see which is most valuable for what ISB is concerned. 
---
I'll spare you the calculations but you can check them yourself.    
---
Adding 1% crit gives you a 16.47% buff so a 0.59% increase.    
---
Adding 1% hit gives you a 15.90% buff which is a meagre 0.02% increase.
---
But again it's not a good way of judging your own benefit because it's the other warlocks who get your ISB. So for top personal dps you should probably disregard ISB entirely or at least greatly reduce it's significance. The true value of ISB is quite literally zero if you have 5 or more locks. If you have 4 locks you will get the base crit chance as probability of having ISB up instead four times that. With 3 locks you get 2 times crit chance and so on.
---
Can you explain the ubrs key offer? I don't recall the key thing ;)
---
alright Mr. Internet Janitor.
---
I am having a hard time choosing between these three. Plan to raid through naxx. Don't care much about pvp.
---
Elemental Shaman - Orc (for some bgs)
---
Feral Tank Druid - Either
---
Spell dmg hunter - Dwarf or Troll Leaning Dwarf.
---
Not only the madness. But that moment when you noticably start getting away from it. When you slowly but surely start pulling out from the main pack.
---
Shadowmeld + mind control people off the AB cliff makes them tier 1
---
Could be that, it definitely looks engineeringy.
---
That's how it worked in vanilla. One thing to note though is they're pairing it with Feign Death to drop combat first. Shadowmeld has always canceled casts (it's basically the same function as vanish). However, the out-of-combat limitation in vanilla restricts it's usability to classes which have the ability to quickly drop combat, which basically means only hunters since rogues get vanish already.
---
&gt; the game literally has a built in 4th wall in lore
---
could you explain?
---
Literally neither of them got salty.
---
Why only yellow quests? I'm pretty sure green quests give full rep, right? pls confirm :(
---
Remember that it goes both ways. Give your tank time to get aggro before you start blasting fools
---
There are so many things like this in vanilla where one change would most likely make certain specs viable.
---
Paladins getting taunt, Moonkin Aura being a raid buff instead of a party buff to name a few.
---
Rogues with raid gear
---
Usually when someone starts calling other people "snowflakes" it's a pretty good indicator that they have been triggered.
---
It could be possible, Thrall. Would you want to simply continue repeating the same story and mistakes of the past?
---
What would you have to say about post Naxx 1.13?!
---
That's hilarious
---
&gt; 1.10 (2006-03-28) Damage over time spells are no longer affected by changes in equipment after the cast
---
Looks like that might be where it changed in vanilla which would explain the comment from thottbot in patch 1.9.
---
&gt; in an actual good guild if you’re going to play something that’s obviously worse
---
I'm all for min-maxing, but you're forgetting one CRUCIAL thing. The content in vanilla is CAKE WALK EASY. No one is going to have a problem downing these bosses and I guarantee no one is going to give a fuck if you're a Night Elf Priest or a Dwarf Priest. You can easily make do with just a couple.
---
Is IS actually a big deal for farming this? The fight only takes a few minutes so the total damage it deals has gotta be &lt; 1000.
---
Woah, who said Classic never progresses? 😜
---
I'd actually prefer gold sellers to WoW tokens. #nochanges
---
It's not bad, it just doesn't have fear ward. Is fear ward good? Yes. Do Horde get by just fine without it? Yes. It's not 100% needed, literally play what you want. Vanilla content is veryyyyy easy.
---
Rolling Horde. 
---
Leveling feral. 
---
Making my own guild. 
---
Getting an epic mount. 
---
Not taking shit from anyone, not tagging along with asshole "friends."
---
Raiding, killing Onyxia and Nefarian in particular. 
---
Finishing a Tier set (even if its not BIS)
---
Getting Exalted with Org or Frostwolf to get a Wolf mount. 
---
And the achievement that will literally make me say "I beat the game" - getting the ZG Tiger. I won a roll on it once, but a group member ninja'd it from me (this was TBC, and raid lead didn't give a fuck so had it on free-for-all, we were following an "honor system"). I'll never forget that soul-crushing moment. That will make me whole again.
---
&gt;Why not just use English as you do 99% of the other time when you use the internet.
---
You don't seem to realise the German and French-speaking parts of the Internet are quite substantial. German and French speakers frequenting English-speaking sites are a **minority** of their respective communities.
---
HAHA great art. I love Ed, Edd and Eddy and I love Vanilla WoW.
---
The possibility of having a wow2 or a turn in the design philosophy within blizzard will depend on the commercial success of wow classic.
---
&gt; It’s the beta. They’re working this out in the beta. They’re trying new things in the fucking beta.
---
Okay.
---
&gt;Layering is here to stay.
---
??? What was all that shit about "beta" about then?
---
It's not mandatory but it does kill her quite a bit faster.
---
Levelling is the true rite of passage and you can do that with any class.
---
So I'm just gonna dive in deep with Warlock and DO IT :D
---
Quick, kill the beast while he is wounded!
---
I’m sorry but emerald dream shouldn’t be it’s own continent or expansion. It’s too much of a stretch. 
---
I like how retail made it a raid. Could definitely expand upon that a bit, but not too much
---
Making it that much more difficult to play with your friends on other layers.
---
Babies, bathwater...
---
Play past level 20, I was 8 when the game came out and couldn't figure out where to go after the deadmines
---
I know... I honestly might continue the 18 Up 6 Down instead until i'm mentally drained
---
Glad it was useful!
---
Paladin, no contest. Your cleanses, hands, and heals will basically break the game and stack the odds in your group’s favor. Also blessings are insane as far as buffs go.
---
I have true fun playing a Tauren Druid. I may not be top of any chart but I like the healing and I like the cat form. Helps me get along in most situations. I try not to give a damn about everybody who says that I should play a Shaman if I want to play heal/support on Horde side etc.
---
Nobody cares dude.
---
I miss being a NEET
---
Time travel isn’t canon. They used the chronic thing for fun. It’s not like we’re going into the past to play Vanilla lol
---
Pandaria and Pandas are like the cow level in Diablo. A joke.
---
Nah. Not knowing which buyers are legitimate, not knowing which buyers know how to avoid detection, not letting the realm set the value of gold, and Tokens can only be used for Blizzard balance, meaning Classic players will only buy so many before they're worthless. Chinese gold sellers are inferior to WoW tokens in every way.
---
This is 100% me. My reddit account was named after my first character. You can see how creative I was
---
A joke right?
---
Honestly. Pandas could be a zone. Or a neutral faction similar to goblins, but with less population and stuffs
---
The release trailer for WoW Classic has time travel. That's canon.
---

---
I am having a hard time trying to figure out what to roll in classic, so I was wondering if people might know/remember which classes stuck out in tbc?
---
I feel like tbc classic is a likely possibility, so this seems like another possible avenue to help me narrow down my choices. Unfortunately my memory is quite bad, so I can't remember which classes stuck out. Sucks to get old. I remember Rdruids being stupidly broken in pvp, and that's about it.
---
Usually, when I throw the word "snowflake", its to try to get the other person tiggered.
---
It's unlikely but I wish Blizzard would crack down harder on gold sellers this time or put in more systems in place to track it. Buying gold defeats the purpose of the all players on equal footing, no p2w. And gold is so valuable in Vanilla
---
&gt; The cutscenes and plot are absolutely tremendous.
---
Ah yes, no higher honor for an RTS than praising its cutscenes and plot.
---
Thank you dude, I'm already glad some people might use it! Maybe it's not this sub only, it's only a reflection of our society that tends to resort to quick and efficent, when necessary. This was a good experiment, there is always room to improve!
---
40-50 takes longer than 50-60 in my experience
---
Thanks, that info will come in handy.
---
If it procs on aoe, it might be busted.
---
There's only so much to spend gold on in Classic.
---
You're gonna LOVE classic chat.
---
Downvoted for upvoting "positive attitude" rather than valuable content.
---
Not sure who's the biggest idiot, you or him.
---
Weird, quirky pieces of loot to play around with and build around is a big part of why Vanilla WoW was so incredibly good.
---
Get it high enough to do arcanite transmutes
---
I miss vanilla /2. It's just going to be a lot different dealing with the teenage edge lords since I'm not one anymore.
---
All of this is irrelevant, because we know what is best *now*, and Classic releases in the *now* rather than *then*.
---
There's no vendor for any level that sells infinite green items. And the green items sold by a vendor are almost never disenchantable.
---
If the stress test was anything to go off of. Its still going to be politics, religion, and a mix of "fuck retail" and "fuck blizzard".
---
There's a lot you can spend gold on in classic. Level 40 and Level 60 mount and riding, lots of pre-raid BiS is bind on equip, leveling up professions and getting rare recipes like Flask of the Titans, consumables for raiding, mats for high level crafted items, consumables for PvP (like Free Action Potion and Thorium Grenades), respeccing.
---
The highest vendor green item is level 44 and they're almost always either too expensive to make worth it or completely not disenchantable.
---
Not before he edited it.
---
Nice
---
YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT STOP ENJOYING VIDEO GAMES REEEEE
---
I’m playing a human Paladin. This is purely a cosmetic choice one of my favorite characters I ever made was a human ret Paladin. I know I will probably be a healer in raids, but I love the class fantasy of the and will more than likely be building a sort of shockadin, then spec into ret to get seal of command. This is by no means an optimal play style to raid with but I want to be able to fight in pvp (gonna be on a pvp server). The whole build sounds fun to me and that’s why I’m playing that way. If you wanna be a warlock be a warlock. You’ll enjoy the game more playing what is fun to you in my opinion.
---
Second wind trinket off of golem? In BRD. it gives 300 mana over 10 seconds on use
---
Oof, some good Points there.
---
I dont really wanna do achievements like they are in retail now where you get credit for random stuff.
---
I just wanna "complete" classic in every aspect that makes kinda sense. Also I just wanna stick to one character, maybe an alt later but only to do some random stuff, nothing serious ... simply because of the reason, that leveling takes really Long.
---
Since im limited by that, I wont go for 60 on every class (that would be something if u wanna stay on classic for ever I guess ... but I kinda want TBC/WotLk afterwards &lt;.&lt;). The Point with professions ... well if a character would remember recipes from a Abandon Profession, like the spell ranks from talents ... then yes. But like now, prolly passing. Maybe on alts!
---
The STV / Gurubashi wins is a good Point, will add that!
---
The other stuff is like I mentioned ... some random stuff inbetween that dont really has something to do with "completing" classic.
---
Sidenote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFknXl80rOk
---
My Server back then - although we were mostly ganking and fooling around after some time lol.
---
There's no question there? Nobody asked that.
---
Plus, rezzing the healer with your cables. Loved those moments.
---
I'm going to join a guild that doesn't award it's first thunderfury to a hunter and I'll get both halves this time.
---
a true warlock
---
Thanks, gonna Keep that in mind for classic!
---
Negative Nesingwary.. Mentions all class except hunters.
---
Coincidence? I think not.
---
If the rest of the alliance won't go Warlock because of Will of the Forsaken, then that just means more warlock gear for you in raids. There's a very good survey with some nice filters about what people want to play. For horde on PvP servers warlocks are usually tied with mages in popularity, but are much less popular on Alliance.
---
Also
---
1. Every raid has 1 shadow priest as Shadow weaving buffs warlock damage.
---
2. Warriors scale the hardest with gear and top the meters in the second half of classic.
---
3. Paladins are THE most mana efficient healers, and amazing pvp healers. and they can off-tank well especially AoE tank.
---
4. Dwarf priests stop being BiS after BWL, Nefarian is the last raid boss with fear.
---
5. The horde PvE raids just fine without the superior allaince racials, or Pally buffs.
---
that is not how research / science works. the information beforehand is VERY useful.
---
As much as we can hope for a WoW2, it probably won't ever come. The cost of creating a new MMO from the ground up is sky high and current market is a lot less MMO friendly these days. People don't want to invest that much time in a single game anymore and feel like they should earn rewards ingame for basicly mediocre tasks.  
---
A WoW2 wouldn't work in the end, will never get as much popularity as WoW did in its primetime when the gaming community was hot on MMO's and every few months there was a new one to play. The old Blizzard might have been able to make it a success anyhow, but with the meddling of Activision they'll never dedicate that much time &amp; resources into it.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'm starting up a guild (anyone is welcome to join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/pedjhk3)) with some friends and will be tanking up to about 60 in groups then swapping over to fury. Really excited!
---
One of the truisms of tabletop gaming: nobody ever tells stories about that time everything went according to plan.
---
I'm just happy that, for once, my wonky schedule actually works in my favor. I work weekend 12s, Sat-Mon. I'm going to take a half day on the 26th and be ready for the launch then have four days off afterward without spending any PTO.
---
I am so excited for all the wacky launch hijinks. 8/26 can't get here soon enough.
---
I really want to play wc3 but I'm waiting for reforged since it's a reimagined retelling and not just a graphics update. Such a shame it won't be out till after Classic. Guess I won't be playing Reforged for a few years. :P
---
That's pretty good.
---
Feign Death shadowmeld won me some precious duels as a hunter, buying a few seconds for cooldowns as the kited target wades over into detection range.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c62feo/achievements_in_classic/
---
Thats my list
---
Feedback was actually useful in caster fights and perception helped you fear the rogue before they got an opener.  Human wasn't a bad choice for pvp.  Desperate Prayer was also a nice racial spell.  I never felt like a weak pvp priest for going human.
---
Layering is game design not engineering.
---
Also I'm not bitching, I'm giving suggestions, the solution EQ implemented was really good.
---
Ret paladins were really sick PvP-wise in TBC (tanky, solid DPS) and did okayish damage also in Raids with Windfury. Still worse DPS than other melees in general, but they brought a lot to the table 2% Crit debuff, cleanse, off-heal, off-tank and so on. Don't know how many times I served as a fail-save to my raid guild in TBC. In vanilla it is a different story until Naxx (what I got from hearsay) were they can close the dps gap a little due to holy wrath and exorcism. But they were still quite useful in PvP (Repenetance) and were able to burst people down with some RNG Luck. People give them too much crap and that was the real problem with the class back in the day. You heard the class was shit or you witnessed some shit ret players and the conclusion was Ret suck no matter what. When my guild decided to disband in TBC I quit a month later, when I realised the hostility torwards the class.
---
They don't fulfill the same role. Warrior is burst and healing debuff. Ret paladin is burst and support. Warrior requires support to function, ret paladin does not.
---
And if nobody ever takes a ret paladin in a premade pvp group the two ret paladin grand marshals on my server back in vanilla were just warriors, where the red bar bugged into a blue bar?
---
Besides, the argument here is about 1v1, not premade groups. Rets aren't optimal there, but they aren't garbage. You just run into trouble, when you plan to use them exactly like a warrior. A ret paladin is not a weaker version of a warrior, it's different class. Just because, they also have the trait of melee burst damage doesn't make them the same.
---
Please get off the bandwagon of "Unless you take everything 100% optimal, it's garbage".
---
Meh. 90g for level 40 mount, 800g for epic mount, no one really needs pre-BIS, there's only a handful of rare BoE recipes that matter, high level crafted items are pretty garbage and useless once you get into raids.
---
But yeah, buying gold prevents you from having to do shitty things in the game so you can just do what you want. But that's really no different from not needing to work and being able to play all the time, just one is healthier.
---
I'll probably buy around 10,000g over the course of the game. That'll be plenty.
---
This seems like a bad idea.
---
The thing Canadians hate most is other Canadians.
---
Beastial Rage (I think that was the name.) from a stealth cat with a shadowmelded hunter was unfair.  ;)
---
Same I remember this being a useful trick for using up spare points before moving on to a new mob while questing. Hope it's still around.
---
Layering is not the same as writing quests and designing PvE zones, which is what Kaplan did. It's a much bigger decision than he would ever be allowed to touch.
---
&gt;  I'm giving suggestions
---
Blizzard doesn't need them and we don't want them.
---
&gt;  the solution EQ implemented was really good.
---
No it wasn't.
---
well, the more you know.
---
Haha :D What about when the Druid specs resto though? :D
---
You are insufferable person.
---
Layering is not engineering, it's game design. You don't know waht you're talking about and are blocked.
---
You're also just the worst.
---
The more zones you have, the more you spread the player base.
---
Or being able to book leave
---
I'm 27 and I've never seen WC3 called "TFT"

Cool story bro.
---
I didnt have to play the game in WoD the game did it for me so atleast i could just raid log
---
We already recruited a Druid that never wanted to be Balance and raids only ever want one Resto Druid, so he'll have to find a new home that doesn't remember he was once no better than a meme.
---
Bunch of nakeds standing around, in total silence....
---
&gt; ret pallys are so easy to kite and break combat with why wouldn't you do it?
---
Pray tell, how you plan on kiting a ret paladin as a warrior. You literally cannot go faster than him ever. 
---
&gt; You just go oom trying to heal thru MS and interrupt.
---
A ret paladin, who tries to heal with MS on them is a pretty bad ret paladin.
---
Have you seen people on the beta doing this?
---
If you have, how does this work with the lock out? Does every relog count as entering a dungeon? And does the max 5 dungeons/hour work as intended?
---
T'as essayé de faire un perso sur un serveur français sur BFA pour voir le ping ? Normalement du Québec à la France le ping ne devrait pas être très élevés. J'ai joué occasionnellement avec des QC depuis 2005 (parce qu'ils raidaient la nuit et qu'ils étaient marrant :)) et je ne crois pas que ça les dérangeasse plus que ça.

Omg that needs To be removed entirely
---
Hey,
---
I recently got a comment on a different post about Blizzard relocating the NPC and item names to what it was back in the days. So basically Ironforge will still be named Ironforge, stormpike clan will still be using this name etc. 
---
Might not mean much to what you're saying, but just for information.
---
About the nostalgia of playing with german only people (I'm french but I can relate), I think it's no big deal IF everyone is willing to speak the same language. unfortunately you know as much as me that French people or other communities are only going to speak their language, thus making it a nightmare for other countries and cleaving the communities. And that will not be "as it was" in Vanilla :-/ That is my most concern about this choice.
---
Blizzard already knows the language you set Battle.net or your client to...
---
&gt; the reality is that the reputation gains on the beta are about half of what they'd been reported as.
---
Yeah. I've been saying that for some time now; Reaching Exalted on private servers is a truckload easier than I remember it having been during Vanilla, and I mean *after* the the reputation patch that fixed rep amounts for low level quests.
---
PvP Vendors would fit the description. But I assume your intent is disenchanting? Then I'm afraid that all their goods are unenchantable.
---
Quickest way to get shards or other dusts is usually leatherworking/tailoring or just running instances with loads of bosses. Scholomance and BRD come to mind here.
---
This is getting sad.. scheduling ur sleep to play a video game
---
Apparently level 10-16 Horde, since the one time I ended up in the Barrens as a Nelf (accidentally) I walked all the way across it stealthed
---
said Sylvanas
---
For pvp yes, for pve? Lol no dude dont kid yourself. Its not like rotations in classic is hard, and tactis can be learned. A boomkin will forever suck.
---
Nah, quickest way is to buy gold and ransack the auction house.
---
Whilst technically true, as the vestments are BoP then you do need tailoring to wear it.
---

---
It also gave us elves in the Horde. And tentacle-mutant sci-fi space goats. And daily quests. And flying. And elves in the Horde. And a greater focus on endgame content over world content. And an expansion model that made said world obsolete overnight. And furthered the idea the only problem with raiding was inaccessibility rather than the fact the activity itself simply doesn't appeal to a substantial proportion of the player base. And cussing *elves* in the cussing *Horde.*
---
Combo points took a second to fade from the target, so you could get off a quick SnD
---
A paladin can do anything for sixty levels.  They get shoe horned for raids.
---
Norhings good for this crowd
---
Arenas: resto druids, warriors, rogues, warlocks. Also priests and mages for rmp and any 2s combo made from it.
---
Raids: warlock lol
---
I think the amount of people that watch the subreddit and forums is not enough to make a proper guess, its minor to say the least in comparison on how many people will play the game.
---
The knowledge has been spread mostly already by private servers, so I wouldn't say stuff like this has a major impact.
---
In a world where youtubers and streamers can spread information like wildfire, there's not much for self exploration anymore if people take the time to watch it.
---
Potentially easier to hide behind a bush in PvP though
---
&gt; to play a video game
---
I don't understand. What do you mean "a video game"? We're talking about classic wow here.
---
/s
---
Doesn't have improved blizzard though, sadly.
---
If I can slow it, I can kill it.
---
If youre charging for say a UBRS run you better be decked in BWL BiS at the very least so we can speedrun that place, if your gear is even close to the same as the rest of the group and you try to charge you'll be told to gtfo
---
Playing alliance and rolling on a RP server
---
But you dont have the fly for orgrimmar if you never visited, right?
---
Imagine writing that shit on someone's posts, because you once got mad at the guy. Lmao.
---
Here's another thread about hamstring kiting. Here's my answer to it. Has a little bit in there about leveling / spec as well. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5p6wj/warrior\_leveling\_without\_hamstring\_and\_sit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5p6wj/warrior_leveling_without_hamstring_and_sit/) 
---
So I main a warrior and have been leveling one in the beta now testing everything out.
---
1. Hamstring kiting - This is still extremely viable if you have a swing timer. With the mob leeway and spell batching, and different movement from pservers that most are use to it is a bit of a learning curve. You have to figure out hit boxes, timing, and how to use your camera angles to actually be facing your target when you run back in.
---
2. Specs - I personally go full arms until 40. I don't bother with getting the 5% crit. For a couple reasons. The first being that at 30 sweeping strikes is worth WAY more to you than 5% crit. The second being I want to keep my respecs at a minimum and don't want to waste my low costing respec at 30 and then another one at 40. Saves money for mounts.
---
Also 2H fury will NOT work the way people use it on private servers because the /sit macro DOES NOT work. Again going back to my full arms build until 40 because 5% crit isn't going to make your life a TON easier.
---
Bottom line - Arms is the cost effective way to go. You may knock out a LITTLE leveling time from 10-20 with the 5% crit in fury but its not worth wasting a low cost respec. After 20 that 5% crit is still awesome, but it wont make that much of a difference.
---
Hopefully this clears some things up for you. On my phone typing this up at lunch lol.
---
It's the Scourge Invasion event.  Small necropolis' like this would spawn over different zones and skeletons and banshees would appear roaming around below them.  You had to kill a ton and gathered like crystals or something that you could turn in for rep rewards with AD.  Thats where the Argent Dawn tabard from the Scourge Invasion Feat of Strength comes from in fact.
---
&gt;  (This guide focuses on solo gameplay, so no group stuff or alt invites etc.)
---
Like I said in my guide, if you'd take the time to look, I know about the ways to do this, since people have been spreading it, also this method was revealed in the guide I posted in the link at the top, which was private server biased.
---
to avoid further confusion and 1000 replys on the gold values being off maybe its best if you simply just edit the gold prices out and let people explore the market themselfs.
---
simply knowing what items are good for is good enough in this guide
---
Duvel/Rayko
---
I don't see any scheduled potty breaks.
---
Can't express how off I expect a lot of these herbs to be.
---
Wow. You weren't kidding.
---
&gt; running the same raid 250 times for years
---
Or people will just stop playing because WoW is not the only good game out there.
---
Or, all the current servers will be pushed to TBC and one new Vanilla-only server will open up allowing transfers to it.
---
Step into Molten Core with 40 other raiders.
---
oh well dont bother then.
---
i didnt know that you would speedlevel \^\^
---
good luck
---
Not entirely true; you seem to imply that the damage component of auto attacks from SoR cannot proc effects, did I read that correctly? The damage component of SoR used to proc effects individually, so each attack with SoR used to enables procs twice: once from the auto attack and once from the holy damage component. If this is not in the beta its a bug, just look at this patch note:
---
[Patch 2.1.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.1.0) (2007-05-22): This seal will no longer cause additional chances for weapon procs to trigger. 
---
This was patched *out* of TBC, meaning that its Vanilla behaviour.
---
&gt; But again it's not a good way of judging your own benefit because it's the other warlocks who get your ISB.
---
If you are class lead you can tell your locks to ALL focus crit, so the entire lock group benefits.
---
Thank you for the post by the way, I enjoyed the way you approached the calculations, and simplifying it all.
---
There can't be "less layering on cities". Layering is not sharding. It's the entire continent to avoid phasing while travelling, so if there's layers, it includes everything.
---
Lol, you are posting a guide and the second someone give some criticism you get super defensive...
---
Yeah, that's why I actually prefer it. You should have to farm or play the auction house to get your gold. You should have to run the risk to break the game.
---
Just gotta make sure you're on the winning side! The Australian Defence Force won't engage a position unless the numbers are 3:1 in our favour - just need to apply the same thing to STV. 😜
---
Not if it was not in Vanilla like that. We're not looking for equality, we're looking for a proper recreation of Vanilla.
---
tanking takes some experience and good Timing, but the Rotation is as simple
---
omg 🤣🤣 I wish they'd allow username changes.
---
The Stress Test was purposefully meant to do weird stuff to Layering and they've already made changes to the system since.
---
I know Its a meme - but to be correct it should be a Mage or hunter thats pulling while the Tank waits for the healer.
---
Actually, private servers had removed greens and gems and other goodies from the pickpocket boxes loot table, the rogue's diary is not the main source of income from pick pocket.
---
Sell my arcanite cooldown and any excess herbs, and make potions. Should at least cover repairs while saving slowly for the epic mount.
---
It's only a risk for the middle class, not the wealthy, which just makes it worse, not better.
---
Hey just FYI, it's only a minor inaccuracy but I wanted to point it out. To make up for the human bonus you can't just do -10%, that way you're taking away too much. 10800\*1.1 = 11880 or 20 rep short. The correct number would be 12000/1.1 = 10909.09 (rather than 12000\*0.9)
---
It did that in Vanilla, look at these patch notes:
---
In TBC they patched it out, meaning it was working in Vanilla.
---
Yeah we need to know so we don’t roll on the same server
---
&gt; These are the key places early game, Its not a lot but I wont list everything (Some Self-Exploring required, yay!)
---
Like I said in the guide, I encourage some self-exploring and I dont list everything, maybe you missed that part.
---
Mages and Huntards actually didn't pull all that much in Vanilla. I know it happened every now and then but that shit would end up getting you kicked from a raid. 
---
Now it's just "TANK HURRY PULL TANK TANK TANK TANK PULL HURRY PULL TANK TANK PULL"
---
The Emerald Dream is too big for any kind of expansion. The Emerald Dream is basically all of the zones put together. There's either gonna be a lot of empty space, or it'll be bigger than almost every expansion.
---
If that's true you're doing something very wrong.
---
Ive played throughout tbc on duelist/gladiator levels and remember rets being absolute thrash every season:(
---
 Ive played enhancement shaman (second worst) so I would usually tell myself that at least rets are worse then my spec and feel cheerful.
---
Ive played on 2.4.3 arena tournament private servers afterwards and the only comp which could somehow work with ret was ret/restokin druid in 2v2. But even that comp was worse then any other spec paired with a restokin druid... And lets not talk about 3v3...
---
So, you Im a bit confused about your comment (rets became op for a few weeks in 3.0 wotlk prepatch but thats not really tbc).
---
I'm not him but I was a shaman who raided as a healer and pvp'd as ele + healing by the end of vanilla. I had a blast being useful in pve and being overpowered in world pvp etc. So much utility. 
---
Now I want to tank harder and pvp harder. So a warrior and a hunter/rogue are on the menu when I no life classic.
---
I was 9 when I first got vanilla WoW and I had rolled a Tauren. I felt so at home strolling around Mulgore, admiring the Kodo (very disappointed I couldn't tame one), killing harpies, and falling off that damn lift. This is almost exactly the first picture that pops into my head when people start talking about vanilla.
---
I'm just afraid Activision will go all EA and release it as a free to play/pay to win mobile game, like Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals. That would be devastating.
---
This could have been 'corrected' with modern technology
---
If BM: orc because of increased pet damage. Also, the gear looks awesome on an orc female and they don’t get to wear tongs throughout the entire journey 😉
---
Thanks for your comments here, exactly the kind of information I needed!
---
Gotta agree with banned on this one. For PvP meld is extremely powerful when used correctly. Go watch some of Traques PvP videos
---
Depends on the item, if I'm getting someone to do my enchant crusader and there's only two on my faction with it, I'm gonna tip more, if I'm looking for one generic trainer item for a quest then I ain't gonna tip so much, but it all comes down to server economy. Early on tips will be less because people have less.
---
thats the issue with petition's people don't like signing them.
---
Or you could just go to bed when you get tired like a normal person.
---
STV and Arathi Highlands were always something to approach with caution. Open world PVP meant you always had to be ready to go.  I don't recall being scared until setting foot into BWL. The time cap on the first boss made it a real pain in the ass. Later on, Blackrock Mountain was a pretty popular for open world pvp. 
---
I remember loving Uldaman and facing down the final boss, although many of the classic dungeons were really cool. Blackfathom Depths was a nice mix of an underwater dungeon and a full clear of Sunken Temple took a while if you were level appropriate.
---
Ahhh cool :) thank you for the reply, I appreciate it dude :)
---
Really? Got any source for that? I was watching summ1ts stream when he did pick pocket runs in RFD on the beta, I think he did 3 or 4 runs and all he got from the lockboxes was basically rogue reagents and grey items that didn't vendor for much.
---
&gt; English is the western world's 'common'.
---
French is France's common.
---
I've lived in touristy areas, and I'm always happy to help visitors around who need help. I've even guided some tourists around local monuments just for the fun of it. I must have dealt with over a dozen nationalities and few languages.
---
But it's incredibly rude to just assume people speak English (or any foreign language for that matter). I'd be far less inclined to help these people out.
---
&gt;That's not the only way to go about traveling though.
---
It seems the way of travelling you prefer is theme park tourism, where the country only exists as a backdrop to your experience and your selfies. I wouldn't be saddened if that form of consumption could be thoroughly eradicated.
---
You don't even need to build a set around a piece of gear I know I kept a Phantom Blade on my Prot warrior well into the T2 / 2.5 phase of his lifespan simply to disuade rogues from harassing me while I farmed. 
---
Nothing gets a rogue to leave you alone as fast as being killed multiple times by a prot warrior who could stance dance intercept stun with a phantom blade so they could never stealth to try and open up on you a second or even third time.
---
I never wore cloth in vanilla, and was a regular in my raid group. Usually as main tank healer. ZG/MC/AQ20/BWL.
---
Just raiding in general. Doing MC, Ony and BWL when they release, not walking through them like an amusement park as a 80-90.
---
The perfect dream? Tanking the Twin Emps with a Warlock.
---
The impossible dream? Warlock takes Atiesh too.
---
Judging by the comments of people who actually played beta, and from various streamers/youtubers, dungeon grinding with a good group seems to be very fast.
---
Try to do DM hyenas on lock lol
---
Then you weren't at your best.
---
Called flight paths
---
Yeah the challenge isn't in the skill use
---
This is basically what we plan to do. 2-3 mages, 0-1 warlock, a prot warr and a priest
---
I told myself that then had 25 shards going into scholomance and used them all before half way. Farming them is probably a lot quicker than you think but they can also run out very very very very fast. How many people are you summoning and giving healthstones to? You couldnt fill an account of alts full to the bank with full max soul shard bags if you give healthstones to everyone in a raid constantly alone, and you are only one character with a backpack and 4 bags, and you need space for other things. You will at some point run out of soul shards, and some asshole who played warlock and at multiple times didn't constantly have soul shards will tell you how you should always have soul shards.
---
As a rogue, I never jumped prot warriors. It just wasn't worth it. Without restealths it would be basically impossible.
---
I never want to meme to die!
---
Could I please request for someone to make one of these for every class? :)
---
just a little correction: nihilum got the world first kt kill ;) 
---
and while u are correct about vanilla, minmaxing really started in tbc. paladin buff b\*tches outside of raid entrances really was a thing almost every server first guild did.
---
I played a MT in Classic, through to Wrath. The fact is, Warriors were a dime a dozen. If your a dick, in a PUG, there's going to be someone else that's not. Honestly, the most in demand class for dungeons was a priest. That said, if your up front that your looking for X piece of loot, it shoulder be too hard. Better yet, form your group yourself out of people you meet along the way. Build up that /friends list. Lock in a healer first and then strategically select classes that won't compete for the same gear as you.
---
Anyone tested the RFD run on beta? I read some where that the price on Rogues Diary was a lot lower than on private servers?
---
Took a break from this subreddit. Nice to see that "PLS CHANGES" 30 times a day, is still going. And to think that most of the "newcomers" will be people like this. If blizzard says yes to these people they will get more money, at least in the short term. If they say no, these people will quit in less than 6 months.
---
Activision saying no to money? And then people wonder why so many people are skeptical about this project's future.
---
"Add this, change that, what about after Naxx". Make no mistake, you never wanted vanilla, you want an abomination.
---
the way dungeon loot works there often no reason for a tank to go where you want to go - unless they are guildies and just want to help out I suppose
---
Roll paladin if you enjoy the supporting role, but understand that that is what the class is about: support. You make other people the heroes by keeping them alive, cleansed and buffed.  
---
I enjoy it immensely, but it's not for everyone. You will be an unsung hero, but people who understand the game will love you for it.
---
If you want to be the star of the show, you should probably roll another class.
---
Easy, Simply make it so the Warlock debuffs are on a seperate system that combines the Dots into one debuff of each type on the mob. That way the limit is preserved, and AFF warlocks can now add their full damage irrespective of the rest of the raid group.
---
\*Bestial Wrath. 
---
And yes, such a painful experience being soloed by the pet alone :)
---
joining the would like ping when picture is available group :)
---
Pretty sure hunter pets only despawn when the owner's settings no longer draw it.
---
And no, NPC's don't have leeway.
---
Layering is in the game, they've made several changes to it to prevent abuse and will continue making changes to it as they see fit. Time to get over it.
---
Leeway is Vanilla-like. Same as above.
---
Dying sucked, but the main thing I like about pvp realms is the constant feeling of danger. It fucking sucks to die when the spirit healer is a 5 minute walk away, but knowing that makes you so cautious and on the edge of your seat.
---
If your a MT for a guild, they should be helping offset your repair and respect / flask costs. 
---
What we did was sell the BoE wrists and belts from MC after our main's had the T1 sets and use that to fund repairs. Later on as a bunch of gear would rot, we would open up spots for loot rights for X amount of gold.
---
Seems an odd sleep schedule, why are you sleeping in the middle of the day?
---
Legion actually launched 15 minutes early.
---
I remember at like, 11:45 parking myself in Dalaran and the quest popping up 15 minutes ahead of schedule.
---
Combo points fade instantly on beta. Not possible to use SnD.
---
Dota is a fickle beast. Many aspects of the game are so unintuitive and poorly explained that it can be a frustrating experience when first learning it... However this makes it more enjoyable when you actually start learning the intricacies of the game!
---
make the triangle, fully extend your arms, look at an object through the triangle, close your eyes one at a time, whichever eye can still see the object is the dominant eye.
---
So much less now I'm married with two kids :(
---
I dont mind paying tanks for runs if they are good. 
---
That being said, if you are slow or a poorly geared or just generally suck at tank then im probs not going to run with you again and probs /ignore you. Nor will i be paying if im healing.
---
Reserving items are fine aswell. Just be upfront about it. 
---
I dont mind how you are if im not paying. Its the matter that i have payed for a tanking service you should be geared and know how to tank efficiently.
---
tauren bis 12 yard ranged melee hunter
---
I just port/hearth out if they try to be decietful.
---
This is the test I know as well. Distance doesn't really matter, worked on this text box sitting a normal distance from the monitor. Fun fact, my eye dominance shifted about 3 years ago, used to be left eye dominant and now I'm right.
---
If you're not tanking raids there's no need to get improved shield block. Its purpose is primarily to make you immune to critical strikes and crushing blows versus a single mob. In a dungeon you'll be tanking multiple mobs most of the time, so they'll chew through the shield block buff in a fraction of it's duration. 
---
If you're dead set on 31/5/15, I'd get anticipation, toughness, last stand, and defiance. Don't get me wrong, improved revenge is great. I'll probably be getting it if I use a 31 point prot build. But being next to defiance, there's no room for it with only 15 points to go around.
---
cus he can? lul
---
Sorry if this one seems all over the place.
---
Most rogues typically knew to steer clear of me, my gear being a large visual deterant but the fact I farmed Thorium and Dark Iron in Burning Steppe and was a well known person on the server at the time alot of wouldbe gankers still tried their luck just to post about it on the realm forums to brag that they killed me.
---
Having a few added trick's and abilities aside from simply a deep well of health and armor was a smart thing to have since I was mining so close to the Alliance capitals.
---
3. The don't do either.
---
I raided Naxx in classic. Spell hunter is going to be a low man on the totem pole for a DPS spot. Same with Feral Tanks. Elemental Shamans wern't super popular for spots either. By the time guilds got to Naxx, one of the big hangups was having 6 tanks for 4H. Priests were always in demand along with Resto druids. Mages and Rogues were typically chart toppers for DPS. Play what you want, but understand that guilds who ran Naxx successfully were very particular in who got what slots. There wasn't alot of wiggle room for anything but the most ideal specs for DPS/Healing/Tanking ect.
---
You mean spirit tap. And you definitely want to get wand spec as soon as possible as well. If you can get a wand early on (tailoring/enchanting?), I'd even say get wand spec first.
---
I leveled disc/holy as well, but shadow is faster and you can still heal dungeons in shadow spec, just with less leeway. Both works though.
---
Hey I'm on there.. damn I have been playing since Sunday and I'm only level 17 lol
---
Thank you for you reply ! Does that make Wartank/Mage bad choices for me ? If yes, why ?
---
They are pretty ok tanks in dungeons, a decent paladin player will manage tanking all dungeon instances in vanilla. 
---
For raiding, I found the main problem to be the lack of good tanking gear for paladins. There's a blue set (Deathbone) that you can wear at lvl 56 that you can pick up in Scholomance, but in general there are very few pieces of gear that provides enough damage mitigation. 
---
Defense is incredibly important for tanking raids in vanilla. Having too low defense means you will struggle a lot when being the subject of critical hits from bosses. Sadly, paladin gear tends to lack defense, and wearing warrior gear means you will struggle with mana (which is crucial to build threat).
---
The armor set: [https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=124](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=124)
---
u/lil_deep phahahahhaa btw az niskiq s duskata li trq da sum ? :D
---
It's really a shame pre-1.4 mounts won't be in the game.
---
Going to stream? Should record it for history and future generations.
---
Yeah I can sort of see the reasoning.
---
There would have been nothing wrong with Gorehowl stuck in a rock tho. 
---
Also, damn you might be right. I changed the hue in photoshop and the image looks like Northrend now.
---
https://i.imgur.com/p5zrBhT.jpg
---
It looks better to me this way, but the sand/ash does fit a warrior better.
---
Lionheart Helm is BiS.
---
You can pull with the healer oom as a paladin, you wont die since mobs won't be attacking you anyways
---
I'm looking forward playing in group yes, we're gathering friends and friends of friends to make a guild big enough to be a bit sustainable. And even with 20+ people interested, no one wants to play tank...   
---
I'm sold on the Warlock now thanks to you and Cerva. What about Mage ? Is it a bad choice ?
---
I would suggest having half and half of RP and RP PvP. If they are gonna have 2 RP servers. Why not 1 RP-PvP and one RP?
---
Preach.
---
Give me a few runes and ill port for free.
---
We had like 3 warlocks in our guild, and we never really had issues. Just refill in the raid.
---
I would burn every World Tree, women and children all, if my queen asked it of me. It’s about time the Horde got some balls. That’s three Alliance cities the Horde has conquered. We’re coming for you Dwarves.
---
I really didn't get that. Sure, there was danger, but it just felt as satisfying as playing on a computer that bluescreens at random intervals.
---
Fiery blaze "enchant" hits all nearby enemies for about 15-25 damage when it procs.
---
Warlock is mid-right, in your order. Mid left is shaman. You are right on rogue and hunter. Bottom mid paladin, bottom right mage, top left warrior, and I believe middle druid because of cat and top right priest, but why does priest have Darnassus and Aldrassil rather than druid? The druids literally made those places!
---
&gt; Making it that much more difficult to play with your friends on other layers.
---
Not sure if trolling, but do you really need to play with *many different* friends, swapping group more often than *once a few minutes*?
---
Sorry, but you couldn't be more wrong. You're free to do whatever you want, of course. But so are good tanks. And they can try to charge for runs.
---
A really good tank will lead the group to success with excellent leadership,  attack organization, going at the optimal speed of the make-up/gear level of the group. 
---
You could easily spend double or triple the amount of time with a bad tank. And of course, some of those will be wipefests, and then the group falls apart and you don't get through it at all.
---
Do you see the value of a top tank now? Running the instance 3 times in the same amount of time it might have taken, rolling the dice with some unknown fresh 60 who is there for the first time?
---
Or you could do it once and then have an hour or two to farm, making however much gold you make per hour.
---
Tanks are specced and geared for defense and survivability. They can't do much damage, so the farming that the dps classes can do just isn't efficient or profitable as a tank. So it's totally legit and respectable for a top tank to ask to be paid for the services they can provide. Basically,  you're paying a portion of the profits that you can make BY THAT TANK saving you a ton of time.
---
In 2v2 ret sucked, same for 3v3 really. They just lack the sustainainable dmg/control.
---
However in 5v5 ... they were good. Pair it up with a warrior to have a melee cleave and some CC -&gt; boom awesome combination. The main Focus from the ret is just to apply HoJ in the right Moment, get in 1-2 hits and otherwise just dispell/freedom the war.
---
Unless it’s multi-target healing from raid-wise damage, then they suck.
---
Yes, I forgot to mention AV, that was the additional way to increase rep.
---
Morrowgrain for darna/tb
---
then AV came out
---
Then cloth quartermasters
---
Im going priest and I know this is going to happen to me, just know it
---
Exactly the same here. Good luck bro!
---
Please ban those dumbasses
---
If you are looking to push the limits of your class. Engi is a must. Personally ive always liked min maxing in every game ive played. So for me its a must.
---
If you want to just play and not push the absolute max dps, tps, hps then you dont need to worry about running engi.
---
I want to get an epic mount this time. I played almost since release, raided up to naxx/aq40 (didn't finish those) but I never got enough gold to get a fast tiger. Respec costs always ate up my money before I even got to a few hundred gold.
---
I've heard you don't have layer problems when you don't have layers
---
Big if true
---
Making money. Always have been a poor player. But considering I now have a family I guess I'll have to beg for gold again.
---
I'm going to miss not having a guild bank just for my alts.
---
I just try to get the best choice of an awful lot. In my case this means going hunter after having been a hybrid dps/tank for my whole WoW experience, starting @ tbc. I'm absolutely unwilling to heal on 2 of my 3 main choices ( loathe rShaman, got to hate rDruid after being pushed hard into it by guild matters and well, pally feels fine, but it's pushed into healing for *anything*. Not interested in being a full-time healer being the lone wolf I am) and had enough bad experiences trying to escape that fate so it's just better to screw it all and try to get as close to my preferred playstyle as  possible.  
---
Hunter it is even if it's quite far from what I enjoy but at least it'll be a reliable experience with no nuisances about build and similar crap.
---
Hey u/Phenotyx and u/HorriblePerson6, did either of you consider maybe you’re both retarded?
---
The panda hate is somewhat a meme at this point.
---
Pandarens could be added for all I care, they don't have to be playable tho. And it doesn't have to be an expansion.
---
I don't like races cluttering the horde and alliance. 8 is enough, you'll start getting race combo's that aren't played and you make it harder for the developers to provide the game with gear that fits most of them all.
---
My biggest problem with MoP is that I'm not a fan of the Chinese culture theme, and that expansion was full of it. It basically turned Warcraft into a chinese RPG (aesthetically) and I was there for the orcs vs humans, wizards and knight fantasy feeling.
---
Pandaria could be a patch, a content that's the size of 2 zones, some quests a reputation, a raid.
---
Or if they HAVE to make an expansion out of it, do it like in Wotlk.
---
The entirety of Northrend doesn't all seem Viking to me. There are 2 zones that I'd consider viking themed, the rest of them have their own feeling. Pandaria is just "chinese in a forest, chinese in a field, chinese in the mountains, chinese in the snow".
---
I don't know man, I don't exactly feel immersed as a mouse cursor on windows.
---
Or people can play how they want :) I can't do what he's doing but I will be trying to marathon on 1 out of my 10 days off i am taking from work . 
---
Piss bottles anyone?
---
Is this a real gnome talking?
---
I’m a pro RPer
---
Your pet attacking doesnt take you, from my memory. I often used it with flag guarding on WSG. Put my owl in the room to one side, have her come out screeching while I wait and shoot them in the back as they look in the wrong direction. Great times.
---
When you're the only healer standing when the boss goes down, you're glad you decided to wear plate.
---
That's a clever trick. I like it.
---
&gt;finding a partner to do DM runs
---
I think it the most natural choice. Your partner doesn't even need to be regular. Just get any healer (ideally enchanter) and split the profit 50/50.
---
In the open world, your kill speed will be too slow, and you're very vulnerable if playing PvP. But if you have mining and/or herb than it's of course an option too.
---
(Genuine advice from a multi-glad).
---
haHAA so quirky and random!! James Franco!!!
---
Why didn't they release wc 3 reforged before classic is beyond me
---
Troll priest is pretty lethal in group play. A ranged instant cast no CD mortal strike effect + shadowguard was pretty damn nice. You just slap the debuff on whoever the focus is .
---
Really appreciate the info. With this new knowledge I guess I’ll level as a tank even though I hear leveling as a pally in any spec is a bitch but at least as a tank I’ll join groups quick. Guess I’ll stick to powerleveling peeps or soloing lower level dungeons for loot and just level a warrior for raids.
---
Oh think again you sausage boner
---
i don't know about you guys, but i would WELCOME a fresh take on WoW. let them take Classic and actually start over with better lore and better class design.
---
Down to Shaman or Rogue. Totally different but not sure where Iam these days. Ele resto might be the funniest build ever but Stealth is the best skill in the game :P
---
https://i.imgur.com/aWxtlff.jpg
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info
---
No, you don't put the cart before the horse. And it isn't working "well enough" yet, or people wouldn't be screaming at the top of their lungs at every possible exploit.
---
I don't like how it makes azeroth feel empty. All the "grown ups" are playing on an instanced continent somewhere in outer space, azeroth turns into a very big "starting zone".
---
This also brings us to the same problem with "what do we want in this game". We can't just keep repeating the same mistakes. Raid content -&gt; raid -&gt; raid -&gt; expansion, new zones level up to new cap -&gt; raid -&gt; raid -&gt; raid -&gt; raid -&gt; expansion -&gt; repeat.
---
And after 10 years you need to squish levels and your game is filled with content that no one will ever see because it's just too much at this point.
---
Outland could be a raid, or maybe a battleground similar to AV, made to last hours and filled with PVE encounters and quests. 
---
Just replacing our current high lvl zones with new ones, replacing our current raids with new ones is not a great idea.
---
Of course, I'm in favor of them opening a separate TBC server, and a separate WotLK server.
---
And frenchies! Those guys refuse to speak english!
---
I remember some strange tropical island east of Theramore or something like that. If I remember correctly it was filled with elites. I can't remember exactly what it was about it, but I found hat place really eerie.
---
Ya, watched a vid a couple min ago and it doesn’t break stealth. Fuck ya lol
---
I think I recall a ping trick that would cut it in half. You would tell the computer to only send 1 TCP ack package instead of 2, which improved latency quite drastically for me.
---
Being in a big progression guild. My original vanilla experience was being in a small F&amp;F guild. My only 40 man raiding experience in all of vanilla and BC was PUGs. And then WotLK happened and big raids were turned down to 25 people. I've done a lot of 10- and 25-man raiding but never really got the 40-man experience.
---
Yeah that's the distinction between continent and island in this conversation.
---
Pandaria could be a zone, doesn't need to be an expansion. Panda's don't need to be a playable race just because they exist in the lore.
---
Exactly! After all these years people have begun to realise that feral druids are decent tanks. A good player with a good attitude is always more fun to play with than a great player who is a tool.
---
Lmao I remember falling and getting lost
---
It was.
---
i havent watched the video but im gonna assume based on the thumbnail this is anti loot crate. as im sure most of you agree, classic wow desperately NEEDS crates to be even worth playing. like really, does anybody here really want to grind for endgame gear, materials, gold, etc.? OF COURSE NOT. we want to login in daily for our free box and have the option to buy more for $2.99/each.
---
honestly i dont see why they havent announced this feature yet...
---
get r12, bre and poon with my buddies
---
the fact that the gameplay sucks is a combination of MANY little things. 
---
Having your max-leveled players all in a sperate little instanced island (or planet, or way back in the past) makes the world feel empty. That's one of the things that contributes to feeling the game sucks more in retail.
---
But yes, the gameplay does suck, I forced myself to play again and just didn't feel it at all. The art is great tho.
---
From all I've heard watching Bellular and stuff, Blizzard is admitting they went off the road and are thinking over their philosophy of the game. So I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to make a WoW2 with a new engine, but carry over what made Classic special. If they are even able to do so.  After all those years people are kinda hardwired to all the immersion breaking conveniences and different class/spec designs.
---
If you believe 4Chan posts/leaks we're getting a fantasy looter shooter with Diablo 4. With that on the horizon I believe anything can happen.
---
My only issue is that 6 h sleep rest is ok. :)
---
The entirety of the Draenei's lore was retconned to go into TBC, I like their current lore a lot more than what they were before, but they didn't always follow the lore. I also don't feel like they *have to*, if they can make the game more interesting with good retcons, I'm fine with that. 
---
TBC is the thing you should ignore, it turns KT and Illidan into straight out villains, just for gameplay reasons.
---
this cracked me up tbh lmao
---
Idk. I found out when someone recommended switching the map on the UI in league of legends, made a world of difference for my map awareness.
---
I still don't see how you get more Lotus with Layering... One Server size in one layer with one Server worth of spawns. 
---
You just get several Servers in one Server. So it is still the same amount of Lotus per Person. 
---
The only way this could be abused is that one Person could jump layers in order to see if a Lotus spawn is active in another layer. That would be very tedious though to do for every possible spawn and in the end just running around is probably more worthwhile.
---
I feel this so much.
---
I played lvl 20 free to play trial twink on retail. And I stopped, came back 6 months later and I was still BiS and could enjoy the game instantly.
---
I played BFA at release, got myself to the heroic raid iLvl for my gear. I stopped playing for 3 months and when I return I find that I can get an almost full set of better gear by doing the new Warfront. 
---
So yeah...
---
private server 101
---
Yes, they could make different raids/dungeons/world bosses that drop gear that's similar to the gear in the other classic raids. Just change a few stats to make them unique and give more people different choices if they want to wear something similar but with that extra spirit instead of stamina (lol) or something.
---
Sidegrading in stead of upgrading.
---
nothing. If you have 5/5 wand spec and 5/5 spirit tap, then rest of the points don't mater much until \~45 when shadow starts to be noticeably faster (45 is when you can have shadowform, 5/5 wand spec, and a worthy rank of Mind Flay which sucks prior to this). Holy is in fact more efficient and arguably higher dps until then. It still would be more efficient afterwards to, but the killing speed can't keep up.
---
Every corner of WoW is explored and optimised by players. So why not do something you, and many others have never/rarely seen before?
---
 If you are already set on playing pally, go for it. The extra challenge, and reward you will get out of getting that raid slot, or plowing thru the 5 mans will be so much better than doing the same path as every other Prot Warrior.
---
Get invested in the class fantasy and your toon, not the numbers behind them. It is supposed to be a role playing game, so find a class that you wan't to be. Of course take note of your possible role later on, but you should pick a class because you like the class, not because you want to play $max_damage_dealer or $best_utility_in_pvp.
---
yeah, they did it to "save time"
---
Lol just me ranting about how most MMOs have weird micro transactions/DLC in them and boasting about how great classic will be without it. Atleast I hope, I don’t trust blizzard anymore. And classic does seem too good to be true.
---
Yea, because classic's shortcomings are what this thread was about. You sure showed me.
---
Just melt the mage's face after that to feel better.
---
cooking and fishing for me!
---
Make it though Nax.  But mostly I'll spend my time doing world PvP.
---
You are actually a boomer 😂
---
Playing WoW
---
:P
---
What's your class?
---
It's crazy to me how obsessed this sub is with getting 60 at fast as possible for... reasons?
---
Are most people here retail players primarily? The game is very different, the content focus is NOT all loaded at the end.
---
There is so much between 1-60 that everyone seems to be dead-set on entirely skipping, it makes me sad.
---
!remindme 58 days
---
Language specific EU servers &gt; RP-PvP
---
Something to keep in mind: Private servers are much more generous than Classic servers are with respawn times.
---
It's not only for blind, you can get off warrior bleeds to bandage after a trap, remove devluring plague and druid openers too.
---
Yet TBC had the best gameplay out of every expansion ...
---
This was actually better than I was expecting.  Not new information, but still worth watching.
---
Maybe you should stop wasting all of our time and go play Xbox Live since it’s so great
---
Just when I thought we got over the wave of absolutely idiotic topics for a little while you come along and take the crown. Congrats!
---
OP literally asked a question. What?
---
If you’re not wearing some Walter White whitie tighties I don’t want to see it
---
Agreed, the problem is that there’s no way to avoid the danger. 
---
Eve online had a similar sense of “oh shit I might be about to die”, but you could channel that fear into avoiding dying, and that was thrilling stuff. 
---
Eve felt like paintball, PvP servers are like a pulmonary embolism.
---
Unfortunately, this will be the other way around. I was a teenager back in Vanilla, with plenty of game time. The result being my druid to be over geared (mid-Nax)
---
This time around, I don't think I will have the time to max gear my characters.
---
&gt;You have tunnel visioned yourself into believing that there might only be a handful of servers. Likewise Blizzard might be suffering from the same sort of issue, neglecting that if the server size after phase 2 is a max of 3k and their concurrent players are higher than 20k come phase 2 and if they have only 5 servers then they are stuffed.
---
It's the drama that I'm looking forward to at this point, really. They're fully expecting a huge number of players to be just tourists who don't stick, to the point that it worries me immensely. It's gonna be a special type of drama when phase 2 hits and they are practically unable to remove layering due to sheer number of concurrent players as a result of far more people sticking with the game than they anticipated.
---
very different aesthethics though.
---
Reserve or demand anything you like, as long as you inform everyone about it beforehand. 
---
Just a tip though, this is t really viable or effective in the start. Tanks who don’t collect dps gear still needs a ton of items, and could also use different pieces for different situations or gear combinations.  If you want dps gear as well, you’ll need to run and probably farm all of them. 
---
This means all warriors will need to farm basically al dungeons on a fresh server, leaving less room to reserve anything at all. 
---
This changes quickly once people start raiding though.
---
You're right, but pickpocketing is still a nice way to make some extra gold while farming other stuff. For example in BRD the Fiery Weapon Formula will make you the most gold, on top of that you have chest spawns. Pickpocketing eill still be nice as I've seen Frostadamus make quite some gold from it on Classic Beta (which is capped at lvl 40 so you'd obviously make more from higher level mobs) but most of the gold comes from raw silver looting + rare gems like Aquamarines etc
---
100% agree. People act like its pokemon or another turn based game. The only thing this min maxing dilemma really  affects is fair 1v1 dueling. I think a lot of people underestimate the amount of strategy and skill this game takes to be actually good. I considered myself above average and knew a lot about the game. Yet the people better than me were miles ahead.
---
Horde
---
Agreed. It always seemed a strange addition to the game to me.
---
Get them to tell you next weeks lotto numbers while they're at it.
---
I leveled a holy priest for BC for BC launch and it was pretty easy if you are ok with just slamming the fuck out of dungeons. I literally just sat outside of them and advertised my services and tried to find groups that were ok just running the same dungeon repeatedly until I could go somewhere better. Took about a month of playing after school. I don’t remember the actual played time but it wasn’t bad
---
&gt;All I want in life is to be an orc warrior tank.
---
Something we can all relate to, I think.
---
There is no way to tell until we are there
---
Uou can do fine going 5/0/5 wand and spirit thing
---
Then go disc/holy smite spec
---
Good luck with your shedule pre level 15 when everyone is doing the same thing
---
Easy is a relative term. It's doable with time investment but I think easy is a stretch for the average person.
---
In the clip I showed on this video I played on a server which had the netting ability. Sure, it makes it more difficult, which is why I couldn't pull the entire room and it caused me to die once or twice, but as you see in the vid it's still possible. Also if you're worried about macros to teleport you out of the dungeon, this farm takes place at the entrance so you can just walk out. So yes, it will be possible 😊
---
Depends on servers H/A ratio and also if people on the server are interested in PvP
---
dreaming mages gonna be far behind warriors :D only some fights will they be superior
---
They do indeed, netting does make it more difficult but far from impossible and still a great farm
---
Of course you can avoid the danger. This is a multiplayer game grab a friend, or a stranger and group up. Far less likely to get ganked.
---
You'll be the only one trolling around!.. 
---
I'll show myself out
---
As a Tank I took a lot of pleasure in watching this. 
---
"Oh DPS pulled...." 
---
*NinjapullDPS dies* 
---
"Time to tank"
---
No, it was still insane, maybe a little bit easier because of some talents. Like the druid tree form. :D
---
True that. There was some real good world pvp opportunities with rare mats
---
&gt;code repository
---
What do you think is in a code repository?
---
this is why im paying someone to get me to 60 within 5 days :) dont need time of work or ruin my body by lack of sleep :D GL with the journey stay hydrated
---
Yeah, people cried about it but Legion Illidan was far more accurate than BC Illidan.
---
It's not a huge deal at all. Lmao. 5% intellect is pretty much a non-factor when you think about it. Racial active abilities and weapon skill modifiers are the ones people care about.
---
No no no we want a definitive answer
---
I love speedrunning. I have no problem with going nolife. But for a first character in classic, what makes you want to level up so fast?
---
I don't get it
---
I might not have a warrior's full kit as a druid, or a rogue's stunlocks, but I can heal, tank and dps any dungeon, and even raids if I tryhard. 
---
And that's without ever changing my spec :)
---
I might not be able to oneshot people like a PoM-Pyro mage, but as a shadowpriest I can both heal dungeons AND melt faces in BGs. 
---
I like to be able to fill more than one role, and  variety, for me, is more interesting and fun than numbers :)
---
Fine.. LoK'Tar Ogar!
---
And you do know that private vanilla servers have been around for many many years right?
---
This is ridiculously cringe. Mostly because it's not true.
---
3% above nr2 is not 'barely at #1 it is a convincing #1'. Warrior is so far ahead that it leaves the biggest gap. The other classes aren't even 1% apart from each other.
---
*wakes up from first sleep* 
---
[Server] Shutdown in 15 minutes.
---
Nahhhhh m8 im gonna play a night elf mohawk using only cloth gear and a broken shortsword and nobody can stop me
---
I think you underestimate the bow skill advantage
---
Really wish I could play the campaign in a 2-player coop mode. My wife is not really into RTS, but I really feel she’s missing out on all the lore.
---
&gt; Look at something far away, extend your arms placing your hands together and make a triangle opening with your thumbs and index finger
---
Alright Tien Shinhan.

Ah the "I'm secretly racist" defense, nice. Translates too "I can't believe them ching chongs got in mah fantersy bout the good ol, white west."

---
Blood Elf master race, sry bb
---
Might as well level it to 60 for the 100% mount :D
---
I want to actually participate in the AQ gate opening.  I was there when it first happened, but due to technical issues It wasn't an enjoyable experience.
---
I thought I remembered this too but not sure.
---
Yeah, why be unique and interesting when you could blindly follow a trope and put elves next to the humans like any other fantasy hack.
---
Some people plan their lives around a passion. His is racing towards end-game. He gets more fun out of the game if he is able to juice every second out of the race.
---
Just like how athletes have a sleep schedule. There are also athletes that don't compete professionally that do this as a hobby.
---
The only difference with sports and gaming is the view you have on it, influenced by your society. But in the end they are both things the person is doing with their free time because they enjoy doing it. One thing will give you a nice body, and the other won't. That's not sad.
---
It's sad that there are people in the world that don't have a passion and feel the need to bring other people down for it. I have a passion for my car and just because it's a van and not a sports car it's "sad", according to some colleagues. 
---
Get your head out of your butt and let people enjoy their free time without trying to make yourself seem better than them. He's happy, you're sad.
---
Barons mount from strath! But honestly, level feral druid. Tank like an Abrams:-)
---
Obviously don't play something you don't want to play. Honestly I don't think it's even really possible to get to 60 if you're not enjoying the gameplay. This can lead to some weird scenarios where the gameplay up to 60 is very unlike the gameplay at 60, but in most cases if it feels good to lvl, it'll feel good at 60.
---
It'll shake itself out. Even if you try to go for optimal choices, if you hate it you'll likely find yourself messing round and leveling your bank alt.
---
Don't worry about it.
---
I focus on the positives. Maybe I'll suck at warrior and there will be so many warriors I can't find a raiding spot as any spec. But I know I'll be able to tank for my friends in dungeons and that's always fun. Worst thing that could happen is I have to wait to see what kind of classes are needed for raid content on my server and make one of those aswell. Plenty of time to do all this.
---
PvP realm, and playing in STV instead of Desolace will halt your leveling speed.
---
Back in Vanilla I used to struggle a lot against Warlocks as Feral. They'd always Death Coil -&gt; Fear me. So one time I used Dash just before the coil. Turns out that made me fast enough to get coiled out of Fear range before the cast went off. Simple trick, but it did allow me to beat almost any Warlock.
---
So yeah, Fear generally didn't make you slow.
---
I do have some memories of people walking slowly while feared, but IIRC that happened mostly indoors when the feared target got stuck in corners etc.
---
He also only did puggable content lol
---
That 5hp regen came in clutch
---
Never restrict the beta test to a audience that's been waiting 15 years for this and has plenty of time to think.
---
Your middle dream is not hard at all. Aq40 is very easy twil twin emps. You can do it mate.
---
Why is it torture if the guy is enjoying himself? Stop telling others how to play and let them enjoy it.
---
Unless you’re into ninjas and rogue gameplay, I think trading shaman toolkit for just stealth is not worth it.
---
Lol
---
Some people see this as a race. They like competing with eachother to see who can be the first at lvl 60. They'll have their seconds of fame and maybe even have their character name on the front page of WoWhead, MMO-Champion, /r/wow and /r/classicwow
---
So if you want to race, it's got to be your first character.
---
I'd never enjoy it myself, but I can get behind the idea of other people doing it. It can feel nice to be able to understand the game THAT well, that you know the perfect route to level the quickest.
---
Having said that, he won't win the race if he plans on sleeping. Other people will just share their account with their friend or brother.
---
No, because then there wouldn be any more classic and people will start to miss it yet again and complain. + where will it end if they continue like that? We will end up having the shitshow wod,legion and bfa are now again...
---
You can get R10 by playing AV a few hours a day. The average person can do it.
---
Kill KT, up to 9/15 on pserver but due to classic am fighting people's lack of motivation weekly.
---
Yes, locks have so much going on when leveling, compared to the other two.
---
The client used for classic is a retail client with 1.12 data, this is why there's bug and retail here and there.  
---
But Blizzard also have a vanilla 1.12 server runnig, to compare what they have in classic and how it was in vanilla.
---
Faction with less/significantly less population will get instant to almost instant q’s.
---
Playing vanilla.
---
Yeah, being able to remove Magic and Poison with one cast is extremely useful, especially in PvP.
---
I really like your combat text. What addon is that?
---
What advantage is that?  Having to use a lower damage weapon so that you can get +.3 to hit?  The only time that bows out damage the slower cross bows is when you get Rhok'delar.  Before that crossbows are better and after you're clearing Cromangus Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting is better than any other bow in the game.
---
These ones?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_5ZEYd8K9M0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5ZEYd8K9M0)
---
Yeah, I'm not sure where this criticism comes from. Pandaria was absolutely refreshing as a setting and it was gorgeous to boot.
---
Why should the goblin engi caster not pvp
---
From what I understand, the weapon skill is actually like 3% to hit against raid bosses.
---
Not to be pedantic, but Pokemon is a pretty bad example of minmaxing as 99% of players play the game just fine without doing it. You dont have to completely minmax there either to have fun or win battles.
---
You are either a moron or just trolling if you don't see the difference between racism and having a bias towards what culture you enjoy watching in movies and games.
---
I don't have to shy away to proudly say that I enjoy the cultural feeling of the Tauren, the Zandalari, Uldum, the Vrykul.
---
I shouldn't have to hide the fact that I don't enjoy the Pandaren culture as much.
---
I hope you understand that what you just did here was completely short sighted.
---
You can enjoy Chinese culture in video games, while I can't. That's not what racism is. There's no one being discriminated here, there's no victim. I've got nothing against the Chinese or their culture, I just don't enjoy living out a fantasy inside of it.
---
Thank you!!
---
Didn't think it was a two roll system. Thanks!
---
Damn, I expected standard WoW animation, but the animation is amazing!
---
Went round a friends house who got the game on release and he showed me the game. His character was called Bigdave. I was hooked and begged my dad to get me the game the next day. He did and my character was called Littledave. The two daves stomped their way through Azeroth together for many, many hours. Wonderful times.
---
You know what? That was an incredibly well thought out and patient response. I believe you, though I still think the other 90% of Pandaria haters are racist.
---
damn, I didnt know sunwell was part of vanilla lmao
---
Thank you. I could also believe that your experience with other people who hate on the expansion might have made you jump to that conclusion.
---
Because I have met these people as well and they are not shy about it.
---
You do realize many people just dont care? It will take years to exhaust ALL things to do in classic. You not wanting to finish that wintersaber grind, getting thunderfury or getting exalted with the pirates is your problem. And when all is finished, whos to say people wont enjoy it for what it is? Log in every day, couple times a week, play some wpvp, bg’s, roflstomp some dungeons for fun, just chat with friends in game.... duel, have organized arena games, 2v3, 3v3, 4v4 etc competitions... endless things to do.. stop complaining and enjoy it for what it is forever.
---
You play the game the way you want and let the others do the same please.
---
i believe OP was making one of those things called a joke
---
Obviously just screenshots of code snippets and cakes, duh!
---
The gameplay of MoP was fantastic. Why aren’t we allowed to like that aspect but not the pandas? They’re completely separated elements of the expansion.
---
Fuck pandas.
---
Holy shit, i'm going casual hunter since being tank seems like it will clash with my ''I gtg'' real life things.  
---
While as hunter i can just ''Feign death'' and brb.
---
Most French and German players probably can speak english pretty well and it won't be all that different from having Danes, Swedes and Poles etc. on the server as it was back in the day.
---
Sucks for the French and German players though.
---
A lot of people come from pservers and have done the leveling multiple times.
---
&gt;and + bow skill
---
the best endgame weapons are xbows though
---
More space for us!
---
People min-max because they love doing it. I love being the absolute best i can, that is a big part of what makes a multiplayer game fun.
---
Some people care less about it and they're very welcome to, but i dont see the reason to be upset that other people want to be as good as they can.
---
Casual af..

---
This. 
---
Rushing to 60 is like ignoring half the game we all waited for for so many years. 
---
Take your time, enjoy the content and especially the community. I will ding 60 in like 30 days and its still phase 1. When phase 2 starts, i will be geared like everyone else
---
I love it how you can see the gear progress from the first bosses to KT. Awesome.
---
You do you man. Let people play the way they want. No one is forcing you to min-max.
---
That's possible, didn't think of that.
---
Sorry i don't know. :(
---
Once fire becomes viable the ignite stacking guarantees one mage will be at the top :p
---
Your'e not remembering wrong. And it should be even a bigger accomplishment because Cata launch was the PINNACLE of WoW's subscriber count.
---
If you take everything into account.
---
The new zones were spread, some started in Hyjal, some in Twilight Highlands.
---
2 new races which also had a lot of people starting in that zone instead.
---
Pretty smart.
---
The WoW Classic launch will have the similar effect of everyone starting in seperate zones.
---
But everyone is lvl 1 so it's not like there are people that AREN'T in those zones, which expansion releases did have.
---
I mostly fear for the Barrens, 3 days after launch. 3 races coming together, and a lot of forsaken also heading over for nostalgia sake.
---
I might consider bringing my troll to silverpine instead.
---
Yeah that was insane, 6 raiddays (progress) / week. ;)
---
No it was from the scourge invasion. :)
---
you do know that warriors get stronger and stronger as new raids come out? warriors start to scale extremely hard soon as aq40 comes out. by time naxx is out and clearing that no way a mage will keep up with a warrior
---
Tauren warriors, to the point that I had a nightmare where I was being chased one.
---
I raided as a warlock myself and soul shards are really not an issue whatsoever. You just get a big soulshard bag (core felcloth one is a good investment) and keep it topped up. You can make shards from raid trash as you go along. Have like a full bag of them before start so you can summon slackers or make a soulstone or some healthstones but believe me it's not an issue. Also shards don't disappear, you can have a farming session before raid or day before to make them.
---
the leveling experience
---
i came in midway through TBC and by then the leveling experience was catered towards vets getting their alts to max level as quickly as possible. so i don't think i ever got to experience what it was actually like to level where everyone was on the same page. well, wrath release was fun. but again i think that was a much more individually tailored experience. and leveling, to me, should be an important aspect of the game. where players are encouraged to interact and cooperate. and choosing specs should be a playstyle where those who take on supportive roles should be welcomed. and i don't just mean dungeon crawling either. if someone wants to play a healer or tank they should still be able to practice their trade and feel like they're actually contributing.
---
it actually wasn't until i joined an RP server did i realize that leveling was a very fun experience. it was neat seeing all the lowbies socializing and not concerned about the end game. because for them that was the game. and while i was never into social RP, taking a more RP approach with my character made me appreciate what leveling can be for the game. which for me was being drastically undergeared, no heirlooms, having food and potions ready, using only public transportation, etc. 
---
well, that is until i hit the xpac zones where it was literally just me out there. then it was a bummer again..
---
I think people remember min-maxing differently to how it actually was; there was probably like 5% of players who where progressive raiders looking for world firsts that enforced builds and bis, but outside of that, I don't think it was as much as a thing as people on here are making out.
---
to put it another way, you think you do, but you dont....need to min-max to be competitive.
---
Unless you're being really dumb and trying to raid MC as a fire build or something, no one will really care.
---
I remember seeing allsorts of builds and crazy trinkets etc on toons for specific ability boots and the like, none of it was bis or for min maxing, it was for fun.
---
I really do think that we've inflated the min max conversation on reddit (not aimed at you op), when it actual fact (especially on 1.12) most people will play how they want to play and still be near-optimal for 90% of the content.
---
Outland*
---
Adrian Pimento yoga tighties got nothing on WWs
---
Level 60
---
Oh, well that certainly changes things :D
---
I just really hope Blizzard doesn't cater to the most hardcore 24/7 players when it comes to content releases.
---
Like don't release BWL early just because an ultra hardcore guild downed Ragnaros in the first week.
---
I don't think I'll be level 60 until mid/late September, playing at a steady pace
---
good old aegwynn days :)
---
I mean, kind of...?  It's hard not to see a schedule like this and get the feeling that there is something fundamentally extremely unhealthy about it.
---
I played like this once a few years back on Nostalrius when it launched.  I got 60 in under 2 weeks, got T1 belt from trash drop in MC pug the 3rd week, and quit the 4th week because I felt so awful all the time I was starting to think about killing myself because of the stress and lack of sleep and general unhealthiness.  And that was with taking a 90 minute break each day to go to the gym and swim a kilometer.  It's not for me, but I have a hard time believing it's for other people too.  Who knows.

Fuck that, I remember the TBC launch. Staying up until 4am on a work night, trying to play and having nothing but frustration, unplayable lag, overcrowding and disconnects does not make a happy memory.
---
He replied to this and said it was pre-patch, so all 60. New talents though.
---
Rendhammer, let the children play, the natural force of wanting to powerlevel is to enormous, it will take years to learn the patience game of leveling slow and peacefully xP
---
I agree 100% with this sentiment, but there are cultural trends that are much harder to take or combat. Let's say, for example, druids just become cultural outcasts. Then this tidal wave of perception can affect me! So I understand OP's point. Culture is impossible to manage.
---
I'd prefer a culture of laid back adventurers who like "cool things" above all else -- with a 15-year-old game that has been "figured out" I doubt this type of culture will take hold. Efficiency will win the day.
---
As warlock you do DM:N boss farm. Which, suprisingly, wasn't included in this guide.
---
People schedule their sleep everyday to go to work, which is far more sad for me.
---
There's not much you can do about it. Almost every game nowadays will have min-maxing because the internet is so much more connecting now.
---
It's very easy to share your research on anything and it's easy for others to find it. It wasn't so simple back in the day.
---
Most mmorpgs today will have hundreds of guides and metas of people telling others whats best. And unfortunately it'll stay this way.
---
Unless you play a game for the first month of launch when info is still being gathered, you'll always have the problem of everyone knowing whats best.
---
This made me laugh a lot harder than it should have.
---
That's true if you're so bad you can't win a single fight. I'm always happy when a warrior or a rogue engages me, as a hunter. That means I'll get a kill.
---
SeRiOUs RaIDeR
---
The joke that just keeps giving!
---
Your life is sad. Mby you should tell us what are you are gonna do? Meet with ur friends or familly? Such a waste of time...
---
Hey they can ALL do what they want! I just want to let people know (who may be unaware) that the game is vast and full of life and content from the beginning to the end.
---
Enjoy it as you see fit!
---
I play Warrior
---
Most people are on during the day, so sleeping during the day will give him better odds of having less competition during the leveling process, at least until he gets ahead of the pack.
---
Odds are decent to high that he also enjoys smoking marijuana, and generally lifestyles like this are best lived nocturnally.
---
You dont get the point, if you add up all the dots to the overall raiddmg, the dmfg will increase by a huge amount —&gt; Bosses will die a lot faster —&gt; raids gettin way easier
---
sorry but layering means multiple servers worth of spawns but on 1 server... if it where multiple servers with 1 servers loot worth then imagine seeing a chest ur about to loot just despawn with no apparant reason.
---
eitherway there are a ton of recordings displaying exploits by using layering to get the ZG trinket or other...
---
The EQ Reddit has just over 11k members. I don't think it would be smart to try to take any "how to handle overpopulation" tips from that game.
---
p.s. I loved Everquest. Played a Necro all 4 years of high school until quitting in college.
---
Technically, it's not. "Client" means the game client, aka the software on your computer, which they are using the modern Wotlk client. Same thing for server.
---
What they are using is the vanilla data set, but they had to do guess work to fill in the holes and got help from the biggest private server devs to do so, it was in a dev interview.
---
To avoid traffic. Less people = more mobs
---
Is the pre-raid BIS PvP gear good enough to use in PvE MC or ZG?
---
I thought showing you is what this thread is about.
---
Btw I just looked up the PVP R10 set. It has no spell dmg at all. 
---
Could you look up T1 set &amp; R10 set again, and give me your opinion on what’s more worth my time? :)
---
Cleared everything pretty much on human protadin in TBC
---
Put like 2 bars of ore or 2 herbs with the middle-lower price of the 20s stacks. It works from time to time.
---
Blizzard dont want to be paying for dead servers. They want as little blank spaces as possible seperating servers by language leaves more blank spaces that could be filled. 
---
I feel at this point they will stick to international servers and let the community sort it out, unless they get alot of pressure. Tough luck to those who dont research and possible paid transfers later on.
---
I liked Outlands but TBC and Wotlk while fun were the root of basically everything that's wrong with WoW today, from Arenas leading to a very competitive balance centered class design model to expansions making everything before them obsolete and probably worst of all making the storyline about fighting against increasingly absurd apocalypses.
---
I actually quite liked most of the additions but I'm a sucker for the weird parts of DnD like Spelljammer or Dark Sun. Also by the end of TBC basically everything interesting about Blood Elves had been resolved and they were much more regular nice-guy elves instead of the arseholes hiding their increasing desperation behind a veneer of civilization they started out.

If you automatically assume that a nelf priest has &lt;75 IQ, I wouldnt be so sure about what guild you end up being in, mate.

I am not concerned about any early game zerg leveling as I've created an unorthodox route to get ahead of the zerg which I have successfully used on the Level 15 Stress test on Server 15 (Highest Pop Server of the stress test) where I was able to obtain realm first 15 Warrior &amp; Realm 2nd overall. Screenshot as proof from a bit after I dinged  [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/508094373184143360/591714435802988564/WoWScrnShot\_061919\_200207.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/508094373184143360/591714435802988564/WoWScrnShot_061919_200207.jpg)
---
Thanks for clearing that up Ross
---
My plan is to be feral/resto,b so I plan to roll on tank, healing AND DPS gear. I think it's fine as long as you inform people properly.
---
Well there are no funny classic stories yet, no new fun PvP movies and no RP events.
---
The people you see here on reddit so long in advance arn't your casual players. Some of us are waiting 15 years, been on private servers for years or have been hoping on classics return for years. We want to do it better this time around. We have to knowlage just not the game to execute it yet.
---
I bet 95% of the people does not care about min maxing and 98% of the people should not even care much about it because they arn't in that "hardcore guild" whete its needed.
---
I bet once the game is out we will see more meme's, art, stories and funny videos. But untill than I like to theoriecraft my route, goals plans etc.
---
You know, that’s a fair point. TBC’s lore was kind of silly sometimes.  Draenei are space goat gypsies who use their gods like batteries, KT is a crack addict, and Illidan becomes big bad guy because reasons.
---
Warlock is the second best to kite after hunter. You have to cast Curse of Doom on her, dot and run around the island until the curse takes effect.

[Stop stealing Beer Ross](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/david-schwimmer-ross-friends-lookalike-arrested-theft-beer-blackpool-police-a8631536.html)
---
It shouldn't do, but why on earth would you want to skip it?
---
how could you lvl so fast while there will be no mobs for killing and stuff for gathering ? :D
---
So there is that thing called mana oil that have 5 charges but the number of charge only appear in the tooltip of the item so just craft them, use it 4 times then put it at the AH at the same price as the one with 5 charges.
---
There is always someone to be fooled and buy it
---
WRONG
---
leeway was a contingency plan to counter lag issues of their servers at that time, it would be the same as saying u should be limited to a 0.3 MB to 1MB connection while playing the game... along with the servers needing to be toned down quite significantly...
---
these days even the least civilized people have 30-50mb while the norm is around 70-100+ MB and it is possible to reach 1 GB depending on contract &amp; locations...
---
leeway was never part of the game, it was something blizzard where forced into as they had no other options back then... their servers back in the day where more unstable than pservers, lagspikes and shutdowns where not uncommon at all.
---
time to wake up...
---
Very crafty, I like it
---
If your raid is getting kills where all your healers died you probably wanna address a lot more things than wearing inferior healing gear because it has armor on it lol
---
You'd need a minimum of three to cover blessings of wisdom/ might, salvation and kings. More would certainly be welcome, assuming heal spec. Prot and Ret will have a harder time, in equal parts due to reasonable concerns over class design, and unreasonable prejudice.
---
you can but you should not, the other pets are entirely disconnected from eachother, the order in which you obtain them is irrelevant but it will slow your leveling down and groups will ask you a lot and look down upon your choices not to mention its very short.
---
Basic personal hygiene.
---
Ya I definitely agree that everyone should take their time and enjoy the game. I hate hearing my friends who are new to vanilla stressing about leveling routes. But as a seasoned 4x level 60 player from private servers i'm not losing much. I've experienced leveling 4 times and I still love it. It's just more fun to me trying to speed up my times
---
If I can chill it, I can kill it.
---
Honestly... i am hoping for it. The more servers that exist the more I worry I am going to play on a server that dies from being full of tourists. I know I really shouldnt have to worry, but I still do.
---
There must be other unit frames libs you can plug in though? Depends how much time you want to put into it I guess, as uncoupling the old lib and plugging in a new one is a massive re-write
---
I've been using the Hunter discord's [Potential Bugs List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=992486865) to track how often new build versions are pushed. It recently went from 3 fixed issues (out of \~40) to 8. So that's something.
---
Ah yes that was it. Thanks.
---
I linked three different things. I was talking about warrior barely being #1 on the [40k response survey](https://www.strawpoll.me/17557953/r).. #1 Warrior 4889 votes, #2 Warlock 4694 votes. That's a 195 difference between the two.
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/BLaOzJG.png) a popular private server. Warrior is #2.
---
You also have to consider that +/- 20% of your raid is going to be a Warrior.
---
We're all haunted by our past.. Few of us ever get the opportunity. To change it.
---
"features"? No.
---
It has some Blizzard bullshit like layering but systems and mechanics, no.
---
Next.
---
Because it's going to slow me down on launch
---
Nah it's good. You can't abuse gankers/gankees.
---
I play a lot of private servers this will essentially be my 5th level 60 character.
---
Great guide, was just going to add that you can use Crystal of Zin-Malor to kill yourself and ghost-walk into the dungeon. This way you can save durability-cost. 
---
Good option for mages who want to aoe farm DM:E. It’s not optimal of course but without /camp it’s the best sulotion.
---
Shieet true. Time to pop some addy
---
Whats the point in ruining the game for 2 months with layering if it wont fix log in queues and mass hordes of players at starting zones?
---
nice to see your post. you never replied to me in instant message and i was serious about it :(  
---
never mind, thank you for this.
---
Subjective. :) That's not to disagree. I loved a lot of TBC's gameplay. But in retrospect, I think I enjoyed more of Wrath--including gameplay, but especially the storylines.
---
I feel like they should either allow these to work, or re-sell these cosmetics (or re-give them out somehow) for classic.  They were in the game in vanilla so it's difficult for the #nochanges folk, like myself, to argue against them.
---
Thanks. I believe competing with others for kills on launch will slow me down and as of now I don't need the imp to level efficiently
---
He explicitly said it was a tribute to “class AND SPEC” and since he’s a frost mage..
---
any Elite/Rare (golden/silver dragon) because unless you're good at kiting, you can't solo those and you'll be rewarded a free corpse run.
---
Scammed on the auction house, before gold and silver were easily distinguishable.  I only did it the once, since I felt a \*wee\* bit bad for the poor hunter who bought a stack of thorium shells for 150g instead of 1g50s.
---
Why would you want to lvl up fast?
---
On my Server it was defenitely the Alliance with shorter Queue times simply because it was like 65:35 Ratio Horde:Alliance...
---
So there were always plenty of hordes queuing and I almost always got instant invite for WSG/AB.
---
As for now it is impossible to give a definite answer. If you can tell me the Ratio your Server is going to have I'll happily help :)
---
What about a dwarf priest? Aint those the best priest class-race combo for alliance?
---
it's not that it's not doable, it's just sub optimal.  Better to go full shadow (with perhaps 5 in wand spec) and do way more damage when soloing.  It's not like you need any holy spec stuff to heal until lategame, and when leveling as shadow you still want mostly int/spirit gear as you do when healing so you don't even really have to collect a secondary gear set when leveling like hybrids do.
---
400 IQ move. Well played Sir. You win!
---
that must've been a stressful weekend for you.
---
Level with someone and holy is suddenly great :)
---
I doubt you'll be level 10 by 5-6pm just by virtue of login servers and early quest being overcrowded.
---
Sorry for the doubt
---
those stones we're a good sell.
---
I don’t remember this at all. I didn’t know any prot warriors; I knew tanks that respecced to prot on raid nights but were arms any other time. Same goes for rogues who would gank with daggers but switch over to swords on thursdays or whenever the fuck. Or mages that had to go deep arcane for the spell damage that definitely didn’t want to keep it for farming or pvping
---
I'm going Forsaken Warrior and will be mainly playing PvE.  
---
So I say fuck em.
---
There really is no difference in 90% of the vanilla encounters. And for the other 10% having more than 2 dwarf priests doesn’t make any noticeable difference. So no, it really doesn’t matter. 
---
The real question is if you want stone form ( 3 min cd) and a &lt;free health pot on 10 min cd&gt; or shadow meld for pvp.  The latter will be far more used, but it will not aid you if you are getting opened upon.
---
Duskwood in the whole, featuring "Mor"oneshot"ladin".... he scared me
---
Undead Priests are really over rated. People always hype up devouring plague, but it's getting insta dispelled in any competent PvP situation. It's good for duels against classes that cannot dispel it, but Shadow Priests don't really need much help there in the first place. Shadowguard is really good as it procs max range blackouts on people trying to focus you in PvP and it disrupts Rogue/Warrior openers; plus, it scales quite well with spellpower and does some nice damage. The mortal strike effect from their unique hex spell comes in handy for beating classes that have self heals and it's great for WPvP where people tend to use health potions a lot more.
---
Exactly, this is why I’ve started tanking/ offtanking dungeons on my rogue on a private server. 
---
Guild is dead and I don’t feel like begging for a spot in naxx with other guilds so I’ve started doing weird stuff instead.
---
Exactly, it will be more popular than private server.
---
Also  if I'm not wrong classic and retail will use the same login server. Hope that it's not too bad.
---
To get to the fun part of the game quicker
---
I mean.... I'd argue getting mind flay at 25 is pretty decent (assuming 5 points in wand spec).
---
You can wear whatever gear you want and spec however you want. Nobody will force you into playing in a way you don't enjoy, most raid groups and pvp premades probably will but that's like a fraction of the content.
---
Yeah, but priests will always be the go to for healing. Having infinite mana isnt an advantage when the fight end before the priests go oom. But I get what you are saying.
---
It works, you can have an alt in the party with your main. When you cleared the instance, relogg your alt and do the macro, relogg your main and you'll be at the entrance with a fresh instance. (At least this works on the BETA server).
---
Really interested in what your early game tactic is... maybe pm me? Haha.
---
Also rolling warrior, also pserver player of many years. So excited for release.. love fresh server runs!
---
Good luck! &gt;:D
---
Str+agi too. Itll instantly sell in my experience.
---
I dunno, if they use the exact loot table formulas as vanilla....I think people forget how much it sucked to compete for loot in a 40m raid. My guild ran MC for better part of a year and some pieces only ever dropped once for us.
---
A single mage holding ignite for the fight will beat warriors. Warriors will smash mages as a class but.
---
Keeping that for later.
---
Warriors will be held back by threat, mages will not.
---
For what purpose?
---
not so much on alliance side with salvation buff it helps so much.
---
It's going to speed up killing in the long run. I mean you will have it for 6-7 levels anyway.
---
Worth it i'd say.
---
Server's were surprisingly reliable on Stress Test's Server 15. Also we were the first ones to kill Garrik in Northshire as well as the first to kill Goldtooth &amp; finish all of Fargodeep mine. Infact it felt like the front of the zerg was just arriving as we were leaving. Eastvale Logging camp was completely ours with zero competition.

---
Got the route down just really hoping for some good servers on launch
---
Also just the simple fact that traveling is pretty much instant in current wow, and they're are Auction houses all over the place. Makes having a bank/ah alt pretty much pointless.
---
Most of the players that play dwarf priest are newbs that has read on reddit that they need to be dwarf to play a priest. The amount of bad players that play dwarf is far larger than any other race/class combination in this game. That is how it has been on all private servers at least, and that is also how it most likely will be in classic.
---
Yes exactly multiple Servers worth of spawns but on one Server in different layers. 
---
1 Server worth of spawns for 1 Server worth of Population (3-5k I guess). 
---
Just that there is multiple layers meaning you will have (for example) 5layers - 5 Servers worth of spawns for 5 Servers worth of People. 
---
Of course one Person can layer jump and get more black Lotus than he should - but it is tedious to layer jump - and there isn't more Black Lotus than there should be.
---
It is just more black Lotus on one Server.
---
It doesn't screw the economy. It just might make it slightly more difficult to find a black Lotus for someone not layer hopping.
---
But given the sheer amount of spawns it will not be worthwhile to farm black Lotus that way.
---
For the Gurubashi Chest on the other Hand that is true... That sucks and I do hope that layer hopping will be fixed... For Black Lotus and Chest reasons..
---
But honestly... I couldn't give less shits about the gurubashi trinket xD
---
It's going to be several months until BWL releases, let alone having the crossbow drop from chromaggus AND getting the loot over other hunters. Up until that point, you're using bows, and you'll do significantly more DPS than an Orc Hunter.
---
You're not picking talents for scrubs, but you seem to be taking talents for getting world first instead, not taking 1 point out of imp battle shout for piercing howl is silly, 99% of the playerbase are not min/maxing autists that are going to lose a spell that helps them pvp with their pve build just so they can do 0,02% more damage
---
That is such a fantastic enchant, I just wish that the quest was repeatable
---
&gt;2. Leeway was introduced as a method to mitigate latency/lag issues caused by the limited connection customers
---
Like spell batching and for some reason people want that. I personally think both are dumb and shouldnt be in classic.
---
Let's not forget Berserk as well.
---
Well done. 
---
Can't wait to see rogue.
---
they should've just been increasing lvl cap by 5 from the start, they would be reaching 100 next expansion. Which would be the original plan, since the game was only supposed to have 4 expansions. but that was before activision, when blizzard still had a creative integrity. also they hoped titan would work out
---
Well personally I would like to have a seasonal System similar to Diablo 3. Pretty much like that:
---
Classic release now and goes for lets say 2 years until everything is out and cleared. Then this whole Server gets copied (uve gotta choose by yourself). This copied Server transcends into TBC where everyone can bring their classic character or start a new one. The classic Server stays as it is on some Kind of "finished" Server. Meanwhile I new fresh Classic Server Releases.
---
So you would have 1 final classic Server, 1 fresh classic Server, 1 fresh TBC Server.
---
Everything goes for - lets go with it again - 2 years. After that period, the characters from the new classic Server gets transfered to the final classic one. Then this Server will transcend into TBC and a new classic Server opens. Meanwhile the TBC Server is final aswell and will stay as the completed TBC Server. Again data gets copied if wanted and youre allowed to transcend into WotLk. And the rest continues until whatever Expansion People would want to.
---
Like this there will always be one final Server and one fresh Server thats goes through Progression (I guess you could Change the time Frames a bit later on) and gets transfered.
---
100% sure this was a thing, did it all the time. Thats unfortunate if its not in (beta) Classic.
---
oh shit.  you realise we have to fight to the death now?  there can be only one
---
I agree, but they shouldn't delete them because they were here. But reduce them to a realistic delay
---
Of course it's possible, but the boredom of playing that horrible 1 button class
---
I know I won't be reading much of the quests, it gets tiring and boring for me.
---
However I will go into profession much harder than what I did back then! 
---
Looking forward to being able to do some raidings, back then I did go up to Naxxramas which was quite an accomplishment. I don't expect to be able to join this kind of guild tho, not enough play time.
---
Ohh yeah everything starts in level 1, with reputation towards other players :)
---
I think alot of vanilaplayers will spend some extra time getting to 60, just to be able to build up an atmospher for level 60, atleast ill do that.
---
I don't think anyone likes layering or the idea, but unless you want to wait all day for que it has to be in.  Don't know about you, but fuck that 4 hour que wait shit, even more than 4
---
lack of concience even in a game then u know what ur dealing with is either a child or a sad pathetic person...
---
Id still rather have a druid tank 5mans. Swipe and no mana breaks each pull
---
The imp will not slow you down unless you have no clue what you're doing. First of all im pretty sure (but i could be wrong) that the imp has more range than you. Pretty useful to tag mobs. Besides that you can use the imp on a mob while you do a cast on another one to try and tag 2 mobs. In the very early levels you can also just put curse of agony on a mob anf let the imp do the rest when you have to go and turn in a quest or vendor stuff. And you will also kill mobs faster in general anyway.
---
They’re alluding to the fact there’s not enough quests to hit 60, though you could definitely still have leftover quests.
---
You can but the amount of time you'd save skipping this quest is less than amount of extra down time you're going to incur from longer time to kill and downtime.
---

Unless you're planning to play at the most hardcore raiding level most of what you're worried about isn't insurmountable. 
---
There's no arenas either so while will of the forsaken/other PvP racials are a real pain in some situations it's not quite as game-winning as it would be in a competitive small group situation.
---
Changes
---
I was curious about this so looked him up on the wiki: apparently in patch 1.12.1 they added 'aoe slime bolts' to his berserk phase to stop people kiting. Wonder whether that will be in classic...
---
This time I'll progress past mc...
---
This is art
---
No
---
Welcome to business, rookie
---
Actually getting to 60 now I am not an altoholic.
---
Well it's based on 1.12 client.  I maintain that it's likely elite mob damage was higher before 1.12 and was nerfed sometime between 1.0 and 1.12.  This is the only thing that explains how much harder I remember dungeons like SM being - specifically on trash pulls.  Pulling like 4 mobs and tanking with a 2hander was simply not a thing in real vanilla when I leveled my first char (Warrior).  
---
People dismiss this as 'oh we were all bad back then, you're misremembering' and there's something to that but honestly not all of us were 8 year olds back then, I was 22 and had been playing mmos since 1997.  I knew how to gear my warrior, I knew how to use my abilities and the guild I was running dungeons with was mostly filled with 18+ year olds who had also come from DAoC which was arguably a much more hardcore min/max game than wow ever was. 
---
No, at this point I'm 90% certain that blizzard must have nerfed dungeon mob damage in an undocumented change between 1.0 and 1.12 since I would have been leveling in ~1.1 -&gt; 1.3/4 ish.
---
The problem is they've said themselves they dont have any of the data from before 1.12 so there's no way for this to be proved.  But in a lot of ways it is a shame because ideally if someone *could* prove the elite dungeon mob damage was lowered by 1.12 compared to launch then I think most people would want the launch numbers re-instated over the nerfed 1.12 numbers.
---
Selling Ice Cold Milk on christmas
---
You are right, it's a bit confusing. I'm ont entirely sure myself, but I do think, we'll get the final version, i.e. the spelldmg one, directly. 
---
The thing is, the pvp sets were reworked in 1.11. For some reason, the blue pvp sets were not updated, but new items with the same name were introduced, while the epic pvp sets were simply updated. I can't remember, whether this was actually the case in vanilla or it's just some sort of datamining bug. So, we'll have to wait and see until Phase 2 to be sure, but I'd say, it's much more likely, we get the spelldmg version of the set, as the epic set will have the spelldmg version.
---
Regardless, with 67 str, 34 agi, 20 int and 4% crit the old pvp set would be a pretty good choice as well. It's worse than the new version, but better than T1 anyday.
---
wrong... layering does not affect que in any way, its a method to evenly populate areas so the server can handle it better and areas appear more populated to the individual... but in the end this comes at a major cost called layer-abuse where players jump layers with intent to abuse and doing so is exceedingly easy but impossible to prevent...
---
they could easily host more servers rather than shard them, yes blizzard would have to pay a bit more to do this but lets be honest they arent gonna lack money from all the subs they get....
---
Wont warlocks be boring with the debuff limit? Dot management is what make the class fun imo.
---
My character fell through the world once. Took ages to get sorted given I needed a GM. 
---
Been terrified of it happening again ever since.
---
Is that John Bain in the thumbnail? God i miss that guy.
---

---
Thanks for the effort mate!
---
even if they have gnomish net, helmet, nades and nitro boots :D ?
---
correct, the only people voting for these retarded mechanics are people who desire to abuse them... and yes it would be abuse as the mechanics wherent added as part of the game but rather as a way for the server and client to communicate with the restrictions it had back then.
---
What's it to you piggy?
---
Same! When I was 16-18 I was always looking to fight people, now I'm 30 ish I just wanna play the game
---
I  have actually done this back in 05' 
---
after a couple of months of playing wow, I replayed the entire WC3 campaign just to get more intimate with the lore, and boy was it a treat to see all the areas and characters you just played in WC in all its WoW glory.
---
If you have the time,  I highly recommend doing it.
---
In my opinion, Troll Hunter.
---
If you need to choose between the two races, I'd take their racials into consideration, but not for the reasons one might think.
---
If you prefer the fantasy of being an excellent marksman/archer, then Troll is for you (because of Bow Specialization). If you feel sentimental toward your hunter pets or just really likes Beast Mastery and wishes it was viable, then pick Orc (because of 5% pet damage).
---
I hear that this was a thing back in vanilla anf i dont doubt it but i played vanilla and legit never saw that. Maybe i just didnt pay attention or was just clueless but i dont remember it.
---
It's easy.
---
1. It's gamebreaking
---
2. It didn't exist in vanilla
---
Having a real experience with what it was like, or as close to it. Does not have layering.
---
Layering is not very different from sharding and is one of the most idiotic implementations in a LIVE MMO (massive multiplayer).
---
How does splitting players (population) up make sense for a MMO?
---
&gt;Blizzard testing stuff making it look bugged for players. Only on the stress test server where they specified they will be fooling around with layering.. manually.
---
Ok, you're intentionally trolling. Bye.
---
They put a cooldown on it so far, so that helps
---
Agreed with the spell batching part for sure. Why people want artificial lag that makes the game feel clunky will never make sense to me.
---
If i wanted to feel content to not have to farm again for mc/bwl/aq/naxx i would need around 6000g or so, but i also use all the consumes and minmax to the point of overkill
---
!Remindme 55 days
---
That is also counting bijous for zg repp, and nature/frost ress gear, enchants etc
---
It's 3% hit versus raid bosses, not .3%. You won't be getting the chromaggus crossbow for months. It has to be added to the game first which will take several months, then you have to have it drop and then you have to get the crossbow before any other hunters in the raid. If you don't get it first time, you could be waiting another month to get a chance the second time, depending on how lucky you are. It doesn't really matter if bow speed isn't ideal compared to crossbows. You can replace 3 pieces of gear with ones that have better stats, as you no longer have to sacrifice anything for hit rating, which evens out the dps loss from bow&gt;crossbow. Plus, once you get Rhok'delar, you'll be making mince meat of bosses for months.
---
Don’t interfere with the process and let the dps die. They either learn or drop group. Problem solved
---
You must been living under a rock for a few years if you dont know discord. Not knowing discord right now is on the same level as not knowing what steam or twitch is wtf
---
100% with you on the animation up to a point that I will concidwr swapping my bow with a xbow or a gun
---
You can’t make good gold solely from pickpocketing, drop rates have been nerfed, vendor prices reduced not to mention resists.
---
You can make a bit extra while doing other things with it, that’s about it.
---
I mean, minimum you're gonna want enough gold for your mounts. So like 1.1k or so. 
---
However, there are tons of gold sinks in the game. Repair costs, food/drinks, respecs, etc. Not to mention end game consumable costs. Engineering PvP items. Some BoE items you're gonna want to buy for raids.
---
No amount of gold is enough. Keep going until you reach 214,784
---
Actually it was not supposed to work like that so I am fine as Rogue main with this change. Your spells will respond better way and you can always use your combo points 0,5 s before mob die, not after.
---
leeway is literally a mechanic meant to exist only when lag is preventing you to be within range but with it existing when no lag exists is literally adding extra range....
---
leeway without havey lag is equal to being able to loot a target before it has died... that is how broken the idea is in this day and age...
---
Not in stress tests
---
I get what you're saying, and if I was leveling solo I would obviously get the imp. But I don't think I need it with my strategy. Obviously I will test it during the next stress test.
---
You clearly have no idea what layering is, or why it’s implemented and needed.  
---
And no, I’m not going to enlighten you.  This exact point has been discussed atleast a hundred  different times this week alone.  Look at any one of the 20+ threads in the last 24 hours alone for more info.
---
Yes but where is your pooping schedule
---
More popular yes, but also more servers and layering which, from my experience on the stress test compared to a private server, is much less congested particularly if you know what you're doing and can get ahead of the pack.
---
Ditto. 40 to 50 is the slowest.
---
"Maybe feared players run slower"
---
Omegalul.
---
It'll speed you up 3 levels further down the line. between getting your imp and getting your voidwalker, there will be a huge void (pun intended) in your dps and survivability if you dont have your imp. the extra hour of corpse running will be offset by the time it takes you to get your imp. It's literally one of the key parts of your toolkit. It's like a shaman saying cba getting totems it takes too long...in fact probably has more impact than that
---
I'm not leveling solo and with my strategy, I don't think I will need the imp before voidwalker. I will test it during the next stress test
---
You never go full season 8
---
2h fury, can respec at 45 or 40 to arms. Sweeping strikes can be useful for picking up speed in lvling.
---
If I pick warr, I'm stuck between mage n warr, I'll be fury all the way til 60 I believe. Using imp slam with a swing timer
---
What's the point of having a RP PvP server if you're scared of PvP?
---
I'm not leveling solo but I will test it during the next stress test
---
Coming from a pserver, we are sick of leveling. So we are going to get it done as fast as possible.
---
This time will be the last and this time we won't have to worry about losing our characters ever again due to corrupt staff.
---
It's a question. No need to be aggressive. Leveling in vanilla is a quest on its own and it has its own appeal. Many people in this sub are all about rushing to 60 asap, while the reality is that it won't matter in the long run. This is going to be a game for 2+ years, getting to farm at 60 a couple of weeks more is not as important as people here make it out to be.
---
Fuck this is amazing lol
---
or they could do what they always do and scale it to an appropriate size
---
This is good to know since as a more casual player I now know I can be happy just aiming to get enough for my epic mount. 
---
Apparently you don't need to be hardcore minmaxing to clear MC which is my main goal so will probably do fine just farming whenever I feel like it.
---
I want to try and level a warrior too but I fear the repair costs will keep be bankrupt on that character lol.
---
No amount of gold is ever enough... I can't give you a number for Vanilla as I wasn't really active in the raiding scene.  
---
Although during TBC I was pretty hardcore and mostly had a constant amount of 1.5-2.0k gold on me which was more than sufficient. Keep in mind that gold was easier to come by than during Vanilla.  
---
I ended the expansion with about 5.5k and felt pretty rich. During the following expansion we got the first repair mount for 20K.   
---
Long story short, if you have around 2k on you at all time in Vanilla you are pretty much set. Having 400-1000 on you at all time, you are doing good. But then again I remember people raiding who where not able to repair all their gear at the same time... As long as you are able to buy consumables for a week or two in advance and not grind any additional income and not dip under 100g you'll be fine.
---
Well even if you level in a group at least as undead you can probably do the quest while your mates do the other ones without having to be outside of the range to get credit for the other quests too. Skipping the voidwalker would make a lot more sense IMO since everyone would have to wait for you.
---
Was it at least accurate?
---
No one wants you to tell them how to play the game piggy.
---
Started playing on Alliance and in BGs I legit found the horde to be pretty scary for a while.
---
First of all, how could anybody know the answer to this? Second, they’ll have cross realm BG’s, so queue times should be very fast to near instant for both factions.
---
Lets discuss
---
25%chance to resist stuns
---
Attack speed
---
I wonder when Ill take stuns and when Ill be dpsing the entire time...
---
Stop being lazy
---
As people have said, Tanking UBRS is easy and doesnt require that much gear, and some of the items on your list wont exist/wont be easily accessible at the start like don julios and corehound leather kits etc etc.  
---
But lets see, these are items you shouldn't use because they are way to bad.  
---
 Stoneform Shoulders (688 armor, 7 def) Change them to **Spaulders of Valor** way better stats (or anything with high stamina + stats, if you're afraid of tanking UBRS)  
---
 Cloak of Warding (214 armor, 5 def)  Change to  **Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape** also way better stats.  
---
 Magically Sealed Bracers  (383 armor, 3 def)  Change to either **Bracers of Valor** or **Vigorsteel Vambraces**  
---
These items are horrible choices for any sort of tanking. It seems like your devalueing stats way to much when in reality Armor is only good when you have also have alot of health. They kinda scale together.  
---
Also defense is pretty overrated in general, It offers poor mitigation and you much rather just have high armor stamina/stat gear, and have some base defense maybe like 380 max, then rest of the time you just keep your shield block up on **EVERY** Cooldown. And you're very seldom going to get either crushed or critical striked. And the points you put in fury is entirely wasted something like this for a new tank is way better:   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZmZxizseMdVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZmZxizseMdVo)
---
Yeah we do.
---
It would be even easier and faster to finish the quest quickly with a friend. The quest is so simple, its right where you want to be anyway. In my opinion its silly to skip it.
---
But your question has been answered, it is possible to skip quests.
---
Autism
---
respecs alone is 100g a week presuming you want to raid and pvp in different specs.
---
I don't think you understand what the word scam means
---
Depends on the economy of the server, I was sitting on 900g while raiding AQ40 and had enough to last around a month without farming at that point.
---
I would rather have a paladin tank or a druid tank in any dungeon, any day, over a warrior. I find warriors WAY to slow (majority of times) for 5-mans.   Just sayin :P
---
Wrath was where classes really started to bland together though
---
Wholesome
---
The issue is the same. The game was not designed for the number of people that would show up.
---
The solution is also the same. Make a mirror of the game that is on the same server so you can make space for everyone.
---
The problem is the implementation, which is abusable and causes balance issues.
---
Changing layers should be clear and defined, with a number and a cooldown. That's all.
---
Attacking the merits of EQ is unrelated, and it's also the direct ancestor of and responsible for much of wow. It pioneered the genre as it is today.
---
Dear retard then allow me to enlighten you by using blizzards own words for you better to comprehend things...
---
&gt;Imagine a tray with an empty glass. The tray is a single server in *WoW Classic*. The empty glass is a layer. When you log into the game on launch day, you’ll be with a flood other players: the water that we’re going to pour into the glass. Once the glass is full, we add another empty glass and start filling it up with water, or players, too. Each new glass is a new layer that consists of two to three thousand players — which means any single server could handle tens of thousands of players at the same time but without all of them being crowded into the same place in-game. The only way to see players from another layer is to group up with them —otherwise they don’t interact.
---
These are blizzards very own words, players within layers can freely move around and each layer has its own spawns of rares, chests and mining/herbalism nodes. this allows anyone to jump between these layers at will once in a spot that has a spawn they desire and rather than wait or get lucky with rng they would start jumping layers and significantly increase their odds at finding said rare npc, chest or a lotus...
---
Reason this lowers que is becourse blizzard wont have to worry about server traffic/stress too much since they can better control population in a zone, back in the original vanilla blizzard where forced to create WSG as counter to high pop gathering in a single location. Blizzard in no way lacks the money to setup and buy extra servers so this que you retards speak of only exists if blizzard where to be negligent...
---
If you could not jump between layers then things wouldnt be an issue but then there would be no meaning behind calling them layers either, furthermore having that high a population destroys what classic was about...
---
classic was about the social aspect as well as the farm but this layering idea conceived by retards and upvoted by retards is the essence that destroys a game...
---
sadly we have people such as you who are unable to think for themselves and only listen and believe to the first thing they hear... often reffered to as lemmings or blind sheep...
---
When did I tell anyone how to play the game, smartass? Point me to it.
---
how long ? if its 5 or 15 min. it wont help much.
---
&gt; No. I played in vanilla.
---
&gt; Also, it’s laughable you don’t realize how off you are.
---
How can I be "off" when I am only asking you a question, which you can't answer?
---
in business you do not make such "obvious" shady moves... first sold product would already reveal that ur a crook...
---
Maybe it is because of pronunciation?
---
When you say "For the Horde", the "the" sounds a bit rough \[thuh\], although when it comes to "For the Alliance" it is softer \[thee\].
---
\[faw thuh hawd\] vs \[faw thee  uh·lai·uhns \]
---
IMO Alliance sounds a bit awkward :P
---
English is not my native language, and I can be wrong, so please correct me :)
---
Cooking and fishing at 300/300 - I never managed to do it on any characters.
---
AH is just another form of PvP.
---
It's a video game, get over it.
---
Ret / Rogue was great in later seasons 2v2. Not top tier, but at least better than some common duos like druid warr.
---
To be fair, the OP is just voicing an opinion. I don’t see him trying to tell anyone how to play the game
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=12794](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12794)  but only 3 targets
---
Nooooh!  I wanna be the best, i i do what i can ;P
---
sounds like the perfect way to make a balance-druid-focused tier 1, feral-dps-focused-tier 1, bear-tank-focused-tier 1, resto-druid-focused-tier 1, make variants for current gear for the different specs (since current tiers are usually geared towards one of the specs). A lot of specs would probably be usable given properly stated gear.
---
- Troll only needs +6 Hit (all other races +9) to cap
---
- Bow specialisation
---
- Berserker
---
Makes trolls the best race choice on horde side, when you really want to min/max. 
---
But Orc/Tauren are fine to play. Hunter isn't one of the top DDs anyway after MC. They are in raids for their utility. So I would just choose the race I like most.
---
I had a Tauren Hunter Rank 11 during Vanilla btw.
---
I don't know how long, but it's a step in the right direction I guess.
---
Raid bosses drop a decent amount of gold, which can help offset repairs. If your guild has a raid down pat you can make money.
---
Someone who has clearly been scammed before.
---
Yeah, but that's if we bother to do quests with all the competition. I'll see on the stress test
---
Omegalmao
---
This is done purely to prevent dead servers when tourists leave, not to limit congestion. The quote explains HOW it works, not WHY.
---
Imagine being this much of an edgelord you write a post this long just to showcase you don't understand basic context.
---
Yikes!
---
I'm not leveling solo, I still have to test this strategy. I'm going to get the imp eventually, just not during the huge flood of people at launch
---
How can you possibly be that low, Exalted with your Faction capitals is ridiculously easy since 3.1 when the dungeon rep tabards came out.
---
I 100% agree but Bandwith |= Ping. A 1GBits Connection does not give you a better ping. The traffic while playing WoW is like 5KB/s...
---
fuck sake you're sad
---
Are you trying to order in bulk over at susanexpress dot com?
---
You will literally get the skulls you need while in Deathknell killing everything for the quests. You only need 3.
---
Why on Earth would you skip it when you'll be doing other quests that require killing the exact same mobs?
---
What on Earth?
---
Plus he's easily a huge DPS boost to anyone, party or not, at any level.
---
WTF.
---
My Dad will level my hunter to 60 while i level on my 2nd account my future main (Warrior). :D
---
As long as you can afford flasks and essential consumables for the week, repairs and some extra, you are good.
---
And that ranges from 200g to 1,000g / week, depending on the guild.
---
If you get it that way you truly didn't earn it. Noone else will know, but you would know your title is a fraud.
---
All I needed
---
Isn’t it just Frozen Throne? That’s probably why if I’m not mistaken.
---
Honestly i dont care that much this time around what i didnt get to see back then.
---
I didnt get to clear naxx back then but this time around i just look forward to enjoying levelling and having a good time with similar minded ppl.
---
omg man, i was looking for this video for over 2 years..
---
Enough to respec 6 times a week and afford pots, so however much gives you the potential to make 500g a week profit on the auction house. That extra 200g a week go into the savings account to pay for any BOE epics you fancy. 5000g should be a good starting point.
---
Really? Druid were perfectly fine tanks in TBC? my guild had me and another prot pal, 2 druids and 1 warrior and we cleared everything
---
Having windfury totem on horde is a blessing and a curse, you do so much damage and can rocket up the threat meter, then have to literally stop even white damage as that alone with windfury is causing you to over-threat.
---
Salv would of been nice. I spent a lot of time in fights twiddling my thumbs
---
&gt;During vanilla, **all the way through TBC ** and most of WotLK
---
damn, I didnt know reading was so hard, lmao
---
Troll is always the right answer.
---
Those 3 guilds that did that man, they sure shaped the whole game lmao
---
I don't know why, but more than any other class I remember Paladins being raid leaders in classic.
---
The raids. I was 12 back in Vanilla. I was so engrossed in the world that I leveled pretty darn slow. Didn't start raiding until TBC
---
I may be getting old finally.. I had to look up what edgelord was. I know the comment wasn't to me, but I was like wtf is an edgelord?  lol
---
First few months will be clean, then in the midle of AQ preparations they will add mount shops etc, then after naxx release they will go all in with lvl boost etc. I hope that im wrong, but im almost sure this will happen
---
The tank experience.
---
I was healer back then fulltime and never got to do anything other, even in pvp.
---
Yea, it's pretty evident that there're more minmaxers out there than there were before in vanilla (or it is much more vocal crowd now) but let everyone play the way they want. It's an old game and some people have explored it already so they rather try reach maximum potential with all the knowledge they now have. There will still be some casuals who look the game through different lenses and you can decide who do you spend most of your time with but you can't force others to act certain way.
---
I've come to terms with that there are more tryhards this time around who could possibly nickpick about the smallest things. However, I'm still in a favorable situation as I may play a bit sub optimally and still be seek after because I like healing a lot and my favorite classes are priest and druid. I'm horde so the minmaxing crowd isn't choosing the race for me.
---
You don't need engineering until max level. Id level with tailoring then drop it when you crafted your items.
---
How is this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgotxGt00h for a PvP/pve imp conc build.
---
I know imp judgement is not very work the talents.
---
What about imp Devo and toughness Vs redoubt and shield spec? Which would be better utilised?  Imp Devo is like 100 armours right? Which is awful.
---
I'm working on the assumption someone else is buffing might. Thanks.
---
English is not mandatory in german schools. If germans want to learn english then they have to do so by their own will, which most people simply won't do. I have a german friend who's 26 years old, and I spoke better english when I was 10 than he does now,  because I learned it in school. I could be wrong but I don't think France teaches english either. That's the main issue here. This will lead to big divides on all servers, with dedicated german/french guilds who simply exist within their own world because they can't interact very well with the rest of the server. It definitely sucks more for those guys than for us, but it will still cause issues for both parties.
---
you are the guy that thinks he can sleep for 30 hours and then be 30 hours awake. Sleep doesn't add up.
---
Man, you're implying I'm gonna be doing the other quests
---
Imps what makes warlock the fastest leveling class 1-10, why the hell would you skip a couple kills for a 30% faster kill speed on everything pre level 10.
---
I can't remember a single time where I would consider it a fair fight, usually it was either a group killing everything in sight, a one/twoshot from a lvl skull player or someone attacking when you are already engaged with a mob. I'm sure it happens sometimes, but it is the exception in my experience.
---
Oh my god the builds that would open up. [MD/Ruin with Succ talents?](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/-205030312251105-50500251020001)
---
We have this post every day. Layering isn't going to change. It's only going to be at the beginning of phase 1 for the massive influx of players at launch.
---
Skinning for cash and tailoring for shadoweave and those BiS items you mentioned.
---
At lvl 51 you have 1/3 of your total 1-60 experience remaining.
---
I think you're a bit pessimistic for your 50 to 60 leveling time compared to the 1-50.
---
I know you probably don't want to give out your strategy, but do you have any advice for a F R E S H server?
---
1. Layering I think is needed but they should think it out more so it can't be exploited in the same way. Not for farming in high level zones, reusing nodes, chest in STV etc.
---
2. Leeway should go for sure. From everything I have read about it it sounds like it will make the game clunky. Not as smooth as on private servers or like it was back in the day. Have seen it demonstrated( was on some podcast or video, don't have the link) that the leeway they have now is not working the same as back in the day. 
---
Stuff like warrior hamstring kiting for example doesn't work very well with leeway even though you might think   
---
it should. The hitbox is to big. Also it promotes using backpedal since that doesn't trigger the leeway.   
---
Backpedaling is clunky and not smooth as strafe. I don't want to have backpedal as part of kiting mobs or   
---
players. Makes no sense that if you backpedal everything is working like it should but if you strafe or run then   
---
here comes the leeway.
---
A few hours a day for how many weeks? 
---
I don't think the average person can play for a few hours each day. The average person who will be playing Classic will be of working age, many with a family and other responsibilities.
---
&gt;wrong... layering doesn’t affect queues in anyway
---
I point out you clearly have no idea how layering works.  In your response to that:
---
&gt;reason this lower queue...
---
Lmao
---
There was the other part about how layering is supposed to make areas feel more populated as well... just take a step back and think about this for a couple mins.  
---
The best was the ‘Dear retard’ part tho.
---
Oh the irony! 
---
And then you go on to call me a lemming or blind sheep because I disagree with your ignorant, poorly thought out argument for why they should just implement more servers and remove layering.  
---
I’ll take layering for a couple of weeks over an over-abundance of servers at launch that results in half of them being dead / low pop by November.
---
Booking a week's worth of leave for a game isn't great though is it? Like it's going to be 1/4 of your annual leave so it's not saying a lot to use it on this.
---
Shadow hunter ftw
---
For the imp quest needs you to kill mobs (the sceletons around the abandoned blacksmith building) to loot 4 items. That's all. In return you get the imp with fire ball for some DPS and bloodpact a few levels up.
---
You can skip it, the voidwalker quest is still available on level 10. But in my opinion you're slowe without the imp.
---
I took that as an example, because it is well documented. It is harder to find stuff about guilds that were not racing for worldfirsts, but still competitive.  A lot of mages put on dust, because people rerolled after finding put they were mediocre in tbc etc...there was always minmaxing
---
i am sure there will be casual guilds in classic as there were casual guilds back then that did not care.
---
Those guilds that did not man, they sure shaped the whole game lnao
---
I'd like Classic+ content like OSRS does
---
Warriors go out the window without tanking? Lol are you serious? They are the best dps I'm reading and are very strong in PvP, they are the only class that can actually use all 3 of their talent specs.
---
I'd pick up skinning and tailoring during leveling and then drop skinning for engineering at 60.
---
Spot on, on so many levels
---
(My main since vanilla is a tauren enh shaman), HYPE LETS GO BACKK!!!
---
Enormous tip here for raiding warlocks :
---
Go to the empty town in western duskwood and use detect invisibility.
---
You will see a load of non aggressive level 51 ghosts with low health to farm shards on.
---
Even for a horde lock travelling here to farm them is the fastest way to get loads, I used to fill a 26 and 28 slot shard bag (which happens very fast) with them to store in the bank so I always had loads for raids.
---
Not many know about this so there's no competition and nowone who will attack you.
---
Also when you're done if you're horde you can go slightly north and get lots of ganking done in a place that isn't near an alliance flight path so there are no repercussions
---
Going Enhancement, mostly because it's more interesting than warrior imo, and partly to piss off the elitist in our 10 player friend group. 🤘 See you on the battlefield. For the Horde!
---
Right the good fight, my man. Attendence is on hell of a raid boss
---
On the upside you can tab out and watch a movie in between mob kills
---
Thanks dude this is very helpful!
---
Yeah it really sucked for me when I got kicked out of my guild for playing a druid because literally the only reason we were wiping at onyxia was the lack of pure priest healing.. damn, if only we had that 100 extra hps!!  
---
Also I remember that one guy in my guild in wotlk.. he put one suboptimal gem on his gear, let me tell you got hardkicked quicker than we downed marrowgar that night  
---
I mean its honestly literally impossible to progress on normal 10 man in wotlk without an optimal raid comp.. im sure we'd be up there fighting for world firsts if just John would reroll.. god damn it
---
Agree completely.  The pick system for EQ’s TLP servers has been refined over the years and works fantastically.
---
NO, I AM ~~ALPHAR~~ GRAVIOUS!!
---
Are there any news about reforged? It‘s my second most hyped game after classic. The website still doesn‘t have any nightelfs
---
unless your guildmates are lazy fucks you do not need many shards. 
---
use drain soul on trash and keep a full 20-28 bag of shards and you are golden. normally.
---
Gnomish has several advantages in pvp(deathray, shrink machine) and for physical in pve(battle chicken), goblin has none of that but you want some goblins to craft shit, so having a non pvp caster in guild craft goblin stuff is really nice.
---
Oh damn, is that top shelf from frostmourne? You guys coming to classic aswell then?
---
quickest way is just getting them for free. Skips the Ah part.
---
Sadly it is akso the most ublikely way \*sniff\*
---
Unarmoured horse and nightsaber for my Chars ...
---
There's plenty of players that don't minmax, you just have confirmation bias because you fear minmax and lots of people are talking about it. Of course they are talking about it, this is a place to discuss classicwow, obviously minmaxers will talk about their minmaxing here, and trust me we have a lot to say. That makes it look like the entire community is about minmaxing, but it isn't.
---
Keep in mind that you need 300 Tailoring to get the 2% crit chance set bonus from the Bloodvine gear.
---
Unless I change my mind again I'll be maining Warlock and I'm gonna echo two other commenters here, I am probably going tailoring/skinning for leveling. Later at 60 once I have more funds I might switch skinning out for engineering.
---
I'm not here to argue if it's healthy or not. It probably isn't.
---
I'm just here to say that it's shitty to call someone, or something, "sad" because you don't align with that persons values. Specifically if it's a reply to a post about the guy sharing his passion. It's just a useless comment.
---
I hope the OP knows what he's doing and knows how to keep a healthy enough lifestyle while pursuing his passion. 
---
Seeing how organized this all is, gives me the feeling that he does.
---
you're giving pigs everywhere a bad name right now
---
I've been feeling the same way and then I just realized that I'm not part of the private server community and my experience with vanilla wow had nothing to do with wanting to be efficient at gold making, topping DPS charts, being the best dueler, etc. You just need to stop reading forum posts and just pick a class you like just because you like it, whether its because of class fantasy, looks, gameplay mechanics, fun factor, etc.
---
I just made a decision that I'm going shadow priest because mind flay and shadowform for example look really good and satisfying in my eyes and the class fantasy speaks to me, regardless of all the noise about only 1 shadow priests in raids, 0 shadow priests in premade pvp, etc.
---
Anathema / Benediction. I've mained Shadow Priest since TBC (Created a Blood Elf and stuck ever since). I played a Paladin in Vanilla but never hit 60, so really looking forward to getting stuck into the quest line.
---
It takes years to learn that speedleveling is the best way I'd say.
---
My first character took 13 days played to hit 60. now I'm at 10+ and yeah I try to level fast because that keeps it interesting.
---
Stop judging.
---
Everything wrong with modem day MMOs.

Rank 14 weapons may disagree. For some, it is literally impossible for that rank without the help.
---
I assume he was talking about competitive pokemon with is very much min maxing
---
I play competetive, you can compete just fine without minmaxing. The overall strategy is more important than minmaxing, just like in wow.
---
RP and PvP does not go well together as the past has proven.  
---
give the opposite faction the ability to interfer with RP event and god knows they will.  
---
if you want to PvP on RP realm then there is always flagging.
---
When I tank and ask if my heals are good on mana- I just get “pull more” - while they’re like on zero. Makes me nervous having a healer on empty. Prolly just me tho.
---
Yeh sure incel, not wanting stupid playable panda bears makes you 90% racist hahahahaha
---
I don't know about you but I absolutely hate sleeping in daylight, so I will be trying to sleep in the evening. I don't think it really matters in terms of population anyway since if you play 30+ hours on launch, YOU WILL BE ALONE.
---
Improved Devo changes the armor value from 735 to ~920 armor. 
---
Except for clothies that is irrelevant and they will prefer improved concentration aura.
---
I would go redoubt it's superior for everything except being the ultimate raid slave.
---
And like he said, dwarf is better on all accounts, provide some backup to your claims instead of us having to take your word for it.
---
In a duel or 1v1 a hunter loses almost every single time unless you play dwarf again a rogue, you will get sapped, blinded, stunned into oblivion, slow poisoned and rediculed for not playing dwarf.
---
If the rogue gets somehow out of stealth from flare or gets trapped, its his own freakin fault for not using stuff at his disposal and is not the norm when it comes to good rogue.
---
You cannot use shadowmeld in combat, and you will not be able to since you will always be in combat against a good rogue, and no rogue is going to engage you if you stealth ontop of your freezing trap in shadowmeld, that's just stupid, they will wait it out accordingly and sap your ass, while killing your pet.
---
Private server fools need to sit down.
---
I will play paladin when vanilla release and I've tried to decide if i should play human or dwarf. people talk alot about stoneform. I can purify diseases and posions so the only real profit of it would be 10% armor and the bleeds.
---
My question is if it's worth to roll dwarf to have the stoneform or go human and get rep, wep experties and stealth detection for pvp
---
The amount of mental hoops rpers will go to to justify their nelf priest pick
---
Holy shit you turn with your mouse kill me .
---
Why would he roll on an NA server rather than a European one?
---
And are toughness or precision worth it?
---
Same goes for me. I would not call myself a gamer because the only game I played for more than 2 hours straight was vanilla/tbc/wotlk. Never got hooked by any other franchise
---
RP-PvP invites too many trolls.  
---
not happening. not required either.
---
who ever joins an RP server probably has his main focus on RP. otherwise there is not much reason to.  
---
the PvP part can be detrimental to the RP experience so its only logical to seperate both. RP is mainly faction internal or PvE.
---
Rpers are about to EXPLODE with anger
---
scrap outland imo. Nothing came out of it anyways, the burning legion ended up being a huge disappointment through retail. Just keep it on one planet, I don't think that's too much to ask.
---
Seeing as holy is the only viable spec dwarf is better. Stone form &gt; rep. It is useful for both PvP and pve.
---
Reread comment
---
I don't know how people are confused about this. If you are located in Norway and want to connect to a Oceania server, no amount of bandwidth will save you from lag
---
No u
---
If you're respeccing 6 times a week you chose the wrong class
---
Why would you want to boost some shitters when you can have a full guild of good players?
---
My old boss used to let his 5 year old kid play - he'd hide the interface and tell him which button to press to get on the horsey and what to do if the screen goes black and white. The kid would then randomly ride around AV for hours, every Saturday morning. Kid had a great time, boss got honor and rep. Win/win for everyone except the other alliance.
---
Crafted what exactly? Maybe robe of the void early if you farm it but bloodvine set bonus requires tailoring to activate.
---
not giving many fucks. if any at all.
---
for real, thats exactly how I played 2005, only the reason was different.  
---
in the past I got too hung up on arbitrary ingame achievements or irrelevant goals instead of just enjoying myself.  
---
this time I'll be playing with no real goal in mind and go whereever the game takes me.
---
You can level without competition for 15, allying exploration, shipping quest and some grinding for mobs that are not in any quests. And then you're ahead of the pack.
---
You dont need to be gnomish to use them, just to craft them
---
Hope you get it. It's a really great feeling when that fight comes together, like clockwork.
---
I'm one small step ahead of you in that we never got Sapphiron down, at the time that fight felt almost impossible to me as a hordie (although I'm aware some horde guilds have downed him of course).
---
So much frost damage, everywhere, we were going oom all over the place and frost resist gear and pots didn't seem to be helping much.
---
no layering
---
Or you can just have an alt-banker or two
---
But you will have plate armor and a shield no? im just thinking that you will have alot of armor already. If you were going priest then yes it would make a big difference or am i missing something?
---
Regarding robes. I'm halfway there to writing a paladin fashion guide. 
---
While I like to heal in PvE nobody will make me wear that baron dress or the floozy piece from AQ. 
---
In the end the most visible pieces of armor ar shoulders, helmet and   cloak.
---
You can hide cloak and helmet and your chest can be hidden behind a fashionable tabard. But shoulders and robes will ruin your class fantasy and for me my enjoyment. 
---
D1 shoulders have acceptable int and look good. No reason to pick some ugly cloth pieces that give plenty of uselees spirit and acceptable levels of +healing. 
---
For the chest theres are quite a few drops that give stupid amounts of int but regarding + healing DM and a rather expensive craftable mail chest.
---
If you never want to heal or tank, you have these classes to choose from: mage, warlock, rogue, hunter. You can play many of the hybrid classes as dps, but you should be at least ready and able to heal/tank. 
---
Then you got to look at the viable classes and weigh which of their weaknesses/strengths you prefer. 
---
There's a reason mages and rogues are overplayed. But it's not like locks and hunters sucks to play, it depends more on what type of gameplay you like.
---
or maybe because we’re not looking for a perfect game, we’re just looking for classic. It’s not a remaster.
---
it’s just hilarious to me how upset people get and the mental hoops they’ll jump through to justify a suboptimal choice. Your response only makes it even more hilarious. If you want to play a race for looks play it for looks, but don’t try to justify it like there’s some other reasons when it’s clearly worse.
---
Alliance warlocks will be in demand in raids! With so many horde going orc for the stun resist as well I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
In classic this might work, but not when un have an AH mount Yak/Mammoth
---
Sounds like we are going to have to entertain a good old fashioned underwear off
---
That was my understanding too.
---
I haven't seen anything from Blizzard stating that there will be progressive itemisation. Just that NEW items added in late patches, (i.e. Diana's Pearl Necklace) won't be in from the start.
---
Any item in the game is in the final 1.12 itemisation state.
---
Yeah, go for it, don't listen to the haters. 
---
Don't expect people to bring you to groups though. 
---
Same thing applies to retadins and stuff.
---
There's a door that requires a key right as you enter the spire, past that door lies the upper part. Most ppl are too lazy to do the key quest themselves (iirc it's just killing 3 bosses in the lower blackrock spire) so they pay a 6th party member to just come along to open the door and then leave.
---
When i played vanilla, i was 12, and stacked intellect over spell power as a mage. Yet i still had a place in raids.
---
You are overthinking it.
---
 Only a very minority of guilds or player will care about that min maxing in pve, and chances that you wont be playing with them.
---
I feel like the opposite, school was the ideal time for me to be 40man raiding, but now as an adult with a wife and a job, 40 man raids are less possible.
---
Armor is negligible. Removing poisons and bleeds are fantastic Vs rogues hunters warriors ferals in PvP and in aq40 and naxx in pve. For example in maexxna, viscidus, loatheb or cthun or such fights, stone form is OP.
---
My lord! Spare me for I am but a humble noob.
---
There were no 40mans in TBC either.
---
Another thing that is relevant (especially for shaman): move ahead! There's no reason for a healer to just stand in the back on the last mob of a pull. Move to the melee or even ahead, drop fresh totems then start drinking as soon as combat drops.
---
Of course that requires a little bit of knowledge (patrols and pulling technique) to not accidentally pull or to not mess up the next LoS pull.
---
Compare logs in a few months?
---
What's a NEET?
---
Interesting read.  On private servers I always did devilsaur for a fairly quick epic mount.  I think you’re right that it’s going to be overly contested, so I’m thinking about some of the straight up farming you’re talking about here.  I’m wondering about herbalism though.  I’m wondering if the nodes are going to be pretty much permanently camped from the high populations.  Also wondering if the layering of zones with mean more nodes and water down the prices from market saturation.
---
you can already do that with purify, it removes diseases and posions. Sure still help vs bleeds but it only lasy 8 seconds with 180second cd.
---
oddly enough there are usually more paladins than priests.  
---
druids are not played much cause people do not enjoy the playstyle.  
---
playing druid well is too stressfull for most. I don't think their overall performance ingame is the deciding factor here. after all they do pretty damn fine in the right hands.
---
Hahaha we obviously had the same torrent ! Taylor gang !
---
maybe you shouldnt have run out of mana then
---
So, exactly like the Polish (insert other nationality) language guilds/communites that exist and have existed on English servers since forever?
---
No problem. Also the amount of time its going to take to travel back to do the quest later is going to take longer than just doing the quest at level 1.
---
Engineering is always good ofc, the second proff is up to you though, tailoring gives robe of the void and bloodvine set bonus, but you can just use robe of winter night early on instead and level it later on when zg is actually out. Probably depends on the effort you’re going to go to for it, if you just want easy money with low effort just go mining or herbalism, can do that and do wpvp while there’s no bgs in p2.
---
My last private server priest levelled as Holy, starting with 5/25/5.  It was reasonably fast, anything under 6 days is good enough for me.  You just need to buy a lot of water at the higher levels.  The difference is that the 1.12 talents are much better than the original priest talents.  In the old talents priests did not get spell damage from the holy tree.
---
fwiw, my first wow character was a resto druid.  It was astonishingly slow from 50-60.  I had to grind the last few levels as I didn't know where all of the the quests were, silithus was not really in the game, and there were not many people around to do dungeons.  I don't regret levelling as resto though, as the original cat form did pathetic damage anyway.
---
Put on the dress.
---
There will be more on qctuao lunch, so lets just hope.
---
Stone form while you purify someone else is fantastic in poison heavy fights when they really stack up. Or to remove a really heavy dot like spiders before maexxna. Or to make cthuns nature attack do 0 damage to you etc.
---
Another thing to consider warrior/paladins can wear all armor and a lot of weapon types (if you want to dress them fancy). Paladin also has a heal to spam if you're bored!
---
That'll depend on how quickly you'll be taking down mobs.
---
Even if they die quick you're probably going to be pulling multiples so having that imp throwing some fire blasts is probably still going to be worth it.
---
Maybe trial it on a private server? Though I think we'll probably have a short period of open beta for Classic before it launches.
---
"Life has many boars, Horde boys!"
---
Unless if you respec for 150g yes that's also an option.
---
4. Enough Bear-Tanks who are willing to tank to gear up for MC.
---
Buy at least 5k gold as soon as possible.
---
&gt;it’s just hilarious to me how upset people get and the mental hoops they’ll jump through to justify a suboptimal choice.
---
I hope you are aware that its you who is lumping over everyone as mentally rentarded, unable to raid in any professional setting at all, and even categorizing the whole group of roleplayers as unable to play "seriously".
---
I dont know what to tell you man, but seriously. Reflect a bit.
---
U'll have difficulties logging in for first few days at 19:00hrs. I would highly recommend changing sleeping schedule for 14:00-24:00 first night and then 18:00-02:00 for the rest of the week
---
Dude this comment legitimately made my day and it just woke up
---
Friggin' wild, dude. I don't remember you but it was a looong time ago. I was Illimin, a gnome rogue.
---
It stands for 'Not in Education, Employment or Training'
---
You see it thrown around 4chan a lot.
---
What?...
---
Being full t0 still shows dedication, and there will be raiding guilds who respect that!
---
The mage may have used a trinket or a talent before starting the frost bolt. So it is absolutely worth to cancel their cast if you can. And they need to use an aoe effect to get you out of stealth as well.
---
Bgs are cross realm
---
Someone linked a picture of his guild waiting outside the KT room and the majority of the priests in the raid where actually nelf lol think there was just 1 dwarf
---
Look leveling guides, avoid the guide areas and path? Grind mobs that are ideally not early quest mobs?
---
It's really about getting out of the start areas asap and getting your quest on sooner.
---
Thanks! :)
---
&gt; Oh no I have a life that means I can cheat to achieve things because else it isn't possible
---
A rogue talked about it on the beta, it isnt in
---
Ive done it in less than a week, i think i can decide  for myself how i line to level.. I didnt tell anyone to lvl a specific way, read the text again plz
---
I ended up deciding on gnome rogue thanks to p servers, I would have been undecided for ages otherwise
---
I suppose you’ve never killed a mob with a sinister strike crit lol. No but seriously, if it was in vanilla wow but isn’t in classic wow isn’t it a change. By the same logic spell batching shouldn’t be in classic because it’s not suppose to work like that
---
In case a hunter happens to read this, pets should despawn at about 100yds or so, at least if you zoom out the minimap to max they should despawn if you and pet are opposite sides of it.
---
I guess it all depends
---
I get 6 weeks annual leave per year and i have a fair bit banked. I only use between 2-3 weeks a year. 
---
My manager was about to ask me to take some for staff fatigue.
---
I dont think its silly. I get to take time off to do two neet weeks. Hang out with my wife and kid at home and play wow.
---
Spell batching was also corrected. Bring back RIP N DICE for my fellow brothers!
---
Not enough for raids though and it’s based on chance
---
!remindme 80 days
---
Even if the debuff limit was increased affliction would do worse dps and people would not take you anyway. The Dots don't scale with crit at all and their dps is worse as shadow bolt anyway
---
 lean back and enjoy, dont stress
---
This is really interesting. What's the deal with these ghosts? Is there a lore explanation for why they are there? Sounds pretty cool.
---
I would go tailoring+skinning or depending on how crowded it is( layering should make it much better) maybe herbalism( mining is an option too but herbalism should be better). A gathering profession is nice on a warlock or a hunter. While the pet fights you gather. Hunter and Warlock are Just wrecking balls of efficiency for gathering and leveling.
---
This picture is the mkst exciting gameplay moment of Hunter from 0 to 60
---
Haha fuck me who are you people. What did you guys do back in classic?
---
Honestly leeway is a necessary evil. I do not want two weeks holiday to be for absolutely nothing as ten thousand people fight over 8 boars or wolves.
---
What we need is an absolute commitment that leeway will be limited to 1-25 zones or even better, gone after a few weeks.
---
I can only assume some larger issue is preventing that but a launch without shared starts is just going to ruin the experience for damn near everyone just for the sake of people being stubborn. The server cap is higher and the game more popular, deal with it.
---
So reputation is one of the things i am a little unclear on. If I'm level 60 and do the low level quests will  I still get the rep? My main grind for rep was the Thorium brother hood. Still think I have PTSD over that one. All to get the fire resist plans. Made myself a small fortune from that but man did it take ages.
---
So your motivation for #1 is #nochanges but your motivation for #2 is #changes? I'm confused...
---
yes. simply click the "mage" icon (looks like a staff) on the character select screen.
---
As others has said then hunters can farm it easily for fast gold. But princess drops a ring which is really good for rogue, warriors and feral druids. So as a hunter you can take 10-20g for a boost run where the druid or rogue just follows you in stealth. Its a bit harder with a warrior as you have to kill all the mobs, but the mobs arent hard, it just takes time which would lower the gold per h.
---
Honestly probably a lot less!
---
Yes definitely but the main thing to take into account is that it's a big gold sink.
---
Levelling engi after you get your epic mount is recommended. Do Skinning and Mining while you level up and work towards saving gold for your epic mount (if you want it that is) you can then switch skinning for engi. Doing engi while levelling will likely make it hard for you to even get your level 40 mount early.
---
Dude, how can you not see he is being funny since your name contains the word pig?
---
\- Dad I really need to do my homework!
---
\- Yes son but first you must gather blindweed in Swamp of Sorrows for me. 
---
\- mom!!??
---
\- Do as your father tell you!
---
Lol I wish, I started a new job and get 2 weeks, but only after 1 year of accumulating it. No vacation for this guy for a while. After 5 years I can get 3 weeks...
---
I feel like people who keep referencing STRESS TEST 2 don’t actually know that 90% of the players had to restart because they forced everyone onto 3 or 15, so if you started there you were instantly ahead of the Zerg.
---
I am going to be playing as horde this time around. I also will be planning on tanking rather than dpsing.
---
Check post history and cringe
---
not bis for hunters, you want the ring from drakkisath if you have enough hit (gives ap and crit), if you dont you get 2 tarnished elwen rings from dmn (it gives 15 agi and hit) 
---
But its really good for rogues, warriors and feral druids
---
Purify doesn't make stoneform any worse. 
---
Dispelling poisons in yourself costs alot of mana and global cooldowns to the point where you won't even bother versus a rogue.
---
A hunter will just spam viper sting and you will be constantly cleansing it. With stoneform you instantly lose ALL poisons and get immune for some time. Its crazy good.
---
Besides that, it's a free trinket vs a rogues blind which is an autowin.
---
Bleh. I hate shadowpriests.
---
They are so ridiculously powerful for how completely braindead they are to play.
---
Not OP but in my opinion, getting to 60 first just so I can clear MC ASAP. Once I'm clearing MC, I'll go to leveling an alt that I can take more time. Outside of maybe getting your epic mount prior to phase 2, I'll do some dungeons as well but I'm ok no rush once I'm adequate to clear MC.
---
The gap of content between phase 1 and 2 really doesn't have a dire need to grind stuff immediately. MC is going to be cleared the end of the first week.  I only see epic mount as a need prior to honor system in phase 2.
---
By choosing the look and feel I want. Which in my case means a giant pile of feathers, mostly oom. I will dance my way to 60.
---
Seriously, play what appeals to you. The only reason to min/max is if that's how you enjoy the game - if your version of fun is that type of optimizing, then go for it. But if your version of fun is a Warlock in the "wrong" race/faction, do it anyway. You'll find folks to play with  no matter what.
---
For this reason I'm going Alch and Herb and just sucking up the fact that I loose all the utility because I just like being a druid that picks flowers man.
---
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one ©
---
Night Elf is Japanese I'm pretty sure. A lot different than Chinese.
---
True, but beyond the gearing, the actual raid was the same.
---
You are looking at the subreddit 2 months before launch, that's the playerbase who will be prone to minmaxxing, or at least knowing what those options are even if they don't go hardcore to get every drop of them.
---
Be lots of casuals and funtime players come release I would think! 
---
Just make sure you lot don't flame people for not knowing something or understanding alternatives. Help them and explain things.
---
I was an altoholic back then and spend all my gaming time leveling and doing bg. I leveled 6 toons during vanilla. Kevelung was my game time. This time i'm going to focus on one character only
---
People actually believe blizzards changed things, and have cited pservers.
---
Of course he fucking did.
---
Nice guide.
---
 But do you realise you come off as a giant douchebag when you try to belittle and dismiss anyone else's speculations about player behaviour. You're speculating as well. 
---
You can't speak with such finality when your opinion about player behaviour is untested. 
---
Tbh you seem very full of yourself. The entire intro of your guide is spent solely trying to belittle another "guide". That's petty AF. Instantly gives a bad impression of the author.
---
The fact that you snapped at u/InSearchOfThe9's valid criticism solidifies that bad impression.
---
Gimme ingame names, I want to report it to Blizzard for account sharing.
---
I want that damn hunter bow quest.
---
Do it the old school way, farm the elites at Tyr’s Hand. Or farm satyrs in felwood or azhara.
---
to actually raid and not make alts all the time lol
---
you are correct about https://classicdb.ch/ formerly being known as aowow
---
I'm curious who the universally accepted idea guys are. Far as I know blizzard have said absolutely Zippo on the matter.
---
I would imagine from their general attitude of damn I guess we have to give them classic even though it'll suck attitude, means they just won't do anything.
---
No scams but just the usual stuff, regularly checking AH with a bank alt and buy out items that are sold for way to little and resell them. A single BoE item can yield so much gold sometimes. I suspect on Blizzard Classic you are going to make a ton of gold flipping item.  Works well enough on private servers and the playerbase there usually know a lot about the game. For sure new classic players will put up items that are very valuable for way to little gold.
---
WF helps your tank out too, so it balances out
---
Anyone able to list the top gold farming methods for a solo paladin? Any good ones?
---
It's not WC3 but WC3's expansion.
---
What would you call it? TFT is literally an abbreviation of The Frozen Throne.
---
Stress tests
---
I would do it only for the R14 Weapons as a fury. :)
---
Ya that’s weird, we’re all playing right now.
---
I think staying up for 24 isn't that unreasonable.  Just did that for The Division 2 release. That was also a 4am start time for me, just went to bed at 10pm, woke up just before 4. Basically pulled 24 hours, went to bed, up by noon the next day.  
---
But I'd feel OP could do better pacing with 15 hours, 6 hours of sleep, 15 hours of play and 6 hours of sleep instead of trying to push 30 straight hours.
---
You're going to get ahead of the curve by a long shot at 15 hours into the game.
---
Based
---
Either craft or ask someone to craft you these [Truefaith Gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7091) awesome low level healer gloves, friend of mine is still using them at level 41 on an undocumented server.
---
Nihilum got world first kt btw
---
Based on how it went in vanilla and pservers for example.
---
Cross realm bgs were over server groups in vanilla, and my faction in my server group (alliance on Neptulon EU) had faster queue times but I don't know how common that was.
---
I mean, why would a min maxer be terrible at the game ? Infact I'd say that they would probably be better , even more if they played a lot on pservers
---
I did, this is clearly a novelty troll account, and a good one imo.
---
Wrath had some of the best and some of the worst content and, although TBC started the trend, it's Wrath that really accelerated a lot of the QoL changes that basically ruined WoW
---
Get Raggys hammer on my paladin.
---
&gt; I wish that pally had a taunt. Just a taunt. 
---
Not having taunt is not even the biggest problem with prot paladin.
---
They have low single target TPS, bad sustain, inferior itemization (leads to miniscule TPS scaling and overall way less mitigation, avoidance and health), no way of reaching the avoidance cap, higher baseline incoming damage (no 10% damage reduction from defensive stance) and no defensive cooldowns. They are also weak to silence and mana burn, don't have a mobility spell like Intercept or Feral Charge and waste an additional debuff slot with JotC.
---
Even if prot paladins had taunt, they would still be garbage tier in PvE.
---
100% agrew. Fuck mop and fuck BC
---
Even with this it wasn't a free kill, it took 1 month progression to kick the 4HM (6 Raiddays/Week).

Since there were no guides and so on. ;)

---
I wandered into the burning steppes at like level 16 coming from redridge and was melted by a bunch of ?? Imps while they cackled at me
---
Those are extremely rare and far between, the polish playerbase isn't big enough to make a dent in a server. However the french and german guilds will not be rare or far between, they will be all over and obstruct the natural flow of the server. I wouldn't be surprised if this leads to rivalries between nationalities since Vanilla has such a heavy emphasis on teamwork and communication.
---
Get classleards, avoid all drama and toss it to the classleaders. :)

Tauren warrior here. Not the best racial maybe, but I thought they looked bad ass in plate armor!

Not really, tanks will swap to dual weild fury specs for threat over mitigation.

Why wait when we can see naxx logs right now? Kronos-logs.com/raid_info/raid/Naxxramas
---
I like efficiency. There is something that tickles my brain when I figure out a better way to maximize time or effort for value. 
---
Anyway, you think of vanilla wow as being non-min/max because no one knew a lot about the game back then. You'd need a brand new game or to go back to WoWs launch date to experience that again.
---
It's a scam that would only work once per person, because after getting scammed, everyone would check the charges to avoid it happening again.
---
What are you even saying? What isn't enough for raids and what is based on chance?
---
Many whelps handle it
---
Yes.  Midnight release at EB Games.  Also installing TBC via cd roms which took an hour+ and the installation failed twice before working hahaha
---
I’m looking forward to having children cause i really need some free laborers
---
Do the reduce spell resistance bonuses affect pets? Could be one last ploy to increase damage.
---
Well throw in some single cell proteins combined with synthetic aminos, along with that woman in red, and we've got an agreement.
---
The rune costs 18s, not 38.
---
Agree. You'll never see Shadowmeld being useful to a rogue, while being able to counter Blind is completely gamebreaking for rogues. If a rogue blinds you and you can't remove it, that basically means he will be able to stick your ass for the rest of the fight.
---
It's all good either way.  Would still be pretty badass to get rank 14
---
I'm still not sure what should i pick Tauren/Orc d=/. I have a strong feeling that in pvp orc is just much better.

A "code repository" is literally an archive of source code.

Why wait when we can see logs for naxx already? K r onos-logs.com/raid_info/raid/naxxramas
---
Glad you have learned something!
---
Female or male? And hairy legs or not?
---
Its also possible to replenish your stock of shards in the raid. You are not losing out much on dps, using drain soul for the last few percentages off the mobs health.
---
Before the end of week one, min maxers will be screaming and crying like toddlers (from their moms basement) for regularly scheduled new progressive realm launches.  Their elitist hyper focus addiction must be kept fed.
---
I think it was added as something nice for reasonably skilled casual players, and was never really inteded for raiders.
---
What movie / series are these pictures from?
---
So with assuming cross realm bg's, which seems most likely at this point, therefore
---
Horde and alliance will essentially be equal in pop sizes
---
That being said. 
---
Historically Alliance have the shorter queues and Horde have longer queues. 
---
Horde tend to have a larger emphasis as a population over the alliance on pvp.
---
Something about faction fantasy and type of player that gravitates toward Horde creates more casual pvpers. 
---
This is a general statement. Im not talking about your niche experience being in a pvp guild. I am talking casual bg's solo queuing etc..
---
However, your battle group may have a massive alliance stack and horde queues are much faster. But the battle groups should even out and i picture Blizzard will chose battlegroups that balance factions. 
---
So we can make some presumptions. 
---
With everything equal both factions being same size. Horde will have longer queues.
---
Eh I wouldn’t go that far, I already knew the kind of players that are on this subreddit.
---
I'm for one am ready to stare blankly at my screen waiting dor that SoC slot machine jackpot.
---
cause I feel like with the pressure for a RP PvP one, which adds possibilities instead of taking anything away, the RP one will be a ghost town
---
I don’t think complete preBiS is reslly necessary for healers or dps. I understand that tanks need to mitigate damage but with the right skills close enough definitely counts to be competitive in raids.
---
Yes. Engineering is hands down the best profession in the game. Both PvE and PvP.
---
yeah that's what we'll all be facing sadly :/ but they're aiming for a HUGE population at start to have a decent one later on
---
Ton of bad information, fucking paladin are pve kings literally the best fucking class in the entire game in pve. They are great in PvP too.
---
Warriors are king dick dps
---
Mages and warlock basically share the same gear sure tier sets will be easier as a lock but lets be honest tier sets are not the rare drops you will be looking for.  
---
Sure warlock are stronger on horde for PvP but a 20/31 lock is going to do just fine in PvP on either side.
---
Druids are only out classed at high end raiding when people dont fuck up and die and have great gear.  The provide a Ton of utility in mid to low end raiding, also with a lack of paladin on horde they are a go to tank healer.....  
---
Them on top of all this if your not in a top tier guild basically anything can be played and you can complete with other Guildford as long as you put a little more effort in then them.
---
Maybe if you had better healing gear you wouldn’t have had everyone die around you.
---
You just said it was about the danger of leveling.  Now you’re saying it’s to kill other people, which was my point to begin with.
---
My 2nd fav machima
---
If you're playing day 1 it's going to be the optimal route considering there won't be enough mobs to grind. Quests will be your biggest XP.
---
Especially since you say you are going to be in a party most of the time the imp is the best pet. Everyone has more health which means less downtime, you deal more DPS which means things die faster.
---
There's no downside to it other than maybe your feelings on what you anecdotally believe which goes against pretty much everything min/max.
---
The void will take longer. Hell, every other demon will take a lot longer. If you are going to min/max in a party for speed the imp would be the only demon I'd get and skip the rest until later.
---
Yea I've watched quite a few naxx streams and the ignite mage is almost always #1 followed by like 6 to 8 warriors, the rest of the mages compete with the rogues, then everyone else.
---
Oh guys and also, is PVE taken serious on a RP server? Like organising pugs, guilds that focus on raiding etc?
---
This isn’t classic. That’s pserver don’t care what you say it won’t be the same in retail. Just compare my logs with yours throughout real offical classic :)
---
If you don't enjoy both aspects, a PVP server is probably not for you.
---
Elementalist mage? A fucking what?
---
Nah I just hate PVE with a passion and will be swapping between PVP disc, PVP shadow and some lame PVE spec for when I have to inevitably stand in a dungeon pressing '3' for 40 minutes.
---
Underrated comment
---
Ret Paladins were not “sick” at anything in TBC. If you’re taking PvP they never came close to as good as Arms warrior, Rogue, Warlock, or Mage. They were at best mediocre.
---
What are some great pvp builds if you want to duo with a warrior and how good are they for pve?
---
if someone goes for this, they might as well make 4 or more if they can get the mats.  it burns durability very, very fast.
---
Just don't care about it :)
---
I started playing during TBC and quit soon after Cata. I always played warlock and warrior. Both would be nice for Vanilla, but I decided for hunter - mix of both those classes imo.
---
Do I care that hunter is weak in dmg in pve and weak in pvp? Not at all. Because in pve he is really important for kiting and other stuff while in pvp it is class with the highest skill cap. So I'm excited for it. End every single spec has something like this. 
---
It really depends what you're expecting. If I was trying to have the highest mmr in arenas during wotlk, I would go death knight with holy paladin. But I enjoyed playing destro warlock, even though it was 10x harder to win 2v2 arenas.
---
So do you need to be top in dmg meters in raid encounters and battle grounds or do you just want to play the class you like?
---
PS: my friend tried to play boomkin pvp during wotlk. Probably the weakest spec back there. But he loved it anyway
---
I love this.
---
Doesn't it make the cap 6?
---
Doctor weevil is in the beta
---
Troll is the best MT race anyway because of Berserking.
---
Hahahaha of course. You pull the only thing out of your arse that can save you from being wrong. You’re still wrong buddy, other people here are telling you that too. Believe what you want, you’re wrong.
---
Its nice of you to seek out others to learn from.
---
That's a bit cliche. ;) It's all about hiding your true identity with Savory Deviate Delights :)
---
no one said you were
---
Lol that's a really cowardly response to being called out with actual evidence that you're wrong
---
I started in tbc as a casual and leveled on a pve server before switching to a pvp server and I was nervous about starting on a pvp server in classic but this makes me feel much better
---
&gt;Got the route down just really hoping for some good servers on launch

Clear leadership, if your guild doesn't trust you then it'll fail before it even starts. Decide early how the guild leadership works, how loot distribution works, how priorities work etc. 
---
A 40 man team should not consists of 40 individuals, but rather 50-55 ideally. Not only for having reserves when someone can't show up, but also to give members incentive to perform well in order to keep their spot and not get replaced.  If they have no incentive to better themselves, many will ultimately fall out due to the raidlogging trap after a certain point in progression. Most people probably think this would only apply to HC guilds but it often leads to the demise of casual guilds when people just lose the motivation to play. 
---
As a guild master you don't really have to know the ins and outs of all the classes or know the boss fights by heart, you're just supposed to organize it with subleaders (raid leads, class leads) being the ones provide all info.
---
There's a lot of data on which faction should expect to have more people - quizzes, years of pservers and years of WoW and 2 years of vanilla. Data on which faction PvPs more etc. I dont necessarily have it all, but it exists.
---
Lotto numbers are (almost always) fully random so you don't have a way to at least partially predict them.
---
 The farthest I managed to level a paladin was to around level 25 or so. Just so incredibly boring that I couldn't take it. 
---
 I guess the question I would have is when does leveling a paladin become more engaging and fun? If I didn't enjoy it at 25 chance I will enjoy it if I get some more levels?
---
 Also for those who have played all healing classes. Healing as a paladin at 60 how does it rank fun wise compared to the other healers? 
---
 Perhaps should add that paladins looks like a blast to play at 60 pvp. Must be great playing as holy spec in organized PvP. If I ever decided to try paladin again I think I would just focus on PvP.
---
I've played Holy Paladin in PvP from MoP through the beginning of BfA, I plan on playing one again in Classic, how different will it be?
---
I asked for an analysis, not a definite answer, and we definitely have data to make some sort of analysis..
---
What? Ignite stacking is insane threat. Even with reduced threat talents the sheer dps that ignite stacking causes is enough that you have to let the ignite drop off to avoid the mage who "owns" the ignite from being killed.
---
Something like [THIS](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzf0uZVVGhobt)
---
I was planning on going ele/resto shaman to dps pvp and get easy group spots for raids and dungeons healing, but my bitch ass friends are insisting on alliance...
---
So, i have it down to warlock or priest, my question is, is it possible to play shadow in pvp and spec enough into healing talents to do reasonable healing in dungeons and non progression raids? Basically how many talent points do shadow priests have to play with?
---
Tyty :)
---
Cross realm bgs in vanilla were over a few servers not all servers, and you didnt always have balance. Also the overall balance for horde:ally isn't 50:50 so even if you have all servers it wont be equal.
---
To be fair though, on average your mage will do less than his warrior. Some raids you'll do more by rolling ignite, but that won't happen everytime
---
thinking about it for the past few months...
---
Treating the game as an escape from life, and not an additional everyday chore.
---
If you surround yourself with children that need a mommy, then, yes, it will be very time consuming.
---
If you find adults able to exhibit a measure of responsibility and awareness of self and others, the very time consuming part is finding them - being in a guild with them will be easy. 
---
Btw. the difference between child and adult in this context isn't age.
---
Ret is considerably worse.
---
the gnomish gadgets don't break or consume, so the ideal path is go goblin, make everything you will need, then switch to goblin.
---
Both have rocket boots, but gnomish boots just malfunction, vs. goblin boots exploding (consuming the boots, usually).
---
Reported for upvoting.
---
If your mages are working together, as they should be, yes it will happen every time. Not saying mages do more damage than warriors. One mage does more damage than the warriors.
---
There has been a final word. It isn't happening. Denying reality won't change it :)))
---
Lmao at min/maxing your personality.
---
On average yea, but when was this ever about averages and exactly about what I said which is one mage getting ignite stacks? Look at the logs I posted
---
Horde are usually slightly bigger than alliance on pvp servers, which means alliance gets shorter que times in those cases. 
---
Twink brackets don't really follow the same distribution and there won't be any definitive answer to that one
---
Anyone know what Galor's viewport addon might be?  
---
I like the way it's cut angles in the corners.
---
Or is it just kgPanels?
---
is there any actual source to this other than a twitter post from a streamer?
---
Peanut!
---
I played as a holy priest and joined hallowed after a few months of wiping on nefarian. Character name is the same as my username.
---
By knowing what I want and being a decisive adult with their own thoughts that can't be swayed by random reddit comments on the internet. That usually helps :)))
---

---
Every class is fun to play in vanilla. If you know what role you want to fill and pick a class that can succeed at that role you will not regret your choice. Best class is for alts, main what you enjoy.
---
I'm sure there will be. They most certainly did exist in vanilla. Although, I dont remember if they just added the aesthetic stuff or if there were quests as well.
---
Pickpocketing BRD as Rogue :&gt;
---
Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, about classic wow itself.
---
Have clear goals and map out a path for how they'll happen. You'll need the charisma to build up a core team that'll trust you and you'll need to be more dedicated than basically anyone else in your guild, at least for long enough for the core team to trust you.
---
It's slow but steady. Honestly it's not that bad, can get a bit sluggish shortly before you get new HF/Smite, but the 1.12 version of Priests a lot easier to level as Holy than 1.0.
---
Grab Wand Spec and the mana regen in Combat, go for the 10% damage increase for HF/Smite and Spiritual Guidance and you probably won't even need Spirit Tap.
---
1.0 i wouldn't have leveled as Holy, but with 1.12 in seriously considering it.
---
It is less than 2 fcking month's till release.
---
Do you seriously think that they will completely Change their mind from layering after we have cried about it for 3-4 month's now?
---
I don't see them Change shit. It is how it is People have to get comfortable with it.
---
A reasonable Approach would be to ask them to Change layering so that it isn't abusable. 
---
Sooo annoyed by this Topic... If they would just take it away - have fun. They won't rent more Servers simply due to Money reasons.
---
Meaning we would have the same amount of Servers but a lot of layers less. Sooooo there would probably be 100k playing while 500k are in the Queue? Great :)
---
If it won't be the same why are you so confident that warriors will be at the top? Oh, you're talking out of your ass, i see
---
Auto attack and seal is all you got to level with, doesn't get much more interesting. Aoe grinding is too inefficient without proper gear and talents, which you wont have while leveling. 
---
Healing is spamming flash of light, not really exciting in any way, shape or form.
---
PvP is where you'll have most fun and be challenged. Finding use for all those support spells you've got.
---
As with most relations, it's all about managing expectations. 
---
Figure out what you and those you want to play with want in regards to:
---
Attendance: 100%? Rotation? Core group based on what criteria?
---
Preparation: consumables? Personal responsibility vs. Guild tax vs ffa. 
---
Performance: what's the minimum performance you can accept as a group? 
---
Loot system and priority?
---
and what consequences does breaking any of the above have for a player.
---
Once you've set expectations, all you and any officers need to worry about is recruitment, handling the management of any agreed upon systems, and tactics/ killing bosses.
---
unrelated but you wouln't happen to have a human rep google doc would you?
---
I plan to go from teldrassil asap and go to human zones for rep so this news is depressing :(
---
Im not a programmer so I dont know if this would work,
---
Are there no videos pre-1.12 with the combat log open showing how hard they hit and how much damage they take? Couldnt you then figure out the values based on that data? Just spitballing here
---
Arent this out of the 1.12 AV version though?
---
Some of us like pushing our skills of playing to the best of our abilities. Other like you probably want to take their time and don't feel the same way. Its like we are sprinters running a mile as fast as we can and people like you decided it would be nice to just walk the mile. 
---
We both travel the mile eventually. I'm just moving at my own faster pace. The nolife pace.
---
Booking leave for whatever reason makes you happy sounds like a valid reason to me
---
Beta currently has the summer fest going.
---
There is always a lack of tanks/healers, no matter the server
---
Yeah fair, I re-read the guy's post, he's off. An ignite rolling mage will always do more dmg than any warrior, it just won't be the same mage day-to-day
---
Sleep 8 hours every other day instead.
---
They dont disappear and can be refilled as you clear the instance/raid also. Pretty easy to keep them supplied.
---
Besides everything else that was said, be a great communicator. It's very important.
---
Yes,  no body parts in this version if I read correctly
---
It puts the blindweed in the herb bag, or else it gets the belt again!
---
I heard they fixed several bugs already from this video including that one. Not concerned here.
---
Nostalgia
---
Undead vs troll shadow priest PvP. 
---
I CAN'T DECIDE!
---
Thanks for the reply. Sounds like the preconceived notions I had then were pretty accurate.
---
Shit, you're right
---
No, not natively the Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor (I think?) which is different from the X86/AMD64 platform that WoW is designed for (Running on Windows, MacOS and Linux with an application layer to translate the Windows system calls to Linux system calls).
---
There would need to be an X86/AMD64 Emulator + Something to change the Syscalls, both of these would be a burden on the little computer. On top of these problems the General Pupose CPU would have trouble handling the complex OpenGL graphics of the current WoW engine.
---
If you are looking to get away with playing WoW on something small/cheap, there are a few ways to do it the Raspberry Pi is not one of them.
---
alcaz island :D
---
Imp with fire shield while leveling is a god send, esp in a group with a Druid Or pally
---
Druids are good tanks in 1.12 - there's some bosses they do better than warriors, a few that warriors do better and for most bosses druids and warriors are more or less equally good. You might want 2 or 3 MCPs per raid but you don't need to farm them anywhere near as much as feral dps.
---
That's the name, yes! What the hell was up with that place anyway? :)
---
Soooo
---
- no layering because #nochanges
---
- remove leeway because #somechanges
---
Makes sense to me.
---
You can, but it's much more enjoyable as Holy. Holy gives you spellpower through SPI, which means you can downrank more. You cast a bit faster, squeezing in the odd OO5S regeneration tick. Go 13 Disc for mana regeneration inside the 5s rule.
---
Sure, your can heal everything as Shadow, I've done so myself. But it's actually a lot better with Holy because Holy enables you to manage your mana that much more efficiently. OTOH, Smite is incredibly inefficient for DPS, so that won't work well
---
Not a guild leader but the advice my guild leader gave
---
1.Be ready to organise raids
---
2. Be ready to teach new players the mechanics of the raid
---
3.You organise schedules for when its a raid night or not so ask around and make a perfect timing for a raid
---
those original specs are totally wrong, the new classic client runs on Legion build and has newer requirements. Not a lot, but still newer.  
---
There's a thread somewhere on Reddit about testing the Beta buiild on various hardware and testing spec reqs
---
I was only ever on the recieving end of this, but I can imagine it was very profitable given the insane prices that the milk had.
---
How was anything he said funny rather than condescending?
---
Might want to fit in some gaps daily for food, water, and light exercise if you want to live past day 2 or 3
---
Dude, get some help.
---
What about during dongeon and raid ?
---
Yes, it was absolutely a thing in classic.
---
Well, if you're not willing to wear the AQ robes, chances are you won't get into AQ anyway. I guess you could wear Robe of Volatile Power until T3 (still a dress, but more fashionable IMO), but good luck telling your class leader that despite the loot council's decisions, you won't be wearing Robes of the Guardian Saint because of aesthetics.
---
The shoulder situation is much better though, Wild Growth Spaulders are amazing both functionally and aesthetically.
---
I can't see them not having Language Servers in EU. Its not like its any work. They just have to mark 1 Server as German and one Server as French - and maybe on Spanish Realm.
---
RP-PVP is difficult because its definitely niche and the Server could die pretty quickly.
---
Disenchant mats, vendor gold, selling pre-raid 60 gear to other players. Pretty hard to find better solo gold farming. Alternatively you can farm water elementals and get maybe 2% drop rate essence of water to sell for 5g ea. Maybe 25g/h? Mara can net 50-75g/h consistently.
---
This, and when youre trying to find a rep guide for human zones (Im rolling NE, want horsey) its even harder :/
---
There's also green mobs outside of BWL, MC, AQ and Naxx to farm so you can just show up to a raid 5 minute before and get some shards. Keep the mages making 30 stacks of water some company.
---
Can I play the game as I want pleeeeease ?
---
I can feel you if you didn’t like the heavy Chinese influence across everything. On the other hand, I was a fan that there was a consistency across the continent while also feeling different per zone. I don’t love when a small continent feels like a bunch of different areas that just get connected, original two continent excluded because of their size.
---
Why would I click a link with no information about what's in the link. Plus the title is not at all relevant to classic wow.
---
Very. I remember when the Cata Prepatch hit at the end of wrath it changed a lot it terms. Still fun imo. Find a warrior friend, the more he stay’s alive the more shit dies.
---
Look for the note in one of the rooms in the bottom of the boats. :)  It despawns after one person selects it.
---
What epics are you talking about? The headless horseman stuff wasn't in vanilla.
---
I cant remember anything more than wands and candy
---
I agree that I would like to see the subs separated. But only so that the Classic figures wont just get rolled into the Retail figures come annual financial report time.
---
But what if you could kill the bluescreen before it locks up your computer 
---
How cool would that be

Of all the world events listed here [https://www.wowhead.com/events](https://www.wowhead.com/events) I believe only the following have been in Vanilla; Harvest festival, children's week, lunar festival, feast of winter veil and darkmoon fair. I could be wrong, it has been a while. But none of these had any chance on great epic gear besides dmf.
---
Negative
---
If you're talking about the ones that got removed I think the game will launch already without them, read yesterday somewhere on the official forums. Think the beta players can confirm it.
---
As a Dwarf Paladin being my main for over all the time I know WoW, started in Vanilla, 4-5 ishs  months before TBC coming out, it took me 27 full days to get to lvl 60 and 8 days to get lvl 70. ( age of 11 started to play WoW Didn't know what the f I was doing. I found a cave in Dun morogh with those Ice Giants very impressive and I remember I was leveling there from lvl 8 to 12 or 13 because I didn't like to do quest. I didn't understand anything back in those days. Addons I heard of first when I went to raiding in TBC, and thotbott/Wowhead etc did not exist for me :D
---
I leveld'd as Holy ( as I was really interested in helping other people stay alive) . As my brother was leveling a mage he was going way faster than me ( never group'd because we thought after killing a mob and gaining 50% experience that it was going to take longer to lvl . 
---
I remember in lvl 40, he saw some dudes on mounts and asked how to get them, they told him you have to gather 90/100 gold to buy it. He only had a few gold and no more.  I think hes first mount buy in was around lvl 52 .
---
I came in at lvl 40 , and basicly got my mount for free :D
---
I was telling him that Paladins were the best class and even started to like the class more and more. 
---
Didn't raid anything in Vanilla because TBC came around when I was nearly 60 . SO i have no experience to tell about that, Paladins became a lot more attractive in TBC , because suddenly Protection Talents were alot better, and even Retri worked . Allthough I saw most paladins going either Tank or Holy in TBC.
---
My paladin was my only character I lvl'd in my WoW Times, I played untill Pandaria came out. And Beside some twinks, I never had any other max lvl character out there. Doing maximum things , such as professions, rep grinds, was so much fun for me , that I had no time doing another character.
---
My professions were Tailoring and Enchanting.
---
And now, everybody will gonna laugh at me for having no gather professions, having tailoring, enchanting as a Plate guy, But man, Those 2 things are so great together.
---
I have to explain why I took these during my leveling experience, I was running in Ironforge as a dwarf paladin lvl 14 or so,  and I suddenly saw a mage or a warlock with a staff riding around and that staff was glowing. I was like That is so fucking Cool, Asked how he did that, He was very nice and explained a little bit about enchanting. I thought it was very nice and told this guy, I am gonna take this. 
---
That same guy, was going to be a great friend of mine, and stil is today. He wanted to help me out and give me some stuff. He tried to trade alot of (noobie stuf ) but my inventory was full. He asked me how much Space I had left and told him like 1 or 2. I didn't had any other bag equiped As I didn't know how to get those ( no lucky in drops and even not buying it from a vendor, those 6-8 bags :D) 
---
 Anyway, He also explained how people with tailoring could make bags and sell them on the Auction House for alot of money. I was very interesting in doing the same, so he took me to the tailoring trainer, and So the battle started to lvl those 2 profs. Even to the day we live in, I still have those 2 proffs on my dwarf paladin, never thought about replacing those 2. I stil llike them , and likely going to take them again. 
---
In TBC, after becoming better and better, I was grinding alot of patterns for enchanting and tailoring, and I was like a well known enchanter on my server for doing stuff like +15 agilty and +25 agilty's on weapons for twinks, stuff as Mongoose on weapons and all kind of stuff . I even bought Patterns on Ah which costed like 1000gold to get a full enchant list.  , I think I missed only 1 enchant at the end of TBC,  which was like a agilty or stamina on bracer enchant( at that time around 10-20k gold on action house, ) 
---
All by all, Paladins are a great Class. Maybe it will be different in Vanilla ( Yes it will be ) ( buffman) and holy will mostly like be 90% of the time. Spells as Lay on Hands and Bubble are so great . You do things everybody dream off ( Bubble and stone to inkeeper if you are getting attcked is 1 thing I like so much, and can laugh about it ) 
---
Make some1 full hp with 1 click on a button is  Huge 
---
 you are tanky , healer,  buffs is a thing for alliance which will help PVE alot. 
---
Leveling experience as a duo will be really good, going alone can be hard and will take time.  But is a bit better than solo warrior. 
---
Doing alot of detective work to get the most out of leveling, is duo with a lock or a mage. (warrior can be great to ) Mage is fantastic to not having to care about food, you can aoe tank for him and he will do the dmg. 
---
With a warrior it will be really easy to find people for dungeons, as you just type in looking for 3 dps. 
---
Without having to worry about a (noob healer, and noob tank )
---
With a warlock he won't just go oom ( out of mana) and ooh ( Out of Health) so he can basicly become a killing machine while u tank mobs and heal him. 
---
Free mount at lvl 40 and a epicmount which will cost 350-700 gold , depends on AH, items u need to selfcraft/buy from auction house . Instead of a  mount for 100 gold at lvl 40 ( which will be hard) and a epic mount at 1000 gold at lvl 60. 
---
As a healer in raids, and you can be tanks in dungeons pre 60 , you will be in the race to ''always getting asked out to help and will likely be in raids and stuff. My experience with paladins is that, on servers there is like out of 8 classes, a 3-4% population of Paladins. ( who are lvl 60 and willingly to raid etc) so that means there is always a ask for the paladins out there. ) 
---
I hope alot more people will try to play paladins in Vanilla as I saw in that latest Poll here on the subreddit , Where in Europa are so few paladins. 
---
Good luck, and hope people will have the time to read this post , as It will be long without a TLDR.
---
And Excuses for my English, I don't like to speak and type it. As being from Holland, we get it in school and stuff, but I am not that type of guy who is good in language :D
---
Esfands
---
"The Light, and how to swing it" is pretty good for ret guids
---
No idea but as you can only see them with detect invisibility so warlocks are the only class with access them it really seems like their only reason to exist is to make locks less tedious to play.
---
I guess it also helps class fantasy and the general fantasy of duskwood, though
---
They are the sole reason alliance is significantly better in pve than horde. Paladins. That's it.
---
MC for sure. By the time ZG is out there are more options.
---
probably not :D north UK?
---
Actually hit level 60, lol :D
---
Yes, but Blizz will prolly make something happen, who knows 👀
---
Playing a class that doesn't get forced into a different role than advertised in Pve.
---
Thanks for the testing! I suspected the numbers were off but haven't been able to find an accurate database yet. I've updated my more recent version of the file with /u/oNodrak 's values (below). You can find the revised file here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LFyi1TfJfCYn_rk4jsCVhomubZswyvgAGLCEVw13XEM/edit?usp=sharing
---
I just hope Blizzard responds so I don't have to see this same type of post every other day on this sub. It's getting obnoxious.
---
You're not wrong about the inflation thing, but if they tried to charge an amount adjusted for inflation they would lose a lot more than they would gain. In 2004  f2p (p2w) models weren't a thing. Now they are.
---
&gt;, Im someone who underhandedly crafts my group in order to not compete with people, which is equally unfair, but less transparent.
---
It's totally transparent and we all know you're doing it.
---
I think most of the events are there already. But all of them are pretty tame compared to later expansions and have no loot to grab. They are just there for the flavour.
---
To avoid the race war
---
Troll priest is objectively better in PvP tbh
---
I still wish people would call it matchmaking. Because it is.
---
A proper LFG/R system can be awesome.
---
Let the dude do the stuff he wanna do.
---
Ah I quit after clearing AQ40 so never experienced this, good tip though!
---
Tanks have literally never been a dime a dozen wtf are you talking about? Tanks were the single least represented role.
---
Replying again as you obviously do not get it, and I've been downvoted for whatever reason. The chinese farmer whom I was friends with was inviting me to come to the Olympics in the future..
---
I want to finish all the content I was never able to do when I was 16. Also thunderfury isn't a bad thing to aim for either.
---
9 hours 10-15!
---
loktar omar
---
I can definitely agree with that!
---
4g20s everytime
---
Tho, it was meant as a joke. At first at least.
---
Depends on how you view the world
---
Take it slow.
---
There's people who enjoy leveling, and that's fine !  
---
IMO, I prefer the end game content, so I wanna rush the leveling process and go straight to end game.
---
People wants to play the game the way they like !
---
Aren't there other ways to detect invisibility? Like through potions or the human racial ability?
---
I wasn't considering it at all for PvE. That's just insane. I've been running numbers and overall it's pretty bad, even for PvP. It's a meme-build at best. At this point I probably won't main a hunter though; I forgot how horrible it was with their on-the-go abilities. I kept thinking Arcane didn't share a cooldown with Aimed, too. That must have been TBC when that changed I guess. It's neat seeing serpent sting reach almost 1800 damage though, but Arcane sticking at ~650 at best is pretty bad If anything that probably should have been the base damage. If it had at least an 80% coefficient, it'd be worth the setup for PvP activities.
---
Nostalgia hits hard for those Elwyn forest, darkwood, moments but this time will go horde so:
---
UD Lock or UD spriest. Max alchemy and herb, gather all world drops recipes, makes lots of gold by making flasks, etc, experience the horde side of Only attunement, participate on AQ opening, gather all T0 set and if on priest, get Anathema.
---
Just playing it cool, enjoy the quests and the leveling without rushing.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time.
---
My bro told me he havin a kid and my first thought is how young can you start em farming ele fires?
---
[try this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points)
---
Level 10 will be 100% doable in under 3 hours on launch day.
---
There are earth elementals in the north-western badlands too, just up in the mountain on the right as you ride east out of the horde outpost.
---
Ashkandi is a retri/hunter pvp weapon, warriors have better alternatives such as bonereaver’s edge &amp; rank 14, however some warriors might want a shot aswell if they didnt rank and got unlucky with BRE drops.
---
They have a working 1.12 server and client running internally to compare against.
---
Wow you really are a troll indeed. But you don't have to tell your self that.
---
Pro tip: join classic at phase 2 or on a low pop server and you won't experience the one thing that makes us even able to play the game at launch :)
---
*Asks question to OP*
---
- Third party: What's it to you?
---
* Answers*
---
- Nobody wants you to tell them how to play.
---
Yup, really funny. I see it now.
---
PUT THE FUCKING BLINDWEED IN THE HERB BAG
---
Very helpful, thanks!
---
But what would be the point in going to a level 20-30 zone and doing that? Also AFAIK invisibility is a different mechanic to stealth
---
Mostly dedication. I don't mean you have to do hc stuff but actually keep your guild running. It does require quite a lot work and if you want to lead guild it means that even if you have month you don't want to you still have to. Worst thing you can do to people is speak how you want to lead casual raid guild and then after two months you are just playing something else. This is pretty much like couching kids football team. You can't just quit because you want to do something else.
---
And get help. People you trust, irl friends if you just can. Things are way easier when you have trusty officers. Be humble and even if you are one who is having crown treat all other officers as equals. Don't be dickhead blinded by glorious title.
---
I have been guild leader since Mists of Pandaria. There has been ups and downs. But I have learned a lot and way I lead guild is really different now than what it was back in 2012.
---
People know very well what the game contains and how long the content will last.
---
You will not get in combat until the spell lands. So you could meld an incoming cast. For example mage polies you and starts casting pyro. Combat drops after 5-6 sec, trinket + meld.
---
I dont really understand how there can be a lack of tanks when warriors are one of the most played classes in vanilla, are most warriors just bad/inexperienced and dont feel comfortable tanking? I cant wait to tank it all on my warrior.
---
Try to stick to one or two characters instead of making an army of alts.  
---
I might fail.
---
It won't be like that on release if you are not extremely lucky. Either first one to log in or first one on new layer.
---
Do note that I'm speaking of my 2005-2006 experience, when MCP wasn't a thing and bears weren't given the chance to tank in my guild. I am well aware that feral druid do a better job in today's meta but I still think it's not worth the effort compared to warrior so I've decided to not roll druid again.
---
Most likely u either raid in a guild which does  nax and wont allow thoose specs or you play thoose specs and raid in a guild stuck in bwl
---
Unless you play a warrior. 😭😭
---
If it makes you feel any better, I remember Arcane Shot not sharing a cooldown timer with Aimed Shot before TBC came out... but perhaps it indeed was when TBC opened up. /shrug
---
Warriors can also get dark edge of insanity from c’thun, forgot to mention that, it also usually goes to warriors first.
---
Amazing stuff. I see you just released the rogue one, but didn't see a post appear.  For those who can't wait: https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQGqSLFq\_m/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link
---
100 yards is definitely what it feels like. I'd have to agree there.
---
If you wanna play a certain class and spec just do it, there will be a space for you in a raid, you may have to work harder to get the spot and while in raid but you should find somewhere to go
---
Don't be afraid, to play what you want. Find a guild, which doesn't stigmatize you for not playing what is optimal. You'll be happier for it in the long run anyway.
---
Don't listen to people, who say xy spec is crap. It's all bullshit. 
---
Sure, a ret, moonkin, feral druid, shaman or shadow priest do less damage than a fury warrior, rogue, mage, warlock or hunter. Will the dps loss weaken the raid significantly? No.
---
Is a dwarf priest better than a human or night elf priest? Is a human a better choice for melee dps than another race. Yes, but how much does that matter to you?
---
The game is more than dps charts, healing charts or whatever. You should play what you enjoy most and if what you enjoy most is to be in a top guild and beat everything as quickly as possible, then yes, you should choose what's optimal. But if you want to raid as a moonkin. Then go ahead and do it, you will find open minded people, who accept you.
---
Totally fine.  It's the same as a warrior tank rolling on a 2 hander.
---
I leveled a dwarf priest as holy way back when. I remember I spent a lot of time in dungeons, mostly because I enjoyed that kind of play. So it felt like I leveled fast because I enjoyed it....that is the real key, enjoyment. If you are trying to get to 60 as fast as possible and raid, maybe do something else, but I don't enjoy rushing through, that is why I am interested in Classic in the first place.
---
Everyone can just do it at their own pace as a priest anyway, you are going to get in raids by healing the right person in a five man. Don't even have to try super hard if you aren't trying to be DPS. As long as you are half decent it is hard to go 20 minutes without an invite to at least a five man.
---
Gearing up a tank is easy. You get groups fast, you have no loot competition, and guilds often help out with boe's. So half a year into vanilla tanks lfg are rare, how long you gonna look? Is it worth an hour of your time finding a tank still gearing? Is it worth giving up a righteous orb or the .02%recipe drop to save that hour and have a geared tank that knows the run? If tank is your main, selling tanking service or reserving a rare drop is your best bet for gold income.
---
I honestly feel like this was a massive part of the beginning of the end of retail wow that gets glossed over.
---
They split every single guild in two. So dumb.
---
Gott get a shaman who can twist windfury and tranquil air.
---
You do know what ignite is?
---
FFUUCK!!!
---
It got better in TBC but the stigma was still there on my server/guilds. Bears were forever off-tanks and only in LK with the crazy initial threat of Berserk did I get the chance to main-tank most bosses. The ulduar balance patch also put cat DPS in a very strong position and that's when I started feeling rewarded for the efforts put in learning the class. Before WotLK I would have traded my druid for a warrior in a heartbeat.
---
&gt;the gnomish gadgets don't break or consume, so the ideal path is go goblin
---
You mean gnomish for this part right?
---
Yes you can do this if you want to spend 150g on changing specialization
---
Yes and yes.
---
I'm going to duo with a friend. He as warrior, me as paladin. We're doomed :P
---
As a huge fan of Shamans I wonder if I would like Paladins?
---
What country do you work in where that's even legal??
---
Hah thanks!
---
Bloody hell, that's the mandela effect again right there. WotLK was when they had 10-or-25 options for the same raid?
---
You can always just run the dungeons again when your friends are online. Chances are you don't get the drops you want the first time through.
---
Troll if you want to tryhard, Undead if you want to look really cool and beat other priests and locks badly. 
---
I'll roll UD myself, but if someone put a gun to my head and told me I had to pick a race for a shadow priest that has an overall better matchup spread in 1v1s and does better in BGs, I'd prolly go for Troll.
---
I will be crafting Nightfall for my paly alt and play it mostly for PvP !
---
Get Rokh'Delar for my main hunter !
---
A large number of subscribers aren't hard to maintain, it's rapid growth that kills servers. 
---
WotLK was stagnant and they had the hardware to maintain the population and no need to build more servers. Vanilla was roughly doubling in size per annum and doubling your server capacity every year is a real bitch. That's really why we saw so many issues back then and nothing like it since then.
---
Because it's pretty good gold per hour and you don't have to worry about getting ganked.
---
I'm really curious how effective this will be if the /camp method is not working anymore though. Usually after princess you jump down, kill the gater, then camp and when you log in you are at the front of the instance ready to start a new run.
---
For sure! I just want people to all enjoy Classic as much as possible cause it's so damn good.
---
Don't cut yourself short!
---
After phase 2 you do jump runs.
---
Besides the obvious Troll racials for PVE, Trolls also have the coolest bow animation.
---
remove server cap! 
---
if a private server can host 16k people on a single realm, a billionaire company can host 20k
---
Make strat live groups and reserve something. Dps easy to fill.
---
No, you should definitely have access, have you tried contacting Blizzard?
---
The matrix
---
How did people handle the reserves. Just expect people to pass it or do they ML until they get it (I guess that's more practical on a boss drop).
---
If you screenshot the agreement to it then them breaking it I guess that's griefing so you ca trust people somewhat
---
You never know! In all honesty I also played on the newest fresh pserver, silverhand. I had a really rough start as I wasn't able to connect until 6 minutes after the server went live. However I had an amazing day 1.  I'm really positive i'll have a strong 1-60 again on Classic with the route i've been working on for months. Hype!

Very strange indeed.  Have you tried reformatting your hard dive and reinstalling your operating system?  That typically fixes it for most people.

---
Still curious how this works regarding lock out. Does it count as entering a new instance? Can you do this a maximum of 5 times/hour or does it bypass the lock out?
---
Can you share the link of this video?
---
I saw 2 farming my epic mount + raid consumes on private servers over a pretty sizable period of time.
---
Any gear +int is healer gear. If you have a full set of green/blue int gear (healing power/mp5 if you find it) in your bags you can heal all up to BRD without changing talents.
---
No. It makes your cap 6% instead of 9%. Which means you only need 3% hit from gear as you get 3% from talents. 5 bow skill = 3% hit chance against level 63 targets (raid bosses).
---
I'm tanking but going for healing gear, is that ok? 
---
Problem solved.
---
they patched it out in 2.1.0.  
---
meaning it was working prior to this patch.
---
you can't tell from when to when with this information...
---
Idk, people will be at work and at school during the day. Daytime hours might not be so bad. 
---
Anytime between 5pm and 3am EST will be the worst, as thats when the most people will be on.
---
Green humans.
---
does the number really matter all that much? its not like 120 is some aburdly high number thats hard to keep track of
---
Literally every class has its use in PvE, there are no "bad" classes. Just pick whichever one has the endgame PvE role that you want:
---
Warrior - Tank, DPS
---
Rogue/Mage/Warlock/Hunter - DPS
---
Priest/Paladin/Shaman - Heal
---
Druid - Heal, kinda decent offtank/dps with good gear
---
I don't think you understand. I'm not attacking the merits of EQ. I'm pointing out that they are completely different beasts. It's like comparing Sweden with the US. They will never have the same problems and therefore will never have the same solutions. What might work for one won't work for another. 
---
WoW is multitudes larger than EQ. It is way more popular. Way better known. And has significant more channels for marketing. The amount of people who will try WoW I'm the first month and subsequently quit is staggering. Layering is designed to alleviate this. Helping with the surge of players at launch is just a side benefit of layering.
---
Stretch on the flight paths, load up on carbs before launch, pre make a bunch of sandwiches, buy a big case of water &amp; lots of pre prepared foods. Lets get it
---
It’s just the stress test. They are making this all confusing. 
---
Skip yourself the trouble and just hop on a P- Server to get your itch. You won’t care about beta anymore.
---
I always felt unsure about that and I'm rolling healer instead of tank in classic. 
---
Healer having to pay for a tanks really meh, they don't suffer the queues DPS do and end of the day that's all it comes down to.
---
And die 5 seconds later due to the boss parry hasting them to death. GG
---
Looking forward to playing a paladin at launch. A lot of people say it's a boring class but I don't mind it too much. I love the class fantasy, the buffs, auras, blessings! And with it being on the simpler side I don't have to focus on throughput as much which is nice. I'll go dwarf female but haven't decided on a name yet. Any suggestions?
---
Maybe he is refering to the brewfest-trinkets that dropped from the event-boss in brd. I remember one with a lot of stamina for tanks.
---
"warriors have better alternatives such as Rank 14"
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
lower the cost to 25 gold or something
---
Ahh ok.  Sometimes its nice to look and wish I had free time.  But then I also, didn't own a house, didn't have a career, didn't have a wife.  So you got to remind yourself that real life is better haha.
---
This can be a decent PVP build, because paladin t1/t2/t2.5 is all about hybrid stats anyways.  
---
The problem with paladin DPS is that it's so inefficient except in very specific instances.  No debuffs to help you like shadow/fire/frost damage (only -armor helps you).  Consecration is extremely mana inefficient.  Your best spells only target undead which is infrequently a factor. 
---
Paladin 'damage' builds are IMO much better suited to PVP.  
---
I won't be leveling another paladin in classic (done it already on a pserver!) but I would suggest for PVE to just go 21/25/0 (5 points leftover) to do PVE heals, get blessing of sanc + reckoning, and be able to PVP and PVE under only one spec.   You're also more effective in PVE with this build as a healer since you get Kings, better concentration aura, and can apply blessing of Sanc to the tanks. 
---
Holy/Reck is the best paladin PVP spec as well.  Ultimate support class, plus reck bombs!?
---
I disagree, play smart not hard. I made those kids anyway, they’re half me so it’s basically the same thing
---
P-server experience is completely irrelevant in this context.  
---
As for predicting how faction balance is going to settle.. entirely impossible to know the answer to this right now on an individual server basis, let alone battle group basis.  Nobody in the world can give you an answer to this that would be any better or more insightful than your own personal guess.
---
Almost every class is boring in PvE lol. I'm playing mage again, and we literally just spam frostbolt for the first few raids.
---
Nerd.
---
Leveling as resto isnt as bad as you think. Even soloing. Your lack of downtime almost makes up for lack of dps. Then again, leveling as enh and carrying +int green gear for healing works fine also.
---
The original fel Reaver's.
---
That's an interesting point.
---
Wotlk didn't have to take into account that their entire player base would double.
---
NE is bis for daggers tho, so just go dagger.  
---
Now if ur saying ur gonna go gnome rogue then you can go screw urself :P
---
Murica!
---
Skinning/LW alt. Can make end game ench mats pretty quickly.
---
troll warrior is bis for horde tank tho. Go Dual Wield with daggers and ACLG and pop zerking for free attack speed. = really good Threat Per Second.   
---
Tauren + health is useless.
---
This video always made we wanna try a rogue back in the day.
---
&gt;STVietnam, the main reason to play on a PvP server
---
FTFY
---
No chance at all.
---
Taking the boat with a lvl60 of the opposite faction
---
I feel like we already know that this isn't healthy :)
---
I find this build fascinating.. I really hope it’s a thing (from what I’ve seen of drakova’s beta testing.. it might actually work on classic!)
---
On the other hand.. having to farm MCP :(
---
Well, the thing with warlocks, you never go oom, and you have a pet, so easy to solo, even elites...
---
Yes, Pandaria is beautiful and I'd honestly say that out of all the continents, it's the one where the different zones feel like they belong.
---
I just want this to be a possibility without the downside of having to force 1 theme on the playerbase for 2+years
---
As a healer, i presume you would be requested to heal alot of stuff especially if you have a good rep. 
---
My comment was targetted at dps.
---
To clarify you shouldnt have to pay. But im always fine to pay a good over gear efficient tank. 
---
Healers from my experience typically can be as diva as a tank and if i roll a priest first over a mage. I wont be paying. 
---
Also i hope you are also a Greg :).
---
Depends on guild. Also rng could be a bitch. Our guild never seen it drop in vanilla
---
I mean, I’m fine with them as long as they’re in the alliance.
---
5% pet damage and stun resist with blood fury AND axe specialization
---
the choice is easy
---
zug zug
---
Tanking on any server is a means to getting gear. Atleast that’s my plan, if I’m MT then I’m in every raid, higher chance to get dps items as well
---
I dont think so, I'd probably agree. 40-50 you have to clear a bunch of different zones which adds a lot of travel time and on top of that you probably dont have your mount right at 40. At 50, the zones are more condensed with quests and you have your mount for all of it. It may not actually be faster, but it probably feels like it with the reduced time traveling and areas like the WPL cauldrons that give you very fast levels.
---
Yeah I think things like that make that free time you have with Games/wow all the sweeter.
---
Well... You are going to see that ass for many hours... So that is a big factor.
---
On the other hand Horde could be fun too - did you Level to 60 on Horde before? Could be a nice experience.
---
Try convincing your brother to roll alliance you have probably already done... Try again :P
---
I'd probably just roll alliance if I was you - if your bro is not even sure he will Play he is the one having to make the hard choice of abandoning his brother or rolling alliance. 
---
Either way you Play Night elf and don't have to feel bad :D
---
I'd go with what you want to go with. Shadowmelt is a great racial IMO so you might miss that if you go orc.
---
Maybe on horde side, but still, doubt that would even get closer to match same number of mage players.
---
I have a feeling they are going to fix this even if its vanilla like. Some bugs will be just too overpowered they will have to change them. I think bugging a 60 boss for free loots will be one of them lol.
---
It was a joke.
---

RIP Server 2
---
Troll looks coolest troll wins
---
I was considering doing something like this as well
---
From my limited research, it seems like it not possible to do it from quests, but cloth turn ins seems to be available from release, so rushing to 60 and start farming cloth seems like the best way to get it done
---
Take the easy rep you can while lvling, but the primary goal should be getting to 60 fast and farm cloth or gold there
---
they will ignore my advice and downvote my comment...
---
but if any of them ever seriously raid at level 60 they will learn how right i am
---
If your older brother picks horde you have no choise but to follow him. 
---
Also you are allowing yourself to come up with so much questions about horde meaning you have no hate for it.
---
And sometimes evocation I have heard :) Yeah, I think classic is more about the journey, the experience and the friends you make along the way. If I want high octane gameplay I'll play a ranked ranked game of League instead.  Of course classic pvp is a different story.
---
no
---
He budgeted 50+ hours for 50-60. Seems fine
---
It’s really not that hard to stay awake for 30 hours. But I agree that 30 hours of sleep does not offset the harm you do to yourself by pulling all-nighters.
---
Its okay, the alliance had enough benefits in that bg. They could use a negative
---
What were these 4 classes ? What did you like, dislike, why, what content, what what what what.
---
Tell us more bro, I don't care about your sleep schedule :)
---
Warriors are the best tanks as well as top tier dps. Its the only class that is great in two different PVE end game roles. Its usually the most played but im not sure how many of those actually make it to 60. Playing back in the day and also playing on the private servers they always had more warriors in the stats but it never felt the way. Tanks were always in demand and a lot of dps warriors are usually brought in raids. People would usually bring more warriors than hunters/warlocks(pure dps/utility classes) for raids because they are so good.
---
There's a mod for that.
---
This isnt 2004 anymore
---
Yeah,  Timbermaw is grinded in Felwood. There's a camp of them in Azshara too but they won't offer you anything
---
&gt; It's like comparing Sweden with the US. They will never have the same problems and therefore will never have the same solutions. What might work for one won't work for another.
---
You are literally wrong.
---
Layers is literally the same solution as picks for the same problem.
---
I can't explain this to you simpler.
---
Honestly you're being obtuse.
---
&gt; The amount of people who will try WoW I'm the first month and subsequently quit is staggering. Layering is designed to alleviate this.
---
Yes. That's why picks existed to.
---
&gt; Helping with the surge of players at launch is just a side benefit of layering.
---
This is the same thing. Are you having a stroke?
---
I'm pretty sure I remember a time when stone skin slowed your movement speed when you activated it, and dwarves would use it just so they would run half way across the map when feared
---
That is true! And then they add in dynamic spawns or what?
---
I mean it is already tedious in the starting zones on those private Servers with 16k and crazy respawn rates due to dynamic respawns. 
---
Most Mobs in the 1-10 bracket respawn within 5-10 seconds.
---
If they don't do dynamic spawns then you are screwed :)
---
I mean yeah - you are probably like "IDC I will wait 10mins for a respawn to fight against 20 other People for the tag" but most People aren't and I don't mind layering either as Long as it is gone after a couple of months.
---
Also - when there is 16k People what about the black Lotus spawns? There is going to be 1/5 of the black Lotus per Player than there used to be. They would have to increase that too.
---
Blizzard hasn't yet gotten a dynamic respawn System. They would have to remove all of layering and make a completely new System.
---
Not feasible if you remember that there is plenty of bugs that still Need to be fixed too.
---
It is just too late for layering to be removed we have to face it. We can only fight for them to Change it so it isn't abusable anymore.
---
&gt; Tanks have literally never been a dime a dozen wtf are you talking about?
---
Please read this again.
---
&gt; The fact is, Warriors were a dime a dozen.
---
Warrior was the most common class in classic wow.  See this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbfsmt/most_played_classes/
---
Raid tanks are a different situation, but for tanking dungeon runs? You diden't need to be prot. Arms could do the job just fine. I will accept an apology from you at any time.
---
Might want to do more than stretch lol, that’s not exercising
---
I tried reading quests thoroughly once...I stopped doing it 2hrs in. Sadly there are so few meaningful questlines that it gets really tedious and slow after a while
---
No way dude.
---
I am not in beta but I don't think so. They changed it so some of the quests were left but not the collect body parts one.
---
BUT! You actually save time because you have to go AH to get cookies. So basically you can get cookies + milk from one "vendor" instead of two even it does cost a little bit extra. I have always been aware of this but I still buy milk from AH if it's not like ridiculously expensive.

I really just wonder how you can program your sleep. I'm having trouble going to sleep at the times I \*should\* be going, usually sleeping an hour or two later. Then, I've got trouble waking up at the time I want to wake up, even if I go to sleep early.
---
Chill nerd. Holy shit.
---
I had my Cow hitbox advantage all the way through TBC. Was fun in PVE being able to avoid melee range aoe damage while still dps'ing while the rogues QQd
---
TFT makes more sense if it's the abbreviation of "The Fucking Truth" instead "The Frozen Throne".
---
You may have been 22, but you're also talking about 15 years ago. Your memory isn't as perfect as you think it was during that time. You could always tank 4-5 mobs assuming you used a bit of cc or "oh shit" cds. You just couldn't chain pull entire dungeons like you can in retail.
---
I know the server groups included i think "6?" servers. We had a few NA servers bundled with oceanic. the name was blood something. Sorry if my original comment didnt allude to that.
---
However, i strongly feel like the devs will make the groups as equal as possible in terms of faction balance. As this would have been to "good" game design.
---
So faster queues solo bgs will probs be Alliance.
---
That i feel is the best guestimate based on historical evidence. 
---
I think others have posted that we dont know until we know. 
---
I feel my answer gives a good explanation and estimate to what will happen when bgs go live.
---
i don't think your memory is accurate. I played a dwarf in vanilla and did dun morogh, loch modan and wetlands. I was nowhere near exalted with ironforge at 60. About halfway through revered and around at the start of revered with stormwind and gnoemregan. Darnassus around mid honored.
---
I don't think there is any way to get close to exalted darnassus that early, espeically not as a non night elf.
---
Peanut!!!
---
Illimin here. Fraid I don't remember you, brain's clearly rotten. I remember a rogue named Mirabilis, and a female human frost mage who crushed the DPS charts throughout MC.
---
shaman dungeon set and its upgrade (t 0.5)
---
I think you don't think.
---
It is the ZONES of retail.
---
With lvl cap to 60, no flying mounts, and removal of all QoLs...that is Classic+.
---
Not retail.

---
Look into polyphasic sleep. I do this from time to time. It's where I sleep twice a night, but for only 3 hours at a time. You can keep this up indefinitely. 
---
There are two trick to it. First, start thinking about your sleep in 90 minute increments. I can get by on 4.5 hours of sleep better than I can on 5.15 hours. You may have to find your natural cycle, but it's 90 min in average for most people.
---
Second, get extra rest going into making the change. Get a full night's rest, then the next night just wake up for 3 hours and go back to sleep. Then try and do 3 hours and 4.5 hours. Then you are adjusted and can do 3 and 3, or 3 hours and 90 min. 
---
Last tip is to do the longer 3 hour sleep first. If you ever over do it, you just sleep through the night and get all caught up.
---
I'm well adjusted now and can jump back and fourth between full night's rest and two phase sleep. I sleep at most 6 hours total now, but do 4.5 or 3 hours total most of the time.
---
I tried several of those other weird sleep patterns and didn't do well on them. This one feels quite natural to me.
---
Different story in different guilds i guess, we usually have 15-20 rank 14s every server
---
Back in WotLK my little brother (was like 5 or 6 back then) wanted to play so I taught him how to farm herbs. Then I just went out to play football with my friends and when I came back I had bags full on herbs.
---
Maybe history repeats itself and my kid is next in line..
---
Its going to happen after you wand down your 10,000th mob. 
---
WOOSH.....WOOOSH......WOOOSH...
---
If you have any interest in PvP, I'd recommend swapping Divine Strength for Spiritual Focus. 10% strength is not a huge amount of DPS for paladins, while having the ability to cast heals without being delayed by incoming damage is absolutely invaluable.
---
Paladin tier sets were best looking sets in classic
---
Once I made a PvP guild and we actually were winning games and it was steadily growing, and then some guy asked to be a vice GM. I agreed and then came back a few days later to find the guild disbanded. He kicked everybody.
---
I don't care and just play for fun!
---
Druids are shamans with stealth
---
Obviously I don't have the answer for this but I would strongly suspect: Yes it counts as a new instance and I don't think it will bypass the lock out. But I think we'll have to see.
---
A lot of rose-tinted glasses going on around here. I bet first day Diablo 3 players crack-up any time someone mentions Error 37.
---
Pretty sure troll warrior is pretty decent for threat generation with their active ability.
---
Chuckled. Very vanilla
---
Actually being part of a guild rather than just joining random invites. I'm going to start a guild with a couple of friends and aim to be our main tank all the way through. I only ever played classic on private servers back in the day because my parents disliked the concept of monthly subscription to a game you already bought (cant blame them tbh). By the time I was old enoughto pay for myself dungeon finder was already a thing and I was more interested in pvp anyways. This time around I want to Raid. I want to get hit in the face by Ragnaros himself and live to tell the tale.
---
i dont want to achieve anything at all
---
thats why i will play wow classic
---
Sadly not but that would have made my account name even better! I made this account after reading ready player one so it's a little tribute to gregarious games whilst making a lot of sense on a platform like Reddit :)
---
I've always been pretty chill even when tanking, so I'm going to be happy sat back and stopping people dying whilst not paying for this and that lol
---
Lmao I know you never played Classic if you thought warrior tanks in 5 mans were a dime a dozen. Basically every pug group waited around for tanks and sometimes for hours. 
---
First off that link is a poll of 15k people asking what they're GOING to play in classic, not what was the most common in Vanilla. And even if warriors were the most common class in Vanilla WoW (they weren't because they were dog shit to level and then when someone figured out how to properly level them they got nerfed), that doesn't mean they were commonly tanking ubrs/scholo/brd because most warriors were dogshit at the game.
---
People did not commonly tank in Vanilla using a 2H as Arms or Fury. That's something that some of the higher end players did but became much more common on private servers and more specifically once you've overgeared the content. 
---
Your post reeks of a private server player that never touched the game beforehand. You played from Vanilla to WotLK? Maybe on private servers, never on live if you're gonna assert things like warrior tanks were a dime a dozen and that people commonly tanked hard dungeons with 2Hers as Arms. Tanking at every single era of WoW has been the most in-demand role, from day 1 and still to this day. It is not easy for pugs to find a new tank. It never has been.
---
I'm right-eye dominent, but I'm also left-handed so I'm just weird.
---
True, you are right by the time they make the server groups they can try to adjust them based on server populations.
---
I doubt you'll achieve anything in the first 48 hours, starting with playing.
---
Man I hate to pile on here, but I can promise you if you plan on communicating with anyone outside your old group of friends they are going to expect you to have discord.
---
Quite literally every gamer uses it and I'm still not entirely convinced this isn't a top tier trolling post that I'm actually falling for.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, but you should look into at least familiarizing yourself with discord. There's a reason pretty much everyone has migrated to it. It has great voice quality, the interface is great, and you can basically use it as a social area for you and your friends to chat and link things when you aren't actually gaming. It works on your phone and your browser as well. 
---
PS: I'm 31.
---
Weren't most bosses in vanilla immune to taunt anyway?
---
I absolutely refuse to belive that Paladin T1 was one of the best looking sets in classic.   
---
Warrior gear on the other hand....
---
So was mine. 17 year old me making a rogue main was an edgelord.
---
No haha
---
How are hunters good but shamans, druids and paladins just ok? Holy paladins are as good as priests. Hunters are the definition of being ok at what they do when it comes to PvE. Only reason you want hunters are because of tranq shot but if thats not different than wanting druid for innervate and MotW.
---
Personally I don't like alliance.
---
If your bro is going rogue you should go druid. Its a nice combo. If you were solo I would say go favorite race &gt; everything else because you have to look at for many hours. Since your bro is playing and wont budge on alliance  then you have to roll horde if you want to play with him.
---
 Don't mean to hijack the thread but if I could ask, regarding specs, I haven't played modern WoW so don't know how my computer will handle it. Do you guys think this is enough? 
---
16 gig ram
---
 Intel i7 2600K CPU @3,40 GHz, 3701 Mhz, 4 cores
---
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti
---
 Never considered that classic would run on a different engine than old classic. Worried now I might not be able to run it. My GPU is very old. I don't play any modern games so have had no need for a better one.
---
A Kel'Thuzad kill.
---
What I dont like about this is the implication that only new zones can be new content.
---
In 1v1 PvP they are goods. When it comes to BG's they are below average
---
Human racial only affects stealth. I don't remember if there's a potion for it, but you could always just cast detect invis on other people if they really wanted to see it.
---
So we will.
---
The times are weirdly labeled on the last three days
---
Crazy schedule. I’m a little jealous...
---
But he needs his rp PvP server for his cross faction erp
---
I've quit the game upon BC release and never bought a single expansion of the retail shit show. Booked a sub as soon as they've announced the conditions to join the beta and I've been lucky enough to get in. I'm having tons of fun exploring and wandering in the Beta and won't leave it until they manage to add space ships and crap again.
---
Banana boy!
---
How expensive is engineering? Wouldn't having mining help offset some of the cost? Or is it just better to farm gold and completely skip it.
---
So many masochists around here.
---
Honestly it’s more like watching warriors top meters at the same time being the best and only real endgame tank class...
---
I'm never leveling a warrior, the pain is too real
---
Again why would he roll on a US server?
---
This hit me right in the feels, Ed saying "ha ha ha" sounded perfect in my head in his dumb voice &lt;3
---
Raiding. Back in classic I just PvP:ed at 60 trying to hit a high rank. Had a lot of fun but missed out on the game to a large extent.
---
I think one of the elites there are for the scepter quest line
---
Better hope you have some people capable of being class leaders then.  I have had good officers/leaders and some really flakey ones that basically don't do anything (and nobody else in their class is any better).
---
Classic will turn to shit if they keep adding more islands.  They need to increase the real estate of the two continents to maintain the feeling of the world.
---
u/SockofBadKarma said it better than I ever could:
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal efficiency. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job done. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! For the Horde!
---
I have beta and I'm a rogue. You 100% can not SnD on "banked" combo points that are on a mob after you kill it. They fade pretty quickly on beta, but not all the time. Even when they don't fade for a few seconds, you still can't use them for and. This is one of the first things I tested, and I still try to spend cp on snd after I kill something out of habit, even though it doesn't work.
---
You're gonna spend a lot of time on that character, you gotta choose the one you like best. I understand perfectly the feeling, female nelves look agile and graceful. Not knowing the capitals adds to the novelty of the experience, alliance cities are beautiful and Stormwind and Ironforge are the pinnacle of epicness. Go for what you love man, 100%, if you play rogue or hunter. If you want a shaman, no choice though sadly!
---
For context, had to join friends on horde side in like MoP, I regretted it afterwards. I like alliance more, from the skins to the locations, and friends leave eventually, so you end up alone in a place you hate.
---
"Surprise mechanics"
---
Ehhhh but it basically is. These servers weren’t perfect, but strives to be very true to classic.
---
Nah.  People always try to equate them to the same thing.  They play nothing alike.
---
Selling arrows back in the day in stacks of 2 instead of 200 but for the same price as 200.
---
Got so much money from doing that :)
---
Bud, go ask your mom for another juice box and calm down!!! the OP was making a suggestion
---
It would really help. And i can remember in vanilla before cross realm bgs my mum and I waiting forever to get into bg's.
---
Priest T2 (Transendence) and Hunter T2 (Dragonstalker) 
---
Cbf screenshots, lazy
---
Yes, but more sad tbh.
---
I don't remember if it was in vanilla, but other holidays would use Small Eggs for some quest or crafting thing - I used to buy out the AH and sell them on [holiday] for 10-20x the price.
---
You earn DKP based on raid attendance, kill participation and/or being helpful to the guild in general.
---
When an item drops, you pay DKP to buy it, there are two basic forms of buying:
---
1) fixed price, every item has a fixed price, determined by the guild leaders, which may also be different for different specs. Everybody who wants the item says so and the person with the highest DKP gets it and gets the price deducted.
---
2) Auction. Everybody who wants the item submits a bid to the loot officer (which of course may not exceed your total dkp). The highest bid gets the item and gets the DKP deducted.
---
IN general, guild will also use priority lists to avoid people spending DKP on items not useful to the raid. E.g. cloth spelldmg gear is given to mages and locks first before a holy priest, who wants to play shaodw in pvp gets it.
---
Regarding Ashkandi, psecifically, I wouldn't worry. 2h weapons are pretty much useless to all the mainstream specs. Only a ret paladin can really use this weapon (some hunters may want it as a statstick). So, if you want to use in PVP, you'd be on the same priority level as a warrior who wants to use it in PVP.
---
That said, if you enjoy playing ret, you might want to jsut raid as ret. You won't get into a super hardcore guild, but raiding as ret would pretty much guarantee you first dibs on Ashkandi.
---
What else would I use it on? I’ve travelled enough and can’t be assed travelling much more, no kids, partner who works from home etc etc
---
You are wrong, 5/0/5 is considered a must among speed levelers. Then they go 2 points into shadow ward pain and 3 into spell hit. After that its basically back to disc, and respec shadow around level 44.
---
Wow is a game, not a job. It is something you do for entertainment to pass time. Wow is a social game, and you seem to lack social skills. Even in a hardcore min max guild. If I had to choose, I would rather play with a social competent balance Druid than a social inept player.
---
You’ll be fine
---
God no! Dont stop. Get to level 60. Take em for everything you can. Doecument everything along the way then post the whole thing on youtube! LOL
---
This, even if only for the first quarter of the right to keep threat down while the fury tank builds more.
---
Alright mate. If you're such a fucking expert, name all talents in the protection tree that give "basic midigation" and tell me just how much of a difference in incoming damage do they make. 1 2 3 go.
---
It's kinda expensive and mining would definitely help offset the cost but skinning is an easier profession to make money of during leveling, you're already killing beasts etc, no need to search for nodes.   
---
It's dependent on what you value. As a warlock you do get your mount for free at 40 so mining instead of skinning wouldn't be a bad idea since you don't need as much money, it's more of a hassle to level though.
---
Nope. If they take a cute girl that knows nothing over someone they think isn't "skilled" enough. Take every advantage of them then bounce. 
---
People like that deserve to be nut punched.
---
Dwarfs have big tits also RP in goldshire
---
 I was considering going alliance warlock for a bit. I don't see it as a drawback facing WotF. Reason being there will be less warlocks at 60, some players choosing not to roll one since they don't want to face undead which means easier to get a raid spot. 
---
 Haven't raided as a warlock in classic but I think the shard farming is a bit overstated. Warlocks are so good at farming mobs. You probably don't have to spend very long to fill up the shards you need for a raid.
---
Bloodfang
---
I haven't played Vanilla like the guy above, but the idea that Blizzard nerfed leveling and dungeon difficulty to help out people who now wanted or *had* to level a blood elf or a draenei, does not seem at all unbelievable.
---
I just looked at patch notes from 1.12(which is pretty much the TBC prepatch). And you can see things like
---
&gt;
---
- Uldaman
---
&gt;Reduced the number of Shadowforge Ambushers that attack after looting the quest chest.
---
&gt;Shadowforge Ambushers are no longer elite.
---
&gt;The respawn of the Stone Stewards has been changed to 2 hours (from 30 minutes).
---
&gt;- Zul'Farrak
---
&gt;The respawn of the 2 Troll/1 Basilisk patrollers should now be 2 hours.
---
&gt;Reduced the damage dealt by the Sul'lithuz Abomination and Sul'lithuz Sandcrawler.
---
&gt;Zul'Farrak Dead Heroes are no longer elites.
---
&gt;Theka the Martyr will now only remain immune to physical damage for 30 seconds before reverting to normal.
---
&gt;Antu'sul's Sul'lithuz Broodlings now only hatch 4 at a time and are significantly weaker.
---
&gt;Witch Doctor Zum'rah will no longer call as many Zul'Farrak Zombies to his aid when aggroed.
---
This is clearly in line with intent to make dungeons easier mechanically, so why would numbers not be changed as well?
---
Don't care either way personally, leveling warrior is hard enough as it is, though.
---
My brother and his friends are trying to convince me to go horde, but I told him to stop spitting that filthy propaganda at me. Always have played Paladin and don't plan on changing that. Bring on the auto attack alt-tabbing, dresses, and flowers :D
---
You’ve got to transition.  It’s your only choice now.
---
A good chunk of them were, yeah.
---
Great thanks for the reply. Any idea what my settings would be like? Lowest, medium?
---
*No rewards*
---
Most of tier 2 was great... hard to pick a fave.
---
Though I do have a thing for the wrath set... axe shoulders and all.
---
This is the oldest con in MMOs.  Go forth and conquer.
---
I played mage once. Absolutely regretted it. I hated playing a caster with 200 ping but the kicker was only casting Frost Bolt for the first half of the game. All my other characters were warrior which i've cleared Naxx 40 with as well as ranked.
---
I can't get tired of warrior. Great class for group world PvP &amp; BGs,. Completely trash at dueling but i've been playing so much warrior that I can get away with a lot of stuff I shouldn't be able to. Having a PvE rotation that at least has slightly more depth feels great. Being able to play multiple viable specs to change up gameplay is refreshing (DW Fury, 2H Fury, Slam Spec, Prot/fury, Full Prot, DW Tank, Arms). finally being the most gear dependent class makes the early game of getting pre-raid BiS feel rewarding while receiving big raid drops feel extremely meaningful. However with this said your raid consumables are insanely expensive compared to most classes &amp; your bags are constantly fucked because you need to hold so many gear sets. (NR Gear, Tank Gear, DPS Gear, PvP Gear, Engi items + Consumes.)
---
[I’m getting my hands on this. ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=812/glowing-brightwood-staff#comments)
---
Not sure what census data you've been looking at, but [wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com) has a good chunk more mages than warlocks.
---
Being a guild leader or an officer is something that you need to put effort into. You have to organize raid times, figure out loot distribution, recruitment, sort out drama, etc. People look for guilds to do this sort of thing so they dont have to. You need to have a specific goal in mind for your guild. You want to be casual and have a good time doing raiding? Cool. YOU need to set it up, find like minded people, and figure out when and how you are going to run it. What if someone doesn't show? How do you handle it? Lots of things to think about, but hopefully this wall of text gives you a little primer.
---
You're not a jerk, but it is pretty friggin' weird.
---
Priest tier 3 was lovely and understated.
---
Banker\*
---
The government\*
---
You would need something like wine plus a way to emulate the Intel/amd cpu architecture. The rpi cpu is a Broadcom BCM2711B0 which is armv8 so no. It won't be running on the pi anytime soon
---
Just continue and see how it goes. 
---
Yes you are a jerk, but for legendary items you do whatever it takes.
---
lol
---
Possible server imbalance due to current WoW trend of horde to alliance. This means in classic alliance will get instant pvp ques and horde will be waiting for an hour.
---
All info from beta:
---
&gt; Do they disappear when you log out?
---
No. Shards persist. Soul-, Health-, Fire- and Spellstones do disappear after logout for more than 15 Minutes.
---
&gt; Do they disappear after Tuesday reset?
---
I don't think the Beta had Tuesday resets regularly, but it did have resets and the soulshards did not disappear.
---
&gt; Can I farm up all my shards a few days before raid? 
---
If it works like in the beta, I can't see why not.
---
Madman
---
I wont try to melee as a hunter this time around.
---
Without looking too hard. Probably on the ‘lower end of medium’, to be safe Your specs are similar to mine (I have more RAM) and I’m sitting round medium.
---
Going to level both fishing and cooking to max level. 
---
I did neither before.
---
More females play Alliance.
---
I mean, im gonna take my time this time cuz i pretty much rushed to 60 to start raiding back then asap.
---
So dont listen to us old farts, rush if you want, slowdown if you want, have a great time reguardless! :)
---
Honestly peak hours are going to start right when he logs on....
---
Nah, the most exciting moment is farming panicked mages in wild PvP seeing their health melt like snow. I started to play hunter as a reroll just to kill mages but I enjoyed it so much that I never stopped playing it. I even bet on duels during LK and Cata and whoever wanted to duel me had to pay 50 gold while I would pay 500 if I lost. I played MM and switched to BM only for DK's and SP's. I made 7'000+ gold.
---
Ok sounds fine. Thanks again for the help.
---
The Night Elf Strip Pub
---
It’s free to play up to level 20 so go tweak it now for peace of mind if you’re unsure
---
I booked 3 weeks for WoW.... idgaf
---
That's creepy.
---
Is my math right looking at that schedule ends up with a /played of 6 days. You don't think you'll hit 60 faster than that?
---
Wasn't a problem and they fixed it... how? Seems like its pretty abusable.
---
GNOME HUNTERS FTW
---
Alliance has 4 good things:
---
- gnomes
---
- 10% increased rep for humans and
---
And in two years from now you find yourself in an online relationship with one of them trying to find pictures of females that you can use as „yours“ lol. 
---
I think it serves them well to be treated like that because they are all just creeps trying to land there but you also come off a bit weird putting so much effort into this whole situation
---
People have been doing this for a long, long, long time, dude. Go forth to victory.
---
Quite ethical.
---
Not in this context.
---
Unga Bungas
---
Yeah this... as a Rogue me and my other rogue friends always topped the dps charts. Until you get a dps warrior. How can one class be the only viable tank and also out dps every single dps class.
---
Very interesting and insightful. Now that you've got your data you can end the experiment.
---
Hmm...are you me in another dimension..I have the same days off from work and might follow this...kind of smart sleeping during the day while everyone is playing, log on at night when the majority go to bed.
---
Everyone one wow is a guy, even if it’s a girl. Women want to be treated equal they say so they won’t say they’re girls because beta bux will carry them everywhere and give them anything.
---
I feel that. Raiding is what killed the game for me. I don’t think I even made it 6 months after release. All I remember is finally finishing some end-game set on my Druid. The final piece (legs) took me 26 raids of some stupid instance to get. Never again.
---
T1 druid. I think this was one of them most authentic druid sets they ever made
---
Get guild bank access and take it all at 60. Oh and please document it for youtube.
---
If you're running in a guild, it's not a "loss" when your friend gets their tier set over you, it's a win for the guild, a win for the raid group, and a win for you because now you have 1 less person who needs that item in the future. Celebrate success, **not personal gain**.
---
I completly agree on this, I don't understand why so many people are obsessed by the *phat lewt lolz*, the goal of raiding is to progress! Loot is what helps you progress further and it feels really good, but it' not the ultimate reward, imo.
---
What are your guys thought on leveling, especially with a group? I was thinking deep ret is the best for solo leveling but sure about group play.

Making actual progress in raids. Clearing both AQ raids and Naxx is the main motivation for coming back for me.
---
In Vanilla I was in some terrible guild that had MC on "farm" which meant some weeks we would clear half of it. We killed Brood Lord twice and that was in part because we couldn't consistently kill either Razorgore or Vael, funnily enough the suppression room was fine for us, when we actually could get that far :)
---
I'm sure for some the progress doesn't matter and you are just there for the raid banter, but if you do it's worth learning to spot the signs of a guild full of incompetent raiders. I quit raiding in Legion when I suspected the guild I was in would take two weeks to down the last two bosses in Antorus near the end of the expansion, monitored WOW progress and it was about 6 weeks :/
---
You should set up a coup where the four of you roll Alliance and he is left to decide to have friends or to stay Horde.
---
Thanks very much for the reply. Did you submit a bug report? I know it’s not technically a bug but if we don’t get onto things like this then the hunter FD/trap thing might not get fixed either and it will just be chalked up to game mechanics working as intended.
---
To be honest I live paycheck to paycheck sadly, so vacations aren't really a thing for me.  If I can take a week off of work and NOT spend any additional money but have an amazing time..I'm ganna do it. :)
---
How about a petition to stop petitions.
---
Dreadnaught beats everything.
---
I don’t think you read everything. I basically said this is something in the back of my mind that I like personally but wouldn’t want it at the end of the day because it would open the flood gates. I played in ‘05. I want that experience. That’s for gate keeping though.
---
Now i want to play paladin !!! :D
---
But tier 1 made you look like a banana and tier 3 made you look like a futuristic cyborg space banana :(
---
I only made it to 40 before tbc dropped, gonna hit 60 and raid.
---
For paladins, no matters the specs, are healers/buffers wearing plates. They have their utility in PvP, less in PvE.
---
I rolled Paladins because I prefer hybrid classes over any "meta classes" (they are too much linear from my perceptive).
---
I'm not going to obsessively try to farm instances until I'm in full blue bis before I look into joining a guild that raids MC.  It's simply not necessary as a healer to be fully maxed out when most of the fights before Rag aren't particularly demanding.
---
Mouse just needed the poo say bro
---
Cataclysm was a fantastic expansion until Dragon Soul was introduced.
---
I’m sorry, 100 times...? Who would want to ever do that? Holy shit
---
BIS in wrath I think
---
I just wanted some information but I ended up doing this. I don't even know how I have gotten to this point..
---
I'd like to keep up with fishing and ideally be less of a douchebag overall
---
Im in the same boat, I figured Ill roll a hunter as a result. Wont be as populated as they were during vanilla, useful in many scenarios, super strong solo and got that bow quest that seems like alot of fun.
---
I would argue the experiment is to now find out how far he can push it in terms of freebies
---
Have a 60 Hunter and funnel gold to my twinks.
---
1 shot everyone in 19, 29, 39 brackets.
---
The ultimate PvP dream...
---
God I love these posts. Classic+ is my absolute favourite for possible content after Naxx.
---
/r/egg_irl
---
Hope it will work like that
---
I accept you have a different POV but what makes you n think you can be so certain
---
See how far you can get, keep us updated
---
Damn, are people really that afraid of wotf? Afraid to play warlock because a 5sec immunity, that can be used once. Warlock does competitive damage with just shadowbolt. That should show you are strong they are in pvp with the entire toolkit. Yeah undead rogue sucks  to fight for warlocks, but only in 1v1  wpvp; which any skilled rogue will kill warlock, until like naxx.  There are many knowledgeable people that would argue warlock is the best class in vanilla, just extremely gear dependent, like warriors.
---
Youre going to need to farm for many more things in vanilla than just soul shards, they are not an issue.
---
Id say orc stun resist is much stronger than wotf, but you dont see anyone afraid to roll rogue.
---
It can never be said enough; PLAY WHAT YOU ENJOY, besides ret and enhance during raids. Dont worry about a class being overpopulated, there is 40 raid slots, and they all wont be showing up every week.
---
Resto druids were very good in 2 vs 2 but much weaker in 3's and 5's.
---
Rogues were god tier in both 2's and 3's every season, easily the best overall arena class.
---
Warlocks were good early season but weaker later on. Maybe after resilience started reducing dot damage? After that rogue warlock was still legit but resto druid warlock stopped being top tier. 
---
Hunters were bad early but became ideal druid teammate later on. 
---
Priest and mage were always top tier in 3 vs 3 and decent in 2 vs 2 though both more or less required rogue teammate to really shine.
---
I've actually read the original comment and it's pretty convincing haha. Thing is I'm fond specifically of the Night Elves. And they are sort of their own thing, teaming up with the rest of the Alliance only because the Orcs started destroying their land. Even though I've always been Horde, I can't help but feel anger towards us when I pass by eastern Ashenvale.
---
Thanks though, will keep thinking!
---
I don't want to ruin this guy. He kinda has a big following on youtube. If I raid his guild bank. People would blacklist me
---
If the guild is decent you won't take precedent over any legitimate raid DPS.  Once everyone has the sword then others will be allowed to use DKP for it.  Well good luck there, because every single tank will want it for PvP, and every other paladin too.
---
I have played paladin extensively on a private server, owning a level 60, 39, 29, 24 and two level 15 Paladins (I have tried other classes, none past level 20 though). I only play Ret while levelling, but I occasionally swap to holy/prot for dungeons along the way. It's a massive waste of gold, but its purely for the fun value I get from being a part of dungeons.
---
Ultimately, I play this class because I love the class identity. I love the aesthetic. I enjoy not having to build up rage, I like the visual effects and the interesting choices I get to make with the class. I think the seal/judgement system is interesting, but ultimately as a Ret paladin I only use Seal of Command. I enjoy the random based gameplay of waiting for seal procs and crits, it feels fulfilling to min/max a lacklustre class and to try to overcome very difficult challenges. I like that I have an 8% movement speed boost as Ret, and I love being able to drive-by-buff people and dish out healing. It's the hybrid style that I love so much, and I truly just wish that the judgements did more damage (like, +5/10%). I realise that at max level people can take enough spell-damage gear to make that a reality, but I've only ever done MC once and have hit max with a set of strength/crit gear, no spell damage to speak of.
---
If you don't like the gameplay of Ret at level 20 with SoC, then you won't like it much more at max. While it can be argued that paladin changes a lot as it levels up, I don't think having access to Consecrate, Hammer of Wrath and Vengeance changes all that much. +5% crit chance is really nice to get though, and Reck-bombs are hilarious if you are on a PvP server. I don't know if that will actually work in classic, and I will be sticking to pure Ret anyway.
---
Final thoughts; If you are okay with auto-attacking everything to death and weaving judgements between auto attacks, then you can enjoy the class. Its not too demanding, which allows you to focus on socialising, cracking jokes and making small talk with people you encounter. If you want an efficient DPS class and want to race to the top, this is not the class for you. Your DPS is higher than people give you credit for, but its mainly single target RNG based and you need to find a nice guild that will accept you if you want to do raids.
---
If you have any questions, comments or want to learn more about the class and the levelling experience, feel free to leave me a response.
---
Tier 2 Paladin
---
Shadow is the best way to level.  Get wand spec, then shadow till 40, where you respec to go full shadow for shadowform, then put your next 5 points in wand spec again so you're really rocking and rolling from 45-60.    
---
Healing instances is pretty easy.  If you get too stretched out, it's probably because your group is terrible.
---
Definitely wanna get SoC if you ever plan on leveling solo at all, but if you're group is pretty organized for leveling maybe going down holy to get consecration quickly would be a good move. Can help the group out when you pull a lot of mobs.
---
Criss Angel did it better, you bitch!
---
All rogue skills, especially that kidney shot and cheap shot cracking sound
---
Just continue to do so, in a while you will meet a nice girl in that guild. You two hang out together a lot cause you both "female" you build up a strong connection, and since you are really a guy, there will be some sexual tension and you get strong romantic feelings for each other. she doesn't know how to handle this, it's all new and exciting but also very confusing, she drops hints, you think it's time to come clean, she takes it well. 
---
Both of you are moving towards another guild and continue to play together even other games, you really get some strong feelings towards each other, so naturally you guys want to meet up irl, she has to tell you something I'm not a girl either, you freak out, quit wow and your entire online world. contemplate life and your sexuality. meanwhile we can enjoy her perspective on drama time.
---
so yeah for our enjoyment do it. if you don't meet a girl go with /u/Ralthooor 's suggestion and record everything.
---
In standard circumstances it’s easily done in 2 to a little over 2 hours. 
---
If you add a bunch of people at the start, you simply skip the 1-2 quests that require a named mob kill or a specific looted item. Heavily grind on what you can tag or move ahead earlier than you would normally and grind on them.
---
Be a cow and play with your brother
---
I just wanted to be in that guild
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Of course not, I can't feel hate for the Horde, cause that's what I've played. Also, my brother is younger than me, so I'm not obliged to follow him. Whew, that's a relief tbh haha, still not convinced to ditch my Horde brethren, nor to stick with them though.
---
I feel ya bro, hopefully some good TBC priv server or something will pop up. I picked up vanilla cause it was free to play on priv servers and my potato could run it. Now I'd need a new potato and 15mo sub? Stoked all the wow fans get to enjoy this fantastic game but it's not something I'm going to sink money into. Plenty free games out there.
---
Sucks to hear
---
We did a modified bid system in vanilla. My guild had you earn 15 dkp per boss in a raid. When you bid on an item, bids were in increments of 15. You could bid the minimum (15), average (30), or max (45). Bids were secret to the master looter. If the highest bids were tied, it went to the highest overall dkp. This lead to a bit of hoarding dkp for some, so it wasnt a perfect system, but we all got fairly geared in the end.
---
 RemindMe! 1 hour "That was easy!"
---
Hahaha! Didn't expect the "she is not a real girl either"
---
 whatever you do don't stop
---
I was saying in another thread, tier 4 should just be tier 1.5 but catering to different specs. The warrior set is dps. The paladin set is tanking. Ect.
---
You run those dungeons for offspec pieces and maybe interesting trinkets/weapons that unintentionally become BiS in niche cases. Naxx raiders will still want rare materials, recipes, consumables, whatever from your new raid even if the gear isn't strictly better than what they have now.
---
Fresh fruits helps alot with joint pain too, factor that in, blueberries/oranges in your diet.
---
Dont have to raid the guildbank if they give it to you.
---
Don't raid the guild bank - just have fun - record everything and make some nice vids in the end :P
---
Just be yourself and raid and try not to take too much free stuff :D
---
Yes you are but let that stop you.
---
I'm looking for all those naughty secrets.
---
Everyone is very friendly and mature. I rolled as a mage and there are already too many mages so I have no choice
---
&gt;rough start
---
&gt;until 6 minutes after
---
.....
---
Tier 2 paladin is prob the best well worked art imo. That's how a lot of paladins sees themselves in that class fantasy. Unfortunately, how you'll end up is a totally different story...
---
I think low in the 5 days played is possible for warrior. But i'm a really shit leveler. I have my 1-40 route down pat to get ahead of the zerg. But my 40-60 is trash so i'll just relax for the last few days since i'll be ahead
---
If he is younger you should be able to convince him to roll alliance.
---
There’s no debating about tastes, but have you considered trying to enjoy the leveling experience? It’s quite fun even if your mentality is to get to 60 quickly, but I’ve found it’s even more fun if you remind yourself that the journey can be as enjoyable as the destination.
---
Just curious what do you plan to spec for leveling? group solo etc..
---
“Addiction” to video games is a choice. Don’t make bad choices. If you do make bad choices, bad things will happen to you.
---
He wasn’t telling them how to play, just saying that it can be fun to level, lol
---
Imagine playing undead spriest and only clipping every fight that you have Devouring Plague up (and it doesn't get dispelled immediately).
---
I love battlegrounds at level 60, where everyone is on equal footing other than gear.  World PvP is 90% ganking, and becomes 99% ganking after battlegrounds open up because all of the competitive pvpers on a pvp server will be grinding honor not out killing low levels.    
---
I fully endorse leveling on a pve server if you like to keep your pvp and pve separate.  I know I do.
---
Just rush that quest first. Get ur friends to help you out. The imp is great to have. I wouldn't skip it.
---
I guess we will remember it like we remember TBC launch days. that is
---
'' the lag was insufferable, people kept crashing, falling through the world or getting booted out of the zone, completing mundane quests took ages, every mob was camped by 3+ player... next time I think I'll just wait a week before playing. ''
---
Honestly, unless the information is impunitive to specific members, it won't ruin anyone.  Take your information and go public.  It's going to be far to tedious to continue keeping the charade long enough to become valuable.  You have proven your point, now hit a home run.  
---
Your better off going to somewhere else that you can just be you and have fun.  There will be a lot more guilds raiding per server this go around.
---
He can have the privilege on making a nelf hunter and name him “LeggolassXXX”
---
Go back to retail then if you want "balance"
---
Yeah, that would be the final argument IF I were sure he'd be serious about playing. Cause we started on a server where there's hope in the light, but he is almost never online. If this will be his "playing" classic, I won't factor him in, cause so far 99% of my /played has been with people met ingame.
---
You got em by the balls!! And you probly have a major hit on Youtube in your hands!! Go ballz to the wall and take this guy down for a ride!!!

Oh didn't know that. If there is no need to buy expansions I might download it then and check out. Thank for the suggestion.
---
Yeah starting zone were soooo crowded it was insane, but the respawn was fast so it didn't really matter
---
Weapon skill factors directly into the parry chance equation. With rate of parry being much higher on live that means weapon skill is still of critical important even though the functional "cap" is lower than pservers.
---
How many times have you wiped at 1 or 2% on a boss? Imagine then that you have 4 or 5 melee groups of whom 50-60% are doing an additional 1-2% (or honestly, greater) because of their weapon skill racials. It's cumulatively a huge difference, especially on a raidwide level.
---
Can they turn it on and off with deviate delights?
---
Not as easy with classic having nearly 3x the parry values causing them to insta die to parry haste until the raid massively out gears the content
---
Who's more sad?    
---
1. someone enjoying themselves doing what they like (such as speed running, etc)    
---
2. someone saying they are sad on the internet because you don't agree with what they're doing
---
They can have the dmg meters, I'm still going to kill them in wpvp in a hybrid feral/resto spec.
---
Thanks for your personal experience input! I think I might try out Alliance on a pserver to see how it feels while there's still time before classic.
---
Priest T2 was a true masterpiece
---
*Cries in American*
---
This is my ultimate goal for classic. I wanna be a banana boy riding rivendares deathcharger.
---
When they get you to 60 and ask for nudes, send them a pic of your manly hairy chest. Be sure to be holding a piece of paper with your characters name on it. So they know it is real.  
---
Then name change or transfer to another realm with all the free stuff.  
---
Are you  jerk? Yes, but these guys don't seem like the type of people you'd want to be in a guild with anyway. So you might as well get them to power level you with dungeon runs and stuff.
---
Say to him that youll make a rogue and constantly gank him untill he roll alliance
---
You're right.
---
Still it's worth 3% hit for a very small window in the game. Bows in general have horrid attack speed.
---
So yes, for those couple months between Rhok'delar and Ashjre'thul you'll be better off as a troll. Any other point in time it won't matter because using a bow will nerf you more than that +5 bow skill can make up for.
---
I’ve herd that if want to be in a hardcore raiding guild for vanilla that I can’t really be a prot pally and should just roll warrior if I want to tank... thoughts?
---
I'm ignoring them and seeing how Spelladin pans out
---
This is how Bruce Jenner started out, and he/she is doing great! Keep at it mate.. Godspeed!
---
&gt;Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor (I think?) which is different from the X86/AMD64 platform
---
This makes sense, though it has been mentioned that Windows 10 will be running on the Pi 4, so wondered if this would already be handled?
---
&gt; If you are looking to get away with playing WoW on something small/cheap 
---
Anything you would recommend? It's for LAN so small/ cheap is the ideal
---
We're the good guys :))
---
Besides the factor that if you can swap out edgemasters for something like goa because you have orc racials, it's more dps all around. You're speaking of marginal gains like they're worthless, when in fact it's what this game is about. Marginal gains spread across a large enough time frame or the cumulative result of raidwide implementation = big stuff.
---
Dude, get some help. (you're telling someone they're wrong because you don't agree with their viewpoints on what is fun and what isn't)
---
This is exploiting a market niche. Carry on. When they ask for nudes say you are under age. When they ask again, tell the FBI. Then whe. They go to prison for soliciting a minor for sex across state lines, loot the guild bank and move on.
---
I’m a priest and I pull with mind blast because tanks don’t fuck my mana bar hard enough and I like it rough. Pleb tanks better l2taunt if they roll with me. DoTs, HoTs, and smashin thots. Priestgang, scrubs.
---
Depends on the person i guess. There is absolutely nithing my friends could tell me that could convince me to play alliance
---
I think he thinks that ppl only pvp on pvp servers and dont pve ever
---
That's a slippery slope fallacy
---
That's a great point actually! It shouldn't be me compromising as so far on pservers I've been the one seriously playing, while he's just dabbling a little. 
---
Also, I haven't levelled up to 60. My highest level is a 41 Druid, rest are low level Hunter, Warlock, Shaman, since I'm also struggling with picking a class haha.
---
But bloodelf hubter is a better fit just in case TBC comes out
---
The difference between a memespec like balance druid and a non optimal race for a perfectly viable healer is pretty big.
---
A raid can carry a spec like that pretty far but in naxx I seriously doubt many guilds would be ok with it unless everything is on complete farm.
---
One of my friend recorded me raging screaming "SERIOUSLY ?!" because I was attacked several times by guards for no reason. He still plays the sound with his soundboard when something bad happens to me x)
---
Be patient. Thats all.
---
Getting exalted with AV was not a quick thing in vanilla. Not as I remember it.
---
Source: got the unstoppable Force on my warrior still
---
maybe in classic, but it changed in tbc
---
So then they can find a way to allow the Lock Dots while maintaining the Dot cap.
---
Shouldn't the classes be fairly balanced anyway? Why have an artificial limit on the Dots when they can simply adjust the mechanics?
---
Why make WoW Classic exactly like Vanilla when hindsight can improve it?
---
This is private server experience, so might not be 100% valid, but still.
---
I was in a guild with a prot paladin. We were pretty serious at the time, having all content on farm, consumes, buffs etc. During the week he would respec to prot, and he's one of the best dungeon tanks I've ever had the pleasure of playing with. 
---
In fact, as a pve bis geared warrior, he's on of the few tanks that could hold aggro when I went bigdick dps. He was INSANE for aoe tanking, and also did single targets very well.
---
Not really relevant, just wanted to give a shoutout to Sky, the great paladin tank!
---
His life is potentially in danger due to lack of sleep and gaming/screen abuse. This is illness.
---
Back in TBC..
---
i was looking for nethercloth in the auctionhouse. 
---
Everything lower than 3g was an instant buy.
---
went to the podtmaster, crafted some nethercloth bandages and sold them to the vendor. 
---
i got like 50s-1g per stack nethercloth. But it was a nice thing to do while idleing in OG back than 😄
---
Nemesis set for warlock was badass
---
There was a big scam going on on my server during Cataclysm with the Talisman of True Treasure Tracking, an item anyone could buy from a vendor in Shattrath for \~30G. It's a necklace claiming that ***"Wearing this, one might find the rarest of items in the most mundane of locales!"***, which people intuitively thought would boost loot tables it they have it equipped - while it didn't, and in a sense the talisman itself was a scam. 
---
Back in Cata a good chunk ofthe old playerbase had left, thus most people didn't know nor remember about this thing. So there was a random guy who started selling these for 500g each every day on the AH, sometimes even promoting it on the /2 saying it worked well for him. And people would buy it for the supposed effect while it did nothing, without even realizing they can buy it themselves for 10 times less money. That guy made a fortune out of it.
---
Thanks for that in depth answer !
---
So with that in mind, if you don't show up or drop below X raid attendance you will then have your loot priority dropped. So if you don't attend raids then you wont receive loot.
---
Easily done with siphon life and lifetap, takes too long to be a competitive farm but completely doable.
---
&gt;Everyone is very friendly and mature.
---
Which is why they think you 'not skilled enough', without the illusion of tits and mumu that is.
---
I question your interpretation of mature.
---
Fearing a melee class and they're fear path follows you the whole time you run away...!
---
The big whale sharks!
---
Rather do 1 because the stack nr doesnt show up, some can get fooled by that not thinking, i remember i did when skimming through and buying stuff in a haste...
---
Isnt the imp for humans just loot a book in northshire abby? And with everyone killing everything it would take probably 2 minutes
---
I think you over estimate the difficulty of those dungeons.
---
There will be tons of warlocks. All of them will be level 20 and sitting at dungeon entrences or world spawns.
---
I couldnt sleep for 10h straight even if i tried
---
Nothing worse than people who whiteknight women in games. I'd say you take the dudes for a ride and them expose them for the absolute chumps that they are. Seriously, this is the MMO equivalent of falling prey to nigerian prince emails.
---
There were many servers that were so competitive, account sharing was rampant to hit 14. Other servers ran a lottery system for who would get r14 to maximize the gear for all players for that realm.

T3 is one of the things I'm most excited about for my priest. It's far and away my favorite T3 set in terms of looks.
---
I do kind of envy hunters though because their t2 is, imo, the best looking set in vanilla and bis for a long time.
---
Used to do this shit all the time back in the days.
---
It's amazing how much free shit you get as a girl. Only ever typed, mics weren't as common back then.
---
Got several epic mounts worth of gold in handouts and left the guild later..
---
Good times
---
Absolutely agree and I had the same conversation with a friend.
---
The other conclusion we came to is them artificially inflating sub numbers for their yearly reports, but we totally aren't cynical!
---
End if the day it's money for blizzard, they won't offer it even though it would garner so much good will and turn around their perception in the fan base somewhat (which I think we can all agree are significantly more jaded than in the past).

Mage is the hero class of vanilla, very very easy to be good on, few keybinds, good in every aspect of the game.

Prot pally's have 2 main issues that make it difficult to get tank role in HC Raid Guild.

1. No taunt

2. heavy mana reliance, and the need to burn your little mana fast to keep aggro.

That being said, it is possible that you may be able to secure an OT role, and in some fights =, pally is the meta, but for most, pally liekyl wont MT or OT. Now if you roll casual raiding guild instead of HC guild, chances improve. 
---
Also, Warrior gaurentees that MT role is only limited by your ability. Druid, you need ability, gear, and a little luck. Druids tank a lot in vanilla. People always say warrior because there are no limits, but except for a couple fights, druids are just as viable as warrior. And in a few fights, druids are more optimal that a warrior.
---
Pally tank really really shines in dungeons runs. They aoe tank well, and if you like the early end game content, and some casual raiding, pally tank will serve you well.
---
Indeed
---
I liked raiding DS.
---
30/9/12 Imp damage build,and hitting SB whenever nightfall procs does plenty of damage.
---
Prot paladin is not in a good place in Vanilla. You have no taunt, poor single target threat, and big mana issues. While Bear druid has an (admittedly small) raiding niche, paladin see's basically no practical use in 40mans. If you want to MT raids, you are far better off going Warrior.
---
RP OMEGALUL
---
How is he a jerk? He pretended to be a girl and got accepted to the guild, nothing more, if anything the guild are jerks for being sexest
---
&gt;You are looking at the subreddit 2 months before launch, that's the playerbase who will be prone to minmaxxing
---
lol so true
---
You just macro all of your gear off and drown. Bagged items don't take a durability hit.
---
I’m just going off what I’ve seen in the clips of it. Where he was getting hit while strafing but not while backpedaling
---
That and once you hit 25ish holy isn't too bad with smite spam!
---
Is the launch time you have on your schedule US or UK time?
---
fucking cringe
---
Congrats you just turned yourself into a trap. Next step is to start wearing dresses and makeup, hopefully with a bit of work you can trick one of them into having sex with you, then that is the time for the big reveal and to show their recruitment policies are unconcious biased.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Congrats on having no life, family, job etc.
---
I just want to clear MC with 40 people properly. Back in vanilla I only ever cleared ZG and got a little into MC. I've gone through MC with a couple friends back in WOTLK but it was a cakewalk
---
Hands down Tier 2 Hunter Set
---
Dragonstalker with staff and bow omg /drool
---
Prot paladin is the absolute worst PvE spec in the entire game. Aside from warrior, feral druid is also viable, but you have to jump through a lot of hoops to make it work. It's also very likely that if a hardcore raiding guild plans on using a feral, they will already have one.
---
I personaly will go enchanting + herbalism on my warlock, because later on I'll think of changing profession to alchemy. I wont go tailoring because it is does not suit my char RP that well (yeah, thats wierd, I know, but it is important part of gameplay for me)
---
I am a casual player, so I'll take professions which are easy to earn money with, and herbalism and enchanting suits me pretty well. Just go out there, gather some herbs, disenchant some items and thats it.
---
Hes a jerk because hes not honest, but again, everything for them sexy legendaries.
---
There is nothing wrong with being a jerk, there is also nothing wrong with wantings attention of girls.
---
Wait for all the warrior mains to desperately try and justify this trash.
---
1/8 classes is the best at 2/3 of the roles...
---
People still do this? You would expect them to have grown up by now. 
---
I smell a Attention-Whore from 1km away.
---
Tauren nuff said
---
That's true.  Whenever I picture a Horde enthusiast in real life I see a person encapsulated in time still living in their mother's basement, still working at Gamestop, still fat, despite all the loss of hair and ambition.
---
The reading I did into it basically came to the conclusion that walking or backpedalling along with slows like hamstring all turned off leeway as well, so in theory hamstring kiting should work fine.
---
But I wouldn't be that surprised if the person who cast hamstring could be hit whilst the guy who's hamstrung couldn't be. Sounds like classic wonk to me ahha
---
Sweet! our guild is called &lt;Hamburger Person&gt;
---
Trolls are still superior for pure DPS due to Berserking. Two equally skilled and geared hunters, one an orc, one a troll; the troll will always out damage the orc. Just about weighing the pro's and cons. If you're going to be doing PvP, which most people will be in Vanilla, then an Orc is better. That being said, Hunters are going to be in the bottom half of the DPS meter once you're in AQ anyway, so squeezing an extra 50DPS out per boss may not even be worth it.
---
Nicer looking cities, better zones, better organized pvp and better pve experience. 
---
So let's address the cities. Nobody really ever goes to Darnassus but Ironforge and Stormwind both look like real cities. They aren't just some random collection of huts in a valley or tents on top of a hill. They're real cities and they feel like it. 
---
Alliance zones are just better in classic. The alliance specific zones like Duskwood(best zone overall imo), Redridge, Westfall, The DM into LM chain as well as Darkshore being really easy to quest in are better than the Horde offering. Yeah there's lots of nostalgia in the barrens, but having to go back there several times as well as back and forth between Stonetalon and other various zones gets annoying. I'll say that TG&gt;SPF&gt;HF is a great zone sequence if you choose to level up horde on eastern kingdoms, but the kalimdor sequence is pretty boring/bland looking. 
---
Then you have the last two points which are both because of paladins. An extra dispell as well as your faction specific healer wearing plate and giving out buffs with a more than 20 yard range make for a better experience in both organized pvp as well as raiding for alliance. 
---
Oh yeah and one thing that really got to me all the time as a horde player in vanilla was the annoyance of having to set your HS to kargath, a shitty outpost in the middle of fucking nowhere because Horde has really poor access to blackrock mountain.
---
God no! I wasnt suggesting anything that underhanded. Merely taking any assistance / gifts that are offered because they think you are a girl.
---
keep at it for as long as possible.  
---
once you have everything you want its necessary to reveal yourself to them.  
---
teach them a life long lesson.
---
He's an undead rogue. You really think you can find common ground with these people haha?
---
Does it really worth it? They are obviously biased, and you’re going to be tossed aside when they figure it out. Your character’s rep will be destroyed as well.
---
For me you have two options: 
---
1) call them out with proof in a constructive manner. You’ll do some good for the community since some of us do not want to play with them. Then go out and find a decent guild which will accept you - as pretending to be someone else for months is going to get pretty tiring.
---
2) as some suggested here... go balls deep. Record everything, make a YT or/and Twitch channel, create the highest quality drama content we ever seen and profit from it. Make a female persona at Twitch and stream it, while you allow them to carry you through instances, raids and battlegrounds, becthe little guild’s princess and suck them dry from gold, materials and legendaries. Proceed cautiously for months and at naxx patch make your grand reveal! Gain yourself a spot in the gaming history!
---
I thought dead mobs still held their combo points on them and that was how you did it. But I too remember doing this a ton
---
Wasn't in Vanilla either.
---
I remember being pretty mashed and logging in when I had got to Duskwood. I had to log out because it was too spooky. The combination of the eyes in the bushes, the spiders and the music was too much for me lol.
---
Looking forward to going through the quest lines in that zone again, such a good atmosphere.
---
Also went through the gate into Burning Steppes from Red Ridge and came across an elite dragon so ran away. At least 60 I showed them who was boss and farmed them for black dragonscales.
---
Yeah the actual release dates announced are all a lie and they just ghost released it early, knowing that only the true fans would be checking the launcher daily and could get early access.
---
In August they will announce that the servers are permanently closed to new characters and reveal the whole charade.
---
Best point, if he has been playing horde since the beginning sounds like he could use a change and experience something new. I played alliance in classic, horde in TBC and WotLK then horde on private servers. Was at first thinking of going horde again on classic but why do the same thing? Will be more fun I think experiencing leveling up an alliance character. On horde side I know every single quest inside and out. I would be like a trained monkey leveling horde again. Sounds more fun having new quests I don't know.
---
Huge gold sink, don't attempt until 60.
---
Not with that attitude.
---
Fuck 'em, god speed to you!
---
This would make for an excellent documentary.
---
If this is for disenchanting, your going to want to park outside a dungeon on a useful class that isn't DPS and Spam run it.  Vanilla wow was very good about avoiding these types of short cuts.
---
If you plan to try and Spam run dungeons as a dps, you will find this plan more than just lacking as any group traveling there will have filled this roll within seconds of first request.
---
I want to experience a real guild. I was young, and didn't play nice in classic. I was "THAT" kid in ventrilo, so I look forward to raiding and genuinely enjoying content with people.
---
Well just relish in the fact that in PUGS they'll end up pulling agro and dying while you just feint or vanish and still pump out solid numbers.
---
The thing is, it doesn’t have to be justified.
---
Yeah, I'm going skinning/mining until 60 and then switching.
---
Scam in every sense of the word:
---
Find a fairly highly sought after piece of gear and post it on the AH we will say 20g for this example. Switch to an alt and spam trade chat you want to buy said item for higher than it’s posted on the AH ex. 30g.
---
Wait for a sucker to think he’s going to make a profit by buying it off the AH and selling it to you!
---
I got way too excited thinking that they were rehashing these. Did a little research and found out this came out in 2012. There’s a longer, better one, on YouTube. [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TVHBXJIpvc4)
---
who ?
---
That total of 12k seems grossly overestimated since the XP that mobs will start to tank once you start outleveling them. Once you start being able to do the runs as fast as you mention your xp will probably start dropping to 10k if not even lower.
---
Horde outnumbering alliance? Did I misunderstood you? I would have thought horde would be in the minority especially on PvE servers, meaning instant queues for horde but not for alliance.
---
I can't really expose them. They haven't done anything wrong yet.
---
That would be terrible. Classic needs to be preserved in whatever form it ends up in.
---
That reads as super sarcastic but I honestly think it's praise.
---
I used to play dota with a dude that pretended to be a chick and used a voice changer, he wasn't convincing anyone but claimed he had a really bad mic.   I didn't play with him because he was a girl but because he had used his fake vagina to get close to the virgins leading tda and I needed that insider at the time. 
---
This has nothing to do with anything you said it just reminded me that I knew someone who did this and I felt like sharing.  Scam those virgins
---
Because game balance is irrelevant in an MMO.

---
This. Leveling pvp sucks but having your guild attack  an opposite faction guild for control of world bosses and high value areas like scarab Lord grinding spots adds a lot of fun and chaos to things that are kind of boring on pve servers.
---
I'm really considering playing druid feral tank. I hear a lot of bad about the class but have also heard that they can tank any dungeon and off tank in raids. 
---
Will I enjoy the experience of playing feral tank? Talk me out of it?
---
I would make videos of everything and once your happy and able to leave; release the bids daily as a mini series. Don’t raid or steal anything; just be humble and have a good time. They will be embarrassed at the end but you would of not done anything wrong really; I mean I have a don’t; but that doesn’t stop me from dancing my night elf female warrior on the mailbox in ironforge for some gold. Or don’t do anything and once you prove yourself as a good player; explain yourself to the gm privately.
---
No,  enjoy the ride and free gear.  When you get bored make a video so we can mock them endlessly.

Lack of sleep? He's getting on average 6.5 hours sleep over 9 days, that's more than enough for some people. You could argue that it's too much screen time but if he backs off after a week or so I don't see much of an issue with it.
---
It's definitely not improving your health, but it's not dangerous except in extreme cases.
---
I'm going Lock also...but I guess unless I get very lucky I won't be raiding because of it..
---
No U?

Mage, priest, Warlock undead R13 set

Then do the analysis, don’t ask other people to do it for you
---
Not entirely, but an MMO doesn’t need a 100% balance.
---
Ohhhh well I guess I'm slightly more right but I can still see half of the object with my left
---
Thanks I'm rolling a hunter now. Got any builds?
---
I’m rolling troll, personally. DP is deceptively situational, and touch pretty much just blows. Hex of Weakness and Shadowguard both end up being superior in most match ups. Similar situation with their base racials.. cannibalize is situational, since you can’t be taking damage when you use it where regen is a constant trickle of hp that’s supplemented by your shield. Undead shadow resist is redundant with the shadow resist buff you’ll already have, but water breathing can be convenient sometimes in world pvp. Troll beast slaying looks worse than it is, helpful while leveling and actually useful vs druids, and while beserking isn’t that great for your shadow spells it is really useful for when you get low and have to pop out of shadow form to heal yourself up. Will of the forsaken is really strong, but really only useful against other priests and warlocks, and you won’t be running up against a lot of warlocks on the alliance anyway. Troll bow/thrown weapon bonuses are completely useless to priests though. 
---
But overall I would say troll is superior, even though undead looks stronger at first glance.
---
\^ This. She might not be the funniest woman alive. But she's in the top 10!
---
I was never able to get the Bloodsail Admiral title in vanilla. Once I hit 60, I am going to farm this title.
---
People have mentioned before that there was possible nerfs as part of preparation for BC. They may have lost the data, but there are possibly documentation archived of changes and also developers who would remember. If the elite mob damage in 5-man instances was nerfed then that is a big change.
---
\*quietly swaps CoEl for CoS in rotation\*
---
you have no idea how many dudes did this back in vanilla, but honestly if you document it and make a youtube video at the end reveal that would be pretty epic lol
---
Then start a fair fight...
---
I did this and seem to be slightly right eye dominant.
---
Are people remembering this from vanilla or pservers? I absolutely don't remember this being a thing during retail vanilla (rogue with over 1 year /played in retail vanilla) although I do have some memory of being able to do it, perhaps it was in a later expansion though.
---
Imagine caring about DPS meters in vanilla.
---
Same here, forgot it for couple years but I always read it. Now I'll binge it fully.
---
Hopefully it works out for you =) I'm going to run as a gnome to Nelf start area so I'm fucked anyway ^^
---
You should know the context of what you were talking about
---
At least that wand makes it so that you don't have to sit and drink all the time while leveling like mage does.
---
OMG. She is great
---
Not a guild leader but ex-class and raid leader for multiple guilds from vanilla up to and including WoD:  
---
&gt; I'm aware it's something very time consuming, but up to what point? 
---
Completely up to you, I've seen GM's micromanage everything (which often annoys the guild-officers and skilled players) and I've had GM's who log in half an hour before raid time and disappear the second it went down. He trusted that we knew how to take care of the every day issues and sometimes extra communication happened via skype. Both aren't ideal but in both cases the guild survived and even flourished without too many problems.
---
&gt; Is there anything you do to keep your members engaged and not leave?
---
Progression is desirable. In a completely stagnant guild, people who think they can do better will leave eventually. Another thing that's killed guilds of mine in the past were rivalries between officers. High value players rarely leave on their own, often crippling your core roster and setting progression back by weeks.
---
DKP-systems also existed in part to keep players tied to a guild. It is a tangible investment made in a guild that adds another barrier to leaving.
---
&gt; Is there any preparation that can be done even before the game launch? 
---
Yes! If you have any IRL friends who are going to play the game, inform them of your plans. Having someone you know you can trust when you go on a holiday for example, is a must. Be sure to communicate this clearly to all high profile members though. The last thing you want is people accusing you of favoritism because you didn't tell them about it.
---
Another thing to take a look at are the various guild recruitment threads on both the official forums, Reddit and some other forums.  
---
&gt; What experiences did you have as guild leaders (or even as class officers) that you think is worth to share to others that will face that challenge? 
---
I've had 3 separate guilds crash and burn because the GM went on a holiday and the power vacuum caused existed rivalries to completely tear apart the guild.  
---
Also, be lenient towards players flaws as long as they don't hamper the core-activities but make your expectations clear. If bleeding edge progress isn't your goal, &gt;50% attendence isn't required for average joe but it is a must for the class-officers.   
---
I've also had great experiences in the past with the old-school process of: online resumé-like application, trial, member, core-raider, class-leader providing progress within a guild other than raiding.
---
Tl;dr: Leading a guild optimally is a team effort. Make sure your officers and you are on the same page when it comes to tactics,  composition, recruitment, etc. and to prevent rivalry between them. Do those things and communicating them clearly, can reduce the time added to a minimum.
---
Please record this and once you have achieved whatever you need to, or get caught YouTube the lot. This sounds like a great video series!
---
Also you are not the asshole here. The YouTuber takes that role. But milk that system!
---
I dont see how they shine in dungeons. I saw streams of level 40 stuff with a prot Paladin and it's always miserable. You lose aggro once and it's super hard to get it back.
---
Its easy, u go OOM in 30 secs
---
Gotta leave that sparkly trail everywhere you go!😍
---
Since everyone is doing skin/herb while leveling you're essentially just making items to vendor. Its consistent money but there are other methods to make more gold. Some people think bags do well and for the most part they are correct. Mageweave and runecloth bags will sell very well early on if you can get tailoring up fast enough, then grind cloth for the bags. I'd argue you could make more by supplying runecloth bags than you can with skinning. Someone ran the numbers and if you grind beasts almost exclusively to 40 you'll come away with 50g but you'll spend more time grinding humanoids for cloth if you want to be a tailor. Its entirely possible to make 1-3g profit per runecloth bag. Once a lot of people get to 40 and buy their mount, the next thing they will spend gold on is usually more bag space(the half way point to 60 is ~44). Take advantage of this. 
---
Mages will be the 2nd or 3rd most popular class. They almost exclusively level frost. Tailoring can make some incredible boe +frost damage items. +frost damage items are incredibly rare while leveling. These will sell well as the people who will min-max to 60 saving as much gold as possible are the outliers. 
---
If I were you, I would level with tailoring. Enchanting is a gold sink that you might never climb out of unless you obtain a rare raid enchant or are willing to farm a ton of rep (timbermaw etc).
---
Thats the way to go.  Shadow sucks before 40.  I leveled multiple priest. And by far the best spec is Disc  (with 2 point in holy for pushback heals)
---
And even there.. go Shadow only of you dont plan on doing a lot of dungeon.
---
Yes you can heal a good group as shadow, but as Disc/holy you can save a bad group and make it to the end.
---
T3 Lock has a great madness + bringer of pestilence feel to it. Love it.

&gt;don't show the damage meter

Not being perfectly balanced and having 12.5% of the available classes being the best at 66% of the roles is quite different...
---
Classic WoW is still fun, but warrior balance in 1.12 is fucking atrocious.
---
The authentic vanilla experience is pretending to be female to get in-game perks.
---
Battle stance &gt; Charge
---
People are brilliant... It's such a sterotype to say the hardcore players are no life losers who use wow as the only way to out themselves above other people but then they go and prove the fucking sterotype by doing something like this... You should 100% name and shame this guild.
---
From your post I surmise they already did “fuck it up”. You did apply and you got rejected. Then you made a (I assume) similar application and you got accepted cause of sex difference. 
---
That would be enough for me to call them out. You had a hint that they were sexist’s asshats and now you proved it.
---
I think, if blizz could, they would have never added layering. Leeway from the other hand is an issue I almost have no idea how to solve. I personaly think, Leeway must be fixed, because it will cost too much for casters, because of how insane the melee range will be.
---
Right on.
---
id donate just so see this

Is it his guild though or is he just in it?
---
Well warriors have disadvantages too. They’re trash as 1v1s for example.

don't spoil yourself the arrival to Stormwind through Ironforge! It was one of the best experiences I had on the game, the journey from Teldrassil to there is special, especially if you find friends on the way!

My friend and I did that when we were kids and I got banned for 3 days for it lol.
---
Free Action Potion.
---
If you are a warrior, you get about 30 different items. Only problem with a pvp guild, is you better have the gold during that week for the items.
---
Looking at the specs of the Raspberry Pi4, and only spending about 2mins thinking about it, I imagine the Pi4 B could just about run the modern legion client.  
---
The key thing here is it would only work well if Blizzard wanted it to. They would need to build a version for ARM targetted at some OS. In fact, the best way might be for Blizzard to build an image with the minumum OS components that are required you can put on a SD card and put in the Pi to run the game.  
---
Of course, this would take developer time from blizzard, and the population of people interested in this is likely to be very low, so it wouldn't be economical for them to do so.  
---
Attempting to do this with only x86/amd64 binaries isn't going to be pretty. There are options like QEMU to let you do it, but I  can't imagine the performance is  going to be pretty.
---
Because it has to be a perfect classic experience.
---
Wait for the rage when people find out they can get banned for the same racist jokes they used to make with impunity in public chat.
---
Goldshire RP.
---
Really though, it depends on what you guys are into. PvE? We’ve got Paladins and they are the most efficient single target healers providing some of the best utility in the game (Blessing of Salvation, might, wisdom, seal of light, etc). 
---
PvP? Again, paladins. They’re a beast on the battle field. Doesn’t really matter what class you guys role. If you make friends with one of these utility monsters you’ll have a better experience than on the horde &lt;= super opinionated line that hopefully helps sway your friends to the light side.
---
1. Skinning to 60
---
2. Pick up mining at 60
---
3. Level mining to 300, stash engineering leveling mats and farm arcane crystals for money.
---
4. Drop skinning for engineering once you can level it to 300
---
5. Once phase 3 launches, drop mining for tailoring.
---
Catfishing a guild.  Love it.  Hope it's not one of the few streamers I enjoy, but definitely expect you could get some mileage out of a few videos on this.  Sadly, once you out yourself it's over, so you gotta get all the footage up front if you go this route.  I look forward to watching if you do. :) 
---
Personally though, I'd just drop it and move on.  If these are the lengths you have to go to and the attitudes they have... why on earth would you still want to be a part of it?  Sounds like a guild full of white knight creepers to go from  a veto to bribing you to play with them because they think you're a girl. 
---
Head for open waters my friend.
---
Hell no, ruin those thirsty necklords.

Happy cake day

This is too good. The use of the meme is perfect and the artwork is so on point it's nuts.
---
How disadvantaged would I be by playing troll warrior? I like the aestethic and enjoy playing off meta races but aren't vanilla racials a big deal?
---
Mehh, agree to disagree. FAP can also be countered.
---
Can you turn the extra hitbox they get off with deviate delights and noggen? If you can abuse it with this, tauren could end up being pretty decent for PvP. Scatter shares DR with Freezing trap, but warstomp shouldn't.

The scarlet area in wpl where they eventually put the dogs starting zone. That place was stacked with hard elites and cool buildings.  I always found the places that lacked content interesting and scary.

Both options you suggested happened. If it was for example a plate item with only 1 warrior then there is no issue leaving it on group loot (unless someone wants to be an extreme griefer), but if multiple can then I've also seen ML used.

We did had a dude who pretended to be a girl for 2 years. With our current knowledge, the development of the modern (silly) gaming culture and the tools of streaming/YTubing this could be a great hit! Back then trolls didn’t had a gaming platform to do something epic xD

20/0/31 Holy / Ret. 
---
This is the spec I plan on mainly playing at 60 pve and pvp. Can anyone vouch for how it holds up healing in raids? 
---
How about open world 1v1 pvp? What classes would this excell or be weak against?
---
Would you change anything with my build?
---
Lastly does anyone have any resources or guides on playing this spec effectively in pvp?

There is an untapped demand for Ed, Edd, n Eddy memes.

Whats wrong is treating a woman differently (as a player) than you would a man.

I just want to point out that I'm an ordinary guy who likes dogs, military history and video games, who has none of the traits you paint me out to be. I can see your beliefs are being challenged by my stance and in response, you're trying to keep your worldview intact by demonizing me. You're attributing all kinds of characteristics of me, none of which are true, just so you can feel safe about blasting me with your copy paste learned hatred. Perhaps you should become aware of your own confirmation bias fueled behaviour. I understand it makes it easier to say these things about me by paiting a picture of your head that you associate with the stance I'm taking, while in reality it's just smoke and mirrors you're putting up for yourself.  
---
   
---
In other words, no *you* get a grip.
---
It's the danger aspect that many people find is the fun part. Spotting a high level lurking behind some trees and nopeing out of there undetected, only to run into a group of 5 rounding a corner and getting your shit punched in, I actually lol out loud sometimes. I don't mind losing endlessly to unfair fights, it juts doesn't phase me. It's the one time out of 50 you pull some awesome shit and 1v3 some people that makes it all worth it.
---
Same debate if I'm rolling Druid, and, honestly, after leveling my Tauren to 41 on a x1 pserver, I still can't get used to it. I thought with time the aesthetics would grow on me but no, I still have a hard time logging on him, bacause I just don't like the race. 
---
Only pro is Warstomp, which has great synergy with Regrowth/Entangling Roots, but it's still not justifying it for  me.
---
Otoh, NE has shadowmeld which boosts you stealth in cat form and 1% bonus dodge, which to me outweighs 5% more stamina.
---
On the beta and stress test, those quest mobs and items respawned very quickly. If anything, you must do those.
---
Tier 2 hunter looks tacky as fuck.
---
I like tier 3 paladin but not many do. I also ambivalent about tier 2 paladin which is blasphemy.
---
1. someone enjoying themselves doing what they like (such as speed running, etc)
---
See it as a quest to screw with their flawed white-knighting principles, man. A rare opportunity has presented itself. Will you rise to the challenge?
---
Knowing what classes I do and don't like will save me a lot of time from leveling excessive alts. I had every class to at least 20, many 30+. In that time I could have had a main to 60 and one other alt. Knowing that I will main Priest and have a Mage and Druid alt is going to let me focus on later aspects of the game instead of just level'.
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved leveling in Vanilla which is why a had so many alts, but now I can experience the other major half (or more) of the game.
---

We need to find that one copy of Vanilla 1.12 that is installed on someone's Pentium ll with 586 MB ram.
---
Prove it
---
Fuck it, you should expose this whiteknighting BS but you don't need to Rob them blind to do it. Would make a pretty hilarious video if they have built themselves up as this big hardcore guild and then they turn around and go full virgin because a guy with a voice changer joined their discord lol
---
Ram + saber &gt; wolf &gt; raptor &gt; kodo &gt; mechanostrider &gt; horse &gt; undead horse.
---
This looks true Classic content to me
---
This is gold.. Please deliver op!!!
---
I believe the term is "social experiment".
---
As I'm going to be having my first kids soon (twins no less), Im not gonna be able to raid as much as i might have otherwise liked to. So I've set myself some other fun goals for my time in classic!
---
· Level my Warrior to 60 playing duo with my wife!
---
· Earn every key and every attunement. Get known on my server as "that tank with every key"
---
· Make new friends!
---
· Get a full set of Dungeon 2 (once it's available)
---
· Swift Zulian Tiger... Long shot but a man can dream
---
· Frostwolf Howler. Doable!
---
· Hopefully tank my way to Nefarian. One day.
---
This is going to be a fun ride :)
---
This has to be a fairly specific event, how hard is it going to be for someone in this guy's guild to draw the dots?
---
Idk about “must” nothing is a “must” sub 10. 
---
But, if they’re respawning quickly then that certainly opens the ability to do the quests without wasting too much time. 
---
Sub 3 hours easy.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Warriors are the best at smacking things.
---
That's all they have going for them, though.
---
Not even counting the paladins that are going to try. I certainly will.
---
Screenshot or it didn’t happen
---
That is for West Coast NA
---
Lol you are an idiot that doesn't understand how classic ignite ticks work in groups and either can't read or doesn't understand the people that are trying to explain it to you. It's pretty funny.
---
Even the banana T1?
---
Patch 1.5 so same time as BG I think.
---
In each capital of alliance and horde there will be a npc with repeatable quests to exchange X amount of cloth (60?) against reputation. You start with wool, then silk, then...
---
It works for every alliance and horde rep (Stormwind, Ironforge, Forsaken, Orgri,...)
---
It is an easy way to increase your reputation with a faction in comparison with questing.
---
It's also the only way to reach exalted with Darnassus and maybe some others like trolls and gnome
---
The one change I'm behind is getting the wotlk version of her :)
---
Keep beating that dead horse.
---
They're already try layer cooldowns it's clear they are aware of the exploitation.
---
Yeah I believe Joana is a big pserver player and that might’ve influenced the guide. Even tho he played vanilla. I remember thinking the pservers was skewed when I started playing cause there was always people with other race mounts at like 40 and I do not recall that being common at all during actual vanilla.
---
TBC is when the headless horseman was added.
---
YESS THIS VERY MUCH THIS
---
I fell in love with Vanilla as a 7 year old by living vicariously through watching my uncle play religiously, he was in a top tier guild on the server and treated it like a job. 
---
He wouldn’t help me convince my parents to let me play until 2009, so from 2005-2009 I was his pvp / farming mule and I had no clue 😂 I just liked killing stuff and running around collecting stuff. 
---
He played most hours of every day. And when he wasn’t. I was. I wish I had a little sibling or nephew of age to use as a tool 😂
---
Leveling in Elwynn, Redridge and Westfall by itself is dope. 
---
Cities are more comfy cause not just a bunch of shitty huts. 
---
Gryphons are cooler than wyverns, nicer flight paths
---
Human racial OP for PvP
---
Nelve racial OP for camping, or anything you get creative with
---
And aside from what other people will add to this, if you feel like you prefer Alliance, I would advise finding a way to still go there. Cause maybe your friends will not keep playing for a long time after that and you'll end up stuck alone in a faction you're not comfortable with...
---
Get good, motivated officers and learn to delegate responsibilities or you burn yourself out.  
---
Also give them the necessary rights and trust to do their things. Don’t be doublechecking all they do. That defeats the purpose of having them in the first place. 
---
Don’t bring disagreements you have with officers to the people you lead. For them leadership should speak with one voice and stand united behind their decisions no matter their personal opinion. It’s really bad to have badmouthing and fragmentation. Don’t tolerate for example officers be like „we voted yes, but I was against it.“
---
Also get an advocadus diabolo that actively tries to find reasons why desicion x is a bad one. It’s more work then just having yes-sayers but they make you look at things from different angles and improves quality of desicions.
---
or 'PvP'
---
I'm a simple man. I see The Matrix, and I upvote.
---
You might not remember is all. I did it im vanilla, however it did become much more popular in p servers over the years
---
Shit you are largely right except i put mech and horse bottom shit tier whereas i think every horde mount is at least decent i.e
---
S tier ram saber
---
A tier wolf raptor
---
B kodo undead horse
---
F mech horse
---
There are only two things that will make you lose soulshards:
---
1. Using them
---
2. An ill-considered expansion
---
Vanilla = 2004
---
Vanilla extract = 2019
---
But you would be legendary...
---
*distant airhorns*
---
You should keep your character pantsless too.
---
The downgrade in stats would be worth the epic claim
---
I quite like the Tauren model and racials. I still appreciate NE too of course, but its the peripheral stuff where I also give it to NE, like not competing with silly Shamans, Moonglade being close to Darnassus, saber mounts looking better and so on. 
---
But there is just something i like about Tauren that isn't matched on NE.
---
Afaik transform effects never reduced ur hitbox in wow but I might be wrong.
---
So what youre saying is if you are are a youtube content creator in a hardcore pve guild that just recruited a female player and you offered to duo level her, give her gold and give food to help, that maybe  you are getting duped?
---
Ahh, well, that should narrow it down to all of them.
---
BeWaRe!
---
Have an alt that you play as [marked as offline] in case that happens, easy!
---
I'm skeptical on how useful instance farming is going to be in classic but the low level farm and list of stockpile stuff looks like it could be handy.  Thanks for the efforts!
---
The nicest thing about private servers is they literally are just as good as the real thing. They just need a bit of polishing to be absolutely perfect and quite honestly never needed to be ported to a new client. I feel Classic was just a lot of extra work for not much more benefit then what was already there. Maybe someone could enlighten me a bit since I’m not great with this stuff, but man private server blizzlike servers are awesome as is.
---
They are there for soul shards gameplay reasons only.
---
It really boggles my mind why people are so toxic towards others asking for a server to play how they want to play.
---
100% interested in this.
---
Say you’d reaaaally appreciate it if you’re guy buddy would be allowed to join (your main). Get good at switching between mics, and then one day say your female friend tragically died. Play the long con.
---
Or rob them blind and get disciplined by Blizzard like everyone else is suggesting.
---
End him now. Eliteism MUST BE PURGED!
---
Funny but also kind of sad.
---
Why do you want to join a guild so bad that you don't know anyone in and that clearly doesn't want you as a member..
---
What about strawberry?
---
So they accepted the girl you who has the same skills that the original you had when applied? Or is it just a social thing to have a girl around? Did you apply for the same role and everything, except with a different name and gender? Please specify.
---
High quality meme, right here. Unfortunately, we know all the retail tanks will do this, get mad that they wipe, and leave. After a few times, they will either learn, or weed themselves out of classic.
---
*at the gold shire inn with a bag of dildos*
---
Chris Hansen: so you weren’t going to use these... sexually? Also, mana biscuit?
---
This would only specifically change the tauren hit box tho. Most of the transformations turn you into the "normal" hit box races.
---
Retail currently is a minmaxing heaven, and look what has become of a it. Good balance between immersion and convinience is a primary thing retail lacks and classic has. Perhaps, this is a main thing responsible for the downfall of the game. WoW started as a fantasy world, and ended as a speedrun contest.
---
Imbertalifan
---
Honestly if they pick players based on gender, they deserve anything you can come up with, just have fun with that. I mean if as a guy you're "not skilled enough" but as a girl it's alright, then they're just pathetic. Also; it's as much a particular Classic experience than any other way to play the game. You'll have more suspense with the fear of being caught, more RP by playing a girl, and you can ditch the help if you don't wanna count on them. Seriously, just have fun, it's a game!
---
Then why are you here?
---
How does a warlock solo DM:Tribute? Don't you have to get past groups of elites?
---
To be honest I don’t remember that happening, but by then we would have been pretty comfortable in our patchwerk kills. Or memory is faulty, probably that one. Well if it’s in 1.12 it’ll be in. It’ll make first kills harder but honestly it’s probably not a bad thing since over all harder bosses compared to vanilla probably isn’t a bad thing.
---
Fuck it, let’s just call it Neapolitan
---
My thoughts on race and class based on the situation I am in today compared to 2005/2006.  
---
My plan is to take Classic slow. I don´t feel any rush to get to level 60 and I will most likely play alone a lot of the time, since the people I used to play with now have families and other things going on in their lives. Of course I will find other people to play with, but while building up my new community I want ot be able to take care of myself (if that makes sense). 
---
Therefore I have been looking at three different classes; Paladin, Warrior and Priest.
---
My question is what your experiences are with these classes during the leveling and the endgame. As a former Paladin-main, I remembered the leveling to be quite painful in it´s way, though I´m not sure if it was because of the class or because of 12 year old me.   
---
Give me your stories and tell me the ups and downs with your class of choice, both leveling and endgame. What did you do in endgame? Which spec did use during leveling and endgame? I need to hear it all.  
---
Thanks :D
---
Eh, I'd argue that. 
---
Cata was the beginning of the class homogenization. They removed so many abilities and talents and merged abilities together to remove unique class features (e.g. mark of the wild and blessing of knigs became identical). This did severe damage to class identity. They also removed ability ranks, which I personally see as negative, but I understand, if people like this change.
---
They also killed hybrid specs, as people are forced to put 31 points in their "primary tree" and have only 10 left to spend elsewhere as well as choosing a speciliazation at lvl 10.
---
The heroic dungeons were great on release, but turned crap with patch 4.1, where they returned to the old wotlk model.
---
And of course, there is LFR.
---
The raids, except for Dragon Soul, were great yes, but honestly, the raid quality is not where modern WoW struggled. Cataclysms homogenization, removal of class identity and LFR are however major factors to WoWs problems.
---
End game dungeons, farming, rep grinds, socialising and potentially pvp but that's personal preference. The endgame isn't very interesting to me though, so I instead decided to start levelling a new ret paladin haha.
---
Optimally, you could have a mage/hunter alt to grind the resources for your ret paladin, but I don't know if that's really a fair suggestion. Why raid as ret when you have a level 60 mage or hunter anyway? the answer is purely for fun,a and that point you've sunk so much time into the other character that playing Ret may seem trivial at that point.
---
In other words, I would recommend just doing dungeons really, but find what you enjoy doing and do that! :D
---
Better do this on your bank alt that no one knows so that you don't get blacklisted.
---
Call it the Wow Horny Boy a Saga.
---
It’s not like it’s the entire guilds fault though. Just because the person in charge of inviting people had preferential treatment doesn’t mean anything about the rest of them.
---
It does not which is why we shouldn't be putting points into it until later depending on which route you're going for. 
---
At first glance it looks like a great talent, but things will die faster than the SW:P takes to do its extra damage (for the most part) until mid 20's and 30's. This is one of the reasons I'm actually going to be following a disc build until 42 when i re-spec into shadow.

---
Sigh. I don't know why I bother.
---
First ... you are making way too many assumptions. Thinking one system that accommodates a few THOUSAND players will work just as fine for MILLIONS of players is moronic. There might be hundreds of "picks" to choose from. That seems like a UI nightmare.
---
Second ... Blizzard already added a cooldown to layer-hopping to cut down on exploiting. So I'm not sure how being able to CHOOSE a pick on cooldown (rather than "begging for invites") will help with exploitation. It sounds like every X minutes you can just change "picks." Seems EASIER to exploit.
---
Third ... assuming users will not make mistakes is naive. If a program can do this in the back-end more seamlessly, it will work much better. And is a better user experience.
---
Fourth ... helping with the surge of players at launch is NOT the same thing as helping to maintain server balance/health 6 months after launch. When people talk about concerns at launch, they mean overpopulated starting zones and mob competition. These can be solved in a bunch of different ways -- and layering is NOT intended to address this primarily. The real issue is Blizzard has a ROUGH IDEA of how many people will play Classic at launch and NO IDEA how many will continue playing. If they open with 100 servers and 70% of the people quit in the first 6 months, there will not be a single healthy server left. If they open with 10 servers, each with 10 layers (servers within servers) then they can manipulated balance while people join/leave the game and there is a much more likely chance that when the dust settles, the servers won't require merging.
---
But thanks for your suggestion. I am positive no one at Blizzard knows or understands what competitors are doing and I am just as equally sure that some random commentor who has ZERO data will know the best solution for a problem he doesn't even understand ... thank goodness for Reddit.

They have the best aoe threat, and dungeons are full of threat. In low level dungeons, all tanks lose thrat on an addhere or there, it isnt a big deal because these adds go down fast and the fights are short. and your only level 40 and few tanks at sub-end game content are prot speced or geared. usually its a tank class with an off set they hobbled together, using their leveling talents. 
---
But, I ment in end game dungeons. A pally tank, geared and talented for tanking does a great job holding aoe threat from what I have experienced and read. They make dungeon farm runs a little easier (Although slower from having to drink every fight)
---
He is. Ten man ubrs is easy. All the 1.12 dungeons are easy. They got retuned a lot by 1.12.
---
Yeah I applied as a frost mage and I told them that I can play 3 days a week.
---
Retribution duo leveling with another Retribution paladin friend. We aim to just have fun really, but loving dungeons so much we are both going to be hybrids, one of us will be Holy/Ret, the other Prot/Ret, so that we can flexibly tank or heal for any group. Prot Tanking isn't perfect but I've gotten through SM many times just fine.

Yes, I'm also looking forward to WoW: Classic Vanilla!
---
Thanks! I’m intending to do the same but likely holy smite build. I have now found some other posts/comment threads suggesting that it does increase damage done strictly because the per tick amount stays the same and it adds 1/2 ticks. This doesn’t counter your point that 18 vs 24 seconds is (ideally) not important while leveling. Does that seem right?

It definitely isn’t the only way to hit exalted - at least not that I can recall.

I hit exalted with gnomes and darnassus and never did turn ins. Pretty sure you can get some rep from doing pvp.

Going to duskwood for the first time to do the alcohol collection quest was absolutely terrifying since you're probably 5-8 levels too low and just about every with, spider and stitches could nearly 1 shot you.

I suppose at the time people wouldn't have known the best strats or raid composition, so would be more likely to try and cheese things. Either way I never raided in vanilla so am excited to try it!

Well, turns out I'm wrong on the plus hit.  Odd though I raided with several similarly geared troll hunters in MC and BWL and smoked them all on DPS on my Orc hunter.  Of course that was before they made the orc racial AP buff melee only.

I just want my rendez vous with the woman in the red dress.

Siphon life, Agony, Corruption, Rain of fire with Daze and stun talent, it works quite well, you can also pull more packs including the first boss and just DoT him up plenty, its a free brilliant shard basicly. (Skinning/Enchanting recommended for this farm as warlock)
---
Undead, horse and strider are all dreadful tbf.
---
Mounts barely matter if you dungeon grind because youre inside dungeons all the time.
---
You would just cut the time of traveling to a new dungeon.
---
thank you. I actually played WC2, WC3, and TFT, but I never thought of the abbreviation, nor did I remember any Pandarian references..
---
I'm a big RPer. Back during vanilla I was part of an orc only guild that was anti-Thrall. It's become a staple of my RP realms for orcs to form orc only guilds and it now drives me nuts. I want to (help) form a guild that's happy with Thrall, supports him, and has an open arm policy for all races. That's my goal.
---
A lot of typos but it is interesting. I picked everything that I thought would be warrior to see if I could fix the result and I got mage. Very confused haha
---
At each capital city there will be a faction you can turn cloth in to.
---
If you care that much about rep absolutely level in their starting zone and do as many quests of theirs as you can at the lowest practicable level!
---
Why not just use the robe to raid, and take it off for everything else you do?
---
I definitely remember doing it too.  But its been a long time since i've played.
---
Yeah I feel the same way except when it comes to WotF. I'm not entirely sure it's worth going troll just because WotF is so strong imo.
---
Yes you get some rep for those faction from completing quests in AV. You can also get to exalted with darnassus by doing the morrowgrain quest. Preferably before level 53 i think when it should start giving less rep per turn in. It's pretty tedious though.
---
According to the tool, living essence sell for 20 silver, hehe. (I dont trust private server gold values at all for this reason.)
---
I thought this too but everyone says the beta has 2/3 alliance, 1/3 horde, yet horde have considerably longer queue times.  Then other people say its a 50/50 split, but the horde still have longer queue times.  I'm not sure how that math works out.
---
I SEEWHAT U DID THERE.  BUT I AM ~~ALPHAR~~ GAVIOUS!
---
The addition of tricks of the trade, in tandem with my hunter buddy and my feral friend in wrath meant for angry raid groups.. Fun times
---
Gonna clear Naxx pre-bc hopefully!
---
You mean....
---
Shadow word pain
---
Mind flay
---
Vamp embrace
---
Devouring plague
---
Mind blast
---
Power word shield
---
Mana burn
---
Dispel
---
Inner fire....
---
Not including if you phase out of shadow form which does happen.
---
We pay our orcs and gnomes a fair wage and don't hope the handouts let them live!
---
Yeah I saw after. Could not go back and controll. Hope you liked it! maybe rethink about mage then ;p
---
Player skill is probably the big factor, and the racial perhaps. The rotation changes when you're playing a Troll hunter due to autoshot clipping issues, so if they weren't aware of that, it would hurt their dps more than it helped them. In an ideal world with two equally geared and skilled hunters, one orc, one troll; the troll would always come out ahead from a pure numbers perspective.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ Sorry buddy, don’t know what to tell you. I’ll see if I can find a old screen shot or something. I haven’t touched WoW in years and never touched a private server. I think I quit in 2009? I might have a photo from the first time I led my guild into getting an ZA speedrun bear. Perhaps our first Rag. Do achievements have any timestamps for classic? I had a bunch of old tier gear on my hunter and warrior but I would need to reinstall the entire game. 
---
*shrug*
---
Really, the fact is... I don’t need you to believe me. I really don’t. I did the fights, spend hundreds of hours sitting on my ass raiding, farming resist gear, farming faction, leveling tinkering, ect. Fuck I remember the bullshit that went into needing **PVP** gear for Kil’Jaden tanking Subwell, or farming fucking Maradon for NR gear for Princess Huhuran and her poison bolts. I remember how much of a PITA the first boss was initially in BWL because of the time cap or kick. I did the raids. The memory’s are fuzzy, but I they are still there.
---
Finishing Benevolance quest this time.. despite the parts in my inventory :(
---
I was a hardcore guild Raid Leader in all of Burning Crusade. One of the things that I think really lead to our success was how clear we were on rules.
---
- No Drama in the Ventrilo. If there was something that needed to be discussed, it went to a locked channel and people hashed it out in private.
---
- No changing the raid strategy mid fight because of wipes. A lot of other raiders are going to have a strategy in mind, but if everyone tries to lead, it becomes a huge problem. The best thing to do, in my opinion, is listen to someone's advice if you feel like you need it, but be ready to tell them no suggestions until after the raid. Too many people coming up with ideas on the Vent/discord just confuses everyone.
---
- Just make a decision. Sometimes a decision has to be made. Just make one! Too much wasted time is a nightmare and that will grind on your guildmates more than anything. If you say "hey everyone get here in 15-45 minutes" and some people are there in 15 minutes and some are there in an hour, that's a lot of downtime. Make concrete answers for everything.
---
- My guild had 5 officers. We never made ANY major decisions without 3 total people approving. And we never made ANY decision at ALL without 1 other officer approving your action. Wanted to take items from the guild bank and made shadow resist armor that we 100% need? Gotta ask for approval from 1 other person. Doesn't matter how small the decision is. Its THE guild. It's not YOUR guild. Other people are contributing so it's only reasonable you check yourself on everything you're doing.
---
I am sure there are other things that come to mind, but that was what was on the surface! Hope it's helpful to you in some way.
---
I did too, but it was so boring to level one I switched to mage.
---
All you do is dots, when you level as shadowbolt has way too much cast time.
---
Spriests are FUMING right now
---
xD cute that you answered
---
No I'm Midlands 😂
---
Played dwarf holy priest(still my mail btw) in vanilla, gonna play it in classic. I just ignore every comparisson and +/- guides and roll whatever I like. 
---
Why dwarf priest? Is that because fear ward? Is that because holy priest is strong? Nah, I didnt know about this minmaxing shit. I just used my favourite process to choose a fantasy RPG character: 
---
Is there faction with dwarfs? If yes, pick it. 
---
Are dwarfs playable? If yes, pick him. (yeah I love dwarfs)
---
Can dwarf be support? If yes, pick the role/class. (Why support? Because I being supportive. In WHO I played Runepriest. In LoL my favourite roles were support and jungler.)
---
Ok, dwarf priest looks nice. I will be the holliest of dwarfs.
---
Buy out ah up to some point.   
---
Put it up as lowest thats still up(should be high enough so you average out enough provid)  
---
Spam tradechat with 2nd char that you buy it for more.
---
This works way to often
---
How so? That was part of the timeline.
---
Hello, I also have this problem. Plz send fix.
---
Glad to help :)
---
Best dps... in raids.  In dungeons you are likely to be tanking since unless you have a druid doing the job (and even then...) you'll be out. You may bring damage but the lack of CC and utility are a tough sell, especially when you're likely to be fighting for gear with the actual tank (and even the healer if ally due to pallies).
---
The game is more fun with friends. I prefer the alliance more, but always played horde because of my group of friends. But if it was just 1 other person, like in you case, id roll ally. You wont convince the die-hard horde players of ever going alliance. They have actual hate for alliance players. Hordies will see an alliance sticker on somebodys car and become irate and start attacking it with a crowbar, while foaming at the mouth.
---
I will be playing alliance this time around though, regardless if my friends come back or not.
---
Warriors have sexy dad energy.
---
Yeah, not a great quiz to be honest. A lot of random questions that don’t really fit, and I chose specific answers that all lean towards playing a warrior and got priest or shaman. Something is off in your scoring
---
Quick reminder, there will be more than 4times the amount of players sharing the same economy.
---
100gold for mounts will be a joke.
---
Rip Mstrnasty. Fantastic all around dude and guild leader on Dath'Remar US.
---
&gt; Pulling like 4 mobs and tanking with a 2hander was simply not a thing in real vanilla 
---
And where is this a thing? Are you talking about the Classic beta streamers who go back to farm SM armory lvl34 mobs as a BiS geared lvl40 character?
---
I’m not gonna no-life a warrior to lvl 20 just to instead make a Druid, that I then level to 60 purely in bear form and fall behind all my friends by weeks in the end. 
---
This time, I’ll stick to whatever I choose, and read up on effective leveling builds and keep my professions relevant. Really looking forward to it this time around.
---
So was the pvp grind - yet I hit rank 11 three times on the same character.
---
I enjoyed pvp and just got the rep naturally
---
I'm going in solo for this one; in terms of factions and such I prefer Horde I think.
---
Are you trying to play tank or dps? Troll tanks have the highest potential threat per second generation due to berserking and how it increases attack speed. As a dps, berserking isn’t as strong, but it’s not like you can’t do good dps as a non-orc.
---
Play different classes since I can not hardcore raid like I used too. Not really care as much as being the best player around and just do my BGs, dungeons, pug some raids as I go.
---
Also when I was a young 15 and my guild downed Rag as the 3rd alliance guild to do so I was so f'ing pumped. I want to just down Rag again, even just once. We eventually cleared BWL and some Naxx but thats all I want. Rags hammer in the lava.
---
? No one asks that
---
After freedom you hamstring lol
---
I think it was meant to be used for the Varian Wrynn rescue quest but that never ended up making it into the game. You find Varian trapped there and you just have to leave him :(
---
Gets fun when you start sending out those BANGING Exorcisms in Plaguelands!!!!
---
Ah, I guess you must be taking this personally. Well, if I can't joke around you and you want the serious, yet obvious answer, here goes:
---
Of course I tried to convince my brother to try Alliance.
---
I started with the fact that so far we've only played Horde and now would be a good time to respect my preference and do a switch;
---
I offered for us to play around a bit on a pserver, to at least get a feel of the faction;
---
I tried to argue that if he doesn't want to comply with my preferences, to maybe take into consideration what a friend of ours (also likely to play) is going to choose, so that if he goes Ally, then the choice can be decided according my majority voting;
---
Finally, I presented the idea of deciding this on rock-paper-scissors/flip a coin game.
---
He rejected all of the offers without giving it a second thought. And now after having written this reply, it seems like I'm bitching about my brother's choices, yet in the OP I've made it clear that he might not even play, so this is a lesser factor overall. 
---
So do you think I've made myself clear enough on the convincing my brother side of things?
---
I am struggling mightily to choose.  I basically want to play every class lol.  
---
I think i've got it narrowed down though to a fem orc rogue w/ mining and eng as my main, a tauren druid as my bank alt / herb / alchemist and an undead mage for money grinding and bag crafting / disenchanting.  
---
That should keep me busy for a few years lol.
---
I just think Rogues are too fun not to play one on a classic PVP server.  Mage was my first and most loved class.  Can farm tons of gold with him.  And the druid (which i never played beyond level 20) will make for a versatile 5 man dungeon grinder.      
---
I guess my answer to the OP is when you can't pick one class, pick a few.  I'll still have a main, but they'll all get to 60 eventually.
---
You mean, it's intended to solve initial overpopulation in all the zones..? If it's even an issue.
---
Hahah ah oke oke. Interesting. Warrior is a pretty hardcore choise tbh. It was ment to be a niché class in my quiz. Would need a link to review your questions
---
Warrior T3, Rogue T3, Rogue T2.
---
In that order for me.
---
Nah man... 5/5 into wands make all the difference in the world.
---
I had too many alts, never hit end game to raid in time. 53 Paladin, 40 something Hunter, and then started making twinks for each BG bracket rather than finish leveling. TBC hit before I ever had a 60... I know my journey to 60 will be slow, but I'm happy this time no expansion will release and ruin my ability to enjoy the raids while they are still relevant. No matter how long it takes me, there will still be a vanilla end game at the end of the road.
---
I had it on a private vanilla server so it’s probably possible.
---
&gt;our son is 1 month
---
That's no excuse you casual
---
For me personally it is because writing english is fine, but speaking on discord or teamspeak in english is way more complicated and this makes things like random raids a bit complicated because glhf finding 40 german speaking people on a multi language server or try to communicate with people who don't speak english as good but still join your group.
---
So you (and Alzarry) illegally downloaded one of the most renowned games ever, which you admit is AMAZING...but you are not paying for it (even though it's only a couple bucks)? Kinda pathetic tbh
---
Plus, you get added to everyones friend list as "that crazy dude leveling as holy..invite to group asap"
---
Because it wouldn't go off of population. It would go off of population of players queuing.
---
Huh. This an actual occurrence? Amazing how influencial this game is, reminds me of Eastern European football fans - molotov cocktails on the field and all.
---
Paladin T2 &gt; Warrior T3 &gt; Pally/Warrior pvp gear &gt; the rest
---
That is some crazy luck lol. Not playing since TBC and getting beta access?! Jelly man. I agree.
---
Yes,but that Undead tho
---
I totally get that the color palette and overall design of hunter t2 can be off-putting, but it's always been my personal favorite. 
---
I actually agree with you about paladin t3. It's right behind priest for me.
---
I hope you're still in school, brother.
---
No changes!
---
What is the worst possible race/class combo?
---
Naxx was wotlk
---
Some people have given good advices! There's still time until classic, and I will be checking out the Alliance experience unofficially. You never know until you try, right?
---
You can’t buy it right now dumbass. 
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20769649207
---
Haha I got some decent classic time in, but only early stuff. I also leveled a warrior my first go around lol. So probably took me way longer than it should have lol
---
freedom lasts 16 sec and has 20sec cd. You have a grand total of 4sec of slow, which the paladin can wait out with hammer of justice and repentance twice per minute. So, all in all, you have an effective 4sec of hamstring per minute of combat.
---
Sounds like there is just some bias on your end, probably. Warrior is typically one of the highest population classes
---
So usually, if you want a spec that can heal in pve and is good in PvP as a priest, 31/0/20 is my go-to spec. It’s similar to the PvE shadow weaving PI spec, but certain talents can be moved around for increased pvp performance. With this spec, you get mind flay, blackout, and 5/5 shadow weaving. It allows you to do decent damage for 1v1 situations, and you keep a lot of the support aspect of priest via PI and other discipline talents. The main drawback of this spec is that you don’t have the talent to reduce the cast time of heal/greater heal (so they’re a 3 sec cast time instead of 2.5 sec). You rely more on flash heal, but in PvP you tend to not cast greater heal as much simply due to the long cast time which leaves you vulnerable to kick/CS. 
---
Trispec has some popularity as it’s more of an all-around spec, but in my opinion, being able to PI a caster buddy in PvP can make for some amazing big crit 2 shot scenarios (if with a mage or lock). You typically won’t have more than ~20 points to put into shadow due to the talents you want in the other trees.
---
It's intended to maintain server health 6 months (+) after launch.
---
Brave words for someone being crit hard while stuck in frost!
---
it sounds like you are not experienced enough to be a guild leader.
---
the two most important things to have before starting a guild is a competent main tank and a knowledgeable raid leader.
---
if you have these two things (it could be the same person) then you can build a guild.
---
Haha slim for sure. No comics though :/
---
Troll is actually the min/max caster race.
---
I was already 100% invested in The Horde, but this was even more affirmation that Horde is superior.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
They dont want to tank or heal. Can only say my experience with pservers, but man it was terrible. Warriors trying to dps low level dungeons when the only dps ability they have is heroic strike, that generates high threat. Classic should be better because the low level dungeons are much easier than pservers based what we have seen on beta, so maybe more will be willing to tank. Every shaman wants to dps as well.
---
This was fun to do in diablo 2. Go to a trading game and try to offer amazing items for a mediocre one. Have friend with the mediocre item in the same game open trade with them.
---
When they overpay for the mediocre item and come back to trade for better ones, just say "sorry sold"
---
This is where I first learned about ethics and to disregard them for videogame wealth
---
Huh?
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Layering
---
True, but SoR gives you increased dps over auto attack as well, roughly as much more damage, and scales with spell power where SotC is always a flat value. I guess SotC scales better with melee crit, but synergistically it just looks like SotC was meant to be the "proc seal."
---
Man you only get paid for 8?! That's rough :/ and I agree completely!
---
I'm going to world PvP! I started out on my dad's small PvE server so I never experienced anything besides long BG queues. I'm also starting as horde. My only horde character is a boosted monk for WoD so I can't wait to check out how the other side lives.
---
Got a good laugh at the questions, man. Good stuff.
---
Yeah, the Hallow's End event existed in Vanilla but the Headless Horseman wasn't added until TBC.
---
Hahah it's to boost your points abit and give you insight in how the quiz is build ;). Shaman's can tank dungeons ;p
---
Salt?
---
for classic you just have to do it right before mob dies, slightly worse but still doable
---
Said I should be Priest/Shaman. I mained a Shaman in Vanilla and had a lvl 60 alt Priest. Well played.
---
They recently forced most of their senior staff who have been around for a long time out of the company, I doubt there are more than a handful of devs who worked on the original that are working on classic now. Maybe none at all. I remember for Starcraft Remastered, the only guy who worked on both the original and RM was one artist.
---
Yeah, playing with a lot of RL friends as well, but I love the horde regardless :p though classic alliance was very fun.
---
SoR is not proccing most of the stuff so its in a weird state.
---
Did you eat paint chips as a kid?
---
Warlock sets. Even starting with the blue dungeon set and through all tier sets their stuff looks great. 
---
Tier 2 Warlock Nemesis is my favorite but the other Warlock sets aren’t far behind.
---
Ya spirit of aquamentas was sick before they changed it. we won’t see these in original form unfortunately.
---
It's too early for this!
---
so 30 then or 35 for spirit tap. Choose your own adventure. I just know that the reduction talent for cast time for smite/holy fire is really strong in holy and can allow them to do respectable damage.
---
Dude that's tight lol. My drive is only about 20 minutes, but it takes me a minute to get up at 3:30am lol
---
They are strong in different ways. Sometimes the orc racial won't proc and a war stomp can save you
---
Yeah, be the biggest dick possible and you'll get tons of raid invites! (Haha check your first sentence) ;)
---
Haha all good things come in time
---
Yeah I don't know what the Vanilla Main LvL60 Stats are.. But Warrior are indeed one of the highest populated classes. However most of these Warriors will never even come close to their potential, so if they want to get more out of there gameplay. Another Class could have helped them. At the end of the day, you pick yourself and the outcome will not bind you in any way.
---
If you look closely at troll fingers they are pretty wide allowing to a more stable surface to hold the cake.
---
Thanks man :)
---
Brave words for someone wearing robes on a fight
---
Oh damn. What do you do if you dont mind me asking
---
Lold
---
Not sure if buying cobalt at whatever price it's going for and then turning that into more money is considered a scam...
---
Anyway, an actual scam that was always obnoxious as a hunter was the one where people would list single thorium arrows on the AH for the same price as the stack of 200. Some people would buy them without noticing. That's a massive profit percentage.
---
Biggest AH scam is knowing when to invest and when to sell. We know what each phase will be, what consumes go along with that. Never buyout, only bid.
---
Lol getting T2 just to run UBRS is silly. You can tank any non-raid content at the relevant gear level.
---
A legendary weapon. Before you say that's never going to happen - shutup. Secondly I didn't put a time line on it. If classic is a stand a lone game for a while then it should be possible to get things even a 2 years after release.
---
Tier 3 Rogue, Tier 3 Warlock, Tier 0.5 Hunter
---
I wear my dress with pride!
---
Hahah damn son! Thanks, thanks for taking the quiz
---
That helm just completes changes the way you feel playing your character!
---
There is going to be millions of tanks on retail wow, this is not pserver when the population is limited.
---
You charge, reserve items, people will hate you...
---
I used to buy out some rarer niche items then repost them for about 6x the cost I bought at.  This method has done me very well.  I do a few other little tricks to ensure new competition is closer to where I posted my price, but it's been pretty flawless on mid-sized servers.
---
Ah, good ol' blizzard and their shoulder pieces.
---
Here's the thing. Yes, it can work. As far as how it holds up for healing in raids, you're gonna get an array of answers from people who have done it who say yes, and then...not really. Pallies have awesome mana efficiency w/ FoL and the mana refund depends on crits which if you look at Divine Favor and Holy Power, I think they speak for themselves even if you can live without BoK and Imp BoW.  It depends how effective of a healer you really want to be. If you go into a raid as a hybrid that CAN heal w/o heal spec, other hybrids who would rather be shadow/feral/boomkin/ret/prot might cause you drama too, or your RL/GL. You'll have to feel it out. Either way, have fun!
---
You think you have a quest to turn in, but you don't. You'll see.
---
There was a fix in 1.10 that stopped SnD from playing the animation if you used it on a dead target.  Could that be what we're remembering?  I don't see anything in the patch notes regarding combo points on dead mobs.
---
Remember me when I break the world record of gender specific speedleveling!
---
Hey, that is a good idea.
---
Orc is definitely better for pvp my friend!

I feel like Holy Shock is very much so needed. Both in terms of 1v1 PvP damage and raid healing. So Holy Power and Holy shock are a must. I'd remove Vengeance and a point from Retribution Aura. That might just be me though.
---
I mean. Most dps UI I've seen the meter is a large chunk of their screen so even if they don't admit it dps cares about meters.
---
I doubt it. I don't think they want to allocate a bunch of server capacity to Classic.
---
Actually play WoW this time around instead of thinking that it's stupid to pay per month to play a game while being a giant hypocrit that pays for xbox live (I spent the glory days of vanilla WoW playing Halo 2).
---
Its garbage, dont bother. This is probably rigged. 
---
Priest
---
Shaman
---
Ya those two are not even on my radar.  Nice try though/s
---
I private tutor English online to business clients in Asia! It is kind of a niche market and my language skills kind of help. I  lived there for 5-6 years so got a pretty solid network
---
Ret pallies are pretty bad at pvp outside of a 1v1 fight. 
---
they are at their best when they are in the back healing the rest of the team.  give your team mates bof, bops, cleanses (lots of cleanses)
---
I believe it did work that way. People just weren't clever enough to figure it out back then.
---
That could but they wont, plus the majority of the playerbase dont want it also.  
---
I played a wl to 60 onpserver just to realize i dont like the class in pve because of the debuff limit.
---
So i rerolled to a warri.
---
But you can stomp very hard in pvp with your dots.
---
I'm undecided between gnome/orc warlock
---
Visually, I much prefer orcs. Gnomes are too tiny and you can't see their gear too well
---
And Orcs have they have the +25% stun resist which is amazing in PvP
---
But I played horde pretty much every character. A gnome can be a new experience for once
---
And gnomes don't have to deal with paladins (cleanse), they get -30% threat reduction in PvE (Blessing of protection) and it's probably easier to gear up because less competition
---
I can't decide!
---
2004: OG WoW

2019: Vanilla or Classic

All that stuff makes me feel like I am taking crazy pills. My guild killed KT, and we were a pretty competitive guild throughout. We pretty regularly brought 5 hunters to our raid, including me. We were incredibly competitive on DPS, topping on some fights.

Got Priest/Shaman

I will be neither,  going for Mage main and Rogue alt

[Here](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=36282&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=58151) is a Patchwerk log including a spelladin DPS, where it's clearly competitive. And before you sperg out, yes it's a private server and numbers are subject to change. But the majority of the build has been confirmed to work in the beta already so we'll just have to see how it works on live.

Since you are alliance it shouldn't be as bad.  Horde warriors are mostly 2-handed due to windfury but for PvE dps going 1hand fury is usually better for alliance (from what I hear).  If that is the case Ashkandi would be a PvP item and pally would be just as valid as warrior for rolling for a PvP weapon.  But yeah raiding as ret would be harder than raiding as holy and bidding on it as a PvP weapon IMO, depends on the guild.
---
For raids. For PvP and solo it's all plate all day.
---
I have to imagine it'll be delayed til phase2.  It certainly should be, since the primary drop for the blue dragon sinew was azuregos.
---
You are correct.
---
Never claimed to be an expert. In fact I clarified twice that I'm only going off my own anecdotal evidence from vanilla and Tank streams/content videos.
---
I'm just saying that some people will suck at tanking and will spec Prot to make up for their lack of skill.
---
So not ANY Warrior will tank in ANY spec. Some Warriors will suck and go Prot for the safety net.
---
It’s not viable.  Maybe you can offtank in AQ40 if you have a nice guild and you’ve been pulling good dps in cat and have BiS.  No point in using a feral tank really ever tho.
---
The flaker the class leader the better.
---
I just want to know where i am in terms of loot and someone to tell peeps to be enchanted and have consumes.
---
There shouldnt have to be someone that babies us.
---
Will Bloodvine even be in the game? ZG is listed as part of phase 4.
---
No, that’s why I don’t roleplay.
---
I've learned not to expect things in games. More often than not I'm just disappointed. I hope they do us well but you just never know anymore.
---
warrior or feral druids are the only tanks you will see raiding end game.
---
all of the pallies will be healers
---
Give it 6 months after wc3 remastered, I'm sure someone will release an amazing unofficial wc4
---
It was very interesting to learn about your views on what professions to get. I have always wanted to do enchanting for the same reason, but I normally stick to mining + BS or mining + Eng. I don;t know if I want to do any PvP but enchanting is useful for that too.
---
Feel free to take a look at my lengthy post on this thread too, I think we have some similar feeling on this beautiful class :3
---
This. People keep acting like the primary issue is the zerg rush beginning. No. It's the fact that 75% of players trying it out could easily burn out and leave ghost town servers.
---
Star-Lord, man ! Legendary outlaw ?
---
Having a friend like this, I will roll an Alliance just to piss him off. That will be a good reason enough by itself.
---
life has many portals, Ed-boy
---
I don't remember this being a thing in vanilla. Combo points were lost on the target dying or you switching targets. Eventually I want to say in WotLK but possibly sooner, they added the ability to cast left over combo points on a killed target on either slice n dice or recuperate, but you couldn't carry those points to a new target.
---
But I'm going off memory alone here.
---
Really? Go tell that to the majority of people who have played Ret Paladins and have been constantly rejected for min max raids. Ret dps is right at the bottom of the barrel they have no sustained damage.
---
I think you might be right. I'm gonna swap Mage/Pala with Priest SHaman
---
I didn't find the quest that hard.  Took me 3-4 attempts.  Definitely want to bring a friend to wipe it though or you need to wait like 2 hours to retry it.
---
I remember this being a thing, but not until WotLK at least.
---
You will be surprised how well you handle rogues with blackout, shadowguard, instant fear, PWS, and a warrior buddy.
---
Imagine they would continue from vanilla onward into another time line, where wow keeps its spark?
---
&gt; Fear in PVP makes enemies move slowly? - [https://youtu.be/NZIg4OZlA-4?t=66](https://youtu.be/NZIg4OZlA-4?t=66) 
---
im not sure what you mean, the feared target runs away like a maniac at 1:18
---
I remember being able to do it, but only once recuperate was thrown into the mix, so I'm talking WotLK.
---
scum.
---
I won’t tell them if you won’t.
---
Open Raid was leagues better than what we got.  Shame the community abandoned it.
---
What happens if there's sharding in starting zones? Would pop stay too high?
---
Yea, no way 14 years of compound interest is coming out at 800g
---
How great would that be, though, if they could release a new wave of those "What's your game" ads for Classic? Like, just spitballing here, imagine one with Mark Hamill as a Gnome Rogue pulling a Joker/Chucky bit.
---
And of course, it'd be great to see something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc) again.
---
Arcane Shot and Aimed Shot most definitely shared cooldown during vanilla.
---
I appreciate the link and although that seems a bit encouraging, I wouldn’t doubt that the lowest dps above the paladin are either undergeared or just bad.
---
Nax was osrs
---
Clearing Naxx. Only got 3 bosses down before BC hit.
---
is that Payo in the top pic?
---
No you will confuse most people saying vanilla
---
Layering is dogshit
---
Yep. I must be thinking of when Steady Shot came into play or something, and weaving in Arcane perhaps since it started to finally scale with AP.
---
Vanilla
---
Are MCP’s mandatory for feral dps?
---
I'd go dwarf because dwarves are better than humans. Their jokes are better, their voices are better, and who doesn't love dwarves?
---
Treasure finding and stoneform are also good.
---
STV has such a special place in my heart. I leveled there as a Hunter in classic and got murdered by rogues, druids, and shamans all day. That deadzone was just awful if people knew how to abuse it. Absolutely hated the place and would log out for long periods at a time after being ganked repeatedly hoping they would go away. 
---
Got better at the game after hitting 60 and leveled a Rogue as an alt and experienced the other side of the coin and had a blast. I always thought that these dudes we're just winning because they had stealth. After a few failed attempts on my rogue, especially vs casters, I realized I was wrong. Turns out there is so much meticulous planning and a ton of patience that goes into a full HP gank as a rogue that I didn't realize. Of course if you are at 20% HP and get ganked, hardly any thought went into that. Stalking someone for a while and waiting for a moment of opportunity to strike is super fun though.
---
Really? That is weird as I saw feral druid tanks fairly demanded in TBC, at least on my server. Our Druid main tanked fair bit of bosses and they were definitely strong especially at the start of the expansion where they got all that armor gear and scaled amazingly with it. In wotlk all tanks were made closer to each other i suppose. 
---
I suppose the stigma is always annoying but it definitely wasn't as bad as You claim it to be, at least on the server i played on.
---
A lot of the raid gear was amazing but my favorite set that was obtainable by more casual players is Darkmantle, the 0.5 rogue set. 
---
I got my set back in classic as a casual scrub newbie. Completing that set while it was still current is still one of my prouder achievements. I still have it on my rogue too, I played on a RP server and she wore that set to every RP event for the next six years.
---
Who? Who will be confused by that?
---
There will be a huge initial rush and then populations decline. So the solution: have more players per server and layer the servers so you have blizzlike concurrent population cap per layer. Now, when those people quit, you turn off layering and you still have  a realm that has a reasonable amount of players.
---
Naxx was WotLK
---
Right there with ya! Never had one in vanilla but I plan to roll a sweet looking female troll priest alt this time around!
---
When WoW was Fortnite.
---
like millions of other EU people
---
You can't really kite if the spam it on cd with the talent that is true but many dont have that talent. Still, so you use freedom, charge in and pray you get lucky w your dmg. If you dont, youre fcked.
---
99% of the community as vanilla refers to 2004-2006 version of WoW. 
---
Look at this thread. 
---
Noone says OG wow. Noone.
---
I got druid, warlock,
---
Same, except Holy Paladin.
---
the idea is that by the end of 2 months the majority of players quit which also happens to leave exactly the perfect amount of players for a healthy realm population that will stick around forever.
---
and if that happens to fail, which it won't because blizzard said so, the backup plan is that after 2 months now it's acceptable to force a 10h queue on people and ask them to pretty please with a cherry on top transfer to dead realms
---
I respectfully disagree. There have been many cases of the lore being shunted in favor of expansion narrative direction.
---
BOO, fear the all mighty cow .
---
Classic Lite'tm is the zero calories version
---
Selling  single arrows one by one for the same price as a stack of them cost.
---
Picked mostly DPS answers and got Paladin, so...
---
What I do know for sure, is that Classic WoW designers UNDERSTOOD that class balance is a chimera. It cannot be done. And they opted for a BALANCE between CLASS and GAME ENVIRONMENT. Which was proven to be exceptionally good.
---
Whatever class you pick, it shines in some part of the game, does moderately good in others, and sucks in other parts of the game. 
---
The problem with players and game designers today is that SPECIALIZATION comes before class and it is valued only by looking at the END GAME PvE. This is stupidly bad game design. In Classic, ALL CLASSES ARE OPTIMAL. All of them. However, not all SPECIALIZATIONS are optimal...but they are still viable to an extent big enough not to discourage players to play the game.
---
People need to realize that choosing a CLASS in Classic WoW must be done with FULLY understanding that you have 3 specs...and only ONE of them will be good at ONE part of the game. The other 2 will not be as good...but they will be good at OTHER parts of the game.
---
Classic WoW game play is NOT about end game PvE and it will NEVER be. There are 13 years of expansion of retail WoW, and Blizzard tried EVERYTHING to balance the classes : giving Shamans to Alliance and Paladins to Horde, buffing Paladins and Druids for tanking, adding Death Knights, adding more talent points, nerfing some specs and buffing others, adding Monks, adding more races, removing racials, adding Demon Hunters, nerfing and pruning classes again, adding Artifact Weapons and Power, Adding Azerite....basically, they tried every option...and the classes are more imbalanced than ever.
---
MMORPGs are good only if the is CLASS IDENTITY. And Classic WoW have that class identity. 
---
It doesn't matter what CLASS you choose to play in Classic...as long as you fully understand that you cannot be good at everything. Just like in real life. You cannot be a good neurosurgeon and in the same time be a good plumber or electrician. I want a neurosurgeon to save my life...not a plumber. And I want a plumber to fix the pipes...not a neurosurgeon.
---
For Classic, I want a Warrior to be the Main Tank, not a Priest. I want Warlocks to Soulstone, apply DoTs and summon people...and not healing. I want Druids in raids, for HoTs, combat rez and healing...not to do damage. There are plenty of Rogues and Mages for that.
---
I want Arms Warriors in PvP...not Fury Warriors.
---
And so on, and so on.
---
There are no PROBLEMS with CLASSES in Classic WoW. But there is a PROBLEM with people that are stubborn in using a CLASS for something that was NOT INTENDED to do. 
---
If you want to be a Boomking, that is fine. But if you want to be a Boomkin in raids...well, that is not fine, because Balance Druids are NOT designed for raid DPS. As I said, if I want a DPS in raids, Boomkin will be the last option. 
---
But if I want a solid burst DPS in PvP...yeah, I would LOVE to have a Boomkin.
---
So, no matter what people want to play in Classic, it's all good, as long as they UNDERSTAND the LIMITATIONS of that class.
---
What is the deal about TBC? Is that really a thing? So let’s get this straight. They are gonna just re-roll WoW all together?
---
That is hilarious.
---
honestly in vanilla. i really only got to 40s/50s. spent so much time just world pvping and exploring.
---
private servers i did everything i really wanted. raided MC/ZG/AQ20 a lot. and did BWL a few times. got exhaulted with WSG and AV. got rank 11 PVP.
---
still havent decided how im going to go at it now that im a lot older. probably just play when i can and enjoy whatever content i go through
---
I can hear that last panel. God I love that show
---
One thing I've noticed is all the cloth turn in dudes have really weird names. 
---
Ralston Farnsley?
---
Rumstag Proudstrider?
---
Not play a melee hunter that had a lot of spirit items "for the regen." I was young and really had no idea what I was doing.
---
*Joking*
---
1. Players accumulate dkp for attendance, boss kills, and donations(sometimes)
---
2. Players save up all their dkp for a few select items such as Azersong Mageblade and ignore all other upgrades which are either melted or go to the guy spending 1dkp on every other item until he is ultimately the most geared dps in the raid and quits for a guild with better progression. 
---
3. The player that left is replaced by a guy who feels as if he will never catch up to dkp and therefore has inconsistent attendance at best. 
---
4. In the event that drops have been consistent and players are spending/earning dkp properly, one super rare item remains that all warriors want. The warrior with the most dkp needs to take a short break from wow but will return. All the other warriors complain that he shouldn't get the item because he's leaving the raid even tho he has the most dkp, is consistent, and its the last item from MC he needs. If the warrior gets the item loot drama runs deep, cliques form and people quit. If he does not get the item, what is the purpose of a point system that rewards time and consistency. 
---
5. To stop this from happening again, the guild leader decides loot council will be in place starting with BWL. 
---
6. Half the raid leaves because they don't trust the guild leader and class leaders to be righteous with loot.
---
How? Why don't you just drain soul on the mobs you kill in Scholomance? 10 shards should be more than enough for a dungeon like that.
---
For raids I always had 40 shards prepared, by the time we were doing AQ I was running into a some bag space issues (having to carry consumes, Nature resist set, Shadow resist set ....)
---
Ten Storms &amp; Judgment
---
That's how I've always referred to it.  Vanilla was a completely different game than Classic will be.
---
So many who will be thinking the same...
---
Gosh the new name of huntards are gonna be huntdads isn't it..
---
Ah oke. Ret is good in PvE and also hold a raid spot. Els maybe Mage?
---
Same :)
---
Alliance was always the underdogs after the initial launch wave in my experience.
---
Lol. Sounds pretty accurate &amp; believable tbh.
---
For a really easy time making a bit of money from the AH, use an add-on (like TSM/AUX) that lets you scan for items that are listed below vendor price. It's usually not a lot, but it's easy money.
---
You can also search for items that are listed below their disenchant value, disenchant them, then relist the enchanting mats. The nice thing about listing enchanting mats is that there is no deposit, so you can keep relisting them without losing any money.
---
Conducting a business like this would land you in jail. You have to run a corporation to get away with something like that.
---
That was only the case for the first month or so after launch in my experience.
---
Alliance were relatively decent underdogs from that point forward in every server I played on.
---
Yea, a geared warrior holds aoe aggro just fine and doesnt have to drink.A dungeon farm run is already easy, rather go fast than have maybe a bit more aggro on some trash mobs
---
&gt; Ret is good in PvE and also hold a raid spot
---
Err... what?
---
Generic "no point, warrior better" answer. Not very helpful tbh.  What makes the spec not viable in your opinion?
---
Every class is useful.
---
The game isn’t difficult enough through Mc/ony/bwl/zg/aq20 to require much more than bodies (meme specs not included you get 1 spriest, feral, ret/enhance per raid—no balance elemental they can’t keep their mana). 
---
Who cares if rogues and mages do more than a hunter? The dungeon requires an avg dps of 250...if your mage does 500 and your hunter does 300...the extra 200 dps only serves to make it faster, not possible. 
---
In the end play what you want. I’d you play a lot you’ll find yourself in raids.keep showing up and not dying and you’ll probably get gear.
---
Be sure to have 1-2 soulshard bags in your bank, full of shards, for those days you don't have time to farm shards before raid.
---
"this minmaxing bullshit"
---
why is it bullshit to know how to play the game at a higher level?  it would be pretty sad if we didnt minmax a game from over a decade ago
---
Lmao.
---
Recuperate was added in Cata.
---
You have to be kind of an asshole because you will have to control a peanut gallery of 40+ people.
---
The dead pan humor is great
---
Yeah, these aren't scams, they're basic tools for any aspiring goblin.
---
Find more at /r/woweconomy :) (there's understandably not much classic comment there yet)
---
I will not spend gold on gear.
---
Why should a warrior get a weapon for pvp/farming before a paladin? If it's something that is not benefiting the raid, it's an offspec item, regardless of who takes it.
---
Telling a paladin he has to wait his turn before getting a chance at an 'offspec for everyone' item, is a good way to lose the paladin.
---
We saw 5 Ashkandi's drop in over a year of clearing BWL, 3 went to hunters, who used them for a long time. The other two both went to warriors (I was horde) who used them to PvP. None of them were highly contested items.
---
Can I have some water pls?
---
You're saying you can't add X because it causes Y, when X wasnt a direct causation. Dual speccing can easily be tuned to not allow abuse and incentivize paying gold for it. 
---
I would understand on an RP server, I wouldn't even argue removing respec from RP entirely,
---
they do not disappear when you log off.  that is only the healthstones and other summoned items.
---
get a soul shard bag and keep it full of shards.
---
I thought it was focusing on the object with the triangle, then closing one eye, and seeing if the object stayed centered. If it is centered, that eye is dominate. Then close the other eye and the object should disappear.
---
Everyone is saying sets, but I loved that people weren't always decked out in their full sets all the time. I liked the look of all the players running around in mismatched dungeon drops, items that didn't have some badass raid set theme. Just looked like regular Joe's working their way around the world.
---
and then we all start ravenously going for the arcanite bombs
---
Thought you meant deleted comment OP ^
---
I see we are now into the meme portion of the bis lists.
---
All kidding aside - these are great resources, keep up the good work!
---
Bloodvine won’t be available until phase 4 which will probably be like a year after the launch so re-leveling tailoring for it at that point would be an option.
---
Eddie should be a Goblin, tbh
---
Man, I worked real hard to get that Legionnaire title, so glad I did.
---
Typo... PvE = PvP
---
# 4.5K UPVOTES
---
# 1.9K SIGNATURES
---
# C'mon you people.
---
the majority of players will be on the pvp servers.  
---
even players who are not interested in pvp will roll on the pvp servers due to the higher population and more talented player base
---
I remember doing this in TBC. Prot pallies at some point out geared content to such a degree they weren't taking enough damage which meant they weren't getting mana back via Spiritual Attunement. Easier heroics were declared a pants-free zone.
---
You shouldn't have to worry about getting 2h weapons because nobody in raids actually uses them except hunters for stat sticks.
---
I've seen several people say that they want to buy up every good rare they can during the first month or so when they're cheap, then hold on to them for a couple of months and sell them when people start twinking.
---
If you can get enough gold early on, it seems like it would be a good way to invest it.
---
Denying someone such a rare drop just so a hunter can use it as a stat stick goes way over my head smfh
---
I’d argue Ranged DPS is a distinct role separate from Melee honestly.
---
Princess Huhuran killed our guild, I'm gettin revenge dammit
---
&gt;Human racial OP for PvP
---
I take it you meant PvE +5 skill? Or am I underrating perception? How big is the radius exactly? Sure going to be lots of undead rogues so perhaps it's better than what I thought.
---
i knew a guy who would leave 1 charge on his wizard oils and sell them on the AH.
---
Im pretty confident alliance will have much shorter que times. Most pvp players are infatuated with horde racials, even if they like alliance. There will be more alliance players overall, but id guess around 90% of horde players will be interested in pvp, and queing for bgs. Plus i think the last 10 years of horde dominance on retail will carry over to classic, unfortunately.
---
It's almost like you can barely read.
---
&gt; You can't really kite if the spam it on cd with the talent that is true but many dont have that talent.
---
That's a clear indicator, that the paladin was not specced for pvp, this is an absolute must have talent in pvp.
---
&gt; charge in and pray you get lucky w your dmg. If you dont, youre fcked.
---
Except for the facts, that ret has similar burst potential as a warrior, just less reliable and has several mechanics to mitigate the warriors dmg (bubble, heals, repentance, hammer of justice), which the warrior doesn't, he can only use intimidating shout and intercept. The ret has a lower chance to do as much burst as the warrior. But the ret can recover from taking the burst and the warrior cannot. It's the warrior, who has to hope to get lucky with his damage, not the paladin.
---
This gives me hope. Thanks!
---
I was thinking about going hotw too so I can tank and heal.  But if I go full feral to tank BRD, things would go a lot faster with the extra damage.  I guess I'll see when I hit 60 how often people need a healer vs tank, but I feel like having a full feral 60 druid tanking would be worth it even if they rolls on some healing gear.
---
That's one way to dump your stock of "How to Peel an Onion".

You talk a lot of shit for a nibba in Starshards range.
---
Start a group, set the rules,  make a healer friend, get some gear and money. You won't feel bad once you figure how much money you will be spending on respects and consumes each week.
---
Man that's awesome. I actually thought about trying to do that, but actually go to the country. Have been learning Japanese here and there and would love to someday do that.
---
you can skip the imp quest. However, the imp mana regeneration at earlier levels is absolutely insane.
---
There's your answer, so you can skip it if you have some wild n crazy buy regen mass dot plan or something. But, imp is preeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttyyy good.
---
I rolled a paladin through almost the entirety of vanilla.  I was mostly a casual PVPer and casual raider (PUGS only).  I did experience a lot of 5 man and 10 man content.  I did push the "casual" tier .5 set, which was like 5-man hardmodes culminating in 45 minute strat and I think UBRS.  I did a lot of UBRS, which was a 10-15 man raid.  It wasn't really viewed as a raid back then.  Below is my synopsis of each role vs each spec.
---
Tanking - Absolutely 100% not viable for raids.  You have poor threat generation, no burst holy damage, and NO TAUNT.  So 5 man tanking is not possible, but it's like pulling teeth.  You need raid level tanking gear for the damage mitigation for the healer's threat sake.  Even if DPS sits still and does not DPS, the healer healing you will pull aggro.  You need to be able to consecrate, use the righteousness seal to deal holy damage for 5-10 seconds without any major healing.  Losing aggro is a mess, since no taunt makes it nearly impossible to get back.  This is strictly for pre-raid level 60 dungeons, the bread and butter of PVE.  Tanking low level dungeons is half decent, but you'll notice it harder and harder as you approach level 60.
---
* No taunt
---
* No burst holy damage (poor threat)
---
* Poor threat in general
---
* DPS needs to sit still on almost every pull for 5-10 seconds
---
* Need to survive the first 5-10 seconds without healing
---
DPS - Fringe at best is more then generous.  You need the gear and perfect playstyle, basically be a top tier DPS anyway, and you will still be bottom of the meter.  No strikes, and your just auto-attacking hoping for Command procs.  For every 10,000 retribution paladins, 1 might be viable.  But if your in the hardcore bleeding edge mindset anyway, why push the ret pally in raids?  It is the most fun spec, but more for PVP.
---
Healing- Mana battery god tier healer in raids.  Probably the best healer at high end raiding.
---
\*\*Talent trees themselves\*\*
---
Prot - Useless for PVE content for the most part.  Reckoning is a fun PVP spec for a weekend.  Get NPCs in Alterac Valley to crit you 5 times, and reckoning bomb somebody.  Outside of that, no too useful.  It's the dead talent tree outside of fun reckoning bombs.  Just remember, respecs are costly in vanilla.
---
Retribution - Fun overall.  All your damage comes from Seal of Command procc'ing combined with a judgement crit.  Some weapons allow for an extra attack or enchants allow for chance on hit deal XX fire damage.  So in PVP, you enter combat with a small chance to virtually 1-shot, kind of like a windfury shaman.  Your auto attack - seal of command - command judgement, weapon proc can all trigger on the first swing.  The judgement is still a button press, but when all align, it can be a 1 shot or 80% damage chunk out of a players health.  This is a primary leveling build, but too inconsistent for raid damage.
---
Holy - Solid outside of raiding.  Great PVP healers, great raid healers.  If you get bored, can be "shockadin" which is a PVP burst damage build.  Whole thing revolves around massive holy shock builds.  In my opinion, it was always too much work compared to Ret. in PVP.  You build +magic damage through all the gear.  Almost like an off-set from healing, but still healing gear if that makes senses.  I think you tweak a few talents as well.  But at the end of the day, I don't consider the burst from Shockadin to be as good as Retribution bombs.
---
Hope that helps.  It gets expensive.  I played Holy all week for 5-mans and raid pugs, then would spec to Ret. on the PVP weekends.  If you want to tank go Warrior, or play a pure DPS class if you want to DPS.  I played a lot in vanilla, and 100% of my income when to re-speccing.  You can survive solo content as Holy, but its more agonizing.
---
It's more that it's daunting to new players considering trying the game for the first time. 60 sounds a lot easier to reach as an end goal than 120 does, all about perception and deception haha.
---
Fill your bags with items that stack to 200, easiest is bullets. Then use an addon to make 16,000+ listings of a single bullet. If this doesn't crash the AH, do it again in your alt. Eventually AH will be unusable and you can use trade chat to sell for super inflated prices.
---
Lol ok
---
I've had more luck than anyone with an active subscription but as far as I know playtime doesn't count at all.
---
This doesn't contradict anything I said?
---
Should it tho? That item screams Paladin/Shaman with the proc -&gt; heal opportunity. If there is a 2h fury warrior raiding, sure his prio. Otherwise I'd say even prio for shaman/paladin warrior.
---
I know that shamans do well against mages, not too sure though, as I played horde. Archmage for me wasnt required, I was actually mage Class Lead and didnt have it lmao.. But some guilds might require it as that mana CD is pretty big! I didnt have many problems vs anyone pvp tbh. I love the mage kit, something for every situation if you use it right. Apparantly warlocks are supposed to beat mages?? But I never really encountered a lock that was pro I guess. Sappers could be useful if you oom I guess. I never made it to BWL on the mage where you have to go through the suppression room so idk. I'm rolling e.gi on the mage tho so I can Vurtne people 😄
---
What about your ping and FPS? Low FPS and high ping vastly reduces what you're capable of.
---
Shaman or priest hmmm.
---
I plan on main tanking as warrior but priest was my second pick.
---
This post must be copy/pasted and reposted on every topic on this sub (regardless of the actual topic) for the next 60 days, until everyone understand what Classic WoW is actually about.
---
This post sums up what Classic is about : PLAYER COOPERATION first, everything else is not even secondary, it's TERTIARY, at best.
---
Haha I forgot about that Toyota commercial! Thanks for the throwback. 
---
Re-doing these would be a great marketing play. If they could do one with Keanu Reeves the internet would lose its collective mind.
---
Or bear tank, they're better in 5 man's and have nasty threat generation!
---
I always made fun of the people who said priests need to be holy and warriors prot to do their job outside of raids.
---
Spamming sunder armor and revenge isn't rocket science.
---
Wait are you seriously able to store full bags in the bank? How have I never known about this.
---
You couldn't 2h tank SM lib with the whole group being level 30 and not using CC.  This is what people were doing with no effort on classic beta when the cap was 30.
---
I mean warrior has many more ways to mitigate damage than you listed and can guarantee crits with recklessness to the point where luck is a non factor. Never mind I can rocket helm death ray you for 2-10k dmg whenever I want.
---
Many people do the ret holy build so they can pvp  and still kind of raid.
---
My guild is planning on only bringing 20-25, so we don’t spread the gear too thin. At least on the early raids. Idk if we will be able to get away with it in naxx, but MC should be a breeze
---
I only got to level 60 and went on 1 raid before my parents prevented me from playing anymore. By the time I could go back and play on my own cata was out. I'm looking forward to actually playing the game for real and seeing all the end game content I just couldn't do.
---
The elites were harder but the patch they are at made them easy.
---
I expect them to turn classic to BC, there is just not enough content to keep people happy for long period of time.
---
in 6 months I expect guilds having everything on farm status.
---
Anyone 'elitist' coming from BfA who never played vanilla will have the wind taken out of their sails when they're on their 20th corpse run before level 10.
---
CST is basically EST with the benefit of having an extra hour /s
---
I want to make fun of people for being lame enough to play on a RP server...
---
but since it will be PvP you are not as bad as the PvE server players
---
Shorter PvP quest and easier AV wins. Also closer to BRM at 60, easier Ony attune
---
As someone playing a mage on PS this made me lol
---
Consider 2h fury warrior.  With so many people after one hands, a lot will be considering using a 2h to fill in the gaps, or have less competition.  Should be pretty easy to get the gear figured out.
---
Shaman if you want to get groups more easily and prefer group play, rouge if you plan to play more by yourself. Shaman for PvE focus and Rouge for PvP focus I'd say.
---
Guild this man!
---
It's not a bug tho, it was fixed during vanilla.  
---
I don't remember what patch, but i remember me and my rogue guildies whining about it.
---
I’d look at it in terms of what helps the other 39 people in the raid. 
---
A hunter will atleast use the item in the raid, so they generally get priority in my experience. Warriors and Pallies will only equip it in PvP which doesn’t really help your guild at all.
---
I mean, perception seems pretty strong, but I gotta say I don't have experience with it, might be worse than I believe. Lots of rogues indeed! in PvE the skill weapon and overal the reputation bonus
---
Apparently they actually ban you for that one :/
---
Well NOW EVERYONE KNOWS
---
jeez ..
---
What other game has a monthly subscription of $5? Regardless of if you want to play retail as well, from what I understand the sub price has always been $15. Except before when you paid that $15 you received one game instead of 2.
---
I think your thinking about it backwards, instead of thinking that you need to subscribe to Retail in order to gain access to classic, think of it as if your subscribing to classic with an added bonus of the ability to play retail if you ever decide too... For an adult $15 per month should really not break the bank, but if saving $10 a month is a big concern of yours then maybe you pick up 1 extra hour at work every month?
---
just dont do it 4Head
---
Your 30-50g/hr assumption for RFD is ridiculous btw, since private servers nerfed BRD pickpocket bard, I would do RFD regularly and never, *ever* made that much. Even with herbalism, no idea where you're pulling those numbers from.
---
That's not entirely true. Sotc is more dps than sor when your weapon base speed is over 3.5 (I think, it's been a while, could be when under...).
---
Do it, best decision of my life. Met my fiance in South Korea too. Will be moving back in about 3-4 years. 
---
If you learn the language and have some solid work experience/skills you will cruise to a sweet job in Japan. Huge labor shortage over there. Only issue is the visa! that is why I am moving back after I tie the knot. But if you are interested in teaching English you could probably land a job within a month! I started in Seoul as a English teacher. Transitioned to marketing manager and got my MBA there.
---
To each his own. 
---
If I’d be a guild master I’d be more concerned with people enjoying being in that specific guild. 
---
Nothing boosts morale more than a aimed drop.
---
I mean, if we already cleared the raid without that Ashkandi being a stat whore for our hunters, than I’d see the guild as a whole be better off with higher morale.
---
Are the other bosses doable or do they get skipped because it's too far to walk back? I think a feral druid could get to noxxion celebras easily.
---
You can't use the tailoring items if you drop tailoring.
---
Thank you for this!
---
Is it possible to have alternatives for not easily obtainable items? (e.g. Dwarven Hand Cannon)
---
This way you could possibly still have the low droprate items in there.
---
Yeah 1 q could have made the difference. I put the full scale in the post.
---
Literally nobody is going to die 20 times before level 10
---
I learnt something today.
---
I don't know if it has changed, but there's specific allowance in the ToS for a child playing on their parent's account.
---
I saw a lot of people saying that you're worrying about nothing. However, I played WOW from beta to Cata, and I very distinctly remember this in Vanilla. Entire zones would be 'owned' by the twinked out NE rogue just griefing away. Also, I can answer about the shamans: Frost Shock Troll Shamans were so OP it was ridiculous (in PVP). I'm not sure if we will be able to duel spec in classic because I've not payed that much attention, but if so, expect to see tons of shamans on horde.   
---
It's a very legitimate concern and I expect to see rapid changes in the first 3 months of release else their player base is going to take a massive hit.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0f3aCoPx84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0f3aCoPx84)  2006, 2h tank with minimal cc steamrolling SM. They took barely any damage and the cc wasn't necessitated at all here.
---
It just depends on the size and distance of the object that you were looking at. Whichever eye didn't experience a change in the position of the object is the dominant eye.
---
you wrote down 20/0/31, but the spec you linked is 21/0/30. 21/0/30 tends to be popular, but I always found it a very awkward build, you get the worst parts of a 31/0/20 and 20/0/31 build and cut the best stuff.
---
The 21/0/30 is a hybrid build with Divine Favor and without Repentence, youre abilities are slanted towards both healing and DPS. For PvE, nearly the entire Ret tree is wasted points, Divine Favor is ok but not necessary. In PvP, Divine Favor is an extremely marginal ability without Holy Shock and without Repentence or burst from Reckoning, youll find your fights slow and difficult to finish people.
---
In terms of what youre missing for a pure PvE build, the 5% crit is a big one, but not game breaking, though its still a lot better than DF. Ret/Holy is a hybrid healing spec, the main reason youre dumping those last 20 points into Ret is to get Repentence, if youre going that deep into Ret, you need to get Repentence. It helps enormously in group fights, against healers and casters and as a root. Divine Favor gives you 1 crit heal every 2 mins without Holy Shock.
---
20/0/31 is the hybrid PvP spec for Paladins. You should be trying to heal as much as possible, but you can handle a bit of DPS and fight as well.
---
If for some reason you really want Divine Favor, you should go 31/0/20 or 25/26/0, but those are slanted more towards healing.
---
The two go hand in hand. To combat some players leaving and all players playing fewer hours per day after the first month(?), they want to add 2, 3, 5 times the number of people to each realm. That would cause huge issues at the starting zones.
---
feel the room...
---
40 man raids. I started in BC and loved BC, but I always longed for a bigger raid...
---
I wanna go pve, bit literally all my friends want to go pvp. :(
---
You May be right. I’m running off of very old memories haha.
---
Warriors are very strong in pve at end game. Yet they level the slowest, have no access to unique farming areas, have little to no utility, have the most expensive repairs etc.
---
I played the stress test, and was chain pulling mobs as a warrior and probably only died like 2-3 times between lvl's 1-10(I'm a filthy casual). I think its just we all sucked back then. That is why i say today's classic will be a mix of what was the culture back then with today's current wow culture. My thoughts on the elitist was more towards lvl cap content.
---
r/healsluts (NSFW)
---
I believe that Warrior tanks also love fire shield, as the fire damage counts towards their threat.
---
I used to say sorry mates but I didn't have time to farm shards my daughter was sick. Still got invinted to raid and I would have the other locks summon.
---
For serious? I never even considered this high enough quality for a service.
---
Not level a Paladin and want to stab my eyes out with a fork. Probably go Priest/Shaman this time around.
---
The cities are just way better. That's why I'm going alliance. Also their towns/areas are mess dull looking
---
Neither of them stay perfectly still for me though. Both shift slightly to the side, though the right does so slightly less.
---
If you don't want to do it then don't, really simple.
---
Ding 60 in 7 days... Not 7 days played.  7 days after launch
---
Prot paladins use a fist weapon? That cant be right I dont even think they can equip it. Did you talk to any of the diehard people for these uncommon specs or just select what kinda had the right stats?
---
This is viable on horde side but don't bother on alliance just saying
---
I confirm you're clueless. Don't go hunter on classic.
---
He totally is.
---
Exactly! Not sure why so many people are begging for TBC to come back. TBC was the beginning of the end for WoW
---
Yes I heard this also
---
What do you *want* to play? That's the most important thing. Which class is where in the damage meter or how many other people are playing the class don't matter if you're not having fun with it. I'm going hunter because that's what I enjoy. I know it's likely I won't be at the top of the dps meters and there will probably be lots of other hunters but that's ok, I'll have fun with it anyways.
---
I played dark age of camelot with Robin Williams. He didn't have much time then but was always awesome to have him around.
---
Lock and warrior are both gods of the game. You just have to stick with them long enough to get the gear; which is the hard part. Probably wont be a dominant force in pvp until like bwl.  You do good enough dps while only using shadowbolt. So that should indicate how strong locks are when you can use your entire toolkit.
---
But if you like be a bad-ass wizard that annihilates people while draining their life force and controlling them with demons and fear; lock is for you.
---
If you prefer melee, obviously warrior then. Also can tank to get all the dungeon gear you need without competition.
---
Brave words for someone in Ambush distance
---
Everybody can play the game how they want. If you want to roleplay as a furry oomkin in goldshire, go for it dude.
---
PFFFFF holy/prot is the best for pvp.  load up on HP, spell damage + healing, and mana.  throw out tons of heals and cleanses, then every now and then turn on SoR and drop a reck bomb for instant 2k of damage
---
ret is basically pretending you're a warrior that permanently runs out of rage after 15 seconds, and it's near useless at healing.  think about it, a paladin's strength is being a durable healer that can defend it's allies, so why eliminate most of that by being a slightly glass cannon warrior?
---
people really underestimate hybrids in vanilla imo.  druid with 1/29/21 build is so fucking good for example.  use cat bleeds, moonfire, insect swarm and you've done half of someone's hp with just your opener - with no dps items.  AND you've used all 3 aspects of your class
---
The Mandella Vanilla effect.
---
I agree it seems like a waste, but just curious.... is that because of Windfury totem?
---
Get ready to constantly arbitrate petty disputes if the guild is large.
---
4 quests for each race of your respective factions.
---
60x linen cloth
---
60x wool cloth
---
60x mageweave
---
60x runecloth
---
Each gives more and more exp afaik, and also do not become available until certain levels ( at least for silk and runecloth, it's quite a bit later in the leveling process)
---
These quests grant some exp and some rep iirc
---
True fax
---
Ah that's odd, I'm no optometrist though, just know the test from when I learned how to shoot.
---
They should have you kill an npc that is giving the pitch for TBC in a blizzard meeting.
---
Died once thru 15 on the stress test because I wasn't paying attention 1v1 with a mob (after chain pulling for like 30 minutes).
---
Yeah, it's almost like Blizzard wanted them to be good at endgame to make up for the horrible grind they have to get to 60 and to get geared right after.
---
All that being said, there are some nasty Feral druid tanks that would dispute the idea that warriors are the only real endgame tank class.
---
[https://youtu.be/oyWQlXtkuJ0](https://youtu.be/oyWQlXtkuJ0)
---
Indeed. P2 Paladin Prot, Claw of Eskhandar is incorrect. Paladins cannot train fist weapons.
---
They can all meet up instantly if you want to, it's just a matter of running there and dealing with a lack of class trainers.
---
This sounds like something an alliance player would do
---
1st Naxx was in vanilla ;)
---
From what I’ve seen on this sub, there will be equally as much anti-retail elitism. That will probably translate into push back against anyone min-maxing or trying to push content at a quick pace.
---
Not throwing shade at you, but mainly the comment above, which is clearly it’s own form of elitism (thinking that anyone who played only/primarily in vanilla is better than people who plays retail). The fact is vanilla wasn’t really that hard, just new and time consuming. And I don’t mean that in a bad way at all, I loved the whole experience.
---
screw that dude, just wait to see them on classic.  I'm in the same boat as you, I much prefer NE druid to tauren, but must of my friends prefer horde - I'll basically roll on 2 servers and decide around lvl 20/30 which to focus on.
---
Nah just have babies whats the worst that can happen
---
as long as you dont go full holy it can be fine to lvl with 
---
just make sure to have spirit tap and wand spec
---
I'm going to start calling Classic "Vanilla with sprinkles". Who's with me?
---
In this situation the next best thing you can do is be a Rogue/Druid so you can stealth and avoid it when you are on your own.
---
Honestly what we need to see is how difficult the level 60 dungeons are. That is what will matter end game. Im not super concerned with how hard elites hit in lower level instances. I would prefer it be difficult though.
---
That's how it worked in vanilla aswell. People telling dwarf is superior in pvp are all clueless. How can a 3 mins situational CD be better than a 10 sec CD spell useful versus any classes at anytime. Beside NE get 9 more agi = 1.5 dps.
---
I will go something like this :
---
Looks like a super hero based on a corporate office. Water Cooler Man.
---
He would be the highest level raid boss because TBC and Vanilla are trade-offs without a clear victor in my mind lol
---
I would say that I used my right eye when aiming more than my left, but I'm also right handed so when I shoot it just is natural for me to hold it on that side.
---
By giving up one of your bank bag slots. You can't just have a full bag using 1 slot in your bank.
---
I almost did this the first time. Although I got my warrior to max and did some raiding. This is my last shot to do it right so I'll hunker down and get one up then on down time work on an alt.
---
Shouldn’t be an issue, tons of people rotate to westfall at 10 (or whenever they finish teldrassil).
---
Don't know about the howto for warlock personally, only know that its possible. Something to do with enslaving demons
---
Avoid playing with fanatic scum?  Absolutely!
---
Also, this was one of the first things Blizzard said about sharding in Classic,
---
&gt;However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic).
---
Any other hybrid type specs you can think of that get underlooked? I was messing around with hunter talents and an intimidation/scattershot build looked pretty fun for pvp
---
Don't worry you won't be alone... going from Paladin to Priest. Love plate and big weapons but going to a whoosh wand.. going to be interesting.
---
Ret is wrong too it looks like.
---
you press as many different distinct buttons per fight as any other class, but you press 1,2,3...2,3.... instead of 1111111111222222222333333333  
---
99% of the button presses on other classes are just spamming while you wait for gcd/spell casting to end.  pala is really not more or less boring you just dont repeat button presses a lot
---
If you want an excellent videos on Pros/Cons of 5 man instance leveling, check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9frydWyhL8
---
tier 2 on human male though...
---
No problem but why? Dark shore questing is better.
---
Narrator: It was not.
---
Awesome. I like to make fun of a friend who was a NE hunter. He did it at level 1 and then realized there's no Hunter trainers in the human zone so he needed to go all the way back to do his taming quests!
---
Ah okay nevermind. Now I'm disappointed.
---
If it's neapolitan what part of the game is the strawberry that nobody ever eats?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYSBPo_mAD0
---
You're adorable. Enjoy being a meme.
---
&gt;  but they had to do guess work to fill in the holes and got help from the biggest private server devs to do so, it was in a dev interview. 
---
Proof? A dev from that big private server said no dev from that server was working with Blizzard on this subreddit aswell.
---
Might be a chance to get some gold early if you level as you get cloth - people will want low level greens to DE for wands to level with. At minimum I’d say stockpile all the cloth you can as you level up to help minimize costs.
---
Yep if the druid of the group waits til like 12 or so they get moonglade teleport for all their class training and quests so its nbd there. But you're absolutely right trainers are the holdup in a few cases.
---
It will drain your money, but not as much as Enchanting typically does due to easier access to mats.   
---
Ranking it up as you level is possible with a little effort, and it's less impactful if you grind a couple levels on humanoid mobs here and there to stock up on cloth.
---
Naxx is out!
---
Who is this noone fellow?
---
this is bigger than folks think
---
I had a friend level holy and people were taking him to dungeons he was quite under leveled for but he could keep them alive as holy
---
They are playing late night. Couldn't find a third guy. They are taking so much time the healer is oom
---
Druid and fill any hole.
---
For me, a preBiS list is a goal. It lets me know which quests I should make sure to grab and which dungeons I should run the most.
---
I'll take any upgrades I can get, though, and my focus will be on finding good people to play with.
---
Yeah the stockpiling of the cloth absolutely makes sense, and probably is great for cutting costs
---
So if I do it early enough, the economy won't really be at a point where it can "overcharge" anyway, since everyone will have no gold at launch.
---
I'm so excited! Gonna be such a unique experience!
---
Make bags. Sell them. You will not make tons but you will not net in the negative.
---
Forget the theorycrafting part! On that character selection screen is when you gotta go full RP whether you plan on RPing or not. Because you'll always end up making someone you identify with and take pride in being, no matter which race or class it is.
---
That's how I ended up with Gaskal, whom I identified with so much that it became my username in lots of places.
---
Should be fine.  
---
After your bear form quest, you will have the 'Cure Poison' questline at 14, which I believe includes Darkshore quests, but it isn't a deal-breaker, and the aquatic form at 16, but entirely in Moonglade, so no worries about that. [If you need more info.](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quests=4.-263)
---
Yeah that’s the only potential negative is lack of class trainers.
---
full holy as in no wand spec or spirit tap??
---
Oh yeah enchanting is insane costs! 
---
I'm very excited and intrigued to see what a fresh wow economy is going to look like
---
Great guide !
---
To your knowledge, are there any solo dungeon farms as lock?
---
I like how you expertly crafted your question to not directly state your loyalties.
---
Well played!
---
I totally agree. The filthy nightelf hunters seem to disagree. Funny, the worst hunters I've ever seen have all been nightelf, coincidence?
---
I didn't click through, but is it based on farming and using a zillion of those on-use maces? I've seen that discussed before as a way to make druids more viable. Seems a little crazy to do that though, but I suppose if it works, it's just like farming anything else.
---
i love that song.
---
Ahh yes of course, the bags!
---
Good point, thank you.
---
Stoked to see a new wow economy pop up and watch it unfold!
---
Oh wow this is amazing!! Who ever made this, please consider making a full comic out it, Ed, Edd and Eddy in WoW would be pretty incredible!
---
Did you run out of fruit snacks or something?
---
Quel'Serrar
---
I wouldn’t worry about how many others are playing your class or competition for gear.  No matter what you play, you aren’t going to be unique and you will compete with half the raid for gear.
---
Warlock is life, don't fret over a silly racial that isn't that bad anyway!
---
You play with 9 less agility 1,5% dodge less and don't understand how a 10 second CD is more powerful than a 3 mins situational CD you don't even need to use to beat a rogue if your braincells are connected.
---
Anyway the reason i ask you not to roll hunter is because you praised the +gun racial. It clearly means you are clueless. So for the sake of all hunter don't roll one please i beg you. You'll be bottom tier shit dps and perpetuate the meme that hunter can't dps.
---
In all regards thx.
---
Perfect! That's a nice list. Maybe I'll stick around until 14 then. Thank you
---
Quel'Serrar.
---
It's in one of the interviews no way I can find it.
---
But I enjoy the downvotes, people who choose to be ignorant and stupid entertain me.
---
Just to be with friends:)
---
well I think hes pointing out that you said "full shadow"
---
That's why i said in parenthesis that i'm a filthy casual, cause i am, no way min/max and i plan to tank too (night elf), don't know everything and don't expect others to. Sorry if it came out that way. I'm more worried about the culture and community and do not want it to be ruined. I use to teach new players the game and i plan to do the same cause i had fun watching new players kill bosses for the first time.
---

---
When my kids started playing games, they would basically just look up at the sky and spin in circles. Thank God they're better than that now.
---
Play however you want.
---
Orc - if your playing classic for pve you're playing the wrong game.
---
thats my plan, maybe respec at 40
---
really if you get 5/0/5 you can do anything from there
---
I made a similar post some time ago and the general response was this : play what you want. Making guides is a good way for youtubers / streamers to create classic content and riding the hype before the release. It doesn't mean anything else than that really. Preparing for the game and playing it is two seperate things. It's really easy to look at numbers, but numbers isn't gameplay or "general feeling". You could be prepared, yet totally change your mind once you get to actually make your character. 
---
Plus, it's only a very small minority that will minmax or be a dick about it. True, something like shadowmeld when playing a rogue is a waste, but it's not gamebreaker in any way. You benefit much more from simply playing what you want. I think the mentality of minmaxing that much comes much more from retail and doesn't apply as much to classic. In retail where each class can do anything, switch specs with one click and have a new max level character in a few hours... It creates a different mentality. Also, nobody really communicates or has any patience in retail. A golden rule to me is that mechanics &gt; dps. Yet, in retail after a single wipe people get kicked in dps order. That should not apply as much in classic. And remember that classic dungeons are not like retail dungeons. I believe all classes succeed in dungeons and can get good loot. It's not limited to raiding.  
---
Most importantly, each class is unique and brings something to the table. Don't take anything too seriously right now and do what you want.
---
No no, your comment was fine. I meant the original response to your post.
---
Yup, remember having to fear a mob to help tank or interrupt something. And 9/10 times they would zoom like the flash into another pack of mobs before it would break.
---
I don't know if I will have the time to raid this time around. I know I can't play 8-16 hours a day. This time, I think I am just going to relax more with it. I ran a hardcore raiding guild in Vanilla. Going to run a guild again. But I plan on just finding people that want to be social, do dungeons and that is about it. If raiding happens, cool. But ya, just going to be a filthy casual this time around
---
You want to delay until lvl 16, because the aquatic form quest will send you to westfall anyways.
---
There’s a Druid trainer in stormwind. I would just leave my hearth set in tedrassil till after certain class quests are done
---
Ah yes! I can't wait to be the best balance druid on my server! Won't be hard when I am the only one 😅
---
Why would Varian be there?
---
Oh man Warcraft 4 that takes place after Classic would be amazing. BC is my favorite installation of the game but lorewise it ruined so many characters. I'd love to see how an RTS would handle it instead of an MMO. I know it won't happen because of all the time they've put into the Chronicle and such, but one can dream.
---
Play a rogue and you will always be able to choose your PVP fights.
---
People will still try and gank you, but they will usually fail once you learn the tricks to get away. then you can choose to make them pay for their choices, or just go on your merry way, leveling and harvesting and questing.
---
That is what I did in vanilla.
---
What class / race was he?
---
&gt; people who choose to be ignorant and stupid entertain me. 
---
So you want me to believe you because 'you said so'? I can link you a post of blizzard devs going back to the 1.12 client and taking values from it if you want? why can you not give me the same kind of info?
---
10 seconds cd that is unusable in 99% of situations because you can't use it in combat... Enjoy your 9 extra agility, while rogues dump on you all day.  I didn't praise the gun racial, I simply added that to the list of reasons why dwarf is superior to nightelf. There is no argument here, you're just retarded. Shadowmeld. Bahahahahahaha
---
Oh ye  i meant to say mid right for a lock. Whoops.
---
Phil from accounting
---
I watched the Beta streams and realized Classic wow is going to be  easier now for us than when we were 14 and sucked, and it appears easier in certain ways than some of the other servers I've become used to.        
---
I'm not worried about rolling feral druid or WF shaman anymore. 
---
           
---
Am I going to be viable for bleeding edge progression raiding? No, but neither is my new schedule as a working adult so who cares?
---
                 
---
In time will I probably get to see most content I want to bringing or playing a sub-optimal class? Yes. 
---
       
---
Am I going to be a versatile and adaptable party member that can fill lots of rolls while leveling and having fun? You better fucking believe it.
---
Made excel sheets with all the items needed for a profession level to cap, spammed /2 that I sell these packs. Late wotlk mats were cheap af at the AH, and the packs made me \~3/4 times of the gold invested (depending on the pack). Made the gold cap in a few days :D 
---
Tried again but this time was using TSM in MoP, ez gold again.
---
ah sry, /woosh on me lol.
---
There is a hunter trainer in the dwarven district and one in ironforge. He just couldn’t learn his class quests from them so he had to go back to tedrassil to learn it. I had to do that too. I kept my heart set there til after I learned to tame  at 10 🤷‍♀️
---
Are you sure? I thought I used this "trick" in tbc too when farming. But I might be wrong.
---
That's because blood elves tho
---
If you have fun playing the class then why does this matter? There's a reason they're overplayed
---
My mom is going to make me and the boys hot pockets
---
My thinking is that hunters are pure dps with really strong solo capability mening no respeccing from healing all the time. A decent hunter can also "save the day" by solo a mob or two after a wipe or solo the last few % on a boss with thier pet. The main reason though is the time om saving with not having to respecc as much. Also leveling will be faster. Time is my biggest factor when choosing my class tbh. Mage and rogue would also be fine choices though.
---
Enchanting got a little easier if you leveled it alongside Tailoring; plenty of greens to DE as you powerleveled through the easier Tailoring recipes. Leveled with both in Vanilla &amp; a couple private servers and it's very doable as long as you're smart about skill purchases and general money saving.
---
It is, however it can also work on alliance side. The fight needs to be relatively short and/or have adds to deal with (2h whirlwind = big dmg) for it to be competitive though.
---
yes.
---
Interesting how that works out.
---
SoR doesnt proc those consumes anymore. Spelladin dream is dead. Besides, you can't call it a "solid dps class" when there is no full raid parse with a pally competing on damage, even when they bring 60 pummelers to naxx its not enough
---
I heard prot pallys are amazing in dungeons as a tank.
---
Plus Strath and schoolo would be fun as a pally
---
Farming them isn't really an issue as explained. Sure would be nice to have the chance to generate them on drain soul tick though (don't kill me no changes crowd).
---
You're only really going to smash your stock on fights that you are learning and this need to hand out 10-15 cookies between attempts and thus not getting trash to restock.
---
I have leveled it fully twice in vanilla and tbc, along with every other prof. Tailoring isn't nearly the money sink that eng or BS (depending on how much you want to farm yourself).  There are some tough bottlenecks (wool as you mentioned... narrow/inconvenient window of mobs drop it) but not bad at all. While leveling, you might just need to stop in an area for longer to farm certain cloth. This depends on how much to want to level up tailoring as you level your character. Like most profs, if you just play naturally with no farming, you will not find enough cloth too fully level it.  Most will just bank all cloth they find, maybe level it a little as they play, and then just go back as high level to quickly farm the cloth later. Or use the tailoring as a good reason to grind more levels while farming.
---
Also, farming cloth as a mage is great imo.  Well, farming nearly anything with a mage is great, but I find cloth farming on a mage pleasant. Especially with teleport, blink, free water, and aoe.  You'll have to buy a few things from AH (e.g. leather) but not much. Also, although you should level first aid eventually, mages can survive without it better than some classes early on.
---
That big silent friendly Male Tauren druid running around doing nothing but buffing MotW/thorns and /waving everyone is probably a chick then.
---
As others have said, play the game the way you want. I have accepted that Classic will never be what Vanilla was but I'm excited to play it anyway - this time way more casual due to being an adult.
---
It did make Loatheb trivial if you used a few shadow priests as shown in the screenshot.
---
Holy crap I didn't know about him :( I loved him as a SC2 shoutcaster, would have loved to see him cover classic :(
---
Average attractive actress, her roles include talking without facial expressions. People find it funny because she is hot. Any less attractive actress couldn't pull it off.
---
Enchanting has never intrigued me tbh, I'll just snag my chants from a guildie or a chanting buddy I make
---
I plan to be engi as well, but also want alch as I plan to farm DM E a lot once it comes out for them sweet herbs
---
Many decisionaries to make
---
56 cases of SPAM and lots of laxatives. Oh and a bucket.
---
I don't care about you or your opinions.
---
&gt; I want to do tailoring for the full effect of the bloodvine set   
---
Not in the game. It is it phase 4 a year or more after Classic launches.
---
Same meals as any given workday. Two protein shakes, fried eggs &amp; cheese, plenty of yogurt, and granola/grain mixes as snacks.
---
Just wow
---
What goal are you trying to accomplish with dual spec here? I didn’t know you wanted to tune it differently than how it was originally implemented.
---
Also, explain why you think this is a good idea. Why is this convenience necessary when it, more obviously to me apparently, allowed for classes to perform several jobs on a whim? How does this promote the spirit of Vanilla, which by many accounts, was when classes had individual roles and decision had consequences?
---
I watched interview and they said no RP PVP  when asked. It had Ian.
---
Gave holy pally a whirl in WSG on an i60 server.  I was a terrible paladin but I had fun playing heals and supporting people without being terribly squishy and thought it might be a good alt (and thus my reason for now considering alliance). 
---
What does leveling as ret look like for dungeons?  Can I still heal fine with just a couple pieces of caster gear?  Do I need a full set of caster gear?  Am I not able to effectively heal 5 mans while ret?
---
Will reck still bombing work in Classic or was that something that pservers had wrong?  I just discovered it while looking into pally pvp videos and it looks like it could be a fun novelty if I tire of healing all the time.
---
I want to actually have a fair amount of gold. Back in vanilla I was ~16 years old and had no idea how to work the AH or efficiently make gold so I was always broke. I didn't get a 100% mount until near the release of TBC and that was just due to a lucky epic BoE drop that I sold.
---
Orcs
---
yes thank you ! I thought I misremembered but it seems like more people remember it that way.
---
I used that ALL THE TIME especially in dungeons because there it was kinda unpredictable when the mob dies sometimes and I could still use my combopoints for slice n dice which was so satisfying !   
---
wasting and losing combopoints is the worst as rogue..
---
Its not in the beta (tested on the last stress test)  sadly ...
---
and more sadly I don't think its reported or acknowledged as a bug :(
---
If you level engi/alchemy or gather professions you'll make bank on sales before they are maxed!
---
Nice! Thank you for the in depth response.
---
You mention the leather, would it be not a bad idea to take skinning while leveling as well?
---
I plan to go engi or alch as my 2nd Prof , could probably hold off on leveling those and try to stock up on some of the more rare, or harder to find leather
---
I know
---
But it's not opinion? I'm stating facts.
---
Steam and Twitch were both around half a decade ago when I was gaming more prominently.
---
Discord on the other had I never heard of until recently when I bought a new computer and got back into the swing of things.
---
Living under a rock in the gaming community yes, I spent the past almost decade with no gaming computer and up so far north policing that it's above the tree line. Only internet we got out there was enough for a choppy Skype call once a week.
---
You're absolutely correct, besides, no body keybounded all their spells either, most of us were clickers and some keyboard turners. The only thing thats good about classic is that there's no lfg, no flying mounts and the game's pace is considerably slower in almost evwry aspect. If you think about it, that's not impossoble to implement in retail. Not really suggesting that but my point is that this is 2019 with social media and google covering every topic imagineable and the game has been around for so long people have become so good at it.
---
I'll be rolling horde, but the one thing I'll miss is idle time in Ironforge. Best capital city the game has ever had.
---
Soylent, crockpot chicken with rice, yogurt, assorted fruits and veggies, a lot of water.
---
SoR isnt proccing shadow oil in classic. Thhe dream is dead.
---
1988 is a Boomer?
---
Hahaha yeah probably. Luckily i got a wife that understand that i cant just walk away from a raid, and I wouldnt raid if I couldnt keep the attendence requirement.
---
Im a lucky guy tbh, I get to play her games and she get to sleep in the morning and never cook food. Thats our deal :)
---
Horde enthusiast here, you got 1 right.  I live in my own condo, work in orbital analysis for satellite conjunction assessment, in good shape, still have my hair (except the grey army is winning against the brown), however you were close on the loss of ambition.   I cannot wait to submerge the last bits of it left in the waters of Azeroth until the last bubble goes 'bloop'
---
Apart from the obvious Orc/Troll - Gnome/Dwarf they can all meet up at level 1 its just how easy it is to do so.
---
From a Horde view:
---
Undead can run to Brill then Zepplin over to Durotor and run down to Orc/Troll
---
Orc/Troll can do the same but in reverse
---
Tauren have to run into Barrens and across to Durotar and again vise versa.
---
I'm sure plenty other people have done these but I worked on an Undead to Orc/Troll Starter Zone plan that you can do in 9-10minutes (depending on Zepplin times) you basically have to Graveyard hop by killing yourself in the right place.
---
its true, there are a few great quest chains but your average quest is not worth reading
---
Idk, I feel like most new players dont even know what the max level is. They will just play until they are bored, regardless of what ever X number is. Levelling in retail is beyond boring, the story sucks and gameplay is just bland.  
---
I doubt many players dropped dark souls because they were far away from level 999. Although I guess some people get pressured by friends to get to 120 asap, but everyone gets a free 110 boost so eh, idk
---
Shes a girl through ewwww
---
I do things like chicken and rice and other casseroles. They are easy to cook beforehand and heat up to eat when ready and filling. I also will cook some grilled brautwursts and Italian sausage for quick lunches and to eat with eggs in the morning.
---
No. Sure that might short term work for some people but that is absolutely one style and in my opinion not the best.
---
It doesn’t work on Beta. I’ve tried every time :(
---
Well, Blizz artist Samwise Didier had a pretty badass version of pandas in mind.

For serious, there are alot of people that wouldnt mind paying for good content, even if it is 1$ a month.
---
Actually playing the game instead of running around all over the place like the little 8 year old sperglord I was. I might not have made it passed level 30 but gah damn did Trazon the undead warrior see the sights of Azeroth lol
---
Unfortunately they are unless your guild doesn't mind you doing less dps than the tanks.
---
I always liked the sheep-&gt;pyro-&gt;pom-&gt;pyro rotation.
---
Okay
---
Back when Hurricane decks from DMF were huge I'd buy all the epic bows called Hurricane and list them for about half the deck price. People would assume I was the thing the deck being dumped for cheap. Sold an awful lot of bows.
---
Right after reading "dwarf", I read the rest of the reply in an irish accent.
---
Sounds just like a Horde player to smugly walk in, push up his glasses slowly with his middle finger, nose raised high above others, and nasally saying "well actually".
---
Kanye, "how?"
---
No, that's for feral cat dps. Bear tanks already generate enough threat, they dont generally need that added boost, although it is a great threat generator in a pinch.
---
Says the Classic elitist.
---
Alliance
---
I played a rogue and a shaman, stayed in one guild that I loved the whole time, and had a blast
---
Wrong. Its been proven not to work in the beta because SoR not proccing the same . Also, he brings 60+ pummelers to raid literally spending 20+ hours in gnomer. And he still cant compete in overall raud dmg at all. Sure a few bosses he does big dmg but overall hes still way behind everyone.
---
Having done the dps warrior back in classic, this is what sucks, pulling aggro on most fights.
---
Because its success is predicated on this shit not being in it. 
---
For example : your local burger joint decides to open a vegan sandwich shop next door. It does super well because they have a ton of hardcore vegans who hate meat.
---
Do you think upping the price of every sandwich a bit because you add bacon bits will be a good business decision?
---
I don't really get it either. I love weird quirky celebs but her whole schtick doesn't really do it for me. I find her very cringe inducing. Pretty easy on the eyes but beyond that I don't understand why people froth over her.
---
your friends should walk to darkshore instead, it is way better
---

---
Do you remote control your PC from work?
---
Two hookers, a mirror with the map of Azeroth traced out in blow, and lots of pizza rolls.
---
Not so much a scam but I would check for low price items and see if I can make extra value.
---
People often put up auctions by mistake at a low price, lower than intended. If you can snag that gg. I did this without addons, I don't know if there is an add on that will highlight any to you.
---
Check low price stuff.
---
Check for blue items, normally after it's been out for a while, if its a blue item within the upper bracket of the lvl. E.g a lvl 27 blue. And if its the only one. I would buy it and re list at 2 or 3g higher if it was the only one.
---
My first playtbrough on private servers, I'd hoard blues I find until there was none of the ah of a particular one. Then I would throw one up on ah at a higher than usual price. My biggest success was the zealot blade. Got an extra 50g on that for it was the only one on the ah it seemed.
---
Easiest scam like process I did was. Lvld a horde char, get deviate and fish and cook. Log on at a stupid time and get my friend to buy it off the neutral ah at a silly low price. Then resell on alliance for higher
---
thanks fam
---
My understanding is that any hybrid spec can do any of the roles up to like level 50/55, so you could heal as ret until then
---
Is there a history function in the AH? I could not tell you who I bought from in the AH to save my life.
---
Im more of a pve player and ill be playing warrior and engineering sounds pretty fun and helpful for tanking and just leveling in general
---
Keep set of healing gear and you can heal 5 mans leveling as ret. Reck bomb is still a thing but you cant force it by sitting unless you're spamming sit and stand to mess with spell batching which is probably an oversight that will be fixed.
---
I'll have small batch crock pot meals prepped and frozen.
---
Toss the frozen batch in the pot in the morning, have delicious food ready at noon for lunch, still hot for dinner. Rinse and repeat.
---
intimidation/scattershot is very legit as far as i know, though i dont know hunters very well
---
i think of it more as a playstyle for druids/shamans/palas than a talent spec thing, like we always had mixed talent builds like frostfire for a mage or assassination/subtlety for rogues
---
so for example you might be playing a resto shaman in pvp but you bring enough spell damage gear for your shocks and a chain lightning here and there to potentially make the difference.  It might not be min-max ultra efficient best strategy for 10v10 premades with R12-14 players... but so what?  most people aren't that
---
2004 wow is like an ice cold can of coke straight from the fridge

i am completely agreeing with you that it would ruin the game.
---
the people who actually get to make decisions dont know shit about gaming, just look at all the game breaking decisions that have been made in live over the years
---
A lot of people prepurchase games dad
---
If you look at Pingaan's Google sheet that is the source of this information he lists 2h fury options. I agree it would be nice if that transferred over to this site.
---
Of course not. But... This is Activishi\* we're talking about. And if you look on the history of their recent decisions... We can't really apply this logic here. Sadly.
---

---
portions of: beef - wild rice - green vegetables and chicken - wild rice green vegetables. freeze.
---
Reheat in a timed toaster oven, apply diff sauces, eat with water.
---
But really you could be doing 72 hour fasts, then a 500 cal low carb meal, then repeat. All while chugging 2 - 3L of water a day.
---
You could set your hearth in SW, then teleport to Moonglade and fly to Darkshore for that quest, right?
---
Uh I mean yeah Ret can be useful, and anything based on pure RNG is generally terrible. Are ret paladins capable of killing shit? sure. Are other classes and specs 50x better? Yes. I loved seeing paladins of any kind as a Warlock, mages probably love it as well. The mana pool is so small that if you force them to bubble/heal they're worthless. They were just an inferior spec in Vanilla and TBC. If you were one of those people who played a paladin but had to be a DPS then that's unfortunate. I always looked down on those people. They could have been holy and provided healing to raids/pvp. They could have been prot and provided a tank for a raid. But no, I want to play a DPS, no matter how gimping it is to my party. That's how I always saw ret. A waste of a paladin
---
GM Island is a place for game masters to reside while watching over the world. There is a cannon short story about a gnome and troll venturing to GM island to become GM's. Considering GM island is a place that exists in the world it means that both it and GMs exist in lore and therefore a 4th wall exists within the game lore. The GMs know that they aren't real and watch over the game world knowing there is a real life world watching them.
---
Thats a shitload of servers .. dividing the playerbase too much and at some point they wouldnt see the profitability in having half dead servers and eventually close them or merge them, upsetting people who have invested time in the game on those servers..
---
NA/EU numbers. Estimated at 1.5 to 2.5mill from what I gather. But then again with investor calls saying they're bleeding concurrent players in ALL Blizzard/Acti games doesn't mean anything to you right
---
They don’t have to create content for Classic and if it gets people to re-sub, that’s a huge win. That’s your monetization right there. Now if they do decide to do something like Classic+, I imagine there would either be paid DLC or micro transactions or something (I’d be down for paid DLC) but then again it could be just the subs paying for it.

I've always been so torn on this choice. But for me, human &gt; gnome for a number of reasons (after levelling both as locks) for me
---
1. Human rep gain bonus is huge for a completionist like me - also a huge time saver as some of those grinds are brutal. This will also be helpful to my guild as I can get faster recipes and what not
---
2. Gnomes get ganked - a fucking lot. Like, it was shocking how little I was ganked on my human compared to my gnome
---
3. The human levelling zones and lore are way more interesting to me personally. Yes I could just travel over and quest in them, but the RP aspect of being apart of the humans feels important as I invest in my character.
---
4. Escape artist is great but I'm more PVE oriented so I don't find myself wishing I had it all that often.
---
So, while a gnome might be slightly more beneficial to my raid group, the personal benefits vastly come out in favour of human.
---
I'm not. I started the day after release at 6am in the morning and it wasn't as bad as people say. At least not in teldrassil.
---
Thanks for the insight. Im really leaning towards lock
---
Very small gold sink, especially for a mage. You can easily farm the cloth needed, better than anyone else. But there’s not veeeery much gold in it, so I plan to drop it for something else when I’ ve crafted the Robes of the Archmage myself.

---
Idk man I see classic as a test bed for retail wows next expansion marketability. Perhaps it will go the ways of classic? Idk just a hunch, that could be a wrong hunch.
---
This seems healthier than most WOW player’s regular diets. Nice!
---
The leather you need tends to be cheap. No need to go skinning if you ask me.
---
Dual spec can just save a secondary spec. They can still make players pay to switch between them at a trainer. It wouldn't kill role identity to allow 1 free switch a week to save a redundant trip if someone needs to spec switch during a raid. Plenty of people will still pay 50g to switch back and forth over a week.  
---
At the minimum it's a way to "save" a second set of talents. I don't know how that would completely crumble the experience or lead to class homogenization.

There’s a million different websites and spreadsheets showing bis for all classes, nothing new here man

Use rank 1 always, I noticed alot of locks on pservers didn't. The only time you should use max rank drain soul is in pvp but even then it's still risky, it costs alot of Mana and you don't want to lifetap after it cause you went oom. 
---
You can gather shards during raid just use it right after shadowbolt when mob is really low hp. you can gather 20-30 shards during a raid and not hurt the dps. It doesn't always net a shard since it takes up a debuff slot and gets knocked off. Just use it when mob is really low right after ur last shadowbolt.
---
Probably night elf priest. Mainly cuz pries has unique racials that make choose race more important than other classes
---
That‘s not possible. You couldn‘t sell items with used charges at the AH.
---
I want to level 3 toons to 60 and focus on those only. Caster, melee and healer. I want to level 6 professions to 300. Cooking and fishing to 300 as well. I want to full clear all raids. Naxx included which I have done on the private server recently. I also like the unusuall challenges like learning to solo stuff that most classes cannot. I also want the grind to Field Marshall at least, not sure on GM.
---
Lifelong horde player here going Alliance and Paladin since I'm older now and have seen the light (and want to experience new content). I'll be leveling solo, so I know SoC is the first talent I should aim for. 
---
I know I'll be healing at 60 and am looking forward to it. But I'd like to tank while leveling since it's viable then (plus I'll have a priest friend to heal dungeons that should level the same speed as me). After SoC, should I got for consecration and then imp righteous fury? Or the other order?
---
After getting those two, what should I target? Thanks for the help, I hope to make Uther proud!
---
Im getting that tiger mount!
---
Aye and the ultimate proof they are doing it wrong is the fact they needed classic.
---
However the money generated tells a different story in profits. But then sub numbers tell another story so who knows lol
---
honestly blizzard is basically EA now so i expect them to try and slip in some form of monetization within the first 6 months
---
i could see them trying to put in the wow token because they cant be fucked banning gold sellers
---
to bliz management its like a win/win they greatly reduce gold farmers/account hacking and gold spam and at the same time make money.
---
to be clear if they do put in additional monetization outside something like a collectors edition that comes with the soundtrack and a pet ill be uninstalling and charging back my sub.
---
i dont mind the idea of a collectors edition with a simple pet just because vanilla had that so i consider it in line with no changes. actually super surprised there is no collectors for people to buy
---
Bummer on the /sit thing. Figured that would be the case though. Thanks
---
Have them join you, darkshore is better

Hey its Tipsout's alt account!

I’m doing troll. Shadowguard OP
---
Same! Thinking I'm going to finish Valley of Trials, head on down to Deathknell, then finish as much of Mulgore as I can. Then back to Brill followed by Razerhills and Senjin Village. I hate Senjin Village but should be high enough level to kill Zalazane.
---
Well, that worked for him, didn't it the amulet
---
What is "minmaxing" in this case?
---
Are we talking about maxing EVs and getting good IVs through breeding?
---
If so I would definitely argue that its necessary.
---
Sure, you can still win battles...in the absolute boonie low row ranks, and if you're satisfied with that fine, but a team that isn't EVd VS a team that is, is basically the equivelant of krillin VS God super Saiyan Goku, the difference is that huge.
---
I usually defer to the tank via whisper. As healer I feel overwhelming compulsion to save people, even when they are being stupid. But if the tank says 'let him die' then the idiot dies. Nearly every tank I end up in a group with feels like a long lost brother. And you always back your brothers plays.
---
Glorious
---
Hey asshole, he said all plate which I don’t think people are showing in bis lists, since paladins can wear any type of armor a bis piece of healing could be cloth in most lists. This can be useful for pvp when you wanna be a bit more tanky.
---
Aye there lies the problem I think. Boosting isn't recommended due to the confusing situation new players would find themselves in, levelling is boring up to 120 compared to vanilla. Blizzard probably feel that reducing the number to 60 'might' make it appear worthwhile taking the levelling route as it on the surface won't seem as long (even though it'll take the exact same amount of time). Can't see any real reason otherwise to bother doing it otherwise.
---
There are a lot of variables in dungeons. If your group has decent dps and cc/dungeon fundamentals you would probably be fine healing as ret in suboptimal healing gear. You may need better stats if you need to make up for other deficiencies in the group though. It is certainly worth a try.
---
Such is life when you're trying to bulk up for a WoW cosplay. Even my Warlock's character model is jacked.

The prot pally list is pretty bad overall.
---
When I was desperate for gold I would take a mundane item that didn’t have any other listings and list it for a slightly inflated price using an alt (for example, item X was worth, say, 1g and I would list it for 5g). Then, I would take a SECOND alt, and spam trade chat “WTB item X!! 10g!!” Crafty people would recognize what they THOUGHT was a potential arbitrage opportunity, and proceed to buy my item for 5g and proceed to try and sell it to the dumb, unsuspecting person that was willing to buy it for 10g (i.e., myself in disguise). The key is that it would be an item with no other listing so another person’s item wouldn’t get bought by mistake. Once I saw that my item was purchased I would simply log + rinse and repeat with another throwaway alt. Made about 100g doing this until the guilt kicked in.

3 pounds of chicken thighs
---
3 cups of rice
---
5 cups of water
---
1.5 cups of hot salsa
---
liberal amounts of my favorite fajita seasoning.
---
3 bell peppers (chopped)
---
1 medium onion (chopped)
---
Saute the veggies in a bit of olive oil til they're soft. Add rice, chicken, veggies, salsa, and water. Set instant pot to 14 minutes.
---
I usually portion this out for lunches at work, its super quick and easy, while being a decent macro spread to keep your energy up.
---
Once its done cooking, I try to shred the chicken and stir it up to distribute it evenly throughout, 1.5 cups of the mixture comes in at ~600 calories, with 25g of protein, add a piece of fruit and you got yourself a pretty well balanced meal!

As a huge fan of pallies I’m currently playing a 41 shaman on a private server, not the same at all. Shaman is still fun but completely different kind of play
---
I  can see making us pay for classic TBC. And the TCG mounts (like you mentioned).  
---
Question: Once they shift from the mounts being expensive, to the training being expensive and the mounts being (relatively) cheaper, how would this ruin the game? TCG mounts were added as early as TBC iirc, and they were just a footnote in the eyes of most people. This is vastly different to the issues of today: The in game reward mounts were just as unique and visually different as the store bought mounts. This is in stark contrast to 8.2 and previous patches.

Damn straight, fucking pussies wearing cloth make me sick.  You are destroying the class fantasy you sobs.
---
Isn’t there a Druid trainer in the park?
---
I just dont encounter like any warlocks or priests in the alliance so i barely use it. Would much rather have hex of weakness to help fuck up pallys
---
Bugs were an enormous part of Vanilla btw. They never stopped the popularity of the game. It may have hampered it, but not considerably. It may actually add to the charm of the game in some ways... weird things for people to discuss and provide some variability in experience
---
Wow, I didn't realise how close my holy priest was to bis... good memories keep coming back.
---
Oh, don't worry. You can't miss it since it will always be on your mini-map.
---
This is a real issue that rogues should push.
---
The reason it does not work in modern wow client is that a while ago they changed it so your target has combo points. In vanilla combo points were tied to your character, which is why you could stack combo on 1 mob and evis another, or slice and dice after you killed a mob before you got OOC and they started disappearing. 
---
ROGUES NEED THEIR COMBO POINTS TIED TO THEIR CHARACTER AND NOT THEIR TARGET.
---
&gt;Am I better off waiting until I'm 60 to level it or rank it up as I'm lvling?
---
There's a big bottle neck around Silk to Mageweave and yes it is a lot easier to wait until 60 to farm what you need.  However, I found leveling with tailoring to be entertaining and I loved making bags for myself and friends.  I'd recommend stopping and farming cloth when you hit bottleneck and level it as you go otherwise.
---
Did you miss the vodka and espresso part?
---
yeah PvE servers can be awkward
---
"sir the alliance has taken control of our resources!!!! what should we do??"
---
"well rude emotes of course..."
---
just feels weird lol
---
Still, throwing 18k people worth of layers in a server and hoping for the best isn’t the right solution. If the cap was even opened to 6k at launch week, the server would be a healthy pop at 3k if traffic dies by 50%. And the first 1-20, hell even 1-30, could be sharded to account for the masses being in that bracket. Just like the original plan they proposed.
---
IIRC we get the final 1.12 itemization.
---
the first few days I try to go with light proteins over rice and keep oil and butter content down. The last thing you want sitting this long is to get MORE greasy and oily. Grilled cilantro chicken and rice is a go to for me, or steak-veggie stir fry. I prep a couple per day into tupperware so I can keep focused during the first day zerg. This will be supplemented by good beer, cold brew, and dedicated sugar highs from sour ribbons. 
---
At some point my cooking obsessed GF will supplement that food with something I've never heard of in my life but is very good and allegedly healthy.  She will tell me my coffee is bad and bring "better" stuff from one of her 37 Bialettis. At this point of no sleep it will taste the same. 
---
From experience after that runs out I will break down and Grubhub cheesesteaks, pizza, soda, and chinese food and become a gross nerd goblin unfit for human interaction until the dream is over and I go back to work on the 3rd.
---
Actually focus on a main now that I know what I'm getting into.
---
I had a lot of time into level 30 alts that I didn't play again.  This time I really want to make a character that is my identity in the game.
---
I don't want to level as a prot warrior.  I apparently liked the game in slow and extra hard mode.
---
I really don't think going full feral instead of 0/30/21 does that much more DMG for taking. Although I guess your melees would love the pack buff.
---
Gross, I'd never play a mage
---
Orc Prot pre-bis suggests Axe of Deep Woods... Eh I think I'd rather go with Hedgecutter or Bone Slicing.
---
The 1.12 version and that supposedly includes the 1.11 weapons as well which is pretty mental.
---
Lol, pretty good
---
there are some pretty good spell power items you can craft while leveling up.  at end game you can make some cash off the mooncloth cooldown
---
If 75% of the population is going to quit before level 20 then why do you need any layering past that? Could they not shard the 1-20 areas and increase the inflation past 3.5k to compensate?
---
you have good friends
---
I wasn't referring to you.
---
Server / race / name / faction change and cosmetic item shop did not ruin WoW. 
---
TCG is a BC thing. 
---
You seem to have no problem paying a full subscription for reused content, but when someone runs around on a spectral tiger the game is dead for you? Okay...
---
You can run the diremaul: north run with a warlock, it takes more time but its doable, you can also kill the first boss with this. (Someone linked a video somewhere in the middle.)
---
You would have to run affliction and destruction (For Daze/Stun rain of fire etc.) with siphon life, dot them all up, and do the wall jump trick like the mages do.
---
gets better when you get trinkets and better gear.
---
Cheetos, moutain dew and stimulants i guess
---
tbh im probally going to dual box at least 2 accounts just for fun so im in no real rush, i will go fast but i expect server issues and ill have to kill double the mobs for mkst quests
---
So I plan to go ret for Pursuit of Justice, then grab my holy talents that I need to function a bit better. Then I'll finish my ret tree. I plan on using enough holy to be raid viable then rest in ret to be able to actually solo without tearing my eyes out.
---
I’m confused. I was asking who would be confused by saying ‘vanilla’, and you respond my telling me that.. 99% calls it vanilla? Okay?
---
This is called a shuffle, not a scam. There's a similar shuffle on retail involving crafting the Draenor philosopher stones en masse and then vendoring them -- if you get herbs cheap it can be mildly profitable for semi-AFK money.
---
Ah right. Taladril calls it out here, but unless you're undergeared you probably don't need the threat. 
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#rotation
---
Tell the tank not to pick it up until after the dps died. Give you enough time to get mana back and teaching the dps a lesson of patience.
---
Should have been Ron Swanson
---
Why does warlock not include fel infused leggings and snow fall boots in phase two. Phase two has Azuregos and Kazzak being released.
---
But then you'll use MC and remember why you went Priest.
---
Mom! Hotpockets!
---
Something to keep in mind, is that while leveling it will be difficult to do both tailoring and first aid. You will probably have to go out of your way to farm cloth. I think it would probably be easier to wait until 60 to level tailoring.
---
This is great. Fuck clothadins.
---
Ok let’s say all of that is true. Your memory is just not accurate. Warriors are not a dime a dozen and tanks are not easily replaced. Warriors will be much more common this time because everyone wants to be fotm but by the time we’re all 60 and you’re talking properly geared tanks that know how to play they will be sparse.
---
Citation please.
---
I'd say get them to come darkshore. There's a direct boat to the questing area. As opposed to westfall there's additional travelling.
---
Ontop of that, darkshore leads into ashenvale very nicely.
---
If your set on westfall, go at 16 for the druid aqua form
---
Shard Farming is not gonna be a problem, it's just gonna be "this is slightly annoying"
---
I dont think you get how discussion forums work. Why are you even here..
---
As a healer I agree.  
---
Normally you can let a dps die from it but hunters FD  solves this so yes kick them if it happens more then once.
---
Educate yourself: Mr. T mohawk grenade.  WoW doesn't need help to lap up the campy accolades. Please don't sully this subreddit with references to that savagely mismanaged Lego game.
---
It's nice to theorize and I love this stuff...
---
The truth that will get me down-voted into oblivion.  Blizzard won't do all this cool stuff... if they even at all do some sort of progression server into other expansions.  Essentially they want money and they would need to spend a lot of money to make the game the way it should've been.
---
Thank you for this post. this brings me fond memories of farming crap for crafting.
---
And i really do miss professions in vanilla, and can't wait for them in classic. they were REALLY important!
---
Did what I could to get warrior/tank. Ended with mage and paladin lmao.
---
Frozen pizza and diet coke. Possibly some of that Rockstar citrus killer but they only have them in stores a few times a year.
---
Yeah I definitely won't keep it past aq when I plan to go fire, but bloodvine is le pog .
---
Has blizz said for sure which phase it is in?
---
Go tell ‘em, fuckin retards!
---
That assumes MOBs live that long. If you’re keeping up on your wand progression and your rotation is tight they won’t start living long enough to take advantage of the extra ticks until mid to late 20s and possibly into your 30s
---
How do you know the time? Been looking for more detail on that...
---
Alright, sounds great! I’ll take this into account and try to figure out which trainers are where. Thanks.
---
the same i eat now?
---
why tf would this change
---
Good point thank you for bringing this up
---
Someone else just commented this too, good point!
---
Oof - idk about anything lower than 1000 calories/day for an extended period of time being healthy, especially if you're burning the candle at both ends. Despite not being physically active, your body still has a basal metabolism, and going too far below that will tire you out super quick.
---
I saw it not too long ago, I think it was phase 4.
---
I am also thinking of leveling tailoring again for it when it comes back, we will probably be fat and rich by then so it won’t be a problem!
---
Holy comment
---
While you're right in that I can't definitively say it was working like that, there are no patch notes prior to this one stating that the behaviour has been changed. I also read somewhere that /u/Theloras knew more about this behaviour. Theloras, care to chime in?
---
One of each, keep them in the stable. Switch as needed. Anything that stuns or interrupts is likely always the best option.
---
Alright, I’m assuming that every trainer can train any race, right?
---
Banana for breakfast.
---
Deli meats and cheese for lunch.
---
Steak or chicken and steamed veggies for dinner, with spaghetti interspersed.
---
Snacks included plain tortilla chips, tea, bananas, and cheese and crackers.
---
No meal or snack should take more than 10 minutes to make and can easily be consumed while playing.
---
Oof phase 4 is deep
---
Yes I meant EVs and IVs, and nature I guess aswell.  
---
Ofcourse min maxing helps, its helps a lot in wow too. If you only stack the best classes with optimal gear and talents you'll likely do better on average than using random specs.  
---
but both in pokemon and wow you can do just fine without min maxing everything  
---
I often play with NU teams in OU on showdown, just for fun, and I got to 1800 with one of them.  
---
I like min maxing, but im confident I could beat 9/10 players online with a team with totally random EVs, no problem.
---
prot pallies are bad overall
---
&gt; The prices are placement holders and just rough estimates and are by no stretch of the imagination the real values that will be on launch, economies change and bounce around, but this is about the average value, give or take some procentile in each direction.
---
I believe I made myself perfectly clear that all prices and gold gains are estimates from memory and otherwise, I never said its true, I cannot claim that it is, because I will not know until we get there.
---
Also using private servers as a norm for your argument is "Ridiculous" aswell, so there you go.
---
You make more gold in the real game, because of changed loot tables, loot chances, AH prices, and such things, its all going to change and we will find out later.
---
I wont say I know, so take it as you will.
---
Good day.
---
I don't see many possibily's for Blizzard to return to what we would like it to be. I hope we can enjoy Classic for the comming years, but any further beyond this horizon I have little faith and hope for the future.
---
Currently on a cut getting ripped for vanilla release. at the 27th a big dominos pizza, 5 double cheese burgers, fries and 2 bags of chillie cheese from McDonalds. 3 white monsters.
---
Rest of the 2 weeks back to the usual boring rice/eggs/fish/chicken etc :{
---
The scepter of celebras allows you to skip half of the dungeon. You get this from a quest when you do the dungeon. It can also be soloed with some skill.
---
A shaman or paladin healer will still roll on leather and cloth healing gear
---
2006 could be patch 1.12
---
IDK man.. heard they rip the secrets from your flesh
---
Yes, although that's mainly for threat.  It's possible you can do enough threat as bear to not need the mace.  The druid in the video I linked does recommend grinding for that mace (Manual Crowd Pummeler) but some argue that it is optional.  Either way, grinding for them is easy as a level 60 druid, especially if you are Alliance...5 minutes per run, 50% drop rate....you need 1 per boss, which you can easily get by grinding 1-3 hours a week depending on how much you are raiding.  Still too much grinding for my taste but totally in the ballpark of a hardcore raider.
---
The great part about druid tanking is that except for the mace, you are not really gear dependent.  So you have the potential to be a better tank as a fresh 60 and in MC on most fights.  It's not until post-MC that warriors really start to shine over ferals.  
---
Many if not most guilds/groups will still prefer warriors because they can't be crit/crushed when using a shield, which makes life easier on healers... but for the right groups a feral can tank almost every boss in the game.
---
#Professions Matter!
---
A poopsock may be more efficient. Allows you to wipe in one swift motion, rather than reaching for TP, and you won't have as much residual when you toss it - compared to a bucket which you might need to hose out every few hours (more time wasted)
---
60's pizza's for 30 days sound about right for me. going to mix it up of course different flavors than some from Domino's other's from New York's you name it and you can't forget frozen pizza.
---
as for drinking Water, gotta stay healthy guys!
---
Phase 4 is ZG/Green Dragons, phase 5 is AQ. Just looked it up.
---
I think he means, stat wise, Primarnia and Tapu Fini are both pretty close. But Tapu fini has a MUCH better ability, but if you want a Fae/water type, you can still do just fine with a Primarnia if you can out predict your opponent.
---
&gt;(Raiding) Fury DPS is only good in very specific raids where movement is limited
---
Please name fights where you need to move a lot.
---
[When you first get to STV on a PvP server](https://m.imgur.com/GfJNU68)
---
If you're a night elf, cats are S tier for the shadowmeld combo.
---
Otherwise you just want something with claw and good (1.4 or less) AS.
---
You can save some money by using the mooncloth cooldown to level the last levels. You learn it at 250 and becomes yellow at 290. So you could grind tailoring up to about 280 or so and then just use the cooldown to max it out before ZG arrives. That is unless you desperately want some of the 300 items like robe of the archmage.
---
hunter was alt after vanilla.  didn't play it much in wotlk and only pvped on it in cata/mop
---
WoW is an MMORPG, it has been in this genre since it's release. It isn't it's own type of special snowflake game. You play a role playing game, get over it.
---
Its easier for Horde, but yes.
---
For Horde, everybody but Undead will naturally be in the Barrens starting around level 10-12. There's a Zeppelin connecting Undercity to Orgrimmar, so Undead can easily join them.
---
For Alliance, most people tend to go to Westfall. Humans are already there, Dwarves and Gnomes can easily take the Deeprun Tram to get there, and Elves have a long, difficult journey to get there.
---
There's a boat between Auberdine (Darkshore) and Menethil Harbor (Wetlands). Once you take the boat, you run through the Wetlands (a level 30 zone) until you get to the Dwarves' area. You'll probably die several times trying to make it through.
---
Alternatively, there's a death teleport you can use where you swim out to a certain area, drown, and get sent to a graveyard in the Dwarves' area. I don't know the details on that one, though.
---
And another alternative: find a mage who can teleport you to SW or IF (this won't be available at launch, and you'll probably have a hard time affording the cost for a teleport reagent at that level), or get your friends to find a warlock willing to summon you.
---
I vehemently disagree with this. All races should be separate! Segregation and concentration camps! Exterminate all Gnomes!
---
5 hp turns into some pretty significant AOE healer threat
---
That's a beautiful typo right there. For anyone curious, 'Braut' means 'bride' in german. So basically he wants to eat bride sausage. Yummy. I hope it helps you level efficiently!
---
Should also mention that leveling a warrior is aids.
---
I can't speak for what's happening on private servers, but I was playing vanilla on day one and throughout it's entirety as a Shaman.   Back then there were definitely not one of the most played classes and I believe it was the exact opposite.
---
Hopefully some of the advantage of fury warrior stacking is offset by how long it takes to gear a raid rolling with like 12 fury warriors.. a raid with a more diversified class balance would be on average better geared, narrowing the raid dps gap between the two
---
Cant speak for myself though but a friend of mine always tries to get Broken tooth from Bad Lands, it has insane attack speed, it is a boring cat as you would say but it is the most pain in the ass for casters and you will kill anyone with it. Combined with the speed buff and stealth its an killing machine.
---
Looking up lists like these is well and good, but remember to learn why you choose certain options. Sometimes you will come across items that are good alternatives and disregard them because they are not on your little list. 
---
When looking at the prot warrior items, I noticed that all items listed are heavily in favor of the defense stat, however crit immunity is not as important in vanilla as it was held to be. Mostly due to shield block being a skill that basically makes you crit immune for its duration regardless of your defense rating.
---
Skarm has a lot of input on tank gearing on his youtube channel and I recommend anyone who is planning on playing a warrior or bearfrom druid to check it out.
---
You can meet up at level 1, but it's so much easier to meet up at 10-12.
---
See you clueless. Don't even know how to get out of combat without FD.
---
You need Mooncloth for T3 set. Not sure if you need Arcanite for the plate/mail set.
---
Gotcha. Hm. Green dragons are the world bosses right?!
---
I remember as a lil 11 year old boyo (ofc) walking into that valley in duskwood...
---
Looking at that dragon like *Pikachu face*
---
&gt; honestly blizzard is basically EA now so i expect them to try and slip in some form of monetization within the first 6 months
---
*puts on tinfoil hat* Original unarmored mount models, anyone?
---
Let them roll Warrior and then stop at 15 when they realize that every equal leveled mob is a life and death struggle.
---
Sure, im not opposed to a level squish, but if the time it takes from 1-120 stays the same and you still have to do equally as many quests it wont really help.. what they need to do is make the levelling engaging in some way. As it stands now you might aswell remove everything but 110-120, as it is 100% redundant.
---
Mom! Bathroom!!!
---
Casual guilds will let you raid. If you don’t want to be in a casual guild, then you should understand that you will have to do whatever you can to raid at a high level. Warlocks of other specs are very important to raids. Changing the debuff limit will have far reaching consequences that I’m sure no one can predict.

---
He's not on the overall list because he swaps to healing part of the way through. And yeah you're going to have to farm MCPs but that's just part of playing the class. You know that going in.
---
Looks good -- cant vouch for any of the gear lol, but it looks pretty cool. Any chance of a stat visualization in the future (eg. +200AP, +10 crit, etc)? Oh, and I did notice a small typo at the bottom its "useful" not "usefull".
---
My goodness, I did not miss this phrase! My kids used to say this constantly at breakfast in the mornings... and all the way to school in the car!
---
Actually play Vanilla. I was new to the game in BC. Though I'm excited to see the pre-cata zones again more than anything.
---
Not paying hybrid tax or rolling a class that CAN heal because you WILL heal. If I go tank/dps, it will be a warrior. If I go DPS, it will be mage/lock/hunter because...sorry, we're full on rogues, and I want to be able to farm solo.
---
Haha! First time I've seen this - awesome!
---
Swish!
---
Nothings more of a big deal than having to stare at your character. If you arent in a competitive guild, I would play the race you think looks cool
---
Blizzard includes prepurchases in with launch day figures.
---
I have seen this happen to multiple guilds I was in, first in Cata and later on in MoP. So you are almost to accurate to be joking tbh ^^
---
Your responses show that’s a lie.
---
Watch the TBC trailer video and Listen to Illidan at the end, hes got the answer.
---
that's a really bad take.  
---
you absolutely can apply this here. the customer segment that wants to play classic aren't interested in microtransactions so revenue comes from subs. they want to do as little as possible to touch that number
---
Really comes down to how well you slept the night before tbh
---
You’re right, I think they are called nightmare dragons aswell. They came back in the Emerald Nightmare in Legion.
---
Nah, it got labeled that because there were no other appropriate labels at the time. It’s it’s own genre and there are only a tiny percentage of servers on retail that are dedicated to role-playing. 98% of players do not partake in it, so you can safely say it is not a RP game.
---
&gt; possibly a temporary meat shield if your tank/healers die from some poor choices 
---
which is SUPER strong, popping defstance and press shield+1hand macro and you should be able to finish the pack. outside of that, i agree, there isnt much left than dmg
---
dont speak such rot 
---
"when WoW was as popular as fortnite is acceptable"
---
1. The DPS is so good it beats any and all utility lmao.
---
2. Your DPS is still top 3 even in MC.
---
3. by specific raids you mean all but maybe AQ where you bring a few more locks
---
4. you'll get gear
---
At 60, you can probably farm the gold to buy the ores off the AH faster than you could gather them by running around the world.
---
You win by saving time, and the lower level characters win by earning a lot more gold.
---
Mom! Boys!!!!
---
Highly skilled tanks with the appropriate gear for end game content was rare. OP is/was talking about a tank for a dungeon though. There was a vast gulf between the BiS warriors that were known by name and reputation on a server and casual warriors that are tanking BRD. 
---
Now don’t get my wrong, for example that huge room right before the throne fight in BRD with the wandering hoards of mobs was nuts when you first did it, but by and large, there were plenty of warriors out in the wild that could tank that level of content. 
---
I would argue that the biggest divide in tanks being able to do content was gear. The gear checks for dungeons was much lower and therefore more warriors had the ability/capacity to do it.
---
Gearing is a big issue.  When I rolled a warrior in Vanilla wow they were the FotM and the causal raiding guild I joined would regually bring 12-20 warriors a raid because that was distribution of guild population.  I did the math and it would have taken me close to a year just to get my T1 set. I was geared pretty well from tanking 5 mans all the time, but raiding wise it wasn't going to happen due to the sheer number of warriors.
---
2 weeks off here. And this is my whole plan in self susistenance.
---
I will be p remaking some protein, Oats and granola bars. I will also have 2 meals prepped for each day. One chicken and one beef. To mix it up.
---
I generally eat 2 meals a day along with my protein shake.
---
I will have 4 larges 2l water bottles in the fridge. Along with various beers n energy drinks. I have some good quality coffee ready and that I'm holding onto, my house mate will never know!
---
My meals will be heavy carb, heavy meat and heavy veg based. I generally just eat rice meat and veg everyday. I can eat the same thing everyday so I'm lucky.
---
My sleep cycle. Arise at 10am or 11 and sleep at 3am or 4am. I already function on 7 hours sleep. 8 is actually too much for me, I feel groggy and have a bad attitude. 
---
Ill also go gym for an hour each day and will properly keep my self clean, showers etc. 
---
Vanilla is a big grind and this is a marathon with minimal outside connection and 8ll be absent the sun. I need to make sure that I don't sacrifice too much of my physique and my own mental health. 
---
Gym ming and keeping groomed is extremely important for me in this regards
---
My point is, if ret paladin is so viable, why can't I find a single full raid where a paladin competes on DPS? 
---
The guy is literally spending 20+ hours farming pummelers for a single raid. You want to compete in DPS in all the raids in vanilla? (Because you will be doing BWL,MC,AQ all in one week at the very least. ) There isn't enough time in a week to farm that many pummelers.
---
OP posted Plate only list so this website isnt really relevant
---
Kind of funny, Ret paladin gear looks basically right but at the same time every piece of gear has +spirit enchants. 
---
I get that maybe you're going for PVE utility to get a lot more mana/5 while not casting but why not just go for some +agi to get more crit / more vengeance uptime?  At least on gloves, 15 agil to gloves is kind of a no brainer, close to 1% bonus crit.
---
Meh i hear you but the thing is some of those min maxers you run into arnt scrubs.
---
And if put in a spot were you have equal skill your going to come out behind them. Absolutley do you this is a game meant to be played to have fun, but some peoples fun comes from min maxxing the absolute piss out of a class and try Harding  to always fight for top spots either in pvp or raids
---
...so much danger that it makes you want to skip entire zones because you're tired of corpse running and spending the majority of your time confused looking at a gray screen with ghost music in the background.
---
Correct. So a Dwarf hunter trainer in Ironforge can train night elf hunters.
---
So I’m coming over and we’re getting to 60 and it’s taking 3-6months.
---
Classic launches at midnight Central European Standard Time (CEST), August 27th (the start of the 27th, not the end).
---
Blizzard has a page showing the launch time in a select number of time zones:
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
The east coast of the US is 3 hours ahead of PDT, so it's 6pm for me. If you need to convert to an appropriate time for you google "time zone converter" for a bunch of websites that will convert.
---
As a single target healer your job is to keep the main tank up. Thus, it is your job to stay alive and heal him. Plate and a shield allows a pally to stay alive longer from melee attacks than clothies. Your healing spells are mana efficient, especially with a free cast every crit.  Mana might be a bit of a struggle in pre raid gear but you'll be fine once better geared.  With that said, my Pally experience is from 15 years ago so it's a bit fuzzy but I was in a top guild who cleared all vanilla content. And I was no clothie wearer.  DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS I GUESS
---
In a 5 man, warriors should expect to tank- even as fury. If you aren't willing to, just roll a rogue instead. Combat rogues and fury warriors are pretty damn similar.
---
Points 3 and 4 don't make much sense. Fury is *the* top dps spec across every raid. There are specific fights where you might not want 10 of them in your raid, but they're few and far between. Warriors *will* be getting priority over most of those other classes you listed, the big competition is from other fury warriors and rogues. If a raid leader thinks remotely about letting a prot warrior have prio on dps gear, just leave that guild immediately.
---
Why does everyone have terrible UIs
---
Leveling a warrior is a trial of patience and mental fortitude!
---
Those were the same dragons?
---
Didn't even know that , played legion enough to run that raid many times too
---
Cool! 
---
I can't wait to slay those bastards in the open world!
---
Follow up question: is azuregos included in those? I know he's a world boss that spawns in azshara but I feel like he was a different color from the other ones?? 
---
I was very very young so I could be wrong
---
Make a Nelf, go to Durator, tame a lvl 2 boar. go to newbies area mind control your pet forgot what that spell was called, let newbies attack your pet kill them. when lvl 60's are hunting you down just shadowmelt.
---
Yeah the non min maxers always poke fun at the min maxers and vice versa. I min max and tryhard but i could care less how anyone else enjoys the game. Your going to find plenty of people who emulate your playstyle. No need to beat on eachother for no reasom its redundant
---
I actually sought out those zones. Hillsbrad and STV were by far the funnest zones due to all the pvp, even though I leveled quite slowly.
---
Well, we have no videos pre 1.12 to contradict this. Patch notes do not note any elite damage changes either. People are trying to argue based on a memory from 15 years ago with no supporting evidence.
---
Everything gets exaggerated with time. Vanilla WoW's difficulty is one of these things.
---
yep
---
Locks don't get a bad set until like tier 9
---
Azuregos is a blue dragon and is a part of Phase 2 along with Dire Maul and Kazzak according to Wowhead :)
---
This was very well done. Thank you. 
---
Vanilla mage here coming back for Classic. Anyone have any suggestions on other players that are this informative when posting videos about classic? Thanks!
---
Horde is an acquired taste, like fine wine.  All jokes aside, I just think that horde races are so different from other games, and so alien that it's a bit of a shock effect, and you need to get used to them. At least, that is how it was for me.
---
I used to main Alliance back in BC - Cata days, but around the end of WotLK I played a bit of Horde as well. When I returned in Legion, I started on Alliance with a friend, and lvled a few chars to their 50s, but ended up jumping ship to Horde. At first I didn't quite like Orgrimmar, but it grew on me, and now I love it.

Guaran-fucking-teed
---
That's so old school vanilla wow it hurts
---
Awesome.
---
Vanilla was so unique and awesome.
---
Actually if you were heavily into the beta streaming almost every top player was horde including soda(...)who switched off alliance because there was not enough players(there is a video of him arguing with Esfand about it). So you really can’t take general population numbers into account especially on a stress tested beta and in a game like this. The general population won’t be hitting 60.
---
Also smaller faction = faster BG queues so PLEASE anyone thinking about going horde please don’t! Thank you!
---
He’s not one of us. Get him!
---
I mean, for 1 &amp; 2 you can just swap on your tank gear because 5 mans aren't difficult.
---
It 100% depends on your guild.  Most of the best guilds will incorporate some form of loot council with the DKP, so that greatly diminishes your chances of getting the weapon.  I'd just make sure when joining a guild that if they say they are going off of DKP, that they are ONLY going off of DKP and that there are no other rules involved.
---
Leeway is in Retail, they never took it out. Calm the fuck down kid.
---
how much are you bulking and from what point (110lbs to 200lbs).
---
&gt;A lot of people are bringing the retail mentality with them to Classic, the same one that made every class feel so similar and the game a boring commodity fest
---
I would argue that everything being so different is exactly why people are agonizing over their decisions.
---
In retail you can just play whatever and do it well unless you are basically mythic racing.
---
Holy FUCK dude.
---
Thank GOD I saw this, I was planning to run all the way from the human starting zone to Teledrassil and alter my leveling route just to get a saber mount by 40 something...
---
Does anyone know how hard it'll be to get exalted with Darnassus via cloth turn-ins as a rogue?
---
This is such a let down though...
---
Frostfire, Bloodfang, Nemesis, Ten Storms, Dreadnought
---
The rank 10 set is pretty decent for most classes, but I would strongly advise still running raids to get good gear before that. Grinding to rank 10 with blue gear will be an utter nightmare.
---
It’s pretty cool. Like you I was a child (and of course a big noob) when Vanilla was around, but I’ve played a bit on private servers and look forwards to a proper experience where I can tryhard a bit more!
---
Off the top of my head, Twin Emps and 4HM. Maybe a few other fights in AQ40/Naxx as well where you won’t have full uptime. Not that it means anyhing, warriors are still the kings, and OP is completely clueless.

Yea. I mean we have plenty time before BGs even get enabled.
---
so you plan to just eat this for a week?
---
pro tip - replace water with chicken stock or veggie stock.
---
So strat live is where people typically reserve an orb for a tank. Why? Because there is nothing in that dungeon for a tank. No gear, no drops, nothing. So why would he come tank it?  It doesn't matter if there are millions of warriors, none of them get shit from running that dungeon. So you will indeed find yourself having to pay a tank to come to strat live.
---
That goes without saying....
---
Hi there! Long time warrior and WoW nerd here. I started in Closed Beta in May 2004, and I've been a Warrior main since 2005. My guild is still Colonial Space Marines of Destromath, with whom I cleared all of Vanilla. Most of my time as Warrior was split evenly between DPS and Tanking roles, so I'll share my personal insights on your list.
---
1. There have been several occasions in dungeons and raids where a clutch taunt + shield equip -&gt; shield wall has saved the day. We got some of our server first kills like this back in OG Vanilla Raiding on Destromath. I don't think it's fair to discount that.
---
2. Warrior DPS is only bad ever if the player at the keyboard is bad. Knowing how to properly cleave and helping the tank spread threat on non-threatening mobs can enable mages and powerful AoE to go harder earlier, resulting in faster clear times in dungeons. I've often run a DPS group without a tank and just leaned heavily on AoE; it works brilliantly and keeps your healers/Mages safe from threat so long as the DPS coordinate.
---
3. I cannot think of a single fight in all of Vanilla raiding where warrior DPS isn't *at least* slightly above average. Even on fights like Onyxia they still perform well. Please share your thoughts on which encounters cause issue.
---
4. The competition for caster weapon drops is *far* more intense than the one for melee. Thanks to racial weapon skill bonuses and items like Edgemasters/Mugger's Belt, a versatile raid guild can and should help smooth out the bottlenecks for melee weapons. There are far more high DPS weapons (40+ DPS) options from Pre-raid, T1, and T2 than there are for any other type of weapons. That's not even counting the use of 2h DPS builds in raiding, which Orcs and Humans can easily make viable (if not 100% min-max optimal) and still put up good numbers.
---
It's doubtful that skipping it would help you speedlevel more than having it.
---
just this for your entire week? o.O
---
They also have far more run down/abandoned towns than Horde.
---
But you want us to care about your opinions
---
1. You do bring other things to the table? ?!!? You CAN TANK. That's a huge bonus. You will never be favored dps in choice in 5mans? Yes you are because you do double the dps of every other class in 5mans. But even if not, you should really consider tanking 5mans as a dps warrior.
---
2. Before 60 you are a tank, hell before raids you are a tank. If you are dpsing dungeons, you are doing something wrong
---
3.  No not at all lmao, warriors are top dps from launch till end.
---
4. You are not competing with paladins and shaman wtf lol. Yes you compete with the others, that's raiding. But because fury warriors rinse meters, they usually get good priority on loot. 
---
Please stop spreading miss information.
---
Don't remember, tbh, but I'm nearly positive lack of class trainers was one of the bigger hurdles for certain people when it came to skipping Darkshore.
---
There is literally videos of a fury warrior dual wield tanking Nefarian in Vanilla. You have zero evidence of your claims that pservers are easier than vanilla. And we have evidence that pservers are harder than vanilla as the bosses numbers have all been overtuned to account for people stacking world buffs.   
---
You don't know what you are talking about man.
---
every raid is going to emulate the "min max" play style.  raids wont let people throw up random debuffs, they will get wbuffs, and they will try to optimize their raid comp.
---
the people who seem upset with this are the ones who want to play a non viable spec
---
nO tImE fOr UtIlItY, mUsT dO BiG dAmAgE
---
You can still use the items if you drop tailoring. For bloodvine you will lose the set bonus if you drop tailoring, but you can still wear them.
---
It's really not that bad. A lot of the assumptions about Warrior leveling is around Private server experience &amp; outdated Vanilla leveling knowledge.  
---
Sure, it still sucks compared to Hunter/Warlock/Mage/Druid but seeing as Warriors regen values are a lot higher than on Private servers, there is a lot less downtime.
---
nice. will you be drinking mostly water? sodas? gatorade?
---
anything to boost focus/energy?
---
So your numbers are values from memory and private servers, but they are *way* off. And then they're just placeholders and wild guesses?
---
I appreciate the effort, but honestly this guide is useless then.
---
Boiled eggs are a great snack with little preparation.
---
Hit gear is your main stat outside of str agi int. Lol
---
shhhhh! let him spook of some competition.
---
It's success isn't really that big of blizzard's problem, they've gone on long enough without having classic servers, and it's development has already been paid for through subs. I don't think they will add mtx at all, but if classic dies they're just gonna shut down the servers and keep xpacs coming. 
---
It would be like that vegan shop offering free chip's with your sandwich, but you need to pay for dip. If no one eats the chip's because the dip isn't free, they'll just stop offering chips.
---
Haven't cooked rice in my instant pot yet. Is that 3 cups of rice dry or pre-cooked?
---
You’re reading too much clickbait. You should ultimately play whichever class/race combo you personally find most enjoyable. The end.
---
Rep, Blacksmithing, Quests, the chance to roll on orbs, Mask of the Unforgiven (Fury BIS).
---
So no I will not indeed be paying a tank to do shit.
---
When my brother decided to take off a week with me and level a shaman. I almost wept in joy. lol
---
&gt; perception helped you fear the rogue before they got an opener
---
Only if you know the rogue is there already.
---
You really think the number of people that would buy Classic collector's edition, if it existed, would be low? People like to collect stuff that connects with their hobbies. It doesn't matter if it doesn't add anything to the hobby itself.
---
The number of people subscribing to get a chance of getting beta access is another example.
---
Private server bias
---
Warriors only top dmg on a handful of raid bosses in naxx, patchwerk and few more.
---
In real vanilla, not some private server where everyone can get flasks and world buffs at all times.
---
According to Activision, a WoW sub is a WoW sub. I feel that if Blizzard can keep the actual numbers of which account is active where, they will just keep pushing the MTX on retail.
---
I don't mind if you don't it doesn't matter.
---
Great guide, thanks a lot!
---
So are you planning on healing dungeons then? What holy talents are you targeting? From what I've read, you don't need to spec holy for that. All that's needed is a set of int gear. 
---
I'd really like to tank so I can get dungeon groups quicker and experience a new aspect of the game.
---
who cares about topping meters when its expected of you? does it really matter if youre first when you're supposed to be?
---
Anyone that takes the game seriously will play on a PvP server regardless of being PvP or PvE oriented.
---
That includes tanks and healers.
---
Healers are in fact crutial part of group PvP so I don't see why you wouldn't want to roll on a PvP server as a healer. You won't be leveling on a healing spec anyways.
---
I expect that for PvP/PvE they will have majority EST/PST servers but I wouldn't be too surprised if they had at least a single offering in MST and CST.
---
I wouldn't expect it for RP servers though, probably sticking to EST/PST there.
---
And rip RP-PVP
---
Pre-60 not much matters because it will all be replaced quickly, IMO.
---
At 60 pre-raid, I'd say UBRS will offer the best bang for your buck.
---
Dal'Rend's swords are BiS for combat pre-raid, IIRC, and you can also get great bracers, helm, ring, cloak, and trinket.
---
Same here, but I started Vanilla day 1, quit at lvl 33 and went back to Everquest. Came back to WoW at BC and without ever doing a vanilla raid and that's all I really want to see now.
---
" So not ANY Warrior will tank in ANY spec. Some Warriors will suck and go Prot for the safety net. "  
---
But thats not what you originally said. This is what you said:  
---
" It goes beyond just those things. It's basic midigation and long drawn out trash pulls/adds that take a toll on a single healer. You spec Prot so the group runs smoother as fresh 60 healers aren't as well geared either. "  
---
But there is like next to no talents in the prot tree that actually give mitigation. You clearly don't know that. You are listening to some youtube videos and pretending to be an expert.
---
i really hope so lol
---
Scrubs don't minmax.  I think you misunderstand what a scrub is.

---
I have a high tolerance for eating the same shit every day, so Lunch/Dinner type meals will be the chicken/rice thing. I tried chicken/veggie stock a few times, and it definitely helps the flavor, but the sodium goes through the roof.
---
Breakfast is usually Oatmeal with a scoop of chocolate protein powder. 
---
Those 3 meals, if I stick to them, will be ~1600 cals/day. I plan to keep lifting and doing light cardio, so add another protein shake (150 cals) and a few snacks (almonds or yogurt) should put me right around 2100/day, which is a slight deficit for me. 
---
I'm sure my wife will make some food along the way as well, so those chicken meals can stretch out a little further.
---
Haha yep pretty much the same scheme as mine, really makes you wonder how nobody else thought of it
---
Yeah it would be hard to essentially go back and unlearn what we know now. Starts, debuff prio etc. But i dont belive every single guild will bother with worldbuffs. I was in a pserv guild who never bothered. Granted we only got through MC but it was never even a thought. But i agree with your general statement
---
fasting is a bitch. I can, have been doing intermitten fasting but been trying to break the 24 hour mark, I keep failing. IDK how I used to do it, but upper 30s, once the 20hr mark hits and I havent eaten, my body goes into auto-pilot directly to the kitchen. T___T

Fury vs Prot makes literally no difference for UBRS lmao. What is this "Prot safety net"? Can you explain what that means?
---
Right now I'm at \~165 lean (185 comfy), trying to get at least up to 175 lean by next year. Partially using it as motivation to make a Headmaster's Charge prop to make up for never getting one in Vanilla.
---
100% this. Also, don’t forget that all the talk about ideal DPS, healing, tanking, etc assumes basically perfect play and execution of class mechanics on the part of all parties involved. This isn’t as common as this sub makes it seem: most players aren’t perfecting their rotations to a game tick, most players aren’t going to have all the BiS gear, most players simply aren’t going to be playing at a high enough level for this min-maxing stuff to make a significant difference.
---
If your goal isn’t to be in literally the top raiding or pvp guild on your server then don’t let min-maxing determine how you play. And even if that is your goal you can probably make it work with a suboptimal build.
---
My only gripe with playing Paladin will be in gearing. It may sound dumb but I just don't want to wear dresses and such as a Paladin. If I were a Druid or Priest I'd be fine with it, but Paladin is a big no for me. I'm not planning on going too hard, fairly casual and would be playing with friends too. Can I get away with wearing mostly plate/mail mostly? I'm OK with like, cloth bracers or something, and even some leather but not into the whole dress thing. Again not planning on going too hard core. Wondering about the viability of this overall.
---
It’s crazy isn’t it? Almost like people have different taste or something.
---
Yes, it’s very good weapon even when progressing through Nax. I was rank 10 with Athena and frighten owned as a spriest.. then I would switch it for raids. It was a great feeling. Just make sure you have the eye of shadow when the other part drops from the chest.. you’ll get over soemoen that does not have it. Just link it a bunch of times if it drops. It was an awesome quest good luck :)
---
During the Earnings calls the past few quarters, Classic was mentioned once, and it was pretty much just to supplement them having no other releases this year other than Diablo Immortal. It feels like Classic is hardly on Activision's radar.
---
When you see spirit in green on the tooltip, it's a wowhead bug, it should be white because it's the item stats, not the enchant. Enchant are just belllow in another tooltio and i never used spirit
---
Beer
---
Guaranteed he's a linux-beard too
---
Damage meters don't matter
---
Warriors do everything (but aoe trash tanking) better. They take less damage and they do more threat. Sorry but there is nothing more to the story.
---
I used to sit at Booty Bay AH and buy stuff people were transferring between factions. Made 10's of thousands of gold doing this as someone who played mostly twinks.
---
Pressing 1 button is so fun! Real engaging game play.
---
Yea, my eye dominance shifted a couple of years ago, it used to be pretty hard to shoot right handed while left eye dominant, so I just shot lefty, wasn't exactly comfortable but at least I could hit stuff. Something happened and my right eye is dominant now though.
---
3 cups dry. Depending on your brand of pot you may need to adjust the liquid levels, but mine usually vents anything extra anyway, so I find it better to over-liquid with rice than not put enough in. The best way to do it is to cook the rice separately, since if you cook it for 14 minutes (like I do) you tend to overcook the rice. But I really don't care, and I'm lazy when it comes to food prep, I want the quickest way with the least cleanup possible.
---
Enjoy
---
I think the progression from vanilla to TBC to was fast for most of the population to get through Nax.
---
literally when would you need any utility outside of like tranq shot for MC and even then its like 2-3 hunters. classic bosses are easy, beating them faster is the only challenge
---
lol that mask is not BiS! There will not be plenty of tanks wanting to do it. And the ones you get will be not even in prebis gear so they won't be doing a great job or going very fast. Just give first orb to a good tank and the whole instance runs better.
---
Fixed the weapon
---
Yes because the game relies on a social hierarchy that is visual in nature. Any visual change acquired out of game is destructive to the fabric of an mmorpg setting.
---
Leaders of the fang for wingblade is very nice, although if you skip WC for some reason (I tend to do so since a bad wc run is really painful) then in BFD you just need to kill one of the bosses for Strange Water Globe drop quest which gives you Outlaw Blade which is sick. Then into the scarlet monastery and Bring the Light (RFD) are ur next sword upgrade quests, followed by Thrash Blade quest from Mara, corruption of seed and earth or something like that is the name. Then u run UBRS for days trying to get Dal Rends set at 60.
---
The issue with that is bloodvine won't come out until ZG, meaning you would have to not have engineering for that long.
---
The robe of the archmage, robe of the void and truefaith vestments require tailoring to wear, not sure what happens if it's on you and you drop tailoring.
---
Plus it seems a bit of an overkill for me to level tailoring, craft a very expensive item then drop tailoring immediately. 
---
I would suggest getting a gathering profession plus tailoring and dropping the gathering profession for engineering instead.
---
I'll play a warrior and I will become a great tank. What saddens me is that dual spec doesnt exist, so I will have to take my prot warrior into pvp as well.
---
 If I were you I wouldnt worry so much about the downsides you think there will be. Warlocks are a great class for leveling and for pvp and the debuff limit ony really matters in big raids. People love warlocks for the convenient portals and soul stones and health stones. Sparing a bag for shards is not that bad. Sure, some races are resistant to charms and fears, but you know what they are not resistsnt to? Damage. And you have lots of that. Just look at Snutz almost winning the duel tournament on warlock against horde players.
---
I get where you are coming from though. People keep saying druids are worthless at most things...then you have people like Skarm detailing how a Bear can Tank Naxx as long as you know how to play around its weaknesses. Every class is unique and has a justification for being in the game. Also never choose a race just for racials. Choose the character you want to be. Even if that means you wont have the extra Intelligence from being a Gnome. I assure you that you will stop playing a character that you didnt want to be, even if it does more damage or has more stun resist.
---
Int? What class or spec has int as their second best stat?
---
As someone who's biggest gripe with Paladin healing being having to wear a dress, thank you. I'll have to give this a shot and see what happens! At least I'll enjoy it, and I assume this can't be that much worse than the traditional BiS lists with the cloth/leather that's normally found on those.
---
&gt; but honestly this guide is useless then.
---
The guides focus is not on the actual pricings and gains, but about the farms themselves.
---
If you can provide better estimates and real values then please do, otherwise please refrain from negative comments.
---
I wont reply to this again.

Outside of sp, sorry mr over anal.

---
The poster you're replying to didn't say what you're implying they did.
---
They noted that raid DPS would have first crack and that after that it would be open to off-specs/PVP/etc. He just said good luck because there are going to be a ton of people in that same group as the Paladin.
---
They don’t level the slowest. If you’re leveling slowly as a warrior then you’re doing it wrong.
---
Tell me what you think is wrong and i will always look into it. I'm not saying i will have everything good first try, but i always take feedback and improve the bis list
---
well thats because it hasnt made its mark yet, no one knows how many concurrent players it will have, but with how terrible retail is these days i think it really is possible Classic will have more players
---
It's an exaggeration. You have to clear Naxx a lot, which by itself is pretty difficult since people tend to quit the game after killing KT considering themselves to have "beaten" WoW.
---
My fault then.
---
Good luck getting TERs as pre-bis
---
Not to take blacksmithing and engineering as I level a warrior as my first toon
---
In phase 2, this is how me and my boys are going to farm honor on people's major guild's raid nights:

when I fasted 20-22 hours and only eating 1000 calories, I had plenty of energy and felt much more alert. I would bike to work, after work bike to the gym and did strength training with only bcaa or pre-workout mixture w/ very little calories. 
---
deadlift, squats, bench presses, barbells, 1 hr of strength training and toning and was totally fine. Still had energy to come home and fuck my gf b4 eating chicken/fish + 1 type of green + 1 type of non-green. no rice/pasta

I don't miss those meals tho.. so fucking boring.
---
psmf?
---
Tell me the items and phase etc.. If you want me to look into it

Yes everything is "viable".
---
Boars are by far the best PvP pet, but you have to use charge manually.  Having an extra snare trumps all the other pet abilities.
---
Warriors cannot sit spam in classic. 
---
Warriors leveling on a fresh server don't have access to boe gear constantly. 
---
A fresh 60 server warriors are the slowest solo levelers.
---
but shouldn't the priest be healing?
---
why would one care about damage meters? 
---
something im not getting here
---
I was working 76 hour weeks when Classic came out, so my play style was just casually running around solo with my hunter.  Sometimes I'd join a dungeon group or do a WSG, but mostly I was just running around seeing the world.
---
This time I'm going to absolutely poopsock it and make MC my bitch.
---
Possibly a mistake, i'll look into it
---
I think that they're going to incorporate crossover items, or kind of like Blizzcon style of stuff, you get certain things in all their games, so even if you only play one you feel like it's worth it. It's smart.
---
now that makes more sense
---
You should prolly do the HoTW spec.  Can tank 5 mans, DPS 5 mans, Heal 5 Mans and performs decently in PVP.
---
What exactly are you going to farm on your own that gives you more gold than strat live? Strat live is minimum 1 orb per hour. Top end, it's 2-3 orbs an hour, a prisitine black diamond, a flask recipe, a mage tome recipe.
---
It wont be very successful dw
---
I agree that +healing is better then spellcrit for most of the content.  And I don't even try to argue that cloth won't be best in slot. I just want to note that if you don't chase shortest clears or server first that amount of min maxing won't be necessary. 
---
Our guild worked itself through MC/BWL with half the people in talent builds that where rather farming or PVP focussed, two mages who absolutely refused to wear anything but staves, a hunter who wouldn't equip anything but guns and 4 paladins who absolutely refused to wear dresses, some even refusing to wear non-plate. Partly for PvP reasons, partly style. 
---
Equipment sometimes went for 2-3 weeks unenchanted because the person didn't have the funds for it or didn't bother with it. 
---
Heck even half of AQ fell and the first few bosses of Naxx.
---
While yes progress was slower then other guilds we kept our roster consistent by being casual. 
---
I rather have a dwarfen hunter who only uses guns even if he has access to far better drops and preffers a bear for optics as a pet that shows up reliable on time as LeroyxXX the min maxed fury warrior who plays 16 hours a day, can name the best in slot for every content phase from memory and won't mind at all to respecc for every single raid and leaves the guild to a progress oriented one as soon as he got enough drops from us to get there.  At least the dwarf will stay with the raid.
---
Heigan, Nefarian
---
Right, but Activision won't have that data. It is the biggest benefit of there not being a "Classic only subscription" option. Blizzard is well aware how important it is to keep Classic as pure as possible, and say what you will about them, they want to keep it that way.
---
I started playing WoW in 2007, Alliance since day one. Met some of my best friends on Madoran server. I recently faction switched my main and i would never go back after being able to actually play PVP *and win*
---
Yeah, that's pretty much what I currently think my main will become.
---
Probably 4 weeks after AQ releases.  They'll start with server transfers.  After all gates are open, no reason not to.  Then as things get a little slower they'll add in rename tokens and race change tokens (which also allow your cosmetics to change if you remake the same race).  First they'll have cooldowns, then they'll get reduced and eventually removed.
---
Give it some time around 3 weeks past Phase 6 launch, they'll start filling it up with a bunch of "cosmetic only" things.  Starting with pets and/or mounts.  After that, all bets are off as they try to bolster numbers with everything they can think of, including at least one brand new realm to re-cycle all the phases but with all the cash grab stuff from the start, including game altering things like mounts with sidecars.
---
Population will die and everyone will shit on them from selling out, and they'll still keep doing it in an even higher capacity.  Private servers will be created using the Classic client and phase rollout plan, sans layering.  They'll probably be very popular and all in EU time zones.  Blizz will blame the player base saying they really didn't want WoW Classic after all.  They will continue down the same path.  They'll also fail at Diablo 4 and all their other cash grabs.  10 years from now people will still be playing Starcraft Brood War, Warcraft 3, and Diablo 2 and will be wondering what happened to this company.
---
I'd say that is a best case scenario, worst case we can expect them to release the server transfers in late phase 2, name and/or race changes before phase 3 ends, and so on and so forth in an expedited manner, peaking before phase 6 releases.
---
0/30/21 is a very versatile spec. You should be able to tank most 5-mans as well as heal. 
---
This gives you the flexibility to go up to Nature's swiftness in resto (one of your only "oh shit" buttons) and take the majority of good tanking talents in feral (leaving out Leader of the Pack obviously).
---
I think you need to take a look outside of your usual bubble of influence. If we take just this sub, 144k members, that ain't shit to WoW's subscription totals. The die hard "I want to hate myself for raiding through naxxramas" attitude this sub has is a VERY small minority. This game's success is predicated on one thing, the amount of money it generates. If all 144k members of this sub refused to play, that would be about 1% of wow's maximum playerbase. Just because this sub feels super entitled because they "Delivered a petition directly to Mike Moreheim's desk" doesn't mean this game has to fit all of their demands. 
---
The long and the short of it is simple, if more players want to be able to race change/server transfer/gender swap than players who don't want that in the game, it will be added to the game. If more players wants WoW tokens so they can farm gold in game for a subscription, it will be added to the game.
---
And before you get defensive, I'm not trying to advocate for these things to be added. I do kinda want the ability to server transfer if my server is randomly one of the dead servers, but I understand the importance of not having that in a game like classic. I just want to point out that we in this sub are a very small minority in terms of wow's playerbase.
---
Prot warriors are bad in PvP.  People just killer their healer, CC the warrior and ignore them.
---
sure but a collector's edition isn't the same as mtx.   
---
&gt; The number of people subscribing to get a chance of getting beta access is another example. 
---
it's not an example of people willing to spend their money on mtx.
---
as a priest no less lol
---
i think its a bit ridiculous to believe that the amount of people subscribed to this subreddit constitute a majority of wow classic players. I'd guess that the reddit population will be less than 1/10th
---
Cocaine and water I guess

What is the best seal/judgement rotation while leveling?

Now this is ~~podracing~~ proper gearing!

I could do this in WoTLK but not before then.

beer, sugar?!?! hey whatever works for you - that would crash me. Then again redbull doesnt do shit for me, nor does beef jerky, however when I combine the two - holy fuck I am cracked out and IDK WHY.
---
lol "so I need to be clear in saying I absolutely love it.".... ohhh, to be naive and think you'll be able to keep your GF w/ wow! lol, I jest, that's cute tho
---
i love your post, probably the most realistic outcome
---
Showers... You filthy... You clean casual!
---
They literally have the source code and server data. They literally have an unmodified 1.12 reference server/client that they test against. That doesn't mean they can't make mistakes. But it does mean they have a reference point to get it exactly right if they need to.
---
no no he does not
---
Gnome rogue twink
---
Mask of the Unforgiven is Phase 1 pre-BIS until you get Lionheart Helm which isn't going to happen until early because the recipe has an incredibly low drop rate off Ragnaros, Onyxia, and world bosses.
---
I'd rather teach a new tank than pay someone. If I get into a group with someone that decides to demand payment, I will agree, and then wipe them by pulling the entire instance.
---
Does spell hit% affect %resisted damage?
---
Is it bad I already booked a hotel for a week and planned a "business trip" so wife and kids arent a factor?
---
i love the cosmo theme

I kinda want that too... I rerolled way too often. I wonder how far I could have gotten if I put all my time into one character! :o
---

Is she a porn star or something?
---
As a priest, when I see a mage dominating the damage meters, I tell them that they need to sing praise of my name as a healer or I will take *everything* from them. I will DI the mages that praise me, and turn my back on those who refuse. Good luck topping damage meters from the graveyard, plebs. DoTs, HoTs, and smashin thots. Priestgang, scrubs.
---
Get one of the old epic mounts! Oh, wait.
---
oh boy more warrior propaganda to make them seem not as overpowered as reality.  classic will be easy as fuck so CC/utility is not nearly as important as damage.  warriors have good cleave, are tanky, and don't need mana.  the MDI comp for classic would be 4 fury warriors and a resto shaman
---
trust us, warriors aren't that great!  we only have the most damage and are the only real tank.  b-but we're hard to level so that justifies not paying the hybrid tax
---
We have client side vanilla wow available to us. That's what you'd use to play on a private server. Blizz also has access to 1.12 server side code. The question is whether 1.12 had undocumented number changes compared to earlier patches, that Blizz doesn't have access to anymore.
---
casual. this is for those who are speed leveling to 60. Less downtime, more game time. We exist.
---
As I said you are incorrect. You can wear robe of the void and truefaith once you have dropped tailoring. They are BOP once you craft them. Meaning you have to be 300 tailoring to craft the item, but once you make it, you can drop tailoring and still wear the item.
---
The lure of bigger numbers can be a big pull. :)
---
But yea not having any hit wasn't the plan but we saw no anglistas grasp or neltharions tear in 8 months of raiding, I'm guessing I'm probably at 4% hit in that screenshot, it was just an extremely unlucky sequence and far from the norm.
---
deli meats and cheese don't make you feel sleepy?
---
&gt; Are they going to announce anything about them before launch?
---
At least a 99.999% chance.
---
Because you'd expect this anyway, but also because it's related to the Layering system.
---
Although I highly doubt there'll only be 1 server per type and time zone, I did think their choice to not separate languages in the EU was curious, and stupid obviously, but curious because it says something about either how many layers they want to have per server, or their expected popularity, or a bit of both.
---
If they aren't going to have different language servers in the EU, this suggests they only want to have a couple of servers of each type at most.
---
So, assuming they keep with their decision to have no RP-PvP, EU may only have 6 or 9 named servers. Which means they may be planning to have more than 5 layers per server (i.e. possibly exceeding 20,000 concurrent players per named server).
---
&gt; The best way to do it is to cook the rice separately, since if you cook it for 14 minutes (like I do) you tend to overcook the rice. But I really don't care, and I'm lazy when it comes to food prep, I want the quickest way with the least cleanup possible.
---
Same same same. Lately I've been making chicken thighs in the instant pot, then pouring that water and more in the rice cooker to make delicious rice. If I can cut out that 2nd step and have 1 less thing to clean... hell yeah.
---
If you can’t play classic for 2-3 hours a day then you shouldn’t play at all. It will take you way too long just to hit 60.
---
I had the opposite idea. My old main's name is Lamehealer.
---
Emphasis on this. Cool stuff coming from achieving stuff in game is very important.
---
Otherwise we get skin wars 2
---
Troll look cooler though
---
Pick Pocket can get resisted in Classic and then you die.
---
Well it wont be out in phase 1 so ill get maraudon and ubrs rings, but everyone who isnt going to lvl fast or those that starts later, will try to get TER
---
I'm not the one writing a guide, onus isn't on me to provide better "real" values. I'm just glad you didn't give away the actual good gold spots for leveling.
---
This was definitely a thing during Vanilla. I don't know if it was removed before 1.12, though.
---
I think people need to realize that where you class ends up on the DPS meter doesn't mean shit. Classes (specs) in vanilla are not that competitive when it comes to the DPS meter. Your position on the meter is going to entirely depend on what spec/class you are playing, not the skill of the player playing the class.
---
There are going to be plenty of shitty mages/warriors that are at the top of the meter even though they make the most common mistakes. 
---
Basically just do the most DPS the game allows your spec to achieve, play a class you enjoy and don't roll a class just to be in a certain spot on the meter. Because the meter doesn't reflect how good you are, only that you picked one of the top classes.
---
I would rather have a Feral/Warlock/Hunter that is doing everything right than a mage who's out DPSing them by pressing frostbolt
---
Right on - I guess everyone's body is different and metabolizes at different rates depending on activity/size etc... cheers.
---
Katy t3h PeNgU1N oF d00mKaty t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m incarnated
---
The core part of my argument is based on the sales pitch I believe defines classic, and I believe adding their shop breaks that, you can disagree with that though.
---
I think the fact they told us we don't want classic and yet still ended up making it might give them pause to retail-ify classic. If people wanted retail they would play retail. Hell a lot of them will still own the expac and it could be available, why risk alienating people making two of the same thing.
---
What vendor / item is that green?
---
If you are fucking blizzard, and your job is class balance, then it sure as fuck does.   Guy should have been fucking fired.
---
That’s a pretty clean ui for vanilla.  Nice work
---
Well then you are just wasting your own time as much as everyone else's. People will hate you and stop playing with you. Meanwhile I will tank orb runs and make plenty of money because most players aren't as impractical as you. Most people understand that if they give 1 orbs to a good tank (which he will probably win anyway) their run will be faster and smoother than if they find a tank that doesn't even have a helm better than mask of the unforgiven LOL.
---
Since when can pets stun or interrupt??
---
Answer: Since WLK or since you put the point in intimidation in the BM talent tree. 
---
WLK is not classic and the question was about pet families and not talents.
---
Ehm.. warriors are the highest DPS in the game?
---
Pizza rolls, sticks of friedbutter, and sunny D.
---
I can’t find anywhere that this was the case for BFA or any other xpac. Wowhead seems to indicate that it probably does not include prepurchases.
---
Well if you're referring to showdown you don't even have to think or worry about EVs and IVs as they are all already maxed.  
---
Which makes it sort of a disingenuous comparison because EVs and IVs can be considered one of the more (most?) time-consuming portions of minmaxing a team. It's the part people would be most likely to actually skip in a practical Pokemon game experience.
---
We've been through more than one expansion or content launch together which is why I've got a fairly consistent outline,  although this is indeed the largest and greatest test.

---
As shown in the above meters of my old guild.  Cat is viable, and Bear tank is inferior, so why do it at all?
---
The actual vanilla endgame experience - you go in a boy and come out a man
---
haha i hope so, gonna need support for the pvp server!
---
Each 5 man requires 1 tank for 3 DPS.  There are way more than 3x as many DPS as there are tanks.  The end.
---
Fury tanks do just fine in all dungeons.
---
If my friends and I end up in a group with a tank trying to negotiate payment, we'll just agree and then "accidentally" wipe him over and over until he quits. Those repair bills will teach him.
---
Prot isnt good. Your damage is so low you just aren’t a threat. Arms or fury is much better as you are a killing machine with a healer behind youz
---
Collector's edition would have vanity items like pets. There's no real difference. It doesn't matter if there's no big "Cash Shop" sign anywhere.
---
you won't need to wear cloth when leveling
---
but in the first phase of raiding you'll be gimping yourself for no reason if you refuse to wear cloth, you're basically turning a strength of the class - ability to wear any armor type - into a weakness by only wearing less optimized types of armor
---
if you don't plan to raid, then go wild and wear all plate. but if you refuse to wear dresses when raiding you won't perform well and your guildies will resent you for not trying your best and relying on them to pick up the slack.
---
that said, there are some pretty good plate pieces in the later phases. but don't expect to actually get them if you refuse to wear dresses. 
---
I'm not saying you have to wear ONLY the best in slot items when raiding, there are loads of good options for any given slot, but by refusing to wear the best ones you're severely gimping yourself and will struggle to RELIABLY find a spot in raids that clear more difficult content. Robes of the exalted look dorky on a paladin, but its a really good robe. you can just switch to your robes for raids then switch back when not raiding.
---
Or you could just not raid. that's an option too. In dungeons plate is acceptable.
---
You play around it. I was lock main since vanilla. Loved every second of it. Quirks are just that.
---
protein sparing modified fasting.
---
basically only proteins 2,5g/kg and thats it.
---
Rep in strat live? You run undead or scholo for that. Blacksmithing? Who the hell is running strat live for Blacksmithing?! People run live once and get those quests done. If they are doing it for quests, they are surely an ungeared tank.
---
You enjoy running strat live at a snail's pace with a terrible tank. I will tank strat live w my engi shield and sappers for people who understand the value of a good one :)
---
Yeah, but the recipe only drops from Ragnaros and Onyxia in phase 1 at a terribly low drop rate, so good luck with that.
---
Yeah it's BiS! Diet as well so I don't get a sugar high haha.
---
Maybe it's a highe shadow-resistance. Have you tried whether fire-spells hit more often?
---
... should they? High protein, low carb.
---
PVE feels like playing on easy mode, the most dangerous enemies are the players and you strip it out of the game in a PVE server.
---
Here’s an idea. Get a job.
---
Played feral tank in vanilla.  You can at the very least off tank in most any raid, and main tank any dungeon without issue.  One of the main benefits a prot warrior brings to any group or raid is sunder armour.  Faerie Fire is only worth about 1 stack of sunder armour.  So if you are main tank as feral, a dps warrior would need to spend rage/time applying sunder armour.  They also have strong cooldowns like last stand and shield wall.  All that said feral has it's own strengths, and it can be very fun.  You get a group buff, battle rez, the potential use of CC abilities, pre-healing yourself with HoT's before you pull, barkskin, etc.  
---
However you will have to farm for some specific gear.  Some of it is BoE world drops, others are BoP drops with random enchantments that can take awhile to get the right combination of stats.  Feral tanks have very high armour, good dodge, 2 taunt abilities, in form healing, and potentially the highest single target threat.  They are weaker to mobs that do spell damage, which is why stacking stamina is important.  Taurens get 5% increased HP, but night elves get access to blessing of kings.  Of course you won't always be grouped with a paladin, except in raids.  Good luck and remember to always wear gear with the highest armour value!
---
We'll see once tanks get more established gear. Its the same mantra on live WoW, just bring more DPS and kill bosses faster. Who cares is healers are spam healing the tank, they won't run OOM because you kill the boss before that.
---
The majority of raiders in classic were loot whores, that's why there was so much drama over loot and loot systems.
---
But I'm guessing you didn't play vanilla.
---
Yah, that extra day played certainly justifies being broken as fuck for 2 years.
---
No kidding
---
Online petitions are worthless especially the ones towards private companies
---
Wrong. I really have no reason to farm Strat Live, at all. I have no reason to farm anything, at all.
---
I bike commute and am a goddamn endless pit of calories, but since I won't be burning that while I'm on PTO I'll be switching my meal plan &amp; exercise routine to look something like this:
---
\-Hardboiled eggs (salt, pepper, Frank's)  &amp; granola bars for snacks.  I'm partial to Kind bars, Kashi cereal bars and the generic Whole Foods cereal bars, although the last one is pretty sugar heavy even if delicious
---
\-One pot meals frozen in advance.  My usual defaults are turkey chili, turkey bolognese and taco chicken w/ rice &amp; veggies
---
\-Soylent/multivitamins to fill any nutrient gaps
---
\-Grubhub the rest when I'm feeling lazy, which I anticipate will happen often during week 2.
---
I'm going to try to get a 20 mile ride in each morning, do a little yoga for strength and not abuse my body too badly.  I'll be intermittent fasting and just eating one big meal a day with snacks to supplement the rest.  I'm a small dude and I look at nutrition &amp; fitness with a calories in/calories out kind of mentality.  If i'm burning around 500-600 calories riding, I should be able to not look like a pile of shit by the time I hit 60.
---
For drinks, it's water exclusively.  Soda kills you, get rid of it!
---
Well in that guy’s group in particular he was about as many runs/day as possible. So it was on group loot. If you rolled when you weren’t supposed to then you got kicked.  He had a macro detailing exactly what the rules were once the group was made. Anyone who played even a moderate amount knew how the groups were run; fair but no tolerance for not following the established rules.
---
Paladins are amazing friends to have.
---
Better questing imo
---
We can get the rod of being a furborg
---
We get white tigers from winter spring
---
We have it easier getting to the raids.
---
We have 2 populated active cities. If and sw.
---
Meanwhile orgrimmar is just the main place peeps go as horde.
---
Alliance premades are probably better than horde ones, on paper, due to strong pally blessings.
---
Early blessing of salvation for raids makes it dpsing more fluid, esp for warlocks.
---
Iirc, alliance have it easier in av.
---
Yo Aubrey, if you’re out there and want to experience something new, I can help you with that fake orcgasm. Holler at me boo.
---
when leveling any spec can do anything. gear is much more important. keep a set of + int and +healing gear for when you need to heal and you'll do just fine healing as ret or prot
---
No, they're not...
---
Being patched out of 2.1 doesn't mean it was vanilla behavior.  It could have been a bug introduced in 2.0.  Only Blizzard knows for sure.
---
Blizzard's marketing team would never allow prepurchase figures to be ignored like that. It makes absolutely no sense.
---
Clearly a superior healer over u/SufficientBandaidMan
---
Red Star v Partizan in Belgrade
---
No warrior is going to want mask of the unforgiven after like 3 weeks at 60 so that point is just so silly.
---
Ya he has his own unique terrible twist. He NEEDs plate but not for PvP for pre raid. For some weird reasons the voices in his head have come up with. It's DIFFERENT.
---
its already confirmed that /sit doesnt trigger abilities
---
I’m looking
---
This is a big concern for me as a shaman player who won’t raid much due to life. The 60 boots are trash compared to the lvl 58 ones if you running elemental. I’d argue even the chest piece from 60 is worse than the 58 one as well. However I’m rolling mage this time around Bc I don’t want to deal with this and also need to make gold fast solo.
---
Shhh, thats their attempt at humor.
---
Either way, it's going to happen, just at a later point compared to Pservers. 
---
People are still going to breeze through MC the second week of the game.
---
Raiding on a nice computer instead of just praying some mechanics don't kill me while I'm frozen for 5 seconds at a time.
---
Something is really familiar about this map.
---
the /sit was never in vanilla and isnt in classic. its a private server bug
---
Vanilla spells are confusing as hell. But basically all spell misses show up as resist, even though they are misses.
---
This is more of a bug abuse, but during cata when firelands released, a new zone was released with it. This zone gave blacsmithing reciepes, but you had to get to a certain point in the quest chain before being able to get theese reciepes. I stockpiled all mats required far in advance, and I abused a bug which meant that which quests was available reset at 02:00 but daily quests reset at 03:00, this meant that you could get a sort of extra reset on the random dailies. This was fixed after a day or so, but I still managed to get a single day ahead of the other people. When I unlocked the blacksmithing reciepes, no one else on my server had them. I sold only the finished items, I refused to craft for others. The mats of the items were around 10-15k, so even with a 5k fee it'd be absolutely no reason for me to accept it when all my items kept selling on the AH for 80k and in person for 80k. The very next day, the items were down to 10k each. But I had made 2 mill in that one day, because I was literally the only supplier. Lots of angry people after that, but that's why I had used a bank alt for it.
---
Its basically the same as retail wow. So if you can run retail you’ll be ok in classic
---
sor was never meant to proc stuff to begin with
---
In the Orc campaign, which is like a little RPG/adventure game starring Rexxar, one of your main allies is Chen Stormstout, a Pandaren Brewmaster.
---
I have the same thoughts about vanilla. At first I wanted to level a mage up, but playing on private servers I see that pretty much everyone in the game also wants to level a mage. So, I decided to revive my absolute first character ever, a Tauren Druid, just for the insane flexibility and survivability that druids have. That way I'll have a comfortable ride to 60 (can run away from mobs with travel form while healing myself if a fight gets out of hand, can instantly travel to moonglade if my hearth is on CD, etc. etc) and can depend solely on myself for everything other than dungeon runs. I think it's a great choice for the first character.
---
If you have no time to raid, you definitely have no time to even think about rank 13 gear lol.
---
???? Okay ????
---
Or, I'll just get a mod (if I'm not one myself) of the realm discord to mute all tanks looking to sell runs. Good luck finding a group then!
---
Can’t show underwear on Twitch
---
At 45 get Thrashblade asap. You’ll be using this weapon for a very long time.
---
Why stop at pants? Get that bare ass so stuck to your leathery seat that a bit peels off when you go piss (or just have your mom come to the basement and help with a poop bucket)
---
Not at lvl 29, feign death comes at the 30s
---
UBRS is a 10/15 man dungeon, you have to farm the bosses in LBRS until you have 3 gems, the gems are low drop rate and everyone in the grp wants them. So it isnt because youre lazy, its more that the chances are really low and that theres other more important dungeons to farm for gear. 
---
But UBRS and LBRS is in the same instance, and lbrs is only a 5 man, so you can farm it with 10 man if your guild wants it.
---
You're still wearing dresses in raids. PvP ,plate was definitely the way to go though.
---
Yeah they are. Regarding your other reply: play a different game if you don’t like it.
---
Balancing doesn’t have to be justified in classic, it’s a remake of vanilla.
---
Back in 2007, my buddy and I planned to move servers, so we did market research and found silk cloth to be almost 3x the price on the new server, so we literally put about 5k gold each into silk cloth and a few other items with similar prices, and sold them all after the xfer.
---
Blizzard tracked this, and deemed it against the rules, and deleted literally every item that was not equipped on our characters, and removed our fast flying skill (it cost 5k gold to train at the time).
---
At the very least you can probably attribute warrior dps to a mistake on blizzard's part. Turns out it's pretty good to have a resource that's based on doing and receiving damage. More damage means more rage, which means more damage, which means more rage. It just surprises me that warriors were never dealt with, given blizzard's obvious intent of making the hybrid dps specs severely lower than pure class dps.
---
guess I should be posting my plan out.
---
What I plan to prep in advance, salsa, marinara sauce, pico de gallo.
---
I will have some peruvian dishes already made like Ceviche and Causa and also Tikka Masala sauce prepped in advance. 2 of them are cold dishes that don't need to be heated. The Tikka Masala I only need to cook the rice and heat the sauce with prepped shredded chicken and tofu. 
---
After those prep food runs out, I doubt I will be cooking at all and plan to ubereats, grubhub, postmate, whatever and focus on Chinese, Thai, Indian food.
---
I will try to stay away from steaks, bbq and heavy pasta dish since they all give me the Itis. Spicy food keeps me up and healthy for your internal organs. 
---
I will be drinking 80% water, 20% energy drinks ala redbull, cold brew, gatorade. 
---
my go to boost / snack is redbull + beef jerky. Something about this combination get's me wired AF and able to push an extra 1-2 hours before passing out. I've done many road trips and drove 25 hours in 1 seating, other than stretching - redbull/beef jerky had me focus. 
---
I also do intent to fast or try to. From previous fasting experience, I do feel more energetic and focus. It's just starting the fast is the hardest thing. However I am hoping the game will have my attention and lose track of time, to ignore food. I would like to atleast hit a 40 hour fast 2-3 times in 10 days. My reason is mostly, I am dieting and trying to lose weight. I am comfortable being 140-150 and not 180-190. Mostly a vanity issue - I want my flat stomach back. I've been drinking too much and getting too much sweets and dessert past several months that bloated me up.
---
Yep. When I see a sword and board, I CC and kill someone else.
---
So yeah, even with my unlimited gold, I will never buy a run from a tank and do everything in my power to squash their chances of being successful.
---
&gt;Yeah, it's almost like Blizzard wanted them to be good at EVERYTHING in endgame to make up for the horrible grind they have to get to 60 and to get geared right after.
---
You really think they thought it out that much?  If so, you are fucking delusional lol.
---
If you want to be a melee dps and top meters then play a warrior. 
---
Seriously, there are plenty of patches throughout TBC WotLK and Cata where certain classes and specs were stronger than others.
---
All the databases are wrong, and since beta is lvl 40 rn, theres no way to test it

---
TFT specifically refers to the expansion. I was being specific because they weren't officially part of the lore in RoC ("Reign of Chaos", the subtitle of the base game), although they were an April fool's joke from before the game's release when they were still announcing the different factions.
---
Are you a gay?
---
lol what are you even talking about? People aren't going to use a realm discord they will just use trade chat. Man why are you so salty?
---
Hardly anyone is going to want anything from Strat Live besides orbs after 3 weeks at 60, so tanks don't get to reserve shit.
---
Warrior leveling is better than both paladin and rogue. At least you can hamstring kite, while rogues have to face tank everything while wearing leather and no shield, and paladins basically auto attack their way to lvl 60.
---
I’m not talking about rank 13 I’m talking about rank 7 and 8
---
Yes, but it's still aids. It's slow, if you aggro too much you die, just aids. Leveling any class in classic is Aids, but warriors are horrific
---
is prot aoe farming at all possible since /sit does not trigger abilities in class?
---
The experience. 
---
Wotlk/Cata baby here :(
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BirMIEA1oVI) is the 0/30/21 spec explained by Skarm.  Although personally I would move a couple of points in the Resto tree around.
---
Nah, I'm a warrior main, and I wish paladins were viable and druids had that little bit of extra oomph they'd need to be main tank material.
---
I'd agree, however the classes I played felt great (Rogue, Deathknight and Warrior)
---
Also, all dungeons become obsolete after the 2nd raid teir is out, hell, when people outgear them heavily through raids, M+ is the only thing to immortalise the dungeon throughout an expac.
---
nope never was it that bad, hell ill take retail over fortnight
---
Presumably the hookers are there to change your socks.
---
I am a Night Elf Mohawk
---
I'd like to hit 60 and try raiding.  I quit vanilla at 56 as an undead warrior.
---
You know armor is just a stat right? BiS doesn't really apply here.
---
No, they definitely will not use trade chat. You clearly aren't a Pserver player. The game has evolved. The days of sitting in a city and begging for a tank or healer for your group are over.
---
Instead you queue up in discord and go do whatever you want.
---
if you have a farmer market nearby, buy some chicken bones. It's time consuming but soo worth it. You can make many batches and freeze it. Give it a try, I agree store bought broth is stupid high on sodium and for a decent one, is like $6 and you can make your own for $6 buying bones. 
---
best of luck to you, seems you got your shit in order!
---
I was specifically talking about The Frozen Throne in this case. "TFT" is what everyone who played the game online in North America called it. I figured most people could figure it out from context or at least Google it.
---
good for you. Why do you think this is so unacceptable? People charge gold for all sorts of things in Vanilla. Its an economy. Blizzard sees this as perfectly acceptable. Who are you to make the rules?

there's a huge difference in the product you're paying for, there isn't a real argument here.  
---
if your argument would've been "I disagree with paying extra for collector's edition, because those types of purchases humour the idea of microtransactions" then I would agree, but I'd draw an arbitrary line there, because you're paying at least €60 for the product, game time and some extra shit. I think that's okay and as you said, some people collect this stuff
---
The light is my strength and so is plate armor.
---
I’ll give that a go, thanks friend!
---
I like when the hunter or rogue tries to pull and can’t turn their pets growl off imo
---
no, i'm manly
---
Just saying some of these pieces can be useful when you pvp and raid. Although I guess most premades will steamroll people anyways and don’t need to worry much about their paladins armor type.
---
I didn't say better I said faster. 
---
Rogues are actually decently faster than warriors and have multiple cooldowns they can pop to deal with accidental overpulls, dealing with difficult mobs, and they are very hard to gank. 
---
Sure time to kill each mob might be slower for a rogue but the leveling experience is much faster overall. 
---
Paladins have self heals and oh shit buttons, but are probably only slightly faster than warriors.
---
That's your reputation to tarnish. That's pretty shameful behaviour.
---
How much worse is this actually compared to a cloth build?
---
I've never played a rogue on private servers and I remember it. But it could have been from later expansions too. 
---
They have a working vanilla client from back then. It shouldn't be hard for them to test if that's how it worked back then. I'm not too worried.
---
False. They were an April fool's joke before the release of RoC, but once they were put in TFT they were canon.
---
No one tell him what bacon bits are made out of!
---
Just out of curiosity, why do you want to speed level to 60?
---
You only have two stable slots in classic and that's enough for one pet with pve resistances, one pet with pvp resistances, and one pet that you're training. (Stable slot increase would be my absolute first choice if Blizzard does OSRS style patch votes.)
---
&gt; Who are you to make the rules?
---
Just the guy that can enforce his will onto others. Like The Blacklist addon that will prevent streamers from ever joining our realm.
---
Big bag of chips and coke. That's it.
---
I want those grenades again.
---
I played on p servers. You constantly see someone in chat forming a group for strat live with orbs reserved. And the groups fill instantly. Sure I could go discord instead but I dont need to. So, really, your opinion is irrelevant.
---
It is monetized, you have to have a wow subscription.
---
I've got a Traeger Grill and plan to use it heavily during launch. I just need to stock up on stuff to put inside it before hand. It's painfully easy to use and little to no effort required to cook with. The hands on time to cook is extremely low. There is two steps required in order to cook with it. 
---
Step 1:Throw stuff inside it and let it smoke for a few hours without having to watch it.
---
Step 2: Pull the stuff off whenever and its dinner time. 
---
I'll be cooking delicious and healthy meals while cramming as much game time in as humanly possible.
---
I don't have the same metabolism to relive the pizza and ramen days... I'll pass lol
---
I'm starting to think most of what I'm remembering is TBC.. I remember like 5 or 6 slots in the stables. Damn. Thanks.
---
I don’t play a warrior, and warriors ain’t everything. Their dps is not always better than mage, only if the warrior is good. Also they get destroyed in world pvp. A warrior running around alone is pretty much free honor.

Yeah it’s really hard to tell. The other aspect of difficulty was the talents we were using Back in the original vanilla since classes got reworked at all different times.
---
Ok, that is a bit different than the up front cost dual spec that most are speaking to.
---
That being said, asking Blizzard to implement saved talent tree templates seems like a great waste of effort, and not at all consistent with the goal of the project.
---
No, there are always new players who just hit 60 wanting to get the quest done, or get their food tome for their alt mage. This is why tanks continue to do this all server long in private servers....
---
Hey they finally got around to meme specs
---
Sure - but MC is pretty much a loot piñata. BWL things get a little more fun and then AQ 40 you gotta start playing correctly.

Thanks man, just what I was looking for! See you on launch :)

---
Umm you need a sub a sub to play...i.e. it already is monetized...
---
It means casuals that fail at tanking or don't know how to tank will spec Prot for tanking.
---
Hell, I know what I'm doing for the most part and I just prefer to spec Prot once I hit 60.
---
Feedback: there is a 2h weapon Fury spec. especially on Horde side with WF totem it's superior to dual wield.
---
then there is also 2h fury slam spec for both factions
---
so it all makes sense

Omg lol

gonna have to look for this now lol

Sword Rogue BiS still needs to be corrected for Humans. The +sword skill swords are NOT BiS for them.

Epic flight form Druid in TBC with herbalism / alchemy &amp; flask spec. I owned the Flask of Relentless Assault market on my server(and a few other rare ones), and also the Fel Lotus market. 
---
I could gather the herb node without getting out of flight form, and if I aggro’d an npc I just smacked the space bar to get elevation, instantly lose aggro, and wait the 10 seconds for it to pat away. I could sweep entire zones and hit every node with Gathermate add on. 
---
I even knew the top guilds’ raid times and would post auctions / buyout others and repost accordingly.
---
I still have the MP3 of this on my phone.
---
Tanking Naxx.
---
My guild doesn't care at all about our reputation. We plan to be assholes. We're The Blacklist authors.
---
Gonna play dagger rogue instead of fury warrior and actually enjoy life. Fury is the best and most fun to play but it is the least rewarding class to play when it comes to farming gold and getting raid loot. Always super painful to play fury warrior =[
---
I’d like to complete the dungeon set. Doing the high level 5-man dungeons was the end-game for me and I only hit 60 a couple of months before BC. I got about 3 pieces on my mage before BC rolled by so it feels like a logical goal for Classic.
---
5g
---
I believe it depends on your weapon. Slower 2H = Seal of Command. Faster wep = Seal of Judgement.
---
My Rule will be, I use Cloth/Leather on Items you can't see (Pants, Bracers, Belt maybe even Gloves). But before I wear the Robes of the Exalted I'd rather delete my Pally!
---
Orc female, the bow animations are good and looks good in Hunter armor sets
---
Some dude in an Indian accent will yell more dots and then tell you minus 50 DKP if you fuck up!
---
Less downtime means foods that can be eaten quickly too. Having mountain of snacks next to you must be the most efficient thing. You can just eat between weapon swings and not waste any time.
---
He's really hard to get, but the 1.2-speed mountain lions in Hillsbrad are almost as good.
---
Now I understand why BIS lists are normally 80-90% leather and cloth.  Most of those items suck so hard, either no healing, extremely low values, or spirit instead of mp5 or no crit. Many of them have strength and useless stats.
---
Thanks for the hard work though, playing full cloth as a paladin in pvp sucks, so this list has its uses for sure.

I think the early level 60 gear "progression" is probably the biggest reason why I wouldn't suggest this.  I played feral druid tank in TBC and loved it, but in vanilla almost all the druid gear is healing focused, so you will be trying for individual pieces to try and gear up appropriately, and I honestly think that alone will make for very unenjoyable experience as 5 man groups work on the tier 0 dungeon sets and easily find upgrades, it will likely be a frustrating experience.  One of the largest components of vanilla/classic is the amount of time things take compared to retail, and that can be exacerbated when your list of potential upgrades is so much smaller.
---
Warriors are not slower to level than rogues and pallies. If you use heals and oh shit buttons you're gonna be sitting to drink. Shit you can barely spam judgment and refresh seals without going oom as a ret pally leveling up. This is essentially the same thing as having to eat as a warrior, except warriors have the luxury of kiting mobs. It's not worth it as a rogue since the swing timer isn't long enough, and paladins have no way to kite kill mobs at all. Rogues end up having to eat all the damn time as well, except they need to heal dmg they took while tanking in leather gear, and Paladins end up using pretty much just autos and the occasional judgment or they have to drink every couple mobs.
---
[This is the HotW spec everyone is talking about.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZtgMscMzxVxsoxo)
---
Key Points: 
---
- Heart of the Wild at the bottom of the feral tree is the namesake talent, and extremely important for this build. Extra int for healing, extra stam for tanking, makes you a happy druid. 
---
- Nature's Swiftness at the bottom of the resto tree is very important for both dungeon healing and pvp.
---
Free Points: The point in feral aggression and the point in improved enrage are just there to hit minimum pre-requisites, you can put them wherever you want.
---
This build can tank all the way up to raid-tier content, and can heal in 5mans extremely well. Not advisable to heal raids with. Also it's damage in cat form is abysmal. Makes a decent flagrunning spec, although many will rework points into nature's grasp.
---
guess it's me - deli sandwhiches always puts me to sleep
---
That would be a PvP set. Not a pre raid BiS list tho. You can us the AV offhand to heal on a paladin. I wouldn't even dream of using it in any PvP fights.
---
man fuck streamers for doing all this entertaining shit
---
Cosmetic shop is still bad. When you see a good mount , you need to be surprised about the guy's incredible luck or determination (i.e winterspring). Not think : oh he dropped 25$ k.
---
Sorry wrote that wrong, Yea I think you have some solid reasoning for picking up repentance. Will probably pick that up over DF
---
everything
---
Warriors are so gear dependent. If you want to consistently top the charts, prepare to put a lot of time into it. For me personally, id rather not and be happy doing pretty dang good dps as any other class without the time commitment and repair bills. Topping the charts isn't that important as long as you're not being a lazy person who stands in fire
---
Balance was at the absolute worst in Vanilla.  That's just a fact.
---
Definitely still worth doing. 50 rep per 20 runecloth I believe.
---
Yea and then people will realise that your "Blacklist" is biased and bullshit and stop using the addon. You are so delusional it's insane. You think many people are going to use your addon that you go around threatening people with. Fuck it's hilarious that you think you have this power. Go away.
---
What spec did you run before the revamp of the talent tree. Warrior dps were useless up until the patch.
---
WoW already has recurring monetization in the form of a 15usd a month sub. The micro transactions aren't even that bad in retail, mainly being character services and cosmetics. You don't have anything to worry about because WoW is already monetized. In retail they could get away with this, because firstly people asked and want those character services and secondly cosmetic stuff was included slowly. The only thing I can see happening is character services, and it likely depends on how the community feels about them.
---
Be hard before level 10 at Classic launch. Simply because the biggest problem up to level 10, and a little after, is going to be finding stuff to kill.
---
Yes it was, yet here you are wanting to play classic, they aren't going to rebalance classic just because it was not very well balanced.
---
The issue is you, don't get the instant strike that fury and, arms have. No MS or BT, is a deal killer.
---
Fury dps is top tier in every single raid and you really only need preraid bis to put out chart topping numbers.
---
You're right that war dps brings nothing but damage, but they bring the best damage. Often times by a decent margin.
---
And as far as gear competition goes you're only competing with sword rogues for weps (assuming you're not orc) and off pieces. Fury warriors actually have less gear competition than pretty much every other spec. A good chunk of furys end game bis isnt even from raids (ironfoe, felstriker, BS items) so I really dont understand that point.
---
That said it's a grind in a half to get to max level + prebis and you'll hit like a wet noodle until that point.
---
Appoint Asians as class leads, they take that shit damned seriously and lotta Americans horse around but listen to them
---
You’re right. We should probably also make sure to give Horde access to paladins to balance the factions. Also every class should have the same utility to really balances the classes.
---
You can’t have both flavor and perfect balance. Personally I choose flavor. That’s why I want classic. If you have to be absolute top of the charts melee dps then roll warrior. If you want to play rogue because you like them then find a guild that will let you raid with your rogue. Vanilla raids aren’t that hard, I’m sure you’ll be able to find plenty.
---
Or just play retail if class balance is that important to you.
---
Yeah basically magical spells are full on resists if they miss.
---
Then if they hit, there's still the chance they resist partially based on the debuffs &amp; spell penetration.
---
So... Yeah we have a lot of things to watch for with gear.
---
&gt; Doesn't have to be justified
---
I have a phd in bullshit, so let me reiterate this for you fine folks.   
---
I know it's terrible, and I don't have a reasonable explanation as to why it's so bad, so I am going to gaslight.
---
I'm going to treat myself and celebrate the launch by buying a pack of regular, good ole RedBull. I'm not big on energy drinks at all, but I like the taste of some. I never buy RedBull because, well, it's the most expensive. Also I'm only going to drink one of them for the first 4 days, so don't worry about that. Afterwards I will transition to *-BOOMER INTESIFIES-* Monster Ultra Zero *-BOOMER SUBSIDES-*.
---
I usually make a nice cup of ghetto mocha in the morning, with a small breakfast that can be taken in front of the PC. Maybe cereal, muesli or some croissants.
---
Might skip lunch altogether because it simply wont be needed.
---
Dinner will be primarily pasta dishes, recipes ready in under 30 minutes or so. I wish the frozen dishes they sell at supermarkets here in my country were good enough quality to be eaten, but sadly, they are not. Otherwise I would probably buy a lot of frozen foods. I can still taste that Chicken Tikka Masala from the Iceland brand of frozen foods in the UK. That thing was absolute god tier, especially if you garnish it wish freshly made Basmati rice.
---
Also, minimum of 3 liters of water a day, that's roughly one big-boi bottle for yous folks across the pond.
---
Just tell me, what in the prot tree do you think is a "safety net"?
---
Hot Ones has that effect.
---
Technically there were some videos...
---
Are you going to do PvP?
---
Nah.  They switch off spamming a macro while fighting for first to engage on quest mobs, while I enjoy the other.  During long flights both come enjoy some booty bay portion of coke island.
---
Oh I know, I'm usually the tank in this scenario and I will simply stand there until the DPS dies or the healer that's to nice for his own good throws out a heal and gets aggro.
---
Funny thing though about any situation where the DPS pulls trying to make the run go faster, in Vanilla that always has the opposite effect of more down time spent healing getting mana and healing again to top everyone off and then needing mana still.
---
There was only 2 slots in TBC also
---
I would like to second what StarWoundedEmpire said about swapping out gear for raiding. I plan to do most of my solo stuff in the gear that I personally like--numbers be damned (to a degree). When I step in a raid or do anything with a group, I want to be as optimal as I can be, regardless of what my character looks like. There's more plate in later tiers, regardless, so it's something to look forward to!
---
See someone in a guild, ask them if you can join. Repeat until in a guild.
---
How am I pretending when I've literally admitted I'm not several times and clarified where I'm getting my info from?
---
Nice strawman.
---
is she not throwing her friends into Blackrock mountain? not Ragefire Chasm
---
I'm pretty sure I was able to do this through TBC...
---
Hey man! Thx for the tips I have one question with Luna unit frame in particular. I'm using it on a pserver and it does the job for healing but I hate the fact that my target icons don't show the specific portrait for elite (like the dragon around the portrait) is there any ways to get it back? (same thing with rare icons)
---
What about Steam's software? It works for most games, Steam or not
---
[Found this image of all the dungeon sets](https://i.imgur.com/6d3toxy.jpg). Y'know, for science.
---
I suggest listing alternative shoulders. The dawnbringer shoulders pattern has a very, very low drop rate from Rag, Azuregos &amp; Onyxia in Phase 1. It'll only be relevant for people coming in late to the raid scene.
---
&gt;This time i'm going to focus on one character only

getting battle.net to start up was an issue for a while, now it crashed when i try to run WoW. Ubuntu 18 here.

It's because we punch a guy in the face for a class quest.

It's just impossible to know what actual interactions were in vanilla because so much is undocumented or intentionally obfuscated.  The inability of WF hits to trigger other procs may have been a private server bug.
---
Blizzard, please. I want this.
---
Combo points were lost, but you'd still have about a quarter to half a second after the mob died to pop off SnD.

Remember this is the same company that hyped up the big new diablo announcement to a crowd of diehard PC players and were somehow surprised at the response they got.
---
I want to agree, but that helm doesn’t compare to Judgment.
---
Activision never had the data. Acti-Blizz had and will have the data. The information available to the public is not the same as the data available to internal staff. Do you really think they don't have data on how many people are playing on each server? Each region? Each version? Its as a simple as adding up the number of players on each server on each region on each version. The data will exist and marketing will see it.
---
&gt; Why haven't you managed to stop tanks from selling runs on private servers then Mr. Tough Guy?
---
1. We started playing on our own PServer.
---
2. We don't care if scrubs pay for runs.
---
We're going to own whatever realm we end up choosing.
---
It's playablish. I do wish they'd make the dispels on shield slam 100%, that would go a long way towards increasing prot's pve effectiveness. Last Stand can make for some clutch flag runs, CB is good, so is imp shield bash for the silence, but on the whole you're just less effective than an MS warrior.
---
Honestly, when it comes to premades, I'd argue fury isn't even viable either (yes I watched the Swifty vids). Healing reduction is the single most important skill in structured group fights and MS is one of the few and the best source of healing reduction. You're not taking down a druid FC without MS.
---
Nice strawman. 
---
I mean, go play a different game if you hate the balancing. It doesn’t have to be justified because that’s just the game. They’re trying to recreate vanilla.

I totally get the 8 hour sleep groggy/bad attitude. For me it's more than 6hrs is bad. I am actually functional at 4-5 hours of sleep but it's not physically healthy tho. I am used to it, since it's been a part of my lifestyle since little. I aim for 6 but body just wakes up in 4-5 hours. 
---
Since I won't be biking during this 10 day breaks for myself, I am replacing it with at home workouts during downtime in-game. Push up, pull up bar, sit ups, I own dumbbells and resistance bands also, might as well use em after I finish dusting them off. No GF atm, so filthy speedleveling it is lol.
---
I think that you are going a bit overboard here, since class design and balance philosophy was entirely different when WoW was originally developed. Blizzard wanted players to feel like they were living as the class they played, so the factors for balance included leveling, pvp, day-to-day activities, dungeons, raids, etc. Each class's ability to perform in each of these areas was balanced so that excelling in one or more areas meant lagging behind in others. Being bad at some things makes classes feel unique. 
---
Contrast that to the way Blizzard went in WotLK and going forward, where the factors were more or less the same, but each class needed to be viable in every category. Rather than balance classes against one another, holistically, each class began being balanced against each other class in *every facet of gameplay*. The game started flattening out and classes lost some of their identities. 
---
So if you think that raid DPS, healing, and tanking are all that matters in class balance, then yeah it's awful. If you consider the other 75% or more of the game, then I'd say the guy in charge of class balance did a fine job preventing every class from being interchangeable.
---
The whole game.
---
isnt there a viable 2h slam spec on alliance?
---
Right? I don’t understand this line of thinking at all. These are the kind of people that complain about specs being viable but then only consider viable to be the singularly absolute BiS. 
---
If class balance is that important go play retail where they’re basically all the same anyway.

Probably the least impressive thing you can care about among wow versions, since skill takes a back seat to gear and class tuning.

And yet there will still be literally thousands of people who will do nothing but play, eat, shit, and sleep for weeks to have higher meters.. in a 15 year old game with static content

What's more realistic than that though?  You can feel the inequity, just like in real life.

Folks would start to migrate back to the private servers if ActiBlizzard fails to be true to Vanilla.
---
Funny you bring up Skarm Tank considering he's one of the content creators I've been watching religiously. He outright states Pservers are easier than Vanilla many times and even has an entire video discussion about it.
---
Good. I'm glad you will be so straight-up about it. That means people will know immediately, not to have anything to do with you. Hope your guild doesn't blow up ;)

Regardless, its evident that you're no one to take advice from.

You actually think you can control the server with your little black list addon lol what a joke. You are delusional. What a sad sad life. "Just the guy who can enforce his will onto others". In a video game. God dude. Go outside you filthy neck beard.
---
Well, damn.
---
There will be some guilds who don't care about having a moonkin or feral and let you join the groups. But most of all guilds will give you the raidspot only for playing resto.
---
If you should play pvp, feral is extremely strong and a moonkin can shine aswell! But gearing your moonkin is tough - even if they let you raid, you would have to roll for every item, mages, warlocks etc want aswell.
---
You are the Christian Bale of cosplay.

A very small proportion of any games population uses forums. There will be way more people than 144k playing. Also, if 144k were only 1% of woes population that would mean 14 million subs, which is higher than its ever been.

Oh yeah completely agree, but it seemed from the beta like this was a blanked dungeon elites thing.  I mean you had some dungeon elites in SFK doing less damage than their non-elite counterparts outside the dungeon for fucks sake - there's no way this is what it was like a launch.
---
The price if WoW monthly sub hasn't gone up in a very long time. Meanwhile the price of everything else goes up (salaries, hardware cost, maintenance). Without the in-game store, we'd be paying 20 dollars a month sub and 25 per token, if not more. This would have killed the game quicker than anything, because competitors would find ways to stay at 15 a month.
---
So the in game store is a service I can avoid paying into. Let someone else float the tab, so that I can keep paying this price.
---
As far as visual prestige goes, sure. But there's so many pets and mounts in the game now available without paying extra that I can find my own prestige too.

That's like saying.

Lets be real, with 2019 tech like hamstring kiting and spell batch enrage proccing, all of the complaints that they level slowly are pretty much irelevant. You kite like a bitch until you hit 30, then you're an unstopable god king. 
---
Warrior leveling only sucks if you're below 30. At this point I dont know why the myth that warriors are bad at leveling still holds. Sure, others are better, but warriors are goddamn fuck machines for more than 60% of the leveling experience. IIRC level 42 is half way to 60. 
---
They don't need unique farming areas, and their AoE is good enough to farm a few high profile spots if you have a shield spike. They're not the best in the game, but putting a shield spike is really all you need for Fury to farm like a champ. 
---
They have nearly endless combat utility. AoE fear, out of combat stun+mobility, in combat stun+mobility, on demand slow, multiple personal fear immunities, AoE taunt, taunt, while having the most robust damage and tanking kits. Warrior is one of the only classes that has multiple single target and AoE spells, letting them adapt to combat situations the other classes cant. Warriors have more combat utility than any class, it's the reason they're the best tanks.

I bring him up because you brought him up in one breath, and in another claim   
---
" Tanks tanking Naxx and AQ 40 as dual weilding Fury Warriors are all the proof you need of that. " Skarm would never say that.
---
Yeah, it’s ruins the congruency of the world. Everything you see should be achieve inside the game world not a pop up window and a credit card.
---
I suppose their is still some AoE tanking, just not as easy.  
---
With upgraded Ret aura in the Retribution tree, tanking gear and Consecrate you can take on a lot of enemies at once, but it's not nearly as good as reckoning.
---
I don't mind that reck-bombs won't be a thing, reckoning will still be in the game and it will function as intended; to give you an extra attack if you are crit. Because you can't force crits, you have to avoid raising your defence stat with the talent points, but it \*can\* work as a Ret/Reck hybrid.

You can level holy priest just fine. Just take some smite talents, the talent that allows you to cast without pushback and put 5 points into shadow for the mana recovery. Smite priests actually level quite well.

&gt;Warriors cannot sit spam in classic
---
Somebody isn't following the beta. The private server version of the bug isnt in the game because it was never in vanilla. The original bug, which was recreated in classic, involves spell batching the hit, so you're standing when recieving the crit. you CAN sitstand proc enrage.
---
lol, good point.
---
If you wanna max your launch day gameplay, then eat a ton of high carb meals on the day before launch and the morning of launch. Then eat sparingly with moderate fasting + protein only based meals. Drink plenty water and have a little salt when youre tired but only a little and mix it with water and then periodically walk around away from the pc to wake yourself up
---
Huhuran? :p

---
When it comes to PVE, being full plate or having massive survivability gear is beyond useless before Naxx. In naxx you can argue never being in danger the full raidnight might be prefered, but even then tier3 is on such a good level you'll be in almost full plate anyway asap.
---
With shield I agree, makes you survive any random trash hit/player error in naxx/AQ and even MC trash. Rest of your gear however is mostly pointless as the shield gives you enough survivability in raids anyway.
---
Paladin is about sustain on the tanks making it easy for other classes to build their healing on, thus, being full plate and adding nothing to survivability beyond shield means you instead decrease the same tankhealing output you talk about for no reason whatsoever.
---
Why would you lvl a horde char for that, you can get deviate fish as alliance
---
Well... thanks for making me want to roll a warrior again :P
---
Nope I remember taurens having a larger hitbox.
---
I started vanilla with a  rogue, it was my favorite class in Everquest but I could not get into it, I ended up quitting at 33 and didn't come back to BC. I'm going Shammy for Classic.
---
You pick the worse class at something and proceed to own all the cookie cutter kids that hate their class.
---
There was no design philosophy.  They were flying by the seat of their pants just pulling shit out of their ass.
---
Me: I think X, but unfortunately, I have no evidence or proof.
---
You: But you have no proof or evidence therefore you are wrong!
---
Me: ...
---
Just know, as a shaman, you will be expected to only heal if you plan on doing pug raids. Rogue, mage, hunter, and warrior are very popular classes and raids will have no problem filling dps.
---
Yes. The Park is a like a little mix of Teldrassil and Stormwind. Blizzard sure loves destroying Night Elf stuff.
---
Back in WoD at the start of that Expansion the Brawler guild potions weren't soulbound. They had the same icon and the same name as regular Str, Agi and Int Draenic potions with the exception of saying "Brawlers" at the start of the name. All you had to do was walk into the Brawlers guild, buy a few hundred and post them on the AH. People searching for the potions they wanted would see these potions come up as well unless they opted for the "Exact Match" option and put in the name of the potion they wanted.
---
I don't remember how much they sold for when this happened but I made a nice chunk of change by sneaking in a few stacks of each at a time. This only last for a few days before I made a nice profit, the Brawlers potions became soulbound and I got a decent amount of hate mail.

Thanks for you work and taking feedback OP. Love the site so far. Do you think it would be possible to create a “shopping list” with the items split into dungeons and bosses. That way you quickly know which dungeon to prio.
---
If you like spamming, mage is for you.  basically just frostbolt over and over again.  Frost mage is also really fun for AOE farming once you get some of the synergistic talents in place.  freeze everything with frost nova, then huge guranteed crits

This is patch 1.12 and is the oldest video I could find of SM clear. We have absolutely 0 evidence to support that damage was ever higher. Some people say they remember it being harder but memory isn't reliable, especially after 15 years. You MAY be remembering it being harder due to talent changes over time.
---
Yes but you have a better chance of them having a Mail or Plate piece in that slot vs a Leather/Cloth healer.
---
&gt; What epics are you talking about? The headless horseman stuff wasn't in vanilla.
---
Glad to hear it if that's the case. Was mainly referring to those rings and I believe a helmet? If they didn't exist in vanilla that's good.
---
Perhaps, I'm just sharing my experience and the philosophy shared by my guild back in vanilla. For them a pally was less about raw healing output because you are spamming and overhealing the tank anyhow.  If the main tank dies you wipe, but on the same hand if his healers die we wipe. Again differ philosophy, and a very vanilla pre-pserver one.
---
this,
---
Guild have preferred raid compositions but the issue is that its hard to fill all 40 slots and then if you do you have 5 people that no show and you take what you can get
---
Just get a cat, whatever benefits any other pet has is completely trumped by the fast attack speed (spell pushback), claw, and extra damage.
---
It also has dash and stealth. Cats are just the 10-60 pet (and I hate it).
---
How so? for the non-meme specs is very accurate
---
I mean I literally said that there's no evidence in my initial post...
---
I mean there's a damn good reason they're the best class in the game. I'm still on the fence on if i want to play competitively or casually, if i play for serious, it's warrior all the fucking way. You have higher impact on group content on warrior than you do on any other class in the game.
---
Human tank warrior:
---
- S3 weapon Spineshatter (BWL)
---
- S4 weapon CTS (BWL)
---
- DFT ( BWL) not listed for S3, S4, but suddenly for S5, S6
---
Something seems weird still, idk.
---
To be fair, I’ll be wearing a damn light blue dress for raid healing so I can’t make fun of anyone for the aesthetics of their gear :p
---
There’s usually not many high lvl horde in the barrens
---
Prot pally is weird. It's not good as a raid tank, but pretty good at dungeon tanking. But if you dungeon tank, you don't want to gear like a warrior. You want stam/int/spelldamage
---
Well after a while of playing. The rotation gets mundane and I can generally auto pilot most of the quests and mob killing. Having a beer or few will make the rotation a bit more exciting. I can laugh and get carried away at stupid shit
---
If you're DW Fury Tanking Nef, AQ or Naxx you have it on farm. Skarm has said that multiple times.
---
You only dw tank to give your DPS more leeway to let loose. That's usually because the raid is geared enough to pull that off
---
Before the wow cash shop people where buying mounts and boosts on eBay.
---
While I oppose these services ,I acknowledge that thier has always been high demand for them.
---
I will actually focus talent point in one tree instead of just spreading them randomly if the 3 of them
---
The deviate farming is something I use pre 40. After 40 and at even 60, there are alot more effecient farming tacs

just play a non-meme spec and you'll be fine

---
Those Holly Paladins are really beautiful around Christmas time.
---
&gt;  As such you will never be a favored DPS choice in 5 man's. 
---
 For 5 mans everyone rolling warrior should realize that they will be tanking pretty much every time they join a group. Whoever is tanking, unless they are a druid of course, is not going to want to invite a dps:er who will need on their gear while contributing so little compared to other dps classes. 
---
Basically a dps warrior doesn't exist until endgame 60. Of course if you are not pug:ing it's a different thing. Playing with friends you can make anything work. A pug however is not going to want a dps warrior.
---
Yeah, back in Vanilla one of the ways people got into Old Outland before it was removed from the map was by standing on the mast of the boat at Booty Bay and having a warlock duel and fear them. The player getting feared would run off the edge of the mast and fear’s speed increase would bug out, causing the character to run at 500% speed, crossing the western edge of EK’s ocean and not stopping until they hit the landmass of Old Outland.
---
they said they planened 3 to 9 layers per server.
---
Damn, that's a long 2-3 weeks that ion said they were aiming for
---
As a mage it would be much faster to do it after you reach 60. You can solo farm instances a lot faster. So level up enough so you can craft your wands, then focus on first aid and save the left over scraps.
---

They will have an easier time in Prot vs Fury though.
---
 If you disagree with this then you're basically saying Prot doesn't = less DMG received than Fury. 
---
The safety net being YOU TAKE LESS DMG OVERALL in Prot than you do in Fury. If you didn't then why the fuck is Prot even a thing?
---
Reddit Subs =/= total interest in a game.

The game isn't even out yet. Wow retail probably doesnt even have 1 milion subscribers but the subreddit has over 1 million.

The New York Yankees have 37 000 reddit subs. I'm pretty sure they have a few more than 37 000 fans.

&gt;Plate and a shield allows a pally to stay alive longer from melee attacks

If you're getting hit by bosses or any physical attacks/abilities from bosses in a raid, you're doing it wrong.
---
Shadow priest? Hell no
---
I bring that up because you make statements like " You couldn't 2h tank SM lib with the whole group being level 30 and not using CC. This is what people were doing with no effort on classic beta when the cap was 30. " You try to discredit the beta client based off your memory and that is something that bears repeating. You have no ground to stand on to make statements like this.
---
it's my thing. I've done the 1-60 journey many times and this time, I am focus on speed leveling. Hitting 60 early has a lot of benefits down the road, being rich is one of those potentials. Because eventually it will become harder for me to put time to grind for shit when AQ/Naxx comes out.
---
The quicker I can get rich, saves me time on consumables. the quicker I can hit 60, I can grind mats for consumables later down the time. The cheaper mats will be early before becoming expensives down the line.
---
I will eventually have 20-25 hours a week gameplay later in the year, so focus doing everything now before becoming a casual. Cause those 20-25 will be raid times most likely and not enough world time. I don't want to spend 20-25 hours grinding consumables or other crap for raid when I can enjoy those 20-25 for wPvP, getting to R10 or whatever. Getting an early lead and early gold to buy stuff for future plans is important. 
---
The early speed levelers will have an advantage in controlling the AH as well. We have the means to gold farm and market manipulate the AH while everyone is still in their 30s, selling greys, us 60s are selling greens to NPC for 1-5g each quickly and buying out stuff from AH.
---
I never once said PServers are easier than Classic. Not once.
---
In fact I pointed out that Classic may be easier.
---
I said PServers are easier than Vanilla, which they are according to what I've read/seen from top tanks.
---
Elemental resistance and hit chance are 2 different things. FYI Resistance doesn't affect hit chance, it just reduces damage on a hit.

The New York Yankees only have 37 k reddit subs.

They will be selling the team any day now, can't even fill the stadium if EVERY fan showed up

Gonna make some chicken noodle soup and freeze it so i have low prep time food that doesn't spoil. It's literally just open bag put on stove and wait, easily done on a FP.

Gonna make a big bowl of chili for launch(without chili though.. and low on beans for obvious reasons). 
---
Have some premade sandwiches made for quick snacks
---
Might look into some bars or smth
---
I’m gonna stick to one character only and I am going to play alliance instead of Horde as I’ve been Horde only for 90% of my wow career. I also only care about PVE so I won’t be on a gank server and I have no desire to go into battlegrounds.
---
Honestly I just want to enjoy the adventure to 60 I’m not gonna rush, as I will still be raiding on retail with my  current guild. I do want to raid classic and experience everything especially AQ 40 which I missed as I was burnt out on WoW at the time and didn’t come back till shortly before BC launched. I deeply regret for not playing classic for as long as I should have but I was in my 20s just graduating college at the time and had real life responsibilities and goals I was chasing. Now that I am in my mid 30s married no kids and life has slowed down I will have time to revisit classic and do things I missed due to time constraints.

"WaRrIoR DoNt Do GuD dAmAgE" - Pepega

&gt;I think that you are going a bit overboard here, since class design and balance philosophy was entirely different when WoW was originally developed. Blizzard wanted players to feel like they were living as the class they played, so the factors for balance included leveling, pvp, day-to-day activities, dungeons, raids, etc. Each class's ability to perform in each of these areas was balanced so that excelling in one or more areas meant lagging behind in others. Being bad at some things makes classes feel unique.
---
All of this is applicable in TBC where classes are actually balanced. You bring ret, fury, and arms all for very different reasons because between the classes and specs, there's uniqueness, player identity, and areas you do well and poorly at. The difference between classic and TBC is that you can bring rets and arms in TBC without gimmicks. TBC's system takes everything classic did well and makes it better.
---
Gametime for gold will be introduced extremely quickly (and yes, sellable in the AH, that's the point), to retain the boosting status quo of retail, which is their main money maker.
---
So, not very long. People whine about Diablo mobile but don't even realise BFA is already a mobile game, retail has been since the mythic+ boost + selling gametime for gold combination (they are 100% linked to make money).
---
So to kill the time I've resubbed to retail, after a few days at max level I've already seen the mythic+ 5mans are only in the game _because_ people are massively buying/selling 'boosts' for it, for which people buy the 30day gametime, to put on the auction house, to get the gold to buy said boost.
---
It's 100% like a mobile game, shoehorning everyone into mythics, which a lot of rich casuals are either cba/too shit skilled for, which causes them to buy.
---
All I see in bfa is these systems, there's literally no way a company that has turned retail into basically a mobile game will give this up if people massively move over to classic. 
---
If these boosting companies make a succesful transition to classic (which while harder, I can still see WTS ZG idol boosts etc being spammed in worldchat soon sadly) then the first thing to follow is the gametime-to-sell-on-AH-for-gold.
---
It is and if your guild stacks warriors and rogues it makes it difficult to get dw weapons so having a 2h fury or two while you wait for drops is good for the guild.  Also you get your PvP weapon first :)
---
Used (k)Ubuntu 18 and played WoW without issue through Lutris at the start of the expansion.
---
Fair enough. Remember I'm working off a 15 year ago vanilla, not pserver memory. I'm sure those who have played on pservers since then have worked out what works better
---
Yeah, it's basically one less point on 2h spec in arms, drop imp execute and 2 more points in fury and spec 5/5 slam. You need a swing timer and you rage dump slams only directly after a swing lands, as it resets your swing timer. It can still do decent, but it's obviously a lot more difficult than spamming hammys. The benefit is you'll never be threat capped with pally buffs.
---
Removing some def items when def cap is reached, that's all
---
Yeah but maybe you just didn’t try hard enough.
---
Prebis means The best item in the slot before raids. 
---
Best in slot means best item currently possible to equip.
---
I heard Ron Howard.
---
You evil madman
---
I was just looking at the meme shaman specs, so that might explain it.
---
omg, another beef jerky + energy drink person!!!! dude, I get weird looks when this is my go to for boost. I AM NOT ALONE!
---
Yah I’m not taking off work for wow that’s cringe
---
yeah just r/psmf ita for quick weightloss while still working out and keeping your gains. works decently well in sparing muscles, but its obviously better with trt
---
If classic does well maybe they will make the main game better. Which means monetization will never go away
---
To piggy back off of this. Alliance have a bit more of a difficult time meeting up in the same zone. Dwarfs/Gnomes going to Stormwind via Deeprun Tram in Tinker Town inside of Ironforge. It will drop you inside the dwarven district of Stormwind which you can walk out move over to Goldshire or Northshire Abby. Reverse that if you are a human wanting to go to Dwarven/Gnome starting zone. 
---
For Night Elves... well its a bit of a journey. You have to run from your spawning location and run to Darnassus. There is a portal (shiny purple tree behind super badass Bear-Tree Bank) that teleports you to the Docks below. You take that boat to Darkshore, and take another boat to Menethil Harbor in The Wetlands (a zone with creatures 20 levels higher than you [Prepare to Die]) After you follow the road heading East you turn south and make your way into the hills to enter the tunnel to take you in to Dun Morogh. 
---
note you are not completely safe yet, there are some orcs that hang out they are about level 20 iirc.
---
Keep following the road and the signs and you should be in safe territory soon. From here on its more like the Dwarven/Gnome journey to Stormwind if you wish, continue to the Tram to get to Elwynn Forrest.
---
Layering let's you stay flexible server to server. Server 1 might get 12k active players at start and settle 4 months later to 8k active. Server 2 might get 8k players and settle to 2k.
---
If all you did was shard lower zones to help with the first 48 hour zerg, but still let 12k pops on all servers, with the intent of no layering, you now have a Server with 8k people four months in and Server 2 with 2k people. Server 1 has too many people, and Server 2 could feel empty to a lot of people.
---
I had a similar journey, and personally I plan to join a guild of casual players this time. I know that will make it easier for me to keep my playtime at a casual level. But that’s because I know I will be perfectly happy playing until max level and then a bit of PvP. If raid dungeons is what did it for you then this is not an option for you, of course.
---
It was on the stress test but yeah lol, I actually like asmongold some, but I enjoy mcconnel breaking breaking his balls more. This clip just looked so fun, WoW BR mode.
---
Yes that is true. Now how does "Tanks tanking Naxx and AQ 40 as dual weilding Fury Warriors are all the proof you need of that." make any sense given what you just said?
---
I R Rogue. Never had that feeling 😉
---
just got done playing.
---
cya nerd
---
If you're casual, then you can play with all plate.  There are plate alternatives to most BiS that are still good, and most people won't care as long as you aren't a drag on raid performance.  A few suboptimal pieces as a healer won't make much difference at all.
---
Pserver or vanilla?
---
Well since you literally are sitting doing very little all you need is enough to power your arms and brain so like 1500 calories a day should cover it xD
---
Play a Warrior tank, start a guild, get Thunderfury. Will see if I can even manage to get a guild together....
---
cool story bro, this post isnt for you, move along now casual
---
She said she never faked one, so I’m sure she’s happy to let you know when she’s left unsatisfied.
---
&gt; I know people say it will never happen 
---
Yes, you are right. It will never happen.
---
There are way to many powerful reasons against Classic monetization...and all those reasons are not because players, but because Blizzard-Activision. They will choose NOT to monetize Classic.
---
First, there will be 2 WoW running, Retail and Classic. Retail monetization works because Retail player base wants useless cap, like mounts, pets, t-mogs, insta-leveling, character race/gender change, etc.
---
If you already have a game that is DESIGNED towards monetization...no matter how successful Classic is, the risk of losing MORE than gaining is sky high. The FIRST attempt at monetizing Classic will lead to a MASSIVE dropout in the player base...and Retail players WILL NOT play Classic because cash shop.
---
So, to monetize Classic, Blizzard-Activision must change it ENTIRELY, before implementing a cash shop.
---
The problem is that the WoW player base will be "X" Classic players and "Y" Retail players...moving the player base from an ALREADY monetized game to another is like changing money from one hand to the other. It's stupid. Not to mention that the "X" will instantly go to ZERO if the game is changed, even before a cash shop is implemented.
---
So, Activision-Blizzard will end up with TWO monetized game...but only the "Y" part of the player base. And the "Y" part won't be able and won't be WILLING to spend money on TWO GAMES. And even if some will be willing to , let's say, buy a $25 mount in Retail and another $25 in Classic...those players won't be enough to spend MORE than the loss of MILLIONS (yes, millions) of subscriptions.
---
This is not a matter of "Activision-Blizzard are greedy, hence, they will monetize Classic". This is a matter of "BECAUSE Activision-Blizzard are a greedy bunch of suits, they will NOT lose more money by monetizing Classic".
---
If you are thinking of a LONG term, Chinese drop-like attempt to slowly monetize Classic, starting with something that won't hurt the game...well, the Classic player base is not the Retail players base. We KNOW that the FIRST CASH SHOP offer for Classic means FULL cash shop later. Activision-Blizzard also knows that.
---
There is no way in hell that NO MATTER how Activision-Blizzard is thinking of "fooling" the Classic player base to implement any form of monetization...they won't be able to.
---
First, they have to CHANGE the player base...and this means changing the game into...Retail.
---
But they already have Retail.
---
Cash Shop, if EVER attempted to be implemented in Classic, will instantly lead to ActiBlizz losing tens of millions / month...money that they CANNOT make of a cash shop in Classic.
---
this escalated quickly
---
Just being able to ankh and use totems makes shamans useful. You'll be fine.
---
Rage scaled hard with damage dealt in early vanilla, so once you got an end-game weapon you were pretty much capped on rage at all times and could dump it via Slam or Heroic Strike - at that point they can top DPS charts. Up until then it's kinda rough.
---
I remember DPS rising for poorly-geared warriors and falling for well-geared warriors when Blizzard normalized rage generation. That was probably in like late vanilla, around the time AQ was released? So I'll be interested to see the state of classic and how quickly they catch up to that point.
---
Even being a flag carrier as a prot warrior isn't that good.
---
People can hit you from behind so you can't block/didge/parry, spells aren't reduced in damage beyond defensive stance and you have no reliable way to remove stuns, snares or slows of you're not alliance and/or don't hambe a paladin nearby.
---
Mages and Druids make far better carriers than a prot warrior.
---
I mean you can write this off on your anti-private server bias, but I'm a naxx raiding pserver warrior. We dont need world buffs, we top meters at all gear levels with even only a few consumes. Vanilla was 1.0-1.12, Classic and private servers are 1.12 all the way. Warriors recieved major buffs along the way and 1.12 warrior is superior to every other DPS class. 
---
Even lowballing it and assuming we get nailed by some stealth nerf, warrior will be topping meters. 
---
2006 players were dogshit compared to us today.
---
Again I never said Prot talents provide you with midegation. The midegation you get comes from gearing for midegation and being able to tank well in that gear because your Prot spec.
---
People are reading far to into this ffs. All I did was call out the fact that not EVERY Warrior that hits 60 will be able to Fury tank. How in the fuck is that a controversial fact? It's pretty fucking common sense.
---
Get off my dick. I've admitted I'm not an expert. I'm open to being wrong. Untie me from the fucking flame pillar and move on already.
---
Plate Only is the modifier to that. It is the BIS PLATE gear. How is that hard to understand?
---
Valentine's had candy that improved sp, melee att power, hit, def that you could stock up on.  Either hallows end ore the summer festival had food items that raised stats as quest rewards, can't remember.  Winter had exclusive recipes and pets.
---
None had any gear or mounts though.
---
it's very good for classic, check this out  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaIJY3HdfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaIJY3HdfY)  and this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZj5kNXkiQo&amp;t=53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZj5kNXkiQo&amp;t=53s) . just make sure you have 2 sticks of ram(don't go 1 single stick of 8gb) and try to overclock as much as you can. i expect you to have easily above 60 in raids and perhaps 30-40 in world bosses scenarios where you're 40vs40
---
Estimated by who? Where is this data? I'd like to read it myself, I haven't had a good laugh in a while!
---
it's beta who cares
---
Considering that 2200g integrated gpu performs slightly under GTX 1050 then you should be fine atleast at low settings
---
I mostly want to focus on creating new memories instead of trying to relive old ones. My first reaction to Classic's announcement was 'yay now i can go back to playing a pally, vanilla style!' 
---
But thinking about it over time made me realize how much I didn't experience the first time around, how many new possibilities there are that I want to explore!
---
S3-&gt;S4 the only thing that changes besides the weapon is the cloak, both cloaks have the same +Def. That's not it.
---
this will be your downfall... don't fall into the trap of world chat! next thing you realized, your xp/hr has dropped dramatically and you're arguing with some dumbass about some stupid shit and the nerg catches up to you!
---
I’m not sure if this is an insult or engineering joke
---
Typically in a situation like that involving a BoE everyone involved should just Need.
---
The issue here is that you seem to lack an understanding of prot pally itemization as a whole.
---
Any pally trying to tank using the gear listed is most certainly not going to take much damage because they’re not going to hold threat either because they fail to do enough dmg due to lack of spellpower, or fail to even be able to use spells because they’re out of mana from the lack of int.
---
Check the enchant
---
So this is gonna sound weird but if you are near a Loves gas station, they have the best jerky, super dry and great flavor. I could live on good beef jerky
---
&gt; Your competing for gear/weapons with Tanks, Rogues, Hunters, Paladins, Shaman in various rolls, so you won't see priority that you may hope for gearing with so many individual slot competing parties by roll meaning your overall end game gear is going to come slower than almost every other class/spec.
---
You mean the pre-bis that you can simply reserve or soft-reserve by not inviting Rogues because you're tanking and make your own groups?
---
This whole post is trash honestly
---
I think the joke is that people are used to Shadow being viable in retail.
---
Wait I actually love this
---
Yea, I get it, but if the same happened on retail how would you feel?
---
If you're good and put in the effort, you'll get a spot.
---
1) avoiding unnecessary carbs. 
---
2) carbs makes me sleepy too personally
---
everything else A+
---
I think the priest' BOP lasts the longest (till nef), warlock and I think mage will both replace it with the crafted one from ZG.  Anyway, the only cloth that wouldnt make that chest is actually shadow priest, because truefaith is a healing item.
---
And alliance doesnt play mages?  Thats news to me.
---
This can hurt gph because of less bag space unfortunately. Probably still optimal though. Just have to go back and sell more often.
---
i hope you are right
---
I will be open and honest, if it would have dropped in some temporary open world quest group, then yes I would need it. Guess I am a dick, but honest one :D.
---
I understand it but that doesn't change how stupid and contradicting it is.
---
Buckees my friend :D
---
It will be tough as enhance, they are one of the lowest dps classes and barely buff melee more than a resto shaman. If you go resto though you found be solid.
---
Came here to say this, she was fantastic on Hot Ones!!! Love her!!
---
When the game launches til the AQ patch:
---
1 Rogue
---
2 Warrior
---
3 Mage
---
4 Hunter
---
5 Paladin/Shaman
---
6 Warlock
---
7 Priest
---
8 Druid
---
I'm guessing these will be the numbers for both factions combined, you'll see more Hunters soloing than in raids/dungeons. Rogues and Warriors will be pretty equal. There will be a lot more Warlocks on Hordeside. The difference between the number of Rogues and Priest is probably less than Priests and Druids.
---
The first 3 will have strong numbers throughout the entire game, after BWL Hunters will drop off hard, Warlocks will gain numbers. All healers will take a big hit and resto Druids will be near extinct but offspecs will raise their numbers again by a bit.
---
It was a thing earlier in Vanilla, fairly certain it got patched in 1.10 though.
---
"Slice and Dice - This ability can no longer be blocked, dodged, or parried, and cannot miss. If you attempt to use this ability when your target is dead, you will now receive an error message instead of displaying the spell animations."

---
I feel like this is a very bad idea
---
i never dinged 60 in vanilla, just got to 28. I'll make it this time
---
I hear a sharp ringing sound sometimes, should I get it checked out?
---
Personally, if you equip it, I wouldn’t care an upgrade is an upgrade. But if turned around and sold it on the AH I’d be pissed
---
That’s the joke, brainiac.
---
maybe spriest

It's not an actual Toyota commercial, right?

I'm taking the week off. The weekend before I'll probably prep a couple of things that freeze/reheat well to have for lunches: a batch of breakfast burritos, and a pot of chili, probably. Also, stock up on things like yogurt, apples and salad.
---
My wife will still be working, so I'll probably go ahead and take a break from the game to cook dinner normally on the weekdays.
---
That first weekend of the game, it sounds like the plan will probably be an old school LAN party at my place with a bunch of friends that I'll be playing with. This will likely be a blood bath: I'm planning to brew two kegs of WoW-themed beer that we'll have on tap in the kegerator. It will probably be a "drunken dungeon runs fueled by pizza and doritos" sort of affair.
---
I have no trouble running the Battle.Net client through lutris on Arch. If you can run the retail client now, then the beta client shouldn't cause you any trouble. I didn't have to do anything extra to get the beta running, just choose it in the dropdown and install. Works flawlessly for me.
---
Gonna have to see a source for this one. I've only seen him say "first few weeks" ... as well as this one: ""There will never be layering after phase 1, period. Quote me on that." (the latter quote obviously making it quite clear that layering MIGHT go longer than they intend)
---
In the below video, Ion clearly says that layering is to maintain server health after rapid drop off (and so there won't be queues at launch - which is obviously a secondary benefit). He THINKS that drop off will happen rapidly (i.e., "first few weeks"). But if it doesn't, layering will persist and Blizzard is committed to that idea as well...

A lot worse. Go to for paladin healers throughout MC &amp; BWL is Wild Growth Shoulders (leather) &amp; Robes of the Exalted (cloth), which provide 62, and 68 +healing respectively. Wild Growth Shoulders provide just over 40 more+ healing than the paladin tier 1 and like 50+ healing more than paladin tier 2. They are best in slot for Shamans, Druids and Paladins through most of the raid content in the game. 
---
[Robes are pre-bis](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346) for EVERY healer class, so lets use those as a comparison. 68+ healing versus 18 damage and healing from [Plate of the Shaman King](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13168). The stats are way better on Robe too. There is no competition.
---
Good luck farming the Wetland Whelps, that will be one of the most overfarmed spot in the whole Game.
---
don't play then, you wont be missed.
---
I wonder wonder which item list is more accurate for ench shamans, the one you used or:

Holy shit the negative comments... 
---
“These aren’t realistic!” 
---
“You’re not playing the way I play! Go slower through this content you’ve seen 50x before!”
---
I love these posts. It’s cool to see, in an ideal setting, with practice, how fast you can push through the first few levels. Keep em coming! Much better than whiny posts, or old screenshots of vanilla toons standing around Ironforge.
---
My main thought is the difference between Retail and Classic is so outrageously wide that adding things like Server transfers and that side of the in game shop, only brings them like 5% closer. The gameplay, game mechanics, skill trees, talent trees, etc. are more of the reason retail is so different than classic.
---
I do agree with the idea of "Give them an inch and they'll take a mile". So being okay with paid services like server transfers and the like is a hard pill to swallow. But I honestly think if paid services like server transfers and race changes keep WoW tokens and LFR/LFD/LFG out of classic, i'll very happily accept them.
---
Im not sure how much time il be able to dedicate, first il atleast get to 60, then heal as a holy paladin in dungeons get some gear, do MC ony BWL casually and maybe rank to like around 9 10 for some decent pvp ret gear. Hopefully clear everything in vanilla at some point, not gonna rush it.

 I don't think it will be so bad. Watched the other day a video describing how mobs were overtuned by a lot on private servers. Apparently it's much easier to level as a warrior on the beta than on private servers we are used to. It was a huge difference actually. Here is the video, it's well worth checking out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48WF9uIpZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48WF9uIpZo) 
---
 Also I leveled a warrior on retail back in the day and I don't have any specific memories of it being that bad. It was so long ago though that it's hard to draw on memory and state an opinion for sure. 
---
 Bottom line is people will have no problem at all leveling a warrior. We are better at gaming today than back in retail classic, know more about the game. Many players were just kids as well back then. Also people have been playing on private servers solo leveling warriors. Since classic will be much easier they will have a very easy time.
---
It’s like a reward for the extra effort required to find and download addons as opposed to being available to everyone by default
---
Why does warlock go Sash of Whispered Secrets in phase 2, to Nemesis Belt in Phase 3, back to Sash of Whispered Secrets in Phase 4?
---
They will turn it off when the servers stabilize. When they see there is way less flux ... this will avoid merges down the road.
---
I'm at work and restrictions won't let me look this up atm, but what is I.S (druid)?
---
It’s high risk/high reward, because killing someone or a group of people is a rush you can’t get on PvE servers. With your same ignorant logic, one could say you aren’t even playing the game at all, ever, on a PvE server. Of course neither that nor what you said are true, because the game is different things for different people.
---
Good grief, of all the responses I've read on this thread this is the one that resonated with me the most.  Who needs to brush their teeth or clean their asshole when you got levels to grind?
---
That isn’t ninja looting. You had every right to need that.
---
if you're a shaman you'll never have to worry about a raid spot, you can never have enough of those
---
Anyone know where this scene is from?
---
Oh man, sick job comparing baseball fans to gamers. 100% identical comparison and legit critic. 
---
Pretty sure she only played WoW once or twice according to an interview I just dug up. The only celebrity I believe to actually have played the game more than casually was Verne Troyer.
---
3 part t2 bonus
---
Aside from being a nice round number, i think this is as high as we can go without having to redesign the talent system. In BFA we don't even get new abilities or talents past lvl 100, so what's even the point of those extra 20 levels?
---
PvP servers are for low brow masochists.
---
I leveled my warrior during the same time period and always 2h tanked during the leveling dungeons. Only time I didn't 2h tank was if I was running with a healer I didn't know.
---
yes, the mobs i was able to chain kill was after i got away from the pack.
---
Hobbs is a god damn legend, you watch your mouth!
---
If you're gonna use it then need it.
---
What is IS and how is druid good for this?  What kind of gear/spec do you need?
---
That was my point? This sub is hella small compared to the who is actually going to play the game.
---
And oh shit forgive me. 1.2%. I thought "about 1%" incompased 1.2% but fuck me for not giving an exact specific.
---
It's more about your attitude than what you plan to do.  If I was that guild and you blindsided me like that, I would make it my mission to message every new guild you joined to warn them.  Nothing wrong with asking to play shadow.  Why can't you just do that upfront?
---
Can some explain to me what the argument for getting rid of suggest invite is? I get that it wasnt in vanilla but isn't that one those minor convenience things they wanted to keep? I can't imagine any negative gameplay because of it
---
I’m completing that stupid Green Hills of Stranglethorn quest. I want all the pages. Idk if it’s even possible. I don’t want to google it, I’m just going to try

Then you don't understand
---
I'm gonna ignore the part where you are helping him. You could argue that you helping him means you deserve the item but i can't be bothered to go into that.
---
As for needing for equip and needing for gold. There's 2 contradicting philosophies on this topic. One says that all BoE items have equal worth to any player, since you can sell it on AH for its full value. So there's no reason that one should have priority on this BoE item as it's just seen as a flat gold sum.
---
the other side argues that need &gt; greed, and that anything that is an upgrade has priority over its gold worth, as long as it's equipped by the player who needs.
---
The community decides what is okay and what is not, and currently there's no conceive agreement to which one these 2 philosophies are correct.

You get a portal with a 4hr CD to gadget or everlook

" *How will you prevent The Blacklist from being abused?*
---
&gt;ONLY streamers and their guilds will be added. To prevent false positives, all guilds in the coalition from both factions must approve of a name or guild being added and there will be a recorded history of each name on the list available on our realm-wide Discord."  
---
You already have toxic people like /u/EveClassic running around claiming they will blacklist anyone they don't like because they are an "author' of the addon. Noone is going to use your addon when you represent it like this.
---
If you have a shadowpriest in the raid, warlocks are as good or better than mages. Good warlocks will use mana potions and demonic runes on cooldown so they don’t have to lifetap (which is a DPS loss). If you do that you’ll beat all the mages except for the one getting the ignite tick
---
I'm going to be playing alongside my brother and I can't decide if I want to play as a priest or warlock.
---
He used to play back in vanilla resto druid and I played a little bit (never made it to cap) as a warlock on horde.
---
We are pretty busy so idk how much time we can both invest (he has a 2yr and I am mid-degree) and we tend to focus on casual pvp and pve.
---
On one hand, I really like warlock for pvp and for pve (I will be alliance this time, so it would be a nice change)
---
on the other, priest+warrior is great for bgs and leveling, and I like priest pvp (mostly shadow though)
---
I'm just not a huge fan of healing in pvp as it often means being focused all the time and I won't have the gear or maybe skill to pull it off and enjoy it. 
---
I can't make up my mind... Most important to me is PvP, I don't need to be best, just want to be able to 1v1, be useful with damage etc...
---
I've read spriest is not a real option unless you got time to invest and it's sorta gimmicky unless you commit to it, which I can't really.
---
I've been reading up a ton, I'll gladly listen to any advice to help me make up my mind.
---
The idea alone for Classic was probably sold to the executive level on the pretense that Classic would tempt some players on the Classic realms to check out retail again (since they "might as well"; it's part of their subscription value) and get them playing both versions of the game, where their chances of spending microtransaction money on retail will go up.
---
well shit, lan party w/ friends and keg... fuck the diet man, this sounds like it's going to be some good times.
---
Because on Pservers you had people Tanking during progression as DW Fury. At least that's what Skarm mentioned and went further to say "This never happened in Vanilla"
---
Then again that could just be because in Vanilla progression everyone was still learning/not refined as everyone is now a decade of time and information later.
---
Why even post then? I call this manipulation. "Uh well, i don't want this but it's great". "Maybe later". What exactly did you expect to happen in a discussion like this?
---
I would not take polls about classes too seriously.
---
Warriors and paladins/shamans always are very high on the list, yet it could take hours waiting for tanks and healers.
---
So you would have to know if the player is playing dps only, is the player doing pvp only, is he quitting before 60, is it a casual friendly class etc.
---
Also the amount of dwarf priests for example is super high in polls. Sure it will probably be higher than vanilla, but someone on reddit and other forums is much more likely to be a min-maxer than the average player.
---
Prioritize things that matter to me over maximizing my progression in the game.
---
Its so funny, that, even without stats you and I have an identical list. I raided in 2004 vanilla and private servers and its always the same proportion. The big outlier in the list is indeed hunters who are plentiful in server but not wanted in raid in near the same proportion. So thats the only class id be apprehensive about playing if you want a raid spot
---
As long as we fight it and shame buyers back to retail.
---
I ran a glyph empire.
---
I had every recipe and built an inventory of 20 of every glyph. Then every 4-6 hours, I would undercut every glyph in the AH by quite a bit. This would drive the price to cost very quickly. It basically drove the competition away. (I was dealing in such bulk that my cost was 20-90 silver)
---
When I had a glyph uncontested, I charged 80g. Because I was so aggressive with the competition, nobody stuck around that had all the glyphs. 
---
Funny story, I just reactivated my account and I have an insane inventory of charred glyphs. About three guild bank tabs full of them, all vendor trash today.
---
I joined the WoW game pretty late and could only get to lvl 45 before BC came out. I hope to have the patience and time to get a level 60 this time.
---
in a raid?
---
well again why care about DPS you are there for shadow weaving
---
To each their own :) I like Trolls a lot, but for Casters, UD take the cake for me
---
Very real lol. I remember watching it many times on TV when I first started the game.
---
Why is everyone obsessed with topping the dps meter? I don't care whether I come 1st, 10th or whatever, as long as I'm contributing in some way.
---
What's annoying about her? It's fine if you don't love her but I can't see how she would be irritating

Maybe you are right, maybe not.
---
One way of thinking about it is that Classic is mtx being _removed_ from WoW. 
---
They are seperate games for the most part, but they share a sub. If retail flops and Classic booms, it may be read that that is because of its design, monetisation model included.

My cousin showed me this back in 2006, my first introduction to WoW ha.

It really does not matter. Raids are easy enough to clear them without having only Rogues and Mages! Play whatever is fun to you, except the 1% tryhard guilds you can find a Raid even as a RetPally or Shadowpriest.

There is a water globe quest in ashenvale. Not the one related to BFD, which gives you a belt that you won’t replace for a while. Damn near 20 levels or more if you get it at 23(earliest you can). Quest item drops off tideress a 27 elemental who spawns in the lake by silverwing refuge.
---
Warsong supplies quest in Ashenvale as well.
---
The BFD water globe quest is soloable if you have decent gear. Leggings of the fang can also be solo’d at ~20, 22 makes it really easy since you’ll have distract for getting by the mobs.
---
Don’t forget the Gnomer quest for triprunner’s another quest item that lasts for 20 levels or so.
---
They can beat rogues that's about it

He's literally just saying all this so people will sub to his stream I hope you guys get that he's tried to make money...

Thanks !
---
I have no clue about PVP as I've always only raided in WoW.
---
As for PVE, you never have to farm shards ever. There's only 1 scenario which are things like sapp/KT/Cthun progression when people actually might as you for a hearthstone (still not many) and there being no trash to reclear, not even the next night.
---
Other than that, say you do Onyxia after MC. Before sulfuras you already start draining on every trashmob to make sure your shardbag and even your normal bag are full on shards, so when MC ends, you can summon slackers to onyxia ánd are already set for the next raidnight.
---
Lock shards in PVE are more like mana management than anything else really, keep your eye on shards during raids and you won't ever have to shardfarm outside of them.
---
Your rotation doesn't use shards (A shadowburn either always refunds it from smaller mobs you use it on + times you use it on movement isn't a lot in other cases, even frowned upon for debuff-limit reasons). So you'll be fine most of the time.

That's nice, now put on your [dress](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346) and cast flash of light.

Look at the response to your stupid addon. The community as a whole thinks you are a joke.
---
I'm so glad people didn't listen to folks like you when it came to Classic WoW, otherwise we wouldn't have it today.
---
That's right. I think of all that stuff as crappy daily quests with no rep or gold rewards.
---
It's kinda like wearing a I &lt;3 NY shirt  if you're from India?

As long as Activision wants it to be successful, they will keep monetization out.
---
As soon as they monetize it, it will cease to be successful.
---
Better than retail imo. I personally have more fun with 1-2 mob pulls in classic than pulling 50 on retail while eating soup and watching Netflix
---
I too am rolling EU and would be down to be part of a reroll guild
---
I would disagree that you severely gimp yourself.  If you compiled a list of pre-raid BiS that was only mail and plate, the differences are marginal.

Dw about it, grouping with people is some of the best way to level if you are in it for the long run, me and my friends are doing it as well, and people are always welcome to join us.
---
Petitions are explicitly against the forum rules, though. Why are you surprised a forbidden topic is hidden?
---
Warriors are great. I played arms and was never low on dmg meters and off tanking or even grabbing a boss when tank dies was no problem.
---
Tanking dungeons as a dps warrior was fine and nobody expected you to be prot.
---
I dont know why people push this narrative that warriors are impossibly difficult to not be a total shitter on.

thats just the BS gatekeeping I personally remember seeing your name spout. I would wager you are the sort whose history is full of gatekeeping playstyles.
---
I mean typically for BOE world drops everyone needs. Since everyone helped out and some BOE"s are worth a LOT of money.
---
If it's friends / guildies it is different, but in my experience on Pservers that is what happens with valuable BOE's.
---
I don't think needing to use is a problem, but don't be suprised if everyone else needs to sell it if it is an expensive BOE.
---
The moment monetisation hits classic then it stops being classic
---
Yup. That and melee/physical overscaling makes warriors insane in naxx.
---
thanks fuck cloth

Are you talking about Rhok'Delar? I managed to get it in vanilla and it was probably the most epic experience I've ever had in a video game. The demons were all really fun except for the asshole in Winter spring. I sucked at kiting and he kept bugging out. I killed him 3 times before I was able to loot him.
---
This is why I wonder if people will be open to letting blizzard attempt some balancing..  maybe 8-12 months after release so we got plenty of time to enjoy the true original experience. Old school RS started to fall off after a year or 2 too because we got worn out on the same content
---
The rule is : if you're gonna equip it then you roll need. 
---
It's also common to offer a small reward when a player goes offtrack to help you,short story you did nothing wrong. 
---
Since it's beta I also took the habit to not sell any Boe in ah, for testing purposes it's better to mail them to your guildmates and make their characters stronger
---
Mila Kunis also talks about playing wow
---
Westfall is more fun
---
Probably not what that guy is talking about but some people have been discussing the possibility that ret gearing like a warrior isn't the right way to go to maximize dps. It's uncertain right now what bis for ret paladins will actually be.
---
I want Jeff Fucking Kaplan down there playing the beta.  Tigole Bitties needs to get that warrior leveled up, and do some goddamn testing.  Daddy Jeff always knows.
---
Sometimes the cons are more important than the pros.
---
There will be wow tokens within the first year

I'd love to play on an RP-PVP server, feels like the most authentic way to play if you truly want to play an mmorpg like wow.
---
We set it up where you have to bid a % of your total DKP with a min bid of 10%
---
Even at 30-35 there won’t be many horde who can challenge you
---
Like, can you read? That was my entire point. This sub is pathetically small compared to people who are actually going to play. This sub just has a huge entitlement issue and expects WoW classic to cater to their entire demands list. If it doesn't the game is going to die.
---
It’s called Paralysis by Analysis. 
---
There is too much information about this game and its classes. If you search you will find something to discourage you from rolling what you want. It’s inevitable with something that’s been around for years. The reason no one can pick a main is because they know all the faults of each class and at the end of the play must choose a fault to be stuck with. Back in the day, you would just roll a class because it looked cooler than the other ones or something trivial. It’s easy to grind when you have no idea what comes next. Today, everyone knows how much time it takes to get to 60 and don’t want to waste it on a class they won’t like. But then you’re stuck in Paralysis by Analysis. The only way to overcome this is to close your eyes and pick. Just do it.
---
Nice !
---
Human racial op? It's like the shittiest race on alliance imo, about the same as night elves.
---
I do consider it for PvP so may be better in PvE.

NE racial shadowmeld accounts for 2 talent points in increased stealth. This comes from a pvp rogue sorrana who played a NE rogue to R14.

I.S. is insect swarm. So long as you have that plus caster gear, you're good and will down her in a reasonable time frame.

George Fisher is a huge nerd but I’m not sure how much of a celebrity he is in the band Cannibal Corpse lol
---
"Then again that could just be because in Vanilla progression everyone was still learning/not refined as everyone is now a decade of time and information later."
---
"Pservers were FAR easier than Vanilla. Tanks tanking Naxx and AQ 40 as dual weilding Fury Warriors are all the proof you need of that."
---
Okay?
---
“To use” gets a little iffy with BoE’s since they can typically sell for slot of gold and are only typically useful for a limited level range before you’d replace them anyway. 
---
From my experience when BoE’s drop everyone rolls need so there is no “ninja” scenario and if winner wants to sell on the spot go for it.
---
So the Warrior did their job then. You wasted your CC, focus and GCD on him vs another player.
---
What you need to understand about class abundance is also what the raid comps look like. Yes there's a lot of people that is playing shaman, but every raid wants like 6 shamans. Compare that to say druid where a typical guild only has 2 druids. Suddenly shamans aren't that overplayed at all. 
---
From my experience rshaman is the easiest horde class to find a raiding guild in.
---
That’s retarded
---
If the BoE is valuable enough to generate questions like these, you should always Need on it.
---
the north remembers!
---
I don't think they'll do any MTX in classic because that's what they have retail for. Classic and Retail will be for 2 different audiences, and by bringing us Classic, Blizz will be able to recapture another audience that they missed out since Cata. 
---
There's no reason for them to do much of anything with classic, at least during the 1st 6 phases. It will require them minimal effort on the dev side and subs can only go up for those interested.
---
I was referring to https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/hall-of-fame/mythic-raid/crucible-of-storms?faction=ALLIANCE
---
Where alliance has 18 guilds completed content and horde already has the max of 100.

---
There's a huge discussion of how to gear prot pally but there's basically 2 ways.
---
Full mitigation and try to fight warriors for BIS BWL and Nax trinket, Nax Neck, Blessed qiraji shield
---
Or go full SP for Max threat and stack stam on gear you can easily roll on as an off healer, both are viable for raiding
---
I don’t find her irritating but I also don’t understand her popularity either. The first few times deadpan humor can be funny but every interview and show she’s the same person. IIRC she was different in Legion though.
---
PreBIS isn’t about whether you obtain it or not. PreBIS is PreBIS, regardless of how rare it is.
---
Ive joined a discord guild but they are already a group of hardcore people. We could just play together and join a random guild since there will be a lot of em
---
Quicker bg queues? That's a meme. Beta and vanilla surveys show near 50/50 ally horde ratios, and there are *plenty* of people who talk about how their server was heavily alliance in vanilla, including the biggest WoW Classic YouTuber, MadSeason. 
---
That one is certifiably false.
---
Some inception shit going on in here.
---
Another good idea is to sit in a city, and advertise you'll make free bags for people if they bring you the cloth. Presumably you provide the thread.
---
It's a great way to effectively get skill ups on cloth you don't even have.
---
Vanilla talent trees went through several iterations, not only one. Everyone's trees were pretty bad. This *did* give an advantage to static base damage classes like casters, but it hardly made Warrior DPS "useless". By the time BWL was around warriors were already competitive in raids.  
---
My warrior was a variation of 31/5/15 for a long time before switching to Fury once our raid started controlling debuffs slots more and getting better at the game.  
---
Here's a link to a way-back set of talents. There are past 1.0 talents, but still before they were finalized. Notice how Fury's core DPS generating abilities are in place and fully working:

Can I level as a shockadin? I will have a buddy playing with me?
---
Yep thats whats concerning me how fucked the servers will be and how much more of a clusterfuck it is to then try to force people to move off to other servers or new servers etc.
---
It’s fine if u equip. I had someone do this once on a twink 18 ring of the monkey +3 +3 and I kept saying equip it and he acted like he had no idea what I was saying and just went silent. That little dick.
---
a green BoE worth 2g on the AH is valuable enough to Need it
---
no, it's not a question
---
What do you mean if it existed? For classic? Because it does if thats what youre saying
---
You are living in a parallel world my friend.
---
wartank is incredibly time consuming, you will also not find a place in raids unless you can dedicate the several hours for raid nights during the week.  Also expensive, due to repairs and consumables, so again, time consuming because you need to farm money.  Unless you find a weekend raiding guild, its unlikely youll be able to do this.
---
Mage/warlock are mostly in the same boat.  Mages will be more popular so they may gear slower in a raid, but ultimately they will probably be more wanted as DPS.  Warlocks will have lower dps, but more utility for the raid (health stones, summons, curses), but ultimately both are solid choices.
---
I often see a single enchanting dust listed. So much clicking.
---
People who only sell full stacks, you da real MVP.
---
None of this data is relevant to classic though. Vanilla data is 15 years old and the core player base is significantly different than it was back then.  Also pservers tend to represent more of a meta oriented group of people. They are a small population of overall classics population. 
---
So, no one fucking knows. 
---
The reddit poll was showing equal faction splits which would indicate even que times but at this point who knows. All speculation.
---
You really don't need that much NR in the wall. You don't even have to drop hit cap for it. DPS doesn't suffer that badly if your raid is coordinated and practiced.
---
How are you gonna reply "never was it that bad" to a video showing that at one point it was literally that bad lol.
---
This fortnite = bad shit is getting tired.
---
One of my guildees would send stuff C.OD. And add a number to the title to:Primal Water (20).
---
Made him his flying Mount - bank alt did not get much love.
---
That’s not a cool scam.
---
It's a very capable spec as druids are very good dungeon tanks. I found them easier to tank 90% of situations than a warrior tank. Healing is only slightly challenging because druids have the fewest instant heals, but down ranking will allow for quick casts. Only downside is your 30 minute res, so group with classes that can res.
---
With randoms`?
---
Yes. That's probalby too much to ask for most players.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is enchanting mats can be listed for free on the AH. I always keep that in mind when listing an item, if it doesn’t sell I will lose the deposit. Enchanting mats that’s less important
---
Iron Bar:  Sells for 7g/stack.
---
Coal:  Buy from vendor for 50s/stack.
---
1 Stack Iron Bar + 2 Stacks Coal = 1 stack Steel Bar
---
Steel Bar:  Sells for 15g/stack.
---
Do the math.
---
I'm confused why you have Resto Shaman taking 5 piece aq-40 when it'll be better off-setting other pieces.
---
I understand how powerful the 5 set bonus is for chain heal but you're losing almost 200healing power and almost 20 MP5 by not off-setting into better cloth pieces.
---
Yeah, I agree, fuck those paladins.
---
[Here's my T2 shamy](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/dalaran/bonedancer)
---
Communication in dungeons would make everything far easier since the days of ventrillo and bad bandwidth are over.
---
My plan is tailoring/eng - playing with a friend who will be mining/herbalism and will give me mining mats for eng.
---
Once I farm and make Robe of the Archmage, I'll drop tailoring for herbalism for raiding purposes (I do a lot of World PvP and gettting dreamfoil/black lotus while hunting Alliance is a bonus).
---
My friend will drop mining once I max Eng and pick up Alchemy
---
I think it might be OK to throw a couple of pieces of mail in there, if they have good stats?
---
That's excessive.  Only do it with groups of friends.  There are no leveling dungeons that require PvP reaction times, and typing is sufficient.
---
Unfortunately modern vanilla wow went from a dream of a dedicated few, to an activision product for the masses.
---
Lol. Implying choosing a human mage and losing out on the Gnomes ~8-9 intellect at level 60 means something. I hope you're trolling and not actually that stupid looooooooooooool
---
In raids where they're being fluffed by a shaman/paladin, feral druid, and stacked world buffs. In a 5 to 20 person situation, mages should absolutely destroy the meters, especially if there's lots of aoe.
---
&gt;Never need to sell
---
I wish I could honor this rule always, but you’ll get fucked over more often than not. 80% of the time a BoE blue drops in dungeon 2 will greed, 2 will wait to see if anyone rolls need, and the 5th will need at the last second to sell. It’s hard to trust people enough to roll greed, and that sucks.
---
I agree though, if you equip it, it’s not ninja looting to roll need just because the guy said to greed.
---
Don't listen to people who think Prot isn't good for PvP.
---
Yes you don't do as much damage as other specs but playing a "Tank" in PvP isn't something you're concerned about killing people as.
---
When you play Prot in PvP you have to have a different mindset. 
---
You're meant to be a nuisance to the other team.
---
You're meant to peel for your healers or district the enemies healers/back rank.
---
You're meant to be built to take damage and because of that draw attention to you via enemy CC, GCD, just simply switching targets to you vs any of you allies means you're creating an advantage for your team.
---
Damage and cooldowns used on you is an absolute win for your team because you're meant to take it, they just wasted time and GCD in you vs your allies.
---
Now, that all being said, Prot in PvP is only really viable in a premade setting or if you are grouped with some people who can actively capitalize off having you there to peel/distract the opponents.
---
this thread is full of ppl predicting the future which is one of the easiest ways to fool yourself
---
I would say transfers is all good , I think maybe.
---
My problem with the shop is it starts diluting that "oh wow that guy has X, crazy farm or drop rate" kind of shit if you can spend a tenner and get a shiny mount instead. That's a big element of it for me.
---
Paladins are amazing end game healers both PVP and PVE. Blessing are way better than the group based totems.
---
Fear ward is way better than having to rely on tremor totem for tanks. 
---
Alliance cities don’t look like crap hovels with skins for roofs. 
---
Human Rep gain is really good for the many grindy reps in Classic. 
---
Most of the best melee weapons are either swords or maces so Human racial better than Orc by far. Before you say Whirlwind axe and Arcanite Reaper. I rebuttal with TUF, Asscandy Thunderfury, Corrupted Ashbringer and Might of Menithil. Weapons you will use for months rather than weeks. 
---
Stormwind and IF are way more close to Black Rock Mountain. The end game zone you will spend more time in than pretty much any other unless you are chasing the gong in Silithis. 
---
GM Alliance side weapons look Amazing! Horde equals look like crap. 
---
Shadowmeld ambush parties are fun. We used to have all my NE friends stealth or meld next to the road while I, a paladin, would “AFK” on the road. When someone would jump me they would be ambushed, aim shot, moonfired and charged/executed before they could blink. Good times. 
---
You will get more out of Stockades than RFC as far as XP.

NE mailbox dancing. 
---
Dwarf /flex best /flex.
---
Undead look like crap in any armor but cloth. 
---
Thrall is a Mary Sue even though Metzen is a BAMF. 
---
Duskwood is one of the best zones ever. 
---
Ummm Dwarf beards. 
---
That’s all I got for now.
---
&gt;So the Warrior did their job then. You wasted your CC, focus and GCD on him vs another player.
---
I barley even notice when a prot warrior shows up.  I put him in a trap and continue to kill people. He would have been much more useful as any other class.
---
Can mages effectively solo farm instances? Bosses can’t be slowed, feels like even Deadmines bosses would give you a hard time
---
You showed a bad player not a bad game
---
If I am filling a 5 man group and get whispered by a warrior dps, I just say our tank is a warrior (a pretty good chance) and move on to another dps. I would personally like to get as many people from diff gear sets to make everyones time a bit more worth it.
---
The irony of this post is pretty funny.
---
I think that's a bad habit that's developed on private servers.   
---
Need and greed are supposed to be different, rolling on a BoE that you're going to sell is \*\*greed.\*\*  
---
No matter what the quality of the item, need should be used if and only if you intend to use the item as an immediate upgrade.  
---
You can say well everyone rolling need eliminates the chances of someone ninjaing but, you're ultimately contributing to the system if you run around needing on things you don't need.
---
How you going to kill someone when you just wasted your CC on the Tank? The moment they bust out you've now been hamstinged and pummeled. Whoever you're aiming to kill now doesn't have to worry about you CC.
---
The Warrior did his job.
---
Shamans are empirically by far the most needed class on Horde side. But people will be allergic when you
---
Mention “enhance”.
---
What fire spell would a warlock spam in a raid?
---
Searing pain has too high of a threat generation to be spammed in raids, immolate's damage is crap and soul fire has a cooldown.  Shadowbolt is the only option.
---
there's nothing iffy about it, using it is not selling it
---
all items exist to be used or to be sold, that's why they drop, it doesn't matter if maybe you might possible replace it at the very next boss
---
encouraging full needs on BoEs is just selfish group behavior that prevents BoEs from being used by people who legitimately would get use out of them
---
Ignore the naysayers.
---
The moment you are a BWL geared and above Prot Warrior (just make sure you KNOW what talents to get), you are THE BEST possible option for Flag Carrier in WSG, the BEST base defender in AB and the unstoppable leader of AV pushes.
---
Yes, you will do crap damage...but that is not your role in PvP. You roles are the one above. But, again, AFTER you are T2 and above geared, and with proper talents.
---
Shield Slam?
---
Good damage + removes a beneficial buff off your opponent.
---
bruh he means spell power, chillax
---
Just to keep in mind for vanilla; if edgemasters or titan recipe drop in UBRS, people _will_ all need on it and so should you. Even though yes, in theory stuff should go to people who need, most won't care if the price of the item is this high and will literally save them months of farming.
---
In your case, you were in your full right. I never understood the 'always greed boe' crowd when people actually need and will use an item.
---
Bags will always be a money maker. When waves of tourists come in and make alts they will always want bags first and foremost. When the dedicated hit BIS and want to make an alt. When someone moves to the server to play with friends cause you can’t CRZ in Classic. Money.
---
Reeeeeaally? Like a custom map thing? How would it remember your heroes between maps?
---
low drop rate gathering quests.
---
Just need to mark kill targets and cc.  Isn't much more to it than that.
---
A somebody that played a slew of other MMO’s before WoW released, I can’t help but laugh when I hear somebody reference WoW leveling as difficult.  Even for a warrior.
---
Imagine thinking that’s not the case for every class’ PvP video. 
---
- only recording in tier 2 and above gear against fresh 60’s 
---
- only clipping when all rogue cds are up 
---
- only clipping when buffed and potted to hell with a pocket healer / dispeller. 
---
The list goes on 
---
Off the high horse mate.
---
I'm OK with people reserving things provided they are bringing the tank, if you need the reserved item don't run with them.
---
Vanilla is about making connections and friends. If you aren't willing to do that, you get to deal with reserves. 
---
What is annoying is a dps, often badly geared, trying to reserve things in a run where they are contributing none of the important roles.
---
I get if you are basically carrying the run, or a T2 warrior / healer combo running Strat for orbs, those are boons for the group and you should get some reward for it, but just making a group and thinking you can reserve things is odd to me.
---
I would probably only pay for a run if I got to reserve an item that was in high demand. Basically pay for that item.
---
But I plan to make friends and network, help others get their items and get my own, so I don't see this being a huge issue for me personally.
---
There are DOZENS OF US!
---
Does a little bit of AS (0.4s, as I won't tame broken tooth since it's way too hard unless I get ridiculously lucky) really beats the ability to cover viper sting ? 
---
I feel like most caster (except warlocks maybe) can really easily fear/root my pet when they want to cast something anyway, so that extra attack speed won't have that much impact compared to being able to drain their mana super fast, doing non physical damage or debuffing the physical damage.
---
Eh, none of these commercials are related to Classic. This campaign started in TBC.
---
In Warlords of Draenor, I got enough gold from my daily runs around my Garrison that I could reset the prices on trade goods.  For example, if there was an item that was selling for 1,000g (cheapest) to 10,000g (most expensive), then I'd buy all of them and sell them for 15,000g.  It might cost me 250,000g to buy all 80 of them, but then I'd make 1,200,000g on sales, for a profit of around 800k after AH cuts.  
---
That made it easier and easier to do this on more items at a time, or else bigger items.
---
Realm-wide Discord servers are going to be the kind of LFG. Naturally people will just hop in a channel after forming a group.
---
But I like the strawberry part...
---
In 99% of cases none of the tier 1 PvP classes are difficult to play until you fight another tier 1 class that is also skilled...
---
A good portion of vanilla comes down to The match up and gear. Not skill.  Just the truth.
---
Yeah, but there are still lots of chances to use it.
---
No no, I like this, this is good.
---
He asks for specifics after you call it bad, then take the time to reply with more “you’re bad”
---
Would be nice if paladins could not wear cloth lolz.
---
This is awesome for pvp though.
---
The recent stress test really got me excited.
---
You can still help by opening lockboxes!

The 5man leveling dungeons are straight forward enough that you wouldn't benefit a whole lot through voice chat.  It never really mattered too much from what I remember in vanilla.  I personally wouldn't bother getting into voice chat with randoms.
---
It can help for those bits of leather you need, but I think you would primarily use it to make money off the leather, a stack or 2 of each type of leather in total is usually more than enough.
---
On public forums, people post ideas and then other people reply with other ideas -- sometimes these followup ideas elaborate on the original idea and other times they argue against it.
---
There's an occasional goober who comes along and doesn't really quite understand how it works or is just mean for no reason other than not enough hugs from their dad ... but generally it's rather neat.
---
Why are pandas so bad when we have cows?
---
That's a hilarously good idea, however I would feel dirty creating a disgusting Nelf on my account, but I will definitly do that as an orc and just hide behind a hill or something
---
Warstomp is pretty great in solo PVE, but if you're looking at enhance or any kind of PVP, bloodfury.
---
dungeons are already super easy, no need for voice tbh
---
I'm in the same situation. I always play a healer of some kind, but this time I'm going mage or warlock. I always felt like I could do more as a hybrid, but in PvP I end up only ever healing. 
---
Just don't be one of those rogues that jumps in the front lines like a warrior.
---
You clearly didnt get the point. Pre-bis is what you try to get for Phase 1 progression, DM will be released in Phase 2 so its not about rarity at that point.
---
Pre-bis in this case is Painweaver Band and Blackstone Ring depending on your hit % as xfllaash pointed out with TERs.
---
My advice as an ex-raiding guild leader - you have to be firm. If someone in your guild is being an asshole, just kick them. I put up with way too much shit because I was trying to be too nice and accommodating and avoid drama, but this isn't a company, it's a game. Just remove the toxic people.
---
So that's a Trap that isn't used on another player. 
---
Now you're fighting a damage dealing class without one of your CCs.
---
People need to get their head out if their ass with the whole "They don't do enough DMG so they aren't viable" mindset.
---
If the Tank make an enemy waste GCD/CC/CDs/Mana on them vs their allies, they've created an advantage for their team that they can capitalize on.
---
Not to mention all the disruption a Prot Warrior can cause to healers/casters if ignored. Properly played you absolutely cannot just ignore a Prot Warrior in your back ranks or peeling for another player. There's too much chaos and disruption they can cause.
---
God damn it internet.....how is this a thing?!
---
He clearly understands
---
What ?! The first zones I can understand skipping reading quests as they are literally just "hey bring me some wolf pelts pls and thx", but the higher you level, the more interesting the quests become !  
---
You actually learn about the lore of each zone and races, and quests that send you through different continents and dungeons are truly epic to read.  
---
You really shouldn't be judging how all quests are "meaningless" if you stopped after the first 2 hours.
---
I'm an orc.
---
That's a benefit I didn't consider at all for the bat actually. Which makes it even harder to decide.
---
"you don't like being ganked all the time? IGNORANT!!!"
---
Found the undead rogue.
---
i am quite torn between Restro Druid and Holy Palladin, i tried hpalla in private servers, and i was shocked how terrible holy shock is, it doesn't scale well, and 30s  cd. but besides that, is Holy palla a viable healer for lvl 60 raiding ?!
---
I do all of my transactions on my bank alt.  Nobody knows my bank's name except for me.  Not even by best friend knows it.
---
I would love Roth UI on my undead toons for Classic. The UI just fits them to me.
---
Even then, with BWL trinket you spamming holy light for 15seconds massively improves raidhealing and gives you a cooldown to use. Vanilla isn't built upon sustained raidwide dmg anyway thankfuly.
---
Healing as a paladin never really felt handicapped to me in raids. saving people with fol spam while others have time to actually toss out multi-target heals feels just as rewarding.
---
The only problem I always had was in 5mans, when my full naxx geared maintank thought they could now pull 10 packs at a time in scholo, but my paladin still being limited by a measly fol per person.
---
Guarding a point in AB was fun.  If you don't feel dirty you're doing it wrong.

---
Much more useful than that site.
---
tier one is poo.
---
Those are the [Submarines from WC2](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_turtle_battle_sub).
---
&gt; They take less damage and they do more threat.
---
That's not right for AOE threat. Warrior AOE threat is TERRIBLE in comparison to a druid.
---
Druids also have more burst threat, but once a warrior gets rolling they are much better than a druid on threat.
---
Where?
---
This is just not true.  Some people simply prefer the earlier versions of a game.  Myself my favorite Civ games are 1 and 3.  Not because "they are doing it wrong" but I've been playing them since launch for like 30 years.
---
Just because you didn't like the direction the game evolved in doesn't mean it's wrong.  Your wrong is a lot of people's right.  There are still plenty of people who enjoy retail.  MMOs are just not the spotlight genre anymore.
---
Yup. just wanted to point out that he was talking pre-bis, maybe could have done it a bit nicer :)
---
Sometimes this is necessary.  For example, if you have a trade good that vendors for 3s, and is up for 2s95c on the AH.
---
you can't proc JoL, JoW, shadow oil, dragonbreath chili, that is with SoR.  
---
funny thing is that SoR is proccing % chance on hit from weapons, but not the added ones.  
---
That means, you could probably proc flurry axe and Ironfoe on SoR, now tell me if that isn't weird (would be crazy op btw)?  
---
SoR was meant to proc some things because it is instant attack with white hit, it function as one, but it should not proc weapon %chance on hit.  
---
Spellbatching is making the game weird in some aspects...
---
Assuming it's a new fork of the game and the leave some purely classic realms, I'd love that.
---
Ouch
---
But it’s the truth. Playing less than 2 hours a day means you’ll need 7-8 months just to hit level 60. At that point it’s best not to bother playing at all.
---
Well, the patch notes don't mention updates to SoR prior, so its safer to assume it does than that it doesn't.
---
All data is from pservers, what you learned online, take it with a grain of salt.
---
This type of person never will. The good thing is... who cares?
---
No, [we know what those look like in WoW](https://imgur.com/Hx1JQBJ).
---
This!
---
Weapon skill on hunters is extremely overrated.
---
Fortnite isn't a bad game though. Peoples main critique is that the community is annoying. 
---
His clip was showing that WoWs community was just as bad (honestly it was worse) at one point.
---
rogues are still super helpful, great dps, lockboxes and lockpicking
---
Yeah. This is a great point.
---
Like, BEST case scenario. I can imagine them possibly adding content, perhaps a new area. I can't imagine adding a continent or anything dramatic without making people pay for expansion packs, which would defeat the purpose of Classic wow.
---
My point is you’re not saying anything. It’s like your mad people can do math or something. 
---
I’m scared that people will do the math and see that the class I want to play is pretty shit in most scenarios and I rather everyone just forget about that and just be okay with it anyway. 
---
Bro - obviously some people are not going to give a fuck. Some people are. 
---
You’re just not saying anything except that you wish things were a certain way while also saying that you know it’s dumb because it will never be that way.  Chill out. It’s a game. Just go have fun. Nerd.
---
You can do this but you’ll find it harder to get into groups. Personally if a Druid tank said he was going to join and compete with me for healing gear I would just not invite and find a war instead. It’s just better to not have competition as the healer...
---
Not to mention a Prot Warrior can still stance dance and macro a 2h equip to toss a WW off if they have to push some DMG.
---
Dealing damage isn't the be all end all in PvP. Sometimes the situation calls for utility and support which a Prot can provide quite well.
---
Like I said in another comment, when played properly a Prot Warrior cannot simply be ignored if he's in your back ranks disrupting your healers/casters. Not only that but when you do finally focus on them they take longer to kill which results in more time the enemies aren't attacking your actual damage dealers
---
And sleep is for the weak i guess.
---
&gt;Boars are by far the best PvP pet, but you have to use charge manually.  Having an extra snare trumps all the other pet abilities.
---
I feel like this is overlooked a lot. They also eat anything, so that's nice for leveling.
---
This happened with so many BoE epics in Vanilla.  Each server approached the situation differently, and constantly, CONSTANTLY, there was bitching.
---
Yes, an item upgrade would help your character a little bit, but gold will help everyone.  I'm of the mind that everyone just rolls need on BoEs and people losing their shit about it being an upgrade to them learn how to raid and get better gear, or farm enough to buy it from the AH.  That's not even considering the legitimacy of the player equipping the item.  Remember, you are usually playing with nerds, and nerds are greedy goblins, chortling over fucking someone else over online often.  Never trust potential scumbags.  
---
Everyone just roll need.
---
If you are in a dungeon and people start to bully you into giving the item to someone else, hearth.  Immediately /wave and hearth.
---
Our guild got to that Naaru boss before the pre patch nerf. I was the main tank healer as a hpally, but he's not wrong about the shaman stacking and lock stacking
---
You do realize ret paladins have freedom and joj and can deadzone kite a warrior if they step back to intercept, right? Did you start in cata or something?
---
Err, Wrath was the beginning of homogenization. That's when "bring the player, not the class" was at the forefront.
---
Tauren 1000000% had larger hitboxes, theres even a video of Kungen talking about it years ago in one of his vods.
---
You can also easily tell the difference in Pat's pvp video how comically large his swing range is especially when he charges.
---
Sometimes you're late to the raid and forgot to restock on arrows so you drop into the AH and buy the first thing you see.
---
Well there it is, the difference, so long we had good run.
---
Now to run off into my scandinavian sunset.

I don’t think I’m the only one who thought early-mid 40s was doable. 
---
Not saying you’re wrong and I’m right, just that I remember it being 40s and a quick search shows other people have reported the same.
---
You can manually set EVs and IVs on showdown, also in the past EVs were set to 0 by default and it didnt warn you.  
---
I have about 100 selfbred perfect pokemon on my cartridge, I love minmaxing but I know I could beat most people without it just fine. I stand by my initial statement, minmaxing is great and powerful, but the overarching strategy is still much more important. The fundamentals is most important in pretty much any game/art/cooking what ever
---
cows sustain the human race, pandas can even sustain themselves when literally everyone is running in circles trying desperately keep them alive
---
&gt; So that's a Trap that isn't used on another player. 
---
Sure, but if that other class/spec he might done more than stand there as a Popsicle for the fight.  The least useful thing you can be in a BG is a prot warrior.  You're not even worth spending the time to kill because you're such a non threat.
---
youll want at least one maybe 2 ferals for the buff depending on your raid comp.
---
i wouldn't necessarily call them "bad choices" for you. Both prot warrior and mages are great, but here's what im thinking
---
Warriors are the slowest lvlers in the game, so if you don't have a lot of time to play each day, you will almost for sure fall behind your friends. And if you want to tank raids at 60, that requires a lot of preperation and dedication to having the right consumables, and the right gear. From what i've heard, being a tank for raids in vanilla is extremely time consuming. I might be wrong, and someone correct me if i am. 
---
Mages are a lot of fun aswell. Their kit and playstyle is completely different to that of a warlock. You really can't go wrong with a mage either. In the end it really comes down to personal prefference. 
---
My advice is to look up PvP videoes and what not on the classes you're considering. Go with whatever looks the most fun and appealing to you. 
---
But i really do think you'll enjoy playing a warlock.
---
If you want to thank as pally while leveling, your first 11 talents will be in holy. To get consecrate at 20. Its a MUST. Can't really tank before then. After that you can go ret. Use a 2 hander while questing and just switch to a 1h and shield when you need to tank. You'll be just fine as ret tank all the way to 60. So long as you keep your tank gear relevant, and have consecrate.
---
Yes,
---
But can a tauren shaman do the orc call of earth quest? Or orc the tauren one?
---
The goal is to farm trash, not bosses. Plus you will be 60, you will one shot a boss in deadmines.
---
AOE sure. For single target, not that it's as good as WF, but mages have CoE and benefit from each other stacking winter's chill. Everyone has raid buffs.
---
Do that and get out rolled by a need who’s gonna sell it. Every time.
---
I don't really see the "need" for voice chat in a 5 man with randoms. If you're with guildies/friends and want to shoot the shit that's fine.
---
The only time I myself really saw people using voice chat was for Baron runs. And sometimes for UBRS.
---
But for leveling? I can't really see it being popular. I have no issue chatting (typing) during runs, but personally I wouldn't feel the need to really talk during a run with randoms.
---
I've experimented with deep Protection for PVP and it's obviously great versus melee, but pretty bad overall: Shield Slam and One-handed Specialization are useless for PVP.
---
Also tried various 14/14/23 builds centered around switching between 1H/2H a lot, but rage remains a major issue and without Spell Reflect, you lack ways to capitalize on your improved CC and survivability.
---
End-game, as a caster, I actually struggle the most against Fury - the damage is output is high, they always have rage and Execute is a major threat when you drop too low. 
---
So in that sense, either tree is viable versus the right opponents, but Arms is nearly always superior in PVP.
---
Your friend sounds like a nice guy power leveling your professions for you.
---
FBI, open up!
---
Prot kicked ass in Wrath PVP. You are basically a bunch of stuns and utility that cannot be killed - Effectively slowing down the enemy while your team does all the DPS/Healing.
---
Not sure how this translates to Classic but I'd imagine it's a similar situation: A huge inconvenience that cannot be killed.
---
Hard to decide, since i missed all of it :D
---
Oh no, she’s definitely in full “hold up spork” mode in Parks and Rec.
---
This guy is available Monday thru Saturday. No grouping on sundays because he has to lead service at church
---
Ofcourse it happened, my guild asked me to bring my alt once too because lock was much stronger than my shaman for dps, but hardcore minmaxing is not even close to necessary in Vanilla, the raids are so easy you can do it with half a group without problem.
---
I want to get a Kalimdor's Revenge. My guild back in the day cleared BWL and MC many times, but we never made much progress in AQ40. Killed a few bosses here and there, but drama took hold by that point and we ended up disbanding.  I know it's not the best 2h sword in the game, but it's one I never acquired and I will perma-use it if/when I get one.
---
Lol yep. I mean who doesnt like blasting adds for 600dmg each.
---
Some fights you will get extra 10k damage from it.
---
hey im not a pedophile i just have a thing for kids mk
---
I usually go for the "if it's an upgrade, take it" philosophy. But sometimes certain items are twink preferred and can fetch quite a bit of money. I talk about it with people, if they can equip it right away go for it. If they want to sit on it for 2-3 levels, fuck em I want it.
---
It's really situational for me. I usually wait to roll last so I can see what everyone else is doing. It's a lot of money to pass up, but if it was an upgrade for me I'd want the mercy of the group.
---
..... yeah sure fortnight is not a bad game, I see you decided to enter the preposterous statement tournament
---
yeah, i played shaman restro as first char and since the always tank or heal or whichever class was in demand in our raid. even changed mains depending on need.
---
want to play hunter/rogue but i probably end up playing whats missing... its still nice to be needed
---
If you think its a problem that people roll need on things they intend to sell, you're part of that problem if you roll need on something you intend to sell.
---
People should be blacklisting people who ninjaloot, not joining them.
---
I miss that commercial, it was hilarious 😂
---
I agree that the levels in BFA especially were 100% pointless, but I dont think thats a numbers issue. You could 100% keep adding a talent row every expansion, its not that difficult.  
---
The bigger issue is how they keep adding levels without knowing why theyre even doing it. Honestly the biggest hurdle for retail is the fact that most devs working on it are incompetent lol
---
Put something valuable and popular on the AH for very cheap. Bid only, no buyout. When someone bids, overbid them. Sometimes the bidder will get frustrated, spam clicking bid again and again as if to say "Fuck off. This item is mine."
---
Set a ridiculously high bid, as high as you're willing to believe they have in their inventory.
---
I would honestly probably rather be dwarf for the poison immunity, that seems a lot more important against a rogue.
---
The plan or the response?
---
If I watch you equip it, then it's a legit need roll.
---
The response
---
I never want to see turtle cleave again.
---
Shamans on horde are basically always needed as horde guilds will be so filled to the brim with melees that they'll want not 5 but often even 6 shamans to give everyone windfury. The 'weaving' playstyle of windfury totem--&gt;put agi totem---&gt; have 2 GCD free to heal ---&gt;windfury totem--&gt;agi totem--&gt; 2GCD.... to me was so extremely boring to play to me, and as it seems like others as well, that I always saw every guild recruiting shamans. So don't worry.
---
And when the melee mentality of the overall realm's community shifts to the one resembling a pvt server one, you as a shaman will also be much preferred in 5mans by either a tank or tank+2 melees in group. Yes you will even have 5man groups looking for not a 'healer' , but a 'shaman' instead.
---
Shaman, Mage, Lock are I'd say the easiest classes to get into guilds with. Priest somehow often have a really strong team but from my tiny experience usually have a core roster that seeminly never quits the game. Locks are basically recruit bonanza throughout the entire expansion. And druids you simply need too few off which is problematic for recruits.
---
The best
---
Mages can do it easily and they have a chance to get a super bis weapon that they can use throughout all phases.
---
2nd best healer only behind priests.
---
What’s that?
---
Pardon if I'm wrong, but isn't Feet - Crystal Lined Greaves (Reward from Armaments of War) not available before AQ40 opens?
---
checking stuff like this feels like a pretty basic thing to do if you intend to give advice to people on what gear to use xd
---
Fixed in 1.10.
---
You might not enjoy it, that doesn't make it a bad game.
---
Games don't pioneer an entire genre by being bad.
---
I would be on a high horse if I made a pvp video myself and was being hypocritical.
---
As it stands, my reasoning is exactly why they're ALL kind of silly.
---
Thanks :)
---
Nah. You will suffer from low damage and rage starvation. Your only purpose will be as a damage sponge that stuns people, POSSIBLY removing magic buffs with shield slam, and silencing spellcasters with improved shield bash. You will be able to run a flag pretty well but really the rage starvation issue is the big one. You kind of need to be taking damage to be effective in pvp as a warrior.  You have to ask yourself - what's better for my team? Mediocre crowd control or killing the opposing faction?
---
Wait 5 seconds until you can cast again and pummel is on cd, ignore the warrior’s tickles and kill the healer.
---
It is a bad game. The way to win is to play as boring as possible. It is objectively a terrible game. It literally leverages fun against winning.
---
I did a pretty similar thing like 3 month ago. I’m definitely gonna avoid the dress, too.
---
For me it was okay to have Cloth Gloves and also some Mail since it’s also looking like metal Armor.
---
I made a few things different.
---
One item that stands out to me and is almost as good as it’s cloth pendant is
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=15047
---
I love how pallys try to overcome the clothadin trend. We will have to go this road for efficient raid healing, though. But for dungeons I’m trying to avoid it to improve immersion in my class fantasy.
---
It shouldn't be available until then you are correct.
---
Ah okay my bad.
---
Although I still don't think it's worth spending hundreds of gold on leveling tailoring then hundreds of gold on a robe and then dropping tailoring.
---
I’d prefer to pay a higher monthly sub to preserve the integrity of the game tbh. In my opinion there is no point in paying for the game at all if it’s being compromised by bullshit.
---
You need the killing blow to get the shard, and Drain Soul does shitty damage.
---
Now you're just speaking nonsense...
---
But even with pvp in mind, the loss of massive stats from many cloth pieces, wouldn't be worth it.
---
MoP did a lot of great shit. MoP probably introduced the most interesting "new" stuff for the franchise since Classic.
---
Requesting, fine.
---
Requiring, not so much.
---
I'm sure your intentions are good, but I've been in enough random Discords to not want to expose myself to that every time I pug a dungeon. Also, you can pretty easily explain most tactics in a sentence or two in chat.
---
0.5%
---
thats irrelevant to the franchise.
---
Im sorry but you are completely deluded, corporate greed has no ceiling
---
I know what you mean!!! But basically I’m gonna go for hunter or lock, I love the game play plus they are useful over/pvp but I’m more pvp
---
3.5 speed or above = Seal of Command.
---
Below that = Seal of Righteousness.
---
I'm pretty sure you don't, you only need to get the killing blow if you want to get the regen bonus from the improved drain soul talent.
---
Undead horse has the benefit of having the most annoying fucking screech when you summon it.
---
I dunno about paladins as a matchup, but priests can't remove poison and viper's pretty bad against druids. I would imagine paladins aren't too much of a threat since they can't hit your cheetah aspect?
---
Sap, stealth. Speed runs you can pull a pack away for the group to sneak past and then you can vanish. Lots of stuff other than just lockpicking. Expose armor... Lol.
---
&gt; I intend to level as prot paladin
---
Why in the world would you do that?
---
Skinning for cash precludes farming cloth for tailoring
---
Yeah I'll need to be flexible obviously.  If I'm having a really hard time I can maybe negotiate things such as just letting me roll on 1 item or paying people if I win etc.  Hopefully it's not too bad but we'll see.  If it's that hard I can easily just go a hybrid spec and heal but having a 60 feral tank for BRD would make the run go a lot smoother so I'd assume some people would be willing to deal with it.
---
Well, I completely disagree with this. If its a raid setting and the epic is bis then no, not everyone should need. If its something like staff of jordan then sure.
---
If those two philosophies were correct there would be no need to even have need or greed as a system.
---
If need for gold is valid because of the value of an item being universal, then you'd be justified rolling need on everything that ever drops regardless of any circumstance. Which means even having a greed button at all would be redundant.
---
It's clear that greed both by definition of the word and by the icon that represents it is intended for those who want to sell the item. Both philosophies are not correct here.
---
How so? Games don't draw in millions of players daily because they're boring.
---
Looks like you have devilsaur leggings in the foot slot for ret pally on the first 3 tiers (unless there is a new feature where you can wear pants on your feet).
---
I love Bonescythe, but im super bias.
---
When I was one of 3 people on the server with Mongoose I charged 50-100 gold to enchant they brought the mats. Never expected a tip.
---
Google blade of eternal darkness
---
So much crying about layers clogging the google search having trouble finding it at the moment.
---
It's a blue posts, they were explaining layers how they work and went on to explain each server could have 3-9 layers each.
---
Switch to horde and I'll give you my power infusion.
---
Shards do not disappear when you log out, so you farm every slot full of shards before going to raid basically.
---
And as a lock, once you get into a raid you can drain soul a bunch to re-supply. When you are running low, usually part of the raid will be sent to help you get more.
---
There's no need for it, and you can get by with simply marking kill/cc targets (as a tank, you should have those markers keybound so that you can apply them quickly and efficiently. 
---
That said, there's no harm in dropping a friendly message with a discord link if anyone is interested.
---
!! Loved this commercial from them back in the day completely forgot it existed thank you!
---
This would definitely make it more organized!
---
well you must not play fighting games if u think vanilla is "disgustingly bad balance" curious what games you think have worse balance than wow?
---
If you read in this thread, multiple people say that "you need to focus on rep above all else" to even have a shot at being exalted at 60 without cloth turn-ins, from what I can recall from classic, i agree with those folks.
---
The lore is something I want to get into more this time around as well.
---
Dem sweet sweet Mooncloth bags.
---
If a player's only job is being an annoying CC suck, then they aren't very viable.
---
Is it better than Atiesh
---
Shield slam does not do good damage. Nor does it purge a buff. This is classic. Tank skills work to generate aggro not damage.
---
oh contrare, the wow dev team are humans, ergo, owe cows and unrepayable debt
---
Even a Naxx geared prot warrior isn't as good as a druid FC, warriors just don't have anything close to druids heals and travel form.
---
Also another aspect to consider. Someone that logs in once per month (or less), but still pays the subscription still gives the same income to Blizzard as someome that plays 10+ hours a day.
---
To be successful in a sub based games you need to get a lot of players to continue subscribing every month. One good way of doing that is obviously to make a good game that people want to play. But what that means can be vastly different for different players.
---
It worked that way up until it was patched in 1.10.

Slice and Dice - This ability can no longer be blocked, dodged, or parried, and cannot miss. If you attempt to use this ability when your target is dead, you will now receive an error message instead of displaying the spell animations.
---
Devouring plague doesn’t make or break the power of spriest anyway. 
---
My point is you’re literally bitching about every PvP video ever. Get a life.
---
But shadow priests melt faces in pvp
---
IIRC it doesnt reduces damage, it just flat out resists,  hence why nature damage is so bad in vanilla. Tons of mobs have nature resist and none of the major curses/debuffs reduce it.
---
I forgot about this. My favorite vanilla vid ever. Cheers for the nostalgia dude.
---
Not bitching, not on a high horse. Making an observation.
---
There's no reason to be so sensitive about an old pvp video for a videogame. It's not nearly as big of a deal as you seem to want to make it.
---
Nope
---
No, the way to win is to be able to outbuild your opponent, which means being able to build FAST and move FAST. 
---
Compared to PUBG where the way to win is to lay in the grass.
---
You might not like it but Fortnite is objectively much faster paced than every other Battle Royale.
---
There's certainly some value to this list in regards to pvp and to a lesser degree 5mans. For 40man raiding though its horrible and even the more casual guilds will take issue since you will be using HALF the + healing or worse than you should have. You are a paladin, you have divine fcking shield to save yourself every 3 mins.
---
It is. I believe I saw it during the Super Bowl too.
---
&gt; heal dungeons without wearing int gear 
---
Good luck with that
---
I call bullshit, to be honest.

Minmaxing your race/class/talent choices are as easy as typing it into Google. Being actually good at the game is not quite that simple.
---
Yeah it’s strong but only relevant in 2/9 matchups and shares a partial cooldown with insignias which are more universal anyway. It’s a lot better than bow specialization, and looks great on paper, but the applications are limited. When you need it, it’s great to have, but when you don’t it’s just dead weight
---
Yeah absolutely. Rested do isn’t a significant boost like say heirlooms in current wow but let’s say you continually let your character cap rested xp(i think it’s like 2&amp;1/2 levels) then you’re going to save yourself a decent amount of time.
---
In cat form Ive looted mobs that still show combo points on them. I cant use them for anything, but I imagine SnD should be usable.
---
Lol you brought it up
---
1 bubble rested per 8 hours, so you'll have 2.5 bubbles of rested every day when you log in.

Thanks mate, I posted the guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/).

Mate, do you want me to cook you dinner and chew your meals for you as well? Stop being too lazy to google the bloody item.

This.

(There are some others which are like HOJ from paladins is diamond or banish target is the same)

Raids discord required (just for coordination purposes, and staying awake). Dungeons, not even close.

You're welcome, I posted my follow-up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/).
---
I made an observation and then you had a meltdown.
---
I get it, you really like spriest, so do I. Doesn't make a video of almost entirely DP clips any less silly. 
---
It's also nothing to froth at the mouth about. Just relax.
---
&gt;since 
---
That's a good point actually. I'm considering taming Arikara since I have the quest to summon him. 1.7AS cloud serpent without caster stats, that sounds pretty good.
---
Is it ever worth judging crusader?
---
Can you explain what spell batch enrage proccing means?
---
If it's a raid setting then people pay DKP, Loot Council, or roll in PUGs.  If it's UBRS, then always always always, never trust.  BiS too often translates to "My epic mount".
---
It doesn’t seem better than Atiesh

Transmute it yourself and sell the bars, only if the ore is cheaper then the bars, else sell the CD.

Fantastic interview
---
If starting zones are unplayable, I'm gonna be real pissed. We're suffering the pitfalls of layering, so we better get its supposed payoff.
---
Wrath set for warriors, the shark helmet was badass. Even though my warrior never got passed level 55. 
---
Judgement set for Paladins was also a favorite.
---
It didn't develop on private servers; it's virtually always been a thing in WoW.  If a BoE drops in a PuG that is valuable enough to cause forum drama, you roll need.
---
Does it really increase The dmg thet much :O....
---
Thanks 🙏
---
Excellent response. Unfortunately boredom will keep me reading things until release and probably changing my mind more. But I applaud your analysis of my paralysis by analysis.
---
Who says I only have one CC? Who says what class I even am? Who says I'm alone with no support? Who says whether I'm a caster or non-caster? Who says I can't do enough burst dps to shred someone after a CC? 
---
Your assumptions are super bad. Thanks for displaying your ignorance.
---
Thats fair. Ty.
---
If you're playing that little per day you should definitely seek out an inn for rested.
---
Hey man, I did get around to posting a write-up of my macros [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/).
---
In vanilla? No.
---
Mage - Warlock - Paladin 
---
Paralysed indecision.
---
It was absolutely never a thing in my entire vanilla experience, TBC experience, and WotLK experience. I can't speak for other servers, but the first time I was ever exposed to it was pservers.
---
It’s super bis in both pvp and pve. Serious raiding guilds require everyone to be an engineer.
---
Or Buru in AQ20 which is kited (usually by hunter) for the entire fight. And maybe Ossiran too? I can't remember that one. Also the adds on Fankriss in AQ40.
---
You're making we want to play RpP-PvP again. Just a shame all the RP dies after awhile as normies join.
---
By the way, I posted my follow-up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/).
---
Can you pm it to me too!
---
Cash shop mounts! totally P2W!! hue hue.
---
 It has a sub. It's more than enough.
---
When I played Paladin on vanilla I only wore plate, I had no interest in anything else.  I was the only full judgement paladin in our guild.  Was this smart?  Probably not but when I play again I will do the same thing.  We did up to Cthune and 4 or 5 bosses in Naxx and I was ret most of the time so I could have fun in BGs, where I mostly healed anyways.
---
My point is, it doesn't fucking matter, just do what you like.
---
I think its fine as an optional thing. "Hey, do you want to get on discord with us?" sounds alot better than "LFM so and so, DISCORD REQUIRED", which might scare a few people off.
---
I totally forgot about this video hahaha
---
Oh wow ! What about their Mana Regen ?!
---
Tauren starting zone, the biggest bottlenecks are going to be: cougars (along the hills, there are a few pockets where people don't go further away), as well as the named Quilboar (easily skippable) before you hit Bloodhoof.
---
Once you hit Bloodhoof, the next problem spot is the harpies (the lower level ones), and once you make it to the named goblin (5-10 minute respawn).
---
Yikes. A little fail on the white knighting there.
---
Hi, /u/Hefftty
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6n1kw/duel_box_leveling_warrior_and_priest/). 
---
Undead can be holy priest what's the difference
---
It’s about having a shit ton of mana in AoE situations. No matter how good your gear, without gimmicks like this your bottle neck is the time you spend drinking.
---
Another reason blizzard should be creative and release classic+ servers along side the normal ones, but that's where they'd also put new content, and rightfully so.
---
This isn't a fact. Blizzard has a working 1.12 reference client.
---
That is fact.
---
Well, it was a thing on my server.  I still remember the first epic world drop I saw: Zul'Farrak PuG, Gut Ripper dropped, we all rolled need with a Rogue in the group.
---
What phase do thos BS plans become available?
---
Servers are only based on LA and Chicago. Chicago server will server EST and CST, where as LA will serve PST and MTN time.
---
For the Horde!
---
Kill all gnomes on sight quest ... daily ... :P
---
Wand spec first, or spirit tap? Also what is going to be the fastest way to get a wand on launch?
---
I leveled a prot pally in vanilla.  Build a cloth/leather/mail healing set and you can heal anything before ST fine as any spec.
---
The hub in Westfall has an Inn and a flight path to Stormwind.  As a druid, you would probably hearth back and forth from the Inn to Moonglade for training.  Other errands you could do in Stormwind (which also has a druid trainer).  Level 12 is when I start Westfall, though 10 should be fine, especially with friends.
---
Yep, that's possible, just takes some extra time.
---
So right...... if cows can be in WoW, pandas are just as legitimate.
---
For most BoE rares the second argument comes with a huge caveat though, it's usually not an item you'll hang on to for very long. So using it as an upgrade for a day or two instead of turning it into a good chunk of gold comes off as quite a waste.
---
You really don’t need goblin if you have an alt or a few guildmates. They will just create hundreds of sappers at once.
---
I went into enemy low level zones and would fear people leveling into more and more mobs so they would take durability damage. A priest friend would come with and mind control them into mobs as well. We would then watch the low lvl try to fight 3-5 mobs by itself. 
---
Good times.
---
Rogue helps others with ethical surprise mechanics
---
TYVM.  This is exactly what i wanted.
---
Why? They need the resources to build their barricades against the legion which is already in that eastern part and north.
---
You will have zero issues getting into a raid as shaman.
---
Flippy jump &gt; Fear Ward imo.
---
Lol nah I’ve never even played spriest. I’m just bored at work. 
---
But for someone who doesn’t think it’s a big deal you took the time to point it out and then argue with me about it. Goes both ways haha
---
I second this
---
Idk for me its pretty easy warlock. Tbh i just went on an instant 60 server and went a few bgs with each class. There were ones i just couldnt stand. I liked warrior but i tried an 1-15 lvling with it and it was fucking boring and i felt so weak which is just immersion breaking. On the other hand warlock is a pretty smooth leveler and a joy to play on bgs
---
It was pretty common knowledge in classic that Warriors were generally threat capped moreso than other dps classes (other than warlock).  
---
The value of being a rogue is being able to vanish to rest aggro table while still doing great dps. 
---
We'll see if the pserver meta holds up where warriors are "dw fury tanking," and we'll see how threat is with 10% higher parry and 1% higher dodge for raid bosses.
---
Duel Box Leveling - Warrior and Priest - Viable? 
---
So my thought is this:
---
Warriors are challenging to level due to downtime and their fragility if they pull more than a few mobs. However, they do really well with a pocket healer. What if I was my own pocket healer? If I start another account and play a priest on it and follow myself around the whole game healing myself, is that a viable strategy?
---
Pros:
---
1. It is unlikely I die on the warrior with a healer
---
2. I get double the amount of trade skills to play with at 60 possibly opening a profession shuffle play
---
3. I get an alt to play along with my main
---
4. I'm less likely to get ganked with 2 characters leveling "solo"
---
Cons:
---
1. It will be a pain in the ass switching either between screens (I don't think Classic has windowed mode) by alt tabbing or using a laptop.
---
2. It may be slower to complete gather quests due to having to loot on both characters. (thinking free for all loot and only loot on warrior)
---
3. There is no /follow as of right now
---
4. Double mount costs, double training costs ect.
---
I know a lot of you have tons of experience on private servers ect. Is this viable? Does anyone have any strategies to improve on this? Could I tank and heal dungeons at the same time? Thank you in advance.
---
Then it's Greed. That's why you can roll for either.
---
The entirety of time I played WoW it's always worked this way. Needing on an item for greed is a ninja move.
---
Don't be a dick.
---
That's not nature damage but rather binary spells (aka spells that either resist or hit; that can't partially resist), and most nature spells aren't binary and would be able to partially resist.
---
A binary spell is a spell like Frostbolt, that has a damage component and a non-damage component that is either fully resisted or not resisted at all. 
---
Fireball/Shadow Bolt are purely damaging spells, and as such are non-binary and can partially resist.
---
No issue with someone rolling need on a BOE if they equip it.
---
You and i sir are going to get along well
---
Imagine being attacked by a player, pressing one button that pushes your health to full, and watching them run away as they realize fighting you isn’t going to get them anywhere.
---
Henry Cavill (Superman) almost ignored the callback for the role because he was raid healing
---
Yea, but did they have phones?
---
Honestly don't worry about it. Tanks and healers are going to be your holdup for pugs. And I'd honestly be surprised if pugs make it past MC, Ony and ZG. BWL pugs are almost unheard of because of the coordination for first two bosses.
---
There will be plenty of Ony MC and ZG groups running in chat. Especially ZG with the timer reset.
---
So far what ive done is grind as soon as i create character and move towards battleboars to kill level 4's asap, when I hit lvl 4 I hearth, grab Battleshout and Charge and move onto bloodhoof village. About 20 min in now, I grab "Sharing The Land" (kill quest) , grab skinning, and start killing level 5-6 wolves. next at level 5 or 6 10 min later I go back to bloodhoof grab other kill quests and sell my skinned leathers for a weapon upgrade from vendor for 6 silver.   
---
Hopefulyl this is enough to get past the bottlenecks and I can start bloodhoof quests at level 4 or 5
---
There is big difference in speed between 40 and 60, you save so much time, not only that you make more gold getting it.
---
Yes.
---
It's still a slowdown 1-10 because other classes have trainers in Goldshire/Kharanos where you have to run all the way to Stormwind to level up, and because you have to go back to Kalimdor to do your class quests.
---
I don’t think it’s a problem. It’s a BoE that can be sold for a high value. Roll need.
---
Good point
---
So why is it different in your mind if its a low value?
---
That's not what I'm implying no.
---
I wish I could have TBC's balance injected into vanilla.  We honestly "could" but nochangers will shit the bed if somedbody dare suggest any sort of balancing.
---
I find it really amusing though because classic back in the day WAS in a state of contant change and rebalancing for its run, so if they were truly NOCHANGE then they would embrace balance patches that retuned classes here and there so that classes were in a state of flux and not static.  Have static, never changing balance actually isn't an authentic vanilla experience.  :P
---
I mean he did not put on lipstick. That being said, he is right though.
---
why is that bannable?
---
I'm rolling a tank and it would be nice this time around when doing dungeons to always have voice chat but you are correct, it's not needed. All you need to do as a tank is keybind your markings and off you go. Mark up skull, X and Moon, keep up the pace until healer mana i low, wait for them to drink to 75% mana or so and begin pulling again while they finish up filling the last of their mana. And on it goes. Not rocket science exactly. Would be more fun with voice though.
---
I think I've settled on maining a Hunter for classic, but I'm still uncertain if it's really my favourite playstyle. I'll probably be taking my hunter through early raids for sure, but I'd like to raid as another class eventually, using the Hunter to funnel gold into my alt. I'm really torn between a few different choices now:
---
Shadow Priest
---
Pros: Special snowflake, feels like I'm helping if we have lots of Locks, force to be reckoned with in PvP, Anathema looks ballin
---
Cons: Meme spec, forced into Holy, dumpster DPS in early raid content
---
Rogue
---
Pros: I get prio on my favorite-looking gear, infinite CC, big dick DPS
---
Cons: Overpopulation, gear competition, doesn't feel very remarkable
---
Fury Warrior
---
Pros: Prio on more cool gear, I really like how the rotation feels, biggest dick DPS
---
Cons: I'm not a confident tank, gear competition, I have nobody to healbot/level with me, I'm impatient
---
Pros: edgy boi, Alliance, cool looking caster gear, great support options, free mount!
---
Cons: 1-button rotation, Bloodvine and Plagueheart look nasty to me, bad early DPS
---
Retribution Paladin
---
Pros: Judgement Armor, special snowflake, maybe get some cool stuff on farm runs?
---
Cons: Literally everything else, worst spec in the game
---
One thing you might not know is that games companies of today not only make profits in subscription models / upfront payments / microtransactions but alot of profit is in gray areas. Once you go so big as blizzard you just bank your money on cayman islands, never pay taxes for anything ; do not worry about the oh so small blizzard , putting classic on their portfolio is the equivalent of buying a coke for bill gates. 
---
Oh and by the way - the blizzard clients logs all your keystrokes, just like facebook and google apple and co. they are selling your data. There is more profit in data than selling the actual game itself.
---
Yeah this is pretty much everything pulling me to Lock. It's just the whole healing, team helping, immune to rogues part pulling me to holy pally.
---
If all items were BoE yes, but they are not. A BoP item obviously has more value as a gear upgrade than it has to someone selling it, as you can't sell it on AH.
---
Keep me coming! These are great.
---
Once the group is full, you can casually mention "me and the healer are chilling on discord, feel free to join." Anything past that is a bit too much.
---
Ant good and reliable healer is always needed, a paladin that knows his place aka high output and no complaining about having to buff (ye you get those) with good attendance can always find a high tier guild.
---
You'd roll paladin if you want steady but simplified healing, don't have to worry about mana as much, don't have to worry about consumables as much. Yes it might be slacky reasons but they are for most who play paladin good reasons, liking the 'spammy' healingstyle a lot more than trying to regen mana all the time. And this is not to say a paladin only spams the tank, you can snipe those priest renews on your raidmembers easily ;) You bascically never stop casting, for some that's annoying, for others it makes the raids more engaging.
---
Vanilla paladin often reminds me of my WotLK holy priest a bit, in a sense that no manaworries and just spamming heals on ppl was worryfree and just felt 'smooth'.
---
You'll also roll pala only if you do not mind buffing people every 15min (or most of the time every ~6/7min as you don't want to rebuff midfight etc). While buffing is part of the game palypower makes this even easier than mage buffing to me. Buffing as a mage/priest is more annoying since it makes you totally oom, as a paladin you simply click palypower a bit and continue your run, no big deal.
---
Sometimes you'd be 'sacrificed' to be the nightfall-bitch, meleeying easy bosses to get nightfall procs up for casters, but that depends on the guild, dispelling some fights like viscidus only means your nights have at least a BIT of variation, who cares.
---
Paladins are pretty versatile if you think about it. Support for the raid yes, but they can hold their own just fine healingwise. Output is  so incredibly high you are the layer that other healers built upon, quick heals to always have tank health steady and fast enough fol/holy shocks to actually save low people combined with a priest shield. Also tools for the raid, knowing when to BOP mages/locks and when to save that cooldown. a 2min armor buff (tied to LoH) for stuff like patchwerk or chromaggus, frost/fire/conc aura alternating per boss etc.
---
I've raided both sides in recent years and alliance healing felt 100% more stable in every situation....bar goblin trash in BWL, which is I guess too much spread damage. Even sapphiron was easier on ally, freeing up druids/priests more for raidhealing as tankhealing was safe + frost resist aura.
---
What a shaman brings in grouphealing is mostly always covered fully by priest/druids on ally side. What a paladin brings in tankhealing is imo barely covered as well by priests/druids on horde side, making it more dodgy.
---
The BWL trinket gives you a 'burst' cooldown, spamming holy lights on the raid/tanks. Output through the roof. Extremely strong.
---
DI gives you wipe protection and even ninjapull protection. Do you see that fool backpeddling towards a patrol in the middle of fighting a tough pack in AQ40? The moment he pulls you suicide DI him, and the raid will worship you. I saved a 'speedrun' like this before, think outside of the box.
---
Put on righteous fury and have mobs not go for squishy priests but for you as a paladin, [stabilizing the raid and not having 4 priests die](https://plays.tv/video/5a7d095a12d832f860/ez-pala-tank?from=user) when something goes wrong. (hence you always wear a shield as pala)

We don't know but It will be either P1 or P2 at the latest since they were both available drops at the launch of Vanilla if I remember correctly.
---
They are frighteningly rare drops though some well established servers in the Peak of Vanilla might only have had 10 or less people who could craft either of the plan's.
---
And then you get servers like Blackwing Lair where literally everyone had the both plans cause why the hell not.
---
&gt;objectively
---
I dont think this means what you think it means
---
I think the part that will get you banned is pretending to want to buy something you are selling.
---
Warlock, Mage, and Rogue. Change my mind. I know the least played class is warlock. But is it that different than a mage? How do warlocks scale in PvP compared to mages? And how is the dps difference? Leveling time between the 3? Change my mind!
---
&gt; Druids and Paladins feel outclassed nearly entirely in PvE
---
People who say this, have never played a druid.
---
Meters don't mean shit, I can go anywhere I like. LIKE INTO THE AUCTION HOUSE IN STORMWIND AND KILL THE AUCTIONEERS THEN BOOK IT FOR THE MOAT, AND AQUATIC FORM UNTIL COMBAT DROPS AND STEALTH BACK IN AND DO IT AGAIN 5 MINUTES LATER!
---
*ahem* ...
---
Druids aren't the best at anything, they are GREAT at a lot of things. Healing? Got you. Tanking 5 mans? Sure. (And some trash mobs in raids/some bosses in raids) Go solo this elite quest? Sure thing. Be the bane of everyone's existence in OWPvP? Yep.
---
I don't care about DPS meters, I don't need to be the main tank getting funneled everything 24/7/365. I want to be able to do what I want to do in the game - explore, have fun, hang out with people, and cover my claws in the blood of my enemies who look at me funny.
---
holy pallys are the best tank healers and with the correct gear they get nearly unlimited mana as all of there crit heals get refunded
---
Darkshore is the best zone to go to when you’ve done the starter zones as Alliance anyways, it is very smooth up until about 16, when you’ve probably started thinking of rotating to Westfall for Deadmines quests anyways.
---
&gt;You  are moving the goalposts. Your claim: Shadow Protection potions are not  used until Naxxramas. My counterpoint: they are used on Nefarian. Your  opinion of "how" or "who" should use them is *entirely* guesswork and there is no reason to lay the foundation of a gold making guide on such guesswork.
---
I did progression raiding from the end of MC and the entirety of Nax in a high-end guild in vanilla, Shadow Protection potions were not even remotely required for Nefarian, though you had plenty of time to bandage up if you wanted to help out the healers during the transition. Heck, you could dodge the transition breath altogether in the little rooms where the adds spawn and get away with not using an Onyxia cloak if you wanted.
---
It wasn't a particularly demanding fight once you worked out Phase 1.
---
Lol sure
---
Indeed. I'll probably level an alt to 35 for a second mooncloth cool down and once I have the 10 I need for truefaith robes, I'm going to be a mooncloth bag factory!
---
She has been my celebrity crush since I was 14.. now I love her even more
---
Beast Mastery talent point 21. "Intimidation" This is an instant cast 3 second stun. Not necessarily a pet ability but a hunter ability that the pet triggers.
---
Whoa whoa whoa. More value how exactly? How do you go about determining where the magical line for this value is?
---
Your argument was that gold was universal as a value, not that it has to be a certain amount of gold. If you want to say it has to be a certain amount then the philosophy completely falls apart because value is relative.
---
Naw. It's not cringey
---
I'm really enjoying these and the others. Awesome!
---
Just want to say how much I love these posts. It'd be awesome if you included a little more write-up around them too.
---
I mean if you are ok with gimping yourself
---
They're not just big, they have a jiggle animation that was later removed. Other races have it too but it's only really noticeable on dwarf females.
---
^ this guy has no idea what he’s talking about
---
You’re wrong. Roll need.
---
Tailoring is p much required for BiS, then i would take something like herb or mining
---
YES. It was amazing. She got Sean to suck milk into his nose... Perfection!
---
You're wrong. See I can comment meaningless bollocks too.
---
Killing level 4's at level 1 might be decent, the biggest downfall is going to be how much damage you are taking.
---
As you are a warrior, might be rough.
---
The first few quests - first is a humble request, super easy, and the plainstriders are decent enough quantity you just need to move around a bit - aren't terrible.
---
But should be interesting though.
---
If payed cosmetic anything ever makes it to classic I truly hope the community comes together to viciously mock and shame every dumbass that purchases them. 
---
And then I hope whatever private server thats datamined the classic sow values and has properly implemented them grows in popularity, and is hosted in a country that can freely tell Blizz to fuck off when the C&amp;D arrives.
---
Congrats. You win the day. I’ll still roll need.
---
Only if you can buy the mounts that you'd otherwise have to farm for. Who cares if a dude buys a mount; it supports the game I enjoy and doesn't dilute my experience.
---
No furries
---
And for anyone like me you'd be blacklisted for it.
---
Reckadin mate! So much fun to whack people with full reck stacks.
---
Skinning and tailoring. At 60 when you have enough gold drop skinning for engineering. When you have crazy raid gear, drop tailoring for something else.
---
if you want to be raid viable plan on going deep holy lol
---
Back in vanilla, i was an herbalist and alchemist, but i'm thinking this time around i'm going to do herbalism and tailoring on my mage. it seems to be the best option from what i hear
---
Your a child to think they were “dogshit”
---
I was in a kt killing guild in retail, I was an average player in a guild full of elite players much better than me, hulk smash orc warrior from pvp video was in my guild along with many other great players that knew their class inside and out and spent a lot of time on elitist jerks forum, which ion hazzikostas created. 
---
Everyone knew their BiS except and the rotation consisted of 2-3 buttons. 
---
Trust me you are not better than hulksmash.
---
The warriors in my guild only started to become godlike around patchwerk.
---
Mc, bwl and aq the dps is more spread out.
---
What about pvp ?! Are they as good for wpvp ?
---
you will need healing gear

I'm going healer myself but very much want to make a rogue alt because of the fun gameplay and more variety with talwnts than warriors.
---
Yea, I agree with that. I don't want the pets/cosmetics/mounts in classic to be apart of any store ever.  That is a VERY big aspect of community play. If you see someone with the Scarab Lord mount and title, you know what to expect with that guy. Likewise with other rare farm mounts and such. I think that's too impactful to the community.
---
The rank 10 set is extremely good. For PVP, much of the gear is BiS until at least ZG or BWL.
---
It's not expensive at all, but remember as a mage you do not have to farm the mats yourself as you can earn more gold an hour than you could gather the same value of cloth in an hour.
---
I currently have a lvl59 priest who has tailoring at 280  but still have 200g banked just from levelling.
---
He was there at the start of vanilla.
---
I can't remember if he was relocated or removed altogether when Dr Weavil moved in though.
---
W-what's to the north of it?
---
What I’m getting from this - you’re pulling these selections out of your ass without running numbers or conclusive testing and I should avoid these useless guides that are clearly just intended to draw in traffic to your site. 
---
I’ll stick to guides backed up by data and simulations run by theorycrafters, thanks.
---
That's an interesting take on priests.
---
I was leaning towards undead priest as I figured out I wouldn't be as gear depended and still be highly sought after which would allow me to raid even if my playing time will be limited.
---
Now that I think about it. Wow is the only game that you are forced to pour constant money on hit to be able to actually play. And on top of that there is all the cosmetic market.
---
Idk how Riot manages to handle their game so well and keep it all free.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
More of a modern wow thing since DPS meters became more mainstream. People get really competitive.
---
Way back when, we didn't have meters. We didn't care as long as stuff died.
---
We were all too busy trying to figure out what our spells DID half the time to know what was "MOST EFFECTIVE"
---
Toss up between engineering/mining and alchemy/herb. Both are good for different reasons but they are your best options. Vanish jumper cables has saved many a wipe. 
---
Find a guild early as rogues and warriors will probably be the least recruited later on as they will be played heavily. Expect competition for raid spots. 
---
Expect to still have to respec for PVP and PVE unless you get good swords. Daggers is way more fun though IMO. Big boy ambush crits are awesome. 
---
Make friends with a few healers in raids. I used to keep rogues in my raids topped off on fights like Golemagg to help them stay up on Meters as a paladin. Shhhh don’t tell my Tanks... heh. 
---
Getting to hit cap as soon as possible should be your first goal at 60. 
---
Practice your stun lock rotation. The better you are at it the better you will be in PVP.
---
Fast off hand for poison procs . Slow main hand for ability damage. 
---
First aid is your best friend. Blind, bandage, stealth is OP as hell. 
---
Level your lock picking as you go. You will want it in dungeons as you level. 
---
5 man stealth runs are really fun. If you ever want to really feel like a rogue try it. Bring some druids if you aren’t feeling brave heh. 5 rogues is super fun. 
---
Pick pocket macros are awesome.
---
Yuck, new reddit and no ad block. Youre doing the internet wrong.
---
Most levels blues have their price lowered due to only being useful for few levels. Unless if the items are used for twinking, in which case you should definitely roll for money instead of equipping.
---
Im an orc i love orcs
---
Definitely true and a good thing to keep in mind. Keeping that person who only can log on once or twice a week entertained is just as important as keeping that rank 14 player entertained.
---
Would you think then it would be a waste of time going at 1 to Teldrassil and just worry about it later at 60 once you’ve gotten a lot of rep for all the factions?  
---
I’m rolling priest and do plan on grinding FA to 300 (and later, tailoring for Truefaith) so cloth will be a pita for me.
---
Their regen is based on the talent Illumination in the Holy tree. When they crit with Holy Light or Flash of Light, they get 100% of the base mana cost of the spell back for free. Once you get a good amount of crit you can just go forever. Just like other healers you'll also use downranking to help conserve mana, especially in earlier gear levels, but they don't really rely on standard regen via Spirit or Mp5.
---
yes if you want to tank go warrior
---
Looks like low level gear (Whitemane's head)
---
So makes sense SPriest to level.
---
Wait, where's Pandaria?
---
well I can't find it so I can't defend against it..
---
There is just so much content about layering, I just can't find the right combination of filters to find it again.
---
Really? Tell me. Tell me everything.
---
&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0qwqy/if_youre_getting_sick_of_these_dont_worry_this_is/
---
Much appreciated.  This is the kind of info that can take a so called meme class to omfg how did they do that?!
---
I wouldn't do it on a blue unless I know it's an extremely valuable one like for twinks or whatever. If an epic world drop like Edgemaster's drops then I'm 100% gonna roll need. These items go for well over a thousand gold, that's beyond who "needs" it most.
---
Only raiding spec
---
Please but some kind of Border or Something around your next Post of that Kind.
---
My brain melted trying to understand what was going on and I spent a good 5 minutes trying to Not click on the picture but the comment button
---
Awesome, thanks for letting me know! I’ll go have a read.
---
Get full T2 judgment gear set and do end game raids. By the time I got 60 BC was in full effect so no one was doing vanilla raids anymore.
---
Wat?
---
How can you not understand that a BoE item has full value for all players, but a BoP item is more valuable to the player that can actually use it, than it has to people vendoring?
---
Are you like disabled or something?
---
Core game mechanic is to play as defensively and passively as possible.
---
I think you don't know what objectively means.
---
Justin Biebers "baby" is objectively a bad song. Its lyrics beat and Melody are all watered down derivative drivel.
---
Objectively bad is not antonymous to successful or popular.
---
Thanks half my pizza is now on my shirt from the fucking laugh this gave me.
---
Just saying. You used one of your CCs on a tank that's distributing. That's one CC not used on a damage dealer.
---
I never assumed anything you just clearly missed the point that any amount of Damage, CC, global cooldown used on a Prot Warrior is better for them than you using it on their allies.
---
Tailoring isn't needed until Phase 3 I think.  Until then, it's not as good as others.
---
makes sense
---
tailoring because you know....cloth, and herbalism just because it's really good for gold farming. if you want though, herbalism and alchemy are a perfect duo because they go hand in hand with each other.
---
You can basically heal 5-mans as offspec, they aren't THAT painful as long as you know what you are doing.
---
I’m pretty sure I’m going to achieve even less this time around
---
Warlock isn't as good at the higher damage AOE packs, but they can solo farm several DM N bosses. Mol'dar, slip'kik, and the king are all warlock soloable. Better gold per hour to kill bosses than trash anyway.
---
To echo this, mana pool is going to suffer greatly without int gear (unfortunately) so drinking after every pull, not going to be that effective.
---
&gt;felt so weak which is just immersion breaking
---
That's an accurate depiction of a warrior. Sure a Marine rifleman is great at breaking and killing things...when they have food/fuel/bullets to support them. But just by themselves they're not going to destroy all the things.
---
they are probably the best PvP healers as they are durable and have a good deal of "oh shit" buttons
---
i would leave any run that forced voice chat.  last thing i want to do is awkwardly listen to spergs for 2 hours
---
Fully erect?
---
Typing words is not the same as getting upset.
---
Me replying to you getting upset does not make me upset. This isn't an "I'm rubber and your glue" situation lmao.
---
lmao he just refuted all your silly stereotypes, he wasnt smugly bragging, you are the one that brought it up. I could say the same thing and it holds no less merit. Sounds like a typical alliance player to smugly push their glasses up and say 'well actually'. you sound like a soyboy who got ganked in redridge too many times. Cant wait to camp you on classic until you log out.
---
They have one that is fucking Chuck Norris
---
Shield Slam doesn't purge a buff? It says so right in the skill on the Classic talent calculator.
---
It doesn't do good damage? I guess the videos of Shield Slam Crit montages are just hackers then.
---
It doesn't do more than MS or BT but it does enough to draw the attention of a caster or healer you just popped it on. You aren't ignorable as Prot despite what people think.
---
no it is not.
---
If that's the case, they probably just need a better weapon. For Horde, go get the lvl 13 RFC quest reward from Thrall.
---
Robe of the Archmage is BiS in Phase 1, it is common to have tailoring for that and dropping it for something else once you’ve got it, and then getting it again for Bloodvine when that comes out in Phase 4.
---
Tim Duncan and a bunch of NBA players were into it back in the day
---
I love this so much, don't you dare stop!
---
Ahh gotcha!
---
The nature of Classic WoW means that they can't use the MTX syustem used in retail; it's antithetical to the whole Classic thing.
---
IMO, they'll further monetize it (because it's already monetized via subs) with content expansions.  Mini-expansions, if you will, that add new zones, dungeons, raids, etc., that fit within the Classic motif.
---
And I'd be perfectly fine with that.
---
Why not do a wow-style trivia over discord?
---
As a mage you do not need professions to make gold. You have faster options. I would go with the best ole stand by. Engineering because it's baller as fuck and, Enchanting because it is also baller as fuck.
---
Nailed it
---
From what I've seen it looks a bit over-tuned. I personally am fine with the concept of artificially recreating how the old game felt if they reel it back a bit
---
What?
---
I &lt;3 Thunder Bluff
---
CHINA WILL GROW LARGER
---
Hmm, that's awesome.
---
Watching Esfand lvl his palladin. He seemed to have much less difficulty leveling and handling extra pulls, sounds much less painful than lvling a priest 
---
Thanks guys. I think I will level a palladin then !
---
if someone needs a BoE and is legitimately going to equip it then it's fine. If they are taking it to sell on the Ah it's not fine. I play on Netherwing and people are pretty retarded, needing on gems and shit because they're a JCer when in reality those things are all free roll because of their AH value. Same with Aldor/Scryer rep shit.
---
Rogues and Warlocks usually sat at the top of our damage meters.
---
With an enhance resto hybrid you'll be healing but you will have imp str and wf totems so just make sure you mention that so that you are put in a melee grp.
---
Stop making up random numbers to support your fear mongering.
---
So I've been wondering this for awhile because I honestly don't even remember how purge acted in regards to a crap ton of buffs. 
---
Does purge remove buffs that have been cast most recently? Or ones that were cast first (less recently?)
---
Ur trippin cuh
---
The freaking NINJA DRAGON IN SWAMP OF SORROWS! (the name is Somnus and he's a JERK, always appears behind you and RAWR you have died.)
---
In Wrath, they took away the texture between classes by buffing a bunch of classes/specs. But at least the classes mostly retained their identities.
---
Cata is when they started pruning abilities and totally redesigning classes.
---
&gt;How can you not understand that a BoE item has full value for all players, but a BoP item is more valuable to the player that can actually use it, than it has to people vendoring?
---
Define "full value" 
---
&gt;but a BoP item is more valuable to the player that can actually use it, than it has to people vendoring
---
Again, define this value.
---
It could well be that I can make far more use of 3g than you could of a 1 stam upgrade.
---
It's definitely cringey at times, but endearing. Like people that don't grow out of their goth phase.
---
i always go it to make ym own robe of archmage, but ye I think bloodvine vest is the first you neeed it
---
Who said that's their only job.
---
Not just CCs, any form of skills/GCD useage.
---
If you're attack the tank, that's damage going to someone meant to take it opposed to someone that isn't.
---
Define viable? Is viable to you only being able to deal massive amounts of damage? Because if that's all you can do the you're just as unviable as a CC suck.
---
Cool you blew up one person, now you're out of Mana and a free target. Even damage dealers can be unviable in PvP. It isn't all about the damage you deal, it's a combination of factors including damage and wasting your opponents attacks/gcds.
---
You should at least put up your corruption for night fall procs
---
Sap on the ZG Tiger boss. Stun on Battleguard Sartura and Fankriss adds. Good luck doing Prophet without rogues for Kick. Suppression Room. And I'm not even getting into the trash packs that are brutal without stunlocks.
---
Your brush is too broad.
---
Planning on doing skinning / herb / alch
---
those comments are fucking brutal lol
---
Name/faction change is definitely a big negative when it comes to server reputation. People may be a lot less likely to ninja or be an asshole when there's no way to fix your reputation outside of leveling a new character.
---
But I had read that Engineering can take quite a lot of gold to make more gold ?
---
As a former warlock, i endorse this statement 100%.  I used to fear people and laugh as they went speeding away like a looney tunes cartoon.
---
Detect traps!
---
You can use invisibility potions
---
Check this out

---
Except it's not, need is still need. Greed is still greed.  
---
You can't go beyond greed because the amount is higher, it's still greed. Especially something like Edgemaster's which is literally BiS for the whole game.
---
I don't understand why people think Prot tickles. They don't hit like a truck but you're just ignorant if you think they are tickles and basically a hunters pet.
---
Mindsets like yours is why I excel so well in PvP on Prot/Blood spec on my Warrior/DK.
---
Give me that Axe off Nef and let me loose on you in a BG and tell me I tickle in Prot lol
---
Playing. I started in TBC.
---
Oh I agree completely in that regard a faster mount does actually increase a players income substantally but I doubt the grand majority of the playerbase will place their priority on acquiring their mounts.
---
The Hardcore playerbase will power through to their epic mounts as fast as they will be able too but after them it will be alot of 60% movespeed mounts for everyone else for a long period of time.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXeyYdGoLCU) one is more fitting for my situation.
---
Also, what would be the "faster options"?
---
BROKEN TOOTH (1.0 attack speed)
---
BOAR (Charge to quickly close gap)
---
WOLVE (PvE attack boost)
---
There are some more that have cool debuff abilities like owls, scorpions.
---
There is one wind serpent that uses focus and can do lightning, that if they relaunch TBC might be useful.
---
Broken tooth's attack speed is great for the added annoyance to casters.
---
Keep in mind pets do not have the same attack speed.  Broken tooth is the fastest, I believe the next are some 1.2 cats.
---
Although 4chan leaks aren't reliable, the leak said that BC and WOTLK servers are coming, and that 10.0 (9.0 is the expansion after BFA) will be led by whichever team they deem to be more profitable for Blizzard, either the current retail team or the Classic team.
---
Yeah pallys are pretty amazing, only bad part is the slooooow lvling
---
Better than doing 0 healing because a rogue got to blow you up like any other clothie
---
It may be difficult to get spots in 5 mans when presenting as an off-tank/off-heals combo.  One of your off-specs really needs to do serious dps to take a slot in a 5 man. Unless geared guildies are willing to carry you through dungeons, as your two chosen specs arent useful for the majority of pulls.
---
Now for raiding, an off-tank that can truly heal when not off-tanking sounds great!
---
Youll be blacklisting ypur whole party a lot then.
---
Is swirly ball coming back?!
---
You’re saying that Garrosh was a good part of the wow lore? How about warlords? Sylvanas burning teldrassil? Oh how about Arthas’s sister conveniently introducing lightbound undead?
---
Exactly, once they're geared sufficiently, paladins are a completely broken class. Best ally healer by far. Their other specs aren't quite as amazing, but that's the balance. One OP spec, two meh specs.
---
I would swap hibernate and natures grasp.
---
Logic is you can't travel or grasp indoors, while you typically hibernate abolish or faerie fire abolish consecutively against hunter and rogue.
---
I like to hit the same key rather than play DDR with my fingers.
---
Alright, what's worse than bring a ret pally, a boomkin, a shadow and a feral with you? Make your raid wait even longer for a few dps spots just because you want to min/ max all aspects of the game.
---
Play the class you enjoy the most, especially if you just want to play casually.
---
Agreed.
---
engineering isn't for making money, its for using it because its awesome
---
Wbuffs are very overpowered. Probably a big reason why your old guild was a huge failure
---
Start by watching world of roguecraft!
---
Edgies arent bis for whole game. And everyone needs gold. I need gold for my mount more than you need some blue boe that drops in Mara abd usbt even prebis for you.
---
&gt; Shield Slam doesn't purge a buff? It says so right in the skill on the Classic talent calculator.
---
Holy shit dude I don't remember it doing that but, your right. Fuck man how did I play a warrior for 2 years and not notice that... Maybe it's because I've never been tank spec.
---
"It doesn't do good damage? I guess the videos of Shield Slam Crit montages are just hackers then."
---
I am sure it does "good damage" but it needs to do as much as BT or MS. The reason is pretty much the same as why 2 handers are preferred in pvp. You generally don't get a lot of face time on players. So you need to deal maximum damage in a short time to actually kill someone.
---
I am sure you can beat some people of a prot warrior in pvp. You get enough epic level gear and you can pretty much make anything work. That being said. It's not generally considered viable because, one heal can undo way too much work. If theres no healers a foot. I am sure you can prolly beat melee classes. Casters though are going to end your life.
---
I think your mistake was making "some guy" a vice GM just because they asked.
---
drop it then relearn it?  that's dumb
---
Not a scam exactly, but still a great money-making scheme for me.
---
I played on quite a small, almost "backwards" EU server. We were all noobs, and nobody knew anything compared to how it is today with the min-maxing and easily available knowledge of the wikis.
---
I was the first alliance player to discover deviate fish and what they could do to your character. I hired a bunch of trusted friends to help me fish them in the barrens, and we would literally stand on the bridge of IF, have one person eat them or their cooked version, and act as a display model. People went absolutely NUTS for them. They'd never seen anything like it. We were shifting them for about 1g per fish, and had huge queues of people waiting at the ironforge bridge to buy direct - we never listed them on the AH, to keep them rare. We lasted about 2-3 weeks before other people finally figured out where these fish came from!
---
Yes, Pandaren first appeared as a Blizzard april fool's joke.
---
But that was *before* they put Chen Stormsnout in Orc Bonus Campaign in The Frozen Throne. AFAIK The Founding of Durotar campaign featuring Rexxar and Chen was official lore from the beginning.
---
This, ele shaman is viable depending on fight length. The shorter the fight, the stronger they are. Because of this, you actually see more of them in hardcore guilds where the speedkills work to their advantage.
---
You nuts?
---
AV was always Alliance favored, for firstly, the start point for alliance is much easier straight shot to the horde relief hut (which has basically no NPC's around it besides the flag guards), while horde have to worry about running by the blacksmiths, potentially aggroing the stables and various other npc's nearby. On top of this horde has to get across the BRIDGE, which can be held by a handful of mages against the entire horde 40 man RAID. AV is VASTLY alliance favored.
---
As for number of melee races and classes, it all comes down to racial abilities. Horde do have better pvp racials (will of the forsaken, stun resist orc racial, zerking, etc), something has to be said about how strong paladins are in pvp as healers. 
---
Between blessing of freedom, self bubble, blessing of protections, they are far and away better pvp healers than shamans, and they are far better pvp healers than any other class in the game it's not even close.
---
Ele shamans do gain power and prowess during BWL era and beyond, to the point they can potentially 1-shot people with chain lightning and trinket procs (not uncommon to see 5k chain lightnings on a very geared ele shaman with a trinket up) They are more offensive than defensive. (Not saying a paladin can't reckoning bomb someone for a 1-shot)
---
Alliance aren't gimped in any way. AV was always alliance dominated.
---
Shadow priest in vanilla isnt really a thing, its worth to give you loot over any other caster when it comes to damage. Even if you are in the raid to buff the warlocks thats all you will do, rest of your talents will be invested in to healing and when you are not keeping the buff upp you are healing.
---
Are you really trying to argue that Alliance have it harder in AV.......................
---
This is how min/maxing works, in engineering it is common to learn it twice to get the gnomish bops first and then go goblin
---
Lol there's been a 43 night elf hunter named Cranberries on a certain pserver camping hillsbrad for nearly a week straight. He would go so far out of his way to find my group, kill us and use the furblog wand, then proceed to tbag us repeatedly, I think one time he did it for 3-4 minutes straight before I finally released spirit. This dude wouldn't quit but I was lvl 29 and I'm now 36 so soon, very soon I will be camping this fucker dispensing sweet sweet justice. 
---
I level with a buddy alot I NEVER go 2v1 against a random Alli, me and my buddies always let it just be a good 1v1 and move on or just leave the little bugar alone, however when I'm solo I've rarely been returned the favor. 
---
Alliance can be so damn vindicitive.
---
#NoChanges
---
&gt;Edgies arent bis for whole game.
---
Yes they are. 
---
&gt;And everyone needs gold. I need gold for my mount more than you need some blue boe that drops in Mara abd usbt even prebis for you.
---
Ok, that applies to vendoring too then according to your logic.
---
Well engineering is never bad, its just so very useful 
---
Alchemy and herblism is a fine and very mageie combo 
---
tailoring is good, you can make bags and a few pieces of good gear
---
I see that point, but I'm still gonna roll need on it since it's such a rare item and the gold from that item can buy 5-6 BiS pieces for my warlock if not more. I also won't be mad if a warrior needs on Staff of Jordan. When the value of the item far outweighs its stat value then I say just need on it.
---
Battleguard. ranged is usually top for that fight.
---
Thats always my idea. I am also ending up healing everytime, cause I love it so much. Don't run away from  yourself my friend
---
Good thing paladin is a healing class not a dps class.
---
Alliance is actually favored in big pvp, due to giving freedom and BoP on mages helps massively.
---
Is that 7.7 fps?
---
Everybody should roll the same on BOE epics and blues, be it Need or Greed. Was always this way when I played.
---
I almost guarantee I'm better than he was. Classic was 0 mechanics all preperation. Modern mythic raiders have mechanics, game sense, and theorycrafting that put the top vanilla players to fucking shame. You can see it in the 1:20 naxx clears by Salad Bakers, you can see it in the parses, and you can see it in player attitude. 2006 Elitist Jerks is a dogshit guild by modern top level standards. I am not speaking ironically, I'm not seeing attention, I'm saying this as a modern high end WoW player with experience in modern mythic raiding and naxx level private server content. You have to be pretty disengaged from hardcore play to believe otherwise. 
---
What sport or esport hasnt evolved over time? Basketball and football rarely see rules changes, but the metagame ebs and flows with those sports. It frankly doesnt matter if you did it well back, then, you still have your accolades, you were good at the time, but if you compare top private server players or top mythic players to 2006 vanilla naxx vets, we wipe the fucking floor with you. You guys did great for your time with the tools you had available. We have those tools, and the tools developed over another 12 years. The metagame hasn't stagnated.
---
That's just wrong. I don't understand where people get this mindset. It obviously isn't from actually facing a PvP oriented Prot Warrior.
---
It's just ridiculous to state that you're not worth the time to kill or that Prot is the least useful thing in a BG. You're just going to let a Prot Warrior (who can macro in a 2h if he really wanted to go for a kill) just completely disrupt your back line healers and casters? Lol Ok. Which faction are you playing so I know where to get the easy BG wins.
---
Farming DM N for herbs, farming stratholme for righteous orbs. Not sure past that because, that's what my brother always did and, I never played a mage. I've just never seen a mage use a job to make money. It's normally find a kitable boss to put on farm. Or AOE grind some shit.
---
I know it's emulated, but is the gameplay the same?
---
Yeah, if you saw a spriest from the opposite faction in the wild, you run the fuck away because you won’t win that fight solo. Good times.
---
Maybe it is and we’ve all become so adapted to faster pace play that batching the way it was seems bad and overturned.
---
You can’t say pservers show batching is overturned cause no one knows if they even have it right or how it was really tuned in vanilla.
---
/sit to get crit to Proc it. Has to be timed correctly re batching in beta
---
Could you stack hots in 2.0? I see 5 druids in some of the screen shots..
---
You're going to play priest because you't miss that shot where all these good memories with your first love will be refreshed. Farming you can do that with one or more guildies who will be more than happy to have a healer while farming elites.
---
That was actually originally the plan, but the F button is really full due to the @mouseovers. I couldn't quite fit it in without losing @mouseover on something. Goes to my point about specialization and customization: if you're going to PvP a lot, you'll want specific macros for it. You're welcome to try to swap them within my framework, and I'd love to steal it if you succeed.
---
2019 tech lmao. Hamstring can maybe help you avoid a couple of hits but in a large amount of circumstances (Yes, even 42+) if you pull 2 mobs you're dead and if you kite you're walking into about 3 more. If you pull even one mob a few levels above you it's going to be a struggle. 
---
Those 1 and 3 second charge stuns are great until the opponent moves 2 feet away from you afterwards. Not to mention the rage and berserker cost of intercept. Fear immunity is great vs 3 classes and if you're arms it won't last long. Warriors actually get stomped in most 1v1.  
---
Most of that combat utility is ass compared to what a mage, rogue, or even hunter has. In terms of tanking, sure the stun is strong but you can't stun bosses im pretty sure and you can't AoE fear them either.
---
The amount of listings is capped, but pretty funny idea
---
Yea we can be ganky but I find I get corpse camped way more often when I'm Horde then alliance. Alliance seem like they go out of their way to find you while horde gankers are hit or miss they usually just kill you and move on. 
---
Stealthed NE hunters camping quest givers with their pets is their favorite activity. Especially if it's an escort quest.
---
No they arent. A human with hungering cold or even maladath would never wear Edgies.
---
Bloodvine is boe but you want tailoring for set bonusen
---
Vin Diesel was a huge wow player. There's a video floating around of him and Paul Walker playing back in Vanilla.
---
Eh, those are 2 separate problems. I was speaking exclusively on homogenization. Wrath was the expansion where I felt like sooo many classes played exactly the same.
---
The point of the argument is that this is a re-release of a game from the past. It's meant to be a playable museum-like copy of Vanilla wow, imbalance and all. People want to play what they played over a decade ago, for better or worse.
---
I cant say to much about Horde experience as I didn't roll a Horde char till much much later. All I know is, with the **countless** hours I put in on my server, we spent days on end bottle-necked at the bridge or just before it.
---
I'm not sure what game you played, but we had damage and (mandatory) threat meters as early as MC. And while I'm sure you'll be able to find guilds that don't care, any sort of progression guild will most definitely keep an eye on your performance because nobody wants to spend an hour extra per raid because the DPS is slacking.
---
That's the goal. The raw numbers are still going to hold back their raid performance, but in small groups and PvP there's a lot of opportunity for player skill (via macros).
---
You could find inspiration from this channel https://www.youtube.com/user/SpacedNeedle
---
1-60 no questing add-ons.
---
Paladins should always have a shield on, so their armor is much higher than a clothie. As well paladins will be mixing armor types, not wearing full cloth. There's a number of leather pieces which are best in slot for a long time, just like robes of the exalted are SO much better than anything you will get for a long time. 
---
As well, blessing of protection and divine shield, makes it very easy not to get destroyed by a rogue before you can heal yourself to full. (Or continue to heal your team)
---
In duels, true.
---
you dont have to convince us of that, convince EA/Activisionexecs that the box price is enough for a game
---
It will be harder, quite unplayable considering horde will have more players
---
Appreciate you taking the time to do this write up. I’m surprised I hadn’t thought of something so simple yet useful as using a modifier macro to refresh forms for breaking snares. Really like this idea. The potion macro is another simple macro that’s gonna be really useful too.
---
Kiting mobs works great until you walk into 3 more
---
Isn't AH related, but during Warlords of Draenor I would COD (Cash on Delivery) items to random players. They wouldn't check to see there was a price to taking the item, boom, they gave me 9k by clicking the item.
---
However, I got reported and banned for a day for this scam because although they can see it has cash on delivery if they paid attention, it's still considered, well, a scam.
---
This is why they added a bonus for wearing the right armor for the class (in wrath?)
---
By Grabthar's Hammer.......what a savings.
---
If i remember correctly, there was a warrior that had a bug and an extra talent point that made him truly op. Do you have any recollection of this ? Maybe it was in tbc.
---
Wow characters are all cartoonish in my opinion. It’s why I like them.
---
That's wild. 😂 Kudos to the team that made this happen.
---
I want to add to your additions!
---
1. DPS warriors bring utility in the form of Challenging Shout (MC imps, some AQ trash) and stuns (BWL dragon trash packs) and Battle Shout (buffing other melee in group) and ThunderClap/Demo Shout (so the tank doesn't have to).
---
[Mila Kunis](https://www.ranker.com/list/top-celebrities-that-play-wow-_world-of-warcraft_/misterbo) just showing off her old character would probably be a good way to go.
---
Why does it need to do as much as MS or BT?
---
I'm curious about this. A Prot Warrior isn't playing to get kills. He's playing to disrupt healers/casters. Peel for allies and soak up CC and GCDs from enemies.
---
Dealing damage isn't everything in PvP, especially in BGs. Just because a Prot Warrior can't 3 shot a person doesn't mean he's useless or not viable. Having multiple silences available to them, and being able to stick on someone's face while taking a good amount of damage is just as viable.
---
You aren't out there soloing trying to kill people. You're out there creating opportunities for your allies and trying to get enemies to throw damage and CC your way instead of your teammates.
---
It's a team oriented spec. You have to play it differently than a Arms or Fury War.
---
Exactly, vanilla is a mess of a game, but Classic is a faithful recreation of that old beautiful mess. Vanilla WoW was horribly flawed, but that's exactly part of what I loved about it.
---
jesus man
---
Simple solution? But some WC deviant fish.
---
Why I ask, it just doesn't make much sense, that a man of my stature should have to wear a dress
---
Same. My first max level was in wrath.
---
&gt; cosmetics  
---
I've always thought that selling cosmetic, especially in an MMO, was the greediest shit, man. It's fun running a dungeon, getting a cool looking piece of gear and be proud of wearing them but when you can just buy it's appearance or buy x mounts on a store...I don't know, this is just shitty.
---
Only for female characters.
---
You should play a rogue and gank lowbie horde scum!
---
UNPLAYABLE
---
If your goal is the mount, there's absolutely no better way than starting level 1 and focusing on it. 
---
When quests go grey, they give little to no rep, so you need to "hunt" down and focus on all quests that give rep to the faction you want.
---
PvP because being able to PvP in contested zones
---
We always do ERP with people. It's quite fun.
---
Why would I need to review something when you need to limit your excuse to a specific race which you didn't even mention until now?
---
Yeah it does indeed. Nice one.
---
Oh and you're absolutely right, Gorehowl would have been perfect.
---
Is paladin one of the best flag carriers?
---
Change your mind from what?  You haven't stated a preference.
---
It's preference, go Tauren.
---
&gt; threat meters as early as MC
---
Yes this is true, threat meters were mandatory for the longest time. But DPS meters, nobody really cared. I played from the day WoW released, addons weren't really a thing. Even then nobody paid much attention to them until we started really getting deep in with threat meters.
---
And for sure, if you're in guilds who want to push past through content, paying attention to how each member is performing is important, but can't expect a spriest, to keep up with your DPS warriors for example.
---
People obsess over DPS meters far too much in dungeons. There are a few classes who overperform in dungeons, and many that fall behind those classes, but the ones who aren't topping the meters, are still very important as they can bring to the table things those top performing DPS cannot.
---
I may be way off here, but like potentially 6 servers then?
---
You should solve the problem at it's root. We clearly that there something wrong with your choice of rolling Alliance.
---
Have a seat, relax, i'm sure we'll cure you at the end of the week. I mean, it has bee  done before! ;)
---
On PvP server, but not heavily involved. Endgame focus would be raids. Debating focusing more heavily in Feral while leveling and re-specing at 60. Are threat reduction talents necessary?
---
More Alliance bias, of course...
---
This exactly. The rage mechanic scales exponentially with gear. So they are absolute dogshit leveling and just passable in pre-bis. Throw them some gear though, and things get wild.
---
They will provide to whatever pays them money. 
---
If Classic is more successful than retail, they’ll build on TBC &amp; WOTLK. I’m 100% sure about that. 
---
Retail is dead. The community can accept this or stay ignorant, as they were when the vast majority told Vanilla players to “get rid of their rose tinted glasses.” 
---
Classic will come &amp; turn the WoW dev team inside out. That’s what I think.
---
10 seconds of 10%, maybe 20% atk speed increase won't do much.
---
this
---
The onus is on you to provide evidence for a claim. Basically you've just said some bullshit about being 22 and totally not being a bad player.
---
That's no more valuable than my recollection, which is that shit was indeed just as easy as it is in Classic. People have always overstated the difficulty of Vanilla and I've believed that long before Classic was a possibility.

I feel the same way. I just think they are skeptical of how much success classic will have.
---
For all other races going daggers with ACLG is better than edgemasters. If a night elf warrior has hungering cold, he will also wear better gloves over edgemasters.Its not race limited. You're just wrong.
---
How do you not walk into the other 3 hostile mobs beside you while hamstring kiting the 2 mobs bashing ur face while u pray you dont miss an attack?

---
Orc because then you tame a wolf, ride a wolf, and wear a wolf (Beaststalker set)
---
Theres def not even 1k on beta atm. No one is playing anymore.
---
Don't level as resto, there's no reason for it.
---
Well the stress test was 10. I would assume 10, but who knows.
---
it's already monetized, they will have hundreds of thousands of players coming back or perhaps millions all of which will be paying a sub
---
In a Premade a Prot Warrior can be a great FC. That's because they can just group run the flag and a healer can stay in them.
---
In random BGs and other premade formats yes, a Druid is just better.
---
Really depends on your team's game plan.
---
I know we don't want changes, but my just this once could we have combo points on the rogue instead of target? Also faster/smoother energy regen? Oh and Burst of speed!
---
P.s. Almost forgot. 100% chance sap returns you to stealth, up from 70%
---
No changes
---
They aren't going to base it off something before 1.12. That's just not going to happen. They can't please everyone.
---
I feel like I may have come at this from the wrong perspective. After re reading the initial post. I have to say. Yes Prot is viable. Under the "floss" law of classic wow. That is stack it with epics and you can make anything viable. That being said. No pre-made will ever have you. It's not that you can't contribute anything. As you explained you can. It's more along the lines of of stuff is simply better for it. So I guess I took the original question incorrectly.
---
As I generally farm R14, I was thinking in terms of. Is it viable for a Rank grinding pre-made. Not is it viable.
---
spriest doesn't do well in raids (can't give a debuff slot to SWP and very mana hungry), but I think itll be fine for 5mans.  Otherwise decent in pvp as a mixed spec build.  However, you'll be trained just as hard as a warlock, since locks have no escape mechanisms.  However, warlock is probably the strongest all-rounder in the game, good for pve and pvp, and in the same spec too (sm ruin).  You may like lock more if you dont want to heal and want to have an effective class.
---
Don’t forget to name your pet after yourself to mess with peoples target macro
---
Yeah im not joining voice to do dungeons while leveling.. or at 60. I join voice for raids or premade BG's. Otherwise im on discord with my friends.
---
Her face is to close to the girl that gave my the clap, every time I see Aubrey, its all can I can think of.
---
Echoing this.
---
Even 0/30/21 is fine for endgame.
---
There are a number of videos on it first one I saw that is pretty much it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BirMIEA1oVI
---
How is Shield Slam useless for PvP? I love stripping buffs off people.
---
I also enjoy the extra interrupt/silence for really annoying the enemies back ranks.
---
Why not? I’m leveling with a warrior and think about going holy/ret
---
Speak for yourself.
---
&gt; That's just wrong. I don't understand where people get this mindset. It obviously isn't from actually facing a PvP oriented Prot Warrior.
---
I've faced more than a few, but they're rare because they're fucking useless.
---
&gt;It's just ridiculous to state that you're not worth the time to kill or that Prot is the least useful thing in a BG. You're just going to let a Prot Warrior (who can macro in a 2h if he really wanted to go for a kill) just completely disrupt your back line healers and casters? Lol Ok. Which faction are you playing so I know where to get the easy BG wins.
---
The only strength a prot warrior brings is he's hard to kill.  But since he's ridiculously easy to CC, does do any damage of note then you don't ever need to play to his strengths.  
---
Do what to my casters?  How does that work? He'd be CCed long before any he did anything useful.
---
I'm a mighty prot warrior! Mage, if you let me beat on you for 2 minutes I might kill you!  Wait, don't sheep me! No not Frost Nova!  OMG you feared me when I was in defensive stance, and so forth.  Complete non factor.
---
This quote definitely sounds like foreshadowing.
---
Eh, it'll still be easier this time around since items will release with 1.12 itemization from the get-go.
---
&gt;The long and the short of it is simple, if more players want to be able to race change/server transfer/gender swap than players who don't want that in the game, it will be added to the game. If more players wants WoW tokens so they can farm gold in game for a subscription, it will be added to the game.
---
its not that simple though, if you make classic  more retail-like, you are also increasing cannibalization effect, because people who want those features are more likely retail players, and losing vanilla fans  over retail players who are probably already paying you might not be as profitable as you think.
---
Exactly, you want a ton of shamans. Totems are group side so you want as many as you can get.
---
They did in fact...have phones
---
Dude you're just being a pedantic asshole right now. Everyone knows the difference.
---
sorry, I am confused.  Why do you need tailoring for set bonuses?
---
There's still another way if you have an alt account or a friend. Alt/friend outside of the instance must be leader. You log out, they kick you, you log in. When you're back in, you are at the front of the instance. I'll have two accounts for various reasons, but this is a big part of that.
---
We're back in Classic where conversion therapy is totally legal. Time to ship you off to a camp.
---
If you want a world where paying some doctor to change your faction so your mental illness is more accepted, you'll have to play Retail.
---
But those heals.... so big... and you can survive a beating :D  I did the same but won't do it this time around.
---
SOMEONE SAID ENHANCE!? *pulls out torch and pitchfork* WHERE?
---
(Enhance is pretty terrible, but raid groups usually one a single enhance shaman as a nightfall bot, auto attacking bosses while twisting totems)
---
Set bonuses are only active when you have the required tailoring level
---
I received a letter in my mailbox from a GM. I don't remember exactly what it had said, but I remember them specifically saying it was against the rules, and that they removed items and gold that equaled the amount that I profited. But it exceeded the amount that I had on the character (because I had spent and traded large amount of it), so they removed my flying skill and wiped my entire inventory and gold on hand.
---
I'm sorry, but the horde areas don't have any spaces for new zones (central kalimdor and eastern lordaeron), they tend to go right to go coast (in hindsight the verdant beach should've been more horde biased to be fair)
---
plus shouldn't someone that actually cares about the horde make their zones, I haven't even leveled a horde past like 12
---
Personally, here's how I feel about it.
---
* Don't do both at the same time (charge people \*and\* reserve items). If you do one or the other I think you'll have an easier time finding people to group with.
---
* Be decked out if you want to charge people. Nobody wants to pay a tank if the tank isn't somewhat carrying them/above average at tanking and properly geared.
---
* /2 "LF group for \[dungeon\], \[item\] on reserve."
---
* /2 "Looking to get some sweet loot from a dungeon, but you're a sad lowly dps who struggles to form a group to adventure with? Look no further than \[Name\]'s Tanking Services. For the low, low price of \[x\]g I'll sweep you off your proverbial feet and into the instance portal of your dreams!"
---
* If the reserved items are lucrative (Righteous Orbs), reserve the first one that drops. You're pretty much guaranteed to see at least one drop, and others will come to roll on the remaining orbs/get gear/etc. In other words, try not to come off as greedy.
---
I don't think paying a tank is any worse than paying a mage for water/ports or a warlock to summon you. It takes time and if you outgear instances it's a great way to make a little bit of cash while being social and making a good reputation for yourself in-game.
---
Ah thanks a ton mate! Exactly what I was looking for!
---
Are you soloing her?
---
but its contradiction lol
---
I definitely except WoW token to show up sooner or later...
---
im thinking he does lol
---
If its a boe everyone needs it for gold. Therefore need
---
Absolutely not.
---
Either the philosophy is that gold is of universal value, or it doesn't work. That's not being pedantic, that's literally addressing the claim that both philosophies were "correct"
---
If gold is universally valuable, then BoP is included. If gold is not universally valuable then how much gold you already have as well as some magical weight for stats would need to be considered.
---
RP, cause guild members from both factions can just set up events where you toggle pvp flag. on pvp realms, rp guilds will just get focused and ganked/trolled and made fun off.
---
On private servers you don't need the killing blow, but the issue is when you also need to be doing damage, and things resist. If you are with a group of people and you need an ss for summon everyone will want you to starting draining soul immediately because of  resist, and i've been resisted 4+ times on a drain soul where everyone is helping and we need to find another mob because it dies. Can't always just think that you can drain soul every single mob and you dont need to worry about anything else like dps or cc or your pet or a bunch of other shit. Shit happens, thats vanilla.
---
You'll be fine.
---
The dungeons have very simple mechanics, people usually explain the more complex bosses (mainly raids)
---
Enjoy the game, take your time, classic is about the ADVENTURE, not just a zerg rush to the end, that many people will be doing as they have done it so many times before.
---

---
If you want a PvE grouping spec, that's what I'd recommend.
---
Duel-boxing sounds hard and a waste of time. Dual-boxing is pretty easy.
---
/follow is only disabled in Battlegrounds and it's not coming back. Classic does have a windowed mode.
---
You'll probably be called a noob if you make a "not meta approved" choice, but I'm in the same boat as you.
---
I'd just play the game and screw anyone who wants to act like an elitist. If it works, it works.
---
You deal enough damage and CC that you can't simply be ignored. 
---
While others are attacking you (who's built to take a lot of it) thats just Damage, CC, and global cooldowns NOT being used on your allies that should be capitalizing off that.
---
Its an old wow forum meme
---
I strongly disagree.
---
Without great threat gen, and NO TAUNT, paladin tanking is a sloppy fucking mess.   Gear won't matter, when a single mage fireball pulls threat even with your threat ramp up time.
---
The entire group needs to handicap itself for a prot pally.
---
Thank you :)
---
We also have 15 years of hindsight to know where we are going and what gear will be available from 1.4 to 1.12. When we raided in vanilla, sure we were viable in full plate raiding, but we also had the misfortune of having to guesstimate our way through the world and the unknown future, leading to not meeting our full potential. Look I'm totally for all plate and I've done the content in full plate (as shown in this thread), but these are different times. Our blind voyage through the world isn't the case anymore.  Sadly, I have to agree with the clothadins. If you want to top tier raid, you have to min/max
---
Play how you'll have the most fun.
---
Many streamers are going to be rolling probably the same realm as they like to play together and generally have a good time together.
---
As such, you can wait until the 14th and reserve and create your character once all the big streamers have announced their servers.
---
Since you ninja (heh) edited your post, I'll reply to your second paragraph.  You keep saying that we're contributing to the problem.  The problem of what, exactly?  My whole point is that many servers developed a culture that accepted players rolling need on valuable world drops--literally every time I've seen a world drop in a PuG, someone in the group (sometimes myself) has suggested everyone roll need.  Players agreeing to roll need on these drops is not contributing to a problem of stealing loot.  It's preventing that problem from occurring.
---
We can't prevent individual bad actors, and we shouldn't pretend they don't exist.
---
How about Silverpine Forest with Dalaran intact?
---
What items bruh?
---
Do not listen to him.
---
5 man tank in PUGS will be a clusterfuck mess.  A single mage fireball can pull threat off the paladin.  He has no taunt and poor threat gen.
---
Once paladin tanks lose aggro, they can't get it back.
---
Did you even read the middle part of my reply before replying to me? I know about intimidation. I mentioned it as one of the two times your pet get a CC.
---
It depends on how many hunters you've got, and if you're in the lucky position to devote other hunters to provide trueshot for the melees and for you.
---
thats absurd though. That means we'd be asking TWO things of Blizz.... it's either one or the other.
---
"Time is money, friend!"
---
Thank you for finding that!
---
Myself, PVE realms get boring as the PVE end game content dries up fast, so having a challenge and playing around in OWPvP is a ton of fun.
---
That said, play how you want as someone else said. Don't let anyone else influence you. Most times if I get camped, I log off, go to my bank alt, auction some garbage for 5-10 minutes, and generally they bugger off by then as the would-be-camper, gets bored.
---
Isn't it a contradiction to say "Shadow priest isn't a thing" and "it's worth to give you loot over any other caster when it comes to damage"?
---
Also I'm not planning on getting into a hardcore/world first guild, so would I have a lot of difficulty finding a spot as SPriest in a situation where I'd be bringing max consumes/offering my profession services to the guild?
---
They already have it implemented
---
is that a zone, or is that me just removing the bubble from dalaran?
---
It's not though.... this list is supposed to be the best in slot plate healing gear, but the bis overall healing gear. Actually arguing over semantics, lol.
---
Viable to me is being able to do a job that is important and desired. 
---
Not one that handicaps your team.
---
well you dont get holy shock till 40 
---
soooo you will be just a healer till then and shockadins dont really work till either BC or Wrath, they were never really a thing in vanilla
---
Nothing wrong with playing a carebear server.  Though, make sure you roll horde.  BG waits for the alliance are awful on PvE.
---
Savage Coast should also have been Horde bias.
---
Alliance have subtle disadvantages in AV and AB map layouts (e.g. slightly longer travel times to objectives).
---
Alliance also have fewer or worse bases in contested zones, meaning fewer convenient flight paths and mail boxes: Swamp of Sorrows, STV, 1K Needles, Feralas (lolswimming), Desolace (no convenient Mara backdoor), Badlands.
---
A lot of Alliance quests require you to go to the Barrens where you can get murdered by Horde but have no way to pick fights with them because it's not a contested zone. This includes Warlock class quests, RFK, RFD, and all of Ratchet.
---
Horde owns the best Azeroth real estate in Classic.
---
Bloodline gives you more than 4% hit, you dont wear your tier
---
Why is the Warrior in Def stance if he's fighting someone that can fear him?
---
Frost Nova all you want I'm just going to Intercept you.
---
If a Mage Polys me that just means he's not focusing on my allies and he's about to get stomped.
---
Again, a Prot Warrior isn't trying to kill anyone. He's trying to pull attention onto himself vs his allies.
---
Everytime a mage or any class targets a Prot Warrior with a spell or ability they are not targeting an ally that now has free range to blow them up.
---
It depends on what you mean by "to the fullest".  You can have loads of fun without ever stepping foot in a raid.  You may not be a minmaxingtryhard, but you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of it.
---
yea it was a bug in early vanilla that let him take death wish in a deep arms spec. Got patched out some time between 1.4 and 1.10, idk when offhand.
---
if you don't mind the rush of so many going for the same slow spawn mob
---
You'll do okay. Just go with the flow and play what you want. There'll always be people who hate on others for not choosing the 'right' spec or the 'right' gear.
---
Aren't people setting up world PvP events on PvP servers aswell though?
---
For the horde then
---
You will be fine. Honestly 80% of the players won't mind that your new and we will be happy to help. A large group of wow classic players are aged 25-40. We have (hopefully) passed our toxic online gaming phases. I know I have. I will be happy to help you as a 14 year vet of the game!
---
At least it doesn’t seem to be happening during the 30% enrage, now that’d be really unlucky.
---
You'll be called noob, everyone gets called a noob. Hell I've got some prot warrior PvP specialist on reddit calling me a noob right now because I can't see the brilliance of his prot PvP build.  Just roll with it and have a good time.
---
As far as it applying to vendoring, you already know what I am going to say. Any fury warrior can buy edgemasters for exactly the amount I sell it for. They cannot buy Truestrike shoulders for the 5 gold it vendors for. Therefore, a BoP has undetermined value depending on your need for it, and often far more value than its vendor price. Because you often get less value from a BoP you vendor than the person who uses it, it is greedy to take that item over that person. So roll greed. 
---
I know you will make some bs argument about 5 gold being worth more than a 1 stam upgrade, but that is not a common situation at all and doesnt somehow make this illogical. Noone really cares about situations like that. They are irrelevant.
---
The purpose of Classic wow is to go back to the roots of when it was good. If they add expansions that are different from retail, maybe even BC and wotlk for me, I'd 100% buy them.
---
is there any footage of this working in the beta?
---
Thats the quest im talking about. Looking forward to it :)
---
its how to gimp yourself 101 is what it is
---
Why do you use '6' and not 'T' for your keyboard layout? Muscle memory? Seems like you could use T instead. Or sacrilegiously use an 11th button. Thanks for the write-up. These are always interesting to me.
---
Fisticuffs at ten paces.
---
Well I guess it's a bit more than just removing the bubble. The mages used to be quite the dominant force in that area, with outposts and stuff... 
---
Oh well, just an spontaneous idea.
---
PvP

I didn't mean to it is honestly a horrid habit of mine that I think of something extra after I post rather than before it, you'll see I do it really often in my post history but it's something I try to do quickly do as not to deceive. Nothing ill was intended by it.  
---
&gt;The problem of what, exactly? 
---
Well I said "if" for this reason but I suppose I wasn't clear, which is my fault again. You may not see it as a problem, in which case we're at an immediate impasse and there's honestly no discussion to be had. If you're rolling need purely to circumvent others rolling need though, you're invariably causing the problem you're trying to prevent.  
---
&gt; We can't prevent individual bad actors 
---
Prevent no, but punish yes.
---
I got two kids that 1 and 2.5 y/o. I dont sleep anyways...
---
The thing to know is that while there will be plenty of elitism, there will also be plenty of new players; new to wow as a whole, or ones who started after vanilla and never got to see the content in its prime.
---
Either way you will have plenty of people to group with who are just as ignorant. Vanilla wow is a journey, not a destination. The good news is that there is plenty of information and guides out there if you want to learn more about the game and its systems
---
No your not over reacting. Just reading your post it's obvious you can't handle pvp without consent and, that's the heart of a pvp server. It's not about pvp which happens on a pve server. It's about whether or not you like to live in a dangerous world. Where bad things that are completely out of your control can happen to you. You want a scripted and "fair" experience. I'm not trashing you for that but, I find people who want that. Don't do well on pvp servers. They tend to get very whiny and toxic. Don't do that to yourself. Just play on a pve server.
---
Easy way to incur stupid AH fees for yourself without selling it if they don't out bid, calling bs on this.
---
Classic WoW isn’t even out. Also, “Fortnite Moments” is your channel thumbnail. Solid lmao.
---
my concern is that they wont announce their server because they have already stated that they might try to hide where they are.
---
I mean, I'm sure a decent amount of people would be down, but a lot of people who have posted on this subreddit, want an experience where their efforts are constantly reset every 2 years. 
---
I can see them redoing BC and Wrath, but I don't think we'll see a crazy divergent new 2.0 and 3.0
---
I guess it would make sense, probably a gurubashi villiage that defected to the horde or something, that or some orcs
---
pretty awesome site! just added to favorites :D
---
Yeah after learning bloodvine is phase 4 I think I'm gonna stack my cash until then and see what the play is at the time 
---
Will still likely be BiS until fire mage in AQ  but may not be worth for only 2 months (if the phases seem to be coming out quick)
---
Just gonna play it by ear!
---
dual boxing might work 
---
but dueling yourself seems pointless
---
1) This community will not be exactly representative of the community of Classic. There are a lot of assholes, tryhards, min-maxers and whatever else, here and in-game. There will also be great people, people who don't min-max and people willing to show you the ropes.
---
2) You have an advantage really, it will be a completely new experience for you, that is something to be treasured.
---
3) You'll do fine, just be open and upfront about not being an old hand.
---
4) When it comes to raiding, finding a guild: There will be guilds that will refuse you on the grounds of your class/race combo. There will be guilds that wont. And okay, yeah. Min-maxing somewhat for efficiency is good. Efficiency is nice. But it's not exactly required unless the servers really dry up and no one except the tryhards will play. My advice? Do some research, try to avoid meme-specs when choosing what you're going to play. Other than that.. Yeah, I'd say go nuts. 
---
And really, when it comes to raiding, just be open about your lack of experience. A good nice guild will teach you. You'll probably have to do some research on your own about gear for your pre-raid gear but that shouldn't be that bad. You'll have to do a bit of research on what gear you want in raids and what consumables to bring along. But again, the guild should teach you and usually are very upfront about what you "need" to bring along.
---
It’s not worth the trouble.  You’ll only get half the xp from kills, have to kill twice as many mobs on drop quests.
---
Yeah that’s a shame that RP-PVP wouldn’t be available right from the start
---
&gt; **- \*For anyone who wants a real vanilla experience, we will need to avoid all of the big streamers realms\*-** 
---
Classic is almost nothing like Vanilla...  lol
---
Avoiding the world buff exploit would be far more beneficial.
---
They need to do one of Peter Dinklage reading a script saying he prefers gnomes and goblins and then realizing what he just read and getting mad, storming off the set.
---
&gt; Frost Nova all you want I'm just going to Intercept you.
---
FN-&gt;Sheep-&gt;Ignore.
---
&gt;If a Mage Polys me that just means he's not focusing on my allies and he's about to get stomped.
---
You'd be 100 times more useful as a rogue, DPS warrior, pretty much anything else.
---
&gt;Again, a Prot Warrior isn't trying to kill anyone. He's trying to pull attention onto himself vs his allies.
---
Yes and I'm telling you that it's not effective.  People will spend at max 3 seconds CCing before they ignore you. Contrast that will a prot paly who's not only almost impossible to CC, but if you do ignore him he'll keep everyone at full health via healing. And if you do try to burn him down, it's a long hard slog to kill him, more so than a prot warrior.
---
Vanilla veterans probably would even prefer a ton of noobs that level slow and don’t know what they’re doing versus the elitist community that is retail. 
---
You’ll be fine.
---
I think most classes suffer from that. Every class has its own down time. The best to counter that is group lvling !
---
Well that's kinda where the problem is, when i play a game i completely no-life it playing up to 14-16 hours a day. I will play this game a lot when it comes out, but lacking information and experience i will probably still be behind compared to others because i don't know how valuable an item is, or where exactly to quest etc.
---
There were times i vendored pretty valuable items because i didn't think they would be valuable, only to find it out later and see the price in the AH. Spending all that time and still being called a noob/casual kinda hurts you know.
---
Classic as a product must recoup its costs and result in net income; it is not "paid for" in the sense you are implying. If it does not add to the bottom line, they will change it until it does, or cancel it. Hopefully it flourishes without changing the formula.
---
he's talking specifically about the beta because nobody is playing the beta anymore. they should've invited more players
---
Oh wow, I thought rep was the same just only XP was diminished when quests went gray. That of course negates my earlier question of not going at 1.
---
&gt;As far as it applying to vendoring, you already know what I am going to say. Any fury warrior can buy edgemasters for exactly the amount I sell it for. 
---
Not necessarily, and even if it was. Any Fury warrior can also vendor anything for the exact amount you vendor it for.
---
&gt;They cannot buy Truestrike shoulders for the 5 gold it vendors for.
---
Irrelevant, they **can** vendor it for the same money you vendored it for.
---
&gt;. Therefore, a BoP has undetermined value depending on your need for it
---
No, ALL items have an undetermined value, AH values fluctuate and even if they didn't the value stats give can't be objectively determined. 
---
&gt;often get less value from a BoP you vendor than the person who uses it
---
AGAIN define "value" here in an objective way, if you can't everything you say is utterly meaningless.
---
blizzard invited hundreds of completely random players to classic beta and almost all of them have quit so far.  we thought we did...
---
But it shouldn’t exist after two weeks. Also, layering could easily have the same problem. Let’s say asmongolds server still has a 20k pop after 2 weeks, and one server has 3k already. However they do it, they may need to balance it with queues + realm transfers to less populated servers to escape the queues. 
---
If that server has 8k pop four months in, Blizzard fucked up. That could easily still happen with layering. They have to have a hard cap, and I really hope they don’t back down from 2 weeks. Because in that scenario, I guess I don’t care too much what they do, because it’s such a short blip on the radar. But if it extends to servers that have 8k 4 months later, that’s blizzards fuck up and I won’t want to play 4 months of layers and will unsub til they’re gone at that point.
---
I used to do it all the time.  It will be a viable strategy on your next character in October.  Not so in the beginning.
---
And that's understandable, for best advertising I am sure they will reveal it. They are going to want people playing on their server, not just to "give them free stuff", but also so they can gain followers for their content. Their content would be more of a draw if you are able to interact with the person, whose content you watch constantly.
---
In modern wow currently, quite a few streamers have runs they do, where they carry people for M+ keys, or have raids where they take people from their livestreams. Without X-Server (which will not be in for classic) will not be able to do such things.
---
But time will tell.
---
As much as I see your point, I look at it like it’s just apart of the game mechanic. Just another challenge, it’s nothing personal, no one is picking on just you. Everyone’s getting ganked. When your playing an rpg, and there is two factions, it only makes sense for them to be at war. So maybe you careless about that but that’s just how I look at it.
---
well yeah
---
the info is all out there and you have 2 months to learn
---
Classic is about knowledge, and dedication
---
its not a surprise, vanilla WoW has craaaazy attrition. its gunna be a niche game
---
I was just reading this. Holy hell it seems worse than we imagined.
---
They didnt on my pvp server back in the day. I just got ganked or ganked people who were in the way of the 40 man raid train. didnt really see much world pvp when I was 60.
---
Maybe they do, but I doubt there will be any lore surrounding those events, while on a rp server there will be a nice backstory written about it. atleast I think, no experience cause I never got passed Goldshire when doing RP for some weird reason.
---
blizzard is allegedly cancelling classic wow and merging with epic games to create a warcraft-diablo-starcraft-overwatch themed fortnite   
---
allegedly   
---
&gt;The fact smoothebrains are entertained by it by the millions means nothing.
---
It kinda does lmao
---
wait we do meme spec now ?!!!
---
&gt; I hate PvP servers because it's not really PvP. It's just repeated ganking by high levels, over and over, just an excuse for dicks to be dicks.
---
While this happens, this is not all a PVP realm is. Most PVP combat on fresh realms happens between close-level opponents and it remains that way for quite some time. Besides, once the Honor system comes out, most people will want to maintain Rank 3 and DKs will destroy your rank in a matter of hours.
---
&gt;  plus my friends want me to be a pally tank so I'd want to level as prot for dungeons and to learn the spec more.
---
Please don't do this. One, you should decide, not your friends. Two, you don't need to be Prot specced to tank any of the leveling dungeons.
---
&gt; Am I overreacting by saying I'd rather go play by myself on a pve server or back to retail than to be subjected to some piece of shit 14 year old wasting my time over and over because it gets his rocks off?
---
Short answer: yes. You'll have more regret not playing with your friends than you will not playing on a PVE server.
---
I played a Lock from Vanilla until the end of MoP.
---
I've been playing classic servers leading up to official release off and on for awhile now.
---
My advice is to choose a gathering profession (Herbalism or Skinning) and then either go Alchemy or Enchanting for your second.
---
You'll get so much more use out of potions or enchants while leveling, and have a nice gold boost from selling mats early on. Another strange option is skinning and leatherworking - just to sell most of the leather, and of course for the kits if you're choosing not to enchant your gear while leveling.
---
Most of your leveling gear you'll be able to buy cheap from the AH or get from quests/dungeons. Switch your gathering profession to tailoring around 50, and you'll be set. (Drop leatherworking too, if you went that route)
---
Cloth isn't that expensive to buy, nor hard to farm when you're able to AoE through the mobs that drop it.
---
While everyone is hording cloth and grinding away to level, you can snatch up the items they've crafted and put on the AH. Meanwhile, you'll be selling all the cloth you get, or saving it for when you're ready for that high level tailoring gear.
---
Except Sholazar Basin
---
Then the options are to save one name on three potential realms and just hope very strongly that at least one of those three makes it.  Or, save two weeks of unused subscription and roll the dice on your name come opening.  It would suck to lose your identity though.
---
sounds like you will fit right in
---
you have 2 months to research the basics and the rest you can learn as you go
---
This is me exactly.  Most of mains in the past have been healers; i'm going dps this time and loved my rogue in the past.  You don't need to be selfish though, you help with your big dps :)  Friends are a key in WoW
---
This seems like a larp to me.
---
Lmao WoW was the ultimate casual, carebear MMO on release. Fortnite and Minecraft are perfect parallels.
---
Shame the zone's quests were pretty boring overall though.
---
or me :&gt;
---
classic is ezclap
---
Try to plan your route around spending time in the zones where dungeons are, because 1 handed dungeon weapons are not as hotly contested while leveling as 2 handers, but are obviously a massive upgrade. Also, by getting a couple pieces of on level blues, you can justify investing in armor kits. Rogue has very good active mitigation, but that just means you get more value out of each incremental armor point than a warrior. 
---
If you don't go alchemy, skinning is very viable on rogue, as you can really use ~10 seconds out of combat after every fight to regen energy and have your next energy tick ready right before you reengage. I would always go either skinning or alchemy on a rogue (if you go alchemy, you have to go herbalism IMHO, which means you cannot go skinning). 
---
Don't be afraid to use your throwing knives to pull stuff into what you are skinning to increase your kill rate.
---
most importantly, LEARN AGGRO RADIUSES AND KEEP THEM IN MIND. The reason people hate rogues in dungeons is not because of their dps, most people I suspect don't even use damage meters. They hate rogues body pulling extra mobs because they are low level and stand way out where they shouldn't be. 
---
If you have to, just stand 10 yards behind the tank and throw knives at shit. If you can't dps, it's the tank's fault for not pulling/losing the mobs close enough for you to actually hit without pulling extra packs. IF you pull extra mobs because the tank didn't position right, that's your fault.
---
Yes as a hunter.
---
There are no problems with that in retail. You have a lot of freedom of binding abilities but almost anything that combines lua and combat wouldn't work
---
It isn't vanilla, but Blizzard have a strong stance about available automation options and here I agree with them
---
X did not go to zero when blizz first introduced MTX around wrath, no reason to assume it certainly would this time.
---
Retail has literally taken the same route that diablo did-now retail wow feels like playing diablo 
---
It’s a different shell but underneath there’s practically the same
---
ill ask you not to be disgusting sir
---
this is a family friendly sub
---
good day
---
No I must play balance druid.
---
technically there is no spell power in vanilla, its called "increase damage and healing done by magical spells and effects"
---
Not to the word "objective" but whatever Reddit needs to pick up a thesaurus.
---
yeah but pallys are the slowest by a wide margin
---
their damage is just... not there lol
---
grouping is advised
---
Maybe maybe not, we have no real reference point to real vanilla only blizzard has that.
---
we can't know because we don't have a proper reference.
---
Alliance has the advantage in early raiding though, due to the location of IF
---
I raided enhance in vanilla. If the people you play with like you then it's really not hard to get a spot in any raid that isn't a no life hardcore neckbeard guild.
---
Well he has no shortage of applications for his classic guild!
---
People opening trade without your consent 10 times a day so you open their lock box. Have fun mate! ;)
---
They put swirly ball back on retail servers like a year ago.
---
Well, that's my daily dose of cringe. 
---
I mean, depending on what time he's on vs others, what server, how many people were invited or even have the time or willpower to play, depending on how many layers have been created, etc. 
---
The main complaint in the video was "it's super annoying they won't add more people to the beta" "they just need to add more people"
---
The game isn't dying, the beta is just empty af and needs more people.
---
Few zones had the great vibe of Tanaris: the music, weather, atmosphere, rolling dunes...
---
skeletal horses arebpretty meh, but the warhorses are bomb af
---
FYI this is how spell resistant works:
---
**Spell is casted &gt;** check to see if spell affects the target or not (based on target level, and base chance to spell "miss", targets talents, buffs and equipment) then:
---
* **if a hit:** then spell damage is reduced by targets resistances/buffs/talents/gear then what's left goes to hp.
---
* **if a miss:** then the spell effect/damage Is 100% ignored (aka full resisted)
---
Elemental Resistances only affects what happens after a spell has hit.

I just wouldn't worry about it
---
You’re not gonna make it to 60 on a PvP server before you quit so there’s no real point in doing something strictly because of peer pressure.
---
classic is  based on 1.12 so well past that point. It has the talent reworks and Naxx and all that. The phases will unlock content but the different phases won't introduce new balance patches like in vanilla. The balance will change as new gear becomes available of course.
---
Or just some Goblins that remember their roots in the Horde. If the Alliance hadn't been so shitty to the High Elves, you guys could have had more pointy-eared pretty boys and we could have had our Goblin brothers early.
---
The real answer is that you communicate loot rules and agree on them BEFORE this issue comes up. If you just need blindly on BOEs without having said anything about loot rules at the beginning of the run, you're doing it wrong.
---
No Tanaris?!
---
Actually, both the zombie and skeleton quests, while excellent sources of XP under normal conditions will be extremely overcrowded on launch day. Those particular quests are well worth skipping.
---
I've been reading every single one of these responses whenever I get the chance and I think this is the one that has stuck with me the most. I suffer from Paralysis by Analysis WAY too often in games, especially when I'm ridiculously excited and still have 2 more months to wait. 
---
I'm gonna think about what I would find the absolute coolest and just roll that. No more thinking about min/maxing
---
This was the information I was looking for.. Most likely staying Horde lol
---
Ah, makes sense. Thanks for posting the explanation bud!
---
no they dont need to on PvP servers lol
---
I'll make sure to let everyone I know to DM you when they need to know their opinions, k?
---
&gt; The core part of my argument is based on the sales pitch I believe defines classic, and I believe adding their shop breaks that, you can disagree with that though.
---
Sure that's not the original pitch. But if the original pitch turns out not to be profitable...
---
Hope you dont get it and we get classic + instead.
---
That noob sure was brave
---
You can go in there and aggro them with aoe spells but I don't think you'll see them even though they can kill you.
---
The problem is that you still get lit up by casters. Defense is meaningless against spell damage so the only mitigation against that is resist gear, high health pool, and D-Stance. You could go engineering for the flame/shadow/frost reflectors, but that's not prot-specific. Prot CC is OK, but not that great. You could be dangerous when paired with another warrior, a ret paladin, or a rogue against other melee. Who knows? Meta might change in this version of the game.

---
I was really into collecting pets until they came out with loads of them that you had to buy with real money. It totally ruined the fun for me knowing that there was no way to complete the collection.
---
As an EU player, I will have to wait anyway so I can avoid the unoffical german/french servers. Though I guess if there are really only 5 EU Servers total, there won't be much of a choice anyway given that I want to play on a PvP server.
---
He asked what things are different for Alliance. I posted things that are different. Pity the poor soul who decides to swap from Horde to Alliance on a PVP server and doesn't realize that Alliance don't also have a flightpath in STV in spitting distance of Nesingwary or that the most convenient path for Alliance to get to DM is literally to ride through the middle of the Horde's Feralas base.
---
If your friends want you to play a pally tank... then they aren't friends.  Best to go do your thing on a PvE server.
---
However, when Classic has been out so long that everyone has cleared Naxx, world PvP will be the one thing keeping the game going.  Maybe avoid it in the beginning but think about moving to PvP if you stick with Classic.
---
Please never delete this post, I will need it come September
---
Just level as a ret and heal your warrior friend with lower rank heals as you both swing 2 handers. You can still heal dungeons if you save your int gear as ret spec. There isn't a huge advantage to specs at lower levels and you aren't missing out on much. 
---
Sorry to say, but shockadin really isn't viable. You need to WAY out gear people and have a ton of spell power, consumabales and rare items. Better off playing a shaman if you want a really fun melee caster healer hybrid.
---
Would also result in a lot of people quitting too. Really any major change away from classic would cause a mass exodus.
---
Look at it this way, maybe your Holy Paladin was a priest before joining the Knights of the Silver Hand. He would be more comfortable wearing cloth. And since you're standing in the back anyway, it doesn't really matter. Then you could RP it such that by the time you have cleared BWL and are wearing that sweet T2 plate then your paladin is more comfortable with his martial skills.
---
Regardless of that, some people care more about the "rule of cool." and having their Paladin actually look like one. That's who this list is for, and honestly the majority of players that play paladin and want to use all or mostly plate are going to do just fine.
---
You should do 40 man raids
---
Well said man
---
yeah noooo
---
I've never had an issue with a newb that lets me know beforehand and is open to advice, I always ask at the beginning of dungeons. Don't know the fights, no problem we can explain, just don't lie and cause a wipe.
---
ah yes vanity...
---
Yeah it's missing both the Appalachian and Ural mountains.
---
wow 4chan, it’s super credible cuz 4chan posts have never ever been wrong in the past
---
Oh cool, had no idea. Do you know if it'll be in classic? I forget which patch removed it.

hate that guy...

between humans and dwarfs, who has better animations? ive seen dwarfs hold their hands together like a prayer which is cool while humans seem like they are battle casting. Anything else to note regarding animations?
---
Cosmetic items are compromising?
---
Nothing you have to say makes one damn bit if difference after the audacity of your first sentence. Go somewhere else, troll.
---
We used fix numbers for things
---
Like 10dkp+/hour 20+/boss kill double if first time killing it.
---
Minus if you failed the tax depends on mistake level eg feared into welps at onixia counted as raid wipe fail so that was around 40 if extreme rage happend prolly dkp clear followed it if you died by onixia breath counted as minor that was 20
---
Whenever new content was relased dkp was halved for everyone
---
Pros
---
Everyone could dkp for needed items
---
Cons
---
Class like rogue would have hard time gathering gear or healers because other cloths are dkping for same items
---
Can this point come in across in two minutes and not thirty?  I'm not watching that guy rant for thirty minutes lol.
---
I envy you, just thinking about doing this adventure again exploring and discovering areas etc. that would be so great.
---
Don´t worry about finding a guild, you´ll probably get a ninja invite anyways :)
---
Quests carry you through the areas and send you to new ones, you´ll get quests for most instances too. And just play whatever you want, people are a lot more open minded this time around (I hope).
---
You may have more fun than any of the people who know the game inside and out, you get to experience the world for the first time.
---
I'd snag Consecrate and then go back into ret tree. You don't need imp righteous fury while leveling. It's actually a pretty decent path since you also won't need consecrate to tank until SM anyway. Generally it's better to just go full ret till 40 but consecrate gets more value with a duo.
---
Level 41 isn't a bad time to commit to a tank spec since you can get sanctuary, eagle plate gear, shield worth putting spikes on, and different ranks of consecrate to work with. Alternatively, you can wait till 46 to have reckoning as well.

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxzZVGzI0u transitions real nicely into [20/31/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZVGzI0uvo) or [25/26/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEu0xoZVGzI0ux)
---
Holy shield is nice to have early on while gearing up for the extra mitigation. It's also very good for the leveling phase while fighting 4-5 mobs at a time. 25/26 is a more end-game oriented in that it works a lot better once you have gear to tank without needing holy shieldl; some lightforge and a decent weapon such as The Nicker would be enough to make it worth.
---
Yes; that’s why I see it as an arcade now and not an rpg of what it use to be.I just hope the community can adapt to the different culture that will be classic.
---
From what I heard many may avoid PvP realms as they know they're likely to get stream sniped and ganked. 
---
I'm leaning towards a PvP realm anyway since I'll mostly be leveling with friend (travel in packs!), so hoping this proves to be the case.
---
Neat.
---
would love those links you mentioned :)
---
In before cease and desist from Disney for putting their mouse on the map ;)
---
&gt;The game isn't dying, the beta is just empty af and needs more people... which I don't understand why Blizz isn't doing.
---
Because they just released a big new patch and want people who are subbed to focus on that \^\^
---
I'd expect them to invite more people late July after EU stress test is done and 8.2 loses hype for most people.
---
Was it tier 0 the McDonald’s helm?
---
You have every right to need, but in fairness so does he, boe, prior to 60 atleast (meaning it's gonna get replaced soon) everyone can need on in my opinion.
---
what stage?  Mine was the exact Stage 4, but I had the  [Azuregos](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19132) head piece with ZG enchant  and the [AQ Shoulder Pads](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21694)..  I think it was BIS, NO need for the 8 piece bonus actually
---
I understand everything except for why you are limiting to 10?  Every time you use a shift or ctrl modifier, you could have just had a separate button keybound as shift+f or ctrl+f, for example.
---
Level feral
---
In my opinion yes. 
---
I tried to bring a friend in to wow during bfa launch. I had to explain why there was an orc in tuxedo driving around a level 1 character on a motorcycle in durotar. A little bit different of situation but I honestly don’t trust blizzard to maintain any rpg or fantasy elements. I honestly think they have lost control of their own world.
---
They are okay, slow though. They are better supporting faster carriers and giving them freedom
---
Can't generalize it like that. If guild wants fast progression class leaders should check for spec, consumables, gear choices etc
---
I don't think it's even up for question that Tauren culture is primarily inspired by stereotypical Native (northern) Americans. Just like how Troll cultures are inspired by stereotypical Mesoamericans/islander cultures, Pandaren pander to Asians, and Goblins are every anti-semitic stereotype thrown together lol
---
Many vets (myself included) find true newbies to be cute and endearing so long as they learn quickly. Ignorance isn't a character flaw. Even vets still have to relearn fights to an extent if they change to a class they haven't previously played.
---
&gt;Please don't do this. One, you should decide, not your friends. Two, you don't need to be Prot specced to tank any of the leveling dungeons.
---
I like leveling the same spec I'll be playing as.  I've played it on a private server until level 32 so far and it's not that awful. Don't even have Reckoning yet. And the spec has actually been enjoyable so far. I do think you need IRF to be a good pally tank, even while leveling, though.
---
Is there any other option for plat weathered on Ally than Female Human?
---
there's isn't fuck all to do in the beta once you hit 40 and as we're getting closer to release less people are going to play. 
---
can't tell if you just want to shit on classic, I know it's all /u/mage_girl_91 does
---
Just thought the ninja edit was funny given the topic, no worries there.
---
I would agree that individual players rolling need to combat other ninja looters would contribute to that problem, but my argument is that (server culture of) communicating to the group that each player should roll need on valuable BoE items neutralizes any effort to steal loot.  When certain items can pay for an epic mount on their own, certain players *will* try to steal them regardless of the consequences.  I don't know whether paid name changes or server transfers will be available in Classic, but even if they aren't, punishment is still reactive.  Like you said, it doesn't prevent the problem from occurring.  Collective need rolling does.
---
How would you handle something like Staff of Jordan dropping in a PuG with a Mage and a Holy Priest who needs an upgrade?  They can both use it, but the Mage will get more mileage out of it than the Priest...but the Priest needs it for soloing.  Also, it'll be replaced at 60 either way and is far more valuable being sold to someone working on a twink--that's the Druid tank in our scenario, by the way.  The whole point is that the truly best use of these items is most likely being sold, not equipped by someone in the party (that's why it gets ninja'd).  Everyone needs their epic mounts, and Staff of Jordan gets you potentially halfway there.
---
I remain skeptical.
---
So not only are you too frail to overcome world PvP, but you become triggered at the mentioning that being a groups pet paladin tank makes them less of friends.  I see you're just a timid contrarian sucking on your thumb and playing with a shape box, furiously forcing a square into a circle, befuddled and dumbfounded as to why it won't fit.  
---
Fuck off.
---
3-6 months, they’ll start selling quality of life things. By that point the attention from the influencer community will have shifted and they’ll make a cash grab at all the people who haven’t quite quit yet but are about too.
---
Just because AH values on edgies  fluctuate between 500 - 1000g doesnt mean it has undetermineable value. Noone would ever make that claim about a good in the market, its absurd.   A pre best in slot item has similar value to other BoE prebis items. Usually between 100 - 1000 gold depending on rarity and difficulty to obtain. Far more than a vendor price. You can make some math based on item rarity and dungeon length if you had to, but its unnecessary since it is well understood that the difference between a vendor price and a prebis item's value  is large. 
---
The community makes the rules and this is well accepted. Its not like your alternate looting scheme is any more logically consistent and it presents additional problems as it allows a ninja to abuse it. Why do you think Blizzard even made BoE items? 
---
In the end though, the best thing is to agree on loot rules before hand. Thankfully, people tend to agree with the ones I presented.
---
Thanks for the info. Hard to remember how things felt before/after the rebalance sometimes.
---
It is absolutely viable, and if you set it up properly you don't have to switch windows too much.  Some basic follow/assist macros and a keystroke duplicator app like hotkeynet, and your priest can be controlled with keystrokes on your warrior window. I did this in vanilla. My warrior's charge would start my priest wanding my target (for example), and I had blank keystrokes on my warrior to make my priest follow, cast hots, heals and buffs, etc.  You will have to switch windows to accept quests, loot, etc.
---
Downsides imo: discourages grouping with random people, and slower than leveling individually, especially for some of the faster classes.  And of course, it feels more job-like, with no real rp/immersive feel.
---
I found it fun in a different way, but as someone else said, my suggestion would be not to do it for your first or second toon.
---
Get the black robe from the instance in silverpine, it was really good and I did the instance at least 10 times, lost every roll to other people. Still pissed about it.
---
Quest with your friends. Together you guys will defeat the gankers!
---
I can't say 100% but I truly do remember an enchantment that required bruiseweed + enchanting spells.
---
I wasn't bright enough to realize how good absorb is for aoe mage farming.  I spent more time fishing, cooking, gathering to make my money.  It wasn't as well known back then.
---
So I never personally enchanted my chest with absorb. But I swear it existed.. the data available makes me question it though.  It's just so obscure when you search for it.  And it definitely didn't JUST take 2 bruiseweed.  So weird.
---
Huhurar
---
I too get my news from "anonymous" 4Chan posts.
---
Everything I read there is just the same doom and gloom stuff we always hear.
---
Also Blizz has already stated if Classic is a success they would be open to the idea of Classic TBC and Wrath servers so that is nothing new.
---
Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock knows that Blizz is "struggling". So it isn't hard for literally anyone to claim they are a former employee and spew the same garbage everyone on Reddit says.
---
"oh great, we get to fight Gul'dan again"
---
Lol now imaging leveling as full holy specced.  Slowest.... levelling...  ever. But man do you rarely die from multiple mobs
---
It’s 2019. Can we stop thinking everything on 4chan is a leak of some sort?
---
Selling it is using the gold for things they need.  They may get more use out of it than you even.  Also a lot of people will sell it for the fast and easy gold even if they are alchs
---
Can't. They're taking off work. I'm not. They'll be 40 before I'm 20.
---
If they add monetization, the game will die FAST!
---
 [u/campodim](https://www.reddit.com/user/campodim/)  Suggestion for priest Stage 4 
---
I think that  the [Head Piece from Azuregos](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19132) is BIS at stage 4.  No need for the 8 piece bonus of transcendance. 
---
I had it with a ZG enchant on, and by far I had the highest plus heal in the guild (probly the server too) at this point.
---
I mean, they were right about "ok" in American Sign Language being a White Supremacist symbol, they might be right on this too. ^/s
---
The website claims Feral Druid's BiS for head is [Wolfshead Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345) at all stages of Vanilla - that can't be right.
---
For PvP you can make a case but for PvE surely there are better items.
---
Fury Warriors are the highest DPS in Classic WoW bar none. I suggest googing it if you don't believe it.
---
Not level a fucking warrior. It's Warlock time baby
---
4 kids, 3 play lacrosse, one plays soccer, one swims, one plays hockey and the fourth one is 4 yrs old.  It ain't going to happen sadly.  
---
I remember back in the day just getting 40 people all in the same place at the same time was a chore.  Unless there's a guild that starts raids super late after everyone is in bed,i'm never going to be able to dedicate that kind of time unfortunately.
---
Bruh, if Edgemasters drop in my group I'm needing it faster than you can blink and you can blacklist me all you want, its still worth.
---
Nairn DJ’d at Blizzcon last year. It was sick’
---
Honestly that was relatively normal at that time. Above 10 fps in Naxx was a luxury, I was always amazed with people who could record their gameplay and still get reasonable fps.
---
But in the same position, we'd probably all do it too so don't sweat it.
---
Haha gross
---
I think the best hope for classic not being monetized beyond the monthly sub is for it to be moderately popular. At that point it's seen as a sub retainer for players who are disinterested in retail and would not actively pay for cosmetics and boosts.
---
Too unpopular, and they'll shut it down after a while. Too popular, and they'll monetize it because the temptation will be too great.
---
If you equipped it right away, it's not ninja
---
Nah, im going to be playing with 7 or 8 friends and am proficient as a heal priest, warrior (tank) and rogue in vanilla.  So i'll be a valuable contributor to our group.  Actually, more valuable as a Druid i'm thinking since i'll be able to do numerous roles.
---
I don't agree that it neutralises efforts to steal. It merely permits it equally to everyone except those who genuinely need the item.
---
I don't deny that certain players will try to steal them, my contention is that joining these players in their tactics is counter intuitive to the problem. Its also counter to the whole system of need/greed to begin with. You're right that punishment is reactive, but how else could you have it be? The justice system irl is reactive too. Imagine if we said well some people will steal therefore if the opportunity to steal arises everyone can, instead of reactively punishing those who we can prove beyond reasonable doubt have stolen.
---
As for the Staff of Jordan question, I'd deal with it the way the system was intended. If you want to sell it, you greed. If you want to use it need. There isn't any arbitrary measurements that way. It's objective. It's simple.
---
I am not a lore specialist but are these designs in accordance with the Warcraft lore or are these possible zones just based on your own creativity/fantasy?
---
How do you turn off ironman mode? My grandparents can't respawn for some reason...
---
What you are describing is not a scam, but is something called [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage).
---
In a nutshell, that is where you find you can buy something, then turn around and immediately sell it to someone else in a different market with virtually no risk assumed. It's very profitable in the real world when you can find an opportunity to do so.
---
Oh lord this hits way too much home.  
---
Was a warlock Nostalrius and your dps flies out the F\*\*\*ing window once 
---
you start resisting your bolts.  
---
Also when your tank is good or you atleast **think** he is and you pop trinket pre-cast Soulfire and miss.  
---
And follow up with missing shadowbolts too just to make it worse /wristslit.
---
yeah the pain
---
priests can get away with it as they have holy spells but not pallys
---
The fastest Speedleveler 1-15 at the stress test was a paladin. Just sayin‘!
---
I completely missed the AQ gate opening event the first time.  Also I never cleared all of AQ40/Naxx.  I want to get that damn Swift Zulian Tiger mount this time too.
---
&gt;a fresh 60 Warrior...will fail UBRS unless they spec Prot for the safety net.
---
This wasn't my experience when I first hit 60. I don't think it was anyone's experience. 
---
People fail UBRS when the hunter forgets to dismiss their pet
---
I'm already done with this conversation after your very first sentence. You just said to me just because you can't determine the value on the AH doesn't mean the value can't be determined.
---
We are done after that. I cannot engage with intellectual dishonesty like that.
---
The thing is, he's right and is in no way, shape, or form being an asshole. People started needing on all BoEs not because it was more fair, but because there was always some asshole who needed on BoEs even when the numbers didn't work out for it. 
---
For instance while leveling you would usually all need on the BoE twink gear, not because the person who needed it wouldn't equip it, but because they SHOULDN'T. The money worked out that it was more valuable to sell it and buy other gear for yourself. If you were going to sell it, everyone should get a chance to be the one to do that.
---
In example, if some green BoE that doesn't AH for much was a big upgrade for someone in your group, you should roll on it based on what you said. Yet, this is clearly a dick thing to do.
---
(unpopular opinion) I'd agree that Edgemaster's is a perfect example of something that many groups all need on when it shouldn't be the case. That would be like taking a Warden's Staff from a tank druid who would use it forever because, "hey 500g." That's like arguing enchanters should need on BoP's because the shards are valuable.
---
This is the thing, if someone is running UBRS and you appear in AQ40 I'll gladly chuck you some gold, hell if I'm desperate enough I might even say you can have the first blue BoE nobody needs for a wee sweetener on top, you gotta say first though.
---
Not the minmax faction though.
---
yeah, pretty poor example lol
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=2320&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=3346
---
As you can see from the above bwl from my own guild.  Feral cat is viable.  He rarely tanked except in AQ40 on trash.
---
I thought it would be interesting to have a troll trade route around the northern coasts of Kalimdor. Pretty much a small boat from the Echo Isles to Shadowprey Village in Desolace, with a couple stops along the way (I'm thinking one that doesn't bring you to a loading screen, so it wouldn't be super fast. You could maybe include some quests behind the troll village in between darkshore &amp; felwood.
---
Have a freakin plan coming into this.  LOL had a great time the last time around but I had no clue what I was doing.  Unfortunately, playing this game with limited time constraints this time around so I will be doing this extra slow.
---
Rolling on a PVP server, trying out a Shaman and making tons of alts I'll be leveling at the same time.  End game priority is maxing professions and making some gold.  Raiding will be an option for me prob just do MC and ZG like the last time.
---
PvP. You guys can role play as mistresspain and watergimp
---
Honestly, you don't need racials to beat a rogue as a shadow priest.
---
Yikes
---
Jesus Christ you really are fucking insane.
---
Not really. The team will launch classic, fix some bugs for the next few months, then...have to find new jobs at Blizzard or elsewhere. There won't be any more development work to do. Why not?
---
Just because it's not true for YOU doesn't make it not true for a lot of players.
---
I enjoyed Vanilla, BC, and WOTLK immensely.  But then they started chipping away at the world, immersion, community, and they fucked my class hard.
---
I think alot of people left after Cata, WOD, or Mist not because they just enjoyed the earliest version of the game, but that the game was continually changing in a direction that was opposite of what they liked about the game.
---
You will be able to heal in dungeons no problem. Blessing of light plus flash of light spam should be enough to get you through. You don't even need to put any points into holy.
---
That being said it is quite easy to gather up some greens with int on them though, and will most likely happen naturally if you don't sell everything. My suggestion is just save the int gear that you get from dungeons / random drops / quest rewards and just put them in the bank to use them to heal when you want to. They don't even have to be good items, just have an amount of int. 
---
Like some others have said, without any int gear you will probably go oom on longer fights or big pulls, but just drink up, you'll be fine. 
---
Oh, and if you are worried just bring some mana pots, will make things go more smoothly when someone pulls something extra they shouldn't have.
---
Even if that were true, which I doubt it is, I cannot stress enough how overrated Wrath and TBC Servers are compared to Vanilla. I love TBC but both expansions of WoW's golden Era don't hold a candle to Vanilla. Those are simple facts and proven now through almost 10 years of private Server history.
---
I feel like with WoW Classic, people aren't constantly embarrassed by their country though, as with the other two.
---
"what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.  I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
---
I'm not watching that douchebucket rant for 10 seconds. Seriously, people need to just stop posting links to streamer videos and playing it off as content without discussion.
---
Thanks for the updates. Any plans of adding bis for fury 2hr?
---
But theybdont pve.
---
I don’t think you know what a paradox is.
---
[Orcish] Kek
---
Hmm why would a pure dps class outdps a hybrid class
---
I think both, I don't think there's been a lore issue so far with any of them in terms of contradicting the lore, but I have had to add some stuff for the zone to be there
---
“Content”
---
I played Alliance pre-BC and no way I will play Horde. Difficult for me to comment on difference as I didn't roll Horde for friends till way later but I enjoyed my Alliance experience. Was always the underdog in Battlegrounds but that is a bit dependent on server I suppose.
---
I didn't even know some dungeons existed till BC when I made a Horde. Alliance have Deadmines and Stockades, amazing early game dungeons located close to town.
---
It's not BiS for Orc's with axes either. Humans and Orc's will be the majority of fury warriors as well.
---
I've played both factions on and off through the years and in classic as well.
---
Alliance has a *far and away* better leveling experience. This is mostly due to the fact that during development of classic Blizzard worked on the Alliance side first before moving on to Horde. This allowed them to better flesh out and detail the Alliance zones so that they actually feel more streamlined. The zones are better organized and the storylines are more engaging. However as they neared the launch of the game they didn't have enough time to go back and put the same quality into the Horde zones. This may be one reason why in modern WoW they have two different teams working on the faction development simultaneously. 
---
That may not be enough to challenge your friends' nostalgia, but it is the more practical reason to start as Alliance.
---
I'm confused why you have Drakestone as an offhand for most DPS casters, when [Spirit of Aquementas](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904) is more Spell Damage.
---
Please. You are just being willfully obtuse to prevent having to make meaningful arguments. You are just forcing me to be unnecessarily pedantic now. Just because you cant say edgemasters is worth exactly 1000 gold doesnt mean its value is indeterminable. Lets say there are 100 edgemasters on Ah between 500 and 1000 gold. Well its pretty easy to say that edgemasters is worth 500-1000 gold. You can determine a range for it's value. You can determine a mean value. This is how economics work. Noone says their house has undeterminable value. You are the one being intellectually dishonest. 
---
There is another user who has made similar arguments that you also are choosing to ignore now because you cant win and you know it.
---
wespon enchant is "+30 spell power" if we are being that guy
---
whoa whoa whoa, hold up a minute. i am by no means advocating that forcing your employees to endure extended work days due to 'crunch  time' is okay. i am in no way saying that employees can be treated like dispensaries of money or anything of the sort. i was explaining that, sometimes, money is not the direct cause of why projects are delayed. that's all.
---
i think you are arguing a topic that i had no intention of arguing against, was just simply stating that the reason IT projects run past their scheduled delivery date isn't always because of money.
---
well yea no shit, they made that up themselves
---
Yeah, I really don't know much about enchanting, but it strongly feels like more recipes SHOULD exist. 
---
Like, if you were a game designer, and you had 2 beast slayer enchantments in the game, what would you call them?
---
Certainly not minor and lesser. That sounds really lame, for the best  enchantment of it's type in the game. Clearly that indicates that enchant-beastslayer must exist, right? 
---
Ah well, I probably won't to enchanting anyways, and I think it's probably safe to say that even if it is popular, it will have basically zero impact on the bruiseweed market, much like [imbue weapon: beastslayer](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=7434) would be an amazing way to use earthroot but seems to have no effect on the price at all. 
---
I did want to give people a chance to convince me otherwise though. There's a ton I don't know about the game.
---
The classes use their magic in different ways for lore reasons.
---
I think i read somewhere that they disabled and/or deleted the /follow command because of bots doing something or other.  If that's true, duo boxing is going to be a big pain in the arse.
---
Right... thousand gold item drops... GUESS I'm going to roll greed on it so the other 4 random people can need it.
---
Even if it's an upgrade for someone... Why would I give some random 1 thousand gold, which they likely won't equip at that point and just sell.
---
a good stop for that would be shatterspear village in darkshore
---
Finish AQ40 and try my hand at Naxx
---
[THIS](https://youtu.be/RAKvIx6eQpA?t=1203) is what the devs said about it.
---
It looks we are safe for at least a while
---
Maybe, maybe not. Don't know until you try. I'm just concerned about how cringey the experience would be.
---
2/10 not coherent enough to be an effective troll but I appreciate the attempt
---
They'll have the data on what the active subscriber is spending their time on.
---
I don't know how you think they wouldn't be able to track that type of data in 2019.
---
or in anyway worth reading lol
---
&gt; The game isn't dying, the beta is just empty af and needs more people... which I don't understand why Blizz isn't doing.
---
I think you really nailed it, it's a beta that's LEVEL CAPPED. People have capped, they have burned through everything up to that point, pointed out the bugs right now, and there's not much that needs to be done besides give blizzard time to fix things so they can move onto the next phase (40-50 stuff probably)
---
If there is stress testing to be done, they will do another where they will open it up to everyone with a sub.
---
Beta is for what you said, "BUG FINDING AND STRESS TESTING". It's not the full game, I don't care if the beta is dead right now, we need time for Blizz to fix what's broke before moving on.
---
Wow classic beta
---
I still cant believe that they basically trolled an entire county
---
its like a south park episode lol
---
Communication, make sure everyone is on the same page at the start of the group.
---
Don't just assume things and then get mad when everyone had different assumptions.
---
&gt; Discuss
---
Discuss it with your group before you start.  Problem solved.
---
Going horde priest, torn between troll and undead. Initially was going to go undead, but i'm going to be leveling with a friend going orc warrior. Convenience aside from starting as a troll, is it that much more beneficial to roll troll or is undead more valuable for anything other than WoTF/Plague for pvp?
---
Well, if it's dying it's better he never try it!
---
Im an idiot, but why cat on NE? My friend is gonna roll a NE Hunter with me.
---
Is it because theyre the only pet that can be tought stealth? (Prowl i believe its called)
---
I really don't agree. The average won't be more than 2 hours per day. Maybe at the start it will be, but after that it certainly won't.
---
Yeah, there wouldn't be that huge need for Classic if retail had been good for exstented periods. There has been moments after Cata where it has been good, and when that has happened, call for classic has gone down.
---
Robin Williams used to play. Digging deeper, he loved to troll trade and had people laughing all over his server.
---
Thank you for the insight.  I have a setup with a couple monitors or I could even put it on a seperate laptop.  I think the biggest con you mentioned is it could break the immersion of playing the game.  
---
I think I'll give it a try on retail and see how "workman" like it makes me feel.  I'll also look into the macros which I think could really make it engaging.
---
I mean, you're not wrong. The media in general is very inaccurate in terms of numbers &amp; hype. Games all the time receive too much hype &amp; end up disappointing players (see Destiny). Other games receive no hype, yet are a dark horse competitor in the industry (see Apex Legends).
---
I stopped listening to what the polls, media, ratings, &amp; reviews say. You need to experience things for yourself &amp; make judgement calls. I don't think I've ever hated a movie I saw, regardless of the ratings on rotten potatoes, facebook, &amp; friends.
---
Trump arguably had help in the election, but I don't think it mattered as much as people think it did. Snubbing Bernie from the DNC nomination probably was the major factor lol. He didn't really care cause he got paid out, though.
---
I know, it's hard to see the BIG picture, for most people.
---
I will REPOST this thread after August 27th.
---
Bookies had Brexit at 36 to 1 chances to pass. The EASIEST $3,600 I ever made, betting $100 on Brexit. I guess you people will call it "luck".
---
Except it was just me seeing the big picture.
---
need that ad money
---
what is this witch hunt of inferring statements and running with it like it's biblical truth or something? 
---
i was stating that it's not realistic to announce a project's delay after it's been announced. not that it's okay to treat employees like crap. the fault in this situation falls SPECIFICALLY on management 'needing' to keep shareholders happy. the whole system is absolute garbage and encourages the mistreatment of employees. it needs to be done away with.
---
its like somebody says 'man, this situation sucks' and i reply with 'yeah it sucks because x' and you're replying with 'lol you care more about x than y'
---
this sub really needs to stop running with these extreme interpretations of simple statements. everybody all buttmad all the time or something.
---
It's all in how you look at something. I don't look at World PvP to be a "challenge," rather a nuisance I can do without. Challenges can be overcome. I don't see myself doing that because I don't like it or care enough about it to enjoy it, and if I don't enjoy it I see no reason to partake of it.
---
A thing is called "good" when there is a greater number of people who describe their experience with it as being positive or receiving satisfaction from it, more so than the number of people who describe their experience as causing displeasure. The game can still be bad, but it is bad *to you* and that is in no way objective.
---
if you had listened to the clip at all you'd realize he's talking about the beta specifically
---
You are completely opposed to the idea, you aren't gonna like it, which means you aren't gonna make it. You would be doing more damage to your friend group by making them think they could rely on you than just doing what you want instead.
---
Better than Blues with 0 +Heal. There are pretty much no other Chests or Shoulders except these two.
---
I was talking about similarities...not that EVERYTHING that happened with Brexit and Trump will happen to Classic WoW.
---
Just some similarities, that were fundamental for Brexit and Trump to win.
---
Yes. Night elves have stealth as a racial ability and a cat is the only pet that can hide along with them rather than giving away their position or having to be dismissed.
---
A lot of people are going to be playing classic because of the high level of social interaction built into the experience. If you ask people to get on discord you will probably get a lot more people jumping in and chatting then you might think. 
---
Of course voice chat is not needed to complete the dungeons, but dungeons aren't usually the most efficient way to level anyway so a lot of people will be doing dungeons just because they want to do some group content.
---
Thinking back, i saw that, but had no idea who Aubrey Plaza was at the tiem.
---
Yeah, that was one of the stops, I just mentioned the end points! It would give the trolls a bigger, yet nomadic/split impact on the world. They're pretty much supposed to be the most populace race on Azeroth yeah?
---
I think the question is does a cash grab shop make more money in classic or retaining a large number of active subscriptions.
---
The point is classic players are most not the players being every pet, mount, and skipping the leveling process.  So if you come into classic with that type of cash shop... Many of us will smell the shit and completely bail IMMEDIATELY.  Then how many subs are you left with?  Are they spending enough in your shop to make up for the 75% playerbase loss?
---
It seems unlikely.  That's the point.  Not that blizz isn't greedy but that going for that system WON'T make them more money then having healthy longterm subscription numbers.  But who knows they've fucked the game and lost millions of subs before with weird ass decisions so they can def do it again.
---
I think it was on patch 1.10, but I'm not sure.
---
But 100% it was removed before TBC
---
Vin Diseal is actually a pretty huge nerd, despite his looks and his being in huge pop corn movies.
---
Chronicles of Riddick has a lot of his ideas for making a space fantasy setting, and it's kinda rad.
---
Ah, I thought /follow was off for all of classic.  That is good news indeed.  
---
I am a horrific speller.  What a funny mistake.  Duel vs Dual.
---
That is definitely a legit concern I've also thought about, but I think they've figured it out at this point. They know I have not committed to anything yet.
---
Night elf priests have some of the best griefing the other faction potential with Shadowmeld and Mind Control. Although in terms of actual usefulness you are correct. Every other race is much better.
---
Show me a diehard PC player without a mobile phone
---
BoE's were usually rolled on by everyone in vanilla on my server, everyone needs gold.
---
The only thing that keeps me going as a rogue is slowly seeing my Crit % increase.
---
It's a fan service, they generate more than enough through subs and mtx. Im sure they intend to draw people in, but that's just icing.
---
Highly recommend delegating duties to officers as there is a ton of work that goes into running guilds efficiently.  Otherwise you may find yourself burned out.
---
Sure. We have them. Doesnt mean we want to play Diablo on them.
---
Now what you have to do next is assemble a team of artists to design mobs, landscapes, scenery etc but ONLY give them the name and raw map you made. Then you can hand pick the best ideas and mesh them into a cohesive zone. Do some quest writing and encounter design and you've got a whole zone done
---
500-1500 ahahah. You're very clueless.
---
In Classic it's actually going to be very easy to play with people since content is harder to complete. Naturally, people are going to be looking for help in the local chat channels. I can honestly say you're going to find it very easy to make new friends while in-game. If you want to use Reddit to find people to play with that is fine, too. But I have full belief in your ability to find friends once Classic is finally released. The community aspect of the game is so strong! GL
---
I like G over T, but use them both
---
Trump didn't win a majority. Clinton did. Trump is only president because the USA has a dumb rule that makes an Idaho persons' vote count more than a Californians'.
---
Literally the moment you claim an item listed in a market place like the AH has undeterminable value you are being intellectually dishonest.
---
Oh yeah, it needs to be in the LFM advert what loot rules you're doing if it isn't the standard for the server.
---
yeah, demons being evil inter-dimensional beings feels better than demons are actually an evil space empire.
---
No it doesn't. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Jamie lee curtis goes to blizzcon and dresses up and everything
---
Imagine...
---
A convention full of lemmings.
---
A developer announcing a game for lemmings.
---
Lemmings are not impressed.
---
Lemmings on reddit make jokes about this.
---
I had a similar thing happen with Alcor's Sunrazor in an UBRS pug right before Drak. We all rolled despite the rogue being in the group.
---
It was during the point in time when there was a glitch with the rolling (or something like that i can't remember), so we all would pass and the /roll. I remember being so happy after rolling a 100. Then the rogue in the group that rolled something like a 10 grabbed the item, pulled Drak early, and left the group. :(
---
There's a lot more that say cosmetic items are fine for companies to make money from, as long as they stay cosmetic. So I guess they can't please everyone. I'd rather have sub prices not go up.
---
Was looking at the rogue talent trees and I've noticed Combat has a great deal of survivability. But if I'm going strict PVE and always fight alongside a tank, the Assassination tree looks like a pure DPS output tree with little utility or survivability.
---
Thinking I may level assassination. Gotta put those points in Malice.
---
You know how I know they didn't focus the beta invites on "old account, and people interested in classic" the second any retail content drops the beta died.
---
Touche. Well one thing is for sure though....I WILL WIN!
---
&gt;Am I overreacting by saying I'd rather go play by myself on a pve server or back to retail than to be subjected to some piece of shit 14 year old wasting my time over and over because it gets his rocks off?
---
Not at all, if you don't want to play on a pvp server don't.  No one will be happy including your friends if you feel like they forced you into playing on a server you don't want to be on.
---
Although you can always wait a few months and if your friends have picked a server where their faction is dominant you can roll there and it'll be basically the same as a pve server.
---
I remember those profession packs, ez gold
---
But there were a lot more players in WOTLK than Vanilla.  So if his X is vanilla players (now classic players) once the game became WOTLK there were lots of new players.
---
It'd be interesting to know how many of us who started in Vanilla bailed with those types of changes.  I did.  But those that started in TBC or WOTLK maybe were more OK with those changes.
---
I'm not agreeing completely with OP.  I'm just saying if X is classic players WOTLK isn't classic (or vanilla) so no the 12million people playing in WOTLK didn't bail with those changes but only a fraction of those were Vanilla players and many of us did bail from what I hear.  Rare to see an OG player who stuck around past Cata.
---
How exactly does this work?
---
Oh absolutely. I agree with your post.
---
Not having auto root or bear charge kinda blows, but if you want a low impact PvE build this is perfectly fine. A lot of people will give you perceived optimal builds, but do what’s best for your play style.
---
The only Thing I would say is that having furor and the threat talent indicates some desire to bear tank, having feral charge would certainly be cool for that.
---
It is very easy, with guides about how to do things.
---
Some things that are important:
---
If you want to tank raid, then you need to be a warrior and play actively. Druids and paladins are not really allowed to tank (unless they are friend with guild leader).
---
Keys and attunements are important since some content is locked behind it, so need to look that up. There is some wowhead page with all information.
---
If you play actively guilds will invite you.
---
If you want to be in the best guilds you will need to get the best gear you can as fast as possible, use a good raiding spec, do all attunements and be willing to use consumables in raids.
---
Any guild that care about progressing in raids will not allow certain specs though. Like priest/pala/druid/shaman generally have to be healers.
---
There is guides and bis-preraid lists that show what is the best items for each class. Also information about every raid, dungeon and boss, tactics and loot.
---
In phase 1 people will rush to lvl 60 to quickly start raiding since you can only do each raid once a week so the quicker it is done the faster they will get gear from it. Also more likely to join the better guilds when early.
---
In phase 2 world pvp opens up, if you want to get pvp ranks you need to do as much world pvp as possible then.
---
In phase 3 bgs open up. If you want pvp ranks you need to find a group of people to do bgs with then.
---
I love her even more now. Not sure how, but i do.
---
This just isn't the case in my view.
---
We will have to agree to disagree, but competitive Pokemon is very much a slave to it's meta. 
---
It should be a given that someone playing ranked online or competitive on showdown is definitely versed in the basics and fundamentals, properly EVd and IVd Pokemon present an *insurmountable* superiority to "imperfect" Pokemon. It's just stats. That's how it works.
---
The comparison isnt 1:1 with WoW, because in Pokemon you are representing a team full of your own personal choices. A 40m raid is a team full of 40 different individuals with different levels of varying potency at the game.
---
So doing what you want to spite the meta, is victimless, doing it in a raid in WoW, is not.
---
you need a sub for retail too.  Doesn't mean their isn't a cash grab pet/mount/skip content shop.
---
That's what they mean.  Monetized beyond the subscription...
---
Not really, although they aren't the worst. BiS by far is Druid. The only thing that comes close is a Frost Mage with engineering. The gap after that is so massive that it doesn't really matter what the 3rd best class is, they are all bad just by not being one of those 2.
---
They will absolutely announce their servers because they want those mindless drives to follow them wherever they go. All the stuff you are complaining about in your original post, whether a correct prediction or not, only actually comes true if his minions know what server to roll on in the first place.
---
Agreed. I'm slowly starting to dislike perplexity for the same feeling I get when watching this guy.
---
I thought this post was going to be more along the lines of "The current generation is bitter and disillusioned and hopes to retreat into the past to feel a sense of self-worth". 
---
Anyways, there's no silent majority. Trump literally lost the majority, he won because he won the "game", which is... whatever, but he literally doesn't have a majority behind him. Never has. His approval ratings have always been below a majority. This post is complete bollocks to be frank and doesn't even make a point worth making. OP = big chungus.
---
Are you familiar with that suffocating noisome air of MTG tournaments that make your eyes water?  Yea, you won't have that feeling when you play Alliance.
---
Hence the ten foil math. Regardless I think it still shows we should have more than 13 servers.
---
My first toon was an undead warlock, I was probably 14 at the time. I was terrified to leave the starting area because I was absolutely adamant that an infernal would be lurking around. I mean, that whole area is dark and creepy, an infernal just makes sense.
---
I don't think i played that toon again. Next time i played i rolled dwarf hunter, which ended yp being one of my two original 60's.
---
If 400ms spell batching was made because everybody had, at least, 200 ms, now that we have better internet connections we have ~90ms (~50%), spell batching should be 200ms(50%) to recreate the old game
---
Not cool mate, Some people (myself included) actually enjoy tanking and my friends know that from other games so they would recommend me playing a specific tank when i try a game i am new to. There is no need to berate OP and his friend group.
---
Thank you so much for this. Most responses were great, but you just sold the class as something I definitely want to dive into. Appreciate the feedback.
---
I need on all BoE. Everyone needs gold
---
Pvp or pve? Can’t make blanket statements like that
---
Noob question: Does 16% hit chance mean that freaking 84% of times you miss?
---
If yes, is that  only the case with bosses or with any mob?
---
the cinematics were epic, but the in game translation of pandarians left a lot to be desired. Blizzard could've gone a ton of different ways with their design, but ultimately went with literal kung-fu panda copies. Also it seems like whoever did their bouncy and over the top animations was also responsible for doing the new animations for all of the other races.
---
So it’s not pre raid bis then is it... not trying to be an asshole
---
Oh, there's no particular reason to limit to 10. It happened to be what I used and made for a compelling title. You could bind a separate button for shift+whichever, but you end up having to put a macro there anyway. There is no way to have @mouseover or drop forms without a macro. You will lose function (and thus power) without a macro.
---
The real question is: if you're going to make a separate macro for your other keybind, why not just use a modifier.
---
I'll try and see if that is true.  If you can't /follow in the open world that could be very challenging. Probably not worth it actually.
---
There are plenty of lvling guilds you can join to find help questing, the server pop is going to be much higher then private servers as well I'd imagine.
---
The whole need a specific race for a class thing is only like 5% of raiding guilds.  You can get into a decent semi casual guild that can clear content without being a dwarf priest or a human rogue, etc.
---
As for general lack of knowledge, people will be more than glad to help you out and lend their wow knowledge base to you.  Just let them know you are completely new to the game.  Hell, most will envy your position.  The ellite min/maxers are the minority.
---
Yeah that’s gonna be pretty non viable in beta imo
---
BLACKLISTED!
---
Yeah they will find him asap, it wont be hard. Unless hes hidden behind layers :)
---
Then they should use the correct term MTX
---
I've considered that as well, hoping for the best.
---
Brexit is a nonsense and Trump literally cheated.
---
Or...you use COMMON SENSE, and social cues to determine that everyone (90%+ of people) has agreed that BoE is fair game while BoP is not.
---
No proof and from 4chan. Take with a grain of salt bro.
---
Dalaran is a neutral zone. There are a few orcs in the Kirin Tor, I believe.
---
I have ATVI stock. I even bought more recently due to Classic (and because the stock appears to have finally more or less bottomed) because the team is small and majority of the code already exists. So it is a low investment venture with high chance of profitability with minimal resources for the currently planned content. Classic being predicted as a large success had also not been in any shareholder conferences or management guidance. I hope they realize that part of it's success will be because there is zero pay to win, a players cosmetics is due to hard earned effort, and the community it creates. 
---
I did this once before where I bought ATVI during the Hearthstone beta after learning it was also a small team and a side project. Albeit hearthstone as a TCG is the definition of MTX.
---
As an investor I have thought a lot about this. I'd like to see BFA go mobile and console with its many MTX and pay to win for those players and then Classic to remain the dangerous world, super rare items/content only few own, and the overall RPG feel since BFA is now just an MMO.
---
That said here's what paid for things I think could generate additional profits without harming the core aspects we all love about Classic:
---
- transfer your Classic char's item transmog skins and mounts to BFA
---
- special character hair and face models
---
- standard name change, realm swap. I would only allow faction swapping to another realm. All on a multi-month cooldown.
---
- MTX to swap your spec and not add to swap gold cap. On a half day cooldown
---
- embedding hearthstone into WoW for downtimes. Pay for fancy playing boards, character skins while battling, etc. 
---
- skins for your pets (not class pets), but something must indicate it was paid for.
---
- pay to receive the main common items for holiday events you missed
---
- I do not mind the in-game money for subscription time model, but this is iffy as well.
---
- higher Tier subscription for those that want to support it. It can include PTR access, a 5-10% MS buff while dead/ghost, special chat/forums that developers frequent, priority patch download speeds, maybe even  a day or more early access to upcoming content, etc
---
I'm sure I've thought of some more too. Would love to hear what others think wouldn't ruin the game.
---
And if you got my point, it doesn't matter if the BETA is dying. There's nothing to do in it right now, the vast majority of bugs have been noted, there doesn't NEED to be a billion players on the beta right now.
---
No point in the video.
---
My common sense tells me that an argumentum ad populum is a completely shit way to determine any sort of claim.
---
Been playing since vanilla and I'm actually hoping their are tons of new players.  I would prefer to be around people who are able to enjoy something new without complaining about things being more difficult than retail.
---
Live to win!
---
I'm probably a bit biased, as I only played as feral, but hauling another set of gear to be a bad healer is such a drag. And most of the time the group needs a tank or 1-2 DPS - you could be both.
---
I’m leaning towards maybe not just saying it may not be overtuned.
---
When did that berating occur?  At the jest of saying paladin tanks are suboptimal and no real friend would do such a thing?  Or the point where the OP went trigger-me-timbers at a suggestion and thought he could talk tough?
---
Loss of hair and ambition would contribute to still being in a basement, fat, and working at Gamestop, so it wouldn't be *despite* that.
---
No matter how many people agree with you, it still isnt and cant be a fact. Arguing which expansion is best is silly, because it's completely subjective opinion.
---
Hes not wrong. What is there to do on the Beta other than level another alt?
---
Oh lmao, I’m gonna leave it
---
I do think you are being a little unreasonable as from what i remember from playing wow on a pvp realm (WOTLK not classic) getting ganked was not that common until you get to higher levels.  and once you get to those higher levels you can party with randoms while questing as a tank is always in need.
---
Dude, you’ll be fine trust me.. couple of years ago, blizz just dumped this game on us and said, ok go explore.. Nobody knew what was bis, nobody knew what drops from where, nobody knew anything and we all figured it out by ourselves. We didn’t have these resources right at the start.. now the whole internet is filled with guide about this, guide about that. 
---
You’ll be fine, but it’s never going to be like the first launch where you had 0 knowledge available to you and you had to figure out as you go
---
Trade skill stuff from vendors, esp if it's out of the way.
---
The witch hunter movie he did was based almost entirely off his DND character!
---
The hyper tech buckler from goblin in Mara is arguably a better shield unless you need the stam/armor
---
You mean to say that people who don't have their career revolving around playing Warcraft Classic aren't investing tons of hours into a character this is going to be deleted in 2 months? On top of that, not everyone who plays Classic hates Retail, there is and will be crossover especially with a new patch. It's not dying. It's just the beta.
---
You don't, the game is flawed.
---
Classic isn't some perfect product that was divinely inspired.
---
Same on my server. I think for the most part it's pretty universal.
---
Yeah, mostly muscle memory. Like I said, this is my own personal setup and it's easy enough to customize. I also use mouse buttons bound to hidden bars. I don't abide by 10 as a rule, it just made a good title.
---
I believe my original point is that not EVERY Warrior will be able to do UBRS and Dungeons as Fury as a fresh 60 especially with a fresh 60 healers in quest gear.
---
I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm just saying not every Warrior will be able to do it when they first start as 60. Some will spec Prot.
---
He means the average warlock raider will have 16% ADDITIONAL HIT CHANCE provided by gear. Thus reducing the chance to miss to the minimum 1% chance to miss. Otherwise (without any hit gear or talents) you have a 16-17% chance to miss a level 63 raid boss.
---
It means 16% of the time you get fully resisted by mobs 3 levels higher than you i.e. level 63 raid bosses
---
Ignorant purely because you only factor your own feelings into a statement made about a huge group of people (not because of your preference for PvE). Both PvE and PvP are valid ways to play, for different people.
---
A beta locked at level 40 where people have aggressively chewed through all the content is losing beta testers, therefore the complete game up through level 60, end-game content, level 60 PvP, farming, etc is doomed! DOOOOOOMED!
---
Nah, the 16% hit chance is based on enemies 3 levels higher than you. (Raid bosses are 63). Which means you'll have 83% chance to hit with spells without any Spell Hit. So you'll have to bridge the gap with gear, which will take quite a bit of time and will segment PvE and PvP gear. There will always be 1% of chance to resist any magic effect. PvP requires 5% Spell hit, so in practice it requires 4%.
---
How do we reserve a name? I missed that August 13th memo?
---
It's hard to talk shit coherently when people won't stfu at work.
---
The silent majority analogy doesn't work because trump didn't win the majority of votes. He lost the popular vote.
---
What software do you use to design these?
---
Yes, I think you're overreacting significantly. 
---
Abandoning your friends to play on a PvE server because you're worried about getting ganked while leveling sounds crazy.
---
A key thing you should check out is female dwarves with pigtails. They spin while you cast. I think a few other longer hair styles also do but not 100%
---
They are, but Robe of Winter Night are a close second. You only lose out on 1% crit and the 375? to 600? mana on cd. This is a definite downgrade, but unless you're playing very seriously it isn't too bad. Considering how much of a pain it is to get the pattern for robes of the archmage, it wouldn't be a terrible idea to wait till ZG comes out to switch to tailing.
---
You are wrong sir
---
"Oh, that's a nice box.   Congrats!"  *close trade*
---
"Why do you keep trying to give me your box?  It's yours, you keep it." *close trade*
---
"Oooh, you want me to unlock it?  Sure, I just need some proof that it belongs to you.   I mean, you could have acquired it illegally. "
---
"Fine, fine, I'll open it!  Give it here. "
---
"Sorry, didn't level lockpicking."
---
Because the popularity of Classic is based around it not having all the shit most people don't like about retail? Not trying to be a jackass, but I think it's quite obvious they can't fuck around with Classic, which is what they have shown they're not doing. They clearly understand that the audience is mostly people who have played the game before and know exactly what they want. They can't introduce cheeky MTX to the game, because it isn't new. People know exactly what the game was and how they mostly want it. 
---
There's absolutely no way they'll introduce that shit, Blizzard isn't that stupid and have shown time and time again in regards to Classic, that they listen and mostly know what people want from the game. At this point it honestly just seems like some people don't see what is happening with the Classic development, but instead judge based on how Blizzard is operating their other games. 
---
This is similar to OSRS and RuneScape in general. Devs understanding what made the 'old' game popular and what fundamentals the audience doesn't want changed.
---
BS. I played an undead mage on a pvp server back in the day, I hated pvp, I was a complete noob, and i made it to 60 and raided. You get by with a little help from your friends.
---
Yes, spells can do partial damage, if the target has more than 0 resistance. If I am not mistaken, 25% 50% or 75% of the damage can be resisted on an rng factor or fully resisted. And spell penetration was introduced in tbc if I am not mistaken either.
---
Holy damage can not be partially resisted though, either fully resisted or full damage taken, if you are a Paladin or Priest.
---
In PvE many classes use other armor types.
---
DPS Warriors equip some mail/leather gear 
---
Paladins and Shamans equip cloth healing gear.
---
There's no downside in PVE. In PvP you may want the extra armor.
---
No reason. Hunters wear many leather pieces as prebis. Devilsaur set, Truestrike shoulders, etc.
---
There is no downside to wearing leather as a hunter or cloth as a paladin etc
---
All the lemmings commit suicide. The aristocrats
---
There's a chance I played with him in WotLK for a bit. Someone joined our guild and the same day our GM said no more recording Vent conversations. The new guy sounded 100% like Vin Diesel.
---
No, there isn't. Many plate/mail wearers downgrade to lower armor types for better stats. The only downside is less armor in pvp, basically.
---
No, it's very common for hunters &amp; fury warriors to wear leather, pallies, druids, and shaman to wear cloth, etc.
---
looks like your summer vacation is already ruined
---
Rewards used in game should be earned in game. If you like to buy pixel toys, go play any of the hundred app games that are built for you.
---
😢
---
Warriors wear leather crafted sets
---
Healers use whatever stats are best usually, not always dependent on armor type. 
---
But outside of that it would be weird to see a hunter in cloth or a rogue in cloth.
---
" It might be cringy but the best part of my "wow career" was when i had a buddy to play with. "
---
Not at all. That's when the game is at its best. When you have people you enjoy playing with.
---
Lol, no. They are referring to spell hit, which is the % chance you spells have to miss. So if you have enough items that give +16% spell hit, your spells will not miss. This is nearly impossible in Classic because items with +% chance to hit are very rare. Melee classes have it easier, they only need +8% chance to hit to never miss.
---
No love for silvermoon tho
---
paint.net
---
it's like a free photoshop
---
A lot of people say wait until 44 at least before you respec, because you get a new mindflay rank iirc which makes a big difference I guess.
---
Sure you do.  They wotf your first fear and then go to work.  I don't know the typical rogue combo but with CS and KS and a kick, they have a lot of ability to shut down your casts.
---
Yeah, i don't think it is requirement to hate retail to be able to like Classic. After all retail is still the child of a Vanilla (even though it might be retarded &amp; mentally challenged child).
---
Vanilla wow was and will be a casual, new-player-friendly game. Don't worry about it.
---
Are the russians going to buy a bunch of wow subs?
---
Because the undead gut running in front of a paladin without a PvP tag in EPL is just fucked up storywise and thus RP wise.
---
That guy can also just attack you when ever he wants if you have PvP tag on, getting the upper hand.
---
They not, it's been tested, bis bwl/naxx, warrior pulls 800k, mage/warlock with same gear 1,400+, fire mages especially with rolling ignite damage.
---
Lol no??
---
Excellent information, thanks! If I commit to that tank spec, would I focus on AoE grinding mobs to continue leveling. I was interested in this but wasn't sure how viable it is.
---
Also, since I'll need to heal in raids, when do you suggest respecing to holy? Should I build a decent healing set while leveling, hit 60 and the respec to holy to grind pre-bis in dungeons?
---
yeah. you should reconsider.
---
Then whats the point of trying to level up as prot if they are gonna super out level you anyway? Heck, at a higher level, they can run you through dungeons, and wreck any campers that really mess with you.
---
No reason what so ever. There were people back in the day that would scoff at others for wearing different armor types but in all honesty I doubt this will be happening anymore due to the amount of theorycrafting.
---
Don't be surprised to see Pallies in cloth, fury warriors in leather (pre raid anyway) etc.
---
&gt; I see you're just a timid contrarian sucking on your thumb and playing with a shape box, furiously forcing a square into a circle, befuddled and dumbfounded as to why it won't fit.  
---
&gt;Fuck off.
---
If you where trying to jest then my apologies for misconstruing your text. I am all for rough comments between friends but i assumed you did not know him. I do agree that OP went off the deep end very fast as everyone on the internet should have thick skin.
---
Amen friend
---
LOL
---
I mean if you're going for *optimal* during the leveling process your class isn't even that great to be a main healer for a 5 man simply because your res has a cooldown. You'll need another healer in your group regardless so might as well ask them to be main healer. You're better off going Feral and off-healing or even just tanking in bear form.
---
But at max level you'll likely switch to healer unless a raid group wants you to tank during progression.
---
Yeah if only we had free water
---
I love PvP servers, in many ways they are my preference. That said, I played on Moon Guard and Wyrmrest Accord from late TBC through WoD and definitely appreciate the atmosphere and immersion RPers add to the game. There's a very good chance all my friends who are going to play classic will be on an RP server, and therefore I will play with them. I don't plan on RPing this time around, at all, but there's definitely something to be said about the tighter-knit community, community events, and just being surrounded by storytelling. If you love the game's story and lore an RP server really is something to consider.
---
not linen cloth tho
---
As a night elf hunter you can guard AB flags much longer than any other class/race. "Stay" your pet about 20 yards from the flag and walk further away and shadowmeld away from your pet. When someone starts capping send your pet in to interrupt them. If they CC your pet and start capping again, aimed shot them and/or do your own CC rotation, including rocket helm.
---
Rule of thumb is to try and refrain from using PW:S when their rage is low. This is usually on pull, but can happen in the middle of a pull too.
---
However, do not shy away from it when you know it’ll be handy. Times like this will be just before/after a large hit comes, or when they have some sort of healing debuff (or affects heals but not shields).
---
Not totally true. Mp5 is still quite good for a Paladin. Itemization in Vanilla is very rarely a choice of like "should I take this item with crit, or this other exact same item with mp5 instead". If you have mp5 on an item it's definitely fine, some even argue it's competitive with crit.
---
Potions are great for pvp, also i find farming herbs quite enjoyable.. :)
---
Of course man... you will learn everything as you level. You can’t let veterans or fans influence thoughts like this. You have to understand that these people are just passionate about the game so that’s why it may sound intimidating when they speak to content. Take a step back and just take it all in and don’t compare yourself to others you will learn the game, trust. Especially with the amount of time you plan on putting in
---
“Reroll and give me my name back.”
---
Didn't Trump lose by like 3 Million votes? How is that a silent \_majority\_?
---
I get constant bm from a friend of mine because I am going to play elemental shaman, but that's what I played in vanilla and it was a lot of fun. I have zero interest in topping damage or healing meters. I want to nail Alliance players so hard with chain lightning crits that they literally shit in their tiny little pants. And this time around I'm taking a diff approach to my specs and professions so it's a fresh experience. It's gonna be sick.
---
Its literally the most essential item for feral and a must have.
---
Without it you are on below memespec level.
---
You don’t drop combat by losing your target though? I would love to be able to use shadowmeld in combat, can you explain further? Thanks
---
I agree one hundred percent with this.
---
Stack int for buffing you raid
---
I would recommend going holy paladin. Especially if you are going to be leveling together. Good utility, very efficient heals at higher levels.
---
For pvp a warrior/hpala combo is almost unstoppable. If you go balls to the walls holy pvp, you can even spec into holy shock for awesome crits and a unique holy pvp build, while still being really good at healing.
---
Oh God, mods please purge this insanity.
---
On a fresh server, and during Vanilla launch, most BoEs were treated like any other BoP if it was an upgrade.
---
If the BoE that dropped is an obvious upgrade for a fresh 60, sorry but they can roll need on it in my opinion.
---
Need before Greed has always been the motto as far as I'm concerned.
---
&gt; You play Classic because you want to, not because it's a job.
---
That's now how I remember vanilla.  Raiding basically was a career. Not that I'm not excited for it again.
---
People seriously overrate the importance of engineering on here. 
---
I can literally count on one hand the amount of times engineering made the difference between winning or losing in fight throughout the entirety of vanilla.
---
Good to know
---
Of course I speak for myself - who else would I speak for?  What a silly thing to say.
---
The game is 15 years old,  no one has held 12 million for that kind of duration.  Your focused internally on the game and neglecting the external facts.  MMOs are not the king of the gaming mountain any more.  The genre was crushed by MOBAs, shooters, F2P and mobile phones.  There is way too much competition in the market place.  
---
People grow up, they mature, they go in different directions.  12 millions players are going to want different things.  I get that you think Blizz did something wrong because that is the easy thing to do.  We could all look back in 04 with rose coloured lenses reminiscing of how awesome it was while completing neglecting the fact that the world around us has changed greatly.
---
The original iPhone launched 12 years ago tomorrow.  That thing has developed from a 4gb low res brick that was incapable of connecting to 3G to phones that can compete with most people's computers all within the lifespan of WoW.  
---
The point is time moves forward and if WoW didn't make the changes that you don't like it would have been dead years ago.  Classic is going to be fun but times have change, the player base's desires have changed, competition has changed and Warcraft is still here.  If you looked at it objectively you could say that they intact succeeded.  15 years of service is a lot in an era where most games are forgotten in 3 months.
---
I remember it being different during Vanilla launch, if it's an upgrade during the first few weeks then it's no different than a BoP.
---
Need before Greed.
---
After launch settles down and the server stabilizes then yes, BoEs are usually seen as a chunk of gold.
---
A healthy server community requires new and experienced players both. Please, join us.
---
Not even that. My guild mate may need it. Therefore it helps me.
---
Maybe I have an Alt that can use that pattern to make the item I need.
---
This is why I'll get the hakkari warblades before the rogues
---
No I’m talking about the same streamers who easily completed lib with level 34 mobs with 2h tanks and no cc while level 30 capped.
---
Best to set out the rules before you go to any dungeon/raid as everyone does it differently. BoEs are generally open season unless I see someone who genuinely needs it and would be willing to equip it right away. As far as BoPs go you can always set out "reserved" lists before the group starts and set loot as Master Looter on boss fights to avoid drama.
---
Used to sit on the neutral auction house and grab big tag items for cheap while people transferred them. Only worked once but I was pretty happy to get an assassins blade for my rogue twink.
---
Also some friends and I ran a very sketchy casino where we all acted like we were competing and then when we had one a certain amount of gold we’d just log, people would get all butt hurt, but they were bank alts. We’d trade all the gold over to the one guy who wasn’t ninja logging so that he got the most traffic. Eventually he just had a really consistent client base and a ton of money to cover losses. Deleted our other characters in case someone added them.
---
Neither. It does remove them at random.
---
Same goes for dispelling harmful magic from friendly targets ( which is why people often times put up detect magic and hunters mark on sheeped/trapped enemies)
---
My headcanon for PvE realms was that the alliance and horde didn't actually end their truce.
---
Yea, I got a temp ban for this.
---
One thing I plan on doing on my priest is to grab Tailoring and Enchanting but only keep Enchanting long enough to make a wand then pitch it for herbalism. Then I will save up tons of herbs until I drop Tailoring for alchemy once I have the BOP Tailoring robes that are really good on Priest.  
---
I suspect doing Tailoring and Enchanting until you get your first wand will be good for a mage too. Then you can drop Enchanting for a gathering profession. Or not, because Enchanting and Tailoring go quite well together.
---
I didn’t know that there was a period of time where it cost money to switch between specs, while retaining the templates. I stopped at WOTLK, and don’t recall that being the case. I thought dual spec was only up front cost -&gt; change whenever. My memory could be bad though.
---
If you want to reach any of the high-end stuff you will have to login to do stuff you don't want to do. Unless you absolutely love farming or can organise gbid runs of course.
---
I mean these posts are neat and all but I don't think they're *that* exciting lol
---
You talk like an asshole, but how do you get out of combat w/o FD?
---
Disliking pvp =/= being diametrically opposed to classic PvP servers.
---
The mentality that ruined wow. Youd think 10 years of non stop sub losses would teach people like you better
---
infact all balance druids on the server ended up in the first kill KT guilds. You see everytime they ran out of mana they saw that guild was shit, so they found a better one. Repeat multiple times.
---
Combat gets dropped whenever two opposing players don't take any action against each other for a certain time. I think it's 6 seconds. Things like feign death and vanish also drop combat. This is how you end up eating or drinking in a duel. Your opponent can still be targeting you, but that won't be enough to put you back in combat. So once you're out of combat, you Shadowmeld and now your opponent loses you as a target and any spells they might have been casting against you are cancelled.

Does the Leatherworker get dibs on the Devilsaur leather or does the party roll on it?
---
So how am I supposed to provide evidence for something that I already conceded there is not evidence for?  If you actually read what I said it would be clear to you that I was just expressing an opinion.  An opinion that I freely say there is no evidence for.  Why do you get so butthurt about that?
---
It seems like you aren't appreciating the complexity and inherent difficulty of creating what they did from scratch. To say that there was no design philosophy is clearly hyperbole. It's not that there was no philosophy, and it's not that they didn't think about balance, it's that the philosophy was *different* and there were a mind-boggling number of unknowns. Without any existing data, other than benchmarking games like EQ, they couldn't predict every interaction of every class, ability, and/or item in the game. 
---
&gt; The hunter 31 pt surv talent was a bleed that did no damage.   
---
&gt; bosses had 8 debuff slots 
---
Both of these got changed during vanilla and aren't even relevant, since we're starting in 1.12, after their removal.
---
&gt; Shaman were supposed to be tanks. So were paladins and druids.  
---
In 1.12, shamans, paladins and druids *are tanks*. They just aren't *optimal* tanks, for various reasons. If you are doing anything short of 40-man raiding, you can use a tank other than a warrior, it just won't be quite as smooth. 
---
&gt; Literally half of the specs in the game don't work. They're complete trash. 
---
Again, so much hyperbole. Warriors, mages, priests, rogues, and warlocks all have three fully functional talent trees. Some of those trees aren't so useful in certain settings, but that's a good thing.
---
Druids, hunters, paladins and shamans have more problems, but it's not that they "don't work", it's that they're more niche. Survival hunters could be useful in PvP or in 5-mans where you need some extra CC. Tankadins and druids were fine from 5-mans up through ZG. Ret paladins and shamans could be devastating in pvp. 
---
Balance druids were terrible. I'll give you that one. But the stated design intention for the balance tree was to supplement Feral and Resto. 
---
This is what I'm really trying to get at here: **Raid performance is not the end-all-be-all metric for class balance. Balancing all classes around raid performance in every role leads to homogenization and takes away from the RPG elements of the game.**
---
This sort of thinking led to retail classes btw.
---
I plan to do this as well, but with my wife's priest when she doesnt want to play. I'm looking at Isoboxer right now.
---
You don't think they acknowledge what that dev said, was a major fuck up? The same way they acknowledged the "You think you do, but you don't" was one as well.
---
Also, if theres enchanters in the group and a BoE enchanting recipe drops then I feel like they should get to roll on it.
---
Again, this is assuming everyone on the server is a fresh 60 and it's not months after launch.
---
There's nothing Classic related you can buy so far. I'm guessing you're talking about WoW 15th anniversary thing with Rag figurine which is not connected to Classic in any way.
---
And if you're the "ackchtually" nerd that will point out the collector's edition from 15 years ago, fuck you.
---
First even on a PVP server there will still be a demand for  herbalism + alchemy, you have your cooldown transmutation skills and flask are used in PVP.
---
second as a healer you can run higher level dungeons that pay decently and running dungeon (if with a good group that doesn't wipe) can generate decent gold.
---
BGs shouldnt even exist
---
You can be all 3 as feral if you have int gear. Sure you will be a worse healer but chances are the healer than will join your group wont be heal speced anyway too
---
Or you just buy gold.
---
This actually sounds great because we're both interested in pvping as well. Thank you.
---
Very nice to have, but not a must whatsoever. 
---
Gives CC, burst and AOE to classes that won’t usually have that. Scopes for hunters.
---
I’d advise you to get herbalism and alchemy if you are going for money.
---
This was extremely helpful, thank you so much!
---
What kind of macros?
---
Not linen as in there isn't a quest for it or it doesn't award exp/rep
---
Tbh I could def be remembering wrong, these quests may not even give rep I just thought they did
---
If you helped kill Devilsaurs to farm leather. Do you not want to roll on it, or just let the LW hoard all the resources?
---
Raid schedules are so annoying, yeah.  I've only ever played on Pacific servers, and yet raids in every guild I've been in has been based around the sleep schedules of the east coasters in the raid.
---
You only made back 75% (3/4) of the invested gold??
---
Bug-report it. Seems like quite a serious bug. I guess you were in fullscreen?
---
Haha no promises while I'm still getting the hang of things, but I'll try!
---
Thanks for reminding me of the stats of the set bonus. I used it in my  comment.
---
Okay, thank you. I was just worried of popping a shield on him like I'd do on live and then screwing up his abilities or just leaving him as a sitting duck with no rage or something.
---
Both of these make me cringe. 
---
The amount of dudes playing as hot nigh elf babes is so cringy. "If I'm GoInG tO bE lOoKiNg At A cHaRaCtEr MoDeL iT bEtTeR hAvE a NiCe AsS cAuSe I'm NoT gAy I sWeAr!1!!11"
---
It is viable u just need to time it right
---
They will most likely just close the beta after the next stress test.
---
If you want to raid, Alliance has a much easier time clearing content due to Paladin buffs and healing output. An alliance raid with similar players will clear more bosses, faster and that can translate to PvP dominance later in a server's life.
---
Upgrade = Need  
---
AH/DE = Greed
---
Ya, during a fresh server launch and a few weeks after, any BoE that drops should be treated as a BoP for anyone that could use it as an upgrade and assuming they equip it right away to prove they aren't going to sell it.
---
I was! I was able to get back in really easily, but yeah, I bug reported it.
---
Nice, that's pretty awesome.
---
Early game though your mana efficiency will be shit and you'll run the risk of going out of mana very quickly due to nonstop heal casts. First off, I wouldn't focus on obtaining a lot of early game crit gear just proc illumination because most of it doesn't have +healing on top of crit. If you just get crit gear you'll proc illumination a lot but your base healing will be extremely low. To mitigate the low illumination procs I would focus on Int. Not only for a bigger mana pool to cast more heals but also for int to +healing conversion and more importantly the int to crit conversion. That way you can have some crit to proc illumination without gimping your +healing and enough mana to keep healing for when it doesn't proc. Early on I would also try to get some MP5 but I wouldn't gimp my int for a lot of it.  Plus, MP5 is hard to come by. It didnt really exist in early wow because developers still though spirit was the better stat, which was extremely bad design decision for pallies since they never stop casting and don't benefit much from spirit.  So for me I would focus: Int&gt; +heal &gt;mp5 &gt; crit
---
Hmm, I'll google it!
---
Roll enchanting for dungeons, and herbalism for gathering.  You'll be fine on gold.
---
I’m not discrediting the beta.  The beta is clearly accurate for 1.12 numbers. I’m simply suggesting that the many hundreds of people who share the opinion that the beta numbers are a lot lower than they remember are also not at fault.  That’s all.
---
This is just a *little* bit different.
---
You're comparing multiple patches, over multiple iterations (expansions) of an ever-expanding version of the game.
---
We're getting *one* final patch (1.12, or 1.13 as its sometimes dubbed) to last for what could potentially be the entire life-span of this version of the game.
---
I realize the #nochanges crowd has a collective aneurism anytime balance patching is suggested, but at current we have to operate under the assumption that there will be no post-Naxx content. Party because we've gotten 2 conflicting responses from Blizz, and partly because it's a long ways away and this subreddit gets heated AF around the topic. So if we're playing this patch for literal *years*, I 100% think some light tuning is appropriate.
---
Bring Ele / SP / Oomkin mana consumption and/or recovery in line and viable. Give Hunters a slight buff to scaling via their skills, give Enhancement a buff of some sort without changing their playstyle. Give Paladin's a friggin' taunt. That kind of stuff.
---
No reason we should pigeon hold ourselves to the current balance for perpetuity.
---
Yea. You won’t feel obligated to farm gear, farm mats, farm rep, farm everything. That’s totally not classic. You right.
---
I've had many moments where I've thought "heck, I'll just make another priest again." and then I shake my head and remind myself "no! you've always wanted to play Rogue! This is your chance!"
---
Which makes no sense because the classic team doesn't have any game designers because the game is already designed
---
Thank you for this, this cleared things up for me for sure!
---
Can confirm as well.
---
I don't remember being able to do that in Vanilla though. I remember saving energy for a snd before the mob died
---
Drakestone is 7 spell power + 20 random spell power.
---
Asmongold is a complete idiot. People aren't active on the beta because of the level cap. He's exhausted the shit out of everything there is to do other than level an alt. His view count isn't as high because people don't wanna see the same old shit and he's equating that to the death of classic wow?
---
I know I works - I just think because of the insanely accurate timing you need it’s not going to be that much of a thing for many people
---
Honestly the issue isnt class balance, its debuff slots.
---
I find dual melee far easier to micro imo. Like ret pala / warrior or feral druid / warrior. You can just have a macro like
---
    /cast shred
---
    /assist party1
---
    /follow party1
---
bound to your druid on the same key as heroic strike. A second key to heal and that's all you need 1-60.
---
Ah, is it bad if I didn't understand this? I mean I get the tank saying haha np, I can do this buddy, but what made him sweat all of a sudden?
---
Blizzard not inviting more to beta probably means that they are backed up on bug-reports. That's the only reason I can see.
---
I guess that sorta makes sense.... kinda
---
Probably because they don't care if jimmy gets to practice his leveling routes.
---
What if you're in a group in Ungoro, and you kill a devilsaur. You have a LW in the group that can skin it.
---
Do you roll on the leather or does the LW keep it?
---
Don't do it in the open world. Priests can grind DM and any healer can do jump runs in there. If you are a paladin then consider specing holy/prot and do super quick strath/scholo runs. I know nothing about shamans but I'm sure they have their ways too. 
---
Later on in the game you can pair up with a decently geared warrior/rogue and grind the chimaeras super quick. The meat drops at about 50% and is worth well over 10g each. Me and a mate grinded out two stacks of meat in like 30 minutes.
---
Jeff lost the keys. Hoping he finds them before August. I'll keep you posted.
---
they know we're gonna play it either way so
---
Pretty much. This "YOU WILL BE DESTROYED IN PVP UNLESS YOU'RE AN ENGINEER" stuff I keep seeing is absurd.
---
So basically you want BFA
---
!remindme 57 days
---
1.8 attack speed?
---
Unironically hunter weapons
---
I love Aubrey Plaza, I love World of Warcraft, but I hate this. This is PANDERING.
---
Blessing of Might is also really strong on a warrior. Though Power Word: Fortitude is good, it has a much longer duration and can be buffed by others.
---
No i was talking about the anniversary edition. You're right tho, its not really related to classic but some media outlets labeled it as such. My bad
---
PW:S is also quite mana ineffective, so it's basically an emergency heal.
---
Stacking gold to pay for your respec
---
Because they don’t need any more beta testers. It’s counter-productive to invite more than needed because it increases the chance of someone getting burned out.
---
Because they already have enough people reporting bugs and don't need more. It doesn't help them if their dev team gets flooded with reports. It's a beta to test and fix bugs. Not a demo.
---
of course wow retail has over 1 million subscribers.. you could easily infer that from the quarterly earning statements.
---
Not just threat, it's also just very mana inefficient. power word shield makes a lot of sense to cast on yourself while soloing, because 
---
- you don't take that much damage anyways
---
- power word shield prevents pushback on spells
---
- and it's quite dangerous as a healer to wait till you are taking damage and try to cast big slow heals. 
---
But for healing a warrior? none of that applies. You expect him to take enough damage to justify big heals. You are spending a lot more mana because now you use your entire rotation for dps AND provide extra mana to heal him, and it's not dangerous to let a warrior lose some health, as you have no pushback, and he probably has pretty good max health and loses health slower, due to stacking stamina and having good mitigation. 
---
So, for healing a warrior, you want to just cast big slow heals on him, as long as you don't risk him dying.
---
It does make sense in some tough pulls, to prebubble a warrior (before the pull, not after he throws the first knife or charges) just to have more total mana for the fight and more burst survivability to get off your big heals.
---
But power word shield is not your go to spell for healing other people.
---
4chan "leaks" are their own genre of bullshit at this point.  Take it with a grain of salt.  That said, if classic is a success than the next logical step would be BC phases. Blizzard knows this.  "In development" can mean a lot of things.
---
I'm going to equip myself with a little, Four Wheels of Fury!
---
No clue. On Betas for expansions they usually invite more and more people the closer they get to release. I’m not stressing though. If I have a huge itch to play something similar to Classic before release, I have a high level mage on a private server to you around with. 
---
It’s just two months away, anyways!
---
I'm going to play.  Didn't start playing until end of TBC, so vanilla will be all new for me.  However, as someone who has mained a Belf Ret Paladin since TBC, I want to see what the alliance has to offer while playing a Human Holy Pally.
---
Also, I want exalted reps, even the grindy ones.  Shendralar, timbermaw, ravenholdt!  Bring it on!
---
&gt; most importantly, LEARN AGGRO RADIUSES AND KEEP THEM IN MIND. The reason people hate rogues in dungeons is not because of their dps, most people I suspect don't even use damage meters. They hate rogues body pulling extra mobs because they are low level and stand way out where they shouldn't be.
---
I'll keep that in mind! Coming from healing, I will probably stay far behind and sap extra mobs on pull.
---
&gt; (if you go alchemy, you have to go herbalism IMHO, which means you cannot go skinning). 
---
I'm thinking skinning + leatherworking while leveling for extra armor and money, then swapping to herb + alch at 60.
---
&gt; Because they don’t need any more beta testers.
---
Weird thing to say with servers being almost dead.
---
It’s fundmental to humans because we take in so much data before making any action. Classic WoW is presenting a problem and the information we have to solve it just sends people in a mental spiral. Some days you’ll be on top of the circle, thinking about rolling a priest because shadow is cool, then you’ll be reminded that you’ll be healing in raids and start to think about rolling a mage. Only to realize frost bolt spam sounds terrible and if you want to do damage why not just roll a warrior. AND AROUND WE GO. 
---
There is no final answer. You won’t feel satisfied when you start. There are tons of wisdom in old stories about how to overcome this issue and I think it boils down to two different conclusions. 1) Don’t learn any new data, which is impossible since we already know all the faults of each class already. 2) Just do it. Pick a class and never look back.
---
I would really like to see theses come out as updates or something
---
This is the direction they should’ve gone with expansions
---
I simple ‘wrong’ would have done just fine...
---
Honestly at this point, don't you think it's better to hold off?  
---
Outside of finding a bug that has yet to be found, I'm sure there's a couple ;) , and/or perhaps goofing around with a friend who is in the beta, wouldn't you prefer to wait for the real thing to come out?
---
What's the difference between daily quests and biweekly raids
---
I'm more concerned with the fact that someone teleported by alt tabbing.  You can't see how this will be broken? *coughABGatescough*
---
If I were in this situation and you needed a BoE that paid for half my level 40 mount and a /inspect showed that you were in fact using it I wouldn't have any second thoughts on it. Need is need.
---
You aren't providing a 45g service here, so if you needed it knowing that you were going to out-roll his greed roll so you can sell it, you'd be a ninja and a dickweed on top of it.
---
On this date you can log in and make 3 characters to reserve name (need to be subbed)
---
BoE drops are always need.
---
Probably so they dont burn out and then are discouraged from starting from scratch at launch. Also fewer costs and a more sizable feedback.
---
As many have said, you will be called a noob at some point, but you will absolutely be fine. WoW is a social game and it's pretty chill. When I played in Vanilla, there were tons of relaxed guilds that let anyone join. Sure you will see the "elite" guilds that are super specific and min/max everything, but those types of people exist in all games. You WILL be able to find a raiding guild that will let you join and bring you along to raids. You might not clear MC in the first month of your guild trying it, but you will be able to experience it. Given enough time playing the game, you will likely eventually clear MC, Ony, BWL even. Naxx is a beast and will take a lot of time for folks to learn but even it will be doable.   
---
Don't worry yourself about min/maxing. Don't worry about being called a noob or being passed on stuff. It happens to us all. Find a guild that you get along with and you will have tons of fun for a long time. One of my old guilds was basically family for a while.
---
I lost it at the remote control up the ass
---
That would have a significant impact on how the game plays and it's difficulty.
---
Exactly the same here.  4H was such a major cock-block.
---
I wanna beat Sapp and KT.  Beyond that, I wanna get a Legendary.  Then I'll have officially completed my Vanilla bucket list.
---
This isn't really relevant to the original question, but I also want to throw it out there that as a Nelf, you can tame a plainstrider in the barrens, put it on stay in the middle of crossroads, then shadowmeld up. Someone will come along and attack it thinking its a bugged mob, and you can gank them.
---
Fair enough
---
Does armor not work in PvE?
---
Ozzy Osborne did a commercial featuring undead warlock, because that is what he actually played in game. Not sure how long or seriously.
---
Those aren't in contradiction. The servers being dead means
---
A) players are done testing, and 
---
B) they are being burned out
---
Good job squishing those bugs :) If you have time. Try to reproduce it and post how in the EU or US classic forums. Seems like it can be abused quite hard if it does what I think it does.
---
iirc, this was actually a thing in vanilla, lagging the game by repeatedly tabbing in and out of the game to get into places where you shouldn't be.
---
Probably because they're laughing their asses off watching all these people with no impulse control freak out about having to wait two months.
---
To be fair (Not a Trump fan full disclosure) a lot of his negative approval ratings are coming from people who DID vote for him.
---
He never had the majority in the open spotlight, but a lot of people who weren't openly for him still ended up voting for him just to "Rock the boat" that is the status quo.
---
That's what ended up getting him elected, the people who wanted to see what could happen if a reality TV star got president.
---
"If it's an upgrade, need."
---
I tell this to my groups every time.
---
or "Roll need if you need."
---
Playing horde. I played a lot of wow on my main through vanilla, BC, and wotlk. I never had the horde experience on those. So I'm planning on experiencing the pre-cataclysm horde stuff
---
Play the game without being a mouse clicking keyboard turner.  It was the only way I knew how to play from May 2005 through to the end of TBC.  I didn't learn keybinds until I returned at the end of Wrath.
---
&gt;Technically, since War Stomp is the first thing in the cast sequence, it is accessible in one press so I don't bind it anywhere else.
---
this is one of the areas i have been looking at my own bindings lately, and already made some huge improvements. i played a warrior for years manually swapping stances like some sort of weirdo. then during the last stress test, it struck me that by making an overpower macro that swapped to battle stance first (and always keeping that off the stance bar), i could just use one press of that macro to swap to battle stance. suddenly one of my most used keybinds was pulling double duty (freeing up another highly valuable keybinding) and actually making me faster at doing the stuff i wanted them for anyway.
---
what i'm saying is, i hope some day you decide to do all this with a warrior and share it with us :D
---
it's dirty but so are orcs
---
Sure, if you're tanking lol
---
Nah, I can’t wait for classic and will play it a ton. But I’ve played vanilla enough to know it’ll be huge for a month, people will hit the 30-40 wall and quit the game or become a keeper. But a lot of people dont have the time or will to continue
---
Oh good I'm glad someone got it, I got banned from the official forums for that lol
---
Isnt Orb reserve just because Warriors dont actually need anything from strat live? So if you still need items, they're not in strat live and you'll be running a different dungeon. Unless ofcourse you get the orb(s). Druid and Paladin dont really need tank loot either but they've like 3 solid HEALING items they could use from there thus giving them a reason to just run it for the loot. Other classes would need DPS loot too. So aka Tank gets the orb.

---
When you say “almost dead” how many people are you referring to approximately? I’m not subbed currently so had no chance for the beta and therefore don’t have first-hand frame of reference. MMO beta testing is tricky because you have a world normally populated by tens of thousands concurrently, and you definitely don’t want to Mirror that number with a beta test.
---
That said, if they needed more beta testers or more diverse testers, they can always invite more people, so it would serve to reason that they have all they need.
---
How long do you think you'll be able to stay a noob if you're playing that much?
---
Do some research and study as you're playing, and you'll be an expert in no time.
---
Oh no! I want classic for other classes.
---
Also disarm.
---
It's a game publisher right?
---
How do you create a situation where they don’t take action against you for 6 seconds? Run? Assuming this is in wPvP or a BG
---
Disc is great, much more Mana sustain. I'd rather have Mana sustain over +healing cause a good healer should be able to mitigate overheating with lower ranks and keep up with the big heals as needed.
---
I mean...we all did.  Two wings one night, two wings the next, then a third night for progression, as needed.
---
You could clear Spider wing pretty quickly.  Abomination wing wasn't too bad either.  Plague could be pretty time-consuming until people got their heads' out of their asses.  Undead wing...gd, that one took forever.
---
Wow, what a bunch princesses who obviously aren’t even old enough to get the reference.
---
None of your post makes sense and you already have the answer. Let's see your friends want to play PVP server you don't. Let's see your friends are taking the the week off and you aren't. Let's see your friends plan on speed leveling and not waiting for you yet they want you to be their tank. Yeah okay.
---
Really depends on the nature of the fight, the duration, and the number of mobs.
---
And at least you get to trade plate that the other doesn't want due to stats.
---
Depends, if I'm there specifically to help kill them then we would share, since without me they would get nothing, or they wouldn't need me to help.
---
This is markedly different from a random drop.
---
If someone could "help" me farm Arcane Crystals the same would apply.
---
Help being the key term. There's no other reason to specifically kill Devilsaurs other than their leather too, so even external reasons can't be considered.
---
Everytime i saw this page mentioned in one of the class discords, people always pointed out how terrible the page is. IDK personally and haven't even looked in to it but they definitelly scared me of seeing this as a reliable source. Comments here aren't helping either. I think im gonna pass
---
It's the sacrifice you make to wear nature resist gear in this fight
---
I'd say less of trolled an entire country and more proved how retarded and gullible a large percentage is
---
Chimeras in DM?
---
The issue is that paladin tanks suck and don’t get picked for raid groups. 99% of them will be forced into a healing role in any meanginful endgame content.
---
Everyone who matters is already in the beta.
---
"end game content".  Bro, have you seen MC?  Whatever PVP you find for a couple of days might be fun, then you get over that real quick.  So they are basically going to ask people to farm and do MC for like 4 months before anything else interesting happens...Classic may well crash and burn.  I hope not, but you never know.
---
Perception definitely saved me a ton for pvp. Don’t really remember the radius but definitely far away enough that you can catch the rogue before they get you. 
---
Not sure I would say OP but it’s nice to have.
---
this is for mobs 3 levels higher than you (63)
---
raid bosses are this level
---
I always wanted to get there...  
---
Also kinda sad you could never swim down to the outside of the tunnel.

Yeah she's so fucking annoying to me. She tries so hard to be quirky and random. Appeals to the masses I guess

---
Not every class needs to be good at everything. Mages bring an enormous amount of utility as compared to a warrior. A raid without decurse is going to have a hard time even if it's theoretical DPS is much higher. Those utility abilities allow other classes to fight more efficiently. 
---
It's about teamwork, not individual class "balance"
---
It's not really a dumb rule if you understand why it has to be that way.
---
I mean I'm sure the rule could definitely be redrafted but you'd have to have something to balance out the differential in population between each state.
---
Or else you end up having the most populated states and municipalities holding all the power in the elections. You'd have candidates only campaigning in the most populated areas and tackling only the issues effecting those areas.
---
People in California wouldn't care about a campaign issue that deals with issues in rural farming areas. You would need to have something in place that makes sure votes coming from underpopulated areas are just as powerful than the larger number of votes coming from metropolitan hubs.
---
If you don't mind me asking, how are you making these?  
---
Looks great!
---
Something like that [yeah](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVMGzfbzZiqG0obth)
---
Yoo just watched some videos, some people are saying the private servers are incorrect because the elite wardens should have a net throw to immobilize you (really tough for aoe farming )
---
Do you know if this was the case in 1.12 or if they will have net throw in classic??
---
any ideas for it, it would have to be pretty small
---
Polymorph, Freezing Trap, Wyvern Sting, Fear, Mind Control (not sure about that one), Repentance, Frost Nova, Blind...
---
or yeah, just kite them or line-of-sight them.
---
I'm confused
---
there will be lots of new players who don't know what they are doing.  just be honest about this when you group with people and they will usually be nice enough to teach you what is required.
---
the worse thing a new person can do is hide their noobness and wipe the group
---
Yeah but you can't purify a blind off yourself. Shedding blind instantly is huge in PvP.
---
why?
---
paint
---
What's the yellow icon that looks like some sort of winged helmet?  I've seen it on a few of your maps, but never saw a key for it.  World boss?
---
I have no proof, but my mom used to raid with vin diesel during classic. I didnt believe her n her guildies, but years n years later Vin posted a video of him and paul walker playing. Vin diesels character was exactly what my mom told me he played
---
Oh sweet summer child. That helmet is BiS for a good chunck of TBC.
---
&gt;but chances are the healer than will join your group wont be heal speced anyway too
---
Doesn't matter as long they can ress me after a bad pull or patrol catching us off guard. Even better if you can play DPS, as now you can be a jolly joker helping out the healer or tank as you see fit.
---
Well trolls prey on the gullible lol
---
just play spell power ret
---
Global warming worked it’s way into Azeroth too. I blame the Tauren.
---
I don't trust anyone with a name so generic. "Hey guys, Warrior_Male_5 here!"
---
should we tell this guy about the hours of farming required for raid consumes or the painful rep grinds?
---
No idea, we´ll just have to see when we get there and ajust if its true. theres tons of other grinds to do anyway, just not as good.
---
No need I'm only missing holy shock
---
Your forgetting one thing. I quit a month into TBC but my guild and elite players like Hulksmash continued to dominate into WotlK, my guild merged with Death N Taxes during WotlK also by that time but I was long gone. 
---
You are viewing it in a vanilla vacuum, those players I said were elite continued to be elite for many more years. The Main tank of my vanilla guild has to be in the Top 3 most accomplished Tanks on Earth, he has main tanked every single raid boss from Onyxia to current patch in BfA. I still talk to some of the core players from my vanilla guild and they are still elite to this day, and I am still average but don't mind. 
---
What I predict happening in Classic WoW is that there will be 500-1,000 "Ultra-hardcore" players that will fill out 10-20 guilds and they will destroy all the raid content. But 99% of players will get crushed in AQ/Naxx just like in vanilla.
---
I started as a rogue right after the initial launch of the game. I switched to a healing priest after I spent many evenings in Ironforge with at least a dozen other rogues begging for group space. 
---
I have hopes that this dynamic will be different in classic.
---
Yeah I saw how much exp that gets per hour! Nuts.
---
The Berenstain Furbolgs
---
No, on the isle of dread in the same zone.
---
I think alot will hate this but an daily quest zone like tbc one outside of sunwell plus 3 towers for pvp like the obe in hellfire that had an daily pvp quest for honor.
---
In vanilla I grinded exalted rep to get the tiger mount as a human paladin.. that combined with my rare pvp set made me a God.  
---
I don't know if I have it in me to do the rep grind again.. well, we'll see!
---
Someone's got to do a Thunderbluff next.
---
For what it's worth, from a lore perspective, the world kind of *should* have an Alliance bias.  The Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes are all native to Azeroth.  For the Horde, the Forsaken and Orcs both only arrived recently, and the Tauren are more nomadic than imperialistic.  That just leaves the Trolls, who admittedly should have a significant presence.
---
But from a gameplay perspective, yeah.  These maps have been Alliance-centric for sure.
---
&gt;Do you guys think new players will have an actual chance to enjoy the game to the fullest without being called a noob?
---
No. You are guaranteed to be called a noob at some point. Your best bet would be to join a guild early and let everyone know you're new.
---
The real problem isn't that you're a new player, it's that people *won't know* you're new and will expect you to know everything. Once you let them know you're a noob they'll probably help the fuck out of you.
---
Yes for me dailies were the start of the downfall of classic and the biggest reason while i will never agree that TBC is better than classic.
---
C'mon man. Do I really have to stop shitposting in order to explain this? 
---
If you really think that it was only "those 3 guilds" a.k.a. a very small portion of the playerbase. Well, then you are actually right. It was only a small portion compared to the overall playerbase.
---
But still significant more than just "those 3" professional guilds . I like to remind you of "Elitist Jerks". Their forum was very active and basically quoted by every in-depth guide of the time, because they did the calculations to find the optimal way for things. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
So saying noone did minmax is like saying noone plays RP-servers. Sure the overall amount is small compared to the whole. But it is still enough to warrant recognition ( like RP-servers).
---
Wether you *need* to minmax or not was not even part of the discussion as far as I am concerned. You definitly do not. But that does not change its existence.
---
&amp;nsbp;
---
I can understand that you wanted to make fun of the sort of people that would even snort snail slime if it increased their dps, but then stand in the fire and die.
---
But surviving 'is* part of minmaxing. As the old saying says : 
---
"Dead folks do **no** damage."
---
it's called 'enchant weapon - spell power', but it gives +30 spell damage and healing
---
I'd say about 6 months before they turn on the cash shop, but I could be wrong. It might be on immediately, it might be turned on after Naxx.
---
Game server engine is one giant while loop which processes everything 20 times per second.
---
In one part of the engine is reading new network transactions from clients. There could be 1000-10000 new transactions. You will read them one by one. Some of them will be for movement some for casting spells. Then save them into arrays. Movement transactions to movement transaction array, spell transactions to spell transaction array etc. So everything is actually done in batches no matter what. Movement transactions are order independend so you can safely process them in random order. Spell transactions are order dependend so you have to process them two times. First time for casting second time for applying effect.
---
Lets imagine old vanilla wow servers tick only 10 times per second it would still be 100 ms maximum.
---
Spell batching is term invented in 2019. I actually doubt wow devs know what they are doing or what batching means.

Classic wow, it's everything the body needs. Nice one.

I feel you.  What I meant is if you have two identically geared/specced players, the one with the greater skill will win almost every time. Whereas in pokemon, it becomes an odds game. Of course the last pokemon I played was ruby and sapphire but I think the point still stands :)
---
sorry, should have made the key clearer, it a neutral goblin town

How come Paul Walker is missing from that list. They played with Vin together.

I'm sure there are more celebrities who play(s)ed WoW, but not on this list, or known.

Roll need on very expensive drops because you will get ninjad otherwise. You should say “all need” in party very quickly so people know you’re acting in good faith. If everyone else has rolled greed, definitely roll greed.
---
Totally. I'm loving all these.
---
While that is cool, the fact that all 3 druid specs play mostly the same way in PvP and usually is just a outsustain battle, that is what keeps most people away from that class, of course paired with them being a subpar raid healer.
---
Damn 1000G, I see you

definitely a classic, but I counter with:

---
Your character and progress is going to be deleted anyways so why would it matter?
---
Yea so weird that people arnt playing this beta test 24 hours a day. Why would they ever log off and do other things when there’s a beta to play?
---
Alright then yeah, I stand corrected.
---
That sounds like a totally unreliable leak.

Also to add, you play on ez mode private servers, nobody cares what you did on there.

---
Dwarf. Because it's better.
---
Agree with that guy, although fury &amp; prot warriors aren't the best in PvP.
---
You will but, unlike with lets say dailies where you feel left behind for not doing it every single day. In classic you can just not do what you don't feel like today and catch up whenever you want. There is stuff i will certainly leave till i have a day off and then do that thing more and use my limited time on workdays for stuff i enjoy more. Thats not how it is today in BfA and to some extent older expansions too including TBC where every time i loged on i would like no friends, im not gonna do a dungeon now because i still need to do the dailies otherwise im left behind. You aren't forced to do them by any means but there is no denying that you are crippling yourself if you dont.
---
Ah, that makes perfect sense.  I definitely see the goblin head now.
---
welp
---
This is very well done bravo
---
the frequency?
---
Shit that's Huhuran! Don't underestimate NR gear!
---
Holy is the best raiding spec for paladin and they will be sought after. Good buffs, top healing, cleansing, wipe prevention etc. A lot of 40 man raids will want around 4-5 for the blessings
---
I dont remember the exact format, but its essentially three lines
---
Line 1: Showtooltip X
---
Line 2: Cast pickpocket
---
Line 3: Cast X
---
Where X is a stealth ability. You will have one of these for ambush, sap, etc
---
You invite new beta testers to replace those who are "done" and/or burned out.
---
Annnnnd I’m in tears. Oh my god.
---
Alright, that's just plain hate speech. The same could be said to any dedicated gamer.
---
The guy who played Superman in man of steel almost missed his audition for the part because of Wow

I know Blizz devs as I worked in the industry briefly. Their NDA includes a lot more than "you're fired". 0 chance this person is being truthful. 
---
This is just another of a million attention seeing liars on 4chan.

I don't know the servers are dead
---
Also to add, you havent toched a hard raid by modern standards, nobody cares what you did in 2006.
---
Stop telling people not to have fun lol. He just told you some people enjoy it and you are trying to say he is wrong?
---
Well at least that makes sense
---
everyone is a noob some time ... doing wow classic before bfa can be good or bad, either it will make bfa look really good or really bad depending on your core requirements

If taken literally, why would "duel-boxing" mean dueling yourself? There is nothing in the name to suggest that, just sayin.

Sorry, I wasn't clear. I'd buy BC and wotlk with no changes. I'd also buy a new 2.0 and 3.0 if they offered it probably.
---
Resetting would be great too, because I don't think I'm going to get a lot of time to play classic for awhile, so coming back in 4 years to a brand new server would be amazing for me.
---
AoE will just supplement your normal questing. You can handle plenty of mobs with seal of light solo, and with your friend around you will probably have trouble finding enough mobs on the screen to make it hard. It's defiantly viable, around level 50 it's really nice since thrash blade works well even at 60 which means you don't have to keep trying to upgrade your weapon as often as ret pallys do to stay competitive. The only real downside is you are kind of a bitch in pvp while leveling; generally you have to play the long con to simply survive and get off reckoning stacks, assuming of course that people aren't just kiting and laughing at you because you have no gap closer like repentance or holy shock in your kit.  
---
20 points in holy is the minimum requirement to raid heal. If you want to go 31 into holy do it because you want holy shock. You can still tank dungeons well with any standard holy build; at the end of the day tanking mainly just comes down to having some good plate gear on deck.
---
It's not about "free water"
---
it's about having to spend 15-20 seconds sitting and drinking every 2-3 mobs.
---
Yeah it could mean fighting two duels at once!
---
Another good one would be the Ravenholt Manor
---
Ironically it ruins the very "shitshow" this guy is hoping for.
---
This is why I'm very against layering.  You might have to merge fewer realms later on, but the chaos and fun of a packed server will be missed, and the bonds that are formed at low level will be severed as you are unlikely to encounter that person again due to layering.
---
I do believe you lose everything
---
&gt; can guarantee crits with recklessness to the point where luck is a non factor.
---
A 30min cd is really ought to be left out of consideration. It's far too long to really count. I also don't count lay on hands.
---
&gt; I mean warrior has many more ways to mitigate damage than you listed
---
And which would that be? Shield Wall and retaliation? More 30 min cds. Disarm is the only other ability I can think of.
---
&gt; Never mind I can rocket helm death ray you for 2-10k dmg whenever I want.
---
That's engi and completely pointless in this argument. What's stopping the paladin from rocket helm + death ray you?
---
About 5 days if I do the math
---
I would actually be ok with them adjusting stats/mechanics and getting a better balance across specs.  
---
Imagine viable Druid and paladin tanks in raids. 
---
It would the theorycrafting community something to do.
---
And those new testers report the same bugs that are being worked on. That would be very counterproductive.
---
Nobody cares about what you did in modern WoW, it's one of the most irrelevant games there is.
---
You can mever try to farm a random BoE. They're random for that reason. Devilsaur leather is not random.
---
From a lore perspective, the Goblins should still be completely aligned with the Horde. Which means Winterspring, Azshara, Tanaris, The Shimmering Flats, and the Stranglethorn Vale should all belong to them with either separate and smaller or no Alliance outposts. That includes Ratchet too.
---
The whole "we decided to play both sides" was just something convenient for WoW so the Alliance would have footholds in many of these places.
---
It's not actually that bad, in Heal spec, that means your pretty much never really going to be in in much trouble while grinding mobs, your health and mana remain pretty high.
---
If you can't instant kill a healer, they are a pain in the but to actually kill.
---
Some people just skip us rather that fight us 1v1.
---
Obviously groups don't have this issue, but lone gankers are likely to just move on.
---
It's not 10 buttons when you use modifiers lol :p
---
Please stop posting everything these clowns do. Thank you.
---
Dungeons did not become obsolete in vanilla and tbc. You still needed to do them to gear up for raiding. The skip everythingexcept the latest raid tier is also a phenomen of wrath and cata.
---
The do : it's called MAKING MONEY.
---
With cash shop in Classic...they LOSE MONEY.

There are a few decent... not great healing chests that aren’t robes out there. Plate of the shaman king from LBRS and tunic of the crescent moon from stratholme.

That's great to hear. I hope they don't ever allow /follow in BGs
---
Best city when it's BURNED TO THE GROUND MAYBE!
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Another post by someone who has never played classic.
---
Is it me or do the streams become like night talk shows in tv with co moderator?
---
I want to raid.
---
When I played I was still on a 56k modem and it was just not feasible for me to stay up at night and tie up the phone line so that I could raid. Not to mention how long it took me to get the required FR gear that almost every guild required before I could even go. I remember going on forums and looking at what different guilds required for me to join haha good times. As a kid I had no idea how really to get that gear.
---
I remember I did get to go on a few Molten Core runs. I think we downed the first 3 bosses and it took literally 4 hours. I stayed up way to long and tied up the phone way longer than I was supposed too but I loved it. Felt pretty guilty afterwards though haha
---
Yeah no, there are plenty of logs, 90% are topped by fury warriors.
---
Got [Nendis](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Nendis) somewhere?
---
that is good news!
---
dual duel boxing is that, not duel boxing...
---
Do yourself a favour and read up on the raids a bit before joining a guild. The mechanics of vanilla raids are super simple. So it's usually just a single gimmick you need to focus on. Lucifron needs dispels and decurses, Magmadar fears which range can avoid, Geddon puts a bomb on a random player who will have to run out etc. 
---
But above all; ask! If you are unsure about anything, just ask!
---
Oh, you look forward to chaotic fun at low levels as you clash with people on your server that you'll be fighting alongside or against for many levels to come?
---
Nope.  Layering.  You'll have just the right amount of people in your starting zone to make things easy for you.  Of course, you're not likely to see any of them ever again, since next time you all log on you'll be in different layers.
---
It was disabled to combat bots, screwing over multi-boxers was just a side effect.
---
I'm more bothered by the Warlock class symbol but Mage in the name.
---
I have no intentions in triggering anyone respect the art for what it is, bare with me brothers and sisters because paintings of other cities will be made! &lt;3
---
Yeah you can. Just kill things that have it on the loot thale until one drops
---
&gt;that makes us even able to play the game at launch
---
Yeah cause god forbid there have been plenty of games launched WoW included that didn't figure out alternative ways to keep their game online at launch lmfao.
---
Thank you elitist assholes. You are solely responsible for that kind of threads. Really thank you for scaring people over an easy game, where everyone should just be playing whatever he wants to play, whenever he wants.
---
Those kind of threads are sad.
---
Well, this is why I said they first need to CHANGE the game, so they can CHANGE the player base.
---
Wrath is CLEARLY not Vanilla, not the Vanilla player base.
---
And there won't be a Wrath. There won't be TBC either.
---
It will be Classic+, and the player base will be Vanilla-like.
---
As in "rejecting BS cash shop" player base.
---
tier two set for warriors is easily my favorite, the paladin t2 is nice too
---
The rule is everyone rolls need so there are no misunderstandings.
---
Yep I remember buying one of those back in the day but from the vendor not the AH. It was a lot of gold my nextdoor neighbor told me I should "invest" still slightly salty
---
Shadowmeld (NE Racial) pairs well with Prowl (Cat skill).  In wPvP and BGs it's all about getting the drop on the other person.  A melded hunter can still eat in stealth after a close battle unlike an orc who has to either run or risk a quick rematch.  Also, since shadowmeld is on a 10s cd, one can do a lot of Melded Aimed shots to open an engagement and again, the initiator usually wins.
---
I think subscriptions being more consistent and selling server transfers are what they are aiming for. Retail will have the larger player base in the long run even though this sub thinks 100million people are gonna play classic for years on end.
---
&gt;many servers developed a culture that accepted players rolling need on valuable world drops--literally every time I've seen a world drop in a PuG, someone in the group (sometimes myself) has suggested everyone roll need.
---
Yes,  I loved when a rogue suggest that for a caster BoE...
---
Nah always need, then there are never any problems after.
---
It's still random. Not to mention if you're farming it for yourself its need. If you're farming it for money its greed. So fucking simple.
---
Def stance, shield block, demo shout, thunderclap, shield bash just to name a few. LGG. 
---
Death ray gets crit from recklessness so its way better on a warrior.
---
This is just becoming a duel in verbal form.
---
Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay is also an incredible game. I don't know if it's considered a "movie video game" but if it is, it's probably one of the best ones of those ever made. Vin Diesel put a lot of work into getting it made.
---
Stellaris so much replay value
---
Quitting is only logical when the level cap is 40 and there are only 2-4 players per layer which ruins wpvp. I'm in head to toe BIS and don't have shit else to do since there are no horde.
---
A ruins of lordaeron one would be incredible
---
Mira's Song for Prot Paladin vs Thrash Blade? Don't think that's right.
---
Jonathan davis from korn was addicted to vanilla and meth
---
Have they fixed many of the horrendous bugs from 3-4 months ago?
---
You definitely need it as certain classes or specs to take down a competent mage in a 1v1. Being able to rez your healer as a hunter (other than fails) can easily save a 5 man from breaking up after a rough pull late in the dungeon. It’s not necessary but it has hype for good reason.
---
can't pull threat if u never hit the boss Kapp
---
Holy Paladin would be the closest.  
---
They are mostly targeting +healing.  Crit and mp/5 are more valuable point for point then int, but int is often cheaper on itemization budget, such that int is more typically the 2nd stat you are looking for on gear.  This is because paladins get twice the crit per int of other casters, and then having a int modifier in their tree making the crit:int ratio even better.  
---
For mage warlock the number is 59 or 59.5:1 int:crit, for paladins it is 29 or 29.5:1.  Then paladin has divine int, and presumably kings in raid so really more like 25.6:1 int:crit.
---
The greatest city there ever was or ever will be?
---
Quite many people are going to multibox in classic, me including.
---
I am going druid (tank for dungeons/healer PVP and raids), priest (healer), mage, warlock, warlock.
---
Follow work everywhere except for bgs.
---
You don't need to switch between screens and with isboxer or hotkeynet or some other similar program you can control both from 1 screen easily.
---
Most multiboxers intend to lvl in dungeons because it is a pain to quest with multiple characters and dungeons is supposed to be really fast, but with 2 characters you could do either.
---
Not too painful to quest with just 2 characters.
---
Fast to get group for dungeons when you only need dps, even if someone leave it should only take seconds to find a replacement, great if you have a warlock to do dungeons with then for summon. (setting up healing would be the hardest part)
---
Nah, them's Horde qualities.
---
Still giant rocks that are invisible to other players on multiplayer.  Still a couple bugs other than that, but nothing too game breaking.  There was a summer update.
---
My guess is the Internal alpha showed a fairly stable build with the port over to the new client and not many things would be needed from external testers. This would make sense since they are not actually creating anything new, but rather porting over the complete data on a new client. It’s more of a compatibility exercise thing. 
---
The Beta seems more like an exclusive hype fest exercise than an actual beta test tbh.
---
Not to mention immolate takes a debuff slot per warlock, and that could be used for something else.
---
I agree with you, and I'm rolling a hunter so I'd love to see better scaling. What annoys me is people knowingly complaining about the balance of warriors when they have a very good idea of how warriors will be balanced in this game. Things won't really be a surprise.
---
That's the one I can't wait to see
---
The rep reward could be mount for exalted, pet for revered and proffesion patterns for honored.
---
Could be 10 quest but only able to do 5 per day so you could mix it up abit and do spots were there are less gankers if you want.
---
The pvp quest you complete when you or some1 in your party cap a tower and gives as much honor as an wsg win.
---
Controling the 3 towers gives a buff for everyone in the zone that could increas the rep gain and a buff that increas the dmg delt to enemy players
---
I think you have to strike a balance between healing and survivability.  In PvP you're not healing a fully buffed raid tank for minutes on end, so you can get away with less plus healing. And a dead paladin does no healing at all. 
---
My practical experience though was as a 29 holy pally twink in BC. I made sure to wear mostly Stam/int mail and was unstoppable. My alliance competition however all dressed like priests and got continually stomped by our hunters. Granted, this may not 100 percent be applicable bc the 29 bracket is HEAVY on physical damage due to the preponderance of hunters and rogues.
---
You might be surprised that it is not the number of people playing classic or modern that will matter but rather the customer base willing to spend money on micro transactions that would stay in modern.
---
What I point to as an example are free to play games. It's the 1%who spend THOUSANDS in the games that make them profitable, not the hundreds who play. 
---
Thus, even if classic has more players, as long as the micro-transaction consumers still live in modern they will make modern more profitable for the money overlords
---
This is what I did.  Logged on maybe 15min or so before raid and farmed some shards from mobs around the raid entrance.
---
I played up through Cata. My favorite capped lvl character was my troll hunter. Love hunters the most im general, so fun. Rolling orc hunter this time though.
---
This isn’t Ironforge.
---
I’m sure there are guides somewhere. I had friends that all played rogues so I don’t have them heh. Paladin since 05 heh.
---
You should only bubble if you cannot finish a heal before the tanks dies.
---
Bubble is 'oh shit' button that gives you enough time to get out a big heal.
---
Looks weird. I dont see the bluffs and bridges.
---
Happens on r/wow too, at least on the mobile app. I just don't think the comment icon actually does anything when you're on the picture.
---
If you do that, I would start skinning herbing. The early herbs are very worthless, so it's a real pain to catch up later (as you are running around a zone pickcing herbs that don't matter). But they do vendor for more than nothing (20-30 copper usually for a peacebloom node). 
---
Also, it's very easy to get 100 herb skill, because as you get to higher level zones, no one picks the worthless 1 skill starting herbs. Really, herbing is tough to keep on level to pick the valuable stuff, but it's very easy to find some nodes, wherever you go, to level your herb skill
---
really, It's quite expensive to level leatherworking to craft your own armor, and I would be tempted to just buy stuff off the auction house if you don't intend to keep the profession at 60.
---
Sure they would, they could believe a big rate (sales/day) would be more impressive than just a big raw number. Plus there may be a belief that prepurchasers may not necessarily play on launch day. Also the 24 hour number doesn’t make sense if it includes pre purchases lmao
---
So you think Blizzard is so swamped with bugs they can't even do further testing?
---
Please.
---
You mean the city that has always looked like a ramshackle hovel in the shanties of a scorched desert where life is awful?
---
Cool painting though.
---
Man duskwood scared the shit out of 10yo me
---
The mentality of someone who is willing to destroy a buisness because they are unwilling to accept change. The world doesn't revolve around you and a buisness doesn't stay afloat. You'd think the fact that a game that was released back in 2004 is still running today with millions of followers is a proven merit of success. But fuck logic.
---
Under what illusion do you think engineering is a must on PvP? It can be a help must a must? Absolutely not.
---
Powdered pain and essence of suffering*
---
Shaman / Warrior is better imo, Windfury is irreplaceable
---
???? 
---
Paladins are phenomenal pve healers and warriors are probably the best pve DPS...
---
There's a bunch of items and even talents that reduce the targets magical resistance in vanilla.
---
Maybe he just demand a duel and instead of swords or pistols, a boxing match will be the order of the day
---
Torn between Tauren Shaman and an UD Mage. Going horde PvP server, looking to do medium-core raiding with fun PvP on side. Mostly Battleground with guild mates, not expecting to rank up high in PvP but I enjoy being viable. 
---
I want to be in demand in raids, get some tier 1/2, and have fun during raids. I enjoy dungeon runs a lot too.
---
Worried that shamans are hard to level and that heir UIs have 3x as many buttons as others. 
---
Worries that mages are too hard to get gear bc they fight with other clothiers and high amount of mages. 
---
Shaman or mage! Idk!
---
Everyone can roll need on the BoE.
---
From the moment you decide to use elves, orcs and dwarves in your fantasy world you're already firmly in hack territory. The Horde had a feel and theme to it in Vanilla which the blood elves didn't fit *at all.* But Blizzard wanted to try to balance the faction populations so they simply forced in a "pretty" race for the children to play with. It didn't necessarily ruin things overnight, but the character of the Horde was never the same afterward.
---
Laughing
---
Stormwind is the greatest city in Warcraft by a long shot.
---
Fucking classic.
---
Hard disagree, personally. Survivability of pocket pally healers makes them unrivaled, which is why Alliance has such an edge in WSG.
---
The complexities of all classes only appear in PvP environments.  You will be well on your way to an acceptable quality of play after leveling a warlock with PvE in mind.
---
I knew I didn't make it up, I was looking for a solid hour for a night elf town in that area, I thought it was called Gendris or something but couldn't find anything
---
yeah defo rename Ar'lanil to Nendis
---
That's not at all what I said. Not everything is an extreme.
---
eat alliance corpses for extra disrespect
---
After playing original vanilla and pservers for years I can sum up the best newbie tips in the following way:
---
1. If you want to do raids and roll and decide to roll a class capable of healing - you will be healing in raids. 
---
2. There are 3 somewhat important racial choices: dwarf priest and orc/human warrior. This does not mean that you're fucking up by not picking these, but it is very likely to make your life harder. 
---
3. It is not 2005 and we know exactly what we are getting and have a tremendous amount of accumulated knowledge, there are guides for literally everything you might need. Everyone was a noob once, but now you can fix it very quickly. Not knowing something is completely normal, but refusing to learn is bad.
---
4. You have a freedom of choice to play the way you want, but if you want to play with other players then you have to stick to their rules.
---
I wonder if they had brought out classic sooner, if Robin Williams would still be with us.
---
And Mila Kunis she spoke about being super addicted on one of the late night shows a long time ago.
---
His commercial is what made me buy the game ngl
---
Define "worth"
---
Can you cast shadow bolt? If yes: then wlock is not too complicated.
---
More seriously: you'll also need to keep your allotted debuff up. But then it's shadow bolt.
---
If it has use for me, I need. That includes a guildie who can use the pattern to make the item for me.
---
If nobody needs and its gonna sit there and rot, then it's a greed roll to see who vendors it. That's the only time you greed, if it's being deleted at the vendor for gold. Selling it to another player is not deleting the item for gold the way vendoring an item is.
---
PW:S is both inneficient for mana and stops them from getting rage/threat.  For dungeons its best use is to throw onto DPS who agro, to ensure they survive 2-3 hits before you get a real heal off.  Or I guess you could use it predicative before big damage on tank while you immediately start casting greater heal.  
---
It is useful in raids, but you should not need more than 1-2 priests as discipline.  
---
Unfortunately Disc isnt really that great, maybe it has its place in PVP I dont know.  Priest healing is fun in classic without relying on shield anyways.  I played on a couple Pservers as priest and I had about 8-10 heals of various downrank and I knew from memory exactly how much each one would heal and which ones were the most mana efficient.  Healing is the most fun in classic
---
I dont play a warlock but my friend has since day one. I dont remember him having issues in vanilla but during tbc he was a farming machine as aff. We would have 5+ guys on him and would never go below 90% while farming.
---
No, I just said. Greed for sell, need for need. **Super** simple.
---
Then why are all the world firsts and speed records taken by Horde?
---
Besides, Horde can get Paladin blessings. Alliance can never get totems.
---
Stv is the reason I love pvp servers.  World pvp makes the game much more dynamic and fun.
---
&gt;If it has use for me, I need. 
---
If that use is money, it's greed. Entirely simple concept that you can't grasp.
---
&gt; Def stance, shield block, demo shout, thunderclap, shield bash just to name a few. LGG. 
---
Which means, you don't do any damage, while all of that barely does anything to mitigate the rets holy dmg. Where is the advantage here? You stand around barely doing any damage and don't mitigate all that much. So, you just put yourself in a losing position.
---
&gt; Death ray gets crit from recklessness so its way better on a warrior. 
---
Way better, because you have a 30min cd, which boosts it? And death ray can backfire.
---
Pretty sure they have one of the most basic rotations out there for standard raid specs.
---
I wish I was in your shoes... To be able to play classic wow for the first time. To discover a whole new world full of stories to learn, monsters to kill, skills to learn and master. I am really jealous that you get to experience all of that for the first time in 2019 on a decent computer and not at 5fps like me when I started. Maybe it will be different because not all the community is there with you in terms know game knowledge but I think you will have a great time because you werent supposed to go into the game knowing everything at all.
---
Worse than that the layering is/was hyper super aggressive for testing purposes. We're talking &lt;5 players per layer.
---
Nah, give me a resto shaman who can place totems well, and earth shock your pally heals leaving your holy spells utterly useless, since you ONLY have holy spells. Oh you want to stun the shaman? Nope say hi to grounding totem. Oh you BoP’d someone? Purge. Hand of freedom? Purge. Need I say more?
---
Except he has the entire rest of the week to help his guild and grind rep/consumables/alternative gear.
---
"WoW will release August 27th 2019 Jump aboard the hype train"
---
Nice touch. ;-)
---
Multiboxing BGs was never really that great anyway. There's a limited amount of people on each team, so having each character be more controled is better. Still I like to see it go.
---
It works well enough in open world PvP, and will be fairly good for Phase 2.
---
Do spiders have a grounding web in vanilla?
---
What? Everything that can be tested at the level cap of 40 probably has been extensively. Some people played a SHIT TON.
---
It's capped at 40... how much could you possibly do at 40 after you've done everything you can do at 40? People did a ton of things, there's no end game at 40...
---
No paladins, more WOTF and grounding totem. Rogue is already a bad match-up for you even when they aren't undead. Conventional advice is: PvP go horde, PvE go alliance.
---
It sounds like a good fit for you. It’s a fun and rewarding class with imo the best class quests in the game and you’ll have a blast trying to get them done. 
---
You don’t need great reflexes to do well with the class and you can recover pretty well when ganked. Especially once you have death coil which buys you time to get the fear juggle going. Succubus can cover for slow reflexes too.
---
OP is correct.
---
Yes, they're just two player custom maps. You can look it up on Hive Workshop if you're interested.
---
I think they had some drama and are under 1000 now. Alpha beta fish is only ~60 people smaller now without any streamers.
---
Except they didn't "go to work".
---
They couldn't go back into stealth with dots on them, and kick/gouge/kidney shot all consumed energy/combo points.  So while they could interrupt you doing your thing they also mitigated their own dps to do so.  On top of the Priest already having shadow form, inner fire, and power word: shield mitigating their damage.
---
WotF also didn't do a thing about blackout procs.  Plus, the entire time the priest was healing with vampiric embrace.
---
Also, if the rogue DID drag the fight out it let the priest get their physic scream back up or have the debuff from pw:s fall off to be used again.  Also, once they did pop WotF the priest could use an opening to mind control (an opening not try to cast it in combat) the rogue to generate distance/waste resources/let his dots tick.
---
Also, if you're a horde side priest you don't even have to deal with WotF, so again you don't need racials to beat a rogue as a shadow priest.
---
The pally would just bubble and continue to heal while everyone else gangbangs your warrior.
---
It might be a cool idea that the servers could be named or named after the dev team that brought us this amazing blast from the past
---
me..
---
HAAATE IT OMGZ NO CHANGES!! DO YOU WANT RETAIL! MERGHHHH 
---
Jokes nice work 😃
---
^ brave
---
That is actually beautiful
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Lok'tar Ogar
---
And I can speak for us orcs that we love Aubrey Plaza
---
And how much quicker do we kill those mobs, again...?
---
I'll try to keep this as concise as possible:
---
Your spells have a chance to miss, determined by the level difference between you and your target. This is called the spell hit penalty. The spell hit penalty is different in PvP than it is in PvE.
---
Here is a table which shows how spell hit chance is determined by levels:
---
Level difference|PvE|PvP
---
:--|:--|:--
---
-4|100%|100%
---
-3|99%|99%|
---
-2|98%|98%|
---
-1|97%|97%|
---
0|96%|96%|
---
+1|95%|95%|
---
+2|94%|94%|
---
+3|83%|87%|
---
+4|72%|80%|
---
+5|61%|73%|
---
Bosses have a unique level classification from all other mob types. They are always considered to be three levels higher than the player. When you mouse over them the tooltip shows that they are classified as a boss with the level "??".
---
As you can see, there is a 17% chance for spells to miss vs. bosses, with one important stipulation: there is a hard coded 1% chance for spells to miss vs. any target regardless of the player's total spell hit chance. Because of this, players often refer to the 'soft hit cap' to denote the fact that it is impossible to reach 100% spell hit chance vs targets that are 3 levels below or above themselves. There is also a term called 'hard hit cap' which simply means actually reaching or surpassing the 17% hit threshold from gear and talents. There is no use in obtaining that much spell hit however since there is always a 1% chance for spells to miss.
---
And finally you need to know that classic tries to obfuscate how spell resists and spell misses work. When a spell misses the damage text and the combat log shows a missed spell as a full resist, which is the exact same behavior that you see when a spell is *actually* resisted. I.e, its damage is completely negated by the targets magical resistance to that school.
---
What does it all mean? You need a combined total of 16% spell hit chance from gear and talents vs. bosses.
---
I guess the question is, why do cloth items with massive stats exist and mail/plate items with massive stats don't exist.
---
Sorry but at some point people just lack the base knowledge needed to have a meaningful discussion about a topic.
---
I would essentially either need to A) Redo the entire list myself, or B) Write an entire pallytanking guide to explain where he went wrong.
---
I have neither the time nor inclination to do either of those things, but I do have the time and inclination to let potential pallytanks know that this list isn't good.
---
I seem to recall more concrete and dwarven statues
---
Beta is like 3,000 people per fac. That's nothing compared to classic. They could double that plus raise the cap, and it wouldn't touch their sub numbers.
---
33 here, full time career as a Geologist, wife (no kids yet though, that would be a game changer).  I
---
heheheh, wait till you see all the "flask reserved" groups.
---
I'd drop 1 point in bonus stealth and 1 from bonus ferocious bite for 2 pts in bonus swipe, maul, rake etc damage.
---
That’s funny. I logged into 8.2 last night for the first time. Completed the openers and by the third daily I felt obligated to log off. Eff that noise.
---
Logging on, not because you want to do something, but to just hang out and chat with people.
---
Super easy. PVP is a different story
---
No, the only time its greed is if the item is going to be effectively deleted and wasted. You roll over who gets that gold, because otherwise you're letting gold not get looted.
---
Guess that depends highly on the person and the guild.
---
Logging in to raid was awesome every single time, and I looked forward to it from MC to Naxx. It meant I got to work towards some amazing gear, new bosses and hang out with my friends.
---
His name was Pat, he made [this pvp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok) where he was able to have both Mortal Strike and Deathwish.
---
Pretty gnarly lol
---
Haven't had much luck getting a group ahead of time in MMOs. Some kind of incompatibility always comes up. I think I'll just play the game and find new friends organically.
---
Agreed, I much more enjoyed making my own chores as opposed to doing the chores assigned to me.  I did like the isle at the time, but I didn't know that it was going to turn into the monster it is now.  
---
All there is to do is never ending assignments that give way better rewards than they should, and it fucks up the incentive to push your limits.  
---
I ain't never really got hardcore into mythic raiding, but I'm a solid heroic raider.  I show up, I top meters, I fill if I have to, I know all the fights, and I do what I can to make sure everybody is having a good time.  There is currently no fucking reason to do any of that because there is nothing to be gained.  My best item by a mile is from matching shapes and drawing a square.
---
It's kind of funny when you compare it to the Ironforge art given the disparity of Alliance cities vs Horde cities in classic.
---
Nobody can even level past 40 in beta.
---
You're closer to every raid until AQ or Naxx. Its definitely something you'll notice.
---
Honestly, if you’re overwhelmed by class ability suites in world of Warcraft being too complex, Maybe try an easier game...
---
That said, in raids warlock press curse once per mob every 5 min, and press shadowbolt otherwise, when they need mana, they tap. That’s it, the whole thing. 
---
In 5 man’s, you have a bit more freedom to spit out some dots, use cc and your pets. If the tank is weak, your pets can help soak damage. 
---
In PvP you will have to use the majority of your toolkit. But even still that’s mostly cc, dots and defensives/utility spells.
---
OP must not plan on raiding, or is playing on an RP server.
---
Do the gnomeragan quest. The pants you get will last you till level 50 or so.
---
While others try to convince the party that we do more damage than the tank...
---
This guys a douche
---
The full set isn't BIS for mages, only the vest is.
---
Your paladin will be consumed with protecting himself in that moment, sure you bubble, you got about what, 8-10seconds of safety? Now you’re back to square one with no CDs to fall back on. Mean while my warrior is owning your warrior because of WF totem. Oh you had Blessing of might on your warrior, doesn’t matter, it’s purged. Your bubble dropped and you’re still casting heals? Earthshock again. Earthbind totem and frost shock on you or your warrior. Hand of freedom lasts for no time due to Purge.
---
Watch your tone with me, boy. You may be the minmaxer, but I’m still your superior as a Roleplayer.
---
Sweet!  Now I just have to decide between Gnome and Human since I'm going to play Alliance.  Actually, I always play Ally because I know the areas well as it's what I learned on.  To be honest, neither Human nor Gnome fits my class fantasy of a Warlock.  It'd have to be Undead, maybe Orc, but definitely Undead.
---
Raid scene is spam shadow bolt.
---
Your hotter ex....you think you do but she doesnt
---
If you take over a minute to kill a certain enemy it can be worth it, otherwise don't bother.
---
You'll be fine. As long as you are able to learn how things work as you go along. Raids will be easy as long as your raid leader knows what he is doing
---
Watched to the end. Nice video, GZ
---
For me it was all stuff I wanted to do. Farming for mats for whatever was fun, because I was working towards an even greater goal.
---
I enjoyed relaxing during mining runs because it meant I was getting closer to an epic mount.
---
Everything you do matters and none of it is wasted time. Re-frame your perspective for an even more enjoyable experience.
---
Yeah, from what I'm reading, I just see a lot of "There's a lot to keep track of, and you'll probably need addons just to do so".  Those type of sentiments are what sort of shook my balance.
---
Should not be too much of a money sink, not like you have to learn every pattern from the trainer while lvling, i plan on going tailor on my mage basicly just for bags.. I love big bags
---
Yeah, you don't need much for MC but don't expect to top the meters.
---
If it's a fresh server and everyone are fresh 60s in quest greens and blues and it's an obvious upgrade to someone then they should get priority on it IMO.
---
So long as they equip it right away.
---
If you disagree with that specific scenario then you're just a greedy &amp;@#$.
---
Need before Greed has been the motto since Vanilla launch.
---
Now if were several months into a servers launch then yes, BoEs just get treated as a pile of gold for the AH.
---
Dalaran was originally a human city state, the ruling class was the humans magi who learned from the quel dorei to wield magic to fight the Amani trolls. 
---
There might be some orcs in the Kirin tor now idk. Seems weird when orcs are shamanistic/fel magic users, though.
---
Yea she wasn’t just addicted. She had to not talk in ventrilo because people would recognize her voice. She dropped all the gaming lingo and then realized no one knew what she was talking about, except gamers.
---
Best face-swap ever!
---
This was never the norm in PUGs.
---
Rare BoE = everyone rolls Need so nobody like OP can ninja it.
---
Yet you’ll have to take into account the vast casual audience as well.
---
I know.
---
Which doesn't change the fact that servers are dead.
---
People really over estimate paladins.  Their heals are hot garbage.  It can’t keep up with burst in PvP.  Smart players just ignore the paladin, cc him when they can, Or just throw a CS on them and watch them auto attack for 10 seconds
---
Sigh.
---
It is odd how many so called experts are talking about this game and nobody knows what wrath gear is.
---
It is green drop gear that can be as low as level 6 or so.
---
King's honor, friend.
---
Old School RuneScape has kept microtransactions out of the game for about 6 years now. Technically, they've had one microtransaction in since the beginning. They have an equivalent to the WoW token and they still sell those, but partly as a way to disincentivize bot-driven gold farms in addition to being a moneymaking technique.
---
I wouldn't be horribly offended if WoW tokens were implemented into Classic, but I definitely wouldn't prefer it.
---
7fps in raids if you were lucky / rich with a nice rig.
---
Yup.
---
They're essentially only doing progressive item addition for recipes and 1.10 dungeon items from what I've seen- we'll have to see though
---
I missed a lot of content in vanilla thanks to working third shift.  Most guilds ran west coast time and late enough I couldn't do much raiding.  There were also a number of classes I didn't play much of.
---
Depends what you mean by good enough. I installed the beta on my 2013 Retina MBP and it ran okay at medium settings. I wouldn't ever want to raid with it though.
---
This. Holy paladin is a Better option for you in a duo. 
---
If you do go Priest yeah bubble is an emergency heal. It’s meant for “oh shit don’t die while I cast this big heal to get you back up!” It is not mana efficient at all. It’s an oh shit button.
---
hotter and have more depth
---
For BOEs everyone rolls need, generally speaking.
---
While I would say that green BOEs should be standard need/greed, the value (functional &amp; gold) of blues and purples can be game changing during the leveling process. Everyone should roll need to keep it fair and to prevent ninjas.
---
Always need on boes. If he needed on it he wouldnt be losing out. His fault.
---
Who is this four chan?
---
&gt; the only time its greed is if the item is going to be effectively deleted and wasted.
---
Most items are eventually deleted, where do you draw the line?
---
You still have BoP, BoF, LoH, and a ton of other goodies to fall back on.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a02wem/horde_pvp_alliance_pve/
---
I'm not the only one who says alliance dominate organized PvP.
---
What's wrong with the wow token though? It doesn't hurt the economy, and doesn't negatively impact gameplay any more than the existence of gold sellers otherwise would. Given how big it is for Blizzard and the lack of any downside, I feel like the wow token is an inevitability once classic becomes stable/stagnant. Would you uninstall if that was the only thing they added, and why? I am indifferent on the matter, just don't see how you can lump in the wow token with other more gameplay-influencing monetization like cash shop cosmetics.
---
&gt;Honestly, if you’re overwhelmed by class ability suites in world of Warcraft being too complex, Maybe try an easier game...
---
Honestly, since I've played Neverwinter, ESO, Guild Wars 2 and FFXIV, I've got to tell you that in my opinion, all of those games are crap compared to WoW - at least the Vanilla\~ version.  Legion and all that stuff?  Trash to me.  It sounds like maybe this class is easier to play in PvE than I thought.  I'm happy to have heard that.  Easy enough.  If I decide I want to PvP and I can't figure out how to use the Warlock, I'll just roll a PvP character from a different class.
---
Mina Kunis
---
Undercity &gt; Orgrimmar &gt; Thunder Bluff
---
It changes the relevancy of that factoid though.
---
There should never be any sort of microtransactions in the game. The most they would ever do would be pets or something, but it wouldn't be worth even doing that. Similar to OSRS, they know that players would quit the game if they tried to turn it into BFA.
---
Those items were used and need rolled on
---
Very encouraging - thank you!
---
I sold those bombs you get for free in Halaa (the PVP town in nagrand) on the AH.
---
It says it does a lot of damage, but don't specify it only works on the flying mounts that fly around Halaa.
---
Made a little gold, but decided that it would have been a dick move to continue selling them.
---
Where are you getting two weeks? They said it will be phase 1 only. I expect phase 1 to last 3+ months, so some layering could last that long, worst case. Blizz is trying to guess how many people will be tourists who go away. You don't want them capping servers at 6k if that only leaves 1.5k on every single server 3-4 months on. Server merges are 100 times worse than layering. Layering let's them keep each server at 3-4k pop layers for as long as they need to be layered for. One server might just need it for 2 weeks if it's very tourist filled. Another might need it for 3 months if it stayed high pop.
---
It's amazing how completely thick some of you people are on this sub.
---
Classic is dead, because the capped beta (of a game releasing in less than 2 months) is dead, clearly. That reasoning is devoid of any logic or thought.
---
Floating peacebloom!!1
---
Well your first problem is using an Apple product.
---
As a future druid. I love this! Thank you so much
---
Hunter is the most fun class imo, especially in pvp
---
 I'd own pretty much everyone
---
I mentioned 2 out of 3 that you bring up, **PURGED**. Lay on hands is what you bring up? Okay nice long ass cool down you get once a BG. If even that.  
---
I’m not saying Paladins aren’t good, shamans are just better.
---
The funny thing is that Vanilla always had an LFD system.
---
The Meeting Stone system matched 5 people together who were looking to do a dungeon, circumventing the LFM spam entirely. Problem is that it didn't make sure that the group had two people who wanted to act as a tank and healer, so it often matched 5 DPS together, and nobody used it because of that.
---
Adding dialogue to the Meeting Stone like "I want to protect my allies," "I want to heal my allies," and "I want to help slay our enemies" to essentially queue up as a specific role would make it into an actually good LFD system.
---
You are doing a bit more than giving an opinion. You are stating with a high degree of certainty that things that have been done in beta were impossible in vanilla pre-1.12 , based on your immeasurable prowess as a gamer and age at the time. 
---
There are ways to frame an opinion that leave plenty of room for you being full of shit.
---
That would definitely work too.
---
I'm going to get my epic mount. I only got it during TBC. I was quite a bad player back then and was always poor.
---
This is the saddest part about raiding, except for interesting raid boss mechanics the gameplay becomes so much more simple.  It would have been great if they could make more challenging 5 mans instead where you have to think a little more instead of just spam a boss for a few minutes and hope your gear is good enough to take them down.
---
I've raided as a hunter and as MT. Overall I got tired of everyone blaming me for wipes so I moved to my hunter.
---
I know, I'm saying not many people would agree with that.
---
I understand the logic, but from that same logic, any random can then come around and attack you. Like I said, I hope you guys get your realm, just makes more sense to flag as needed, in my head. But you guys know better what you want/need, so you do you.
---
Yeah I think it was a big whiff that we couldn't access any of the locations visible from the tram.
---
Seriously Warlock is 90% casting Shadowbolt in raid.
---
It's literally one of the easiest PvE classes for DPS.
---
I never saw it as an absolute, in some cases we all rolled greed, in others we all rolled need. Usually it depended on what the first person did. If the first 3 people roll greed on a BoE then it was only polite to follow and greed as well unless you intended on using it. There was never a hard "every always rolls need/greed" on any server I played. Generally it was discussed in the group when something dropped or at the start of the run. Without cross realm groping it becomes a lot harder to find decent groups once you get labelled a ninja looter.
---
The beta was dying before 8.2 dropped. There isn't much to do at level 40.
---
What's funny is this was posted in my guilds discord. A large number of people in my guild think a lot of it is true(if not all of it).  With no evidence either way, they take this as newest info with nothing refuting it, which makes it believable.
---
ive gotten various wrath gear green drops on beta
---
Right then, so you agree that items that are rolled need on should be used and not sold.
---
Then they’ve not played with a top tier shaman, obviously.
---
You'll only want to use PW:S when you really need the breathing room for a heal, regardless of whether the tank uses rage or not.
---
Great painting, well done
---
Show me one that wants to play on his phone.
---
Vanilla macros were fairly primitive. I don't know if this is possible.
---
Faster paced than PUBG but I'm pretty sure Apex is even faster than Fortnite. People who shit on Fortnite are dumb still. Literally just hating it because it's cool to hate it. Reminds me of 5 years ago when everyone was hating on Justin Bieber on reddit for no apparent reason.
---
Fortnite has a huge skillcap with the building mechanic, too. Miles higher than vanilla wow's.
---
Proven how? When? By what metric?
---
*You* may not think they go well together. Open, unrestricted PvP may be detrimental to *your* RP experience. And that's perfectly fine. That's why we have normal RP servers.
---
Not only do you not speak for the rest of us, however; if the survey in the sidebar is anything to go by you are *distinctly* in the minority on this issue.
---
&gt; if you want to PvP on RP realm then there is always flagging.
---
That's like telling someone who wants to climb Everest, "Hey, there's always the climbing wall at the gym."
---
They may be similar activities conceptually but it's not even close to the same thing.
---
All of that is irrelevant.  Wtf does liking dogs or military have to do with the fact that you are pro-censorship?  That is exactly the kind of person I would assume would be pro-censorship.  Mr. fucking upright good-guy knows what's best for you.  "Let me give you the list  of Party Approved jokes to tell."  Pfft. Fuck off.
---
Your damage rotation in raids:
---
111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
---
i thought i recognized it, here's what i supposed is the original, i have it in my folder since at least 2011
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lqcMMmT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lqcMMmT.jpg)
---
Yeah man. Thats the next thing.
---
Exactly blood elfs would team up with savages and especially undeads(?!)
---
Its like troggs teaming up with dwarfs to hunt down gnomes
---
Pretty much all the production professions are gold sinks. It's just that gold, technically, is unlimited.
---
Do you want to spend the time to skill it up while leveling or wait until later? If you're in a hurry to level 60 then I'd just wait and bank the mats as you go.
---
Or they've watched that top tier shaman get rolled by the top alliance PvP groups.
---
Good luck it's a very rewarding quest chain. That said it was way too easy to get grieved during it.
---
3,000 people is what, about one server in Vanilla? They clearly don't need anymore testers. I'm not sure why there are so many brain-dead people saying Classic is a dead game based on a very limited and capped beta.
---
People are people though, right? Gotta complain about something.
---
*Whoosh...*
---
I'm not sure what I did to rile you up...but I'm pretty sure you missed the part where I said its "almost" like the did it that way...thus missing the whole point of the statement.  
---
But I appreciate that you think I'm "fucking delusional" over a minor quip...stay classy /u/Buttplug4potus lol  ;)
---
Lord Admiral's favor, friend!
---
You are the winner of the internet. 
---
He killed himself because of his illness Lewy Body Syndrome.  It's a terrible illness and he was going to suffer greatly if he didn't opt out.
---
Not because of depression which people falsely attribute his suicide to.
---
So no Classic wouldn't cure Lewis Body Syndrome.
---
What is more profitable, jump runs with a tank or solo grinding in DM as a priest?
---
I would argue that you will enjoy the game more so than anyone else. 
---
Being brand new to the WoW universe can only happen once. IMO, Classic is the best experience for this. Because the leveling is so much slower, you learn as you go and the world is contained to just the 2 continents. You don’t have to worry about getting dropped in new expansion zones every 10 levels and trying to figure out what is what.
---
The community is overwhelmingly gracious to anyone that needs help also. This is such a key difference in Classic versus retail that it cannot be overstated or said enough. It’s not like Xbox live. I personally haven’t played much from WOD through BFA, but my last sub to level my main for 2 months, I literally spoke only 4 sentences to other players. And I never spoke to anyone more than once because I never saw them again. There’s just no need to.
---
Classic keeps everyone and everything in the same vicinity. Actions have consequences, both good and bad. Everyone has and will wipe during a dungeon or raid. Just laugh and learn man, it’s a game. You’ll get it easy. The mechanics aren’t particularly hard. 
---
Just take the beginning of beta for instance. You have members from the guild known for world firsts dying to boars..hahahaha. And they loved it.  And it changed their entire outlook on Classic once they started playing. 
---
I personally envy you. I can vaguely remember the very first time I logged into and created my character, who is still my main 13ish years later. Walking up to and killing that first level 1 zombie was awesome. Getting my first level was amazing. You’re going to be addicted..haha. Have food and drink at the ready..lol.
---
Best wishes on your WoW experience buddy! I hope to catch you in game!
---
Assuming there are 8 warlocks in the raid, 7 won't use corruption, and 5-6 won't use any curses. So most will only be using shadowbolt.
---
When has raiding itself ever not been like this? If you’ve kept on the progression train for the last 15 years, every new raid has new bosses, gear and time to hang out with ur buds. 
---
The only thing that’s changed is the content is harder today, and you need to spend WAY less time out of raids to be qualified in the raid. 
---
I’m not talking about heroic normal, lfr raiders. The only real raiders in Vanilla were 40 man raid teams, 10 man UBRS doesn’t make you a raid guild, neither does heroic whoever-the-fuck.
---
I’ve never hated raids, but I’ve certainly gotten burnt out from the hours of prep on top of my 20+ hour raid week.
---
Ethical surprise mechanics, that sounds like a good guild name lol
---
Don't get caught up worrying about the hardcore players. Play the game at your own pace and it'll be fine.
---
Or you're compelled by a terrible addiction
---
And that's exactly what Blizzard has intended. Level to 40, test the content to that point, be done with the beta.
---
That's all they needed or it would have opened to more people and the cap would be raised.
---
Who gives a shit if BETA is dying? It's inevitable.
---
Have you ever actually seen 8 warlocks in a 40 man raid before?
---
Le sigh, you haven’t actually look at anything I’ve typed because your rebuttals are terrible. Every single ability your paladin has, can be countered by a shaman. This is the point. Not what a group of 10 can do. A shaman warrior vs a paladin warrior.
---
Why is it not realistic? It hurts no one but the shareholders.
---
We get a better game, the developers don’t have to work like slaves. Win win? (If delay is actually what’s needed in the end)
---
C'mon....  There's a ton more that goes into it.  For example, Soul Stones(which I'm just learning about).  They've got to be used/distributed/whatever at the right time.  There's curses to keep up, I mean, it's hard for me to expand on it since I know so little, but from watching videos and such, it's definitely more than pressing 1.  Even Mages, who are notoriously simple to play, have more to do than spam Frostbolt.  Like I mentioned, if you want to be a good player, you're going to have to have good situational awareness and make decent choices.
---
Yeah. If I need a BoE and give it to my alt, that is using it.
---
If I give a BoE pattern for the bottomless bag to a guildie who can make the bag for me for free because I gave him the realm first pattern, that is of use to me too.
---
I would just take the mythic+ system of retail. That works perfectly fine.
---
&gt;  WOLVE (PvE attack boost)
---
Wolf buff is also insane for PVP
---
Hey, same here! 
---
The last Classic stress test was my first time playing WoW. But I’ve played a bit of Warcraft 3 before. 
---
Now I’m trying to play through all of the campaigns, then move onto Frozen Throne and finish it before Classic’s launch. 
---
I love it so far!
---
My 1.13 content erection has lasted longer than four hours D:
---
Back in original classic i always wanted to play dwarves, but their model on the left side when they swing like cuts into a straight line. Hard to describe. It drove me crazy on every dwarf alt.
---
Now do all the coasts, thx.
---
every piece of loot matters to somebody. if it's a big item, have a conversation **before** it drops with the people that are in contention for it so drama is avoided
---
Was this shit really worth reposting?
---
that's completely normal
---
What guild gives Thunderfury to a hunter? Asking for a friend.
---
It won't be the 8 at launch that we are used to so there might even be room for you to use corruption and curse of elements.
---
During boss fights I had to zoom on the floor to have a reasonable fps lol. 
---
Had a friend who always asked to bring stuff from Orgrimmar to him because his computer couldn't handle the city and crashed every time he entered. 
---
Good old pentium times.
---
Because of the OP's point. You log into Classic because you want to, not because you have to.
---
I wanted to log in to raid and farm stuff. I felt like I HAD to log in to raid through WoD, Legion, BfA. Even if there were new bosses, new gear and I had friends to raid with. The raids themselves were pretty good for the most part, but the rest of the game completely lacked.
---
I played a Tauren Warrior for about 7,200 hours through WotLK.
---
Given warriors' slow leveling and gear dependency at 60, I don't quite think I'll have enough time to play one effectively. I anticipate having maybe 10-20 hours to play per week, with limited ability to raid on weekdays.
---
For this reason I'm contemplating playing an undead warlock because they have decent survivability, are good at leveling, are useful in lower-end raids like MC (banish adds), have a lot of utility and a high skill cap in PvP.
---
I guess farming soul shards and being a portal/healthstone factory is a downside, but imo any responsible warlock will maintain a full bag of shards.
---
Can anyone with significant Classic Warlock experience chyme in?
---
Ahhh the impenetrable fortress city of Orgrimmar
---
i pretty much have
---
She's a fantastic psychopath in Legion (the show not wow expansion).
---
I tried to say the same thing in a worst way a few months ago and was heavily downvoted. But I think it will happen eventually because I also think Classic will be very successful. If I had to guess, I'd say it will happen sometime after Naxx, whatever content that is. It will start with only TCG stuff and probably grow from there.
---
That’s what the horde calls a *city*?! It’s a dirt mound.
---
Yes you can. Dont let these people stop you because theyre wrong. The leveling spec for paladins IS holy shock build. You spec into ret until seal of command and 5% crit, then you start building into holy. Take the 5% strength over the intellect. Then you pick holy dmg down the tree until you get shock. Holy shock isnt needed for the leveling, but the build into holy shock is best for leveling.
---
I put points into furor to save time while soloing quests, and feral instinct was more for the stealth increase than the threat increase. Auto-root would be nice for escaping PvP ganks, but I wasn't sure that I could justify prioritizing it over other talents.
---
Dunno about the rest but items sure as hell are in your client language on beta. I'd inagine the rest is too.
---
As a shaman I would just say prepare to be a healer if you intend on raiding.
---
8 shamans in a raid is ideal so you'll be fine if you're resto
---
I strongly recommend 7/31/11 so that you have shadowburn and shorter shadowbolt/immolate.
---
As a warlock you will have to face tank a lot, so I can understand that you want to increase your survivle by drain-tanking. 
---
But overall the controlled(!) burst of shadowburn lets you win more consistantly than nightfall does. You can also cast it without the risk of getting interrupted.
---
And whenever you are not currently focussed the faster shadowbolts are not only more dps, but also have a higher range than drain life making it safer to cast.
---
I want to be able to aoe farm with my healing spec.   What would be the ideal spec and items to use?
---
&gt; Yeah. If I need a BoE and give it to my alt, that is using it.
---
Not by someone who was present.
---
&gt;If I give a BoE pattern for the bottomless bag to a guildie who can make the bag for me for free because I gave him the realm first pattern, that is of use to me too.
---
Of use, but not using to those who were present.
---
&gt;f I put it on the AH and someone buys it and equips it. That is them using it.
---
That's not why you put it on the AH though, if someone using it was your goal, AH would be irrelevant.
---
Bubble isn’t a thing like it is on live. It just doesnt work the same way. It costs much more mana, doesn’t have any secondary benefits (like atonement) and puts up the 15s weakened soul debuff.
---
Bubble isn’t a preventative thing in classic so much as a mini oh shit button. 
---
You toss bubble, then a flash heal and you can stabilize most situations from there.
---
Further, disc isn’t really an “absorb spec” in classic. It’s more like disc is the “mana efficiency” tree and holy is the “throughput” tree. 
---
Regardless of your spec, if you’re aren’t shadow, the vast majority of your pve healing will be cancel casting downranked 2.5s heals on the tank, tossing renews to deal with party damage and the odd flash heal in emergencies.
---
There wasn’t many dps warriors out there in Vanilla because majority of them had to have a tank set ready. Many fights needed more than just 2 tanks.
---
They already said in an interview with tipsout that they will use different names than vanilla / retail.
---
Original wow beta went to 40 aswell I understand
---
Can anyone tell me if I’m a jerk if I don’t use a single macro? I first started WoW around when burning crusade was out. Played for about a year or two on and off and had one of every class over lvl 30 and two up to 60. Don’t think I used a macro ever and I’m not sure it was a struggle.  Am I really oblivious to a better gaming experience on this one?
---
That's a great fun fact to pull out at a party!
---
Grab a warrior and farm together DM:E
---
HAHAHAHA YES. BFA BAD. HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
"I played Vanilla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I played a Horde Paladin" = 90% of people who claim they played Vanilla
---
Right. Beta servers are dead. Fine? They'll be non-existent pretty soon. It's 100% unimportant to the game when it launches.
---
Ex human city’s sewer system trumps Horde precarious settlements, now that shits FUNNY.
---
Sure, why not, better than much of the stuff here
---
Generally because they were threat capped I think.  Warriors could do the most dps, but they were limited by the tank's threat, so they couldn't reach their potential.
---
There were only 3 TCG cards in Vanilla. Riding turtle, tabard of flame, hippogryph hatchling. It wasnt until TBC that they really started coming out with some cool ones. Another question is if they will let Blizzcon items in the game like my Murloc Costume.
---
Unlikely the locks wore NR gear. It was usually just the rogues, warriors, and hunters.
---
The Drakestone comes with a random enchantment on top of the 7 Spell Damage. [Here's](https://db.rising-gods.de/?item=10796&amp;locale=0) a list of the possible enchantments. Obtaining a Drakestone of x Wrath, where x is the damage type you deal the most, will result in either 27 or 28 spell damage.
---
Right but each of these servers is multiple layers each as large as the old servers.
---
Exactly, that's one dual, not fighting two duels at once lol
---
In vanilla wow your rotation will change a LOT level to level. Some levels its best to just judge with righteousness.  Elite mobs, stronger mobs, in duels, etc the holy damage taken increase will help a lot. Basically the logic has to be "will the damage gained in the long run end the fight faster than just judging righteousness/command up front"
---
Why would boss parry chance have anything to do with Fury DPS?
---
Yea he did that old Street Sharks promo back in the day it was awesome
---
Is there one "master"-map with all your new zones and the old zones? Would love to look at your work as a whole :)
---
Goes without saying
---
Because warriors were massively changed very late into the game. 
---
Trust me warriors did dps in vanilla, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ACEQmdslA
---
Fair enough - tone of voice is hard to grasp on reddit. But still I’m curious when it isn’t about money. Keeping it on the topic of video games running past a scheduled delivery is never an issue that damages anything but profits.
---
They can always teleport to mooglade and hearth back to storm wind/west fall. I would say no. I usually go to west fall around 10 or 12 on my Druid if I don’t want to kick around darkshore.
---
See, this is the full truth.
---
Everything in classic will matter. Every thing you do will have a lasting impact, because it's unlikely future content or a new expansion will over write your efforts.
---
Preach 🙏
---
Attacks from the behind can't be parried, so those won't factor in. Threat may provide a slight hindrance to DPS warriors in classic however.
---
World buffs and consumables, optimized gear etc scale warriors a lot more than everybody else.
---
You will see casters also do a lot less DPS in original Vanilla because people didn't understand the importance of hit% as much as we do now. 
---
Lets face it, only the really high end guilds used world buffs and even them just for progression kills in Naxx and AQ, which makes a huge difference in DPS.
---
To the top with you

If this is reposted enough times a day we'll be on r/gaming levels of cool.

---
Just remember, Stormwind once belonged to the Horde.
---
We burned your capital.
---
Then we took your new capital as our own.
---
Then we burned your tree.
---
Only thing left is to tear down Ironforge.
---
It fixed a lot of problems with class design though.
---
Paladins were actually able to tank. Your AP gave spell power for ret. Similar things existed for other hybrid specs actually doing the role they intended to do.
---
Pets also scaled with your stats instead of requiring weird trinkets and set bonuses, and they could actually contribute because they didn't immediately die in some fights.
---
As a Paladin and Warlock player that was a lot of good stuff.
---
I don't like the flying mounts and I would have preferred there being more reason to stay in Azeroth etc.
---
In the early days at 60 a lot of gear that’s great for warriors and hunters is leather, lots that is good for Paladin, sham and Druid is cloth. 
---
There is a mail chest warriors wear till zg/aq. 
---
So yea in pve, all the time, it’s fine. 
---
In PvP, unless it has some gnarly bespoke stats, I’d consider higher armor classes with high stamina alottments.
---
Second quarter?
---
Even if rhey didnt plan on it, its just a white room, call some celebs and do it how long would it take? 1, 2 weeks?
---
That game is so fucking good
---
That little campaign is actually meant as a tie-in to World of Warcraft. Despite it being a downloadable extra, it showed the story to how Orgrimmar was founded.
---
&gt;Not by someone (character) who was present.
---
I am present. I am giving it to myself.
---
&gt;Of use, but not using to those who were present.
---
Yeah because they lost the roll
---
&gt;That's not why you put it on the AH though, if someone using it was your goal, AH would be irrelevant.
---
That's exactly what AH is for or else I would disenchant it or vendor it
---
You mean to the Burning Legion? What are you proud of exactly? That’s like taking steroids and bragging you won the race.
---
Those are very different play styles. Relative to mages, shaman is immobile, mana-hungry, and has no crowd control, and relative to shamans mages have no purge, healing, or windfury. I'd judge them purely by gameplay and throw all your gearing concerns out the window — it'll take a while but you'll get it in either case, either through raids or rank 10.
---
If you're picking for synergy I'd go shaman if your friends are melee and/or need heals, or go mage if you have heals already. Drinks and portals are great for any group to have.
---
Yeah, he said Diablo 4 was going to be first person and the first "fantasy shooter" with only 3 classes at launch.
---
Funny, but not very believable.
---
HAHAHA WE CLASSIC IMMERSION
---
From my experience, you will probably just want to go enh/ele for leveling. You'll do the most damage, and you can kill mobs with the warrior. You dont really need to sit back and heal, but you can save your mana for when it's necessary. Agility and spirit gear will give you the most uptime for Flurry, as well as great mana regen. You will want to save intellect gear as you go so that you can switch gear sets if you really do need to heal, but generally those instances will be specifically for healing dungeons. 
---
Ele resto is a good option, but no so much until after 40. You just wont have any good gear for it as shaman offensive spells are very mana intensive.
---
Everything. Threat. Fury has no threat dump. If bosses parry 9% more then it puts dps warriors at a higher disadvantage.
---
Ignore this post it's a troll no one can be this dumb
---
Well if it doesn't exist in a Google search, I'd have to guess it either doesn't exist or that's not what it's called. Maybe you're remembering the name wrong?
---
It's not worth 45g nothing is worth that except an epic now even Ogron's sash or Scorpashi pieces. The AH is basically completely dead, so most are quite broke.
---
Even trade mats are hardly selling
---
&gt; The game is 15 years old, no one has held 12 million for that kind of duration.
---
Literally irrelevant to what /u/kaazmodan stated. He stated that the subs were at 12 million for WotLK but tanked after Cata.  Your reasons you provided for the lower sub numbers doesn't, IMHO, adequately explain the *tanking* of sub numbers during and after Cata.
---
Why would you login into a Game you don't want to play?
---
Or C) they are playing the new patch it's not a requirement to like classic and hate retail.
---
Or D) it's a beta and most don't have their career centered around playing a character 8+ hours a day for a character that will go bye bye in less than 2 months.
---
Why not? Wow started as classic.
---
Monsters cannot parry from behind which is where you will be attacking from.  If you have 4 or 5 melee groups you have content on farm and are in half raid gear or more from the tier you are on.  How many times have you wiped at 1-2% because 1 person died.  Also just because humans do 1-2% more on average there are still plenty of times a dwarf / ne / gnome in equal gear will out dps them using the same timing due to RNG.  Weapon skill isn't effecting your yellow damage, only your auto attacks.  There are only 2 melee dps and that is rogue / warrior where human warriors deal 10% more damage then their counterparts due to rage generating from damage.  Race didn't matter in retail vanilla and naxx was cleared.  The only time I had race effect a raid on pservers was not having fear ward for ony when we had a replacement tank that wasn't very good.
---
Everyone in 2004 was new to the game. You’ll be fine people are helpful in classic.
---
Oh yeah that's right. Part of why I loved healing in classic was turning down all gfx and staring at my feet while raiding. My PC is a little better now.
---
Would just be [combat].  The opposite is [nocombat].
---
Why would they?
---
What a load of garbage. You're talking as if no one else here played Vanilla and raided.  That may be the case for you, maybe you were behind with the times or something but add-ons were a big deal in Vanilla for everyone I played with.  Rarely did someone I  know play with default UI and addons.
---
Nope, spiders just blows in vanillz
---
It does. But even analyzing Fury’s charts from their Naxx world first kills they didn’t even have a warrior in the top 9
---
Pretty simple in raids.  They can do a lot on instances with succubus and banish, which can make them a more complex class in 5 mans.  Plus you can fully use your dots for debuffs.
---
Didn't understand hit%? What shit fucking guilds were you in. Either that or you didn't play vanilla
---
being a noob in wow is like... 90% of the experience. you can't become good at something without being entirely bad at it to begin with.
---
The full value is the value the market assigns for it, BoPs have a set vendor price and is not subject to market pricing and therefore cannot capture the "full" value of an item, an upgrade will in almost any case be worth more than the vendor price.
---
For BoEs however the market decides the price, which means the price of a BoE will be the approximate value of equipping the BoE aka the value of the upgrade (or even more for Twink items) thus selling the item on AH for gold has the same value as equipping the item (since you can use that gold to buy the same BoE or another of equal value but usable to you).
---
YOU SAID CLASSIC!!!! ALL THE UPVOTES!!!
---
Bracers added in Phase 2
---
I'm not sure which logs you're looking at, but on \*most\* fights throughout later Vanilla our warriors were quite competitive:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxwt5Z0vSiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxwt5Z0vSiM)   
---
One reasonable explanation may be your raid was threat capped by your MT not putting out more TPS. This would give an edge for ranged/rogues to pull ahead, as warriors have no way of dodging threat outside of dying -&gt; BR.
---
Love it. Can I download it to use as wallpaper?
---
Without even clicking, I knew it was Org.
---
lol of course, minmaxers are just circlejerking, you can faceroll your way through the end game content if you have time and patience without any experience in classic. wow always have been a very simple game.
---
It has monetization, it's called subscribers.  If they were smart they would leave it at that.
---
So this is how Darnassus looks in the summer
---
Just get Nightfall and do it successfully.
---
From what I understand fury got a buff later in the game. It wasn't played much back in the day and now that people have min maxed so much on private servers it's known how well fury does.
---
To me the difference is that in Vanilla, you exist for the world. In retail, the world exists for you. I kind of grew tired of the whole "you're the only one that can wield Ashbringer" type stuff. Immersion breaking to me.
---
He really just wants an argument lol
---
While I think macros are super useful and almost necessary in some situations, especially with druids and "smart" shifting/unshifting I think you are using macros very wrong.   
---
Why would you ever put multiple spells with different cooldowns on the same keybind? For example your Q and E uses 3 different abilities each and all of them have a cooldown. You won't be able to see the cooldowns unless you hold down the modifier again which means you are constantly losing information (Bash and Feral Charge are two very important cooldowns to track separately).  
---
Macros need to be useful, to have a purpose. It's not a competition on how many abilities you can cram into 255 characters. Abilities with a cooldown absolutely deserves a separate keybind. If you make some smart macros you are going to have plenty of space on your actionbars and you don't need to lose out on information.
---
The interest compounds on the new amount every month (month 2 = 517.5g, month 3 = 535g... etc) Giving a grand total of   136,066.1507 gold owed after 164 months (14 years \* 12 months).   
---
This is also how people retire.
---
Fortnite improved Battle Royale snd made a much larger audience for it...
---
But the dozens of BR before Fortnite pioneered the genre.  Fortnite unapologetically took their favorite things from BR and added style and creativity outside of the more realistic BRs.
---
But fuck no it didn't pioneer the genre.  Do you even know what that means?
---
You log in in classic because you feel obligated to do dailies?
---
I think they’ve don’t at least a better job in later expansions with rotating world quests as dailies. It mixes things up, and also encouraged world pvp. I would go so far as to say if BFA word quests existed without mixed servers/instances/sharding/whatever it would be even more enjoyable as people wouldn’t avoid the world pvp by moving instances, etc. It would reinforce working with the other people in your community.

Pretty sure these are the ones. Didn’t have time to rewatch before posting.
---
U/tidderfox based on your comment history I can tell you bring absolutely nothing of intelligence to conversation.
---
Kind of a shame but understandable.
---
Nah, that's BoP. All BoE's are all need
---
I'll try to avoid this garbage as much as I can, Thunder Bluff master race.
---
They're also typically idiots.  Charge in, and smash WW.
---
The early responses to this post really gives you insight into how little of the people in here played vanilla and gamed in that era..
---
Agreed. TBC did wonderful things for class builds and spec viability, but that was just about the only aspect of the expansion that wasn't a dumpster fire.
---
Bracers and Belt added in Phase 2.
---
The only things atm that could sell even close to 45g in beta are BIS at level cap. So that's not relevant here
---
Even then I can't imagine it going for that much
---
&gt; Being a newbie and not knowing any of the raids/dungeons or even classes properly, i am afraid that i won't be able to enjoy the game to the fullest.
---
This is the absolute best place to be in Classic WoW. If I could remove that part of my brain that remembers Warcraft, I would without hesitation.
---
Learning about the game while playing it will net you the absolute fullest experience possible. Don't be intimidated by the elites and speed-runners. That is not how the game needs to be played. Classic is beautiful in it's design that allows you to play how you want, when you want, as slow as you want from the entire 1-60 journey.
---
&gt;greatest city in warcraft
---
&gt;It's literally a mud hut
---
Yeah ok, dailies bad. But if you felt forced to log in for dailies to get gold, you will feel forced to log in to farm and get gold. Dailies just made it easier.
---
Great, thanks! Getting even more hyped for release now! I know I'll be able to deal with thebslow leveling, but the lack of closer is gonna drive me crazy haha. Might get holy shock from or level engineering earlier than I thought just for the sappers
---
some people are going to be idiots and assholes.  ignore them, have fun.
---
you will not have a problem finding a guild.  I would suggest not being on an elitist/world first/no meme build/min maxer guild.  Even if I were a veteran who never let his subscription lapse for a single day for 15 years, i wouldn't play with one of those guilds because they suck the joy and fun out of the game anyway.
---
my guild/raid leader on the Pserver i play on is a damned enhancement shaman for crying out loud.  But he is fun, and we have fun, and i wouldn't have it any other way.
---
The truth is that there are going to be people who never played vanilla.  or never played wow.  or only played wow 15 years ago and those memories are faded and fuzzy at best.  or maybe they turned 21 in 2003 and spent the next 3 years of their lives parting and blind stinking drunk so the memories of wow evaporated with their youth(wait, maybe that was too specific)  I would welcome you into my guild with open arms and would love to show you the ropes.  If only to few the game vicariously through fresh eyes.
---
enjoy being a noob, you will never get to be a noob again.
---
From my understanding and from listening to Sharms recent videos DW tanking won’t happen until people far outgear content. DW tanking with the increase 9% parry will wreck tanks.
---
I used to buy obscure vendor recipes (mostly engineering stuff I think) and sell them on the AH for a considerable markup.
---
He means 3 or 4 times the gold invested
---
HOW IS THIS EVEN A COMMENT?
---
Is this your website?  Why do you keep spamming it?
---
Highly disagree gear &gt; gold. As long as they equip it they needed it fair and square.
---
I'm going to say no, based on [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Making_a_macro) resource:
---
&gt; Only the "secure" commands respond to macro options. In fact, the secure commands are the reason macro options were created in the first place. Insecure commands like chatting, emotes, etc. can be scripted using Lua and the /run command. Furthermore, Blizzard didn't want to confuse people who use semicolons in their chat messages. If /say could use macro options, the following would always just say "Hello":
---
&gt;   /say Hello; I'm a n00b
---
Playing casually. lol
---
Exactly. Any group I am leader of it will be everyone rolls need on anything BoE. Period. It's BoE. You can't guarantee what anyone does with it, so everyone should get their chance to do what they want. You want to give it to your friend? Fine. Need, win, trade it to him.
---
People knew what hit% did, but look at videos of high level guilds clears. People are in tier sets instead of there BiS gear.
---
I collected tier 2 for PvP never really cared about optimizing pve dps, but there were people that exclusively did PvE and used their tier sets.
---
Mainly Fury. Death and Taxes. Going through old screens of top alliance guilds.
---
&gt; The full value is the value the market assigns for it, BoPs have a set vendor price and is not subject to market pricing and therefore cannot capture the "full" value of an item, an upgrade will in almost any case be worth more than the vendor price.
---
The market price for a BoP item using this logic, is vendor price. 
---
&gt;For BoEs however the market decides the price
---
and again, for BoP's is vendor price. The only way to overcome the inconsistency in your application here is to say that gold is not universally valued.
---
Last time I saw that on youtube, all the songs that were originally used were cut for DMCA reasons or whatever.  Find a video with the songs intact!  You'll know you're there when you have 'take it to the limit' stuck in your head when you're done.
---
Yup that's why your next comment agrees with me. You sure sounds fucking dumb calling me out then agreeing.
---
One of the worst things will be forcing yourself to log off because you have to, not because you’re done your daily chores.
---
i Scam my mother , i drank water alone today !
---
Aswell as the fact that higher parry = more damage on the tank = more defensives and less TPS.
---
What’s the easiest route for a lowbie gnome/dwarf to reach Darkshore?
---
You literally have no way to back that statement up with facts since Classic isn't even released yet.
---
It's also insane.
---
Hide his name? It'll take all of 5 minutes to track him down post level 25 when you can /who for the zone his character is in.

and what planet do you come from where raid comps have 8 warlocks?

this is the EK master map: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/c5e3w5/a_few_people_were_asking_for_a_full_map_eastern/

This one's better.
---
Is this zone also a reference to the Magic: The Gathering card of the same name?
---
Pretty rough as shaman or paladin. Priest and druid are actually pretty solid.
---
Stfu Jordan ya snake
---
No, the Orcs under the leadership of Orgrim Doomhammer took Stormwind in the First War and razed it to the ground. That's the whole reason it needed to be rebuilt by the masons (later the Defias Brotherhood).
---
This guy is getting branded a ninja in vanilla for sure. Roshbank 2.0 up here
---
I don't know if they used world buffs or not, but I'm 100% sure they weren't world buffed all the time. I know that Nihilum had them for their world first kills.
---
... Did they? Did they really? They swindled how many thousands of people into prepurchasing a AAA title a YEAR IN ADVANCE. I'm actually amazed people aren't in uprest over this to be honest.
---
It's sad to say but any release and patch can be tracked to a fiscal cycle now. Why release Wc3 before wow when people are playing retail? It's going to come soon after their projected decline in Vanilla, shockingly about 2-3 months in.
---
Look at the new model of exclusive new skin / design mounts for 6 month subs. First the ship, now this new one. It's actually comical how the masses gobble it up.
---
Time is money friend.
---
you are not alone... I will be in similar position. I have started with wow on pservers during tbc and on blizzard server during cataclysm prepatch (my parents are anti gamers and would never pay subscription for me... and my english knowledge were nonexistent in those times). 
---
I will play dwarf hunter (my retail char, based on riflemen from WC3- how I loved them as child). But after I read all those guides on internet, I am affraid if I will be able to get some spot in raid group. Anyway I am sure that classic will be great experience even for someone like me who have never played it (on pserver I played resto shaman, with hunter I started since cata).
---
So yeah... I was affraid as well. I wasnt sure if I can play this and not be called noob whole time because I dont know something (be called huntard for screw something sometimes is ok I think). But after I read answers here, I will play it. Just hope I will find some friends, who will be ok with someone who dont know a lot of things, but is willing to learn it. Unfortunately most of my retail collegues just told me to fuck off when I asked them on classic (or they stop to play at all).
---
Only possible gnome is a female warrior called executie
---
Awesome. Thank you so much for these
---
I mean if you want ill gladly take you on and show you. I dont know how victims or what ever has to do with this, because as I see it the 40 people in a raid are just like the 6 pokemon in your party. They all have different strengths and weaknesses.
---
Its not about what that population ratio is... Horde has better pvp racials so it attacks more pvp only players.  Alliance has better pve racials so it attracts more pve only players.  Put those together and bam more horde queuing when pop is 50/50.
---
Much better optimization, rotations, consume and buff use get the numbers to where they are on pservers. I really doubt much will change
---
I think it just made sense for him to be the villain from a gameplay/hype standpoint at that time in WoW's life. I always got the impression that they just needed a reason to go to Outland, as that was the content that was closest to being completed (Hellfire Peninsula was going to be in Vanilla at some point).
---
I think if you get quest as your chosen race it just directs you to the other race class trainer where the quest normally picks up from anyway with few acceptions.
---
No...we definitely called rolling need on something you're selling ninjaing. Value is irrelevant if someone equips it
---
That's the only thing up in the most hidden recesses of my mind that's holding me back from making an account. I know right where every thing is an exactly how to get it. And once i make it to 60 I'll be working another 40 hour week farming mats for stonescale oils and greater fire protection pots. Plus actual raid time
---
https://www.pcgamewallpapers.net/1920x1080/wow-orgrimmar-wallpaper/ 
---
This deserves a shitpost tag. This low effort Gimp filter you've put on top of the original puts Orgrimmar to shame.
---
Unless he's deadset on being Elemental, of course.
---
Really wouldn’t call morrowgrain turns ins as engaging as pvp no matter how much you do of it.
---
Mace Rogues only for maximum stunning surprises.
---
What the fuck is a Stormwind? I've never even heard of that city, and I've played every good race in WoW.
---
Second greatest.
---
Please, share what free resource you've provided to the community that has given you such a high horse to sit on.
---
More parry haste = more rage = more tps.
---
The leadership of Blackhand, too. Again, under the influence of the burning legion. That’s why y’all have that disgusting green hue to your skin, remember? Cause you used steroids to beat us.
---
You can 'guarantee' that because you are 21 years old and think people are poor in the US because they are too lazy to read financial advice books.  
---
I.e. you have no clue how little you know.
---
Why are you assuming more people will pick horde?
---
It doesn't make a difference which faction you pick, guild chats were much the same.
---
That is literally "no one can ninja it if we all ninja it" 
---
To prevent the person or people who need it from getting fucked over youball fuck them over? What kind of assbackwards logic is that?
---
and not to mention, any expansion older than like lets say wrath or cata didnt have any gear that was relevant in the raid tiers prior to that of the current patch. When they introduced warforging and titanforging in WoD and onwards gear really stopped meaning crap, since any item you got in a dungeon could be better than any raid item.
---
&gt; I am sure they will reveal it
---
they are planning to hide it, though its anyone's guess as to how well that will work  
---
they want an organically populated server like everyone wants, and they know people want to avoid them, which would harm their plans. They wont be advertising it.  
---
Essentially, they are trying to trap people who dont know any better and its undeniably shitty. they want all the advantages of being a streamer but none of the disadvantages
---
I always recommend everyone to need on valuable BoEs at the start of a dungeon run.
---
**Scenarios for comparison: 4 good guys, 1 ninja**
---
Scenario 1 (greed): 1 guy needs it, 1 guy ninjas, the rest greed.
---
Odds for the ninja to ninja: 50/50.
---
Scenario 2 (need): 1 guy needs it, 1 guy ninjas, the rest need.
---
Odds for the ninja to ninja: 20% chance.
---
Whether to trade it to the person who needs it or to sell it is up for discussion, either way needing is preferrable to greeding in case of ninjas. Really valuable stuff like Edgemaster's Handguards are generally sold, and that's fine - most classes get several prebis pieces from the gold.
---
For me it comes down to levels of competence. I've raid led many private servers and I will always take the competent new player who listens and doesn't make the same mistakes more than once. Most elitists arent as good as they think and like to critique every little thing. "Hey, I just noticed you only casted 55 frostbolts, you could improve your dps with less downtime" meanwhile they end up dying to mechanics they've done "hundreds of times". There's also the guys that like to add something to every boss fight. "Make sure you stay on Chromagg until 1 second before breath to maximize dps." No, listen to what I said and go out when I call it. Dead people dont do any dps.
---
Ignore the nonsense people replied.
---
The difference is that Fury only works if the tank has high threat, and new Parry amount changes the method used for high threat.
---
Working fine for the rest of us man, no clue what to tell you.
---
Maybe uninstall and reinstall?
---
Definitely no one has ever asked this question so clearly it has to be a problem on your end.
---
There's no trucks in World of Warcraft!!!
---
I tried so hard to avoid names used in wow (chillwater, chillwind and whitewater were already used) I forgot to check all the other franchises too
---
Thanks! I really appreciate you watching!
---
As if I could forget. Listen Uther, there's something about ret pallies that you should know....
---
Oh no, we're too late. None of these shitters are healing. They may look fine now, but it's only a matter of time before they roll on warrior gear!
---
You'll probably be running Windows in something like Parallels.
---
&gt; I have neither the time nor inclination to do either of those things, but I do have the time and inclination to let potential pallytanks know that this list isn't good.
---
Your contribution is noted. It's worthless, but it's noted.
---
I have talked about it with a friend today! But didn't knew when they changed. Thanks!
---
stop poking me
---
For sure. I do think minmaxing impacts raids and what not too, but its just not important compared to knowing the fundamentals. Its like trying to cook an advanced dish before you learn how to boil an egg. You first learn the basics, then after some time you can go that minmax route.   
---
In short: If you are a first timer/relatively new to classic, just dont bother minmaxing at all unless thats extremely important to you. You will find groups as a human priest, its not an issue.
---
For the horde, boys.
---
Tailoring, Alchemy
---
I can almost guarantee that this isn't a dev decision, but a management decision. We can complain all we like, but I'm guessing that language based servers and RP servers were axed out of the budget to keep the project as light on expenditure as possible. When the demand is seen by whoever is making these decisions that will change, but I don't see that happening before the game launches. In their eyes its easier (and cheaper) to scale up to meet demand than to scale down because of a lack in it.
---
Then that guy gets ridiculed and shunned by the entire server. It's already happened in beta with a guy named Roshbank.
---
If you do that you're just another ninja if someone legitimately needs it. 
---
"We're all gonna screw over who actually needs it so we don't get screwed over" is incredibly stupid logic
---
It's a fun quest, but I wish I had held out for Ashjre'thul.  It's a substantial upgrade over Rhok'Delar (30-40 dps).
---
Well in all honesty no guild played optimal by the extreme standards of today, so you may not find them at the top that often. But the video I linked above, along with several others on that YT channel show fury doing pretty well. Certainly top 10.
---
You sit there and watch them equip it always.
---
Im just taking the piss man, all im saying is minmaxing is irrelevant to 95% of the playerbase. If its your thing, go for it.
---
Should clarify I play in EU.
---
Yep, not tryin to flame the class just plays different, for the most part paladins dont actually cross warriors much on gear at all unless the warrior is gear hogging 1h and 2h weapons. And I dont for sure know the newest meta for ret pallys but alot of people have been going stuff like ironfoe which is new to me. For the most part they can stack 2h weapons with slow speed and chance on hit for damage or whatever similar to ashbringer and sulfuras to do decent. Both ret and prot are really odd so i wasnt flamin just recommending talk to someone that lives and breathes those specs for good ideas of where the meta is at now. Good work overall on the whole site and it is very helpful.

No, Orgrim Doomhammer killed Blackhand, eradicated the Shadow Council, and then took Stormwind. He never drank Mannoroth's blood.
---
1g,5, then increase by 5g each time up to what I thought was a cap of 50g but I could be mistaken.

&gt;So I know it ultimately becomes 100g to respec

Do you tho?

1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,. 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 (cap)
---
Drops by 5 a month to a low of 15.
---
Yep thats what i said. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Leading up to the beta release I knew for sure that I wanted to main warrior and my buddy was gonna be a priest. He didn’t get into the beta and I didn’t want to make a warrior so as not to spoil anything for us.
---
Ended up just picking a class that I felt like playing at the time and now there is no chance I will be maining anything but a Warlock!
---
If you are sweating the decision this much it means you will be happy playing just about anything. Go with your gut feeling on the morning of release!
---
Nothing funny about this :-( goes deep into the soul
---
IE
---
Thank you for your work! It's much appreciated, especially the less popular spec itemization!
---
Right well don't be surprised if you get called a ninja looter for this. Don't need on BOEs if someone actually needs it. If no one needs it everyone rolls need.
---
If anyone needs it greed that shit.
---
&gt;You're right that punishment is reactive, but how else could you have it be?
---
I told you.  Everyone rolls need.  That's what we're arguing about.
---
&gt;Imagine if we said well some people will steal therefore if the opportunity to steal arises everyone can
---
Theft requires prior ownership.  I can't steal a quarter I found on the ground.  No one has a right to loot unless ownership (or a system for determining ownership) is established beforehand.  This is why you can't outright dismiss the value and importance of player culture, re: everyone on my server traditionally rolling need.
---
* I think we both agree, as do the vast majority of players, that BoP gear should be given to whoever can extract the most value from it: cloth spell damage gear goes to caster DPS, leather agility gear goes to Rogues or Feral Druids, main spec before off spec, etc.
---
* I argue that BoE gear is the same.  It goes to whoever can extract the most value from it.  The difference here is that in many cases, particularly those that spark forum drama, the highest and best use of BoE gear is found on the auction house.
---
&gt;As for the Staff of Jordan question, I'd deal with it the way the system was intended. If you want to sell it, you greed. If you want to use it need. There isn't any arbitrary measurements that way. It's objective. It's simple.
---
I disagree here.  Why should the Druid or Priest in that example get to roll?  It's clearly a caster DPS weapon.  Is the Hunter who thinks everything is a Hunter weapon allowed to need roll on a 500g twink caster staff because he wants to use it?  What happens when he wins the need roll and the Mage accuses him of ninjaing it (and who could blame him)?  You say it's objective, I say that's a Mage weapon all day long.  Rolling need on any BoE world drop is objective.  No gray area, no arbitrary measurements, no potential mischief.
---
If you wanna pick a few classes to avoid.
---
In PvP shamans, paladins and hunters were significantly weaker than the other 6 classes in 2s and 3s. 
---
Shamans and paladins were solid in 5s though. 
---
Hunters just weren't ideal in any bracket throughout that whole expansion.
---
A non social activity vs. A solo one. Im all for being compelled to do something daily for rewards.
---
Just make THOSE THINGS social / community based, also difficulty would go a long way. 
---
Gotta find that balance.
---
It's still more useful. None of the items saw nerfs.
---
TBC never made a lick o' sense, thematically. At level cap you go to the Plaguelands and see Naxxramas floating over it, eventually entering the citadel to defeat Kel'Thuzad. Whereupon you immediately forget all about the Lich King and the threat the Scourge still poses to Azeroth and instead hop through the Dark Portal to Outland to deal with Kael'Thas and Illidan... Because Reasons?
---
If you want to bring the Illidari back into the story (and why wouldn't you, that's some cool shit), have them reactivate the Dark Portal and invade Azeroth after the Lich King has been dealt with. This leads nicely into further Legion hijinks because of course that's why Illidan had come home again.
---
I get that Hellfire Peninsula is part of the game's lore and I'd even be alright with it being included in WoW as long as it's just another high-level zone, and not a terribly important one at that.
---
Why the fuck do people try to play games in Linux?  I just don't understand...
---
[Insert Nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1vF3-BsoxE)
---
So then stop being so defensive and get with the times. Just because you haven’t heard of Discord in your five minutes of research since coming back to gaming doesn’t mean you are up to date. Everyone is telling you to download discord and you are throwing a fit.
---
Bravo!
---
There was a public stress test some time ago and it appeared for literally everyone to be able to participate. You will be unable to play even if you add a subsciption because this is not the actual beta however maybe they do another stress test in future and you can make a character and play while it lasts. Regards
---
Ironforge looks odd
---
I got chills watching that
---
This is part of the vanilla challenge that has been forgotten by many.
---
Are you talking about soloing a 60 dungeon? Not sure that is possible in vanilla.
---
 There is a reason nihilium didn’t use 5 fury dps
---
Darnassus gang what up?
---
It already is. OP just ran it through a crappy filter to make it look like a paint. Here: https://i.imgur.com/lqcMMmT.jpg
---
Yeah I'm just saying the "but blizz doesn't wznt to hurt BFA"thing is kinda ridiculous.
---
And yes they need more testers that's total invites. We're down to &lt;100/fac, and were at 600/fac at the start.
---
And lose
---
&gt; because it's unlikely future content or a new expansion will over write your efforts.
---
huh? we already know they are doing this in phases, and unless classic  is a miserable failure they'll have to keep it going *somehow*. guess whats the likeliest possibility?
---
The horde was only able to take storm wind due to Llanes assassination. Dirty tactics, no honor. What is a *slave* doing talking back at an Alliance masterrace anyway? Back to your camp, mongrel.
---
Except bubble, and it doesn’t even really matter if they hamstring your shaman before you purge their BoF, for example.
---
guess i just found my new computer background...thanks
---
In my case because I don't have another operating system and I haven't needed one? All the games I play (SC:BW, Vanilla WoW, Dota 2 and MTGO) work on linux and I havent owned a windows pc in 10 ish years?
---
Reverse Psychology at its best.
---
It’s a bit different and we have rules that go with it. The main dkp system works like a normal dkp system. A blind bid is probably what we are going to go with but still working out some kinks. RNP is a set amount of points given at the start of a raid night that only lasts for that night. They do not stack like dkp. A dkp bid always trumps a RNP bid. Those players that are saving for an item that they really want will bid dkp like normal. If an item drops that nobody wants people can bid their RNP for offspec, or if the person is new to the guild, without spending their dkp on something. Our intention is to help gear people/specs with some less desirable loot instead of just disenchanting everything when some people could use it. It also helps from a new person coming in a taking an item that never drops from a main core raid that has been saving for weeks. But that alt/new person still has a chance of getting loot and building their own dkp for better stuff.
---
You should record a video explaining this
---
I saw a photo of the empty room with the remote in the bed on Facebook and the caption said “only real gamers know where that remote is going” I felt like the only one who really got it

Fury has No treat dump
---
Bosses avoidances on pservers were wrong 
---
Therefore less tank treat
---
It’s quite simple
---
The wow token absolutely hurts the economy. I don't understand how people don't get this. It makes buying gold much more mainstream and creates a huge incentive to farm gold (because it can be traded for something that's not in game items), which ultimately causes runaway inflation.
---
Stopping some people from investing time into acquiring gear from a bad BiS list is far from worthless.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion nowadays, but you should've used greed, because:
---
\- As someone already stated, BoE items can be an upgrade to anyone because you can sell it and buy an upgrade for your class / current equipment.  
---
\- Needing items are for BoP items that can't be exchanged/sold and are a direct upgrade to your class / equipment.  
---
\- The need &gt; greed on BoE philosophy came after BoE items and social interactions meant nothing, i.e. after WoTLK and class / equipment balances, which was aggravated by the diminishing of social interactions due to the QoL changes to group (group finder, raid finder, etc) people started to care less for the other players intentions.  
---
\- When I played wow in Vanilla the norm was to greed BoE items, roll on chests and DKP for Tier / end-game items.
---
tbc dailies provided alternate gear paths or cosmetic rewards.  i never felt obligated to do ogrila or skyguard because nothing appealed to me.  
---
i guess if there's a piece of gear that's an upgrade you're obligated to do it, but it's the same logic as raid lockouts just daily instead of weekly and you can progress at your own pace; no one is forcing you to do anything.  i don't recall any piece of daily quest rep gear being better than something from a raid but, if so, who cares because you're getting a better than raid quality item guaranteed after x amount of time.
---
100g is for two respecs (50g to spec for farming/PvP, then another 50g to go back to raid spec).
---
One of every single trade mat listed at 10x value

LOL Rogues harder to level then warriors? Thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard. I got my ganking rogue to 30 in less time played then i got my warrior to level 20
---
lmao mud huts is the greatest city?
---
Wait a minute... this isn't Darnassus... OR Thunder Bluff!
---
What kinda click bait title is that?!
---
Also great picture. :)
---
Actually sad you got gold for this when you literally just took the original from a few years ago, passed it through a photoshop painting filter and posted it with the implication that it's some original. You even cropped out the artists name. Disgusting.
---
I mean that's missing so much nuance in that statement its hardly funny, but okay, sure dig through my history to find shit to fling at me instead of addressing my current statements and proving me wrong. 
---
How is classic raiding harder than mythic Kil'Jaden and the like? Break it down for me. Player APM, logistics going into the raid race, boss mechanics, etc. Break down how the fuck I'm wrong. Last I checked Vanilla raiders didn't sim or splitrun, many of the staples of hardcore play on retail and on private servers frankly didn't exist. 
---
Hypothetically, even if I'm an inferior player to the literally who the other dude was on about, with the tools that modern hardcore raid teams have, I would end up having a better showing by virtue of having better tools and better raiding infrastructure.  
---
You're buttmad because us youngins are better at the game than your fucking boomer ass. Get over it and bow out gracefully, dont try to act like you're caught up on the modern metagame when you clearly not. 
---
Lets compare KT to bosses like Mythic Kil'Jaeden, Gul'Dan, Archimonde, Gorefiend, Blackfuse, Jaina, etc. 
---
Beat me at my own game. Prove me wrong.
---
Did someone give OP gold for posting a picture that's been on the internet for nearly 10 years and applying a shitty filter to it to try to pass it off as a painting? lol
---
You can log in and farm whenever you want.. you don't have to get once a day in order to finish the daily gold quests. That's the point. If you don't log in for dailies you miss them. 
---
It's more the feeling of you not missing anything by not logging on for a day. Or that feeling of wanting to do whatever you want during your short play period, but those dailies are lost if you don't complete them.. feels bad
---
Nice fanfic.
---
Why not start out with both skinning AND mining?
---
Then drop skinning once you have enough mats to level Eng to 300.
---
Then drop mining for Tailoring.
---
Cosmetic item shop didn't ruin WoW but it definitely makes it a worse game for having it.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5zsDGafjGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5zsDGafjGo&amp;t=279s)
---
According to this, return damage items are your best bet. I'll add Skullflame and Force reactive disc to Esfand's list.
---
Conscecration and Redoubt are needed, and blessing of sanctuary is imo recommended, which means a holy reckoning or 30/21 spec (still, you need at least one paladin in the raid for improved blessing of might, so someone has to deal with a bit worse farming).
---
People are going to get hardcore this time around.  Hunters and Druids won't get many raids spots, because everyone knows they suck ass.  We are talking 2-3 hunters, and maybe 1-3 Druids.
---
Stormwind was on fire before Garona killed Llane.
---
But I'm glad you found your Nazi roots.
---
one scam i remember back in vanilla was sending this low-level pearl COD trough mail, claiming it was some other pearl that was needed for the crusader enchant, wich was highly valued. they had the same icon so if you didnt look at the name, you fell for the scam.
---
fuck that guy. don't apologize for jumping.
---
Was it ever confirmed that didn't work? Seems like a real dick move to put that tooltip if it didn't tbh
---
Female dwarf.
---
Thought it was like that everywhere on reddit? I just click on "comments" to get to the post, simple as that
---
Funny but not sure how it relates to my question :p
---
They're not going to release an expansion over classic nor are they likely going to invalidate the raids of classic with new and far more powerful gear. If anything, they'll do community voting like OSR.
---
Rogues can still help people, they're good for CC. I play Mage the most, and sometimes I can help a stranger with CC, or a buff. I've saved plenty of lives.
---
Same - the dailies in WotLK were a big reason I quit. The high gold reward meant it was by far the most productive way to spend your time.
---
never seen thunder bluff spelled like this.  what language?
---
Nazi? Careful, Garrosh. Treading dangerous territory. The original point: Hordes best city is an Alliance sewer. Let that sink in.
---
Again? [The fuck did that sink come from?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
---
&gt; It was "a warning" only. No one has been permanently banned for doing it unless it was used as an exploit.
---
That was exactly what I said. That's why I said "will" and not "have".
---
And some dumb sucker gave OP gold for this trash post.
---
Bro it's a video game, do what you want. I'd play with friends. But I'm not you.
---
The fact that you were helping the other player means nothing that what it dropped, as you agreed to help without any other contract definitions, if you had said "I can help you, but if something drops I might need it" then you would be covered.  
---
You agreed to help out of good will, and that's your only claim here. He could let you need it out of good will too, but that's rare nowadays. So I praise for your actions on helping him, but I don't agree with you on needing the item.
---
But those are for things you personally want and you don't have a quest in your face putting pressure on you, knowing you're going to miss out if you don't do those tedious quests that day. You can put those other things off and do it when you want.. I mean, unless you're in a hardcore raid guild, but again that was your choice!!
---
"I like flightpaths and being on the worse continent" - what?
---
The shields aren’t crazy powerful and have poor scaling with +healing (only 10% scaling), so they won’t last terribly long (even less time if he’s not overgeared).  It’ll only gimp rage gen for a couple seconds. Enough to be impactful and annoying, but it’s not like he’ll be crippled for a crazy length
---
Can you make a reasonable argument for other classes having more boring playstyles? Which ones?
---
&gt; The price if WoW monthly sub hasn't gone up in a very long time. 
---
I see this argument a lot but it's not a good one. While it's true that the WoW sub hasn't gone up, the cost of running the game, particularly in terms of server infrastructure and customer support, has substantially decreased.
---
Oh jeez then you better clean your ram sticks out.
---
Paladin starts off leveling with most of the major tools that they use to level effectively (seals, judgement, might, heals) but they don't get a whole lot as they keep leveling. Other classes really grow (hunters get pet, druids get cat form, shaman get windfury) but Paladin just keeps auto attacking to 60.
---
Yeah, no. Blizzard built their reputation on "Gameplay first" and were never the least bit hesitant to bend the lore over a barrel and do unspeakable things to it in pursuit of that. TBC is the poster child for this. Fun as hell at the time, but straight-up murdered the crap out of the lore to make it happen.
---
Thing is, most of us were willing to accept the trade-off as long as the gameplay remained rock solid. Sadly, that's long since ceased to be the case.
---
If you spell “Thunder Bluff” backwards it spells “breathtaking”
---
Bubble is for 'Oh shit, I forgot to heal you for a few seconds, better drop a bubble so you don't die before I finish casting'.
---
Your warrior in this fight has already been frost shocked and earthbound.. but for your sake you can get an intercept off to the shaman, but then our warrior will also intercept your warrior stunning him just long enough for the shaman to move a bit.
---
Light be with you.
---
Hamstring kiting is Much Harder in classic bcuz of the meele leeway and sit macro for Enrage procs is confirmed to not be in classic
---
0/10.  As you can see, the stones are mortared together and not chiseled from solid stone.  You can see the sky, but that shouldn't be.  There are horde banners.  If you look closely, there are kodo and wolf mounts, not mechastriders and rams.  And the floor should be stone, not dirt.
---
I mean, the art is okay, but you got all of the details of Ironforge wrong.
---
OP mentioned they bug reported it, so hopefully it'll be fixed before release
---
Without dailies you could be creative in how you grind gold. Also dailies are linear and time gated.
---
Nobody is even on the beta anymore. Place is a ghost town. 
---
Maybe the 1 guy on there playing druid will msg you. Maybe...
---
If classic gets popular Bliz will add the wow shop to classic. In their financial report it said that a significant amount of their revenue comes from micro-transactions. It will start slowly, maybe with wow tokens. Hazz will say it is to combat gold sellers. 
---
After that many players are going to complain on the forums about wanting server and fraction transfers to play with their friends. Blizzard of course likes money and so will agree to add these services to the classic wow store. 
---
I think so far it is only a matter of when they will add these features not if. I am not sure if they will ever add store boosts, mounts or pets. However, I reckon Bliz will see how much cash they are making from the classic store and eventually add boosts, mounts and pets.
---
Hey the guy is deadset in his opinion and no amount of your words will change it. Most people would agree paladin is better but hey if he wants windfury let him have it.
---
There's no such thing as a windows PC.   There's a PC with windows on it.
---
imo your idea honestly makes no sense
---
Unpopular offtopic opinion: she's not as hot as everyone says
---
Blizzard made some of the changes I suggested in this post on the beta yesterday.
---
You are an idiot.
---
I used to be able to glitch into Nessy all the time. There's a lag macro that you spam as you jump off any transit to clip through walls. Ex pz
---
&gt; Then we burned your tree.
---
What are you talking about?  That never happened.  Wow ended after WotLK.
---
This is true. I used to DPS and offtank as arms back then. Did pretty decent on the meters too, but that's also probably because of the issues mentioned above. Most people didn't know how to gear for maximum dps.
---
Under estimate? Hit is the business until cap regardless of class.
---
Wait, what? It blows my mind that a WoW player could possibly be fat. I was like 160-170 lbs at 6'4" when I played. 
---
When you're eating food, you aren't playing WoW. And when you aren't playing WoW, that's bad. Therefore eating is bad.
---
I mean, why do something that involves *not* playing WoW when you could instead be doing something that *is* playing WoW?
---
I am envious of you. You get experience the world for the first time. 
---
There will be a few assholes telling you to l2p as you play through, ignore them. They will be telling the same thing to veteran players who don't do exactly the thing they want them to at any given moment. Instead, focus on your own journey. Wave at people and invite them to groups for doing quests. Trade buffs, explore the world. If you want to do a dungeon, ask around in chat. If you don't know it, be willing to learn as you go.
---
You don't win world of Warcraft by having the best gear and doing all the raids. You win world of Warcraft by having the best time. Enjoy playing.
---
Yeah but that is a player created situation to get a raid finished asap or farm gear it's not a game mechanic designed to get you to log in. Game developers stopped trying to make games fun so you would log back in and play they just focused on giving people fake rewards to encourage people to log in, the sad part is the amount of people that eat that shit up
---
&gt; Or C) they are playing the new patch it's not a requirement to like classic and hate retail.
---
Dunno if you know this... but the beta didn't die on Tuesday.
---
&gt;D) it's a beta and most don't have their career centered around playing a character 8+ hours a day for a character that will go bye bye in less than 2 months.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
According to Esfand's testing, the /sit works if you use the batching mechanic to make the server think you are not sitting when the crit happens.
---
Which means if the mob crits you when you are standing up, it will trigger abilities, just like in vanilla. So, classic /sit will rely much more on timing.
---
I don't even know what that means lol. Im thinking I may just dig out my Asus g74sx and update WoW from there and use that to game with
---
Assuming your warrior hasn’t already burned his intercept, pally doesn’t have BoF up, and your shaman isn’t eating so much damage he doesn’t have time to purge it through the MS trying to keep himself alive, maybe.
---
1600x1200 resolution back in 2006. that is the most impressive thing in this screenshot.
---
Sure, if they think new testers are going to provide them useful information.
---
Since they haven't, the answer to that question is pretty obvious.
---
Thanks alot!
---
When did they add the drop?   Either way, I bet the timer resets every time you respect, which makes it worthless.
---
Alright Alright, I see you need some help on your enhance bis list now that its been added.
---
I have uploaded a spreadsheet I have been working on for the last few months to Google Drive if you want to view it and make some changes to your list. I have played enhance for over 10 years and have a lot of experience in the private server 60-80 meta as well as retail experience in regards to enhance shaman gearing. Due note that Orc is required in my gearing as I feel it is required for enhance to have any viability in the raid scene. I was hesitant on releasing this sheet as it will cause the gear to go up in competition but I keep seeing so many wrong BIS lists going around regarding enhance. Anyways Enjoy.
---
Spreadsheet here : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cmBpFXK2\_9a49kJVmqq0-wJlfnfIfR0W/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cmBpFXK2_9a49kJVmqq0-wJlfnfIfR0W/view?usp=sharing)
---
They're in beta for what that's worth
---
Remember this is Activision.. the money hungry Loot Boxing assholes. The moment they see room for profits they will wiggle whatever they can into classic. I believe it 100%.
---
Nah, your pally was already dead after his bubble fell off. Unfortunately once he got earthshocked after his bubble dropped he was holy locked and couldn’t cast, and his plate gear couldn’t stop a crushing wave of Windfury proccs.
---
When people refer to the internal cooldown, they mean the 3 second one added to TBC.
---
The triple proc change isn't noticeable because a 1.3 second dagger can proc WF by chance on each 1.3 auto swing.
---
This still seems to be highly debated and I literally just got into a debate with someone on a stream. Someone can easily test this by using WF on a fast dagger in Classic. There was no internal cooldown faster than the fastest weapons on pservers.
---
Hardly sewers, most of the area is dungeons and crypts.
---
I don't think I ever felt obligated to log on to do something unless it was to help someone I told I was going to help.
---
Dailies were also the catalyst for some of the best world pvp I have ever seen. But I get it, classic good, everything else bad!
---
No warlock should be hitcapped. You gimp yourself too hard chasing 16%. In absolute bis gear you're rocking max 12-13% hit.
---
The average post BWL raider is going to rock 10-12% hit.
---
Well said. It never occurred to me as clearly as you’ve put it here, but you’ve described the exact feeling I hate about retail wow (to whatever small extent I have played in the past 10 years.)
---
It just makes the world feel less real. And it’s done purely to cater to casual players and make blizzards usage metrics look good.
---
When I was saving for my first mount in Vanilla, I would wrap white items in wrapping paper and send them to random players COD for 1G. I had a copy/paste about how it was the "Warcraft Lottery" and each gift had a chance to contain an epic item!
---
The thing was, I did legitimately send out 1 wrapped up epic BoE so it wasn't a lie. 
---
I got a 3-day ban for it, and later they made it so you couldn't send wrapped items COD.
---
Wait - was this guy  Scarab Lord too? That oil enchant icon appears to be Runesong of the Red from the AQ Chain, I don't recall that icon being anything else other than Thunderfury.
---
Okay sick. I’ve been seeing a couple people mention just to level as ret so I think I’ll do that
---
You're probably better off honestly.  A lot of game clients don't run in Mac native and instead uses additional software to use Windows so it can run them instead.
---
If you're taking your time, mining is perfectly fine to take while leveling. If you're rushing 60, Mining takes up too much time and doesn't help you level faster. For Warlock, I've found it a lot easier to focus on mining once you have your epic mount.
---
Now imagine on 5 servers: all DE and FR will jump on the PvP server to try and make it official, along with english speakers. Blizzard really think this is gonna work out ? Three communities on one PvP server? I hope they get their head out of their ass, but on that day I'm rushing that character creation for sure.
---
Hey dudes. Since people have been enjoying my simplified gearing guides, I decided to try my hand at a general guide for everyone who wants to get raid ready ASAP in WoW Classic. Since it's quite general, there's probably a few things missing for certain specs and classes, but overall I think this covers basically everyone pretty well.
---
I hope you enjoy! :)
---
yah it looked like that during vanilla wow, I never touched shit afterwards so i still remember what it looked like. The end
---
This is a big ole yikes. Trying to weird flex and claim to know what they are talking about? Kk
---
Lovely
---
I leveled on nost to 60 as a warrior and never tanked a single dungeon, didn't have a.negative impact on my experience that I was rolling against other warriors in dungeons
---
Horde for sure. I've always played horde and I'll be trying to convince some of my ex-guildmates to come back.
---
I love these videos! It takes a bit of the sadness of not getting into beta away...

You should have some of that ice pack going into the water like a glacier. Have big chunks of ice fall off periodically.
---
Same level is actually 4% chance to miss (so you wear 3%).

I played  Vanilla on a Mac for years and it was not an issue. I would say that you will probably be able to run it, but you may need to turn the graphics down a bit.
---
Don’t use bootcamp or anything like that it will eat up a lot of hard drive space without much reward. Just use the Mac version of the client. 
---
Everything is the same in terms of Addons although you will want to use the Text Edit app if you need to tweak any of the .lua files. If you intend to edit any .blps there is a Photoshop plugin that you can find to open them, but I’m not sure where any more.

"greatest"

My brother would never use a zeppelin, because his computer could not load in before it left again, keeping him on a permanent loading screen.
---
You're right, only the soakers needed NR gear. Healers and casters should never be close enough to take any nature damage.
---
Fortunately his stun could because windfury doesn’t allow you to ground it.
---
Hold on, it's no Ironforge, but it'll do.
---
This sounds doable with a classic 31/13/7 holy build. You pick up the protection talents for redoubt and improved block reduction to survive big backs, and then you rely on Retribution aura and a Crest of Retribution with a shield spike to kill things that are hitting you. You can swap to Concentration aura and heal through damage with Illumination if you need to and can't rely on Blessing of Protection.
---
I'm sorry, but that is a terrible painting of Thunderbluff.
---
North America... Probably PvP, but I'm flexible.

Horde side.

For 5 mans, literally nobody cared in PUGs. If you needed the item, you rolled need on it. Otherwise greed on everything you don't need. If it was trash and sharding the item would be worth more than the gold it produced, the enchanter would roll need, DE the item, and everyone /rolled for it. 
---
UBRS is where you start to see people organize more.
---
It’s never not fun to me, no matter what we are running. (Assuming I’m with my guild and not randoms).
---
I didn't know that. Thanks for letting me know.
---
for me personally im just competitive. I always wanted to top damage meters and did everything possible in order to do so.
---
There was also this thought that Hunters were bad PvE dps so I wanted to prove everyone wrong
---
I played competitive sports most of my life so i've always had that burning inside of me
---
Curse of Elements.
---
In my opinion, 8 warlocks is the ideal comp for naxx.
---
That just shows that you arent a good warrior. At all
---
Hmm shits so confusing. Seems like every question I ask gets contradictory answers. I think I might do what the other guy suggests, level as ret mostly but instead of legit tanking, just use tank spec to powerlevel others or solo low lvl dungeons for gold/twinks and level a warrior if I really wanna tank raids and dungeons
---
I don’t know about that. I played classic, into BC and dailies are the mechanic that finally soured the whole experience for me. Ever since then, every expansion I can last untill I hit the dailies. 
---
This is only my experience, but claiming there’s no difference is naive at best.
---
Does it also apply to mages?
---
I love Paladins and main'ed one from classic through wotlk.
---
Going ret in vanilla is going to cause so much drama and hate from total strangers.  It's ostensibly a social based game, so it just makes sense to me to avoid it.
---
Go horde, then play a belfadin in TBC.  Warrior are loot whores, and holy is OP until then.
---
Raid ready in Classic means level 58 and attuned. That's it. The week one Ragnaros killing guilds are going to be doing it in greens and quest blues.
---
Grounding totem does, if you have a good shaman, he can totem twist. Meaning he keeps WF up but can also utilize other totems of the same type. So get WF cast, paladin is getting low, expect the stun, drop grounding, absorb stun (all the while WF is still on the warrior), re-drop WF to keep it up, and you’re a goner.
---
&gt; your spells will not miss.
---
Chance to miss is 17%, but +hit cap is 16%. The remaining 1% can't be covered.
---
They are randomly generated gear and I gave an generic example of it.
---
The gear is a random default item following the convention of: 
---
in:
---
Not Yet Released sections, Items, World of Warcraft items, Game terms
---
Item suffix
---
EDIT

COMMENTS

SHARE
---
Many items have a base item name followed by a suffix. The suffixes are similar to the item naming convention used in other Blizzard games such as Diablo and Diablo II. The suffix will always start with the word of followed by a few words that indicate quickly to the player what enhancements an item will give. How much enhancement an item gives is closely tied to the item quality and item level.
---
Items of this type are normally uncommon (greens), although rare (blue) and epic (purple) ones exist. On item database websites (like Wowhead) and some crafting patterns, these items are listed with their base name (for example, Slatesteel Girdle or Pattern: Wild Leather Shoulders) and the term "&lt;Random enchantment&gt;" to indicate that the actual items have a randomly assigned enhancement matching the suffixes.
---
For the most part, animal, job and attribute suffixes are seen most commonly. Resistance and wrath drop less commonly, and the miscellaneous ones drop the least often. Of course, in some cases item suffixes are simply part of a unique name or are used to signify an item is part of a set.
---

---
Suffixes that increase a single attribute
---
Items with an "of Attribute" suffix typically have less total attribute enhancement than "of the Animal". For example, a "Shortsword of Strength" may have +10 strength, whereas a "Shortsword of the Bear" of comparable level may have +6 strength and +6 stamina.

You’re still literally squatters lmao. And proud Orgrimmar is still a dirt mound.
---
All three healers have their places in raids. Generally 4 or 5 holy pallies are needed for their important blessings: might/wisdom, light, kings, sanctuary/salvation. Their healing are strong, too.
---
Resto druid are also in fair demand due to nature swiftness insta heal especially on Alliance, battle-rez and innervate, but generally 2-3 restos per raid is enough.
---
Yeah certainly seems that way.
---
Nothing you said hurts the economy whatsoever.
---
Why does this look like Prisma app?
---
Preach!
---
As the top commenter in the original post, I'd like to reiterate this is still very cool. I have nothing extra to add but who knows maybe I'll get top comment again?
---
As a caster you stay away from the Wyvern sting range, melee are basically here to soak and so p1 damage, once she goes crazy then the caster team is far enough behind in threat to go all out.
---
My experience was about the same as yours. Everyone greeded on BOEs (honor system and personal reputation here). If a BOE dropped that someone had a legit use for (say a nice dagger dropped and a sub rogue was there) they were okayed to need it. Usually as a show of good faith these people immediately equipped the item to show that it was about. If they didn't want to actually use it they greeded like everyone else. I really liked this system, even though occasionally you'd get ninjas. It's just that ninjas didn't last too long since they quickly found themselves unable to find groups.
---
Lol, whatever you say man.
---
If it is under the "Live" tab, it is just the stress test client and not the beta.
---
I wouldn't.  I would go 1-12 Teldrassil (easily possible with a little grinding), then do 12-14 Darkshore, following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa4SuHwKULM).  He does it at 14-16, but it's doable 12-14.  After Darkshore, that's when you do the run to Ironforge by taking the boat, doing the death to port to Dun Morogh, then set your hearth in Ironforge.  Level to 16 in Loch Modan, then port back to Moonglade, get your aquatic form quest, then hearth back to Ironforge and take the tram to Stormwind.
---
You will be super ready for Westfall, you'll breeze through the quests like nothing at 16 and will get to 20 by the time you're done picking up all of the Deadmines quests.  Then you can tank or heal it.
---
Fast level 20 + good items, and you'll have most of the important flight paths.
---
Marilyn Manson was shooting a music video in our house while I was raiding. I let him talk on comms and he got so mad no one believed it was him he spit absinthe on my bedroom floor.
---
Link the screenshots please
---
Blizzard are not going to introduce the cash shop on day one. They will wait until players have invested months of /played on their characters and have made social connections within the game. At that point these players will be too invested (sunk cost) to just quit out of principle.
---
Yes, but that could just be my experience. On private realms, it was the most common composition among the top naxx guilds.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Don't you get some hit chance from talents as well?
---
I disagree with you, of course. I agree it's not a competition. Why did I put three cooldowns on a single button? They are abilities that I would want to trigger at the same time as my shapeshift, first and foremost. Of course, I'm not advocating my macros as 'the one true way'. The opposite, my macros are not optimal for PvP or raiding and I encourage you to customize.
---
A lot of people talk about a loss of information, but I've never had that experience. The thing is, I am constantly tapping modifiers to activate other abilities so I can see the cooldowns. I don't need to see every second of the cooldown. When a minute long cooldown is getting close, I can just tap modifiers during GCDs to check it frequently. 
---
Maybe you're Feral Charging on cooldown every 15 seconds because you PvP a lot. That would be a good reason to show it as the top tooltip. If you prefer, put the icons on extra bars. I don't like the visual clutter, but it's comfortable for some people.
---
I do not know when they were changed, but I would highly suspect that they went to the non-alliance architecture specific backgrounds by the time TBC came out with BE paladins.  If that was 1.9, 1.12, or 2.0 I do not know.
---
Stormwind got rebuilt and then all the people never got paid. That's some Donald Trump shit right there.
---
Np. [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zfsF9FiAuf7BLVvgZgXqiceC8iWrBmwWwHyxrxOy-5Y/edit#gid=118447046) is a big help for plotting out your gear (and your +hit).
---
I don’t think OP had a requirement on only getting replies from people playing Druid right at this very minute.... lol
---
&gt; Theft requires prior ownership.
---
Then no ninjaing would be theft and we are at an impasse.
---
Wait we forgot the most important thing. You can’t stun because your pally is holy locked..
---
Am i missing the joke here? Did he miss spell something and i can't see it?
---
Classic itemization I guess.
---
Cloth can be used by any healing class, mail/plate cannot.
---
Would have to go back in time and ask the designers their thought process.
---
Tier sets, completely different story of course.
---
I was think of icebergs off the coast, but wasn't sure how vanilla it would feel
---
(though I did subtly hint at a small tuskarr hub and no one seemed to notice)
---
I personally don't care about the "meta builds" or whatever does most DPS. I don't plan on hardcore raiding this time around so I'm just going to play something I find fun, which is an Enhancement Shaman.
---
Tank threat was the limiting factor. Fury warriors couldn't go all out like rogues for example.
---
"City".
---
That's a big word for a bunch of huts behind a gate.
---
&gt;Dungeons did not become obsolete in vanilla and tbc. You still needed to do them to gear up for raiding
---
Dungeons have almost always served this purpose until M+.
---
My point is that dungeons weren't a challenge what so ever at any point in the games history, they were also very poorly designed a lot of the time until WOTLK. 
---
Cataclysm was the first expansion where Blizzard actually put effort into dungeons and made them a challenge, gave the bosses actual tactics to follow or a competent team would wipe.
---
&gt;The skip everythingexcept the latest raid tier is also a phenomen of wrath and cata.
---
looks like a mud hut too mee.. ::shrugs::
---
That’s something we can agree on. Nothing but shitty feudalism and warlords on our Azeroth.
---
And yet since they turned the ban into a warning in April, people have continued to swap models and not get banned.
---
Nah not the whole dungeons. In the case of DM N. You are AOE grinding non-elite I'll call them "herb" elementals. In the case of Strathholme you are grinding elite skeletons. However they aren't immune to your frost slows. So they can kill you but, they never reach you to do that.
---
Westfall is better to do at level 16 IMO.  You do all of the same quests, but it's actually fun and not awful trying to kill fleeing humanoids before they pull more and you die.  Darkshore is better earlier on because more of the mobs are beasts, etc and they're more spread out.  Save the harder zone for higher levels, it will save you tons of time and effort.
---
It's the one you open to play stress tests when those servers are up. Beta is under "IN DEVELOPMENT" and is called "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic".
---
Trying to figure that out myself.
---
5 set bonus is worth almost 20% spell haste which is better than 200 +healing and 20 Mp5 via stat weighting. At least for the raiding scene and raid healing shamans who are only casting chain heal.
---
I mean I was just trying to illustrate a point-of-view you claimed you didn't understand, assuming you were actually curious about the loads of people who prefer PVP realms. Seems I failed though!
---
I feel that players who get especially upset about dying or being killed tend to be people who have difficulty managing the emotional aspect of pvp (ie controller throwers). It's supposed to be an emotional response, for sure, but what you get out of it depends on what you put into it. If you want to be pandered to, never die, feel OP all of the time, that's what modern WoW is for! 😊
---
Tranq shot is pretty much required for several bosses.
---
You do want to keep 1 soulstone up on the raid (assuming you have zero shaman with reincarnation, and assuming your paladins don't get off a Divine Intervention.) Basically, it's something you don't have to think about.
---
CoE and CoS last ~5 minutes, which is much longer than most fights. So once they're applied the first time, you can stop thinking about them.
---
Things are slightly more complex if you're the one warlock in the raid who gets to play SM/Ruin. That warlock can throw corruption (assuming the raid is min:maxing debuff slots), and they can spam shadowburn (assuming they're willing to farm soul shards for a minor dps increase.)
---
But all in all, you don't need situational awareness through most of vanilla. The average warlock's damage rotation will literally be spamming the 1 key.
---
I mean...
---
When logging off at the inn to get some rested EXP and take a break for the game was rewarding, not punishing. They wanted people to take a break and feel okay doing so. Amazing how everything changed. Haven't even played since BC and I'm sitting here waiting for all of that stuff I never got to accomplish to come back so I can do so -  and I played the game extensively back in Vanilla days! Just didn't raid like crazy, hoping to eventually get into it and get past Molten Core.
---
Perfectly viable.
---
&gt; It fixed a lot of problems with class design though.
---
No, it didn't. It made every spec viable in PvE. There is nothing wrong with having certain specs being non-viable in PvE to give it unique advantages in PvP. BC is when Blizz kept caving to the whiners. Everything had to be everything.
---
You have to start the druid quests in Darnassus.  Nobody else starts them in vanilla.
---
I never leveled an undead character until Wrath because my computer couldn't handle Tristfall Glades or Silverpine forest.
---
2019 wow being BFA :D
---
They made the changes before you made this post (which was today). I don't understand. You worded that reply as if they made YOUR suggestions lol.
---
I am an idiot, sure. But I know how the search function works on Reddit, so..........
---
No they have to be! It could have changed since 30 minutes ago!!!!!
---
At level 15 on the stress test I got a couple drops
---
The problem is that with all the people at launch it will take quite some time to tag/killl/loot those 3 mobs. 
---
On the stress test it was well over 20 minutes and that was because I was lucky, after 20 minutes of running around trying to melee or shadowbolt something.. seems like they were messing with layering and suddenly all mobs instantly respawned along a couple of players and I was quick enough to tag a couple before everything instantly died and everyone was back to running around trying to tag stuff
---
&gt; I mean that's missing so much nuance in that statement its hardly funny, but okay, sure dig through my history to find shit to fling at me instead of addressing my current statements and proving me wrong.
---
I just wanted to see what kind of person you were.  
---
Split running, reading boss mechanics, simming etc do not in itself require better players. Yes, today you could run a dps sim and fine tune everything, and that would make you come out on top. That started   
---
The players we had who were good are still good, because much of the skills and dedication they had is the same as what's needed today. Sims, splitruns, prepping before are worthless timesinsks and if noone does it (like old vanilla) you probably don't have to either.  
---
Effing our boomers still in top 10 guilds and our casual boomer run still hit top 200 last expo with raids being dropped cause people have other obligations.  
---
Player skill isn't higher. 2006 EJ wasn't dogshit, and it's players or our naxx players don't have an issue handling modern mechanics. It's just different requirements from back in the day.
---
Come DM release you can just do jump runs. Until then you will just have to make do, but seeing as the hard raids and PvP won't be out at the time, you won't need much money.
---
When did that become the standard? That seems so selfish.
---
If someone in the group can actually use it and it's an upgrade they should get the item. 
---
When did everyone get so selfish? I dont remember that ever being a thing on daggerspine US
---
If specced MM they bring good utility and buffs. Aspect of the Wild is required in AQ20/40 and on certain bosses in Naxx. So there will always be atleast 2 - 3 hunters in every raidgroup.
---
Then why keep saying it? Always gotta be at least who has to make sure people know their dislike of Apple products any time someone dares mention on. It’s obnoxious. He didn’t ask for opinions on them.
---
If you join a decent guild, you clear MC/BWL in one raid night. Raiding one night a week is not the most tragic if you ask me
---
Befriend a tank.  Do DME jump runs. Sell loot, disenchant blues sell on AH and mine the rich vein
---
He’s meme’ing. Everybody on the Alliance used IF as hub especially when AH was split.
---
Lmao, you realise they are specifically designed with the idea he described in mind right? Makes no sense? Im sure thats why 90% of all game companies today use that exact idea over and over again.
---
It makes sense. So your opinion is wrong.
---
Kinda sucks that I gotta ruin the joke by explaining it, but...
---
The joke is that the only "good" races are horde's races, and since none of them are allied to Stormwind, I've never "heard of stormwind".
---
Since when? We never did that back in the day... even BoE epics, if someone was actually going to use it, they rolled need and equipped. If not you roll greed.
---
The fastest way to level is to do all of the quests in both Darkshore and Westfall.  IDK how many of you remember vanilla, but the idea that you can level 10-20 in Westfall or whatever is insane.  I end up hitting Darkshore, Loch Modan AND Westfall in my leveling route since there's not enough quests to do the grind.
---
So what really matters is what order you hit the zones in.  Westfall is 100% always best to do last, since you have more annoying mob placements and more fleeing mobs in cramped areas.
---
Unless you plan on parking your druid at 40 I wouldn't worry too much.
---
Um I'm not the one that said it ask him lol
---
But if you come into a gaming forum and ask about mac nonsense you know what you are walking into
---
I agree with the Hunter and Druid, IIRC most of the time atleast 1 hunter was brought and depending on the raid/fight more would be brought. I always heard of two druids, one to tank/offtank and one to heal. Then those extras spots are brought in depending on the raid, I doubt 8 warriors will be brought outside of 4 Horseman in Naxx. Then again, I think raid comps will be flexible.
---
Why would I pay for an operating system that I havent used in a long time when everything I need from a computer is doable on linux? Its just thay classic is releasing and pservers are dying so I have to get classic running on my pc. Also learning windows would probs cost me more time and effort than getting classic running on linux.
---
what if there's a dps warrior in your group? Those are BiS gloves for a long time, why can't they have them?
---
That’s a good point
---
Yes, even more so for mages. They don’t get a free mount at 40. That’s really only if you’re rushing to 60. If you’re taking your time I think it’s fine to take.
---
&gt; My practical experience though was as a 29 holy pally twink in BC. I made sure to wear mostly Stam/int mail and was unstoppable
---
That's a twink, not so much at 60 where you have so many more tools  at your disposal such as divine shield, blessing of protection, blessing of freedom.
---
Shields make a huge difference.
---
If you look at druids with no shield or plate, they don't normally die in a rogue stunlock. (Unless the gear difference is MASSIVE, but even then plate isn't going to save you)
---
Going back in time, if you watch "world of roguecraft" they kill warriors, with a worn dagger. (0.9 DPS dagger, literally the STARTER weapon) And yes it's old and not on 1.12/1.13 but still the point stands rogues are very deadly, stunlocks are nuts, but with the tools at the paladin's disposal, it's not hard to live through the stunlock and allow yourself to heal up after, even wearing a few cloth pieces, alongside leather.
---
Plate while amazing, isn't going to save you against wound poison if you have no +healing.
---
If you don't remember logging in to stand on the "original" org bank roof while waiting for the raid to form................... then you've never vanilla'd.
---
?
---
You call him out for never playing classic, but then refer to raiding, something only about 10% of the whole classic playerbase even tried once? Nice logic there bud.
---
&gt; have no access to unique farming areas
---
Tanking strat and reserving the first orb is pretty god damn lucrative.
---
So just like every other time in WoW's history?
---
This happened to me once in retail vanilla, also when alt-tabbing, cool to see this bug still exists lol.
---
You will be fine, I'm going to bring in a couple of newbs myself and that lifeblood is important. I'm not going to go hardcore and level day and night, simply going to take my time and enjoy the game. Role-play a little, build groups and friendships, and enjoy myself. Sure, there will be plenty who go for the end-game content and level as fast as possible, but they'll burn out or leave after a few months, while there will be many who simply come back and play now and have fun.
---
yeah... wotlk  naxx was 10man and 25 man version. In Ulduar they  added heroic modes on bosses and since ToC there was 10man/10HC and 25man/25HC until 4.3 when they added LFR and that was until 5.4 when they added flex version and in WoD they started with the mythic bullshit.
---
back when i played wow (vanilla up to cata) on daggerspine US rolling need and selling something was the definition of ninja looting
---
Trolls look absolutely ridiculous in any gear, easy call.
---
Look, I've legitimately been enjoying our discussion but you really need to read the rest of that paragraph.
---
Many vanilla wow Naxx kills have a healthy amount of hunters. People are disillusioned by the speed clear meta going on with private servers.
---
daggerspine US... same here, if you rolled need for the purpose of selling something you were a ninja looter
---
They're in the game now. Just because you haven't seen any on the auction house doesn't mean anything. People have been Green Lens of X Wrath for weeks.
---
If I had to guess, they're planning a July subscription cash grab similar to the August early naming cash grab.
---
yeah i like the clarity of the original better, can see the orcs and what theyre doing, etc.
---
Most people skip the Cure Poison quest until way later, Abolish Poison is just better
---
For me, being a healer wasn't really about the "support" role, I just found 40-man whack-a-mole infinitely more engaging than hitting the same button to attack a boss for 15 minutes.
---
You're never a jerk. The game can absolutely be played without macros, the content wasn't designed with it in mind.
---
But yes, I think macros literally make your character more powerful. Without them, you can't use @mouseover targeting and you can't abuse the GCD, as a bare minimum.
---
I was going to say that casters only use one spell when they raid. But honestly it's still more exciting than paladins.
---
Differing opinions are literally violence.
---
Except for Ironforge. The greatest city. Just bringing it back to what matters.
---
This isn't Ironforge
---
You mean like the cash mount/pet shop?
---
Who cares?   
---
Would you rather have 
---
A)No wow classic
---
or
---
B)Wow classic but with an optional cash mount shop
---
I mean I know some people on here are crazy zealots who are going to reply "well obviously A and then I'll just keep stealing the game on a private server" but cmon lol.
---
If wow classic is somehow ever more popular than retail you bet your ass new features are going to start getting added.
---
Beautiful!
---
Why did you think I was mad? And why are you accusing me of "not saying anything" when your own response to me was "Okay?" ... are you really that unaware?
---
I'm saying that there was a time where not many people cared about the math. People played what was cool and fun. Gamers aren't like that anymore. They are all about gold/hour and "viable" and "meta" ... etc. I think that's fine. But it's not how I enjoy games. And, by the way, this newer philosophy (let's call it "math or something") is what fucked WoW over in the first place. People did some math and then did some more bitching and now all classes are the exact same. So thanks a lot, Math!
---
A parry is average 0.24something faster swing. It's not like parry or few parries in a row are deadly.
---
Since no one else has responded, I’ll give my minimal experience input.  I first started playing WoW late in Vanilla (September/October 2006).  Very first character I made was a human warlock and loved every minute of it.  I did NOT get to level cap before BC released, I think I was around level 55, but I honestly don’t ever remember shards being an issue, especially while leveling.
---
The epic mount quest was also a blast, even though i think I got carried by some 70s by the time I got around to doing it.  Would likely be even more fun with a group of 60s.  
---
I’m the opposite of you and will probably be rolling a warrior to start, raided with one all from Wrath through WoD, excited to see how different Vanilla prot warrior is.
---
So if you're in a group with a hunter who has 7/8 beast stalker and the belt drops, the last piece he needs for his 8/8 bonus you think the entire group should roll need to make 15-20g instead of letting the hunter have his 8 piece?
---
Ok enough shitposting guys, if you want an actual answer just look at WS vs WP arena games in TBC. In short WP needs to tunnel the shaman 24/7 unless he or his pally don't want to be 1shot by Chain Lightning+Windfury. Shaman team will lose the mana war so the only reliable way to win is to cc one person and burst the other
---
I understood that, but what’s the difference to any other item that drops then? All items can be sold, other stuff bought and hence be more useful to them than the original item would be for me. Why do we have a need/greed system at all then? We obviously don’t need it.
---
I think he made the proper choice imo.  It was gonna go down hill fast for him past that point.
---
Honestly i disagree on both points. I appreciate dailies are things you want to do every day to optimize rep etc, but i feel like its only true for the start of a patch or the start of an expansion. For instance im still not exalted with tortollan, and my neck isnt 50 yet. Yes I dont raid currently due to my work, but I dont see any point. The catch up mechanic just negates all that if i need to get something later in the future. Gold isnt even an obstacle anymore. This expansion is the first i havent farmed once or even attempted to make gold, and the reason is because you can buy it. Obviously im doing my dailies atm to get ahead on my essences, but give it a few months and ill go back to solely logging in to do mythic+
---
Classic on the otherhand, will give me a reason to play the game again which is what im excited about. Gold is hard to come by, raid mats need a ton of gold to get anywhere. leveling take time and theres certainly no catchup mechanic at the beginning. So not logging in will certainly put you alot further behind in classic than retail.
---
I was wondering if any class in vanilla is a proc based one? I get bored of just committing to a single rotation every fight and have found proc classes are my favorite in retail, was wondering if anyone knows if any classes are proc based ones? 
---
(I played vanilla when I was 8 and can't remember)
---
They may add race/name/appearance changes. I don’t care as long as it keeps the servers running. 
---
Cash shop mounts have. 0.1% chance of making it into the game. I just don’t see it happening while Adham is around at least.
---
That’s a pretty low ratio.  That’s like 5-7.5% space in raids for a class played by 14% of players.
---
2-3 tanks, ~12 healers, the rest DPS. That's your raid comp. Just make it diverse and you'll have no problems.
---
delusional. i hope you have friends that will let them play with you cause pugs aren’t gonna take you
---
IDK why people like going to Westfall so early as a night elf.  There's not many good quests at that level and it's harder to level in than Darkshore.  It's far more convenient to level in Darkshore then go to Westfall when you're overpowered and breeze through it.
---
Thank You.
---
It's basically free now.
---
Horde scum, I see what you did
---
Been playing as Alliance proudly since day 1. Proudly killed a lot of Hordies in Pvp. Proudly continue to do so whenever I feel like resubing for a month on retail to kick some horde butt on Zandalar in War Mode. (Given the imbalance it's actually funnier to be on the side with fewer people. Makes hunting all the more thrilling ! Back in Classic my friends and I had transfered to a low Alliance pop server specifically to kick Horde butt.)  
---
That said ever since Warlords I've been contemplating this simple fact. I'm an over-achiever. I've done Loremasters on several characters because I love the game's lore.  
---
Yet. As I quest in Warlords Zone I simply realize that I've been ignoring HALF of it all for all that time.  
---
So what do I do ? I get bored in my garrison. And on a hunch I spend the Character boost token I had in store from the WoD purchase all the way back in 5.4 to create a Blood Elf Warlock at level 90.   
---
That character. My only horde character. Is a boosted one. And I played it like a few hours. Barely enough to reach 92 before realizing ...   
---
It's not that I don't care. I'm intrigued by their story, even if I'll never side with them "for real". But ... it feels like trying to pick up a story without reading the 22 books that lead it to this point. I love details in the lore. I knew in a "general" way how stuff unfolded in the Horde from the Alliance side. But I wanted details. I wanted to see links between Alliance quests and Horde quests. Which quests and which side were the consequence of which quest etc.   
---
But for some reason in my boredom I thought "Hey - play a class, race and faction you never played starting near max level !". Stupid ass idea.   
---
Yet I was intrigued. So ... I decided to try again in Legion. No a boosted character this time. But a level 1. Undead Hunter. Played the experience all the way through roughly near the ending of Hillsbrad after the pexing revamp in 7.3.5. Loved it. But it irked me as well.  
---
Back when Cataclysm launched, the first thing I did, was take my main character at the time and return to my starting zone to do all the quests again. I wanted to see what was going down. And more importantly if some quests acknowledged my past deeds (there are quests that specifically mention quests you have done in the past though there only a few of these - most of the time it's just a vague reference to something you likely had to do before getting your current quest. What comes to mind is the "Hero of Outland" welcome at the Howling Fjord when under the new leveling system - if you're in Northrend that means you likely skipped Outland.)  
---
And I loved it because every quest giver had evolved according to what had happened in their "vanilla" quests.   
---
But on my Forsaken Hunter I could only get the hints (the most obvious ones being the "Forsaken of Old that weren't as lucky as you are now" or Helcular in Hillsbrad).   
---
And I thought - man I really should have made Loremaster on Horde side at least once before Cataclysm to know what those stories where. I want to experience these, not read about it on some site.   
---
And later Classic WoW is announced - though I never dared to hope it would happen. And I knew.   
---
Time for a fresh start. On the Horde side ! I just have to convince myself to play on a PvP realm as Horde. I can't even consider not playing on a PvP realm. So I'll guess I'll have a Horde one on which I won't be very zealous - just covering my butt and eventually defending a hordie in need - but no hunt for me this time.   
---
And Alliance on another realm for sheer nostalgia. And Hunting Hordies actively.   
---
TL:DR : Turn coat and reroll Horde for the "first" time ever.

I only remember two shotting enemies in battlegrounds. Blizzard please let my backstab teleport me behind targets and instantly kill them. I need my highlight reel.

---
Personally I don't find shard farming that bad if you're proactive. I replenish my soulshards while cons Most people become pretty good at timing their shadowbolts so you're finishing with a shadow burn followed by a drain soul on most trash and replenishing whatever you lost. Progression kills can be a bit taxing, especially if there isn't trash to reclear.
---
PVP can be a bit shard expensive as it's much harder to replenish your shards while not casting a shadowbolt/searing pain for the killing blow. You'll be eating one on a pet every time you die, plus you have a smaller chance of getting one back when you shadowburn and aren't guaranteed a kill. On alliance side you can get soulshards from killing totems however.
---
Leveling warlock duo with a healer is incredible, especially with a druid or priest who can keep HOTs on you so you can keep lifetapping and never have to drink and you can get healed while moving. Your healer drinks while you pull, meaning your duo has 0 downtime.
---
The only major issue with warlock is until the ZG patch you'll have painful levels of +hit making you easily the worst DPS class. Once you get into AQ and Naxx you'll catch up on damage.
---
!
---
The fuck? That's literally a wholly in game achievement.
---
How do you get access to these physical maps? They are interesting to me...
---
Agreed. 100% shitpost. Why even make this abomination?
---
Everyone’s body is different. I played soccer my entire life and the minute I stop exercising it doesn’t matter what I do, I’ll gain weight. 
---
I agree about eating tho. Leave my food to get cold just to finish a raid.
---
Why doesn't the hunter buy it off the AH for 20g? For friends and guildies sure I might let them have BoEs for use, but randoms I wont trust with that... Everyone rolls need.
---
Odd, clearly a hunter weapon
---
ttps://wow.tools/maps/
---
When we did it the Paladins would be next in line after the NR Geared people started dropping think it was the mellee dps and then the hunters as the 1st and Second wave so  a paladin would be 3rd when i started getting hit i would bubble and that would give 10 seconds of soaking up the damage away from the rest of the raid.
---
Or y'know when people were selling that stuff on ebay \*eyeroll\*
---
Ikr, bloodvine is bis almost till naxx, kinda sux that it looks like shit though.xD
---
I plan on playing druid as a fun alt, crushing mobs, tanking dungeons or just gathering some herbs. It would be a shame if if the leveling will be as tedious as leveling a warrior.
---
I can't believe there isn't some sort of official documentation on the macro api (if there is one, sure isn't easy to find on google).
---
Because the amount of gold they sell for you can buy several BiS pieces. It's also such a huge amount of gold that you can invest it and potentially be set for the rest of the game. So yeah it's BiS, but the gold value of the item completely outweighs the value of its stats. 
---
Also, if I'm in a pug I don't know if a rogue or whatever will just need anyways while the others greed. 
---
If a Warden Staff drops (about 400-600g) and we have a feral tank then I would probably need on it and give it to him as an assurance that a rogue doesn't get it.
---
The game has been out for 15 years and while private servers are inaccurate, if you go for 100% optimal there isn't a lot of experimentation needed.
---
Obviously the perfect setup is different for each phase.
---
For MC, in the later phases you can even take more than one meme spec and still do it. 20 MC geared people can clear MC easily. Onyxia was killed by 3 people during Vanilla.
---
Yeah my guild has a comp we are aiming for, but we are aware that we will probably have to make do
---
Always remember, all specs are viable for their intended role (shadow for dps, not healing; prot for tanking, not dps; etc). It’s a matter how optimal.
---
Hunter perform just fine. They start off fairly strong with less gear but scale less than mages/warlocks. So in MC, it’s easier to gear enough to do competitive dps. However, by Naxx, you won’t be doing as much damage as them.
---
Ultimately, unless you are in some crazy world first racing guild, your class is less a detriment than you using your head. Be quick with the tranq shot, be good at cc’ing as necessary, etc and you’ll have proven to the guild your worth as a player and hunter.
---
it actually is the  **Frostwolf**  banner
---
yep. it needs a little cropping bc there's a weird white border around it, but yeah incredible background
---
Completely underrated!
---
I might print this out... I will need ink :)
---
that would be ebic
---
IMO, the fact no one at Blizzard seems to have ever seriously questioned the assumption of raiding as the Be All, End All has always been one of their biggest mistakes.
---
Which isn't to say I think there's necessarily anything wrong with raiding; I get that a lot of people enjoy it and I say more power to 'em. The problem is, starting in TBC and continuing to this day, Blizzard seems to have decided the only real issue with raiding is its accessibility. They don't seem to have ever considered the possibility a decent chunk of their player base simply aren't interested in the activity itself.
---
Ah, I thought it was 100g! Thanks for clearing that up!
---
oh yeah, forgot about the 30/25/20% drop chance on the gems!, Wyrmthalak had a 30% chance iirc, if you're running it with guildies you give them to a designated key holder, like your main tank preferably.
---
Yah, it's a very very short internal cooldown, like maybe a few milliseconds. I tested it on an offline private server (I recognize that doesn't make this %100 viable information) and created some weapons with ridiculously low attack speed. It was still able to proc twice in a row or more at extremely fast attack speed, but at the cap of attack speed I was not able to proc it twice in a row.
---
Am i the only one bothered by the fact that someone burned a debuff slot for rend
---
That's not Ironforge.
---
The optimal comp is whatever players your guild has online, the hardest part of classic raiding is getting 40 people
---
just have a good time and learn as you go along. being new you will probably have even more fun. dont try to research everything beforehand
---
Didnt fury only get strong once they revamped the talents in whatever patch (1.1.2)? I think they were average for most of vanilla. Classic is starting with the revamped talents off the bat however
---
I don’t get why a lot of people on this sub act like doing molten core is going to be hard. The hardest part of vanilla raiding was getting attuned/geared for the raid and then having 40 people show up. I’m sure there are groups out there that will end up clearing it with a bunch of ret paladins and feral druids. I know some people will want to min max but can we stop acting like we need some complex algorithm for vanilla raiding.
---
They’re very important. You take them so you know you can kick all the dps lower than them.
---
Are you drunk? Classic WoW is from an era of not caring about min-maxing. I'll be playing a hunter ... the class notorious for being leprous to any min-maxer. Again, how self-unaware are you? You seem hell-bent on zero-value posts while claiming my post didn't say anything. And now you seem really upset and easily triggered, yet you want me to chill out and just have fun.
---
Oh well. We're done here.
---
Oh. I guess that is true.
---
That depends on whether the DM lashers are nerfed like on private servers or not. If they are nerfed then I'd say jump runs are probably better if you have a miner and enchanter in the setup. If lashers are not nerfed then it's probably quite close and depends more on how fast you can do the runs and of course if there are gankers in DM they can slow down your solo grinding tremendously. 
---
Also the value of shards changes so that will also be a factor.
---
It is 100g.  50g to respec then 50g to respec back.
---
yep. you can not log in for a week, and then log on and grind for the same amount of time it would have taken to do 7 days' dailies.. this way is much more flexible and not telling you how you have to divide your time
---
Stop giving OP credit for this, he just took the original pic that's been around for years and made it blurry with paint or someshit.
---
I already did, until we can overcome the point I quoted I feel it's meaningless.  
---
If you want me to go further I can.  
---
"Vast majority" is an argument to the people, a logical fallacy. It has no place in verifying any claim.  
---
If you can't explain why BoE is different to BoE (Both result in gold) then it's also irrelevant.  
---
To say someone will use an AH item is not only an assumption but even if it were 100% true, that someone was not there for the drop. That may not matter to you, which causes as I said, an impasse.
---
Is that out of max level characters? Or does that count people who got to level 10 and never subbed beyond their free gametime?
---
There are mage aoe rotations based around "fishing" for clearcasting (no mana cost) procs.
---
SM/Ruin warlocks can toss corruption around while waiting for a nightfall proc (instant shadowbolt).
---
You spelled horse scum capital wrong *
---
It's still a thing on retail I believe. The guy on the second floor of the tailor shop in the Mage Quarter.
---
Classic is not a competition, just the top guilds in the world will have a race for something that has been done long ago anyway.
---
Also my guess is that the bigger half of classic players will be crap in the beginning, retail players coming in, people that havent played for over a decade and brand new players will have to learn how to play too

---
I'm just saying, beta capped at level 40 and people getting bored and sloughing off without Blizzard inviting new people to take their place isn't exactly very telling.
---
Am I misremembering the way honor works? Isn't there rank decay for PVP?
---
It's always been the standard. There's no way to be sure that a BoE won't just end up on the Auction House, so the most fair way to deal with the situation is for everyone to roll on it and just *expect* that it ends up there. If someone in the group would benefit, they can buy it off the person who won or from somebody else.
---
Perfectly viable.  As hunters quit in later raids they may not be replaced with other hunters. Progression guilds will run 2 to 4. Don't expect stacking like mages and warriors.
---
Its market manipulation. It is not allowed.
---
I definitely enjoy farming more when there's a goal like an epic mount or the next PvP rank. Farming for consumables gets old real quick though, especially when you're doing Naxx and you have AQ, BWL etc scheduled on other days.. it starts to fill up your time and loses its luster a bit.
---
Nah IF was way better
---
I plan on taking Tailoring + Skinning for some ez moneys. Save gear and @ 60 reroll skinning for enchanting and level from there.
---
Ah I love Freeport
---
I'm in the same boat. From what I've been learning, both make fantastic priests, but the Racials change the style significantly. Undead get Devouring Plague, which is a neat DoT but can be easily dispelled by Alliance Dwarves, Paladins, and Priests. It's expensive though, and pretty much means you'll need Inner Focus to cast it. WotF is also fantastic, as is Cannibalism.
---
Troll on the other hand get Shadowguard, Hex of Weakness, and Beserking. Shadowguard is basically a Lightning Shield, it can also proc Blackout! So even if you're a healer in PvP, putting 5 points into the talent can make dealing with you a pain. Hex of Weakness reduces healing by 20%, it unfortunately doesn't stack with Mortal Strike though, but still, pretty handy! Beserking also allows you to quickly spam out big heals, or dish out fast mana burns.
---
Overall, both are fantastic for PvP, but Trolls are considered better for PvE. To be honest, the only thing Undead have over Troll Priests is style. Trolls be jammin' mon, but can't compare to Undead animations and how damn good they look in Cloth.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lqcMMmT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lqcMMmT.jpg) , this is the original picture btw, op just made it blurrier and claimed credit.

I don't think its worth for me to invest many hours into learning a new operating system just so I can play Classic.
---
Smash with a dildo then, bro!
---
Cool. I think it might be interesting for one of these to be a super high zone, say all the mobs are 63+, maybe many of them elite, could be kind of like jintha'lor
---
I played priest, mage, paladin.  Mage is most boring.  Hour of water prep+1button spamming &lt;&lt; whack a mole with flash of light and cleanse.
---
I'd just pick the lock and then leave it open/not trade until they put some tip money in
---
&gt; Besides, once the Honor system comes out, most people will want to maintain Rank 3 and DKs will destroy your rank in a matter of hours.
---
Players never have been a source of dishonorable kills. You can always kill any player without hurting your honor score. As long as their level vs yours is not grey, they grant honor. If their level is grey it doesn't do anything. 
---
You get dishonorable kills by killing some faction npcs that are specifically flagged for it.
---
Not much if any new optimization is going to come out.
---
That said *plenty* of scuffed comps are going to clear content easily, so you'll see plenty of odd stuff in PUGs.
---
Because I'm a spammer, obviously.
---
I dont remember the exact stats posted by blizzard, but only about 10% of all players (player = unique account, including people that got to level 10 yes) got to level 60. Of them only around 1% (yes, 1% of 10%) set foot in Naxx. Only 10XX people killed KT before BC launch. Obviously more people tried MC/BWL, but its safe to say it was far from the majority of people.
---
Fuck my class harder daddy
---
I agree, but I was more implying solo runs. 
---
Orb reserve runs are lucrative once you have gear, not while you're getting gear.
---
ROFL no...
---
I'm laughing at the idea of hardcore purist beta players playing the level capped beta years after the actual game has been released.  And then in 10 years there will be a Classic WoW Beta reboot called Classic WoW Classic Beta and all the beta bugs will be intact #nochangesever
---
Oh, pvp you need to log in for, and farm your ass off. Same wheb you need to do some rep farm or so. But, you dont have to do it this week. Well, unless you are going for that rank..
---
It's funny I'm gonna do the opposite. Ally since day one, never played horde up to now - will switch on Classic and I am facing the same questions XD  
---
Well, comrade Turncoat, I salute you. May you prosper with ma bois in blue ;)

Ah i missed "good race" part. I can delete and you can delete and the dissected frog can come back to life. Though I imagine even Horde know of Stormwind ;D

and the OTHER weird thing is that only some schools can partially resist lol
---
So i mean this isn't really relevant to the topic at hand then right? Non max-level characters in retail don't have dallies either so it is presumed we're talking about max level content.

AN upgrade is an upgrade need on that for sure.

You are fucked basically.  You can't farm gold, except with professions, which is MUCH worse than just general farming when the game starts.   Then Dire Maul opens up, and the economy is totally fucked, because now the dps classes can farm insane amounts of gold.  Far more than you could ever dream of picking flowers.   This in turn causes inflation.
---
Stupid pvp min-max I do, people often counterspell by literally seeing your cast while targeting someone else.  Human female casting hand is in front and almost behind character,  Human male one hand is up one hand is by hip, dwarf female is both hand out near hips, dwarf male is almost contained like they are leaning over their spell.  IMO is the best pvp casting animation, as it is the most subtle.
---
Honestly these posts have made me feel like classic plus is the way to proceed moving forward
---
Sorry to be that guy but this video is fake.. Tosh.O had him on back in the day and he confessed to staging the video
---
Prot Paladins were not just worse than warriors (even non prot warriors) at tanking, they could not do their basic job, and the only PvP use they had was reckoning, which was not at all what they were supposed to be like. You were not intended to go 2 hander buzz saw as the protection spec. The raids required a taunt. Prot Paladins didn't have one. That alone made them incapable of doing it. It was a completely neglected spec outside of aoe grinding. There wasn't even any gear for it.
---
Warlocks and Hunters were required to ignore the main gimmick of their class in raids because using your pet was giving it a death sentence on most boss fights, and even when you did use it, it didn't get any stronger after you hit level 60. (not to mention debuff slots artificially kneecapping both of them)
---
Every hybrid but warriors were effectively pidgeon-holed into healing until the tail end when people cracked the code on feral dps (using a gnomer hammer and a level 40 helmet) and warlock damage got high enough to justify one shadow priest being brought for a debuff. For 95% of vanilla, if you were a hybrid and in a raid, you healed. Period.
---
Ret Paladins and Enhancement Shaman had extreme difficulty even getting gear that gave them the stats their spec required. Hunters had a whole host of abilities that their gear would never improve because it needed spell power.
---
I'm not saying vanilla had no advantages, but bare viability of each spec and the existence of gear for it would have been nice.
---
I would love to disappoint her for 2 minutes
---
Classic 6.8k health and a 5.5k mana pool warlock build

Yes I’m definitely the one upset lol

well no shit its fucking fake, dude had a whole web series of him doing stupid shit.
---
The Knights of the Nine was was such a dope Oblivion DLC. Hell, all the Oblivion DLC was great. Remember how much people laughed at horse armor? And now cosmetic items are huge in gaming. It was really ahead of its time.
---
Well it takes a bit of works to set up but it's well worth it.
---
Is there one of Stormwind?
---
All these zones make me realize how much coastline vanilla was missing. Wonderful as always.
---
It's a drawing from 10 years ago with a filter
---
The comment I referred to specifically mentions raiding. There are many dailies to be done before max level if you so desire. Also the % of active accounts below max level is extremely low compared to vanilla. How many active retail players are below max level? 20% maybe? In vanilla that figure was closer to 90%.
---
It's just a clever use of a service Blizzard themselves offer.
---
personally im going tailoring and herb while leveling then dropping herb for alchemy at max and any herbs i need im gonna get from my rogue alt
---
Also you lose bubble and bop functionally, while the carrier.  While not the best carriers they are basically the best escorts with freedom, , bosac, and cleanse
---
It's a drawing from 10 years ago with a filter, even cropped the artist's name out

show me when Aubrey has unironically said "rawr xD"
---
&gt; Onyxia was killed by 3 people during Vanilla.
---
Not quite. They did it after the pre-TBC patch. It was done by a group of 4 before the patch though.
---
yo, orcs can be mages in 2012
---
I get you. There’s a nice bit of darkshore to do before traveling to EK. I would do it before darkshore if I want to meet up with friends like OP.
---
In my experience on private servers Horde have a huge advantage in pug v pug in every BG, including AV. They skip the bridge and take the backdoor. 
---
In premade v premade Alliance has a huge advantage due to paladins being crazy good. 
---
Then again we won't have the old AV so it will be easier to get to the bosses, not sure how it will play out.
---
*Little better*
---
I'm saving this as my plan. Very well thought-out. J appreciate it!
---
Threat capped or they weren't using weapon skill.  Our warriors were competitive
---
hmm okay, thank you!
---
I might make a mage then!
---
Druids are fine main tanking almost every raid encounter. There are a couple of fights where Druids are flat out better than Warriors.
---
The chief issues for Feral tanks is the relative lack of good upgrades in raids prior to  AQ 40, the limitations on consumables, and the lack of big emergency cooldowns.
---
The chief advantage for Feral is the higher threat ceiling,  particularly in earlier raids, and better mobility. 
---
Warriors are never a bad choice for main tank, but that doesn't mean they are always the best, or that no other choice is viable. 
---
But Paladin definitely needs help for tanking. Even just a mana regen mechanic from healing received would be amazing for making them not awful. Even with that,  there are just so many issues to address for them to be a genuinely good choice as a tank. One of the few truly broken talent specs in the game.
---
One of the biggest reasons I would hate them to continue to TBC I hate dailies with a passion.
---
Wait I'm having trouble with this. In this scenario, is the item you post for 20g worth less than 20g usually?
---
&gt; Also by the end of TBC basically everything interesting about Blood Elves had been resolved and they were much more regular nice-guy elves instead of the arseholes hiding their increasing desperation behind a veneer of civilization they started out.
---
Y'know, if Blizz had actually followed through on this I might have eventually learned not to hate them (the blood elves) as much.
---
I mean, I'd still hate them on a purely superficial fantasy racist level simply because they're elves and I am, as stated, a fantasy racist. I might have found some small degree of redeeming virtue in them, however, if they'd actually been forced to come to grips not only with what had been done to them but what they had done in response, and to forge a new way forward in a redemptive arc, just as the orcs had done before them.
---
Instead we got the magical cosmic wind chimes equivalent of a wizard waving his hands around and poofing everything better.

Which part of the Undercity is this?

I didn't either because she wasn't too famous yet then. When i saw her in other stuff i just remembered her as the retard hot wow commercial girl.
---
I played a druid and remember lowering my healing a bit to use a nice set of NR gear (Staff of Rampant Growth, T2 chest, Drake Tooth Necklace, Recomposed Boots, and a few others that I can't remember). I found that when she rages at 30% the longer I can stay alive to HoT up and burst heal the raid the better. I was confused for a min though, that's not something that was necessary just something I did. It's been a long time.

That "Frostwolf Retreat" sounds a bit weird, to be honest. Having the Frostwolf clan there would certainly to expand on the lore a lot.
---
Overall hpaladin is best, especially so in large groups where healers are going to be the target and get zerged or CCd by good players.  
---
Druids are uniquely good in small scale wpvp because of their mobility and kiting against small numbers.  They lack dispel though, so they are not the best of supports, and their ability to kite breaks down the more people that are attacking them so if the pvp turns zergish they struggle more then paladin.
---
You should make an Imgur album or something with those screenshots. It's a very interesting discussion topic imo!
---
Yeah it's harder. If you actually think warrior is harder then you're a dumbass who doesn't know how to fucking play. Learn to hit your hamstring button and stop taking hits to the face in between your swing timers. But hey if you like taking big hits all over your face that's up to you, aint gonna judge.
---
It’s different. In retail I’m forced to log in every day for 2 hours. I can’t just spend 15 hours over the weekend because of the time gates. Classic WoW still cares that I play 15 hours a week, but it doesn’t care when I spend it.
---
Blizzard has had a native Mac client for years stick to what you know
---
The game and all the promos are designed around the idea of "fear of missing out", it applies to a vast amount of things outside of WoW, too
---
i wonder if for classic it could matter a little if they plan on doing 1.14 content instead of tbc (but let's be real, theyll probably take the easy route and simply do tbc)
---
&gt;Lots of angry people after that, but that's why I had used a bank alt for it
---
what about the &lt;Made by Main&gt; on the actual item?
---
No but it’s a way to move an item quickly. Someone buys it thinking they will make a quick profit by selling it to your alt who is in trade chat spamming WTB item 30g.
---
You don’t then actually buy said item when unfortunate stranger messages you saying they have one for sale.
---
That’s why it’s a scam.
---
That's okay dude, she probably hates you too
---
Just.. ugh.
---
It runs good enough on a fairly modern machine. But 2012 is getting kind of old. You would probably have to keep your settings pretty low. Especially if you can’t upgrade that ram.
---
You can do the AQ chain for the epic gear after the gates open, its much easier when you can get the rep from the raids and not from farming 10000 bugs.
---
Tunnel-visioning only onto PvE and pretending like specs like *FERAL* were bad in PvP is exactly the sort of shit that lead Blizzard to the path they're on in retail. Further, tunnel-visioning *only on raiding* is exactly why the modern game is "get to cap and then you're allowed to play the game". I do think some specs could have used reworks to give them better niches, but there is nothing inherently wrong with the things you pointed out. So some classes are better than others, or some classes can't fill certain roles. Yes. That will always be the case. *That will always be the case*. The only problem I see is that Blizzard telegraphed this poorly and people got duped into specs that weren't good at the thing they wanted it to be good at.
---
If the dude manages to consistently get out without dying, why do you care if he does risky bullshit?
---
You're brave.
---
&gt; They skip the bridge and take the backdoor.
---
And in more modern clients, this jump skip has been fixed. Since we are playing on the legion client, it won't exist.
---
And the only reason why horde stood a chance in AV, was because of being able to skip the bridge which was a deathtrap.
---
So time will tell how things play out, once we have many more players playing, the zerg strat will probably resurface once we have 60's who are able to just zerg relief hut, kill the marshals one by one, and kill the final boss.
---
What's wrong with the wow token though? It doesn't hurt the economy,
---
you dont understand how the economy in a mmo works then
---
If you’re thinking of playing a hybrid dps, you’ll have an easier time getting in a guild group than pugs.
---
There is /r/ClassicWowGoblins set up but it's pretty dead tbh. Would love to see a good classic economy discussion some time
---
 I have found mistake - "Stranglethorn Valley" - [Stranglethorn Vale](https://www.wowhead.com/stranglethorn-vale)
---
As a DPS warrior I will be tanking dungeons and roll need on both dps and tank gear, but I will take 1 melee dps and 2 caster dps so everyone has a decent chance of getting the items, instead of taking 3 casters like some people.
---
I did this with my younger brother and I felt vaguely bad about it, but he had a blast killing and skinning gorillas or whatever.
---
They are the best in pre-bis on Horde 100%. Maybe they get beat out by Rogues on Alliance?
---
Why do you equate "min-maxers" with "assholes" and "great people" with "not min-maxers". They're not exclusive.
---
yeh just gotta buy all the expansions and pay monthly subscriptions until you reach that point, and then continue to farm retail while you're playing classic.
---
Yes, "need if need" should only apply to BoP.
---
When did Ironforge look like that?
---
It's both. And really bad for both server economies.
---
but you never had to farm for raid consumables, the raids were never balanced around mixmaxing to beat. sure they were very nice to have, but you didnt even need all 40 players for raids, much less having every single one buffed to the gills every night
---
I’m actually upgrading it to 16 GBs next week so that should be fine.
---
Can definitly agree on that. The forums make it seem way more relevant than it actually is for most players.
---
Keep in mind that a lot of hunters will be farm-alts that just grind gold.
---
BoE = everyone needs on it, period, end of story. 
---
Anything else makes things weird/complicated/people get butthurt
---
So is layering, but that gets a pass
---
I came in expecting to see a painting of Thunder Bluff.
---
Lots of hunters never raid. In Vanilla the guilds I was part of always tons of hunters but never more than 4 or 5 showed up for a raid.
---
Hmmmm...That doesn’t look like Ironforge! /s
---
I played for years for wowprogress ranks. Front page was all that mattered, if that meant I farm the fucking toy box item that spawns critters so I can Mind Blast them between pulls to charge Shadow Orbs...thats what i did. 
---
When there were no limitations on consumables: I had them all.
---
Was I a massive fan of spending equal amounts of time farming for BC and Vanilla raids as I did inside them? Not entirely, but it was the way you consumed the content, it was balanced around it. Especially at the bleeding edge before strategies permeated and raids geared up. And there wasnt an alternative, if I wanted to progression raid: I farmed consumes. By Wrath It also meant having a raid ready alt. By WoD we were expected to have 2. 
---
Ill raid classic just as hardcore as I did at my height of this game. I like raiding. 
---
Its the same as playing sports. No one likes swim practice 2 a days waking up at 4:30am for 5am practice, freezing your nuts off to then come back in the afternoon after school to stare at the black line again for 3 hours. But meets are fun. Competing is fun. Racing is fun. Beating other people is fun. 
---
But come on. Farming consumes sucks. Id much rather spend every moment farming inside a raid grinding my face on even harder bosses. If I am going to spend 30 hours a week raiding and/or farming combined, Id rather spend 25 raiding and 5 farming vs 15 of each. (junk hours to illustrate the point)
---
Lol you keep thinking that buddy.
---
It’s worth a shot then. From my testing it’s more resource intensive than private servers (using better graphics on the classic client) but easier to run than retail.
---
I agree, I think MC will be a cake walk for a full raid of 60s semi knowing what they are doing. The best guilds will probably down MC with 250-30 60s and then some 56+s trying to get World/Server firsts.
---
You made this? I made this
---
As much as I love classic not sure I agree with this. In fact, I specifically remember trying the honor grind and my parents decided to have us go on vacation for a week. I was upset that I missed an entire week of PVP due to the honor decay,  and had to spent the entire next week making up for the lost week.
---
Except for raid night. Then you're obligated.
---
You're right, ugh. How dare I have a point that makes sense that you can't answer without being facetious.
---
Please delete these karma leeching post!
---
Go play retail then, it's a great place for like-minded folks who don't understand what inflation is.
---
I remember playing the demo for butcher bay (I want to say that the demo disk came with the chronicles of riddick movie that had come out the same year) and really enjoying it, but being unable to find it in stores.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Green spell damage gear is in the beta so I'd assume it will be available from launch.
---
3 times you should judge sotc:
---
If the target will take a substantial amount of time to kill, like &gt;30sec.  The issue is anything taking that long to kill, judgement of wisdom or light will probably outperform jotc especially so if you are grouped with other players.  
---
If the target needs to burst to be killed.  AKA a mob that constantly heals so you need to kill him in a single hoj or while he casting.  Very niche.
---
If there is more then one ret paladin, one of you should be judging sotc for sure on anything that will live &gt;10sec.
---
Can’t wait to fight tooth and nail against guildies for that sweet sweet Neltharian’s Tear
---
Apparently greens "of Holy Wrath" currently can drop on Beta, and they weren't even in the game until TBC, so at the moment I don't think there can be a satisfactory answer to your question.
---
Correct.
---
durotar was too hot
---
I don't really know, I guess they didn't put two and two together. All the hate mail went straight to my bank character, never to my blacksmither. I guess it's hard to hold the smith accountable, easier to hold the seller accountable?
---
Did he check his pockets?
---
And then if they show up with Warchiefs Blessing too...phew
---
Yes, clearly a sound business decision. Potentially taking a team off of a more successful product and putting them on the less successful product and putting the less successful team in charge of the more successful product.
---
You ate the bait, dude.
---
Where does OP ever say that they made this? For all we know they could've just found it, liked it, and wanted to share it?
---
*laughs in orcish*
---
Threat is the hard part. A decent warlock will keep about two shadowbolt crits' worth of threat below the tank which means he'll usually stand around, doing nothing. A good warlock however stays even with the tank, even pushing above by abusing the 30% aggro margin. They will also know when to dps and when to "save threat". I'm bad at explaining but essentially you view threat as a resource, so if you have your trinket about to be off CD you can do less dps before so you can more safely unload with trinket + PI or whatever. This also goes for boss length. Ideally you want to end the fight with very little mana and very close to aggro limit. For the last burst you can ask for a Blessing of Protection or Limited Invulnerability Potions to keep you from pulling aggro. Also things like getting hit by wing buffets, switching pets for less threat or more dps etc. 
---
Good control of threat is what really separates a good warlock from a decent one. It takes a long time to learn though and it's dependent on you being able to read the tank, which takes experience.
---
Shamans were worse I think.  I think they couldn't regen in combat even if they weren't casting :(
---
ah ok, my mistake then, it looked different somehow
---
Agree with you, it's situational to each item and each group. If it's a Black Duskwood Staff and an upgrade, they can have it for sure, but if it's an Assassin's Blade, everyone should Need.
---
Also I like to offer the item's sell price if I'm gonna use it and it's a 2man party
---
At least layering is justifiable for the over all game experience to some extent
---
I went through that exact type of pros/cons list in my head, but i somehow forgot about shadowgard entirely. 
---
I was leaning towards undead for the PVP use later on (phases 2+ with BGs) as WOTF used to feel invaluable, but i definitely lean more towards a PVE focus so it looks like troll will be the pick.
---
Good point. Still gross
---
I can see this meme taking off here.
---
lock is fun in pvp, just remember that its your enemies who are mobile--not you (like a mage) and your goal is to outlast them with your rot, not hit them with DD from 100 to dead (like a mage). 
---
fear, coil, seduce, exhaustion, tongues all that keeps the enemy from hurting you. 
---
Your dots and searing pain damage him.
---
Your defensives help sustain you and keep you alive.
---
You're blaming players farming gold for a fundamental design flaw of not having good high-end gold sinks. This is a systemic problem, not a people problem.
---
Only one PvP server? I was hoping for two...
---
As a crafter I don't really expect people to tip me for stuff if they have mats, but it's a nice surprise. If it's something I'm making with mats I'll just ask for a price up front.
---
I always tip because even if I provide the mats they spent the time and money to level up the tradeskill. I kinda just eyeball it but I've never had anyone complain about a tip being too small or anything.
---
&gt; Shadow priest in vanilla isnt really a thing
---
It's definitely a thing. Shadow weaving healer is relatively rare and only happens in the hardest of min max guilds.
---
&gt; its worth to give you loot over any other caster when it comes to damage. 
---
I assume you meant not worth?
---
Shadowpriest gear and Warlock/Mage gear has very little overlap as shadowpriests want flat spell power with mp5 over crit and hit.
---
Can you show me where they break down the revenue by game?
---
Because I cant find it, so you actually cannot infer anything from the quarterly earning statements unless you can show the breakdown.
---
They stopped reporting on WoW specific data when
---
a) they had more games out, and ones selling better than WoW
---
b) WoW had declined from 10 million subs to 5.5 by 2015 so they didn't want this extra bad news snipped out of every quarterly report. 2015 was the last time they gave an official number.
---
The sub number that was leaked in October was 1.7 million
---
it could definitely be down to 1 million by now
---
Idk I am an udercity kind of guy
---
Mained a resto druid in BC, resto shaman &amp; druid in WotLK, and disc Priest in Cata. I like to raid heal as opposed to tank healing, also like some mobility/instant casts.
---
I like shaman for the chain heal, one of the only real aoe heals in vanilla, but not many instant cast heals. Priest has some party healing, shields, and HoTs, but I prefer the nature aesthetic a bit more than the holy one, also aoe heals are locked to your group. Druid has rejuv but is much more reliant on healing touch and no normal rez for dungeons. Paladin is probably too tank healy and ret/prot are a little slow...
---
I guess mostly between shaman &amp; priest, ele and shadow also seem fun for pvp.
---
Just because my raid leader will cut off my fingers if I don't show up doesn't mean I'm obligated to log in!
---
&gt; social hierarchy that is visual in nature

Okay, Stacey.

---
Warlock is the easiest to level, and scales incredibly well with gear in PvP compared to other classes. Definitely a safe bet. Alliance Warlocks are exceptionally rare in PvP though due to Will of the Forsaken. They also die easily to Rogues. Very rare though, and always in high demand for raids.
---
Mages are decent to level, and possess a high skill cap in PvP. Even more so than Warlocks. Warlocks are tough, and deal the slow death. Mages are all about that burst, and in PvP burst is king. They are however very popular, but also in incredibly high demand. Making money is much easier too!
---
Rogues are a bitch to level. Like Warriors, they rely on gear. You have the advantage of stealth though, so you can pick you fights more carefully. PvP wise they're amazing. Chain stunlock is a death sentence for anyone in cloth; just be careful of Warriors, Hunters, and Orcs. They're usually in high demand for raids, being one of the best melee dps around.
---
Personally, I'd go Warlock for a first character. They're easy peasy, and you'll have a blast all the way up to 60.
---
I've heard the argument that both cat and bear are viable just that it takes 2xs the work of other dps and tank classes.. This is what is turning me off from druid tanking.
---
Le sigh, going to be rough being a hunter in Classic. Shit hasn't released yet and everyone hates me already lol.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
MTG does deliberately use pretty generic names for lands so you'd be hard pressed to actively avoid them, I was just wondering if it was a deliberate nod to the card- which does contain artwork appropriate for an area like this.
---
We had DS, BoP and BoF at 29.  There was no mortal strike or wound poison though so I definitely hear what you're saying about getting enough +heal.  Probably why I would go dwarf, rogue gets on you then pop stoneform and laugh while you wait for your peel.
---
Agreed. Give the boys in blue the playable high elves in the standard high fantasy setting they've always wanted - and give the Horde the Broken.
---
No, the remnants of a genocided people joining the faction led by the very race who nearly wiped them out doesn't make any more sense than a bunch of unapologetic, magic-addicted proto-fascists joining the Horde did, at least on its face, but there are ways to make it work. Moreover, the Broken at least fit the aesthetic of the Horde. The blood elves were literally only added to give them a "pretty" race.
---
Good guilds will try to keep a fairly steady raid comp so that you are gearing the same players. Most of the changes between comps is how heavy melee or caster focused they are. A guild that strives to dominate early game will for example have a ridiculessly heavy melee comp with idealy 1 warlock 1 mage, obviously gearing that is outragerous.
---
Funny PuGs have been taking me for years. I get into plenty of premades throughout the years as well.
---
I'll earn my spots in Classic just like I did in Vanilla onwards.
---
Not downvoting you for that, in some ways it does create a feeling like you "SHOULD" log in, but after this many years, I don't feel that way. Yes it's like $0.50 a day or whatnot, it's still a drop in the bucket. I can skip a few days, and make up my playtime on the weekends or when I have time to log in. It's like paying the game off over time.
---
Every few months you get a "free" DLC! (Major patch) All while you are paying the same amount.
---
You could probably make some good G making Glacial gear for a lot of people if their guildies aren’t around to make it for them
---
yikes
---
Also, there is no tram in AB
---
By 2-4 seconds, depending on RNG.
---
Inversely your goals are obtainable (mostly) without arbitrary time constraints. The exceptions being weekly lockouts on raid instances and transmute cooldowns. But otherwise whatever you are aiming for you can play until you get it. Want exalted status with Timbermaw? Murder bears for 72 hours straight, and don't skip a beat on your way there. 
---
The only downside to Classic WoW when it comes to getting what you want (gear wise) is that you're at the mercy of RNG and what items drop. It feels bad to kill Onyxia and then disenchant the guild's 8th Helm of Wrath meanwhile your guild only has a single Judgement Crown to its name. I definitely see why TBC started using token systems so no raid is a wasted raid loot-wise.
---
But yeah Classic WoW allows you to basically play as much or as little as you want and there's no lost opportunity cost. Didn't log in to do your dailies? That's reputation progress you lost and can't get back, and a whole extra day it's going to take you to earn that vendor reward for exalted status. You can't get on tomorrow and play twice as much to make up for the lost time, like you can do for many activities in Classic WoW.
---
while that wasn't an intentional reference, the forsaken town i put in Northern Lordaeron called ash hollow was a reference to dark souls
---
I don’t know what you’re talking about, raiding was the highlight of my week.
---
Hardcore raiders will have the exact comp they want for every raid more or less.
---
For progression guilds or casual guilds, you just take the 40 best players you can get. Sometimes that means maybe you're taking an extra Hunter or two because there the only PUGs that want an invite and your normal guildies are offline.
---
tbh, i really like the change on live to where gear is meaningless (nearly). 
---
Raid gear is objectively better, but supped up 5 man gear isnt bad and can get you in the door and killing bosses.
---
Nearly everything in mythic raiding comes down to skill not ilvl--thats a good thing. 
---
For years casuals complained that hardcore raiders werent better players--they just had more time. Turns out they are better players, and they commit more time. Cause when you normalize gear (or nearly do) and casuals still cant kill mythic bosses...well, it really makes you think...
---
And again, if youve stayed on the progression train this entire time, you get upgrades from the right sources at the right times always. Its casuals who are caught in the meat grinder of titanforging emissaries and m+ drops who experience all this negative feedback from the game systems.
---
&gt; Dead people dont do any dps.
---
Is what a raid leader who was jealous of my skills and is trying to trip me up into doing shit dps so he can justify kicking me from my adoring raidmates would say!
---
Woah Woah, where am I throwing a fit? I literally looked up discord and then downloaded it after this conversation. I don't see anywhere I'm bashing discord or anything of the sort.
---
I'm just being defensive because of the Ad Hominem attacks and shade getting thrown my way because I wasn't up to date with modern gaming culture. As if I'm lesser of a person because I never heard of Discord before.
---
That's not quite the same. You can do your farming by playing a little every day, or by having a marathon session - that applies to both rep grinds and money/consumables.
---
In vanilla, if you "miss" a day of farming, you can play a little more the next day or in the weekend. If you miss a day in retail, then the day you achieve exalted is pushed back by a day.
---
hope you don't like first aid lmao
---
They will rush and greenlight TBC and WOTLK servers....
---
Why? Because those will keep the money train going for one... But second: Those expansions are where the increased monetization efforts went live. So theyll be able to start selling name changes/server changes/race changes and whatever else. And guess what? You won't be able to claim its not Blizzlike if those services were offered in those expansions.
---
Now that means there wont be wow tokens or anything, but server xfers, name changes and the like are plenty profitable enough on top of getting those delicious classic subs that you otherwise wouldn't.
---
IMO they should go to him.  Everyone's gonna have to make the cross continent journey at some point.
---
If you have a schedule that makes you reliable (able to show up to every raid) I don't think it will be hard to find a spot as a shadow. My private server guild has had a hard time getting our shadow spot filled long term because you really only want one on your roster giving you no flexibility if that person misses a raid.
---
Profession services aren't worth much to guilds because most valuable drops are going to come from raids anyway.
---
That is still Vanilla, kind of. Vanilla ended with TBC launch, but the point is you don't exactly need a full raid to clear the early raids.
---
It looks like just a wall to me.
---
Nods to other franchises are a staple of Warcraft worldbuilding, so this is of course perfectly fine. :) 
---
One of the first I noticed (back in vanilla no less!) was the Horde town in the Arathi Highlands, Hammerfall. Named after one of my favorite bands.
---
Horde cities are mud huts and they walk around with no shoes
---
There is slow honor decay, if you are pushing high rankings, you're logging in every single day and farming for 6-12 hours a day (minimum) depending on the rank you are pushing, and where you are in the ranks.
---
Higher your rank, higher your bracket, and therefore higher amount of honor you need per week.
---
When I was pushing on live way back when, and on a low-pop server, I was farming 4-6 hours a day during the week, 16-20 hours on weekends. I made it to rank 13, was about a week away from 14..... honor rank was removed. (RIP)
---
I would like to witness such an epic event please.
---
Idk man, naxx pretty much required extreme consumable use. Especially early on.
---
That was a weird picture of the Stormwind gates.
---
Awesome addon, but what's up with the weird TTS commentary? Maybe being too anxious to use a microphone is a good sign you're not meant to be a comedian.
---
He should join a metal Band.
---
Very similar to the way mobile games work. 
---
Log in, click the buttons to get the things, finish x amount of main objectives, log off. 
---
Once your daily rewards are all burnt up, the incentive that drove you to log on again is gone. You have the option of continuing to play for fun, but now without the rewards, which will feel useless to most.
---
Remove the dalies and it becomes, "Here's the world. Do what you want, idgaf." You'll find yourself making your own plans, getting creative or even just wandering about. But that's through your own choice, which adds to the immersion.
---
Vanilla WoW never railroaded me into events, it just let me know they were happening. I had the choice to go to them or ignore them, at almost no harm to my gameplay experience.
---
Retail does this whole 'in your face thing', hands you a portal to the event and says "IT'S TIME FOR THIS NOW. DO IT."
---
Cool, I'll read this again in the morning.
---
enchanting and tailor
---
Lowest in the damages as pets don't scale well.
---
are there really that many boe BIS items for other classes? 100% of my BiS gear was BoP when I played a Hunter, gold couldn't get me a single BiS piece that I can think of off the top of my head.
---
You can get gold from anywhere, but those gloves in particular are realllly damn rare, and SUPER good for a long time (aka C'Thun). I would pass and let the warrior use them happily.
---
I dunno i guess it's just a different mind set. When I was leveling originally a Precisely Calibrated Boomstick dropped in Maraudon and my whole group passed on it because I was a hunter, they encouraged me to take it and even refused gold when i tried to give them some for their generosity.
---
When I play I want to help the whole faction get stronger, i let that warrior take those gloves and theres another bad ass geared warrior kicking around org looking for groups. The better / stronger the other members of your faction are the better / easier pugs, instances raids etc are going to go for everyone.
---
I dunno I guess I dont see gold being all that special that I need to take something that will literally be BiS for someone for almost the entirety of the game
---
Not Vanilla.
---
Native Classic client?

TLDR:  If you have average or above melee orientated gear at 60, you should never SoR with a deep ret spec.    
---
Assumptions:  10% crit(so super low), character tab dps of 107.21(blue gear at 60 from a private server), not counting sanctity, 2h spec, or vengeance

SoR is between 19 and 17 dps with a 2h at 60, and no imp SoR or spell power.  So you need a really fast weapon basically only 1h for sor to be better dps, except soc can proc vengeance and joc gets x2 crit modifier, and x2 modifer on stuns.  So really there is no point at which if you are deep ret to not use SoC.  
---
This changes a bit if you have bad gear, since SoC is scaling off of your melee damage and SoR is not.  Equally if you have high spell power the gap between the two spell changes such that SoR begins to look viable, but if you are specced to vengeance SoC is always better.
---
It goes beyond a general dislike. It's a deep hate for a terrible company. Great business model, but atrocious customer service, product quality and innovation in the past few years.

I bought an iPad for my mother, she opened it up and could barely get through the initial set-up before she decided she didn't like it. It wasn't returnable and we weren't even able to resell the iPad to anyone because it's locked to my mother's email that she created specifically for Apple.
---
3 Apple stores in a 200km radius couldn't unlock it for her and refused a refund even with a receipt. The $500 iPad is a brick sitting in her closet now.
---
That's just my own experience, I've heard worse stories.
---
Unlikely
---
It’s the same client as retail are you dumb or trolling?
---
But what was in the mailbox?
---
&gt; So not logging in will certainly put you alot further behind in classic than retail.
---
I am going to disagree, while gold is harder to come by, raiding high end in classic is a MASSIVE time sink, much more than modern WoW. It's not just consumables, it's also resist gear. But this is mainly for AQ+, as MC typically if you have greater fire protection potions, a handful of mana/health potions you should be good for the night. (Unless you're a tank or really trying to compete for top DPS) as most of the early raids are all about execution of simple mechanics, and gearchecks. (Don't be in full greens as a tank on rag for example)
---
But if you are doing competitive raiding in modern WoW, as in Mythic raiding (which I equate out to AQ40/Naxx raiding in classic in terms of timesink) you are commiting many hours a day to grind your Heart of Azeroth, consumables, vantus runes, etc etc.
---
No, having access to 41 point talents and TBC spells is not Vanilla.
---
We many not have been able to go through the Dark Portal until January 16, 2007, but the TBC era began on December 5, 2006.
---
Viable, but probably not as good as Warrior/Paladin or Warrior/Shaman due to superior damage buffs/debuffs and equally good healing.
---
So far as I know hotkeynet is allowed, making it relatively easy to loot at the same time.
---
Just never played on Mac as majority of games are not designed with them in mind is all.  Why so volatile?
---
Less than 2 months until release, beta cap is 40 and most of the people invited to beta are playing new bfa patch. Nothing approaching endgame has been tested yet and it could be weeks before it is, let alone fixed.
---
Flawless strategy, Blizzard.
---
We stood by the ony/nef heads to be honest. It was our gathering point. Was fun times.
---
8.2 saved wow and killed classic
---
So then stop talking out of your ass.
---
For the alliance
---
Compelled because you don't want to fall behind in ilevel/heart of azeroth level/dailys/wq's
---
Everyone who is commenting that they both should have rolled need are greedy as hell. If the player is going to equip it right after the roll then there is no monetary gain for that player compared to the other, he just got an upgrade that he deserved.. Hate players who try to justify their rolls due to the item being BoE.
---
I really wish you found some other use of this past week than spewing your ignorance all up and down this thread.
---
Bloodvine comes out with ZG in phase 4.
---
You can replace it without losing stats depending how much gear you get, somewhere in AQ which is phase 5.
---
what is the maximum mails you can send to a bank? (where the bank does not check them)
---
Great tool, I would love it if you had a summary of the stats that the bis set gives you
---
North - what do you think about Mage/Paladin duo in pvp?
---
How can you be a gamer and this much of a victim? Boomeritis.
---
Madman. Aren't we allowed to have a single bare, sheer cliff-ed coast?
---
Ahh yes you have played a ton of classic wow while raiding. Molten core requires a handful of people who know what they are doing, and a bunch of people who are basically cannon fodder. (Literally) Consumables aren't really used prior to RAG. (Even then, if you are popping a fire protection potion, groovy)
---
BWL requires mostly just healing/mana potions, as some of the fights are LONG when you first start out. As time goes on, this falls off.
---
AQ is where consumables start to really be required.
---
Only when I was raiding AQ and Naxx 4 nights a week, was I needing to farm daily. Prior, I was just pvping and screwing around mostly.
---
Why would Activision not have that data?
---
Blizzard will have metrics about what game subscribers are playing, how many hours, on which days and many more details... The subscription plan for customers is completely unrelated to that.
---
Thanks for the reply. So that is quite far off. Sounds like not getting tailoring right away is the right choice then.
---
So basically what youre saying is Hunters are the best with no downside got it picking hunter
---
No sense in rushing to 60 if PvP is what you're after. Kills mean nothing during Phase 1. Just sit back and enjoy it, take it all in.
---
Part of the reason why I hope Phase 1 lasts until January.
---
Him saying it's a painting implies that it was an original post made either by him or someone he knew.
---
not if I have anything to say about it
---
No, first you cap hit and then come the others.
---
But what about buffed items ?
---
I wouldn't touch BFA if it was free and even if who cares? Its not like there is any reason for you to keep up doing the useless stuff. 
---
I did that crap in Legion. Because I only raided in PUGs (to get my Sets) I always had to keep ahead of the pack, to get easy Invites. That was kinda terrible.
---
second nose is BiS, true WoW player
---
What if it's a couple hundred screenshots in?
---
But that isnt stormwind wtf.
---
I tested the stress tests and a 2013 MacBook Air (boot camp windows 10) holds 60 FPS on mostly medium settings. Turn shadows and anti-aliasing low/off. 
---
Even though it’s a legion based client the assets are still classic and require low specs to run decently. I’m pretty convinced I could run classic on an Intel atom based tablet and maintain a solid 30fps.
---
Hunters do good damage in MC/Ony Phase 1, top 10 dmg done in raid easy.  They start to drop off BWL/ZG and Continue to lag behind AQ/Naxx.  That being said, they are more than fine DPS wise, I think the only patch you 'might' have a hard time finding raid is Naxx but by then you should have secured your raid spot and you will be brought for Utility not damage.  The best hunter in the group will likely be better than the worst Mage/Lock/Rogue/War until AQ/Naxx  
---
Also the raids are really easy until AQ and Naxx so dont worry about it
---
Exactly. Some classes became literal gods for a few weeks before TBC.
---
And now you're moving the goalposts, arguing just to argue. Blocked.
---
Need is need man
---
The Bloodvine set becomes available at Phase 4, when Zul'Gurub and the Zandalar Tribe reputation releases. This is probably ~8 months into the game (2 months each for Phase 1 and 2, 4 months for Phase 3).
---
There are three patterns. The boots require Friendly to learn, the leggings require Honored to learn, and the vest requires Revered to learn. You do not need to have these reputation thresholds to wear the set, just to create them.
---
If you have the set and are a tailor with 300 skill, you get an extra 2% spell crit.
---
For Warlocks, the Bloodvine set remains best-in-slot until Naxx during Phase 6, but only if you have the Tailoring bonus.
---
This is why I'll be the slowest person to 60, but fuck I'll be enjoying it every step of the way
---
Tauranope.
---
Seems so.
---
I'm not expecting rogues or mages to tank, but I am expecting protection specced paladins to be able ... not best at it, able... to tank a raid for a group of people that would humor you. Ret was ABLE to do its job, it was just suboptimal at it. Rolling a paladin for 60 levels expecting to be a front lines fighter because you were told in the class description you would be, only to get to 60 and finding out you were expected to cleanse and flash of light and never hit anyone with your weapon was a huge let down.
---
They were at least good at healing.
---
Whoever said feral was bad at pvp was crazy and hasn't played WSG or Alterac where you stealth past people to back cap with your rogue friends.
---
???? the game has plenty of gold sinks. The problem is you're introducing demand for gold from something *that is not in the game*. Adding more gold sinks won't solve that problem, as evidenced by retail.
---
I’m gonna vent a bit here. But it’s very frustrating seeing these posts when you clearly see them working very hard to make this a reality. 
---
They show you how much they care only to get a “I still don’t trust you” “I still hate you” “I still think you are a piece of shit” etc. 
---
They could do 1000 things right and you are ready to double down on the “I fucking hate you” attitude the minute they do one thing wrong. 
---
It’s your opinion and your life dude but, wouldn’t you think it’s also a bit too much at times? Maybe relax a bit and see how things turn out? 
---
I mean all of us here have it pretty safe when you really think about it. Private servers will be waiting the moment Classic isn’t what we expected so it’s like we can’t lose period.
---
Hard disagree for anyone who wants to hard core raid. Id argue that in classic you have to grind a ton more just for attainments, rep, consumables e.t.c 
---
Obviously 90% or so of the player base isn’t gonna be hard core raiding, but for the guilds who want to push world firsts and clear at the beginning of each phase they will for sure be minmaxing.
---
MC will be PuGed once the first wave of people hit 60. Some guilds won't have a full 40 people ready to raid for a while so you'll see an amalgamation of different players from different guilds or guildless doing 40 man "Pug" MCs and Ony pretty early on.
---
Remember that almost no fight in Vanilla has more complex mechanics than what the average player is used to from boss fights in modern WoW. A lot of them are very simple by relative standards
---
A good Druid is saving Feral Charge to use as an interrupt. You just keep him, run away, and then re-apply Rank 1 Frostbolt every time that he shifts. The key is to keep moving and not actually try to do damage until he's out of mana and can't shift anymore.
---
This can and will work against Druids who wear Rogue gear without any intellect. It won't work against Druids with PvP / hybrid gear or healing gear.
---
I just want to make sure I’m not royally screwing up, I promise.
---
You will probably enjoy it way more than retail as a new player.
---
Tokens will be enabled about the time most of the people get to 60.
---
They are on the edge of viable, amazing they are not.  They lack fundamental abilities like taunt, and debuffs for the mobs.  They can do superior threat, but at the cost of more down time and more damage taken.  There are certain dungeons or least certain pulls within dungeons in which they are wholly incapable of tanking due to mob mechanics, like heavy spell caster pulls, mana burns, or dispel spams.
---
I am from the Seattle area and darkshore is so gloomy to me. It’s just like looking outside and it’s depressing. I’m supposed to be playing a fantasy role playing game right? So I personally prefer to be in a nice sunny zone like Westfall that makes me feel better. 
---
Darkshore is a sick Zone quest wise, it’s just depressing aesthetic wise for somebody who lives in gray sky and trees 90% of the year.
---
Very helpful. Thanks for taking the time to reply.
---
This is simply not true. First of all, tanks sit to take crits purposefully and dual wield not just to do more damage/threat, but to generate more rage by hitting more often and by taking more damage. 
---
The increased parry would be very much appreciated in that regard. 
---
The only thing remotely true here is that running DW fury defiance is not a thing until you are geared. They’d get ‘wrecked’ at the same pace in both classic and on private servers.
---
evocation, mana gems, sometimes dispel curse, wands, its a real shabang. But some people don't play wow for raiding, and in PvP mages are fun as hell
---
If you are used to more modern raids in recent expansions then nothing is hard , mechanically speaking.
---
Most of what a warlock does in pve is spam Sbolt ,watching the threat meter and maintaining your priority curse every few mins.
---
Sometimes you get to cast corruption but that depends on your guild, you will also use rank 1 banish in MC a few times but after that not so much.
---
That's pretty much the entirety of buttons you'll be using in pve.
---
It's better not to play? Really?!
---
I agree with TBC being best gameplay. I feel like it was still 90% classic with class overhauls. The overhauls were enough that it made the game more balance (though still not completely) but still kept the feeling of class identity.  After TBH, classes just started kind of blurring together in favor of true balance.
---
How fuck a Keanu Reeves one would be perfect
---
Noob
---
Also PvP from 1-60 is amazing. So why rush endgame "PvP" when all the levels in-between will offer a lot more.
---
I really hope it's not gonna be 2 month per phase lol... like 4 month each stage is better
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
With a mod like Bartender you can have an entire different set of buttons based on whatever form you shift into.
---
PvP is the best option, the RP tag doesn't add as much as taking away the PvP tag takes away from the gameplay experience.
---
Lol do you always get this touchy about WoW...? 
---
Try to get out more.
---
No, stress test client.
---
No you didn't.
---
you might wanna consider it in start to make gear but it's not necessary.
---
It's funny to me how half of WoW Classic players want to play it because you have to work hard and play a lot to accomplish things and you feel like you earned them. Then the other half wants to play because you don't have to log in and play unless you want to.
---
Only possible version for gnome is a dead one tbh
---
Trash but also.. it doesn't look anything like UC.
---
for the alliance one, the plans got blown up by the level cap raising a few days before
---
ah ok, thanks for letting me know
---
Nope, they've been done sending out invites for a month or so
---
imo it is that, yeah classes arent balanced. but you still need them in raids or premades. the balancing comes down to, how a raid is built up and doesnt depent on one single class to get the job done. thats what i love about classic/vanilla.
---
95% of tanks are warriors in vanilla, 4% are ferals, 1% are groups playing around the fact that they don't have a real tank.
---
It is. If the image was uploaded to reddit, it'll take you to the pic and comments. If it was from places like imgur, it'll just take you to the imgur link of it.
---
Thanks for making this, /u/Virgin_Dildo_Lover!
---
Don't know if trolling or dumb. Either way u right.
---
Ion already said Phase 1 and Phase 2 would each be roughly 2 months long. They want the Honor System and Battlegrounds out ASAP. After that, he said the progression pace of the community would decide.
---
Care to explain why it's BiS?
---
it was confirmed to be fake and the kid just did it for the lulz btw
---
And they needed good gear, and were hamstrung by having no way to lower their massive threat.  My old guild let 1 fury warrior in, and he was great damage, but died a lot.
---
I'll need to gear for PvP though, and since I have nobody, I'll have to join a guild early on.
---
I am the same way. I don’t mind doing dailies, but when they are dailies like azerite power or for rep it feels awful. If you don’t log in daily you fall behind. If I could log in when I felt and grind for 4-5 hours rather than 1 hour a day I’d be happy. AP is fucking awful though. It’s made me hate BFA.
---
If you're tanking then u/Siloqt is right, troll is really the top pick. Berserking produces a ton of threat and in later raids threat is the main bottleneck of dps. 
---
If you're PvPing Orc is top for Hardiness + Bloodrage. BGs will see a huge volume of stuns because of grenades, trinkets, and other tryharding and resisting something like a 5-point kidney shot is a big deal. Tauren are a close 2nd due to war stomp and extended melee range, even closer if the leeway mechanic is preserved. In PvP a troll would rarely be left to freely attack and make use of berserking for the full duration, and in such scenarios any warrior would be doing a lot of damage. 
---
But maybe it would let you could clutch some fights out at low health as fury. Swifty proved dual wield fury is viable and a lot of his clips show Blood Craze and Bloodthirst keeping him swinging at minimal health long enough to finish people — as a troll that swan song would be even more powerful.
---
One of the biggest appeals to me on paladin is that ideal pvp and pve specs are almost 100% identical.  So pvp a lot is the answer.  
---
You can aoe farm some as holy paladin.  I will likely level a mage or rogue alt when I don't have people around and I want to solo pvp.
---
Basically cast shadow bolt 99% of the time.
---
The point is that you can farm all of that as long as you want without a time gate or diminishing returns. With dailies, once you've finished them you're done for the day. You earn rewards once a day and then the incentive is gone.
---
I topped around 11 in raids until early Cata
---
Priests do whatever the fuck we want. DoTs, HoTs, and smashin thots. Priestgang, scrubs.
---
Hopefully the rest of the FPS
---
The math doesn't seem to check out on that though.
---
Assuming all 40 players level at record speeds that averages out to ~5 days /played. That's 4-5 days of no sleep, so already all 40 of those players are sleep deprived and hallucinating.
---
Give them another day to sleep and get attuned (not hard).
---
That leaves one night to actually raid and finish MC in quest items.
---
It's not impossible I guess but it just seems highly unlikely if you factor in real time sleep into the /played.
---
If you can go 5 days straight with no sleep and then be coherent enough to raid for X hours in quest gear you're an anomaly among humans.
---
Why use mooncloth when you can just buy a traveler's backpack for way cheaper, though?
---
Just play horde then
---
*Queen starts playing*
---
Personally, I’d rather have Ogres than the broken. The fact that the alliance ended up getting them in the form of Kul Tirans is just insult to injury.
---
Does anyone know what addon gives that bar at the top?
---
i get it
---
It’s less about how much you have to grind and more about giving the players the choice of when to do it. Dailies imply you have to do them every single day to keep up with others. That sucks. If I want log in once or twice a week and spend 4-5 hours on those days farming that would be better. Give me the choice, don’t corral me into logging in every day to farm quests so blizzard can inflate their daily log on numbers. AP is fucking awful.
---
You believe anything you read?
---
I did a BRD run once where the tank was wearing half leather for more DPS.  The healer were having a hell of time keeping him alive.
---
Literally the first thing I noticed
---
DASSSS RAGEEEEE. LET IT CONSUME YOU
---
yea I agree man, Eastern Kingdoms has nothing on Kalimdor
---
Sounds like the best way to get an RP name is to give yourself a non-rp name that gets changed. Most people don't choose their own names anyway.
---
I took a look at the MPQ files for 1.12.1, and the ones in interface.mpq (and were never changed in a patch.mpq) match the ones in the videos.  I also took a look at the 2.0.1 prepatch, but no TalentFrame image changes were made during it.
---
i cannot second that.
---
Classic is using the BFA Macro system.
---
They are in the beta but would be surprised if they aren’t removed and added back for the AQ patch. Doesn’t make sense to have AQ quest available but not the Argent Dawn revamp.
---
Before that, the only repeatable is morrowgrain for Thunder Bluff/Darnassus
---
Warlocks are completely different in raids and 5 man content.
---
For raids, depending on raid makeup/assignments/boss fight, you could literally only press Shadowbolt.
---
For 5 mans, Warlocks have arguably the most options at their disposal. https://imgur.com/r/classicwow/O1J0hZB
---
Scroll through that and Warlocks will jump out at you. There are a ton of different spell options, and depending on your spec and party make up, you could be paying attention to a seduce timer/counter spell need, a feared mob, 3+ dots, shadowbolting.
---
No one goes into a dungeon expecting that of the Warlock though, and the number of times it's necessary is pretty low
---
Yeah there used to be a Nessie in there somewhere to
---
He raided into Naxx. Think he knows how top tier raiding goes, and what is viable to get yhere.
---
The most unexciting stat ever.

This guy is well on his way to get to the same level of dontgiveafuck as Assmon.
---
Ended up finding the screenshot - it was 14,901 https://i.imgur.com/P1QEX7A.jpg
---
Mind you, the servers had a capacity of around 10,000, so there were more than 24,000 players actively trying to play at the same time.
---
Yeah for making bags it could be good but I assume there will be so many players selling bags in the AH so prices will probably not be so good. Should be better to just skin and herb/mine.
---
That doesn't look like Stormwind at all!
---
But it's still amazing to look at, mate. I am in awe.
---
My point is that you shouldn't discount the importance of the social contract.  Obviously our experiences regarding this topic have been different, but that's okay--good, even.  In my experience, groups rolling need on BoE gear is okay not just because it neutralizes potential ninjas, but because the groups have previously agreed to do so.  If you and I agree to split the spare change we found on the ground or...flip a coin, then what's the problem?
---
BoP is different than BoE in their relative values of gold as compared to combat use; this derives from the mechanical difference between them, namely that BoE gear can be traded and posted on the auction house.  Therefore, the potential monetary benefit from rolling need on BoP gear that isn't intrinsically useful is, in some cases, multiple orders of magnitude lower than the benefit of rolling need on BoE gear that isn't intrinsically useful.
---
Both can be sold for gold, but if we find 100 gold bars of buried treasure and I take 99 and give you one, I imagine you'd take issue with "both result in gold".  When a piece of BoP gear vendors for 5g, the stats on that gear are relatively more important than when a piece of similar BoE gear fetches 500g on the auction house.  It's basic opportunity cost.
---
&gt;To say someone will use an AH item is not only an assumption but even if it were 100% true, that someone was not there for the drop. That may not matter to you, which causes as I said, an impasse.
---
I'm honestly not sure what you're trying to argue here, so forgive me if I'm misreading.  If no one is interested in using an item, it doesn't sell (at least, not at a high price).  If it doesn't sell, it doesn't get ninja'd (generally).  People don't start forum drama over someone needing on random greens.  Further, the whole point of BoE gear and the auction house is that players don't need to be there when the item drops.  If we wanted to restrict the use of items to players that were physically present when those items dropped, why would BoE items even exist?
---
&gt;As for why someone should get to roll, it's incredibly clear and objective. If you need the item, you need. If you intend to sell the item, you greed.
---
Okay, I'm leveling my Mage alt in whatever dungeon PuG and Edgemaster's Handguards drop.  My main is a Warrior.  Am I entitled to roll need because I intend to use the item on my Warrior?  I'm not selling them, after all.  What if instead of *my* Warrior, it's my friend's Warrior?  I'd be giving them to him, because he's my friend.  Plus, he's main tank for our guild, so I'm still benefiting from that gear, and as long as I'm benefiting a non-zero amount, I'm entitled to roll need on it.  Right?  You say it's binary, I say it isn't.
---
The passionate people working on Classic are not the people who would decide to put mtx in
---
Depends on the player base.  Alliance was generally worse in vanilla because it attracted more kids.  Not sure if it will be the same this time.
---
1. DELEGATE DELEGATE DELEGATE.
---
2. Sometimes the best thing for your guild is the least efficient one when it comes to gameplay.
---
female gnome tripping of her thunderfury is always a nice sight. would play/10
---
wasnt subpar when i played resto and was regularly top 5-10 on most of MC and BWL bosses on ely
---
&gt;Warlocks, my for-sure first choice for a long time, face a faction full of fear/charm resist when played on Alliance, and then there's shard farming and the debuff limit too.
---
Shard farming is a prettty miniscule part of the game, and isn't really something you should let your class choice be based on. Debuff limit is going to be 16, which sure, you can't use your dots if that's the only thing you wanted to do in raiding. 
---
&gt;Rogues and Mages are both great, but as a result are viciously overplayed and face competition when gearing.
---
According to Pserver data, they are like 13% each, which is not high at all when you consider there are 9 classes in total. Plus, they are the most wanted DPS in raids (before warrior dps becomes insane) so there will be more mages and rogues, but more slots to fill to compensate. 
---
&gt;Druids and Paladins feel outclassed nearly entirely in PvE, and if healing/tanking isn't your business then warriors/priest nearly go out the window too. Only shamans I know very little about so I can't comment.
---
i never liked paladins or druids, so i can't comment other than they are great in PvP

This is what I plan on doing while near 100% level with a warrior.  We plan on funnelling the warrior the ideal loot, so I suspect I will be in a mix of not plate with some caster stats.  The goal of this spec was to pick of consecration and base healing talents by the mid 30s when the warrior gets whirlwind, so we can aoe level packs when possible.  Then fill out the rest of ret so I am somewhat capable of adding damage when we are are only able to pull mobs 1-2 at a time.
---
There was no linen turn in whatsoever.
---
You forgot silk between mageweave and wool.
---
No confirmation at all.
---
I just didn't read your message properly, thought you were saying others are more important.
---
Personally 8.2 didn't change anything for me. Live is still the same beast as it was before the patch - a completely different game. I don't post here because I want to play on live. 
---
Fair is fair though - I did try it, and I got bored after exploring the new zone for a bit and doing the intro quests. Whenever new content drops I tend to enjoy myself a fair bit for a few hours up to a couple of days until I run out of new storylines and cinematics. I'm sure many others feel the same.
---
Yep gonna edit it now
---
No WoW classic, I would go back to private servers if they did that
---
I’m keeping up with it and I hate it but I’m worried I’ll miss out on content like the mage tower. I missed out on that stuff in Legion because I quit and came back late. I didn’t get the mage tower skins at all and it still hurts. 
---
God do I hate the AP grind. It’s made me hate BFA.
---
The beta is dead
---
Not enough trees to be Darnassus.
---
That is for raiding (in most fights).
---
&gt;My playstyle is that at max level, I like to farm 5 man content as well as casually enter the raid scene.
---
Daily quests make your peepee shrink.
---
Maybe it's just a really bad painting of Ironforge?
---
Less for bags, more for greens to assist in making wands from enchanting and later for a few gear pieces.
---
The level cap was increased to level 40.  People still haven't farmed their level 40 bis I guess.
---
Nobody is playing Beta anymore and Blizzard isn't inviting more people, they didn't even have enough players for the NA stress test.
---
Good so we can just not include your opinion on anything relevant, thanks.
---
Groups that reserve items make me want to roll a tank just so I can exclude them.
---
you can help others by ganking every player you see so your factionbuddies can lvl in peace!
---
&gt; Can anyone tell me if I’m a jerk if I don’t use a single macro?
---
&gt;Am I really oblivious to a better gaming experience on this one?
---
What's your favourite class? I'm sure I can come up with at least 1 macro that will make the experience better or easier.
---
Wow, excellent information. Thanks for sharing.

God dayum you brought a lot of nature pots!

Its far easier to RP on a PvP server than it is to PvP on an RP server

I mean, just browsing through LegacyPlayers just now confirms the fact that they're usually at the bottom spots in terms of raw healing output.
---
All the items like Azurezong Mageblade (it got 40 spell damage in later patches) are version 1.12 from the beginning. However each Phase will define if that item can be created and dropped. Not all items will be in from the start.
---
MOGA
---
Would you only do this once you’re near pre raid bis for the run or will people accept this from anyone willing to tank?
---
In this situation its not ninja at all. My concern is when for example a good 2H axe drops for a warrior and a hunter, upgrade for both, who has priority? Or a good bow drops for a hunter and warrior, upgrade for both of them. I think the class that has more benefits from the item should get it, but of course it mostly happens with weapons.
---
Exactly. Dailies that are the sole gate for a faction's reputation are probably the worst example of this, and probably the worst thing put into the game. Even if you want to argue about feeling compelled to farm gold or raid mats or whatever, *nothing* compares to the knowledge that every day you don't do your X faction dailies is another day you don't get the Exalted rewards, and that no amount of grinding will make up that difference.
---
Look at something like Timbermaw Hold. It was an obnoxious rep grind to many people, but you knew you were basically in for however many hours of farming furbolgs. You could bang it out in one session if you were dedicated (perhaps very), or spread it out across days and weeks of playtime. At the end of the day, it was a goal you could make a set amount of progress towards. Furthermore, you can organize a group to do it more efficiently, find better locations to farm certain materials or mobs, and otherwise find better methods of accomplishing the goal.
---
Reputations with dailies are fundamentally dissociated from anything other than your commitment to logging in. You can't bank progress on a day you have more time to play, and instead you make a set amount of progress towards Exalted. If you miss a day, there aren't catch-up mechanics - you can't make up for it later, no matter what.
---
Not true. Period.
---
Painfully aware of this. 
---
But the last tourney pulled well over 100k concurrent viewers so I figured the players would log on for that to harvest stream cash.
---
I guess I should mention that you could repeatedly turn in 20 runecloth after turning in the initial 60 as well.
---
100% agree, but that design philosophy opens the door for people who play 5 hours each day to completely lap everyone else. I’m fine with it, and much prefer classic to all other wow iterations.
---
Why two periods?
---
That is absolutely hilarious.
---
Gears going to come from raiding in Phase 1. Unless you're joining a hardcore PvE progression guild there's no point to rush for the gearing either.
---
You still have to wait for all the Warriors, Priests, Shaman and Paladins to catch up anyways.
---
Well yeah but that does not necessarily make one good at that, all classes have their strengths and weaknesses
---
They just invited the wrong people to the beta. I know tons of people that are waiting around for invites, but don't play retail. 
---
So sad to see nobody on it.
---
you have every right to disagree, so let's just agree to disagree
---
They're all but guaranteed to release TBC and Wotlk servers too if Classic is successful enough, so that's who knows how many more years of development they have to put in to get those out.
---
Yep. Hence the "guild joining". I do not mind being in a hardcore PvE progression guild, I always did my PvP-ing solo anyways.
---
I’ve tried to be a helpful Rogue: https://shadowpanther.net
---
That is a pretty good description here. We just don’t know yet which SoR Version we’re getting. If I get Kevin Jordan right a Lot of the SoR benefits came on accident and we’ll have to see if they iron it out or leave it in.
---
Maybe J. Allen Brack has intentionally tried to slay the hype for classic before launch by letting beta stagnate and not invite anybody just so he can say I told you so \*wraps head in tinfoil\*
---
whats a jump run please?
---
Thanks, I've been confused about profession choice but these guidelines basically sum it all up. What would You say about Paladins? I plan to alt one.
---
Yea that's what I figured you'd rather go back to a product with broken mechanics, loot tables, stat values etc 
---
Because those aren't worse than a cosmetic shop lol
---
The game eventually gets to the point where it feels like a job, and that’s when I know it’s time for a break.
---
Really man, this is some seriously good shit. Props! FTMFH!
---
There could also be a a world boss that you can kill for a nice rep boost, but you can only kill them once a week for the rep
---
SoR was just meant to be added damage, it causing procs to happen was a happy accident
---
It was during the WoD daily login garrison days, that I heard about Nostalrius in trade chat.
---
That really opened my eyes to why I enjoyed the game in the first place. Look where we are now, getting back to our roots.
---
Ironforge sure does look different
---
No, it's closer to 4 days /played, which is our recruiting cutoff.
---
All of our raid members have been able to beat the available benchmarks for Joana's ~ 4d21h run by about 15%. And this is largely without the support network of gear/mat/gold/consumable feeders, dungeon crawlers, and summoners we'll have available to us on launch.
---
We fully expect to have some members hit 60 within 90 hours and many of the key players will be leveled around-the-clock with teams so they'll have extra time to gear up.
---
It's 182 hours between launch and raid reset.
---
We need ~12 hours to get everyone attuned, get 7 people the rep for quintessences, and actually clear the raid.
---
Of the 170 hours remaining, only ~100 of them is used for leveling.
---
So there's plenty of time to sleep.
---
I'd feel incredibly sad and defeated if this snowballs into ruining classic.
---
I've always said that I'd be fine with it ending up being small and niched as long as we can maintain a few healthy servers.
---
Mate, would you mind to explain to me why shadow priest is huge?
---
&gt;So which group the feral dps belongs in classic? Rouge like or closer to warrior and pala level?
---
Um... warrior dps and paladin dps are different ends of the spectrum..... warriors are #1 on dps and paladins are last place....
---
But to answer your question, feral dps is lower middle.
---
How am I a victim? I'm calling a dude out for a ridiculous claim and he's just jumping from non relevant point to ad hominem instead of even bothering to respond to his bullshit statement.
---
It's like arguing with a flat earther or bible thumper.
---
How am I a boomer, I'm literally born in the late 80's...My parent was a boomer.
---
Umm that’s not Ironforge
---
Yes, I didn't see the changes they made. They're basically the changes I suggested here.
---
So you know. I was right, and they did take ideas from EQ (or came up with them independantly).
---
Basically my post is valid and your an argumentative twat who doesn't wanna fix anything or argue in good faith you just wanna be an annoying argumentative asshole.
---
You were wrong, and I'm blocking you now, because you have nothing to say.
---
Boomer mentality
---
Even greens while you're leveling in a dungeon?
---
You don't need to worry at all! I played vanilla wow 15 years ago and quit after the first expansion. I had 3x level 60 characters back in the days, and I did both PvE and PvP, but I spent most of my time on world pvping and battlegrounds, I did all the 5 men dungeons but I only did a few early 40 men raid dungeons, and most of us didn't even complete the entire 40 men dungeons (the dungeons were really hard for everyone, people were still trying to figure out the boss mechanics, only a few elite guilds finished it).
---
Like you did, I recently played on the undocumented server to get a feel of the game and tried to plan what I should do when classic launches, guess what? I didn't even fully remember the mechanics of the early dungeons (The deadmines, The Stockade, Gnomergan..etc), I leveled to lv30 and quit because I felt it's pointless to continue there, I want to enjoy the content in Classic.
---
Woosh!
---
I'm prepared to dedicate myself to a guild if they're willing to take me along, so long as we've got a similar schedule. Hell, I'm even willing to heal until I get decent shadow gear if that's what it'll take. 
---
As for the profession thing, I figured I'd mention it cause I'll probably end up running Alchemy if I go SPriest, that way I can give out consumables as a bit of a sweetener to invite me back next time.
---
It depends on the group. This became more and more popular as the patches progressed, and was mainstream by BC. 
---
I'm hoping that some groups will set up the loot rules differently (where need actually means need) and more importantly that loot rules will be discussed in dungeons I group with, but if wishes were fishes, I would feast.
---
I just want to state that nobody answered the OPs question... I’m curious either. Does anybody know?
---
The orcs needed a place to settle into?
---
For BOE's, generally I always need, because I need the gold if I don't need the item.  It's only fair that everyone gets a fair shot at a BOE.
---
If it's BOP then I would respect the need before greed thing, unless I saw something shady (like a leather user rolling on a plate item, I would need to counter it).
---
There's no timer, just a flat decrease of 5g every month.
---
Truly the worst oversight in vanilla was the lack of Treeant form for Resto Druids
---
&gt;all specs are viable for their intended role
---
Show me how viable ret DPS is.
---
If we are including dire maul gear then Gallants Wristguards are definitely pre-bis plate or not.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18459
---
A Priest’s only weakness is that we run out of plebs to shit on and thots to smash. You would understand if you were playing the alpha class too.
---
How can you give this gold? I hope it was ironic
---
Such an awful city compared to Ironforge and Stormwind. 
---
It’s not even a discussion.
---
Why is that wrong, though?  It's BOE, everyone gets an equal shot at it.  Whether you need to equip it, or need to sell it to buy something else you equip it, it's the same to me.
---
I do play priest....
---
I'm curious about the leveling, not the endgame potential.
---
for me its the more beatifil, atmospheric zones, way cooler cities and better quest and dungeonn hubs.
---
If you're putting in 100% of the effort then solo the dungeon. Oh wait, you're likely putting in 20% and there for other items as well. Flask reserved groups are annoying sure, but it's nice to have a geared tank/healer carry you through a dungeon while the only thing "reserved" is a valuable recipe that probably won't even drop.
---
holy paladin are extremely high demand, but the supply for holy paladins is also quite high
---
you're pretty critical to the raids success because of you lop 30% off the threat ceiling
---
This ^
---
You’re so correct on think. I think the haters don’t really understand the difference between it takes 30 hours to do X vs it takes 1 hour for 30 days to do X... the first one you can manage and carve into your life how you see fit. Need AV rep? Your choice to bang it out all in a weekend or play on and off until it’s done. You don’t have to run 1 AV a day for 60 days... It means time away doesn’t have to delay you because you have a choice to catch up! I’ve been playing P Servers and can say this feeling is absolutely real. And bonus points to gaining double XP when not playing. The feeling of logging in after a few days off is exciting and not guilt for missing out. Given this ends after 60 but is still nice!
---
Lots of people think they know the answers. Some of them will be right. Some of them will be wrong. We will see come Naxx classic. :)
---
Changing forms already gives you a new hotbar. The macros do a lot more than change my buttons based on my form. They also change my form depending on what I'm trying to cast, target things differently, and have a lot of other features.
---
Why daggers tho
---
This is the reason I never liked Outland. Just felt off..
---
Show what is a lie? What do you think you are talking about?
---
Be reasonable.
---
&gt; How do you go about determining where the magical line for this value is?
---
&gt; 
---
I mean, BOE's sell for 10s or even 100s of gold, and BOP will net you a dozen silver at vendor or in D/E mats.
---
You're right that anyone can vendor a BOP, but the difference is no one gets to use it if you vendor it.  When you sell it on the AH, it's going to someone who will equip it and use it.
---
So fundamentally, the difference I think is if the item will be going to waste or not.
---
Not my groups. If you roll Need and don't equip I'm kicking you and not grouping again.
---
warrior is slower
---
I wasn't saying not to use macros with mouseovers/modifiers and such, I was just pointing out that you don't need the form checks because you can get different bars when in different forms.
---
Edgy
---
Except that by selling or deing it someone is also using it. So what's the difference in **your** logic here?
---
What does that even mean? How the fuck do I have a Boomer mentality lol I'm at ends with Boomers on a daily basis.
---
What because I spent a decade not gaming and establishing myself in the real world so I can actually own a kick ass PC and relax gaming in a house I own? That's a boomer mentality then sign me up.
---
I'd rather that then whatever mentality the few above are rocking. I'm not ashamed for not knowing some modern aspects and admitting what my knowledge limits are from Vanilla.
---
I was wondering the same thing why no one was streaming classic on Twitch.. was the server got taken down or the streamers just stopped playing at the same time? I Didn't pay attention to the classic news for a few days.
---
I should probably stop taking-for-granted that people want to raid. 
---
It's tough because I can't imagine the game without it... and I don't even care about raiding! It's just that PVP becomes so inaccessible without it.
---
no, because you don't get holy shock til 40. plus you really need +spell power to shine as a shockadin which is not something that happens on leveling mail/plate. it's really only a possible build for well geared 60s.
---
that said, try it out. prove me wrong.
---
Good tidings, traveller; please consider signing our petition, even if you, personally, are not going to play RP-PVP.   
---
If you prefer PVP, imagine being trapped in a casual, raid-centric PvE environment because Blizzard has some very wrongheaded ideas about the level of interest in PvP servers.  
---
If you prefer PvE, imagine being forced into a stressful, harrowing experience of constantly struggling against unprovoked ambushes to make any progress or enjoy the game, because Blizzard thinks your play preference is irrelevant.  
---
Would you not hope those on all sides of the issue would see and appreciate your plight, and support your completely reasonable request for just one server which supports the large community of people who feel the same way you do? Please, help us RP-PvPrs get just a single server to call home, even if only so you don't have those Goldshire Inn weirdos creeping you out every time you just want to get some Darkmoon Faire buffs.
---
Holy shock on live is your best friend, in vanilla it is a niche heal that kinda sucks and honestly best for doing damage.
---
Flash of light is hard hitting and spends a lot of mana on live, in vanilla it is so weak it is like a hot tick, but it makes up for it by being by far the cheapest heal in the game.  The way scaling works in vanilla, this is really valuable as you get more+healing gear flash of light eventually becomes the best heal for any class in the game.  
---
Holy light is more like live flash, high hps and high cost, but it is super slow.  The goal is to get enough +healing so that you can quit using holy light in favor of more flash of light play
---
Cleanse is very cheap and has no CD, so thats nice.  Other then priests, other healers cannot dispel magic so it has a lot of value. 
---
Paladin is very immobile then in live, but then again everything is less mobile other then druid.  On live there has been a multi-expansion arms race between kiters and kitees.  Every melee class seems to have 3+catch up abilities, and  every kiter 3+escapes.  This was mostly not the case in vanilla, so blessing of freedom is FAR more impactful, as well as a timely cleanse.  Freedom also has an insane 80% uptime(when talented).
---
You survivalability is actually unique.  Seemingly everyone is a tank in live, especially so in pvp.  With some damage redux activated and/or passive.  This isn't the case in vanilla.  Paladin is uniquly tanky, and divine shield/bop is something other classes lack and need badly.  Plate on a healer is honestly overpowered.  This adds a lot of value to paladin.  
---
Lastly, CC matters more in vanilla I think, but CC chains maybe less.  All healers will get CC focused, paladins are uniquely immune to poly via use of blessing of sacrifice.  I am sure you've used it on live to pre-break a poly, but in vanilla it has no CD so you can place it on multiple allies.  In addition magic effects, by default are not shown to enemy forces so the enemies propensity to purge them off is greatly reduced.  
---
Curse of tongues in the fucking worst for holy paladin in pvp.  Make sure you group with  mage that knows how to decurse or else every fight against a warlock will make you want to quit.
---
Vanilla isn't that hard a game to learn, you'll do fine buddy.
---
Aren't they also intentionally disabling many of its features to make it more vanilla-like?
---
The answer is still the same really. 
---
* if feral and warrior are both equally geared, the warrior out dps the feral by a good amount. 
---
* if feral out gears a warrior, then the can get close to warriors dps.
---
This is for pve dps. (Paladin is still last.)
---
Partial-resists are only affected by the target's resistance (and consequently helped by your penetration).
---
Full resists can either be from a miss or from resistance, there is no way of telling which it is.
---
Ethical surprise mechanics new band name called it!
---
&gt; tbh, i really like the change on live to where gear is meaningless (nearly).
---
​Is this true for PvP on live now as well? I got burned out grinding for BiS pvp gear after MoP launched. I couldnt do the 2 month grind all over again just to be competitive.
---
Here's an upvote so maybe we get fewer engineers grenading me, netting me, one shotting me with death ray, reflecting fear, or disorienting me for 30 seconds. Terrible pvp profession.
---
I would recommend an alternative to Ret Paladin - Spell Power.
---
See my comment exactly after that. They are viable. Far from optimal.
---
In what world is the raid waiting to MC Pallys for a 15 minute buff? LOL
---
Ironforge would like a word.
---
Speedrunning, obviously.
---
What was that addon call at the top of screen. I totally forgot!
---
arent those servers kinda dead now?  i havent played since classic announcement
---
yeah most druids weren't high up, cos they are poop.  I did just fine with my slightly unorthodox build
---
Can blizzard hire you already
---
I don't think anyone thinks MC is going to be hard.  Even BWL and 1st half of AQ40 shouldn't be hard outside maybe Nef(especially horde).  2nd half of AQ40/optionals and most of Naxx will be where people actually find it somewhat challenging but still easily doable with whatever comp you bring, if sufficiently geared outside a few outliers (4HM=8 tanks cant get around that really).
---
I agree. My problem is that I have to work a couple of months at a time and then I'll be away from a good internet connection.
---
Current content is killer for that. Even though I like to do mythic raiding, what guild wants to boost a healer into gear every few months only for that healer to go away a few months later again.
---
I still keep up with the itemization requirement for mythic raiding. But no one to do it with. Relegated to alt runs and stuff. I was barely able to get ahead of the curve last time.
---
At least with classic it will be static content. I could go on a break for a few months and then come back and continue. I wouldn't miss an expansion since there isn't one.
---
yes
---
if the fights slow. people are exaggerating how long it takes for SotC to be worth it. You can actually do the math yourself ingame. typically if the target would survive judging 3 SoRs Sotc is worthwhile. You open up with the SotC so that all your holy damage gets a bonus. Also if you are leveling with another paladin then SoTc is obviously worthwhile
---
But in quick solo fight its not worthwhile.
---
They don't have a choice. As soon as you say "Need 3 dps for Strat, 2 orbs reserved", you're going to be flooded with whispers from people wanting in.
---
so the awesome verigans fist should be used with SoR? so sad.
---
I edited my post a little more, take a look.  They are not using it to full effectiveness, and depriving someone else of a usable item.
---
So obviously the etiquette on this is not set in stone or universally understood.
---
Personally, I think "all Need on blue/purple BoEs" makes sense. It makes ninja looting impossible, it's absolutely equitable, and if someone in the party really wants it for themselves they can buy it off the winner. But I don't think that system is universally agreed on.
---
I can’t confirm that personally, but I imagine they wouldn’t alter a ton. 
---
All of my basic macros for spells, pet control, and one shot macros work fine. I haven’t tried anything like focus targets or mouse overs unfortunately.
---
I don't. It's just a guideline to follow. If you know the fight well, rarely die, and do good in your role, I dont care what you do. I was talking about the elitist who isn't as good as he thinks he is and dies due to trying to play better than they are.
---
Nobody "geared" is going to be reserving shit. If they are "geared" they are going to go with their own guild and avoid the drama in the first place. People reserving are going to be cobbled together nobodies who are just hoping to get lucky.
---
No, although they could be worse. 
---
 But actually running flags is better left to druids and mages, and fighting thru mid with the flag is better left to warriors than to reckoning paladins.
---
There’s so much love behind wow classic i think it’s going to do better than BFA. People haven’t changed, the game has. It was more popular and loved back then and when it’s re released I think it will be again.
---
The only news I heard from blizzard before blizcon was the quell expectations
---
Really well done! I enjoy the color pallet, it fits the feel of the city perfectly.
---
I think I might just flip a coin right before creating a character lol
---
&gt; arent those servers kinda dead now?  i havent played since classic announcement 
---
They're definitely more dead now, but some of the hardcore guilds still play and it was the same when Private servers were popular.
---
&gt; yeah most druids weren't high up, cos they are poop.  I did just fine with my slightly unorthodox build 
---
They can still be subpar, just because you're good at playing them. That's my point.
---
I've always been one to say "need if you need it" no matter what the item is. Though, my definition of need is "I'm going to use it." so, I kind of agree with you.
---
Lol same ... dude could hang up there pretty well DPS-wise but he splatted way more than anyone else.  I think by 1.12 threat gen gets buffed enough that it is easier to pull off.
---
Most players will definitely not be (nor were they in Vanilla) in one of these types of guilds.
---
As jesus intended.
---
I was under the impression the WoW has more of a Horde player base than an Alliance one. Could be wrong though.
---
the long game will be shaman pvp.  gonna have to clear the pve side of things first wearing a dress
---
Touche! lol
---
Honest question because I haven't played since TBC and haven't followed the game since WOTLK Naxx was cleared in 48 hours: are people skipping dungeons and actually contributing/doing the latest raid with other people who skipped dungeons or is it just the getting carried through and the loot system means they can catch up fast?
---
I'm leaning more towards this over skinning and tailoring.
---
I dont know how many tanks and healers there will be in classic, but in vanilla some people who waited for an hour every night for those would probably sacrifice their first born son for a quick full group.
---
People will probably accept this at any stage, you dont have to carry the group completely, but you should at least know what you are doing in my opinion, or it comes off a little scammy maybe.
---
That record was set by a Hunter.
---
You're telling me your Warriors, Paladins, Priests and Shamans are ALL going to be beating that record?
---
That's Noon on Friday if you don't sleep, get up from your desk, lift your hand up off the mouse or keyboard to scratch your nose......
---
Even if one or two monsters can no-life it that hardcore and go that many houses without sleep or even moving (while ignoring all the physical effects that will happen to your body and cognitive functions) that still is very unlikely for a full 40 people to achieve in unison.
---
Unless all of you will be in a box with no windows and a toilet in your chair with adrenaline being pumped into your veins and medical staff nearby to assist with the problems that will start occuring at just 72 hours played you're just being delusional to think this will work without a all the dominos falling perfectly into place.
---
Im not saying it's impossible but I truly believe you're underestimating a lot of your times, drastically , while not factoring into account the reality of the real world outside the game.
---
Global Warming , still arctic
---
Naxx is an extreme example because it was at the end of vanilla and terribly unbalanced (Gear wise and mechanics wise).
---
&gt;WOLVE (PvE attack boost)
---
*melee. Useless for Hunter themself.
---
Just set your hs in Kargarth and you're 2 minutes away from BRM. If you're goblin engineer (you should be, after having crafted all the gnomish stuff ofc) you have a port to everlook, 2-3 minutes flight to Orgrimmar and it's zeppelin. I don't feel like alliance has that big of an advantage when it comes from travelling.
---
Server size is going to be key. No need for 8+ servers and myself being on oceanic we will either have our own which I doubt(which you'd only legit 3 server for the population) or will have to suffer the 400ping which will honestly kill it for me.
---
I think it got buffed/over-hauled early-mid way through vanilla and did good DPS at the time.  The problem is that threat gen for tanks didnt get a boost until relatively late in vanilla which allowed them to actually do their full DPS without face planting.  By the time that happened there wasn't enough time to recruit/gear out fury warriors for it to be a significant trend.
---
PvP gear is impossible to get now. It's 100% rng in what you get.
---
To be fair it’s not like people in Quebec even make an effort to be liked by the rest of Canada which is unfortunate... (I am from and live in Montreal)
---
On my mage I dropped skinning, leveled tailoring to 300, made my robe of power, dropped tailoring for engineering, then come ZG dropped mining for tailoring.
---
Pretty sure Warlock has the weakest of the tailoring chestpieces, so look into it and decide if leveling tailoring for 1 item is worth it.
---
A stone and leather tent? The greatest city until it rains!
---
Looks like TitanPanel to me.
---
Passive gains from playing them game naturally (not specifically grinding for it) will keep you at an appropriate AP level for most players. Only the most hardcore actually need to gain as much ap as possible. The minuscule gains for most players is pointless, and they put that on themselves to grind. It’s a player propagated issue.
---
Not really advantage, destroyed alot of guilds
---
IMO if you don’t take skinning while leveling you’re missing out on half the loot every time you kill a beast. I’d take skinning for the first 40 levels or so and just vendor the leather as you go. You can use that cash later to buy AH materials to level up the professions you actually want for end game.
---
Because of karma.
---
No one actually cares about world firsts except for a small minority. Most of us just want to kill big monsters.
---
I think it was called Titan Bar?
---
Lol. He should.
---
&gt; Whoa whoa whoa. More value how exactly? How do you go about determining where the magical line for this value is?
---
This seems extremely simple to me. You tell me where the reasoning goes wrong.
---
A BoP thing drops which is a big upgrade for you and is vendor fodder for me. I can vendor it for 2g.
---
If I take it, I will not use it and I will vendor it for 2g.
---
If you take it you get a big upgrade, use it for many hours of gameplay, and then vendor it for 2g.
---
You get more value from it than me, because you get an upgrade *and* exactly as much money.
---
What part of this do you disagree with or not understand?
---
porque no los dos?
---
Noobnoob
---
Asmongold said he’s gonna host one in a few days. Prize money will be a couple grand.
---
People are in Tier sets because that's all they could get. Everyone is acting like they are going to run a dungeon 1 time and get every item from that dungeon they needed. Dude it could take you a year to get your 'best in slot.'
---
Beta is pretty much dead

/r/wooosh
---
I generally hate customized UI. But yours is beautiful.
---
Hail, friend.
---
Something need doing?
---
Lay Trap, pet prowl, shadowmeld all in 1 button macro. 
---
Shadowmeld is seriously underrated and amazing for hiding or for ambushing enemy factions in world pvp.
---
You can also eat then shadowmeld as well.
---
Super untrue
---
Terrible? Shiiiit, i get all the ladies with my full epic set.
---
I wouldn’t bother until there’s enough testing to make sure pServer proc-rates and SpPwr scaling aren’t totally wrong.
---
2-3 hunters per raid.

Its almost a meme on this forum, that warrior leveling is a chore, and they are the slowest levelers... Now you telling me, that a decent geared warrior out DPS a druid, one of the fastest one? 
---
(Were the private servers so far away from the correct values?)
---
I like to PvP. Missing passive traits from the new essences and passives from the old season azerite gear puts me at a disadvantage. If I don’t want to be at a disadvantage I need to grind. I don’t do casual raiding either, I’m only interested in Mythic. It absolutely matters to those aspects of the game. I fell behind playing passively. I do the bare minimum for world quests and islands because they are not fun to me. Making those aspects of the game the main source of AP sucks.
---
That's fair, it definitely has a grimmer aesthetic.  But hey, to get to 20 you're not going to be able to quest solely in Westfall, so if you have to quest in multiple places why not knock out Darkshore first?  That's the way I see it at least.
---
They are just the best for tranquilizing shot
---
Mud hut garbage town you mean
---
"Viable" would be doing like 10-15% dps less than the "optimal" guys.
---
Just cause you technically can raid because one dps out of 25 doesn't matter that much, doesn't make it VIABLE.
---
This isn’t ironforge
---
This doesn't look like Ironforge...
---
The one thing you're wrong on is AV. Alliance has a huge advantage in all versions of classic AV, with their biggest advantage being in 1.12 AV (the version being used.) 
---
Alliance can cap the horde towers uncontested by the NPCs, has an amazing choke point at the bridge, can use a snowbank to jump over the base in the horde wall, and a few other things I'm drawing a blank on right now.
---
Horde had an advantage in 2.3 AV because they could beat alliance to a choke point and just turtle there until all their reinforcements were gone, which sucked for both parties. I'm not really sure where it went after that
---
Lol well there's that lol

Is this your work?

I'm very split between warrior and rogue. I absolutely loved my time playing a warrior during the arena days TBC and WotLK, there was so much depth to being a -good- warrior back then. Stance dancing, timing your spell reflect, charging left and right...
---
In the last few expacs, I was forced to switch to rogue as I felt they were closest to that sort of playstyle after the inevitable dumbing down of classes.
---
Now I am very split, do I go back to my old favourite warrior or do I stick to rogue? I feel like playing a warrior in PvP on high level will be frustrating if I remember how much easier it was to kite them in classic. Any suggestions?
---
How do you think this would snowball and ruin classic?
---
Stormwind isn't in this painting?

---
I like it!
---
Unless you are in the upper echelon of pvp and pve, your performance and personal reactions will matter more than a trait.
---
If you aren’t in a Hallf of Fame guild or a gladiator in pvp (or rank 14 in rbg), then it generally isn’t going to mean the difference between winning or losing. Fucking up a mechanic or poor cd usage will be a much larger factor.
---
I guess that's still art.
---
“Didn’t have enough players for the stress test”
---
I mean it’s like you’re making things up to try and convince people that a game in beta is dead.
---
If you have a really good mix of prot and fury raid gear, it’s actually decent, but arms is soooooooooooo strong, that whatever prot can do is worthless. 
---
You can surprise people tho, especially if you have a really good 1hander, such as thunderfury.
---
Qeynos for life
---
At this point, mind compiling a full HD map of all your added Classic+ zones?
---
Don't ever let anybody tell you to try an easier game because you aren't playing up to their standards. You're paying to play wow, remember that. Warlock's rotation isn't overly complicated in any PvE content, and you will learn a lot of the class by leveling up to 60 in the game. 
---
This is what most people, who never played classic, fail to realize. You get very invested in your character's power growth from 1-60 and beyond. I guarantee that you won't feel overwhelmed at 60, despite having 5 bars of skills. You will run into situations that require you to utilize every skill at least once while leveling. WoW's leveling, despite taking a bit of time if you're new, is one of the most rewarding in terms of actually feeling your character's growth with your own.
---
Yup. I navigated orgrimmar via the mini map. Looked down most of the time.
---
Paladins are best healers in the game in pvp and pve. Neither class has raid-capable off-specs, but Elemental is good in pvp. Prot can tank 5-mans well. Not sure how you see Shaman as better.
---
You don't like the "challenge" of having a level 60 show up and kill you when you're questing at level 30?  A lot of people here would think you're crazy for disliking that, lol.
---
In all seriousness though, you should talk to your friends about it and let them know your concerns.  One important thing you might not have realized is that, being higher level, they can power level you through some dungeons (there are specific techniques that make this pretty effective) which avoid the open world all together.
---
But if my friends wanted to switch to a PvP server I'd tell them they were crazy and I'm sticking with a Normal server...
---
I don't know about TBC, but I played a lot in WotLK and Cata and I never felt that I had to do something I don't like.
---
There were badgers in WotLK. If you are raider, they were not necessary, because gear is bad. But if you're catching up, I think you had to run something like 7 dungeons per week which is not that bad, especially because I liked those dungeons. And Hodirs. Well, those 3 weeks of Hodir farm is all that I hated about WotLK. Not fun, but does not last long.
---
I don't remember anything bad about Cataclysm. I never felt that I must do something. Again, I was raider, so that's about it. May be casual players had to do boring things, I don't know.
---
Now Pandaria came and I left the game because I was forced to do abysmal number of dailies for some coins. I hated it so much that I just left WoW for few years. I returned in Legion and that was just another game, full of things I hated but felt necessary to do. People hate BfA, but they actually fixed that and I did not farm a single thing in BfA.
---
Okay here's the thing, warrior leveling is only a chore when the warrior isnt decently geared (granted it is most of the leveling process). 
---
But Leveling a warrior with full SM gear is juicy!
---
Are you young? Are you just used to games in beta being free to access by everyone? 
---
Just because you’re used to every game being in beta being open to everyone doesn’t mean that’s how it should work. 
---
This isn’t Pubg or Arma where the game is in testing for years.
---
Basically those kind of minmaxers who rush to 60 do it through account sharing, so they're basically breaking the EULA just to get server firsts.
---
Also, given the chaos surrounding launch, it won't be like a nice controlled environment like starting on a fairly new pserver. Even if they pussy it up and go PvE server it will still be chaotic and unpredictable.
---
pserver knowledge is not strictly speaking applicable to vanilla
---
Man that sounds incredible honestly. I would love to work abroad for a little while! I've always wanted to go to Japan!
---
You’re looking forward to leveling but also want to struggle on hogger?
---
The game isn’t as hard as you think.
---
Yeah that’s some BS
---
It was fun while it lasted man lol
---
The persona of the narrator was supposed to be weird, because I'm a weird guy, too.
---
It's pretty strong but IMO you need a lot of dmg gear as the mage because the paladin doesn't contribute a lot of his own deeps.
---
Priest can be better as a duo early because of their damage alongside the offensive dispel and fear, but paladin mage is nothing to scoff at.

Viable actually means functional. Does it function? Yes. Is it awkward as clunk? You bet. But it’s viable.

You trying to pin an arbitrary percent difference in performance is silly and disingenuous.

Our scouts in Ashenvale have reported a recent bolster in the Night Elf stronghold there.  When seeking more information the scouts disappear.  Go there and discover what they are up to.

If anybody's looking for a game to fill their time with leading up to classic I would 100% recommend Escape from Butcher Bay if you're looking for a decently challenging single player experience.

---
Low effort dawg.
---
The argument isn’t what matters more when comparing skill to traits but the fact that at some point those traits matter. 
---
People can f up a situation and those passive traits can save them if that’s the difference between a kill and someone living within a thread of hp in PvP. It could also be the difference in Mythic raiding, a passive shield could be the difference as well. If you don’t have them because you don’t enjoy the content that leads to getting them at a reasonable pace you are at a disadvantage. They matter even if it’s not by much because the effects still remain. 
---
I raid in a 9/9m guild, I push high end m+, and am a 2500 arena/rbg player. I have some experience with this. I want to focus on those things and not grind ap each and every day. Even doing 4 world quests is a damn chore but if I could pick when to focus on them I’d be much happier. If I don’t grind out the quests and islands every day I fall behind. That’s a fact.
---
The entire group needs to revolve around a paladin tank.  DPS needs to hold back, healer needs to monitor their threat, slow pulls overall.
---
At the end of the day, why put people through the hassle?  If bandaging didn’t have a debuff, you could run 5 mans without a healer, and have a perfect rotation of 4 DPS taking turns bandaging the tank.  But then you could just skip all that bullshit and bring a healer.
---
I don't know about him very much, just thought he could be useful to advertise the project to get more people into it. So does this gets downvoted so much because of him or is the video so bad, or both?

Its obviously a photography

I don’t think you do recall. You can solo hogger on classic/vanilla. You have your rose tinted goggles a little too tight.

Lol...

They literally had a server message saying that the servers are not being stressed enough and they were shutting some down to stress the remaining ones more.

You can find screenshots for it on reddit. So he's not wrong at all

It's not about hardcore players. If you're playing hardcore, you have to make sacrifices. It's about casual players who are forced to play hardcore.

Can you farm first few bosses for 5 years and eventually beat the Naxx?
---
Read the rules
---
Yeah if you raid, it easily will become like a job to log in. HOWEVER, if you get to the point where you are raiding, you probably feel invested in it for social reasons as well as character progression. A lot of times when I raided I wasn't terribly concerned with getting gear because I also want my guildies to get gear and we can all get collectively stronger. But when AQ comes out, every day that you're not raiding, you'll most likely feel obligated to log in on off days (unless you stockpiled lots of mats/money for mats)
---
Agree so much. In a dungeon my role as a tank is to protect the healer first and foremost. 
---
It’s faster and safer to let a bad dps die and Rez if wanted than get into a fight with no mana or rage and risk everyone dying.
---
Lots of incorrect info here. Items will be in their 1.12 state.
---
I did too... but I also know that Vanilla and Classic are two different monsters.  Vanilla was like the Wild West. It was a lot of testing and guessing our way through the content.  And more importantly we didn't know what was on the road ahead of us.  So being in full plate made sense for that unknown new content.  Trust me I fully agree that Paladins in full plate can do all of the vanilla content.  I've been there, done that.  But for many who come from private servers and those who will be classic raiders there is a huge difference between doing the content and doing the content well.  Unfortunately full plate isn't doing the content well.
---
I don’t understand what’s wrong with posting this it’s a good way to play classic on the go for people who have little time to play like me?
---
You vs the painting she tells you not to worry about
---
I don’t think any of them do to the same extent as the long braids for dwarf ladies. 😄
---
FWIW I don’t mean any offense and I want to believe you. And I definitely don’t think you are lying or anything.
---
That's not correct. If you're talking about emissary quests, you have 3 days to do them, so you can log every 3-rd day and not miss anything. And world quests are almost infinite, you can spend hours completing them (well, they are finite, but if you did them all, that's not really healthy).
---
Nemesis head with felheart shoulders for warlocks - You don’t need much else to complement that set
---
&gt;  Raiding basically was a career.
---
Maybe if you're a melee DPS going full tryhard and spending 10 hours per week farming consumes for raids.
---
On a Paladin, I cleared the entirety of Vanilla raid content raiding 2 nights per week (4 hours each) and maybe putting in 2-3 hours of raid prep per week. (consumes and world buffs)
---
ORCED
---
No. It's literally just casting Shadowbolt. You MIGHT get a curse assigned to you, but that's it. Also, how are u including soul stones in a rotation...?
---
Yeah honestly, cosmetic shop goes directly against classic WoW, I can hope it will never happen, I am more then happy to pay blizz $15 a month for the foreseeable future as long as they don't get greedy
---
Reaching 16-17% hit as warlock is Almost impossible, 10% hit from gear is a great number to shoot for which rarely gets a miss on raid bosses
---
I have been debating on rolling Pally.
---
Once more: stop tunnel-visioning on raiding. There's more to the game than raiding. Stop assuming that specs can ONLY be healers, tanks, or damage dealers. There are reasons to do things with classes that aren't strictly those roles. Like I said the only *actual* problem is that Blizzard didn't communicate these things clearly.
---
-and there are plenty of threads to make Undead Paladins if Blizz wanted them.
---
Take [Robes of the Exalted](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346), it's literally 3x better than [Plate of the Shaman King](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13168) for healing output, which is what Paladins need since they're already the most mana efficient healers in the game. They just want more throughput.
---
Yes, to pioneer means to push something new forward extensively, not necessarily to be the very first.
---
From Merriam-Webster: "A person who begins or helps develop something new and prepares the way for others to follow"
---
Fortnite may not have been the very first battle royale, but they were among the first and definitely pushed the genre further than the other few that were out at the time.
---
Gold sinks (things that remove gold from the economy / things that in general you give NPCs gold for) combat the effects of inflation, which is what your previous post is about. 
---
PLEX-type items only move currency between players. It doesn't add or remove significant amounts of gold from the system, except in auction fees.
---
She really isn't about just being Hot. It's her kinda hot+geeky+quirky+great sense of humor that people love.
---
Back in Vanilla, Alliance guilds were almost universally getting world firsts. But that's not the point - for the average raiding guild, having a greatly increased threat cap and a healer with bottomless mana far outstrips WF totem and chain heal.
---
You wouldn’t also happen to live in a society?
---
Funnily, in super hardcore guilds the duties of a Shaman move from healing further towards utility and damage. Like Nightfall, having one ele Shaman etc.
---
Are they stronger than dps classes? Unlikely. But encounters require very different amounts of healing and a shaman can change gears unlike a hunter.
---
I heard that Asmon/Esfand have one coming soon.
---
Also the beta server is dead for a handful of reasons.
---
No new invites have gone out so there are no new players to replace the ones who have stopped (like myself). This also causes the low level zones to be empty since the already small population is already leveled up.
---
They are testing layering so the few people playing are being divided into layers for the sake of testing so it feels very barren.
---
Also, its a beta.. it's got a short time left before all that progress is gone and unless you are absolutely bored out of your mind and have no time consuming responsibilities then it's hard to justify the time commitment it takes to push the level cap or get item upgrades that you will probably not use anyway.
---
I personally stopped because I think I got the idea of what to expect in Classic, I reported all the bugs I encountered and I want to do other things, like socialize, for the next two months before I lock myself in for god knows how long.
---
Can we just take this down...
---
There was like over 20 servers dude and it was a stress test. No one is going to log in for a few hours to stress test a game. People want to play the game. 
---
But sure. Keep saying wow is dead. It’s been over a decade of hearing it. Let’s keep it going.
---
Probably just a general dislike of streamers
---
I loved everything vanilla until it got to raiding. It seems fun but holy fuck, all the consumables and wayyyy too fucking much gold. My guild wanted me to spend like 500g on like 3 pieces of gear and i quit, i play the game to have fun. Ill find a guild that wants to enjoy the game or pug raids way later that other people and maybe get gear while the next tier is out. I dont care, and most people with vanilla/ private server experience from what I've seen seem to feel the same, granted the hardcore raiders are definitely part of it too, most people are hindering their experience by not just doing what you want.
---
I mean the stress test opened at 2pm PST which is 5pm EST. Most people are at work at that time plus EU was not invited to the stress test. They had like 15 servers opened and closed down a lot because ....obviously people are working. To say the stress was dead was blatantly wrong because come 7-10EST every server was packed.
---
Why?
---
How do you know how many hours I'll use it for? Or how big an upgrade it is?
---
Let's assume however it is big, and it is many hours. This applies to both BoE and BoP. Money is also relative, so if you have 6000g in the bank, an extra 3g is worth less than someon who has 1g in the bank. Etc etc.
---
I understand it all, the point is there's so many variables, beyond what I even mentioned. To the point where its completely subjective. Whereas my version is objective. If the item is an upgrade and you're gonna use, need. If it isn't, greed.
---
That's why need/greed was even a thing.
---
Don't pretend you don't know
---
It's true and you should say it.
---
Great painting but we all know that no Horde city can top the Alliance you scum!
---
Using 4 charges of mana oil and sticking it on the auction house.  Sells every time
---
I knew it was bullshit and I checked anyway..
---
OK what is this I tri six value? How many stats so I need per gold and why?
---
[Glad I could make it, Arthas.](https://youtu.be/7gCo8fajC7o)
---
That's not the issue. With all respect, seriously, the issue is that simply linking something, especially to another reddit thread, where an issue is being discussed, doesnt add content to this subreddit. It's called low effort posting.
---
You can’t. Just make a macro and press to switch
---
Thanks, North!
---
Yes. See my post above about soloing it at 11.
---
You can only have 1 tracking at a time, yes it has been confirmed.
---
It's definitely in the beta I'm wearing a piece of shadow wrath
---
Ya. This sure doesn't look good.
---
This would be way more appropriate for Sylvanas' Horde.
---
I’m simply sharing something I found helpful?
---
May the stars guide you.
---
The part where it is acceptable to need something that gives +1 stat upgrade, but could be vendored for 10g or sharded. What if it is a sidegrade or for offspec, and wouldn't even help their dps/main role?  Why is it alright to say that 1 stat per 10g is more valuable for you than the 21 frost spell power for 500g of a Freezing band to the mage of the party? 
---
You could also argue that while you're doing the dungeon and while it is sitting in the AH, that freezing ring is similarly going to waste in the same way that gear that isn't getting worn and is just getting vendored is going to waste.
---
What about if a boe green that doesn't vendor for much drops, but could replace an under leveled piece of equipment for someone in the group and be a huge upgrade. Does everyone roll on it because its a boe? Clearly there is some line being drawn in the sand. Is it boe blues? Is it boe epics? Is it twink items of high value? 
---
Best to talk about it with the group before you start the run, because it really isn't so simple
---
Either way I feel they're making the game a huge disservice by letting the beta stagnate and die out rather than just closing it for a while or keeping a decent population on it so the product can be properly tested before flopping on release. 
---
This beta has clearly been about advertisement  just as much as testing, if not more. It'd be nice to see the game do well.
---
Also I don't think there are a ton of people under 25 on this sub
---
Hey whatever "turns him on" i guess.
---
? 
---
I'm well aware his joke was about ironforge being the greatest city but he's praising the art as if op was an artist or some shit, had to correct.
---
You have to take into account the value of the item. You can't just apply a blanket rule to a situation that requires nuance.
---
You pretending people don't think the same as I do when they ask "is X viable" is silly and disingenuous.
---
At this point you'd call a holy priest spamming smite "viable dps", cause hey, it functions, it deals damage.
---
Seems like something that would fall under the "low droprate items" note that OP put.
---
Getting the thing to drop is RNG enough, then you have a 1 in 16(?) chance of it rolling the proper "of ___ wrath" that you need.
---
blizzard could make murlocs get dumped in a pile of kajamite and develop a cure for old god corruption, but it still follows the established basis of the lore (kajamite granting increased intellect, possibly granting more based on how much is consumed). the light is a variable amount of hot metal, and shadow is a variable amount of solid ice. they're fundamentally at odds with one another, and while there is an equilibrum that you can find temporily, itd be perpetual agony for the people involved. hence my saying in another comment that itd be an interesting dynamic to have a 'council' of sorts of undead that have the necessary will and fortitude to become like sir zelizek, but far too few to (reasonably) justify a playable race.
---
of course if blizzard wants it theyll get it, im just saying that it would further cheapen what good lore they have left

I did Ogrila but 90% because I just loved the Simon game with the crystals, I never got any of the other rep mounts or anything though but I also didnt feel forced too.

Dalies in TBC were not over powered gear, I never felt I needed to do them to advance as opposed to retail's slot machine titanforge bullshit. If you killed youself in TBC for the mounts and tabards, that shits on you, there 100% was no reason to do them other than they gave you something to kill time with.

Their damage is great but they have down time

I'd like to go gnome or dwarf rogue, but want to level up in teldrassil for darnassus rep gains. on private servers, the first class quest wasn't available there (on dwarf). do i need to do the class quests in the starter zone for my character's race? how are things working in beta vs pserver for this?
---
the difference is in vanilla you can literally nonstop marathon it day one or do it totally piecemeal over the course of months. retail you do it on blizzards given timeline (1 quest a day or w/e it is) or you fall behind the pack. Easier to keep up, impossible to just "grind out"
---
I'll still prob roll a rogue, not sure how solo pvp is on war but at least rogues have the stealth
---
How the fuck do you know the value of an item?
---
The AH value fluctuates over time and the value to an individual player also fluctuates based on what they already have and how often they play.
---
 RemindMe! 2 months

It’ll be that. Small and healthy. It’ll be a niche game that appeals to a small section of the MMO community.

I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but...
---
I think Blizzard's "invite streamers only" for marketing idea kind of backfired here. We all got to live vicariously through them for 40 levels, and essentially "spoil" the Classic experience through them. The best thing you could have done is avoid watching the streams. For those who have... the magic is gone and many have lost the feels. This has resulted in less people watching the streams, the viewer count going down, and - since this is their job/what pays the bills - the streamers themselves have lost interest and are moving on to other games.
---
Both. Alliance are the clear winners in PvE. and also pull ahead in organised PvP.
---
Lol you’re wrong, just stop.
---
You want to use /equipslot 16 and /equipslot 17.  I think those are the numbers, someone may be able to confirm.
---
I glad to read what your wrote, i feel the same.
---
&gt; Need and greed are supposed to be different, rolling on a BoE that you're going to sell is greed. No matter what the quality of the item, need should be used if and only if you intend to use the item as an immediate upgrade
---
I think you are making the mistake of confusing designer intent with concrete reality. The game mechanics are not like the Bible to literalist Christians, you are not meant to read them with the assumption that the author was divinely inspired.
---
If everyone agrees the best use of the system is to all Need on valuable BoEs, it is nonsensical to respond "Need and Greed are *supposed to be different*", because what is supposed to be is an irrelevant figment of your imagination. All that matters is the outcome, and the best outcome results from everyone Needing on valuable BoEs.
---
Pretty sure huhu has high resistance to magic in general.
---
The number of instances those traits are what prevents a wipe (or loss in pvp) are very few. As a mythic raider, you should well know that a majority of a time when a player dies, it’s by a rather large deficit. You generally die from a hit 10s or 100s of thousands greater than your hp. You’ll rarely be saved by a shield of a few thousand. You should KNOW this is true from your own personal experience.
---
Those defensive traits are meant to be minor character progression. A reward for continuing to gain AP beyond the first few rings of traits that have a significant impact on performance. They aren’t designed to be things you grind out and burn yourself out on. It’s unnecessary for a vast majority of the player, even most of the 9/9m guilds. People are just unable or unwilling to put perspective on the issue of AP.
---
omg yes?!
---
You shouldn't be using soul fire in raids unless you guys are pre casting on mobs before pulls (naxx mainly). Searing pain is a legitimate DPS increase in raids, if you are standing max range you can cast shadowbolt followed by a searing pain, and since sb has a such a slow projectile speed both spells will hit at the exact same time. This useful for a DPS increase when a mob/boss is at too low health for 2 shadowbolts to connect. Learned this on pservers and used it all the time.
---
I clearly didn't communicate this perfectly because a couple of people haven been confused.
---
I'm not saying the items will be in their non 1.12 states- I'm saying that mage benefits from having them in their 1.12 states because of how bad earlier states are for specific items.
---
any use is good, good use is goodgood.
---
They've already been greedy with Classic not being it's own cheaper sub, having an active subscription to  have a chance at closed beta, needing a sub to stress test it and I'm certain the same will be for open beta, then having to re-sub before Launch to reserve names. They're going to milk this for all it's worth and if you think they won't slap up old mounts/pets in the cash shop that are classic exclusive, you're kidding yourself.

In vanilla I used:

/run if n~= 1 then CastSpellByName("Find Minerals") n=1 else CastSpellByName("Find Herbs") n=0 end

/Castsequence "Find Minerals", "Find Herbs"
---
I have to imagine one or the other will work, though I don't have beta.  Put it on mouse scroll or Q or something and get used to activating it every couple of seconds.
---
Gnome lock is pretty badass and kind of fits in with the  tinkerer...they just tinker with dark magic. 
---
If you go horde the options are good and good-er.
---
Sorry that's complete nonsense. Need rolling on something you can't use, that isn't an upgrade,  or that isn't equipped immediately to prove they're not going to sell it, is called *ninja looting*. And you will called a ninja looter, as you should be. And people will stop groping with you, as they should.
---
This is all more relevant to raids because like we've said UBRS can be tanked in whatever.
---
**On defense**
---
It's an easy mistake to make, I know since I made it myself, but gearing for defense is a noob trap. Most of what defense is good for is stopping raid bosses and some special hard hitting trash from critting you. However, if you have 1 point in imp shield block, you can keep that up 100% of the time vs one target. Shield block pushes  both crits and crushing blows off the attack table. So in the end defense is virtually useless because the only time you care about it shield block can do it's job better. 
---
\*Block % is pretty meh against bosses for the same reason.
---
**More on gear**
---
As a tank,  most of the time you're fighting to keep threat and your gear should reflect that.
---
Focus on stamina and anything that will help your threat. Agility is your friend, 20agi=1crit.
---
A couple items you had listed are from later patches you can check them on  [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/)
---
You'd take agility or crusader over strength on your weapon. Which one comes down to personal preference.
---
Since we know how lackluster defense is now, we don't need core armor kits
---
100hp on chest

Your talents [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZxmZEwz0cMdVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZxmZEwz0cMdVo) 
---
Here's points I would criticize:
---
Booming voice is a pvp talent for unstealthing rogues, you'll miss the crit from cruelty in pve.
---
Unbridled wrath is not that great when not dual wielding. We have better places to spend our points.
---
Anticipation adds def skill which we know from above is useless.
---
No imp shield block. We need 1 point in it to get the 2nd block and block boss attacks 100% of the time.
---
No Defiance. You're just straight up gonna need it.
---
Here's the heart and soul of any tank build  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZZxfzox](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZZxfzox) 
---
Last stand, imp shield block, and 5/5 defiance for threat.
---
We can go a few different ways from here. Toughness/ImpRevenge/ImpTaunt/ImpSunder/ImpSW are all valid choices to get you to one handed weapon spec.
---

---
suboptimal pvp arms/tank combo build  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxdAboxzZxfzoe](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxdAboxzZxfzoe) 
---
Warrior's pretty nice because when you go prot or pvp spec you get a lot of options.
---
Again, you don't need any particular spec to do dungeons / UBRS. Consumables like grenades for aoe threat will help you more than any choice of talents.
---
I say that, but with a little gear 2h arms might be best for dungeons with a good healer. Sweeping strikes and cleave your way through to be tank and #1 dps. Would work with the pvp arms/tank combo build. ahahaha
---
Seriously? When I played in Cata it was a pretty straightforward system. Earn points in BGs, spend those points on gear from the vendor. 
---
How does it work now??
---
I knew it looked really familiar seeing as the angle is so odd...
---
Not really. A decent 2005 graphics card could do that easily. Even my garbage 2002 PC was outputting 1024x768 without issues.
---
&gt; Dailies that are the sole gate for a faction's reputation are probably the worst example of this, and probably the worst thing put into the game.
---
I don't know ... I despise the fucking assaults / invasions way more. They give much better rewards in BFA than shitty daily quests, occur for only few hours a day. And good luck once they start cycling 2am-7am your time zone.
---
Lol ok. If you think classic is going to flop on release because people didn’t get invited to beta then go ahead and think that. 
---
People arnt going to play the beta for a game nonstop weeks before it releases. 
---
If you expected the hype on beta to increase over the coarse of 3 months then Idk what to say hahah
---
Blessing of Kings.
---
Bullshit. I played Vanilla. Anyone who rolled need on something they can't use, and that they equip immediately...is ninja looting. And you WILL get called out for it.
---
Then you put him on a black list and shout his name in lfg chat :)
---
that’s a spicy meatball
---
Doesn’t apply to BoE’s. Sorry not sorry.
---
The gear available before naxx isn't strong enough to get through naxx itself without heavy consumes.
---
Depends, most of the pre raid bis gear is cloth
---
That’s the struggle you want in a game? The struggle where 1 level means you don’t need anyone’s help anymore? 
---
I mean sure. I guess that’s a good struggle to want. Outlevel everything so you never have to group up is a struggle.
---
Heck I'll feel obligated to log off every now and then to get that rest xp.
---
I'd say a year in at the most. Trickle in with server xfers, name changes, faction changes first, then toss in some old mounts. Perhaps why they're so adamant to not have the unarmored epic mounts in game is so it's an option when the cash shop goes live. A cash shop will happen, as that's how all of Blizz's games gets most of their revenue.
---
&gt; If everyone agrees the best use of the system is to all Need on valuable BoEs
---
Not only is it not close to everyone but thats an argument to the people which is a logical fallacy.
---
You I like. Too bad more people aren't like you.
---
I remember around BC everyone was rolling need on everything too, but in classic on my server that wasn't the case, so about the same.
---
You resort to being hyperbolic, and leave out critical points of my comment. Did it from the start. Don’t cherry pick context to suit your needs, you aren’t the media. Use the entirety.
---
Nope, I definitely agree with you there.
---
Retaining the old playerbase is fine, but expanding it is even better.
---
I'd imagine the best way to do that would be to attract younger generations, which is often done by having the games high up on twitch these days.
---
Oh it sure as hell does/did. 
---
You claim to be worried about ninja looting... **but you're literally the ninja looter here**.
---
YOU'RE the problem.
---
It’s totally possible to get it at 40.
---
All you need is an entire guild to farm you cloth, and to buy out anything and everything that appears on the AH. Simple as pie right? ^^^^^right?
---
&gt; You're telling me your Warriors, Paladins, Priests and Shamans are ALL going to be beating that record?
---
&gt; That's Noon on Friday if you don't sleep, get up from your desk, lift your hand up off the mouse or keyboard to scratch your nose......
---
No, it's about 8 hours a shift for a team of 3, which I mentioned already and you just ignored.
---
For the rest of us, it's 100 hours /played over ~170 hours. That's 10 hours a day to sleep and do whatever.
---
get that fucking Palomino horse. It's been on my mind since I was a kid and then I resubbed during Cata, saved money and cried realizing it was gone..
---
That's right.  [Here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Making_a_macro) is a good reference.
---
    /equipslot [stance:1/2] 17 something; [stance:3] 17 somethingelse
---
I think something like that is what you want to look into.
---
This is so true. Almost all players will say atleast once that they should have been a certain class because they got full tier sets before anyone else got anything. I think we got warlock gloves like 24 raids straight once
---
Death ray cant backfire afaik. It does damage to you as well everytime you use it, but it doesnt crit you. It just has a big swing on its dmg roll so sometimes you crit for 2k sometimes 10k. 
---
The mitigation is sometimes not v useful but if you need to stall for a cd ( like surviving your freedom after you get hit hard) you can switch def stance and shield block, thunderclap can be quite nice when they are trying to burst , interrupts and disarms are obviously great. 
---
Def stance has saved me from a hammer letting me get an intercept off for example.
---
I would have loved to see it breathe life into the genre again.
---
Sounds about right to me.
---
It DOES add gold to the system. The ability for players to trade gold for real money means players will extract more gold from the game. That is how supply and demand works.
---
I’m not going to keep reexplaining this.
---
We've clocked our times on every stress test. And we're purposefully filling our test bed server with bots to mimic launch day issues. The key is getting ahead of the spergs. Our goal is level 30 within the first 24 hours and then coast by ourselves from there. And no, we won't be going PVE.
---
nah
---
Yes but what makes you think these elements are not in wow? Weekly raid resets etc. Plenty of fear of missing out.
---
Ridicumore?
---
If you miss a day of doing WQs right now, you will lose out on rep for the Mechagon/Nazjatar/Bodyguard factions and will get there a day later than other people (flying and raid unlock, Nazjatar questline in general). You will have less Prismatic Manapearls to potentially upgrade the Benthic armor. If you lose a day of doing all the Azerite rewarding WQs, you will be a day behind on reaching level 55 and getting an additional minor essence.  
---
8.2 really showed me how much I hate this system of daily quests, in classic you can just decide to hardcore grind for X on the weekend, and no ones stopping you.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'll keep needing BoE drops as I have since 2005.
---
I think the one of the best examples of the shift in design philosophies is the Winterspring Frostsaber. 
---
Back in vanilla it was a long grind that involved farming materials from enemies in the zone, and then turning them into a REPEATABLE quest for TINY amounts of rep.  It took a long time and only very dedicated players took the time to grind it out.  
---
At some point years later, Blizz changed the rep grind to a series of DAILY quests.  You would pick up the quest for the day, complete it, and turn it in for a LARGE chunk of rep. But that was it, once you did the quest, there was nothing else to do for the rep that day. You just had to wait until the next day, and do the the next daily. 
---
Now, BOTH  systems required the player to do something over a long period of time. And then at the end, they were rewarded with the mount.  
---
Ex:  If a player decided they wanted that mount, in both cases, they wouldn’t receive the reward for a few months.  But i feel like the difference between the systems is huge. 
---
With the NEWER system, if you were busy IRL and missed a day, you were PERMANENTLY one day behind, with no possible way to make up for the missed day and catch back up.  This is is what causes players to feel like they are obligated to log on. Cause if you missed a few days here or there, thats it, you would be forever and always a few days behind. 
---
With the OLDER system. If you were busy and missed a day,  you could log on later, double down and farm extra hard to make up for the lost time, and essentially catch back up.  Because it was repeatable, rather than daily. 
---
BOTH systems required players to wait a long time for their reward,  but  the the way in which you spend that time in game working towards that reward, is vastly different.
---
I never denied that the occurrences are not often but they happen and they matter. My experience teaches me that it all matters. Clearly some things more than others. I don’t want to grind AP at all. It’s a stupid mechanic and the fact that it does provide benefits to those who grind it means in a competitive scenario, even if it’s not often, it still matters. Especially in PvP. AP is nothing more than a mechanic to get people to log in every day. There’s no sugar coating it. We probably won’t see eye to eye on the issue but thanks for the chat.
---
When did I claim to be worried?
---
Looks like Miks scrolling battle text? Not sure though.
---
&gt; You can solo hogger on classic/vanilla.
---
That's good to know.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to take him at 60.
---
That doesn’t look like Capital City circa 30 years ago...
---
Get pranked!
---
This dude is on my man crush list and I can never look at him the same.
---
Then me and a large portion of the playerbase us gone, which is fine  I guess, what they are doing by sure seems to be working in retail *sarcasm*
---
How many players stuck remotes in thier asses when thier favorite PS was shutdown
---
This is false.
---
First Onyxia kill - Horde
---
First MC boss kill - Horde
---
First Ragnaros kill - Horde
---
First BWL boss kill - Horde
---
First Vael-the-guild-killer kill - Horde
---
Yeah, Alliance got Nefarian.
---
First C'thun kill - Horde
---
First Kel'thuzad kill - Horde.
---
Of the 5 40-man raids in Vanilla, Horde got world first clears in all but one of them. https://www.method.gg/raid-history/vanilla
---
That's fine. And you'll keep getting added to ignore lists, like you surely have, since 2005. 
---
"Need" is when you actually *need* something. It's sad that people actually **need** this explained to them.
---
And wow tokens are basically a $20 sub so. So a sub is still a sub.
---
I see humans and orcs and undead all together....This isn't from 2006 it's prob from a private server.
---
What I don't understand is how they can keep you from just buying the wow token using your Retail gold and using the time to play Classic. Is it the buying or the selling of the WoW tokens that destroys  the economy?
---
I'm in the market for a new phone. Would like to play WoW on it. What would people recomend?
---
Not seeing what is probably the biggest reason.  They don't want people getting bored of the game before it's even out.  It's a long grind and many people will quit before they even hit 30.
---
You're worried people will ninja, so you roll need to prevent them doing so yeah?
---
Guy didn’t even say anything, so you feeling guilty just because? Needing a boe you fully intend to equip is usually ok.
---
it's basically an epic mount so it values more than just a pick up and wear it. so also an upgrade for everyone in that case. they are a bad example for that because an epic mount is huge in terms of pvp
---
Hell yeah. This is why I quit during WotLK the first time. Dailies became a Job Simulator.
---
I know what they are...
---
The point is there is there is a lot of repetitive mindless grinding in this game
---
I mean the guy wants to go back where hogger was difficult then immediately says how easy it was.
---
What was his weapon progression like? You can buy vendor guns up to level 31 but past that what does he choose to use?
---
I ran legion with a 2012mbp with 4g ram, platter drive and an integrated chip without issue. I think you’ll be just fine. 
---
Ps-I do occasionally use it to run retail, but have added an ssd and 16g ram. Runs just fine for world and pvp, drops a bit below 30 fps in raids if I’m melee on a heavy particle effect  fight, but ok for ranged or healing.
---
Not quite what I meant by flopping. Release is still going to be massive regardless, no doubt.
---
It could however be an absolute shitstorm of queues, latency, bugs and issues with layering and whatnot that probably could have been mitigated if the game had been tested more thoroughly beforehand.
---
What if the entire first phase turns out to be nothing but terrible performance?
---
I think this launch is going to be incredibly important.
---
Missed the part about "being proud" of it? Cause it was something you don't really do easily.
---
I think this has gone on long enough.
---
You've followed all the rules of Reddit and this sub, just ignore the trolls.
---
Have you looked into the [ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/) addon for WoW? I don't know if they have support for your device, but they're making a Classic version. It completely changes the game's UI and makes it so controller pad friendly.
---
For someone who goes on about logical fallacies, you are not very good at parsing if-then arguments.
---
You don't need to learn how to do anything. I use linux and windows on a daily basis. If you can use ubuntu 14.04 or above, you can use windows.
---
Lol this and that really fat guy freaking out were funny, although fake. Francis or something.
---
Ever farm these?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=21186
---
Cross-posting is exactly what he should do in this case. Read the Reddit guidelines.
---
Sure you are, buddy. You're already willing to drop 15 a months on an old game port instead of playing on a private server for free, but a cash shop existing is *too far?*
---
If it was up to me and the choice was between Classic, current retail and WoW 2.0 I would play WoW 2.0 as sooner or later I would get tired of the lack of content in Classic. But that won't stop me from playing it in the meantime :)
---
Personally think this would be the best way forward, adding content and quality of life changes that has no impact on game play or design and so forth while staying true to the things that made Vanilla WoW what it is/was.
---
Now I haven't played since WotLK and to be honest that was the last time WoW actually felt like WoW to me, it was watered down already but not to the point beyond all recognition but some people want TBC and WotLK as they were so that should be added as well. To each their own.
---
Yes i'm sure german roleplay randoms went ahead and counted all the players on the servers.
---
It's a fact that only the 3 i named remained big servers towards the end of vanilla.
---
Cata was secretly great for accessible pvp, you could go the long route and grind gear through random bgs, but the guy would earned his earlier in the arena would still wreck you because/ if he was a better player
---
Ffxiv is the new flagship. If recent rumors are to be believed its overtaken WoW in subs
---
That was a fun movie, also the redhead who played Ygritte in game of thrones was in it
---
Well I am used to the itemisation of private servers ehich is a bit different and it also depends on what phase we are in. 
---
Speaking for warlocks the bloodvine set alone will run you about 300g-400g + maybe 200g extra for the goggles if you are an engineer, the shadow damage rings are about 150g-200g each and not unique (not BiS in BWL/ZG either), then there are a wealth of shadow wrath items which are just greens with +shadow damage on them. The most notable are the wands which I believe can have up to 21 or 23 damage and they usually go for thousands of gold. Yes, thousands, especially the mage and priest wands.
---
The Rockfury Bracers are from the AQ related quests in Silithus and cost about 200-250g. You can also invest the gold into the scepter quest which in its entirety will cost about 1000-1500g depending on competition. Especially druids and priests do this because the dagger is super strong. 
---
Then there are the Silithus windstone items, like the blue shoulders of sorcery are really strong, especially if you're in a guild that doesn't reliably kill many bosses in AQ40. I've seen them from 150-400g. You can also buy the epic BoPs in gbid runs but I don't think there are any good for warlocks, there's a good healer neck and a shield iirc.
---
Precision is nice, and ultimately there is nothing else worthwhile to put points into on that tier.  
---
Redoubt is noticable damage redux against fast hitting things like pets and rogues.  Also it can block certain debuffs that have a damage value component like gouge and hamstring.  
---
I never found imp lay on hands that great, and IMO you want to get as many points into imp hoj as possible, so my spec usually looks more like : 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgktVGp0Mh
---
I'm very good at it. If need, then need. If greed, then greed. What more do you need to form deduction and this an if-then argument?
---
Unless of course you're talking complete bollocks and just hoping I won't call you on it.
---
Not a difficult feat at this point though with retail numbers supposedly dipping below a million.
---
Or just make a nice humanized AHK script.
---
You'll need skinning for DM:N Dog farm
---
Feral druids are strong levelers. I would put them at B tier, behind the pet classes ( hunter and warlock ). They have perfectly good damage, their heals and innervates give them plenty of up time, and they have a lot of tools to deal with sticky situations (bear form, travel form, etc). 
---
Definitely higher than warriors and paladins in a solo leveling setting.
---
I wanted to complete tier 2 as a mage in OG Vanilla and I got it by the time we killed C'thun. Most people also went for tier sets for their bonuses I don't remember a lot of people trying to aim for a BiS list. People considered tier sets to be really good when in reality they aren't exactly the best for PvE.
---
I know that guy!
---
Would’ve payed to experience that, sounds awesome
---
Lol I would’ve been disappointed if he played anything else
---
I don’t remember shit about classic. You know why? Cause it was 13 years ago. Doesn’t mean I wasn’t grinding my ass in burning steppes for my final few levels. I’ll be a noob with you.
---
Jeez what’s up with all the doom and gloom on this damn Reddit man. 
---
It’s a beta it’s for testing purposes. WoW is a 15 year old game ....what kind of hype are you expecting out of a beta for this type of game? If you play retail - you’ll likely try classic. If you played vanilla - you’ll likely play classic. You think there are that many people interested in playing MMOs that have not HEARD of WoW?!
---
The game is going to be fine dude regardless of how many people are on the beta. Blizzard knows what they are doing, I’m sure they are getting EXACTLY what they need from the beta which is why more people are not being invited. 
---
To think you have some insider knowledge into the MMORPG genre that blizzard, the leader in the genre for 15 years, doesn’t have....is honestly laughable man.
---
Quit getting your panties in a bunch. It’ll be fine
---
You know how you think about something one way until you actually experience it and then you question whether or not it was the right call? It's just one of those situations. I don't think I was 'wrong' but I wanted everyone's opinion.
---
Ya I've never heard of that and I've played since basically day 1. Maybe before people realized these BoEs were that valuable, but after people realized they were important (twink, gold, etc) they most certainly didn't just give them away. Especially now that everyone knows BoEs value, I highly doubt people will be rolling and wearing them.
---
Nice straw man there.
---
&gt;&gt; They skip the bridge and take the backdoor.
---
&gt;And in more modern clients, this jump skip has been fixed. Since we are playing on the legion client, it won't exist.
---
&gt;And the only reason why horde stood a chance in AV, was because of being able to skip the bridge which was a deathtrap.
---
Oh that will absolutely kill the only advantage Horde has in AV. I can't imagine them being happy about that. The bridge is a bullshit design though, even as Alliance I think it's stupid.
---
Nice pun bro!
---
Yep it's not such a big deal really to switch between them. I have used that first macro as well on a character I had. You get used to pressing it every now and then. 
---
 I don't think it's worth it for a fresh launch though. Even if layering helps it will probably be a bit of a hassle to keep the skill level on your gathering profession up to par. Having two of them might prove to much work. Also you lose a lot of bag space. On a fresh server with only small bags available you will run out of room fast.
---
Like others have said, it’s 50. 
---
Keep in mind, if you’re going to be respecing a lot, that’s going to take a huge chunk out of your gold income. And if you respec with any consistency, it’s going to pretty much stay 50. 
---
I was always broke in vanilla because I would constantly play different specs on my druid. Fun, but I was always poor lol.
---
You are confusing good with popular, they can be mutually exclusive
---
Why are they shown as skulls if they're 63? That's fucky
---
Yea that's a dick move. You want the perks of tanking and getting fast groups, then you get second pickings on the DPS gear and you get tank gear. I wouldn't join your group with those loot rules, and I'm sure many others wouldn't either.
---
Stoneform is really good against rogues, who if they are smart will go wound+mind numbing aginst you.  That is 6 poisons to dispel through without crippling.  Also hunter that are smart will get a scorpion pet that will apply a poison sting debuff to you when they viper spam you.  Not to mention situations where you are getting focused by more then one rogue or more then one hunter at once.  
---
Mosty obvious use it for breaking blind, especially if you are saving bubble or it is down, and you bop against a rogue they will near 100% of the time blind your bop, restealth and reopen without you ever healing.  Breaking that blind with a stoneform, completely changes that matchup.
---
They have already implemented fixes for layering. Gathering Herbs/Ore, opening Chests, getting into combat now triggers an ICD of layer hopping on the beta servers. You can only change layers after a certain amount of time has passed since last action that you did(I guess a few minutes).
---
It's the best they can do without making layering feel stupid for the people who just want to play normal without abusing the layers(eg. grouping up for an elite quest).
---
Layering will only be around for 4-6 months, just deal with it.
---
From what I've read from other posts pservers had the rep values wrong. It is very unlikely you'll have enough rep to get a tiger mount by 40 let alone 60. The quests will not give enough xp and then you need to runecloth submissions
---
BOTTOM TEXT
---
It doesn't matter how many times you explain it. The problem isn't that people are farming gold, the problem is that there isn't anything preventing inflation in the long run. Even if players weren't farming gold, there would still be inflation because there aren't adequate gold sinks. It is a systemic failure by the designers of retail's economy, not the fault that people farm gold.
---
You wont even be ganked that much anyway. I think you are overreacting a lot. I think not playing with friends because getting killed a few times while leveling is really weird decision. Maybe try and not get so triggered by gankers, idk how though
---
It could be a paint-over tho.
---
Yeah I’ve seen it! Looks like it’ll work nicely And there’s a cool UI set up too that looks more fitting I’m gonna just make a new post if it’s offending people but thank you for being kind.
---
Saying a lot worse makes it sound like it’s going to cause the raid to wipe. Wearing all plate is fine if you at least pay attention. Vanilla raids are so easy it’s ridiculous.
---
It seems like the tank sets are 100% optimized for survivability. That won't do you much good when you can't hold any aggro at all.
---
Prot warriors will want stuff like Band of Accuria in phase 2 for example.
---
@campodim, you should make a "dwarf/human ret pala" at some point, the bis is way different on those two classes :)
---
I've only ever done it on private, but the plant packs in DM east are easily soloable with consecration and early epic gear.  They drop living essence, all sorts of random grays, and random herbs.  Late in the expo they also drop savage fronds which is quite good.
---
I want a RP-PvP server as well, but if it doesn't happen I'm going PvP. Vanilla WoW for me was all about World PvP so that's the number one thing I want to engage in. When it comes down to picking between RP or PVP, I'll pick PvP as I need the ruleset that automatically makes people flagged in contested zones. People simply won't be arsed to flag for PvP on RP servers even if they say they want an 'authentic' experience. People would rather level in peace and I'm not here for that. I like that extra risk that comes with leveling in a contested zone and you can bet your sweet ass my Hunter will track down any Hode she spots and put them down for daring to desecrate her forest. 
---
Besides, I can RP with friends on any server and if the community picks a PvP server as the unofficial one? We should be good. When Wildstar rolled all the servers into one mega server, RP didn't die. My group of friends still RPed publicly and I still ran open RP events weekly. All you need for RP is people who will engage with you for RP, no server flag needed. While a PvP server has to have those contested zones and auto-flagging else people will always play it safe.  
---
I also honestly don't expect the pve RP community to be huge in Classic WoW as Retail has all of the QoL changes and flashy new models the majority of RPers would prefer.
---
Except you didnt. Not even close. Bad troll. Just so incredibly cringe
---
Francis was hilarious. He’s actually really gotten his act together. He lost a ton of weight and turned his memery into an online business. He has some vids about why he isn’t coming back (WoW was his heroin) but also understand why people are excited.
---
Warrior has good dps while levelling. Their problem is downtime, similar to mage. Druid/priest have lower dps but no downtime.
---
Not so simple really.
---
Being Horde or Alliance is a big factor.
---
But honestly lack of knowledge is a big part of it. My guild didn't even realize fury was any good until AQ40 and still I was the only warr who vouched to go DW fury and suddenly I was top 5-6 in damage on some fights instead of tailing at the bottom. Imagine if I knew how to gear properly like I do now or played a Human.
---
Also the threat boost to shield slam also helped Prot Warriors (1.10 or 1.11) so Furys didn't have to hold back as much and alliance warriors could often go all out. The problem is this wasn't really discovered and tested thoroughly back then and with TBC around the corner there wasn't enough time for the spec to catch on.
---
Pally aoe tanking is actually really great for dungeons. It just requires the group to actually cooperate, which isn't the best for pugs. You may regret leveling as protection though because consecration is very helpful (but not necessary) for tanking. You most likely wont end up tanking in raids except for aoe trash unless your friend group is the core officers of the guild and they want to carry you hard. 
---
Additionally making a damage on being struck/ on block set, you can farm lots of gold by farming SM cath or the stockades, so it's pretty great to be a prot pally.
---
I don't know when Pally's are able to bubble hearth, but that's also a great option to do and just hop zones if you're getting ganked. 
---
I'd say give it a go. You'll regret not playing with your friends if you play elsewhere, and worst case you can always switch to pve. You'll probably realize by 30 or 40 if you can't do pvp servers, and it won't be too painful to get rid of your progress and start over then (but only because classic isn't going anywhere so you being late on that pve server wont make much of a difference)
---
No, but what you can do is use an addon that will show you all the spawn locations for nodes. It won't show whats up, just where it could potentially be.
---
Eventually you memorize a decent route for a zone and its ezpz
---
I think the only monetization I would tolerate would be a limited rerelease of the TCG loot cards e.g. spectral tiger. O want them to be rare, but they should also be possible to obtain without forking over $800 on ebay.
---
I used to post a couple of stacks of rugged leather that normally sold for 90 silver as 1s bid and 90g buyout, when people sorted they sorted by lowest price so people would buyout my stacks when they wherent paying attention. Made like 400g when I just turned 60 that way.
---
Lol really who gives a shit. You guys are pedantic as fuuuck.
---
Ah yes. You're a troll. Cringe. Let's not say anything concrete that can be answered.
---
Do you think they will increase beta level cap and we can find out for sure?
---
It would have been hilarious if they made classic part of the lore like this. Retail is one timeline vanilla is another
---
Try and recruit officers per role first. Your main tank is one, then you want one for melee, ranged, and healers, and one of those should be your raid leader. You can spread out to class leaders but that's overkill in my opinion, and leads to resentment within classes. Instead 2-3 community reps might be a good idea, a step below your officers and with no input on raids, but with visibility of officer chat and tasked with recruitment/retention.
---
For one person to set this up is pretty difficult. You can try and grab people as you level, finding a decent supply of tanks and healers from dungeon groups. Be helpful to everybody you can find. Run elite quests multiple times if you need to. Save people from ganks. Talk in general. Run quest groups. Your rep will be massively important.
---
The transition into raiding is going to hopefully be something that comes naturally. Ideally you'll have enough people in your guild by 50+ that you'll regularly be running Strat/Scholo/BRD/ST etc as guild runs. Get your tanks and healers geared, sign up any pugs that you take along who look half decent. When you're able to provide these runs consistently people will be looking to join your guild because they know it will work out for them in the long run, they'll get groups and get gear.
---
Set up a discord, get a twitter handle, recruit on forums. Good luck if you decide to go ahead.
---
to be equally cynical blizzard is pretty much just setting up WoW classic and then letting it run for 2 years the need for additional devlopment is minimal so they just need to keep people subed for those 2 years to rake in the money they are due on the project adding other means of generating money cuts that short.
---
due to the low revnue assumed on the project and the now likly high return they will let the current plan run its corse then we can see how they mess with it for more money.
---
Don't worry about a new post. You did exactly right. It breaks none of the sub's rules and cross-posting is exactly how Reddit wants things to operate.
---
Roguecraft was before diminishing returns. Any paladin losing to a rogue is insanely bad.
---
Sure, it's cool... If you like mudhuts.
---
Cool artwork though.
---
So I almost come to terms with not being able to play the game I fell in love with due to a lot of responsibilities including becoming a first time Dad to my amazing son Eli and also a 50+ hour full time job but then I seen it... some guy playing a recent version of WoW on a handheld device!!
---
Here’s the link: https://youtu.be/9HDUfvv-84A
---
And another:https://youtu.be/QkO1u-UjZKw
---
At first I thought *yeah right* but after a little digging I found it to be completely possible to play classic on it! and it is the perfect way to level up in my limited spare time.
---
This beautiful little creation is called the GPD Win 2 and here are the specs:
---
CPU	64-bit x86 Intel Core M3-7Y30 (1.00 GHz/2.60 GHz max) TDP 15W
---
Graphics	Intel HD 615 Graphics (300 MHz/900 MHz max)
---
Memory	8GB LPDDR3 1866 RAM
---
Storage	128GB M.2 2242 solid-state drive MicroSD removable storage No capacity ceiling
---
This is genuinely ideal for me I won’t be raiding on this or anything drastic just simply levelling up and some farming. When I do get a nice few hours to myself at home alone (happens like twice a week) I’ll be doing all my other stuff on my computer.
---
I found a post by a guy named u/Carpaintergeril that I shared here but it got some hate calling me a lazy poster so I’ve quickly put this together on my phone here’s the link to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/73metd/world_of_warcraft_on_the_gpd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2 goes in to depth about button macros and also UI settings.
---
Just thought I would share it with you guys maybe it will give hope to others wanting to go back to the place we all fell in love with  again but simply can’t due to lack of time to sit on a computer.
---
I do love this game and I wish I could no life like I did back in the day but it’s literally not an option if you want to hate on this post go ahead but if it helps even just one guy out then it’s worth it :)
---
Was gonna say this 100% looked like a massively popular image from long ago with some shit filter on top and low and behold I'm not the only one to notice it.
---
Well I would certainly take that :D
---
I've seen some people say this but that just seems like an insane approach to me. Why all roll need on some green that might be a decent upgrade for someone which you are just going to vendor for less than 1 gold anyway.
---
For stuff like bis twink items such as Sentry Cloak I can understand since the gold value on the AH will be much more than the stat improvement for any party member, but that is one of a few exceptions.
---
Rule #7: No low effort memes
---
You seem to be going out of your way to confuse yourself.
---
&gt; The part where it is acceptable to need something that gives +1 stat upgrade, but could be vendored for 10g or sharded.
---
This will very rarely come up, and if it does the vendor price is the same for the person who gets and upgrade and the person who does not.
---
&gt; What if it is a sidegrade or for offspec, and wouldn't even help their dps/main role?
---
Are you asking because you are genuinely confused? For BoPs, mainspec and upgrades take precedence. For BoEs it does not matter, everyone rolls Need anyway.
---
&gt; Why is it alright to say that 1 stat per 10g is more valuable for you than the 21 frost spell power for 500g of a Freezing band to the mage of the party?
---
I have no idea what you are trying to ask.
---
&gt; You could also argue that while you're doing the dungeon and while it is sitting in the AH, that freezing ring is similarly going to waste in the same way that gear that isn't getting worn and is just getting vendored is going to waste.
---
If you were stupid I guess you could argue that. But why would you?
---
&gt; What about if a boe green that doesn't vendor for much drops, but could replace an under leveled piece of equipment for someone in the group and be a huge upgrade. Does everyone roll on it because its a boe?
---
Unless I missed it, nobody said that everyone should roll need on greens. Can you point to where anyone said that? Because otherwise you are arguing with an imaginary person.
---
&gt; Is it boe blues? Is it boe epics? Is it twink items of high value?
---
That is what it seems to be. What about this confused you?
---
I've been there before, but I think there is a ceiling so I just... drowned.
---
Being proud of something so little is on you. Not blizzard.
---
&gt;"Need" is when you actually need something
---
I *need* the gold, friend.
---
Anyone willing to tank/heal. I started healing Stratholme on my priest at level 49, and on my paladin, tanked it in quest greens and BRD blues the moment I hit 60. What you'll want to do is gather a few good friends as you level to fill in the gaps in your group. Finding good DPS is often more important than finding a good tank/healer because the vast majority of wipes are due to people being stupid. Any group can handle these instances if they're smart.
---
Plus, the faster your DPS kills, the more money you make. Getting good connections as you level is the greatest thing you can do for both gold and gearing. Find out peoples' professions and ambitions as well; if they seem competent and desire to raid or gear up later on, befriend them for the profession benefits and a potential invite into a raid as a guest.
---
Treat your gold farming like an actual business/job, with all the intricacies like making connections and good customer service, and it'll go much smoother.
---
9gag? Dude, come on. Have some self-respect.
---
Vanilla itemization for hybrids had spread out stats and no focus so was generally terrible. T3 finally specialized and it was obviously night and day.
---
Bringing Freedom to the Eastern Kingdoms one gank at a time.
---
i saw that too. made me mad.
---
Seeing as beta doesn’t have any of those game breaking problem I doubt classic will have it.
---
You won't face Paladins in PvP. They take an obnoxiously long time to kill.
---
But i see no Ironforge here...
---
Didn't you just post this....
---
Wow...not a bad idea
---
This isn’t the Undercity.
---
Did you not read what I put....
---
Dude. Be reasonable. Nobody cares about little scrub greens. This is talking about anything with importance. Blues, Epics, Patterns, Recipes, and resources, stuff like that.
---
i sign
---
Forever because thats the point.
---
It finds success because of what it doesnt have, trying to shoehorn things in to make that extra dollar is where they end up back at retail and back in the situation they are in now.
---
And have you accounted for how to get past the suspicious activity monitoring / alert tools in place?
---
 You're still account sharing.
---
Yeah it's the same as before.. lol
---
Filthy Alliance spy, the Horde has always been great.
---
Oh for sure. I wasn't trying to defend farming for gold every week to sustain raid prep. I just always had a lot of gold for whatever reason, and in BC (the only xpac I seriously pushed hard for progression) I don't remember it being prohibitively expense to be ready every week, and I was utilizing 100% of possible consumables. From what I remember it was Potions (mana and spellpower), Flask, oil, food. Flasks were really the only sink. I was also an alchemist so that helped.
---
ah yes, the difference between useful dps and number padding
---
reminds me of a paladin we had in wrath would during uldur would overheal the shit out of the machines we had to jump in to boost his numbers. he was booted not long after that was discovered in world of logcraft
---
Cast for minute go OOM
---
There you have it
---
Same here. I'm a relaxed leveler that enjoys crafting and to be honest, I'm really bad at PVP.  It dawned on me this time around that I don't have to "get gud". I can avoid 99% of that grief just by rolling on a PVE server. I can't wait.
---
The photobucket link you posted is of the TBC art which presumably was introduced with patch 2.0.
---
The art definitely did not change with 1.9 and I highly doubt it changed anytime during vanilla.
---
Oof
---
I played a lot of resto in vanilla. Honestly, it was pretty good as is. I guess if I could have my dream changes i would add a talent in there that could give you resist to dispels for PvP healing. Being heavily reliant on HoTs could make you fodder a lot of the times if you were getting spam purged. 
---
For PvE, maybe some better MP5 talents or mana reduction. They could go OOM pretty quick if you weren’t careful. 
---
But overall resto was the best spec of the three. It wasn’t the best healer, but that was kind of the point. You were a hybrid.
---
False. Stormwind is best
---
I'm not sure if you're trolling or what but to my knowledge there is no such thing as a private server that allows you to play alliance and horde together. Look at the buffs they have, the mask icon is a buff that change the appearance of your character.
---
you just need to buy a sub and BfA (a total of 45 bucks when blizzard put it on sale)
---
however blizzard is trying to deflate the market in BfA ( a big reason people aren't playing it isn't profitbal to play the game so letting the money sit gives it more value than letting it go threw the market) so saying just farm retail for WoW tokens is a bad idea as it simply takes to much work. i will much rather give WoW that 1 hour of work inorder to play the game than the 20 to play for "free".
---
&gt; How do you know how many hours I'll use it for? Or how big an upgrade it is?
---
I am assuming that the people involved have brains and can do very simple arithmetic. If this is hard for you then you have my sympathies. Ask someone in your group with a brain who can do very simple arithmetic to help you out.
---
&gt; Let's assume however it is big, and it is many hours. This applies to both BoE and BoP. 
---
No. Let me explain this to you. With BoE there is a difference which is that you can sell it to someone else, or buy it from someone else, and the amount you can sell it for or buy it for is unaffected by how much you can use it personally. A 400g BoE is a 400g BoE for everyone in the party.
---
&gt; Money is also relative, so if you have 6000g in the bank, an extra 3g is worth less than someon who has 1g in the bank.
---
If you really believe this, then you should give away all your money to people with less money than you. After all if you have 6000g and I have 1g, then 1g is worth more to me than you, so you should trade me 3000g for my 1g. So I think that you do not really believe this.
---
&gt; I understand it all, the point is there's so many variables, beyond what I even mentioned. To the point where its completely subjective
---
Maybe to you it is so confusing that you have to retreat into radical subjectivism. The rest of us are capable of understanding it. BoEs are equally valuable to everyone, BoPs are more valuable to people who can use them before they vendor/shard them.
---
&gt; That's why need/greed was even a thing.
---
Again you are trying to interpret game mechanics as if they were a holy text, instead of treating them as tools to use to get good outcomes.
---
Yes, the accounts will never login to anything but one machine that they've been logged into for months now playing the Beta. We're connecting remotely, which is how all of our members have been able to test their routes and such on the Beta, since not all have an invite.
---
&gt;the people who actually get to make decisions dont know shit about gaming
---
President of Blizzard isn't some random exec he is a literal former developer, kinda silly to suggest he doesnt know shit about gaming.
---
Oh I agree with you on the pvp side, mages are fun as fuck. But people who are going to focus on raiding and believe that where the class fall on the dps meter matters, really should think twice before deciding on a class. 
---
I'd rather have a a good player on a non top 3 dps spec and doing his job. Than an idiot pressing one button and topping the charts.
---
I never said how long should they stay out, I said how long can we expect, never underestimate how multi billion dollar companies will screw you over
---
In a nutshell - vanilla by design encourages player autonomy. Retail is designed in such a way that disallows that
---
FUCKING BLIZZUUUURD.
---
Also the guy who said people don't actually want classic
---
your closing quotation mark is in the wrong spot. should be after "fortnite"
---
That is true
---
thank you kindly
