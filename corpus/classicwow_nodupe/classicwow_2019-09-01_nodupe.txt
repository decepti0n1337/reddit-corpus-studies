I need to dig a bit.. I saw a guy comment that he would eat his hat if MC was cleared first week yesterday or 2 days ago.
---

---
Edit: ["People was so sure for first week ragna yet nobody is even 60 yet. I will eat my hat if ragna is down before reset."](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxelrc/ragna_first_week_i_dont_think_so/)

Well known and established private server guild. All members commit a ton of time to the guild, their focus is actually PVP but they are just so good they decided to get PVE world first too. They have years of practice and hardcore experience before this moment so when classic came out they had perfect routes to level and all the skill to PVP/raid when maxed.
---
Running/chasing mobs are definitely peeling off onto bystanders in a way I remember very clearly from EverQuest, but *not* from WoW. My memory isn’t the greatest, though, and in original I was always with a group and not having to run for my life so much. 
---
I’ve apologized to a lot of people today for accidentally training mobs onto them.
---
What do u mean by slow? Like no one does anything? Or do u mean levelling wise?
---
Remember when this subreddit was saying it was impossible to even have a full guild raid enter before week 1?
---
Lol, Rag dead within 5 days
---
There is no honor system yet.
---
Fukkin undertuned content smh ON TO THE NEXT SERVER BOYS
---
Are we sure that was Classic and not a private server because I can't fathom how 40 people hit 60 and a day later they've not only farmed the requirements to summon Rag, but also downed him. 
---
Its not a question of skill, its a question of time
---
Now wait a week and do it again.
---
Video On Demand
---
~~Since when?~~  (forgot you could just walk in from BRD).  And what happened to the quest to get some water that'll put out the runes in front of the bosses letting you fight them?
---
Basically different group of people playing classic and retail now. Calm.
---
How many retail guilds are actually playing classic though? Only like 5-10 people from actual Method guild are playing classic and rest are just random streamers.
---
Also Retail raids are harder, end bosses take 300+ pulls, some 600+. This race was just who can get 20-30 people to 60 first and a private server guild that has done it before and practiced and prepped for it was always going to win. Method people had done almost no prep to level quickly.
---
Watching that Rag kill there were less mechanics than in LFR.
---
Lol good for you I guess.
---
Well well well.. looks like someone has a hat to eat.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/ascalontv
---
Of course. I don't think any reasonable person will say that Naxx won't be cleared Day1. It's a given.
---
blizzard warned everyone days before the game even launched to move to a low pop server or there will be massive queues.
---
nice
---
[deleted]
---
I like to think they're more along the lines of "cool guys don't look at explosions". "Yeah, we killed Rag in a week, so? Whatever, we'd kill Kel tomorrow but blizz hasn't released him yet so no big deal."
---
Play a druid. You'll blend in as her pet half the time and you can both shadowmeld
---
Imagine being convinced by Method they were actually going to claim world first. But hey.... here you are promoting their name again, so I guess they did a job well done.
---
So what? It's been 15 years, of course people are gonna find other ways to play to game. It's not 2005 anymore, and it's not the same game an it never will be.
---
No way those are getting pugged. Don't you remember 10 year anniversary? And this is harder, requires raid leader and 39 people who can follow instructions.
---
Actually hilarious that they see this as a joke compared to pservers
---
I thought it was MC mobs only ._.
---
people claim its fake but that seems so unlikey
---
You need to buy the actual retail game and not just game time.
---
Lol, thinking rag would last beyond one week is retarded. 
---
And it's most of the classic audience coming up with the assertion that it's impossible because LoOk At ThE KiLl DaTeS, cLaSsIc Is HaRdEr ThAn ReTaIl
---
That's a false equivalent if I've ever seen one 
---
Layering isn't against the rules. Speeding is.
---
this was always going to be the way, everyone is going to classic with a modern wow mindset, the original experience can't be replicated 100%
---
Average Joe specifically refers to an average American male.
---
The sad part is, everyone on here swore a 2005 game is so difficult and downvoted me for saying they're deluded by nostalgia, and these people are clearing raids on day 4 with no wipes. lmfao hard btw it'll take months btw
---
If you had a decade and still not getting it perhaps it’s time to move on to retail
---
I expended my luck at lvl 12. I got all four Zhevra Hooves in my first four kills.
---
People actually thought a retail guild would get world first rag lol
---
Paladin is super wrong lol. There’s a whole rotation and it makes the mob die really fast.
---
WF on a long retail dungeon, gz.
---
Yet method can't even tie their own shoes
---
hes played every hour of every day since 2 hours after release, never logging off never stopping, his /played after rag kill was 4 days 1 hour, so he had been playing since release day to today without stopping at all, and then isnt tired whatsoever on stream afterwards. hm not account sharing here. also when i asked how he stayed up for 4 days straight in his chat he perma banned me from his channel within seconds. huh
---
also they killed rag first pull with 0 deaths, so none of these 40 people who have been up for 4 days straight made no mistakes at all. hm alright
---
How about the itemization? Would it still be this timing with 1.1 items?
---
How was layering the reason for a fast rag kill? They more or less just farmed dungeons from 20-60 ish.
---
Vanilla raiding is for 40 people, the margin for error is absolutely massive. All 40 of these players have cleared MC hundreds of times and are playing perfectly. Not even considering that MC is an entry level raid and pretty braindead.
---
never underestimate neets
---
Method aren't struggling? And there's no gear checks in vanilla, you can do naxx with your pre-raid bis. It's a joke.
---
I don't think it's even a contest, retail is easily the harder game mechanically.  Retail raids/dungeons require a lot more movement, and rotations are lot less repetitive with less down time.
---
Doesn't really matter even. If we picked games solely on difficulty, we'd be doing competitive abstract algebra 'n whatnot.
---
We were doing 40-45k/h in SM Cath as 4 Warriors 1 Shaman, so I'd say it is quite plausible.
---
[removed]
---
except for goblin glider kits, the only "good" that came out of WoD. The only item in WoW history that wasn't scrapped or unusable in the following expansions.
---
Well well well..
---
You should re-read the quote.
---
&gt;**While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further**, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, **with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2** of our content unlock plan.
---
The player cap is going down once they remove layering. 
---
&gt;30k+ trying to get on each server, and they cap it so only 10% of the population can play. Yea no, never gonna happen and people will quit because dead server.
---
They've literally been telling people repeatedly that these realms are too overcrowded and to leave. They've been telling people that the queues will possibly get so bad they you won't even be able to enter the queue.
---
&gt;The pop limit will NEVER be around 3,500
---
Pretty sure they've confirmed this.
---
Awesome! Thank you, it was really annoying me. One more question. Is there a way in game or with an addon to move the tooltip box? I can't seem to find anything.
---
So it's a problem that's not fixed yet, so it's a fact that I can't tell what gear your wearing when your mogged. What's your argument here once again.
---
Very curious about their gear. It can’t be great
---
What are you on about? People always used trade for groups did they not? Add-ons ALWAYS existed even back in Classic. Ofc people are going to be more efficient and try to do things quicker these days, were older and have less time. Dungeons aren't easier, they have less mechanics than retail wow does, things just hit harder and take longer to kill than retail does.
---
What’s their secret to leveling?
---
People knowing they had baron geddon debuf and hope they run  away was hard too :D
---
Moo when asked about how they did it replied "it's only molten core..." ,and that they've been grinding MC about 200 times on vanilla private servers !
---
Im a bit impressed. I honestly was doubting a week 1 rag kill.
---
Lolololol, fuck Method
---

For most attacks I use something like this to turn on auto attack:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast Heroic Strike
---
    /startattack
---
Its half the joke. The other half is the guild name
---
She's beautiful! And I'm so happy. Can't believe someone wanted to help me, even when I died like 5 times taming her due to red gear and other factors..
---
Boy, that escalated quickly
---
Definitely your call and depends how you're levelling. I'm doing duo so I went 5 wand then 5 ST, but you could consider alternating as well. Kargoz has a priest levelling guide where he goes into better detail than I could.
---
Also, MC was cleared multiple times in vanilla with sub 20 players. Even before Naxx/AQ came out.
---
Yes. In a raid you got nothing but loot and pvp exp, and it couldn't be quest related.
---
Yup unless you plan to spam dungeon, not much point putting all talents into resto tree. Most should go into feral, you can switch at 60 or a few levels before.
---
Well the hard part are the insane dps checks in retail, yes anyone can do mechanics if they got nothing else to do. DPS checks are tight on hard bosses so the skill comes in when you gotta maximize your dps while dealing with all the mechanics. There is a huge gap between amazing player and average when it comes to that. 
---
Also insane dps checks means heavily underhealing, some fights are 2 healed to make dps checks.
---
not being able to play would ruin classic, layering is the lesser evil and also temporary
---
That's the portal trainers level not the required level.. the required level is 24.
---
1) kill lots of things.
---
2) do 1 fast
---
This was possible in vanilla, why would it be patched out? Just because people didn't do it than?
---
wat
---
I would love an option to toggle updated graphics personally.
---
&gt;This medium/high pop server I'm on that launched a few hours after Classic went live doesn't even have 100 people above level 30
---
Your server is gona be dead in a month.
---
Agreed. What changes
---
Imagine being this much of a bitch lol
---
No sleep + best classic wow nerds in the world
---
dude he litterly stood there spamming frostbolts. doesn't matter how many they killed rag on private servers lol. they had level 44's+ in there raid.
---
That or orc for stun resist. Good choice ;)
---
Yeah people talk to animals all the time! Its BS
---
Yeah the content that takes 700+ attempts for the first guilds would be a perfect fit for someone who can't kill ragnaros
---
you can clear MC with a bunch of 58 meme specs, it's really not that big of a gear check.
---
Very informative. Thanks

Wait what???

Unfortunately, vanilla WoW raids are insultingly easy by today's standards (and to be fair, WoW raids in general even mythic+ are very easy compared to some other MMOs out there). Designers didn't quite know what they could or could not get away with and gear was far more difficult to acquire so bosses had to be designed to account for a huge multitude of setups. Add to the fact that all these are all old bosses untouched, which means they've been studied and tested to hell and back and perfect strats for getting them down are very easy to find.
---
It's about that time when people slowly start to realize that Classic WoW raiding was never difficult. It was just very time and patience consuming. The only two reasons people died back then was because they either just had no gear or they weren't used to mechanics that by today are very common -- for example, standing in front of a boss is going to get you cleaved or standing behind a dragon is going to get you tail-swiped. Nobody knew that back then until they were told or took it to the face.
---
Rule of thumb was 2 stacks of sunder back in Vanilla. Then you start, preferably not nuking your ass of instantly. But if the tank got two stacks of sunder it should be no issue to start DPS:ing.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cx7c2g/is_there_anyone_that_has_a_legit_shot_at_week_1/ not hundreds but here's a few people saying it wouldn't happen just a couple days ago
---
Stream wasn't up until after the OP posted, idiot.
---
I’m a hunter. I’ve been hoarding scrolls of intellect, doesn’t matter which. Whenever someone fucks up I cast it on them and say “get smart.” I almost exclusively use it on warriors “tanking” dungeons.
---
Yeah, ditto.
---
I don't get it. Like people wanted Classic for so long...what's the point of rushing to 60. /shrug
---
asmon hosted
---
so why did method not get it first? if vanilla is such a joke and retail wow is strictly more difficult, then method should defacto be the 1 horse race like they are there.
---
isn't there gear requirements to kill shit fast enough that it doesn't enrage? how is this possible :P
---
Ouch...
---
Lots of gullible people, apparently. xD
---
Carefully now. He’s a hero.
---
Got downvoted into hell and called a retard because I said that there was no way in hell Rag would survive first reset.
---
WoW Classic is a complete game; BfA is just an expansion. It isn't even close.
---
they literally chose not to go for the world first rag. they said as much before release, saying they were going to stream their journeys but that they weren't going for world firsts as method.
---
This is true, it is pretty much the same for Skyrim as well. Dark colours, not much colour blended into the world. Even the forest areas felt dark as the volcano areas.
---
I don't know whats this and can't even imagine how it plays.
---
I call bullshit.
---
The funny thing is, most popular private servers made raids harder for basically this very reason, shit was way too easy, and with 1.12 talents and abilities, it's even easier than it normally should be.  They were basically on the extra easy version of content they've done probably hundreds of times.
---
I'll be honest, I thought it wouldn't be killed until next reset, but only because of level, not gear or consumables.  I wasn't sure any one guild could get enough level 55+ characters to take it down in the first week (also this launch has been MUCH MUCH MUCH more stable than I thought it would be, kudo's to blizz for that.)
---
We pug'd them in vanilla. On off nights I'd load up my tank alt and lead groups through MC in 2-3 hours, anyone that wanted to come off trade channel. Raids aren't exactly 40 man in vanilla, think more like 20 decent players with 20 warm bodies. It's not hard to spam frostbolt my man. In 1.12 we were pug'ing bwl/aq40 as well. I would have started grabbing people for naxx 40 if we didn't use my warrior for.. that fucking fight. :-/ 
---
If you don't think they can' be pug'd, you're in for a shock.
---
seems to have fixed it for the most part... now if im not in a party i cant cast it lol, it just says not in party
---
MC gets pugged on the regular on any vanilla server
---
“Unlimited” means as much as you can talk your boss into without HR noticing. Month-long paid vacations are much less common at places with unlimited PTO than those with explicit days.
---
Gotta love how theres a bunch of people here saying "Wheres the ppl that said Ragnaros wouldnt be cleared in a week?"  This is a group of people that are tired of killing Ragnaros on private servers, completely expected event and should be separated from the rest of the community that plays retail and hasnt played vanilla in ages.
---
I literally pug raids in retail with mechanics 50x harder than vanilla what are you talking about?
---
Too relatable
---
He just said on stream that they had a whole team dedicated to farming that rep, and just summoned them in.
---
👍🏻
---
They're pserver players who have been doing this exact thing for like 5 years now
---
weird energy investment
---
Benediction will do that for ya. Best east coast pvp server around. Not a single queue. Plenty of people, community already forming. Good times.
---
I made a YouTube video like over a year ago saying how easy classic raiding would be that it would be the easiest iteration of raiding ever due to things like 1.12 talents in early raids and I got downvoted to oblivion told to go back to retail told that I couldn't use private servers as a source that Classic would be way more difficult etc lol

---
ouch
---
Oof.
---
Right here,  i'm not suprised they killed rag within hours of them all getting 60,   My shock is that they got to 60 that fast,  it used to take a few weeks.   Though i probably didn't take into account 14 years of potential practice/optimisation that could go into prepping for it.
---
It's especially fun because he doesn't realize the 150 days is because the game was new and no1 knew how to level. 
---
15 chars below 60 in the raid and 0 consumables farmed or used.
---
The amount of consumables matches the wipes as well.
---
It's fucking 0.
---
My mind is so tuned for classic that I read “3s” as 3 silver and it too me a second
---
You don't need much practice for simple mechanics.
---
This has nothing to do with raids being easy or not. It is known content that players have already completed. You put out any raid from BfA or Legion and it would be done the same day. That it might be harder would only matter to mid or low level guilds.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What I did not think was possible was to get through the leveling and other grinds to even try to do MC in the first place. When that gnome hit 60 with nearly 2 days played less than the old worlds best time from back in the day, that might have been a clue this was going to happen.
---
ya good luck with patchwerk in pre-raid bis
---
No this is a completely new game
---
Not raiding in particular, but everything else prior to max in retail is easier than Haris Pilton.
---
Unlike in Classic where pulling more than one mob is a death sentence unless you have some of the maddest kiting skills ever, Hunters can literally fucking solo dungeons in BFA while levelling. That’s due to Revive Pet having a 3 second cast time and costing jack shit, oh and pets generally having good stats.
---
And let’s not forget how good Hunter self sustain is in BFA. If you use a Ferocity pet, you literally get 10% Leech.
---
Trainers are just paid a few coppers for every skill. The rest are taxes to fuel the socialist state economy.
---
Classic is not Vanilla. Better to view classic as the patch before BC. Classic has better class balancing then Vanilla for one thing. Druids as an example do not have to go all the way into resto to get innervate anymore. As a Druid main who raided in Vanilla as feral for as long as I could before guild needs forced me resto, I can not undersell the importance of that change. Many classes had similar balance adjustments.
---
While that is not the only reason classic raids will fall faster then in Vanilla, it is one thing people are not factoring into the discussion enough imo.
---
Interesting. As someone on what seems to be a low queue server (Myrzael), is it fair to assume the majority of queue complaint threads are coming from mostly these servers?
---
How bad were your retail pugs?
---
This legit makes me think Classic is far undertuned (at least MC) compared to 2004 WoW
---
So being faster than anyone else? Isn't that the point of a world first?
---
Locks are the kings of 1v1 but they come with a lot of downsides too. They’re the slowest class in the game so anyone who doesn’t want to die to you, doesn’t have to. They also have no options for escaping no-win situations. That’s the trade-off with locks. In ideal circumstances they’re unstoppable but can be quite frustrating at times too.
---
Yeah I know, just saying that people who hadn't done the content will probably still find enjoyment in it.
---
Outside you may be a simple geologist, but in here you are Anustart, Defender of the Alliance.
---
Then I guess you didn't play much vanilla.
---
What's greedy?
---
Or shaman.
---
We used to make groups with a tank, a healer and one of the dos was the support was someone else who could resurrect or had a wipe prevention (warlock). Offheals usually came in handy too in the very early days
---
There's 1 professional retail guild, Method, and they're not competing in classic.
---
You can say it's simple, but you can't use this as an example in your argument, because again, they have years of practice on the exact same mechanics, anything would be "simple".
---
&gt;Not really no, just some guys who play on private servers that got trashed by retail arena players in the tournament.... and trashed by asmongold's group of randoms 0/3 in a bg lmao.
---
they've already played this content hundreds of times for the past decade. They just did it this fast for the challenge.
---
Fake news.
---
Yeah, for every random person who buffs you in classic WoW there's a person who shows up and just stands there as you die so they can get that mining node. Those people are also on this sub.
---
You gotta make sure you're on an RP server
---
Are you trying to brag about the fact 15 year old content that's been farmed for just as long, nonstop on p-servers didn't last as long as never seen before raid content? Seems like an odd argument
---
40 people who have been practicing MC speedruns for 3+ years do NOT represent the actual stance of the game's raiding. 
---
Calm your tits.
---
The animation of ESO is so bad. I looked at gameplay for like 30 seconds and almost puked
---
lol
---
Cleared everything but Naxx, did BC, WoTLK and Pandaria and then quit, but sure.
---
Exactly my point. My guild was progressing through naxx with 6 Australians who all had 400ms ping, half the raid was keyboard turning, we had holy paladins who thought stacking int was the most important thing, or that wearing all judgement was clearly the best thing to do. The servers crashed constantly, nobody farmed consumables.
---
All this stuff and we still got through most of naxx. Anybody claiming that vanilla's content is 'hard' in the execution sense is out of their mind. It's hard to get 40 people into the same raid, it isn't hard to play around a boss' one mechanic.
---
With macros u can use multiple spells or abilities @ once, combined with certain commands like trinket use or weapon equiping.
---
It basicaly makes your life easier.
---
Wish everyone was like you sir - I have received no less that 20 PMs so far saying I should go kill myself - wtf is wrong with people? 
---
I stated an opinion that I thought it couldn’t be done this quickly without them being geared up which I honestly as without malice believed to be true - I’m quite happy to be proved wrong.
---
The level of shear hate I have gotten from stating said opinion is just ludicrous. 
---
Seriously thinking about stopping playing classic now as up until this happened I was enjoying the lack of toxicity and that players where being decent to each other again
---
Well for one, the guy streaming said on average they only slept about 10 hours since launch, so about 2 hours of sleep each day.
---
Method isn't even raiding in classic lmao use google.
---
Probably. Faerlina alone has almost a five hour queue wait time.

Sad how many people would downvote you for trying to explain that, but what's even more sad is the people still downvoting over it and raging on this thread about how this was a private server, they used exploits, "well they're just pro players so", etc  lol
---
Yeah I saw was really surprised, but hey grats to them!
---
It's part of wanting to maintain the "I'm hardcore" identity. Even implying that retail is harder than classic is downvote central.
---
OSRS players do this too even though OSRS combat is braindead easy.
---

False. My blueberry boi has tagged quest mobs on multiple occasions

---
These are reconstructed bugs.
---
haha I mean Ragnaros was always notorious for being basically a giant block of HP and nothing else.
---
They used to call it Molten Bore.
---
That said, APES have been around on private servers for a long time. They have done Vanilla raids hundreds of times. I'd have been surprised if they didn't smash through MC easily.
---
The last seconds were actually a bit clutch, the fact that Classic is undertuned compared to private servers probably helped.
---
Clearing solved content was never going to take longer to clear than fresh content regardless of difficulty.
---
Classic is for men who appreciate some  difficulty. Retail is for the blind and the lazy who just want to buy mounts and play loot roulette.
---
why are you dungeon grinding if you dont want to?
---
BFA is better in a LOT of ways - you're being a shill with no real reason behind what you're saying.
---
Classic feels more like a faithful and traditional RPG - which is fine.
---
BFA WoW is more like a conquest based RPG - which is fine.
---
To say Classic is objectively better is just an idiotic statement.
---
This aged well.
---
So, somehow your experience is affected by seeing how other people abused layering? Can't really relate to that
---
Now really, I can't recall anything like that, did you just make that up?
---
What I recall from every WF thread since Cata is "MC world first almost took half a year, modern WoW raiding is so easy and braindead compared to vanilla" when end bosses would die within a month of release. Yeah I get it, half of it is trolling but a lot of people who didn't play in vanilla actually fell for this and had a very false sense of how difficult (or in this case, easy) raids used to be.
---
Um....thats because layering is only being used to help zone overcrowding. You're getting a queue because the server you're on is at max capacity. Layering doesn't add more server capacity.
---
I'm not anymore.
---
I don’t give af.
---
I don’t understand celebrity streamer or twitch culture even a little bit, but am enjoying this soap opera drama. So at least there’s that.
---
ah so youre just kindve a loser.
---
I would refer to the guides on wowhead classic, priest discord, etc., for specifics. I'm not currently that far along myself, but putting points into Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap from the start will drastically improve your uptime.
---
Nope, people were just shit and clueless back then.
---
Love entry level raids in an end of cycle patch
---
Do I have to be the one to say it?  This was a demonstration of leveling and planning prowess.  Not of mechanical talent. LOL
---
Stuuuuds
---
Actually yes, we tried to have a complete raid, but sadly most quit mid stranglethorn lol
---
Totally. Bad players are not just contributing less. They actually are a detriment. Ideally you find yourself a competent tank/healer/warlock trio so you can easily slot in new people via teleports. Just keep building a friend list of competent people, it will often come in handy.
---
I don't think this will last long though. It's "Cute" in the lower levels.. but 3-4 weeks from now are you really going to want to be asking the same questions or tabbing back to wowhead?
---
In just a short time, most people are going to experience the quest grind and also the dungeon fall out - people will see how painful some of the dungeons are and will jump back into retail.
---
Now don't get me wrong, i'm absolutely LOVING classic right now and enjoy that sense of community, people buffing each other and PUGs going on for everything...
---
BUT, there will be a day when you don't want to spend 45 minutes at summoning stone... or you don't have the key... or your not attuned... and those gates will limit what you can/can't do and those who can push through this will build up walls against those who don't.

With classic wow, we're doomed to repeat history. Mostly because we know that \*if\* it is successful, it will lead to TBC and future Xpacs &amp; beyond.  TBC is my absolute favorite - but i know, i suffered not seeing or experiencing much of the world until WOTLK because i couldn't ignore my family, friends, job and life and that is the danger of keeping classic pure and eventually ending up at reality again in the future.
---
my 2 cents...
---
(btw, if classic remains perpetually at 60 for eternity i'm not sure the community will last)
---
On yourself
---
MAD HYPE for 201
---
/played is ~20 hours and I'm not 30. That's a part time job worth of time. That isn't even what actual casual playing is. Some people dont ignore their son and partner to level up.
---
I play other games, including retail, so I'm not sure how I fit in all of this other shit and spend less than 40 hours a week on the computer.
---
I don't think you understand what an average player really is
---
I like to make fun of their recruitment spiel.
---
"we will use loot council" does that mean officers get loot before everyone else?
---
It's the Barrens so it's okay to troll.
---
&gt; Nice! Crazy how much faster they were than method, seems like they had a mage heavy comp
---
Method isn't competing and has never been competing. They announced that a month ago.
---
it doesn't help that method wasn't even in the race ofc
---
It's a very very old game.
---

Was waiting for a mob to spawn for a drop. Rogue comes up and asks for an invite.  
---
  
---
I say "I am full Sorry"  
---
"Then where are they?" He replied.  
---
"Down there killing the other mobs."  
---
/y "Just kick one and invite me then dumbass"  he didnt like rejection.  
---
I then /giggle and wait for the mob. 5 minutes later he whispers me. "Enjoy the fuckin wait retard. I got him 1st."  
---
He ended up killing the wrong mob and couldn't unlock the chains to free the prisoner. The correct mob spawns and I get the key for my group and finish the quest. I rp walked away with a /smile directed right at him. He is now on my ignore list due to the things I'm not going to repeat. Felt good. Im glad to be back in azeroth.
---
Spirit tap ftw
---
Still a great point, thanks for the trip down memory lane 😁
---
As rogue until you get stuns I feel like it's important to be ahead of what you're fighting in terms of XP (and even then it's probably still better).
---
Warrior is like that, too.  It's just tough without gear.
---
Vanilla endgame is a joke!
---
You can't transfer between realms currently, idk if it will get added but I don't think so. 
---
As for guides I imagine searching on Youtube is pretty helpfull.
---
Mage or Rogue for solo queue BGs and the odd bit of wPvP?
---
I never said Chinese people their sheets I said the way of life in China the promotes cheating. Pretty sure last time I checked the majority of the people who live in China are Chinese.
---
Please explain how I'm wrong I'll wait...
---
Bfa is an expansion. fact
---
classic is the full original game. fact
---
there isn't a comparison, one is just complete while the other is a shell of its former self. Pick your poison.
---
Rolled on a West coast server (moving there in a month and planned ahead). Playing during East coast mornings has been a breeze.
---
tons of people took a week off work and are just scratching lvl 40
---
In that case screw it. I want nothing to do with any new version of WOW.
---
As someone currently in the food industry, this.
---
Classic is mechanically easier than retail, there's really no argument there.  And I don't think anyone can argue in good faith that classic raids are mechanically challenging compared to retail either.
---
Classic's difficulty comes from the player's relative power to the world.  It's just not possible in classic to pull 8+ mobs while questing and not die.  In retail that's trivial.
---
Somehow some people took a reasonable stance (classic's world is more dangerous, and thus more difficult) and turned it into an unreasonable nonsense (classic is harder than retail in every way).
---
It looks very pretty
---
Cherry picking one comment doesn't prove that this is a common believe, there are always going to be outliers
---
25 60s
---
&gt; especially pre-AQ
---
I guarantee that Naxx will be cleared the day it is released.
---
&gt; let's go APES!!! way to go guys. METHOD WHO????????????????
---
For the love of god so many retards in here thinking Method is competing in classic. They're not. There's no Method guild in classic and the stream is literally a cash grab.
---
There's only 2 retail raiders on sight and it's Sco at level 40 and Rogerbrown at 36

I don't think OSRS combat is harder just more fun
---
I’m super new too, I literally just google WOW Classic guides and tons show up. As for the realms, your character is stuck to the realm, so no free transfers. Apparently there are some things later that are purchasable to transfer, but it’s best to plan your character to be stuck to that realm
---
You can say no all you like but the fact remains that the fact is a fact.
---
Lol.
---
Sorry you're not God you don't get any help institutions for everybody and dictate what's right and what's not.
---
Not to mention
---
Method wasn't in the race
---
This was why a bunch of private server players wanted blizzard to balance the raids differently make rsg have more health or do more damage because the fact that 1.12 gave the players buffs they shouldn't have
---
That would make 15 sub 60s...
---
The tigers are 1.3 or 1.4 i believe.
---
You can tame The Rake from mulgore that has the highest speed for that level. At 1.2. But the worgs in shadowfang also have a 1.2, but they dont have claw.
---
ClassicDB and icy-veins are both great sites with guides and info, expect to be using ClassicDB whenever you have a question and need an answer. 
---
As far as the characters and realms, each realm is separate. A character you make on one realm will only be available on that realm.
---
Roleplay
---
I pay for electricity. Am I devaluing the achievements of those who generate their own? Someone else shouldnt base his they feel about what they achieve by what others pay money for someone else to do for them.
---
The classes are all overtuned compared to 2004. There were a ton of changes to talents and gear that change how powerful many classes are (most notably fury warrior). Add on another decade of theorycrafting and this is the result.
---
Meanwhile method's stream has salty casters gone afk, and people farming ZF on a loop..... Nice attempt to cash in on the hype.
---
Nous
---
This didnt age well.
---
Even in Vanilla, Molten Core was just a matter of having at least 5-10 people who knew what they were doing to carry the rest of the mouthbreathers.
---
Wow. That was fast
---
&gt; Also, as far as realms go, are characters locked to one realm or do they transfer between realms?  
---
characters are locked to their realms so yes you'd have to create a new character if you wanted to play on a different realm.
---
&gt; is there any good videos/ text beginners guides? 
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/](https://classic.wowhead.com/)  has lots of good guides. It would probably be a good idea to look at one for the class you want to play.
---
 I personally am against leveling guides because I don't like having a linear leveling path but it could certainly be helpful since there is no quest helper by default.
---
Nobody can predict your future experience
---
BWL and beyond it was. As much as it is today.
---
And wf lvl 60 Kappa
---
So salty wtf
---
Monkeynews had about 25k viewers during the kill
---
Or out of game
---
&gt; Lolololol, fuck Method
---
Method isn't competing.
---
 [https://m.twitch.tv/ascalontv/clip/LittleIcySpiderCmonBruh](https://m.twitch.tv/ascalontv/clip/LittleIcySpiderCmonBruh)  ouch, you were wrong   
---
"  but no chance Rag is down by Monday in my opinion.  "
---
Im pretty sure they adverted their stream as the race to world first level 60 and rag/ony
---
If you can’t decide just alternate back and forth between the two.
---
Yeah but osrs has some really thought content... with very precise mechanic manipulation...
---
Leatrix can do that too!
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic
---
BB reporting in. We're out there!
---
You are not wrong, this is still insane to me
---
Level 35 pieces and stuff.
---
Girls dont play wow.
---
He said the same thing 4 times
---
Definitely. I'd been using the same weapon type the whole time.
---
:)
---
Well of course it is. I'm speaking on the whole. Not only will be BWL, AQ, and Naxx be cleared day one, there will some guilds that do it without wiping.
---
The 'average' player of today is going to be able to see all of this content just fine. They just need to show up and slam their face onto the frostbolt key.
---
That's exactly what I was looking for! This is what I did in BC and it was a blast. A change of pace from normal questing and grabbing so many mobs made you feel so powerful. Glad to know it can be done in Classic, too. I'll have to check that streamer out, thanks!
---
They're not competing for the love of god how hard is it for you apes to fact check
---
Thanked some priest for fortitude buff earlier today.  He assumed I was being sarcastic about a mob he aggro’d from me or something...  the online gaming community is just so jaded from the MOBA/FPS toxicity that most people just assume the worst lol
---
it had 2x the upvotes of its parent comment.  That only happens when people are sympathetic and bandwagoning.
---
&gt;APES are just a bunch of mongoloids that think they are 200 IQ. Like most idiots who also happen to be dicks they lack any self-awareness. Back on private servers they were some big fish in a small pond, but people soon realized they were way overhyped and overrated.
---
Here's another great one.
---
"Why do so many people believe Method are competing?"   
---
Uh cuz they title their stream "Race to world first".
---
Just wait til our tier sets, then we become GLORIOUS
---
It does/doesn't. I agree that overall just seeing a group in the world does not really add any social value. You could, however, say that by putting people in the world it gives you the possibility to be social interactive while putting them in a dungeon makes it impossible since they are in an instance. For example how many times have you run by a group and buffed someone and they buffed you back? Or helped a tank or something. But I bet you have never helped a dungeon team, have you?
---
Also, I agree I love regular dungeon groups and by no means were my solutions the end all be all. This was a discussion meant to find the best possible solution. Really, in general, to get people to stop aoe farming because that is not what I think dungeons are for as I said in other comments. They are meant for gear.
---
Gehennas server first kill of Ragnaros. Nice job APES!
---
I'm doing a lot better second time around and really this has been the big difference. Just knowing when you've gone too deep and running away has worked real well. Just got to level 10 and I just realised I did it all with the very first dagger you start with 😂
---
The major players had very decent gear.
---
I mean, it’s basically YouTube comments. I watch a few streams but I can’t say I’ve ever paid attention to what people are doing in the chat.
---
99% of people are happy for whoever grabs these world firsts. Ignore the other 1%.
---
Its simple. List out the mechanics for any classic raid and act like people havent seen them 20 times more in the last 15 years. 
---
Nobody has to clear a raid multiple times that's literally seen it all.
---
Thx.
---
Yeah it seems my most used chat features are report and ignore :D
---
I don’t think you really need a guide at this point.  I think you’ll get max enjoyment just by just playing the game.  Ask people in the general chat by starting a message with /1.  People will generally be really helpful, and you will learn way more that way vs just watching guides online.
---
 [This addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlas) and [its module for vanilla maps](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlas-classicwow)  works for you? I have both installed and enabled, and it gives me an LUA error and a notification that it doesn't detect any modules installed.
---
These players have cleared MC so many times, they make a whole sub-game of seeing how fast they can clear it on new servers. There is no content in vanilla they haven't mastered already. If they haven't gotten bored yet, I don't think this will be the time they get bored.
---
HA
---
You're wrong as fuck
---
I blue myself
---
This is actually such a good point that everyone seems to be missing
---
What is a "hard" raid then? Genuinely curious, I'm new to classic
---
Wait, there's no more world pvp in retail?  What's war mode?
---
Macro your pet attack to immolate, as soon as you start casting Voidboi hes on its ass. I’ve luckily not lost nearly as many tags. Immolate, corruption, CoA.
---
Oh stfu
---
It should be more heavily restricted to starting areas. The fact that layering was abused to allow people to reach 60 in a significantly shorter amount of time than was previously possible shows that layering has fundamentally disrupted the game.
---
It is the first clear on classic wow tho
---
Method wasn't ever seriously racing for world first Rag.
---
Huh, interesting. I had always thought you had to be 60 to do the attunement for some reason.
---
Which takes strategy, timing, and unhealthy determination.
---
Dude half the raid ain't even max level. They are essentially naked. How is that not at least a bit telling about the difficulty of the raid.
---
People get this mental defect that causes them to think 'world first ____ ' actually means something. 
---
It doesn't, they just look pathetic.
---
I'd sign up for that.
---
Lmao getting downvoted by mob of angry asmongold fans who still think classic is hard.
---
Pathetic
---
Method isn't competing...
---
It’s not really an accomplishment if they’ve practised on private servers and you can’t change my mind
---
Nah they didn't stream hardly anything until Rag, it brings a lot into question
---
I feel like I’m missing something because I’m not having this difficult of a time.
---
But to transmog you need to have the gear in the first place. So no one is going to transmog t2 shoulder onto a fucking hillmans shoulders
---
I don’t fully understand this argument
---
It died an hour ago buddy
---
You're only the only one looking pathetic.
---
Yes. There's no raid penalty at the moment.
---
Truth
---
the title is half the joke, sorry you didnt understand it :(
---
I will never get the second it took me to close that window back
---
Nice
---
So happy I’m not watching streamers and actually enjoying the game.
---
I use "T"
---
Don't worry, most of the people trying to level asap aren't even the ones that wanted to actually play classic. They will get bored and move on to the next thing they can speedrun soon.
---
It's the "details" damage meter addon that does this for whatever reason. Disable it and the message spam will stop.
---
In queue
---
Damn the memes in this sub are pure fire.
---
One of the most consistent mistakes Blizz makes is spending time to develop awesome features like garrisons and class halls, and then just outright abandoning them.  These are systems that should be designed to grow with the game, not be forgotten..
---
moo\_uk said on stream he slept like 3, 5, 4, 3, 3 hours some something like that, so i guess that checks out?
---
Because the raid itself wasn't ever relevant in the competition. The leveling was the only thing that ended up mattering, so the fact that the raid is braindead easy (mechanically) never came into play.
---
Only because so many people leveled up so fast. The content itself is easy.
---
is there any good videos/ text beginners guides? 
---
- is there a site like this for current WOW systems? Meaning will this guild work for both classic and current expansion? If it's on the site already, I apologize.
---
never underestimate the power of autistic euro neets
---
I enjoy any negativity going to that bald guy
---
Loot?
---
What are you talking about? Blizzard didn't touch anything in the game. They set the game up to patch 1.12 and have gated the content. That's it. They didn't touch any numbers. They didn't change any fights. No HP increases. Nothing. We have 15 years of knowledge and Blizzard threw no curve balls. Gave you the most authentic experience they could based on where they felt was most balanced.
---
I meant in regards to clearing MC first. Calm down. Also, how is that me being angry lol
---
i have the same xD i'm using questie bartender4 details and onebag3 , i haven't tried yet to disable them
---
You could say slander is their “Method”
---
You can't one shot mythic raids like they did with MC, it's tightly tuned and literally impossible without enough gear.
---
Where are all the people who keep saying how much harder classic is than retail?
---
Get the best gear they can get for the largest amount of people in the guild probably.
---
Getting some skull rock PTSD here
---
I've been in LFRs that struggle, lol.  There's always going to be people who are just that bad.
---
So this is what happens when your gov gives you free money I guess? Congrats nonetheless ya damn mongrels !!!
---
Yeah macros can be a lifesaver for stuff like that. There are some good ones here (https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-guide-to-warriors-best-addons-and-macros) but I’m not sure if it will have exactly what you’re looking for, but at least it will be a good start in finding what you need.
---
Or use a wand, often it’s besser than casting anything. Or if close range, I use Immolate/petattack makro:p

---
Hey, did we meet at the Method One acting clinic?
---
Give it 3 months
---
The biggest change in the game is the people... Just ignore the fuckwads and play for yourself. Something I remember from vanilla was rare item comraderie, posting greens in chat to see if anyone could use it before vendoring etc. From what I'm reading, people are so rude you may as well offer just your guild a chance to DE.
---
Laughs in EU RP
---
I feel like a lot of people were already saying this - but even Naxx is probably easier than retail current tier Normal raids, and definitely easier than Heroic. If those can be PUGed regularly these raids will too (Naxx, especially early Naxx, included).
---
Noone thinks that will happen
---
Is that a maga hat
---
Or snipping tool on pc
---
I'm a lv 40 currently mostly primarily Disc specced priest and do 100 DPS just with SWP, Mindblast on CD and Wanding...
---
it's the details addon that causes this
---
Moo was rocking greens, and 15 of them weren't even 60
---
13 year olds are more mature than this asshat.
---
Why is it a good thing for it to be mechanically difficult? 
---
If you are expecting fast paced reaction checks and difficult mechanics you were never going to find that in classic. Classic is not an esport, its not a highly competitive game, its an immersive rpg that focused on class fantasy and rewards time investment above all else (character progression).
---
Try playing a warrior
---
Explain
---
What would you propose instead if alliance get high elves?
---
True you're right
---
This pretty much assumes your idea of fun is getting to the endgame content in the current phase at the last minute? What will they do now? Two words: devilsaur farm. They will now proceed to make more gold in a couple of weeks than they will likely need in their entire Classic experience or close to it. With going all out right now, they have saved themselves an immense amount of time over the next couple of years.
---
ThE LoGiStiCs ThOuGh!!
---
Disable anything involving ilvl in any of your addons.  Especially Details.
---
So your standards is people who don't know what a private server is LMFAOO
---
Bet that he doesn't pay you within 2 weeks?
---
They will have their fun - by dominating the server both economically and militarily.
---
That's why people said not to roll on the APES server.
---
The point is being the first. That's the point of any world first race.
---
Not saying it’s not...but it’s not the norm from anything I have seen or heard of
---
Oh..... wow. I’m dumb.
---
Sure was nice when I was able to make linen bags for the first time
---
Sounds pretty damn rich for a lvl 20?
---
You can run into molten core before that, if you just run through BRD and enter through the real entrance.
---
Not sure when BRD can first be accessed though.
---
You don't have to say it, no.
---
I actually dont think it was possible in vanilla. The XP numbers are way off. Turning a group into a raid disabled quest progress and gimped experience gain.
---
Remember the time they retconned the corruption of Sargeras to allow for the Draenei to be a bunch of playable space goats?
---
Is that with or without changing layers for fast respawns?
---
But it's a game made for vanilla players, not pserver players.
---
Bad luck then I guess. But that shit can happen to any class.
---
also, we were bad really really bad
---
True, and silithus didn't really even exist in the original launch.
---
Roll tide!
---
I'm mobile or I'd do it, but if you google chadfish and click images you should get some results.
---
If I remember in an hour when I get home I'll link some.
---
Mate, there's a difference between hard/easy and complicated/simple. And I don't think anyone denies that mythic raiding is both more complicated and harder, it's the rest of retail that's easy.
---
I ended up soloing my verigans at level 24. Didn't wanna deal with a full sfk run.
---
Ended up doing a full sfk run shortly after for the guild.

They didn’t have 35 level 60s

---
Yeah but BFA has way more content to do. Once you finish leveling in Classic the things to do are nothing compared to BFA.
---
There are some spells which are necessary and should be picked up. Better intellect is probably one of them just like a druid should for sure get mark of the wild.
---
I did. I switched to priest because I wanted to switch the race I was playing, and decided I would give a class I’ve never played a go. Warrior was fine I guess. My main beef was the fact that I felt like I wasn’t really playing so much as watching myself auto attack.
---
On our server it was wed/sat, me and 5 othe rpeople would scrounge the entire server on those days. on wed it'd be 5+ groups doing zg/aq20, on saturday there were about 3 groups doing mc/bwl/aq40, depending on who/what was avilable at the time. There was a group that did some naxx40 but I didn't have a character that wasn't used for it every week so I just didn't attend it. I know they got erally far but if you had a tank capable of doing it you'd be invited by one of the guilds actually going first.
---
"Congrats to APES on the World First(Non-Method) Rag kill"

-Method's Twitter probably
---
Nobody is upset at you being retarded. But please spend more of your money to try and annoy strangers on the internet.

3 raids with multiple difficulties

Oh shit, did Ape kill rag?!

Fuck yeah! That's awesome.

Think what will Happen?
---
/u/vredditshare
---
Found the noob here ! I'm level 22 and A HALF !!!
---
&gt;I just want attention.
---
ah..
---
Classic rotations aren't simplistic? lol
---
Everyone is talking about how easy Vanilla was all of a sudden when people are still leveling lol. Everyone on this thread hasn’t even gotten the rep to do it. 
---
But the leveling will be used as an excuse lmao. Like really? 
---
“Mythic raiding is way harder in retail” 
---
Yet guilds like Method are struggling to NOT finish the full raid in a day. It barely takes them two days to do the entire raid. 
---
Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying Vanilla was extremely hard, but comparing the two is pointless as hell. These dudes have been doing this EXACT same route to MC for yearssssss now. And all of a sudden we are comparing the masses to this one guild.....
---
I just hit 12. You’re fast.
---
go back to retail
---
Are you trying to download the whole client, or the Battle.Net launcher?
---
So your first response is 
---
"Your server is gona be dead in a month"
---
Then the next is
---
"Give it 3 months"
---
Got any more backtracking, superstar?
---
I made plenty valid points about how they couldn't have possibly done it the only point you came back with was oh you don't agree with them so you're wrong no can you please prove it any sick way that they fucking did it or no?
---
I've been thinking an awful lot about why this game has been more exciting and enjoyable from level 1-10 than 1-120, and I've come to a moderately simple answer:
---
You're not being rushed.
---
Everything takes *time* to accomplish. **Accomplish**. In BfA, you are rushed through an experience because there is so goddamned much content, and you are spoonfed upgrade after upgrade to get you there as fast as possible.
---
If BfA had the same pacing as Vanilla, it would take an extremely long time to get to level cap going through every bit of content, and nobody would want to play because of it.
---
As it stands, BfA has attempted to cure the disease by figuratively amputating limbs - your character is too strong to handle these mobs, so we're taking away your spells. Blizzard has decided they would rather keep their content rather than let their players keep their characters, and ultimately, Vanilla makes you feel *more* in character because you end up getting to know everybody along the way.
---
People stuck in Barrens for *hoooours*. People stopping by Org for training and trading. People just on their way by.
---
Everybody is happy to be a part of it. Everybody is in on the jokes. It's fucking wonderful.

BS, R3 is the highest pvp rank you can get at 19.
---
do you really think that a normal human being would invest tens of thousands of hours into raiding same stuff for years like they do?
---
Benediction bros represent!
---
good bot
---
Meanwhile I just killed Ishamuhale
---
This is the first and easiest raid. This is also 1.12 and not the original difficulty.
---
Some of them get paid more than you do for playing wow.
---
The only time the grace period doesn't work is server restarts/crashes
---
I have never felt so jealous in my life.
---
If its for vanilla players it would have been launched at 1.0 instead of 1.12.  The difference in power of many classes is vast between 1.0 and 1.12 due to buffs, gear possibilities and loot table changes. It's not just nostalgia, or rote memorization that made APES absolutely steamroll MC just now. Lots of bosses in the lesser raids were tweaked to make it easier for noobs to get gear.  Catchup mechanics were added too.
---
If you already have a sub, theres no reason not to try.
---
Classic is a completely different thing from Retail. Take your time and enjoy the adventure :)
---
Bears, Beats, Battlestar Galactica.
---
It's more of an event promoting their brand around Classic than them actually competing. Only the GM and one of their officers is actually "playing", and they are just leveling. The other streamers are just part of the Method organization.
---
do you want 1 or 5 blood drops
---
Feel free to correct these numbers if I'm wrong, but
---
+ Normal Attack = 100%
---
+ Crushing Blow = 150%
---
+ Critical Hit = 200%
---
+ It's impossible to get Critical Hit Immune
---
+ Anything that was a Critical Hit couldn't be a Crushing Blow in the first place (due to how the attack table works).
---
***
---
Assuming those numbers are right/you accept those numbers, think about the uncrushable argument for just a moment.
---
Did you not watch the stream? BiS consumables weren't used but they did have some.
---
The only stats that have ever been important have been health and damage. You have never seen Blizzard (at least I haven't), talk about adjusting resistances, armor, or anything else but Damage and Health, which we have the stats for. People know how much health Rag has and how much damage he does. The rest is irrelevant.
---
 that's overgeared people
---
Funny how most of them didn't have a guild or didn't have a guild interested in doing the fights. Or hell didn't even HAVE guilds on their servers who would do that content(hello merged uldaman ravencrest, we see you).
---
I mean I just wanted to simplify my beginning attacks and you helped greatly with that. Now I'm trying to figure out how to make my right click my wand rather than melee.
---
These players are all very skilled though. You can’t just go join apes
---
What do you mean nothing matters? Don't compare your own achievements to other peoples' too much. Set goals for yourself and when you achieve them, be happy with yourself. It doesn't matter what other people have achieved.
---
but that... doesn't really mean anything?
---
tbc is better than classic but it's an "expansion"
---
Do you count....resetting instance? Or set up or any.... You know what your right.....
---
Difficulty? 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Fuck warlock is so accurate
---
Ppl were noobs back then mate. Classic raids are LFR difficulty, modern players are better, smarter, faster!
---
I was originally a gnome player back in the day and it amazed me how I was always the priority target in any pvp scenario.
---
Free wifi on WestJet.
---
Update display drivers. Can be found in Device Manager or the graphics card software. 
---
Might help if you had some hardware info.
---
It says “Make Azeroth great again” so kinda yes
---
Im on a full NA server, never had a queue. Not even on launch. Everyone logs in and says "WHOOOF 2 hour queue" and I say, I litterally rebooted my computer to apply updates not 30 secs ago and had no queue getting back in... I dunno whats up, but loving it.
---
who is method
---
Bro everyone keeps posting queue memes in here and non of us care
---
Well the 'brand' isn't looking too great right now.. LOL.
---
I often see people selling them for something like 1.80 silver on my realm. I always hesitate between warning them about npc sell price, and buying their stock and cashing it in myself.
---
On the AH I don't hesitate though. It's already automated.
---
idk who this method is 
---
bfa guild???
---
How do you turn it off?
---
Depends on the spec.
---
Some specs are incredibly undercooked, like Shadow. The shadow levelling rotation is literally Shadow Word Pain then wand ad nauseum.
---
I’m maining a Hunter in Classic and the only ability I haven’t used regularly out of the 12+ I’ve learned up to level 16 is Mongoose Bite, and that’s because MB is an absolutely shit version of Overpower that does no damage.
---
Its one of the many small inaccuracies of pservers.
---
3 whole figures?!
---
Same here brother. I'm just enjoying the world on my way.
---
Because Method has spent the last 5+ years achieving world firsts while the pserver players have been doing the exact same thing over and over and over again ? 
---
If APES rolled on retail next expansion do you think they'd compete with Method for world firsts? Would it make sense to mock them for that? 
---
This subreddit is insane lol
---
Filling pants in 3...2...1... LOK'TAR OGAR!!!

Thanks I'll have to get diff dmg meter or you know a way to fix that.. Ty
---
Say no to drugs
---
No, People have been crying for vanilla server options since cataclysm. Some before but cataclysm really pushed a lot of people over the edge.
---
Go online, find a friend and kill a mob in a 2-man-party and a 2-man-raid. The experience stays exactly the same opposite to the vanilla.
---
Expand the test; in a 10-man-raid, a player earns at the moment half of the XP he would earn in a 5-man-group, though the 10-man-raid should not only lack the party bonus (+40% the group has) but also have a raid penalty of -50%. Ultimately, a player in a 5-man-group should earn 28 % of the mob kill XP, and a player in a 10-man-raid should earn 5 % of the mob kill XP. 
---
I did test these both. It's as if there's no raid penalty at all.
---
I started Pally last night and picked mining and jewel crafting, but after some research I have been informed that if you intend to PvP seriously then you pretty much need Engineering and mining works well with engineering because of the metals needed.
---
what? a "server full" meme?
---
no this is the first one
---
Ya, I wasn’t sure. I know method is like a professional organization who’s raiders get incentives for going world first etc. I mean like you said, wow isn’t an overly complicated games. It’s a grind is all.
---
Do the low level quests in loch modan then go to darkshore (You should get at least 3 levels) then go back to loch modan and do the higher level quests. You should be about lvl 20 at this point. For the brotherhood quests you need to go to redridge and it sends you back to westfall then you have to kill the messenger and escort the traitor. You shoudl do these steps before running dm bc of the rewards (unless you plan to run it multiple times)
---
Gotcha. Saw the ford and the ass time and just assumed lol.
---
I saw a documentary on the top European players and most of them are trust fund babies or independently wealthy. They dont have to work. The remaining players have like 8 weeks paid vacation provided by their countries government.
---
Indeed! Very nice server first
---
They stated they had to wait a few hours because their hunter wasn't 60 to learn tranq, bit apparently 1 is enough.
---
That dude is so screwed. He won't even be able to get back to his body.
---
Warlocks don’t use dots in dungeons or raids in vanilla if you are playing optimally. They are shadowbolt bots.
---
Wow, I never have had this much attention on reddit. Thanks for the upvotes and  [/u/frakkinadama](https://www.reddit.com/u/frakkinadama)  for gold. Love this game, catch me on Incendius.
---
That's exactly it, compared to who.
---
The market has changed. People often don't realize that because the price hasn't changed in nearly forever ($60 mark), when accounting for inflation it means that grand projects of old would more likely cost in the $100 now (more customers don't change much because this has gone up with prod costs too). Hence DLC, subs / pass etc.
---
The sad part is that breaking up the content in such chunks (to reach those $100-ish total per primary customer) is too often done at the cost of a fundamental premise of "equality" in games, i.e. content is stupidly gated because it needs to be monetized, instead of being gated because "difficulty" or "storytelling" (i.e. make sense within the game world, self-consistency). Online + pay2win doesn't help, obviously, lots of trends make a bad situation worse.
---
Now on a positive note. I've seen two such eras for the audiovisual (movie/tv) industry.
---
I grew up in the late 80s and was exposed to "all the great stuff" from that era and before, and this was the time when Hollywood and Cable had their formulas pretty figured out, so innovation was an all-time low — we were getting the same soup, rarely as good as the originals. It lasted about ten years, maybe 15, and then Tv picked up with HBO notably, and shows like BSG who took things "up one big notch". Nowadays fast forward to the Netflix era etc. and there's anew way too much good stuff to watch it all.
---
I hope, I feel, video games will become have another golden era, after the 1990's golden age of early PC and mature 16-bit consoles. It'll come out of nowhere but suddenly someone will find a new formula, a new paradigm that just works both from a storytelling and production standpoint — like the transition from "1 short story per episode, rinse and repeat" to "one single ultra-long-length feature/story, split up in episodes". There's a new paradigm waiting for games somewhere down the line where it becomes magical anew for players, as a feeling, and practical in terms of state-of-the-art production.

Apparently some Private Servers made rag harder than he actually was in classic.
---
Checking in! I was saying it would take longer than a week. I was wrong as fuck lol
---
Collect all the quests for a dungeon before you go in it. Strictly speaking, doing dungeons is not an "efficient" way to level, but just running a dungeon once with all the quests that come with it is pretty close, and can get you some nice gear, and really, isn't making our pixel numbers go higher what we're all here for?
---
One sword hitting with base 95% hit chance = .95*dps

lvl 20 frost mage right now, thinking about switching over to fire spec because frost is kinda boring when every mage i see is using it. also i like crits and big numbers but ive always see people say fire is not as good as frost so i went frost at first but yeah not really feeling it anymore. is fire spec worth it? also how is the corsair overshirt from VC? just got it but idk how good spirit is for mage
---
Honestly with the pace some people are going, theyre going to have phase 1 cleared by next week
---
Most of the people that are coming back have not been in the classic world for 14 years. Even the hardcore players coming back are still trying to lvl up. I am not saying that MC is hard, but most of the people are going to use a lot more than weeks on it. 
---
APES are private server guys that practice over and over, do the same content over and over. Ofcourse they will shit on everything. But i wished they would stay on the private servers, somehow i think this just ruin the experience for us returning and new to classic players.
---
They will have no competetors in arena, they will have no competetors in pve, its onesided and it's boring.
---
Anyway, back to slow grinding with my friends.
---
Depends what you count as average, I imagine most groups raiding 2-3 nights a week are going to progress a lot slower. A lot of players will be just chilling out and having fun questing, making new friends etc.
---
If you're not already an established community getting 30-40 people to turn up on time with consumables and not have drama is going to be a decent amount of work (or for older players getting all your healers and tanks to turn up without jobs and family commitments getting in the way). 
---
Most average guilds are a far far less organised for forming levelling groups, or getting groups together to farm money / consumables / gear.
---
A lot of players will be coming back to the game without having played private servers and will also need a bit of time to learn their class / a new class. ( I know I do).
---
Players are going to definitely know a lot more about game mechanics between streams, youtube content etc. Hopefully 15 years of not standing in the fire and trying not to blow up the raid counts for something.
---
I dunno if its a fair comparison but pugging time walking black temple was brutal, I'd expect some of the vanilla content to be similar. While BT is definitely more mechanically complicated than some (a lot of?) vanilla fights you would still expect players to be able to pull of the fights without people rage quitting, going afk, needing to be replaced, wiping the raid with the Flames of Azzinoth etc. but nope still took a ton of attempts.
---
&gt;quoting abomb
---
Ok. I'll critique the technique in that [pally tanking example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acM3bN0H3Rc) He is turning and getting hit in the back and dazed. Don't do that. Being dazed the instant feedback you did something wrong and need to correct. Instead sideways strafe so you move at full speed while keeping your shield facing the mobs. When he gets hit with frost bolt and other snares he should immediately cast blessing of freedom on himself. +speed enchant on the boots would also help. When healers cast heals, he should have hit them with the hammer stun.
---
What I liked is that he broke line of sight. You always want to do that as much as possible. The main thing I liked is he PULLED THE FUCK BACK. Classic mobs will run away when they get low. They attempt to aggro the nearest group. A pally tank can easily pull 4 groups at the same time at the start. However 4 groups arriving sequentially is brutal for a paladin and the group. You never want that.
---
Why do people feel the need to come on here and tell others how to play? Some people like the competitive rush. Let them be.
---
Lol come on now. That classic model looks rough.
---
I haven't downvoted anyone first off.
---
Second, I don't get what you two are trying to say with this meme of "classic full game. BFA expac" thing. BFA is also a full game - built up from the "full game, classic".
---
Classic WoW has braindead rotations. Frostbolt spam is not by any stretch of the imagination difficult or engaging. The fights are easier and have simple mechanics. Gameplay is slower. 
---
These are not debated claims - weather you think that those are pros or cons really depends on what you want out of it. 
---
BFA is a much harder - much more engaging game from a combat perspective with a lot of the RPG elements taken out.
---
No more rogue poisions - professions are basically handed to you without ANY work - you don't use any gear you'll craft past the first week of play etc.
---
There IS a comparison - and you're a fool who cannot see the world in anything other than black and white if you're going to say something as silly as 
---
&gt;"There isn't a comparison, one is just complete while the other is a shell of its former self. Pick your poison."
---
so whats your point ?
---
Macros macros macros.  
---
Having all your skills macro'd up is so helpful as a paladin. Including /Autoattack on seals and judgements, multiple different spell ranks, left click to cast, right click to cancel a buff like blessing of protection etc, etc. A weapon swap macro (sword+board vs 2hander) is extremely handy. Especially at the end of a pull when you have a full stack of reckoning and are fighting a caster that you can't block anyway. It's called a reckoning bomb for a reason. If you are OP for an area, don't be afraid to /sit as part of a hotbar macro. You'll get critted and proc reckoning.
---
/script SpellStopCasting() is important before most abilities. Bubble+bandage is amazing while leveling. Same with Bubble+hearth. Instead of a mere hearthstone on your hotbar, it looks like a hearthstone but any time you hearth, the macro always tries to cast bubble first. Saves annoying respawns etc keeping you from logging out when you want. (One mob aggroing at time as you try and quit can easily take 5-10mins from interruptions.) You also want a macro to to be able to hotbar a skull on mobs. Also don't be afraid to deliberately lose threat on skull to your group. Especially if it is a healer. Let your group stun it. Pick a different target as your own personal primary. It will stay alive for a while that you can judge +healing or +mana onto. (DPS does not matter, total time spent including recovering hp &amp; mana for the group is what matters.)
---
Do all the [paladin quests](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin/Quests) for spells and abilities as soon as possible. For example Redemption (res) is a quest. Do it asap. If you see a corpse, res it. Odds are high you will make a friend and at least get a buff. If you see a mage, it doesn't hurt to ask for some conjured food/water.
---
Get buffs. Well fed buffs will help. As will junk scrolls. The best buff for a leveling pally is thorns. If you have hammer talented then it can be used both at the start and end of a typical pull. A pure stun is still a dps boost. Because a stunned mob isn't dodging and now your group is critting the mob.
---
So are most classic raid fight video
---
Ah, I won't be PvPing. I might just pick up Mining, though.
---
You heard it straight from the horses mouth, private servers were harder than retail. Private servers played the only actual difficult version of Vanilla to ever exist. Enjoy your watered down retail version :)
---
Noob question, but how do you get healthbars/nameplates in that position?
---
I'm over on mixer. Definitely smaller obviously. Mostly the same minus big time streamers
---
I might be wrong here due to not understanding macros and doing everything manually, but I do know every time you press "start attack" it's toggling "start attack" then if you press it again it's basically "stop attack".  For example if attack is bound to 1, I press 1 and I will attack, but if I press 1 again I will stop attacking and stand still.  It's like an on and off.  Perhaps with the way your macro is set up when you're spamming it's doing something similar?
---
Probably will have to do runecloth
---
It was done so fast on a regular basis on fresh pserver launches. And classic is pretty hardcore, just not MC so much, plus the hardcore part comes more from time investment required. It's funny though, so many people will see this and think they will faceroll MC. It's only so easy if you know every fight in that place and your job in it. An inexperienced group of people who walks in there will get slapped around a fair bit at first.

Take the zep to org and run rfc, people will share quests. Definitely worth it to run most dungeons once at least for the quests.  Excellent experience and good quest items/ boss loot.  That will then help you quest more.  Then do wc in a few levels.

You're experiencing it. Vanilla and Classic aren't identical. And even if the games were, the people's mindsets aren't.

---
I literally listed the reason why I discounted them after I wrote why and none of them were because they invalidated my argument and sure dissect my argument. 
---
Ok, I have now read your post so I will reply step by step as it seems easier to understand that way.
---
First point: Sure... But you are holding all things constant. Why would you do that? I assumed that things were not constant since this is an argument for people in dungs vs them not in dungs? If you do not hold things constant which I believe is the right assumption then there is no correlation with boosted xp. For instance if I make it so you kill a man in a dungeon you get 200 xp instead of a man in the world who is 100 xp then you get more xp per hour if you kill the same amount of men. But dung mobs are way harder than what you grind in the world so why would u assume a group of 5 in and outside of a dung would clear the same amount of them?
---
Second Point: Again do not see how this is relevant to the maximum amount of xp an hour tho. If you want to get the maximum amount of xp per hour in the real world you need to keep your group together for an hour as well. Assuming we are actually talking about long-run best xp per hour and not burst such as 10-30 min xp per hour. Also couldn't you literally make the same argument about the dungeon that you could grind part of the dungeon for 10 mins and then dip?
---
Third point: I am literally so confused? Do you understand what I was arguing about? The argument is that for certain levels aoe dung grinding without quests should not be the best xp per hour vs literally all other things in the game. I am not sure what this has to do with people doing quest in dungeons and those xp rates.
---
Fourth Point: ???????? I am really lost at this point. This is an omnipotent analysis of 5 man in dungs vs 5 mans without. has nothing to do with what you are expected or what even actually does happen?
---
Fifth point: Sure but the overall point was you do not really kill that many bosses in dungs. The majority of the xp from the aoe dungs comes from mobs.
---
Last point: Sure I assumed we were talking per level. Ya but the problem is that dungeons give gold too lol. They literally give everything. Why quest when it is sub par in every way. You literally did not answer the question. Why would blizzard implement a method of farming that was best xp per hour, good gold, and best gear for the level range. And the answer is the didnt or least did not mean too. Also I am literally gonna try and find the video of one of the lead vanilla dung guys who said this was not wat it was meant for. So according to the literal person who designed the dung your analysis would be wrong.
---
I member
---
you make no sense.
---
good night.

Yeah I'm gonna go with the company that has an actual working version of 1.12 over some bored developers who had to guess each bosses values.

Yes!

I said it, I didn't think they'd get tanks to 60 with enough tank gear week 1. They did it in 5 days 2 hours....
---
Someone should inform them of their stream title.
---
I got flagged bcuz My name was Kneegrowz, good luck
---
Why u talking if u have no idea about it?
---
This. The problem with modern WoW is that they took away the incentive to be social. If quests are too easy, you don't need to group up to do them. If you can just pop onto Dungeon Finder to do dungeons, you don't need to talk to anyone to find a group. If you can use LFG to pug any raid, there isn't much of a point to guilds. 
---
Without the social aspect, WoW is a pretty boring game. Especially when everything below M+ is a faceroll anyway.
---
There is no arena
---
same here on herod.

Pagle.  Was one of the originals before all the extras added on launch day so I assume it's decently busy most of the time.  I guess them raising the server cap+playing at non-peak hours is what has helped
---
Internet connection used to be the largest hindrance for people to complete raids IMO. When WoW came out, the majority of the USA was still using dial up or had just recently got some form of DSL. Now that the average connection for a dedicated gamer/streamer is upwards of 200 Mb/s , the response time for heals and removing debuffs isn't even a factor anymore. 
---
But then again, I'm a complete scrub when it comes to WoW.
---
Thank you!

Anyone who's in a top 1k in retail could easily be good enough for any classic/pserver guild if they put in the effort to learn the game.

You are either delusional, never really played vanilla or straight up lying to yourself to protect your nostalgic fantasy world memories. All of vanilla end game was a complete joke. Doesn't matter if it was 1.0 or 1.12, the content was easy as fuck. The hardest part of raiding in vanilla was getting 30+ people together at the same time and praying for the dsl gods for a stable connection for a couple of hours.

Dude, I actually liked TBC better because it still had a lot of the quirks of vanilla while still having better balancing.  I'm not saying Legion wasn't good, I'm just saying that I enjoyed vanilla more so.
---
I usually toss a dot or 2 on my lock
---
I think I am going to roll a human rogue when I get home tonight. The only thing that I am hesitant about is their lack of self-sustainability.
---
You cant do that in raids lol
---
I think you're getting downvoted for trashing on a game that a lot of people are enjoying themselves with. I think anyone who is familiar with vanilla know that Rag would get killed very quickly. But if you spent more than 5 minutes on this sub reddit you would know that the general consensus is this game isn't about downing difficult bosses.
---
the smartest thing you can say is MC is easy as fuck on classic. Where you able to farm dungeons super hard on lightshope? nope. But you can in classic. Lightshope would over tune raids (which is a good thing in classic at this point) and dungeons to make the game more challenging. Prepare for every raid to be curb-stomped just like MC by every single pug
---
rikh plays pservers
---
Good job man! Keep it up.
---
Lol did all of you really have to take your shirts off?
---
Just bought a Microsoft sculpt. Moved the keyboard from the tray to the top of the desk and raised / titled my seat forward. Let's see how that goes.
---
It has been cleared week 1 on every private server in recent memory. Remember that while 45 is the half way point you get significantly more xp at that stage.
---
High key Mythic+ is also infinitely harder than anything in classic
---
Keep in mind that there are some good classic addons that don’t show up in twitch.
---
I don't think he's wrong though, apes are obviously great at classic because theyve been practising for years on private servers, but method is still by far the better guild with more achievements.
---
I know everyone is bandwagoning on the method hate train for some reason, but apes have one achievement, method have tons. 
---
And lets not pretend MC is some super hard raid or needs anything close to the skill and preparation and gear of something like mythic azshara
---
I’d be doing Wailing Caverns. If not just for the fun of it you should be doing it for the 10 a lot bag you get from a quest outside the dungeon.
---
Best for flight paths! Everyone needs to download peggle for full vanilla experience.
---
Method only plays classic to stream something in their fancy studio. It's sad
---
Well, I found remaining conscious was challenging sometimes.
---
&gt;not because they were desperate to cater to pserver players.
---
I mean I get that.  I wasn't pitting pservers vs retail or something, there's just some significant class changes between release that also contribute to the overall easiness of running MC
---
Here's some changes:
---
1)Sons of Flame now despawn when everyone wipes.
---
2) he Golemagg and Shazzrah encounters in the Molten Core has undergone some changes.
---
3) The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now always happen while Ragnaros is in combat. However, these lava eruptions occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.
---
That said there were changes they made to bugs that were exploitable along the way.
---
There is a shortcut to get to the harbor from dying close to ironforge.  Look up on YouTube save yourself a 20 min run or so

---
Because they remember it being harder as there was alot less knowledge back then and don't realize that certain things no longer apply
---
Eat your hat on twitch!!
---
Did you expect a secret phase?
---
Lvl 15 here
---
I dunno.  Was that stated somewhere?
---
Rightfully so I'd be in shock to if someone just randomly sent me a blue
---
Let's just hope they survive
---
You will be fine, I leveled two warriors to 60 in vanilla
---
Am I the only one who has never ever had a random epic drop?
---
I wounder if this is any help at all.
---
1.0 warriors didn't gain rage, like at all. Warriors were absolutely awful in 1.0
---
Honest question, how long did it take to clear the first raid in Legion or BFA? Much more difficult content so I'm guessing it took a really long time?
---
Gz means congratulations.
---
We have it first Sunday in September.
---
Imagine actually having a clue and realising that there is no method classic raid team that is competing for world first amd their stream is just celebrating wow classic / making money
---
I genuinely dont see how paladins are so much worse design wise than the others. Spamming deathbolt/frostbolt the entire fight isnt incredible design either.
---
Theyve already shown their raidlockout on stream and logged in and out of the server so you can see what server they are logging into.
---
They killed rag with 26 60s and most people still had pieces from scarlet monastery, almost everyone is in 50% greens and they 1 shot every boss.
---
People have been saying everything "seemed" undertuned. Its not that its undertuned its that classic was always this easy in 1.12 after all the catchup mechanics were added in.
---
The leveling is the most impressive part but this is a group of people that know how to power level
---
Sure at low level when you run around with less than 10g you barely make any money from quest rewards anyway I also disenchanted everything but once I hit 33ish I stopped because picking the most expensive quest reward is on average 50s on top of the 50s most quests give and you can't really sell souldust or either of the higher essences on my server.
---
And silk cloth is less than 3s each on the ah so I could always just buy silk to turn it into more money instead of grinding mobs that have a chance to drop &lt;3s. But apparently there are mobs that drop a ton of gold according to others I just haven't found them.
---
Cheekbones so sharp, he can cut his own hair.
---
I didn't think it was possible to get 40 people at (or close to) max level in that time frame. But I wasn't surprised either when I saw the speed at which they were leveling.
---
The average player still won't touch lvl 60 content for another 2-3 months.
---
You are correct, but not having innervate as a baseline ability would not have saved Rag from getting his ass kicked within a week. 
---
Of course, factors like older talents and progressive itemization add up, but they were thrown into a trashcan and 15 year old game is still a 15 year old game.
---
Or fear it into every other pack in the zone
---
It is not 30 minutes at character select screen.
---
I have timed it and so has other people. I set a time for reminding me after 40 minutes and I was greeted with the "you have been disconnected" message.
---
Yes
---
More than likely within hours of release.
---
Nothing to do with rag, everything to do with cutting APES down.
---
APES already cleared Rag an hour ago.
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Question: is there a tool you haven't got? Good lord. Very impressive stuff. It ascended me to a new level of appreciation for woodworking.
---
Lol how is it a money grab? It's clear they spent a shit tonne of effort to put together a good show to celebrate release.
---
I’m on Fairbanks to avoid the streamers
---
At this point it's mostly the PvP servers that are overstuffed.
---
self heal generates agro/hate for mobs but i'm not sure if they'll engage if they weren't already.
---
i highly suggest a wand and the wand talent. then add Shoot (skill) to your action bar.
---
I still can’t get on my Herod characters sitting at level 1.
---
Canconfirm.  
---
Leveling with a rogue as well. I'm tank and healer. For the first couple levels I was tank, healer and DD :D
---
How did they get so many dousers?
---
The practice of buying gold totally fucked WoW up. The entire economy went to shit.  Seriously don't buy gold it's a cancer on the game.
---
It's hilarious watching all the zero changes people ask for harder raids after months of circlejerking about how much harder vanilla is than retail.
---
Honestly not an issue to me, I miss proper pug raids and dragonpot / gold pot raids, I made good gold doing those, as long as in sever pugs are common I'm keen for this to be quite honest, cross realm pugs were a fucking horrid idea
---
It's been done before. It's not unexpected at all, sure its impressive they did it first but it's not even the first time for that. Not by a long shot.
---
Took me 9 goretusks to get the 8 boar livers. 
---
My luck for the rest of the game.
---
Found the SJW. You need thicker skin of that stuff bothers you enough to make a point of pointing it out. Did you catch Dave Chappelle's new Netflix special? I highly recommend it!
---
We call them armchair experts, because they always know best.
---
Queues*
---
Well that’s what the term average joe means. The average male adult American.
---
Yeah, it will change a bit more in the upcoming phases too, other guilds will be around to compete and you'll have some big wpvp going on to try and block/disrupt raid nights.
---
The push to clear rag was just who could get the most people to 58+ plus on the least amount of sleep.
---
TIL
---
Represent boy! 15!
---
Oh, hell no. You have to upgrade the damage stuff. I just mean, like, don't take EVERY spell. Every class has a lot of spells that are either superfluous or totally useful at rank 1.
---
Naxx will be cleared wipe less on first day of release. bet?
---
I must be doing something wrong as Hunter.  I die a lot lol!
---
Pretty accurate to me on the Westfall server haha
---
Do u have a link to that vod?  Also I thought bgs were a later phase?
---
this is false, it is currently in WoW Classic.
---
Because you work in brackets. High pop servers could have like 5 people in the upper bracket earning points, while lower pop servers could have 0. Essentially meaning you won’t be earning nearly as much ranking points since you actually need that upper bracket to have a net gain. It’s been more than a decade  so don’t ask me for numbers. But I’m sure with the release of classic people will have done the math on it
---
Confident in my decision for paladin in vanilla. I've always loved the class fantasy and the role you get from Paladin.
---
In raids, I'm fine going full holy healing. But in PvP, I am hoping to do some damage, regardless of any spec. I like dueling, being able to kill people on my own, etc.
---
What is the best way to build paladin for this? My current googling seems to be pointing towards T2 Shockadin build
---
it’s details, turn off the show ilvl setting
---
A very annoying word to spell
---
They were 15-man at launch.
---
I believe he's using Questie and Vendor Prices Classic.
---
It would be pretty damn funny if he just climbs up out of his hole and starts walking around like his later appearance
---
Because it was nothing special, they killed this boss xxx times already, its like dungeon boss for them.
---
BLOOD-shot eyes AND THUNDER thighs!
---
The Freudian symbols of massive trains plowing through a tunnel.
---
RemindMe! 8hours
---
start a group or ask to join a group.  find skills that are instant cast/damage then fear or just take one and kill it then move to the next.
---
also this is after their GM said they'd be competing for world first in every phase and that "we will have no problem against these private server guilds" 
---
Method is on a serious PR move in this thread lmao
---
lol I had a guild master last year that was *insistent* that you ***absolutely require*** 8 tanks with 4 piece tier 3 before you can clear 4HM....the day 1 naxx kill I'd love to hear what he has to say. He'd probably say "that's not how it was back in the day."
---
I don’t understand these comments. Method was not trying to get world first rag. This world first raid is literally which group of people had the most efficient routes and the least amount of life. MC is easy
---
You can verify this I’m guessing, just because you didn’t see it doesn’t mean it wasn’t around.
---
There's a talent called spirit tap. Time your last hits right and you'll rarely run out of mana.
---
Real talk though, ESO is one of the better MMORPGs out there. Improved a lot since release.
---
Where do you get that addon? I found one but it's for retail
---
&gt;If you put the best private server players up against the best retail players, the retail players will absolutely smash them.
---
You do realize Method was going for world first also and they lost?
---
Is that vod hanging around?  Id love to see that bg
---
The attunement for MC is just to teleport you in. You can just do the dungeon and get to it that way.
---
25
---
Can’t wait for low level players to get camped for honor after all the “pvp is better in classic” I’ve heard.
---
And making sure you keep your wand up to date.
---
The harder you work to maintain the story to hide the cracks the harder it will get
---
I'm surprised too.
---
&gt; Classic is harder overall.
---
You muse be lunatic.
---
Anal Jazz?
---
Thank you. I talked to her while she didnt show anything and completed the quest for the twice time?. Well I think it works now.
---
You're thinking 1999, not 2004. 1600x1200 LCD and cable internet was common by then, with widescreen displays becoming commonplace as well.

What's this for ?

Nah Saturday is good.
---
yeah, i remember tanking looking at the floor
---
dont worry plenty of guilds will struggle in MC
---
It's called taking a week vacation off from work for classic release - lots of them have full time jobs. Also Ragnaros is dead now, they got it, gg.
---
Lmao reading comprehension is failing these days I see.
---
Man I thought this was loss for a second.
---
I’m willing to admit I didn’t believe. I thought it’d be after the next lockout. 
---
Fair play to them, gotta say, that’s a lot of dedication and long hours to knock all the shit they had to do our so fast. Congrats y’all you’ve earned it.
---
No. If he deleted his account, the page would say deleted. OP either has the wrong name, or the admins banned him.
---
Auto hotkey sends hardware input, warden can't detect that.
---
Eat the hat!
---
they have been around since nost. they arnt going anywhere.
---
No one is mad that they aren't playing right now, everyone is just rightly calling you out for having been part of the problem. Gold sellers go away if no one is buying gold.
---
The fact that several of them aren't even 60 makes me glad I rolled the shadow priest I wanted to. If you're competent, you'll be able to raid regardless of class/spec because it's really not that hard.
---
What’s happening here?
---
You’re delusional if you think end game classic is hard in any capacity. On private servers salad bakers full cleared the raid in a little over an hour. The whole vanilla was harder than retail thing is just nostalgia and people that only clearing normal difficulty
---
This made me laugh
---
If something isn't impossible, and you have essentially unlimited time to practice (14 years seriously), then you absolutely should be able to get it done. It doesn't mean classic is easy, it just means classic is easy when someone hands you the optimal strategies, optimal raid setup, optimal gearing, even optimal paths to reach those points, and then they give you 14 years to practice...
---
Can you name any game that you think is so hard that even after 14 years of practice it would still be a struggle?
---
Got a priest at 12 myself. I didnt realize how awful leveling a priest would be but at least I know at max level I'll probably be a hot commodity when it comes to dungeon groups because only so many people can make it through this leveling process.
---
you made me chuckle +1
---
Said deleted when I clicked on it so that’s what I wrote
---
The gold buy services ruin WoW.  It's 100% cheating.  It's why Blizzard had to go in the direction they did with WoW so that the gold spammers didn't completely end it.
---
Is that some sort of taunt?
---
what mages pull like 15 of them at once world is only hard if your bad. Game was only ever hard because everyone had shit connection/pc and were bad players.
---
There's an argument that the most rabid Vanilla playerbase were the ones most incentivized to play on private servers...
---
I also found a noob *laughs in level 23*
---
That doesn’t sound very fun lol
---
Going to go learn that now because its brilliant
---
Yeah I kind of hit an extreme though of doing Darkshore 'til about 16 and then going over to Westfall when most of the early stuff is green or now gray on leveling up to 17... then I did Deadmines last night so I'm in an awkward spot where I still need to do most of the Deadmines build-up quests but they're mostly green at this point.
---
Nah, there's these elementals in the west
---
I wonder how many tries it took. 1 tranq shot means none can miss.
---
I'm west coast but play a east coast server. I havent noticed anything weird with that
---
You already brought me joy. You go rest you weary weary ~warrior~ hunter.
---
Right. That’s what is impressive about this feat. The time constraint under which they did it. Fucking everyone and their dead puppy killed ragnaros at some point.
---
This has been proven false. Dungeons give way more exp than was expected, even without quests
---
As a Warlock I feel that pain so goddamn hard.
---
I'm a proud lvl 17 human lock. Just made it to Darkshore, so my day has been great
---
I'm happy these firsts are from people I haven't heard of before. Gives teams like Method some proper competition :)
---
The second race technically.  They lost the first one.  The leveling probably was the only one I was curious about just to see how fast someone would do it and it was very impressive.
---
I feel like that's pretty much just required. I think the main debate you have as a priest is which to get first. I'm currently going Spirit Tap first but I'll get back to you about that haha.
---
You're right, it's required.
---
i’m not part of your “we” ser. some of us are coming from ffxiv
---
Most of the pre raid gear is gained in the 50-60 dungeons I believe so they can just farm it out while leveling.
---
Even if they didn't know the specific stats, they still 100% knew what to expect. It's not like they went in blind. They knew the strategy and how to gear up for the fight. All they had to do was adjust slightly, if that. 
---
There wasn't going to be any kind of curveball for experienced players. Hell you can still find videos on youtube of an original Ragnaros kill from 2005, so people who didn't fight it back then could have watched those to get a good idea.
---
Exaxtly What I promissed.

You were right! He didn't die in three days. [LOL he died in five!](https://clips.twitch.tv/FineTenderTermiteMau5)
---
Yes! Going through duskwood and I feel like the undead shouldn't just be able to resist an exorcism but alright
---
When wow came out it was laughed at by people who thought it was too easy. It was easy for the games at that time. But it was able to keep people engaged. It had a quick fix while making you feel accomplished.    Now it's all quick fix.  I don't want to go back, I just want them to fix the game. They don't realize what they have done. And I think the people who did left the game.
---
All it takes is a BRD run.  Probably 55.
---
Because the regular subreddit removes all memes
---
The act of exploiting is using a mechanic that exists in a unintended way to gain an advantage. It's literally the definition of it. Blizzard stopped caring a while ago though, and since its used in retail they'll let it slide in classic. If enough people use it they just sort of ignore it.
---
Or, you know, people making fun of those people. So the exact opposite of what you said.
---
Kek
---
Well, they had 25 60's and the rest 56-59.
---
oof
---
Loads of their raid died, did you even watch the VOD?
---
LOL So delusional.
---
Stoked to get a stun! Level 20 gnome rogue here :)
---
Not a lock but I certainly wont have 1000 gold before the next phase.
---
Yeah nah.
---
Always be asking yourself "Is it likely that i'm standing on the spawn points if 7 mobs that are all about to respawn simultaneously?"
---
That's literally the entire thread over on r/wow. Got myself a nice 1 day ban for making fun of them.
---
Sounds like you need to be a rogue. Just sit there and decide someone's fate, does he die to an ambush or the mob, or a friendly wave and now he's off guard so he'll get brave and start sitting down on the floor and eating, for the juicy 100% ambush crit.  
---
Got a bit lost in thought there.
---
Happy for you :)
---
You can get into BRD way before then, like 40 or so. But the MC portal should require 50.
---
"It's just not possible in classic to pull 8+ mobs while questing and not die."
---
The outside world or the pve content?
---
Classic isn't as hard as you make it out to be unless you've got a really weird definition of hard.
---
Classic is full of gotchas and just poor balance, and very little difficulty in the sense of anything that tests your skills as a player.
---
All the early dungeons are super easy, as are most later dungeons. However eventually you get some trick mechanics sprinkled in here and there, which don't have decent conveyance but will kill you if you don't know the trick. Then when you do, it's not challenging to get past once again.
---
The majority of all overworld content is very easy, however a couple specific classes are extremely weak while leveling due to the very poor class balance in vanilla. Any difficulty that does show up typically comes by way of particular mobs that are massively stronger than normal content with no indication of it, or because you didn't use an efficient guided leveling route, pitting yourself against much higher level mobs, which turns them into bullet sponges.
---
It really drove home to me how much of vanilla's difficulty was overhyped when I first hit WC. That dungeon is just a joke if you aren't a clueless kid. Got through the whole thing with no wipes, no challenging pulls, very quickly, and with everyone keeping pretty tight on the dps meter, and while falling asleep in my chair from boredom.
---
The easiest content in classic is just rolling your face across the keyboard easy.
---
Barely anybody in that raid was 60 actually.
---
And people are like "X ClASs Is NoT vIaBlE fOr RaIdS"
---
Yeah that’s why it’s great, it was tailored specifically for Asmon
---
&gt; You have the vendor price addon installed and the addon is telling you, using the glow, that the item is the least valuable grey in your bags and you can destroy it if you need room and are away from a vendor. You can press control to make it appear again.
---
thanks. told my friend this.
---
I know it’s a rhetorical question, but I’m not sure I could beat I Wanna Be the Guy if you gave me 14 years. Maybe I could. But probably not.
---
LUL
---
Only 40 or so guilds cleared naxx before BC .... the whole world cleared MC. I still think it will be cleared in one reset but let’s not pretend naxx 40 wasn’t much more complicated than MC
---
MN said they wernt even trying to for WF 60 because they needed to get the whole guild leveled for WF rag
---
Personally, I like that codex has the drop % for quest items shown on an enemies tooltip
---
I only doubt about one thing and got proven wrong : that there would be people able to spend this amount of time, facing potential health problems, to get heir ass up to level 55+ and do a ragnaros run. 
---
Congratulation to them for the performance.
---
Dude! All the fucking time 3.5 seconds holy fire cast (Priest)  \*RESISTED\* WTF!
---
The vast majority of the playerbase demanded vanilla unchanged, and I have been assured frequently that nostalgia has nothing to do with that. 
---
Now I keep seeing people talking about the "experience," which to me is basically a euphemism for nostalgia. 
---
The amount of things that would have to change to recreate the "experience" is extensive enough that they might as well redo the entire game. You can't unlearn everything you've picked up over the years.
---
Forgive me, master, for making a general statement when an exception exists.
---
Idk, you don't get a world first every day, or maybe they didn't knew ?
---
Wasn't changed until BC.
---
Lvl 13
---
1.12 MC is easy. What made mc hard back in the day was the tuning of items, bosses, and talents, which were pretty fuckin random at times. Oh and lots of bugs and lag..
---
I’m watching one of them stream, and it seems like the biggest challenge is staying awake long enough to complete the attunement quests.
---
Nice! 😊
---
I thought about streaming and playing at 4:3 for the nostalgia as well.
---
Just best the 5 hour queue boss for herod. Level 15 warlock checking in
---
An opportunity was missed sadly.
---
Level 8 Kappa
---
Whats wrong with stacking int as Holy? Or do you at the cost of +heal? Although I don't think you can mess a lot up with trading the 2-3 slots where its possible to choose between heal and int.
---
what addon are you using to put the debuffs on the nameplates? Does it work on mobs you don't have targeted?
---
Thats pretty much the summery of every private server world/global chat when someone mentions that retail endgame is actually much harder than classic content. Seems like a bounch of boomer dad gamers with the "back in my day it was harder and we didnt have addons" attitude that im so fucking tired of.
---
I dont play retail but at least i can respect the main method raid team for playing the game 15 hours a day for months to get world first instead of going on their every world first kill video and saying something in the lines of: bfa easy vanilla hard
---
Is there any feedback on successfully entering the command?
---
You don't think most of them have jobs because they killed Ragnaros in 5-6 days? (A timeframe that fits easily into a week of vacation time from work). Interesting, tell me more.
---
yeah, in the friends app click on your name and select "appear offline".
---
Na. Still need tanks with the cold resist.
---
Right there with you man. I'm so satisfied
---
It's 15 year old content and they are from private servers. There can't be much joy to be had anymore from it. It was likely routine for them.
---
ChatLinkIcons Classic is what I saw someone say
---
The only reason I have skills in the first place is by selling stuff on the auction house for much more than what quests would give me.
---
they already said that the phases will release at different times for EU and NA just like how to works with resets in retail
---
Yep, Wand Spec and Spirit Tap will probably be your best friends. Even if you are going Holy leveling for some asinine reason (you should probably just do shadow) I think those two talents are worthwhile for every priest. Honestly I think wand spec seems great for even raiding because you can add some nice free damage for your group but I'm not even close to 60 so I dont really know what groups want from priests in a raid.
---
Nice job apes!  I am not shocked that Rag would be downed so quickly.  When WoW tried to do a progression server BWL was cleared in greens.  In EQ top progression racing guilds will min/max everything to leveling groups and classes to be the first.
---
You game me a mini heart attack saying it was fathers day
---
Lmao, delusional vanilla fanboy. The raids were blatantly easy back then. Just realize it.
---
I chose Fairbanks because it sounded unappealing
---
Warlock is 100% accurate. And so is Warrior I am learning.
---
leveling experience
---
- Classic : 100~150 hours of carefully picking off mobs 1 by 1 and desperately trying to survive by the skin of your teeth if you pull 2 or 3, then finding a safe place to drink/eat to full without being ambushed at low health/mana.
---
- Retail: 100-~150 hours of instantly one-shotting 5 mobs at a time.
---
Quest design:
---
- Classic: "Collect 10 bear asses from that cave way the fuck over that wayish. I can't remember the exact location but I do remember they hurt like a bitch and are clustered real tight together."
---
- Retail : "Jump in this giant death robot and mindlessly spam 1 until you've collected 10 bear asses"
---
Dungeons (low level):
---
- Classic: Make sure to CC as much as possible, try not to draw aggro from the tank, and make sure your healer's mana is topped off---then keep an eye out for that random patrol, otherwise you're probably dead.
---
- Retail: "I AM FRODO SAGBAG! 11111111111111111111111111!
---
Dungeons (high level): 
---
- Retail: Is this mythic+10? No? Okay let's just pull this entire room, CC it, burst it down before the CC ends, and hit up the boss.
---
Loot (Low level):
---
- Classic: "Oh my god this grey/white/green is such a massive upgrade over my old piece, I'm so glad I found it"
---
- Retail: Eugh, 10th weapon/chest/pants/cape/helm/ring/trinket/shoulder in a row, literally fucking worthless. 
---
Loot (high level)
---
- Classic: Oh I hope the boss drops that sweet weapon I've run 30 times for! YES! IT'S SUCH A MASSIVE UPGRADE I LOVE IT!
---
- Retail: *yawn*, man, this AI is taking forever to finish this warfront. All I want is that damned guaranteed heroic-raid gear----Aaaaaaw fuck it doesn't have a socket, into the trash it goes.
---
Raids:
---
- Classic: Okay, we've practiced the strat, we have a diverse selection of classes, we'll have it done no problem.
---
- Retail: Okay, we've watched fatboss, stacked the four meta classes, aaaaaand the soak mechanic spawned on the other side of the room and we're all dead because RNG. Wipe it up, let's try again.
---
&gt;You muse be lunatic.
---
No, just realistic.

This. Intentional change from the 1.12 state of the game.

I’d have to guess 30-50 times.

Never ending random world quests that don’t even require a group to complete and are just filler content. Queues for raids and dungeons don’t even involved knowing where the instance is located. You hit a button, the computer groups you with 4-20 other people that would never see again, you complete the dungeon and part ways. The loot system sucks, there is no rolling or trading, the piece goes directly into someone’s bag and it is all personalized. Stats have been dumbed down. Gear has been dumbed down. Content has been dumbed down. There is no resistance stats on gear any longer. That’s just part of it. Gold is so meaningless that there are mounts which cost 5 million gold, the economy has gone to hell. Professions are semi worthless and you won’t use any of the gear from a profession as soon as you reach max level. Half the content is hidden behind some daily gated rep farm. I could go on.
---
asmongold is barely 30 and his hairline is receding. Also he is very insecure about it trying to hide it with combovers
---
Meh, this is my reaction.
---
Nice of you to help them promote their site. They give you a free gold for that?
---
I remember being a ret paladin in Wrath and was pretty good but from my memory I don't think it was that great in original WoW. Maybe this is just my desire to want to play 4 different classes.
---
0 and 0
---
Only because I'm waiting on my new laptop to be delivered.
---
How’d they do this with a Ret Pally?!
---
What lvl were they?

Theres also Grobbulus (RPPVP) That's where my horde is because I think bb is ally dominated.
---
16 out of 40 weren't. Your math could be shit, but I assume you're just pulling info out of your ass 😂
---
I think I was 58 my first time in MC
---
Also said if someone from their guild had even tried then jokerd wouldn’t have won
---
1) Dungeon Cleave
---
2) Don't sleep nearly at all
---
3) They've been server first 60s and server first R14's on multiple fresh private servers for years, so PRACTICE
---
4) Most don't have jobs or got a chunk of time off
---
Try Fear first. It's a 100% guarantee the Feared mob will run into a nearby large pack, aggroing all of them.
---
Most of this is just plain falsehood circlejerking. Both have their ups and downs, don't act like classic is infallible.
---
As a warlock I approve.
---
10 man could easily be done with naxx itemization imo.
---
I hate to break it to you...

The level of salt directed at Method was amazing. They are boring but why do people love to hate them so much?

Oh you mean [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]? Because I thought we were talking about [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
---
Wow. Just wow.
---
Is general chat not across layers like trade chat is?
---
I get it. It’s not an axe. It’s a mace, I was excited and wanted to share. Have no idea how to screen shot on a Mac. It’s a borrowed laptop while I am gaming at a mates.
---
Yep it works now, several hours later.
---
Well.
---
That was quick.
---
I just hit 10.
---
Wouldnt call them Classiest. People avoid which ever server then are on generally.
---
It workes for nodes. Got a guy in my guild asking for invite constantly because he's farming nodes
---
The ultimate piss take is when Overpower misses.
---
They stand on the shoulders of giants, i don’t know why people have to belittle the early raiders who developed our understanding of the fundamental mechanics of the game. Its not like everyone who played the first year was a moron. 
---
I think that is the confusion in the discussion of these things.
---
By todays standards of course vanilla raids will be easy, that doesnt mean early vanilla players were “really bad” at what they were doing
---
What is it about Chuck Norris? I’m a newbie, and I’ve heard him talked about on like 3 different occasions in general chat.
---
Priests are one of the easiest classds to level. Lol.
---
How is playing the game exploiting the system ? Is it against TOS right now to log into the game ? And to keep playing it without disconnecting every so often even though you paid for a whole month of game time ?
---
He makes 7 figures idiot noob
---
This is what happens when you don't ASK for a trade first. Don't just open trade windows without asking first. If you don't understand social protocol, quit the game.
---
Stick it in the bank for a few months and you can probably sell it for 1k
---
World first downed Rag in classic. World first was back 15 years ago
---
\*Laughs in level 35\*
---
My anecdotal observations suggest the opposite, but yours probably support yours, so, eh.
---
Probably don't even need to keep it that long. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to go back to a lower level zone in order to level up skinning, well that's a perfect time to abandon it. Or if you are moving out of a zone lots of animals (Stranglethorn Vale) to an area without animals (Plaguelands) then that's another good time to abandon it. Until then, collect up schematics from vendors you meet and mail them to an alt.
---
Oh boy thanks for the link
---
I think my argument would be more that WoW has a power to bring people who don't normally play MMOs, or at least haven't in a long time. These people will probably be gone in a few months. May as well let them enjoy it, things will calm down a bit, then we can look at the game. 
---
You know that this isn't a typical MMO launch. Right now not many people want to talk about the game, it's more about the community. People are out there on the streets hustling for copper, lining up for pics by the streamers, celebrating world firsts. Most of it is just silly fun.
---
It might just be you, yes. Haven't you ever been excited for something and have someone make you less excited? Rather than being the guy bringing people down, it can be fun to instead focus on the enjoyment other people are getting from something you enjoy as well, even knowing that there are flaws that they do not yet see.
---
No one cares.

The reason the goggles dont actually show your eyes is because they're filled with tears.

Sticks &amp; Stones was baiting the outrage culture so hard that they completely failed to see the irony in getting outraged over it.
---
I'm not denying them world first but its undeniably easy so all the people flocking in here to say "gotcha" look pretty silly.
---
a sore loser*
---
Well retail raids are harder than classic raids, there's a difference in difficulty for u
---
They probably got in on launch day and leveled so they don’t want to restart
---
Doesn't dismiss pet have a pretty long cast time?
---
They were the underdogs who just became big time. It's exciting for them.
---
I don't have time to answer all of your questions.  Just ask one maybe that you really want the answer to.
---
Suck the extra 5$ to get 20$ and buy a battle.net card from a Walmart. Boom back in business!

You're doing what is known as 'projecting'.
---
Upvoted for hat eating visibility
---
Damn. Classic is so hard.
---
 You’ll have 30 minutes before being logged out to character select and another 30 before being disconnected.
---
Let's forgive them because it happened in Burning Legion. The best version of WoW.
---
Ret paladins are the same way my man. Only difference is we litteraly rely on auto attacks for our damage. We dont have combo points or finishers or anything when 2 or 3 autos miss in a row. Kind of just sit there and look retarded while seal of command misses or dodges. Rogues got it pretty good.
---
I agree... I think they would clear any raid "within hours of release" if a skilled group of people had been practicing it for YEARS. that's my point, it doesn't matter if you think its "harder". The raids weren't meant to take years to perfect.
---
This guy broke it down pretty well I think: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi-7oKvOM4c
---
You want the first build he talks about, starting around 14:10. But the whole video is really good too.
---
TL;DW is don’t bother w imp blizz or permafrost unless you plan to aoe farm. Go imp nova and frostbite first, then shatter and ice shards together bc of their synergy. Then arctic reach, cold snap/barrier if you want, or go straight into arcane for Clearcasting. 
---
What I found interesting is he doesn’t recommend the flat frost increase talent or WC while leveling. He might explain why but I forgot and can’t listen to it now. But I imagine 2% dmg per point isn’t *that* good of an investment.
---
Twitch chat likes to point out when any streamer is balding and Asmongold has tried to do combovers/etc. for it.
---
Which pet is that? Actually both?
---
I think all these people missed you said you tanked as holy lol, you can totally do that. I remember slapping on a shield and fury tanking zf back in the day
---
Great, so you're only half way there to half the players in the raid in the clip. Half the raid wasnt even 60 haha
---
Yup it's something I wanted myself. Especially since the game was starting at 1.12
---
Nazis dont sing along to Springtime for Hitler. MAGA supporters usually dont wear hats mocking their own ideology.

was he the hardest boss in classic? or is that c thun?

same for my friend. No idea what's going on; it's bugged somehow. let me know if you find a fix
---
Don't be dense. You sure as hell know what I'm talking about.

Can someone explain how can someone play 80 hrs in 4 days?

No, it wasn't.

I will literally eat my hat if Jokerd doesn't solo MC before Method clears it.
---
Of course it is. I don't think anyone reasonable is trying to argue otherwise. But everything in retail that can be accessed with random matchmaking (lfr, leveling dungeons, heroics) and everything that's accessible in the overworld (mostly questing) is completely trivial. In classic, that stuff is at the very least non-trivial, and some of it is legitimately challenging.
---
Probably not a good idea to call people on tinder bro, just reeks of Alabama
---
i did deadmines today for the first time in classic... and i was challenged... i'll just leave it that.
---
Blammo
---
Finally, another person that knows his shit. Same here. Jesus, we were utter shitters back then. I found some old pictures on an old HDD, I had the typical healer UI. Holy shit. How did I even see stuff.
---
jokerd seriously competed with a grand total of one participant and dabbed on everyone
---
This makes me wonder if they patched out the Corrupted Blood epidemic...
---
I wish they would give us pre-nerf C'thun. Would be fun to see if it was really mathematically impossible like people said.
---
Doesn't really matter what your job is, doing one thing for 10 years can be tedious.
---
200iq !!
---
I’m 16. And 12. And 8. I need to get my shit together and focus on leveling 1.
---
Lol
---
You didn't think to google this? The answer is 10 days.
---
Yea ill stick with retail, I don’t appreciate a game that forces me to be good at it so I don’t die every 3 minutes
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Rest
---
6 hours a night isn't bad. It just means you can't do anything other than play wow
---
what are you even talking about? the world first race for jaina, azshara, and pretty much every mythic boss in the last 2 expansions has lasted a full reset. 
---
you're not very bright.
---
I was on k3. Not sure if their was a difference.
---
Even better some people dont have addons telling them vendor price and seem to be putting up items for below vendor price...
---
You cant kill me if I'm ice blocked!
---
You don't have queue times if you log on at 8 am every day and play for 14 hours straight.
---
Said literally no one?
---
Everyone knew hardcore guilds will kill rag in 2nd week. They just didn't think it will happen in 5 days. Especially with way servers are and queue time. 7 days was ideal. 5 days is just amazing.
---
Have you seen BFAs lore?
---
You realize zack and asmongold are different people right? He's really smart about creating chat interaction. 
---
He acts self conscious and guess what. People literally pay him money just to have "bald" appear in the screen.
---
BB really is amazing. Even barrens chat isn't TOO bad lol
---
Your character is still in the game when you do that. It doesn't magically make them disappear. They just stop moving and start the logging out process.
---
It's 30
---
whats the mechanic of ragnaros?
---
Nothing they do will create the same feeling.  Nostalgia can only so so much.
---
Considering all the lf tank spam you should be golden, guessing a lot of warriors aren’t going to pick up a sword and shield
---
There should be plenty of people in general chat needing the quest.
---
Well then in that case you could still turn it on and hope for the best. Best case it is ready sooner, worst case it changes nothing.
---
This is incredibly helpful and makes perfect sense - thank you so much!!!
---
i doubted them
---
Many private servers are harder than actual classic
---
[They didn't have it, and many of them weren't even 60 yet.](https://clips.twitch.tv/FineTenderTermiteMau5)
---
yet the easiest content on both are mind numbingly boring, just classic takes longer to kill things and you can add watching netflix in your rotation. 
---
so i dont really understand the argument here from vanilla to retail.
---
Big brain right there.
---
Don’t go for high level mobs, ambushing green or same level mobs is much more fun, can 1 hit sometimes
---
Kee in mind layering can allow for faster leveling, and these people are certainly not average at all.
---
That's not what the guy from the APES guild who was streaming the Rag kill said lol. He said it was much harder on private servers actually.
---
I mean these guys have been running MC for like 5+ years on private servers.
---
They could probably do the first blindfolded MC clear as well.
---
Yeah I know, I'm just memeing :)

3 minute intros, weird editing with random zooms and slowmo, and Bodies by Drowning Pool playing in the background.

You can spam yours.
---
My worst q has been twenty minutes on a Friday night on a full-high server.
---
I don’t think it matters.. we’re all experienced raiders and the content was hard cause we sucked
---
Yeah I usually do and sometimes it logs me in before I can get home and I get DC’d at the login screen. It’s hit and miss unfortunately.
---
What level do mages then gain back the upper hand after?
---
I plan to make a short guide of locations for Alliance players to grind with level brackets etc. Each one of my locations is close to a vendor, and usually has a chest spawn or two. 
---
I'll compile a shortlist for you before I go to bed in a few hours from this reply.
---
You're somewhat wrong there. The Leroy Jenkins video caused a lot of terrible players to join, making dungeon runs a nightmare each time they wanted to "reinact" what Leroy did. Serenity Now attracted quite a lot of terrible players for rp servers after they crashed the funeral and then South Park brought even more horrible players after their wow episode aired.
---
Vanilla wow have quite their fair share of "retard" communities with celeb guilds existing. It was just more insular to specific servers unless a video went viral.
---
One of the biggest celeb guilds that I had heard of was The Syndicate, and that was partially due to their massive irl events they'd hold for their guild members.
---
Do ppl actually like asmon?
---
I'm sorry, who are you?
---
I've been using it since launch thats it's all it dose
---
Gnomed
---
No?
---
Well we're talking about class design and you're proudly describing things that can't be used in the game's endgame... It's pretty dishonest
---
&gt;skyzone
---
What's he gonna do there, play Dragostea Din Tei?
---
&gt; Retail: Is this mythic+10?
---
Bro, a +10 is low level content, not high level content. 
---
 &gt; Retail: Okay, we've watched fatboss, stacked the four meta classes, aaaaaand the soak mechanic spawned on the other side of the room and we're all dead because RNG. Wipe it up, let's try again.
---
If you're doing the content after a fatboss guide exists, you have no right to call it fucking easy lmao. It's probably been nerfed by that time too.
---
You're right that leveling is more difficult in classic, but max level content is far more difficult in retail.
---
&gt; You make it sound like he cheated
---
Compared to vanilla wow, yeah it's kind of cheating. The record time doesn't really mean much if it's done exploiting. That doesn't mean I'm not impressed, nor do do I think it undermines the race to 60 in real time.
---
More mana more uptime
---
I didn't. I negotiated a 13 year peace until these sons of bitches destroyed it.

---
This has to be some sock puppeting or trolling.
---
And it wasn't Method.
---
again.
---
so... can someone explain to a non WoW guy what just happened?
---
Before I saw the gold counter, I tried to see the “loss” created from the things in the bag
---
Pretty sure for a while you could be banned for doing this by blizzard, somewhere between vanilla and wrath iirc
---
Very well! Got 4 or 5 new pieces of gear during the run and had an absolute blast. I’m so in love with this game right now lmao.
---
Plan ahead
---
This is an argument I just don't get. You can kill everything in LFR and say everything's easy or you can actually challenge yourself and put in the time to do it in Mythic. That's what retail is, play at whatever difficulty you'd like.
---
Especially when you see this world first Rag kill and start to associate classic raids in LFR tier of difficulty.
---
[Turns out many of them weren't even 60 yet LOL](https://clips.twitch.tv/FineTenderTermiteMau5)
---
Crazy
---
Wait for reset? Rag is already dead dude, but yeah, they Will clear him again next reset.
---
Pretty sure he’s thinking they meant one shot as in entire boss hp pool in one hit, which was obviously not what was meant because he said yeah they killed on the first try. I mean obviously they didn’t hit the boss for its entire hp pool.
---
Lonely people that attach themselves to internet personalities so they can feel like they have friends.
---
Don't lie, that is your ACTUAL monitor.   Lol jk
---
I'd love to see speedrun competitions later down the line. Give them s fresh server with everything open and the first guild to kill all bosses wins.
---
Then they'd just need money the next month... If $15 is tough they have bigger problems to deal with than video games, most likely.
---
Wrong
---
I feel this dude pain , heal a warrior running away with 5% hp , get the aggro , get out alive by an hair , he turn around look at me and run away ... rez a rogue who just die , spawn look at me and continue killing mob , ungrateful rat.
---
Because views? Like they don't even have a raid team of people leveling. Hardly anyone from their retail team is there and the people in the event aren't even all playing on the same faction.
---
Your first comment when you weren't even involved in the conversation was "I don't give a fuck." It contributed absolutely nothing to the conversation so I replied in kind.
---
Umm, it was like that on Vanilla too. Guilds would reroll on new servers and rush the content. It was pretty niche but you had “fastest MC/BWL” clear on new servers back in the day.
---
Ayy I just made an undead lock for the first time
---
I'm one of them, and I was wrong. Good work on their part, I didn't think it was possible. I'll eat crow.
---
First of all thanks for giving a nuanced answer. So far, I've run dm, BFD, SFK and it's more of the same.   
---
Monkeynews who downed Rag with APES says that MC is undertuned. The problem is that it's that little difference in difficulty, the lack of need to CC, that takes the challenge and the fun part out of the equation. Same thing we've been criticizing since WotLK.  
---
On a sidenote, I logged in on Netherwing and the pop seemed stable despite Classic.
---
Noice
---
can anyone confirm if the hunter/priest majordomo quest is in the game in phase 1?  i was sceptical that it would because easiest way to get the other part is kazzak/azuregos and they're not added until phase 2.
---
lol same. No point getting upset just watch someone else.
---
I just hit 15 on my warrior. Enjoying the Darkshore quests. Ain’t know way I am rushing to 60. Classic is def about the journey for me!  Congrats on the WF though! Having so much fun again in WoW
---
The horde are a buncha washed up illegal aliens. 
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE.
---
This is baffling. Loll
---
Did you argue that blizz was making a mistake by not starting at 1.0?
---
[“Not possible”](https://clips.twitch.tv/FineTenderTermiteMau5)
---
&gt; Classic isn't as hard as you make it out to be unless you've got a really weird definition of hard.
---
I think his assessment was pretty good, it's medium difficulty.
---
We need to keep in mind just how good the game's best guilds actually are too. These guys killed Naxx in WotLK on day 3 of the expansion with half the raid not even level capped and most people wearing their Sunwell gear. WotLK Naxx was an easy raid, don't get me wrong here, but my guild still took a month to actually kill KT25. We just suck badly compared to these top folks.
---
I abandoned my first and second characters because of insane queues.  Third server was the charm.
---
I've been staring at a character create screen for a bit now debating if it's worth it to even bother making a non rogue melee character. I don't want to tank... ret and enhance are seen as a big joke and it won't get any better as time goes on.  I want to do level 60 PVE content and I mained a rogue in vanilla... so I'm feeling kinda defeated in terms of playing what I actually want to play.
---
That’s good!  Dungeons can be tons of fun if you have a good group, even if you’ve run them a lot of times before!  Glad you’re enjoying wow!
---
Who cares about server first nef. What I’d like to see is blizzard release a server with all phases unlocked and then from their watch a race to down kelthuzad.
---
A wee bit touchy, are ya? Jeez, imagine being this bothered by a stupid macro spam lol
---
Youre a nut hugger
---
I've spent 27 hours in queue so far :):):):):):):):):):):):)
---
Holy shit Abombanation is still posting, what an age
---
Right but maybe they will have the 15 after their bills, or next month. I have no problem sending out 15 so that they can enjoy the game now and don’t have to just watch yk!
---
They are a guild on retail who goes hard whenever a new raid comes out and they usually always win the mythic (hardest difficulty) world race.
---
Too young to enjoy then lol
---
Nah dude, the people skiing the race thing right now are the guys from the main method raid theme, they already cleared the latest raid so there is no reason not to participate in the event.
---
From my understanding, they knew from the get go that they were competing with people far more experienced in classic than them and stood little chance in actually winning it. Some of the casters have been very vocal from the start about the steam being a celebration of the classic launch rather than an actually serious race. Though, other casters again seemed to be under the impression that the dungeon group exp thing would be enough to turn everything upside down, fat chance really. They are still going against people with 10 years of experience doing the exact same thing. Personally I didn't find the steam particularly exciting, just tuning in occasionally to see if any of the casters I like the most were on for some background noise a when playing the game myself.
---
Act like you’ve been there before. You know?
---
So your a pathetic zoomer who wants to look cool infront of everyone.
---
Fuck off kud u didnt play wow back in the day so dont make up shit jokes
---
I've been living this way since watching this episode in the 90s. 
---
Lok'tar ogar, friends
---
Name of add on?
---
Obviously it's easy when they start the game on the patch where they buffed everyone and nerfed the raids...
---
Pretty sure it was because they realized WoD was doomed fairly early on and diverted resources that normally go to working on the current expansion to developing the next. Hence why Legion has so many unique storylines like class halls.
---
&gt; People are under the impression that mobs in MC are going to fall over to groups of lvl 55-58 players in leveling greens.
---
[And those people were right. Many of them weren't even 60 yet.](https://clips.twitch.tv/FineTenderTermiteMau5)
---
Literally anything other than sitting on my ass playing games. Games are my way of saving money without losing my mind. Throw me an extra grand each month and I would definetely be a completely different guy.
---
You can literally ask in general chat for someone to invite you, or guildies.
---
You will have to press the button. It won’t automatically keep targeting the next enemy without you pushing the button. 
---
Also, if you push the button without having an enemy targeted, I think you will target an enemy automatically. 
---
There is a macro command to target an enemy but I don’t think it’s needed in this case.
---
Classic is still new. People are acclimating to the sudden strange reality that pulling 2 mobs can kill you. You and everybody else are kidding yourselves if you don't think players will realize that you just have to be more careful how you pull and suddenly the game becomes easy.
---
Nah I'm fine, don't worry about it, huge thanks though
---
If you swap between your Specs in your spell book like Shadow to Disc it'll keep you logged in but tag you as AFK. Only need to do it once every 10-15 minutes.

I was just confused because it said first rogue. Nothing about being the first lvl 60 rogue. Being the first lvl 60 rogue seems less impressive. Just means you either took a few weeks off work and don't have a family or you have no life outside of video games. 
---
But what do I know. I just work a bunch and have a family...
---
Mother's maiden name? Skoogles
---
Raiding isn't the only PVE content, nor is it the only endgame PVE content.
---
lol, *dishonest.*
---
What if u put it in this perception. Of the 89 hours that classic was live (at the moment he hit 60), he only slept for 12 hours total during that time.
---
Who would think that 15 years of playing vanilla (remember these guys are a private server guild), practicing doing this over and over and over again would pay off :P
---
This was fantastic, please do more. I need to binge watch lol.
---
Where?
---
Don't have to queue if you never log out.
---
Try levelling as Fire instead?
---
Frost has all the fun PvP and safety talents, but I levelled my Mage fire and I always felt like he blew things apart. Was fun.
---
You either crit multiple times and melt the mob or miss multiple times and have to use evasion to kill one mob
---
Careful, this is dangerously close to implying that the InSaNe difficulty of levelling in vanilla because you can die if you pull more than a couple of mobs at once isn't because you're at your maximum capacity and simply cannot match the sheer apm/mechanical skill/level of big brain require to either 1) press a couple of spells then auto attack mobs to death or 2) press 1/2 buttons until it dies.
---
Vanilla levelling sure may be hard... Because it truly is a slog to reach 60 when it's literally braindead content and you're stuck doing it for a (relatively) extremely long time.
---
My point is that discussing Nazis in this day and age unless we're talking about WW2 would imply the people engaged in the discussion are teenagers. Particularly edgy teenagers, at that
---
Hasn't this game been out for a long time though?
---
Look at mister speed leveler over here. Why don't you slow down and smell the roses
---
My wife and I have had a great time playing Classic together. BC came out shortly before we got married so we have a lot of good memories of playing WoW together, and it's been great to show her the early days of the game again.
---
If my wife did not play WoW...she would be really mad at me right now.
---
I bet you EQ's difficulty comes purely from artificial things like gear gating and that sort of thing. I'm sure if you made a Re-EQ project and Method attacked it, they'd one shot all the stuff in that game.

A decent thing to do would of been to buy it and send it back to him as a cod for what you paid and give him a helpful hint, letting him know his mistake. But I guess I’m just too nice of a person. 🤷‍♂️
---
That's kinda the point. Retail always offers you an easy way out. Leveling taking too long? Just buy a boost. Need some spare change to buy consumables for raid night? Just buy a token (pro tip, you can also use this to buy heirlooms to make leveling even easier)! Don't have the energy to commit to Mythic raiding, or even heroic? Well we have this cool mode where you get to kill all the same bosses but it requires absolutely no effort, you don't even have to be at the keyboard!
---
Obviously that all comes with the caveat that, if you are so inclined, you can seek out some really great and challenging content in retail. But you are *confronted* with challenging content in classic from level 1. This builds a much stronger foundation for an RPG.
---
welp, guess you got lucky because I haven't :( EU servers
---
Makes duh money
---
It's still a world first, it's a world first in classic. No one is trying to say it's the world's first ever kill of rag, ever.
---
“Same game presented differently”. 
---
No, not really.  It’s not “presented” differently, it is different.  
---
There are several dozen mmo’s that have the same classes, questing, gear collection, dungeons, etc. and you wouldn’t call them the same game game presented differently.  They’re different games.  
---
I don’t know about other servers, but no one is being toxic towards retail on bigglesworth.  Every now and then someone comes into chat talking shit about classic and they get told to go back to retail if they don’t like it, at least on horse side of the server.  
---
But I’m calling bullshit on your entire post.  You’re not going back to retail because of classic community, your making shit up.
---
Where is the announcement that pops up saying it is a World or Server first?  I didn't see anything.
---
I would say AQ and Nax is when things started to get  hard.
---
I'm level 13 and just got my first gold yesterday from nothing but questing since launch. I felt so proud. Then again, I'm a pally so it's not like I have any skills to buy.
---
I hit 40 and now I feel like I’m just a casual
---
No queues since day one! Still running into people everywhere doesn't feel low pop at all.
---
I say play whatever you like, I dont think itll be too hard to find groups later on. And I think fury warriors and really good for endgame dps btw.
---
how do you increase the nudity
---
That's the whole point. It's all relative. Nothing in vanilla raids even compares to a mildly complex dungeon boss in retail, and yet even 'average' players by today's standards can manage it. A 'bad' player of today's standards isn't even close to being as bad as 2005's bad.
---
&gt; every raid will be fully one shotted within 2 hours of entering it.
---
Yes.
---
That's what happens when the community has been collectively practicing and refining its strategies for 13 years.
---
It's not at all surprising that guilds who've beaten a raid 356 times together won't struggle on their 357th time.
---
&gt;its amazing you actually spend a decent amount of time typing out all that bullshit. all of your points are truly baffling.
---
Judging by how poorly thought out your above statement is, it's probably because you spend more time talking than thinking.
---
What server?
---
They push that button while **not** standing in the fire. Really expert strats you see
---
The items are largely irrelevant the big changes from original rag kill to 1.12 patch were in the core classes and talents themselves.  The classes are FAR stronger in 1.12's classic than in 1.4's original rag kill in OG vanilla.  The boss was still super easy compared to retail raids but killing rag in 1.12 versus 1.4 is a damned joke of a comparison.
---
I'm level 35
---
This isn't an accurate representation of a "normal" raid. This group has obviously played A LOT together and everyone knows exactly what to do and when to do it. Please do not watch this and think this will be your average raiding experience.
---
Rogues are honestly almost as bad as Warriors until about lv20-30ish.
---
That's when you start getting the real "Rogue" abilities and things start to really feel like they're going your way. Mobs get a lot easier to solo, you're (comparatively) a lot more powerful and if things go wrong, you've got answers.
---
&gt; if you plan on tanking and have points in seal of righteousness theres no reason to go in the retribution tree
---
There is a reason. That reason is Deflection= (1% parry per point.) Which if consecration is taken then the max the pally can take is 4/5 in deflection. It is a brutal choice. It is in such a bad spot. It is a very solid reason to go up that far.
---
Seal of command though, no. Not possible. Bad idea for many reasons even if it was possible.
---
‎¿qué?
---
This makes me so nervous, just asking to hit the escape key
---
If you don't find Mythic raids challenging in retail there is nothing for you in Classic either. Classic raids are a joke by comparison.
---
Holy SHIT the warrior is accurate lmfao! It's hard enough without the dynamic respawns hahahah
---
It was literally impossible. The main guild did out the math as if 40 bis players were playing perfectly.
---
That's what I was wondering, the attunement is looooong.
---
I haven't seen render distance anywhere
---
Warlock's fault for not using immolate first.
---
yea man they killed it so fast because they hve been practising this raid for 15 years!! on private servers lmao. what will be your next argument when many other guilds and pugs who never played a pserver just walk into it and 1 shot every boss b4 reset?
---
on heroic? fuck yes he was super difficult
---
As someone said earlier... Most of us at the time were forced to count on less than 10 people to carry the 30 other ones... I remember that my guild spend way too much time on Geddon that I though was possible for people with a connected brain.
---
I always love when default voice responses completely betray an NPC's character

Yeah but no one will take you unless you can link achievement and have over 9000GS.

We don't get queues because we rerolled to a new lower population server after launch
---
I'm guessing you've never actually seen the clip or have serious autism and cant detect sarcasm?
---
Yeet
---
Just as an addendum, that miss penalty is only for white damage.
---
Any abilities (yellow damage) have a 5% base miss chance. So your sinister strikes and eviscerates will be unaffected.
---
Honest questions not trying to be rude do these people have jobs? Between working, doing normal social things, significant other I’m up to like an hour or two a day. What careers do these guys/gals have that allow them to play that much, I want that!
---
It was perfect.
---
a stick
---
I think the same but maybe it’s seen as overly aggressive ?
---
Being generous, what I just saw was a Normal difficulty speed run. I don't see how any Heroic guild doesn't clear with ease and any Mythic guild doesnt one shot. Provided they get the logistics down.
---
I don't like WOW, just it ... you understand? or want transform my unlike to other bad things?
---
Just earlier in stone talon mountains. I, warrior 25, wave to a hunter (23) and keep running. All seems good for 2 seconds. Then hunter marks me. I charged his ass while I still could and hamstrung him. 4 swings and he was dead. Guess he didn't level in dungeons since level 18, as he was quite squishy. The easy hunter life made him soft. I ENDURED A TRIAL OF PAIN LEVELING AS A WARRIOR!
---
Felt very satisfying to get the jump on someone trying to screw me. My first fight with horde, too.
---
46 here. Don't worry about it, enjoy the game. As for me, I took some time off so I could enjoy the game. 17 hours a day. Since launch.
---
Naxx attunement is literally just buying it lol.
---
TBF though the day 1 naxx kill will have the optimal 8 tank raid comp for that fight using all optimal buffs/elixers/potions with all resistance gears ready ahead of time.
---
I mean a the time, it was insane.  Guilds were destroyed by classic raid content.  Trying to get 40 people together for a raid and get them on the same page was a chore itself.
---
But while the game from a technical standpoint is exactly the same, there is no way to recreate everybody being clueless nubs with no raid experience or vast amounts of knowledge resources to turn to.
---
I know man I'm just making Jokes it's all in good fun
---
I was a vanilla hordey, wanted to see the story from alliance this time round. I’ll take your HAppy Farthers Day, as I’m teaching my kids to farm my fishing up today whilst I have a nap
---
How?! Wtf. It took ages to down Ragnaros in vanilla. There’s already enough geared 60s to down Ragnaros like 4 days after it came out?!
---
It's also a good way to manage Feared targets because you can quickly slap it on your Feared target if it's getting too close to another pack.
---
Requires xp. Mob totems do not proc buff. Tested yesterday.
---
yeah. my old GM thought you needed all that AND the 4 piece t3 on all 8 tanks to even have a chance.
---
yeah, and you just layer hop away
---
Gee I am so glad they will "save time later".
---
You are acting like WoW is a job - not a game.
---
Meanwhile half of classic is just aoe grinding SM and ZF to get to endgame. Turns out the problem wasn't blizzard, it was the players.
---
Are all the raids accessible right now? They could just keep going to zg, aq20, bwl?
---
People will parrot things that hear from vanilla players without understanding context. Vanilla was hard not because the raids were hard, but because everything was such a time investment and nothing was just handed to you. Mechanically, its super simple.
---
They aren't.
---
Leveling with skinning and making sure you look everything, plus only taking useful abilities from a trainer, I have around 7 gold and I’m level 27. Skinning is the best for early money, regardless of class
---
Already did. I got my rogue to 14. I went ahead and was doing 14 dps with 2 green swords on same level mobs. I made a shaman and I was doing that dps at lv 6. In lv 12 now and my dps is 30 on shaman.
---
I didn't say they can't do it their way. Just that they will run out of things to do much faster than normal players.
---
Not a difficult concept for most of us.
---
same.. smooth so far, just dinged 30
---
They are pretty much the only viable tank for a long time so you’ll be fine
---
Got resisted 5 times in a row once on my mage. And one time I accidentally pulled an extra mob so that the two of them staggered their attacks just enough so I practically couldn't get a cast of. Dinged 10 on the way there so I hadn't gotten around to but Frost nova yet.
---
Mating call.
---
It’s technically not a world first. It was done 15 years ago.
---
I feel like sticking Tyrannical/Fortified on every week's stones was a really negative change. Just always either having bosses be harder or trash be harder no matter the difficulty was a really obnoxious change. Obviously, it was present on the +10s and up in Legion, but it honestly made me not want to do M+ at all in BfA because it just always seemed so obnoxious to deal with.
---
Go markmanship aimed shot is awesome
---
He doesn't do shadow damage anymore, just so you know.
---
Also, where are you from ?
---
Because the pings were not always great but the connections were already really stable in US/Western Europe.
---
But I have to admit a lot more people were struggling to have decent fps in crowded situations than nowadays.
---
Man I was on your side
---
Yeah having mages aoe farming the most efficient spots on every layer definitely helped.
---
is this US only ? doesn't seem to work for me on a EU server, i get blank inventory on caracter creation
---
To be *faaaaaaaaaiiiiiiirrrrr*
---
I reckon it will help when Phase 2 comes (well when Honor system comes into play).
---
But there will probably be a big gap for these guys inbetween phases.
---
What is the “layer” exploit I keep hearing about?
---
I guarantee you these guys have some cheeky strats they're working on to get through it without multiple Dreadnought set bonuses.
---
Remember: there was no such thing as beta testing Vanilla raids, so no one knew about the 4H mechanics until they encountered it finally for themselves and started to realize that Taunt resists were gating this thing.
---
Players are so much better know, they know every boss mechanic in Naxx inside and out, they know every gear combination and sneaky little set of class talent interactions...I'm 100% sure they will kill Naxx on day 1 and overcome the 4H gate with clever planning. All of the DPS checks in Classic are going to be hilariously easy, and the Warrior population is so skewed since everyone knows how OP that class is. I bet they'll just waltz through Naxx with 2 main tanks, 10 DPS Warriors in the raid who can all attempt Taunts on 4H in case of resists, and maybe even a Feral Druid or two who can Bear Form since people have figured out how to competitively DPS in Cat Form now by abusing Wolfshead Helm and Manual Crowd Pummeler.
---
im becoming very suspicious that it isnt even possible to mine or farm anything inside of an instance, because when im not in a grp i cant even see any nodes in vicinity while probing around
---
try opening task manager while playing and keep firefox open listening to music. see what your usages are and what occurs when the freeze happens? if anything spikes to 100% it can be a bottleneck. if anything goes under 30% usage it can be a over heating problem . hope this helps
---
I cant fucking wait man. WOTLK will be the only time i play hardcore
---
We're all sure that some APES member didnt lvl to 60 before him and just didn't care to post it as he did it 100 times recently on Pservers?
---
Jokerd has been a nobody for years, only getting recognition because he was first place. He didn't have fan boys from the start, he earned them because he worked for it.
---
I was about to hit level 19 and my internet died and I dont have time for a 4 hour queue...
---
It just kinda shows what they meant with 'you think you do, but you don't'.   
---
First few days are honeymoon as people are sitting in Barrens having fun. Then dungeon cleaving happens and you see half the server doing this to level up fast neglecting the questing aspect of vanilla. Dude getting to 60 with 3 days played was another hit for Classic, now MC being cleared by people in greens and half raid not being 60 is another hit cos all this gearing for first raid lost meaning. So pretty much what happens is mindless dungeon grinding till 60, then going straight to MC and you are done with p1.   
---
With p2 people will notice how ass PvP is without resilience and how boring having only BG is.   
---
I am playing the game myself, was hoping to clear all the content as I didn't do any end game content back in vanilla days, but I don't know anymore if I will continue playing as I don't see many people sticking around for so long.

&gt; Me: "Classic raids are easier than modern raids by a significant margin"
---
What are you talking about dude? You never said that. You were basically saying that they were the same difficulty in the way that you compared them, the only difference being that apparently you had to "stack meta classes" (didn't play in BFA but in all patches prior to that, never a thing unless going for like a top 20 finish) and rely on "RNG" (again, never a big factor at all, no idea what you're on about).
---
&gt; Content requires level cap, full epics, and progression through normal dungeons, heroic dungeons, mythic dungeons, and mythic+1~9
---
The point is you were comparing the highest level dungeon in classic to a dungeon in retail that isn't even close to the highest level. An actual high mythic+ key is infinitely more difficult than any vanilla dungeon, that's my point. And even if you want to not count dungeons past the item level cap, they are still infinitely more complex and mechanically challenging than vanilla dungeons that are just "don't pull too much" and tank and spank.

---
You might have to do the occasional bit of off tanking as a dps warrior, but it’s like a couple trash packs and 2 bosses you’ll be off tanking. Struggling to remember BWL, but I’m pretty sure that as a dps warrior there was nothing in BWL that needed ot. Could be wrong though, it was a long time ago.

do you have a link to them? can't find anything on google

What weals are you using? Swords tend to be better than daggers since they are a little slower and have a lower miss chance....Also try to find hit chance in a talent tree somewhere that might help...I’m not very good at rogue either

Did you expect anything different from a boss 15 years ago?
---
I never said that Paladins can't MT raids.  That is the decision of each guild.  That said, if they don't understand crushing blows then they are woefully unprepared.  If they do, then they have accepted the risk and are okay with it.  Paladins are more vulnerable to crushing blows than warriors.  This is a fact.  Whether a raid group is willing to accept that and run with it is not at debate here.
---
A druid can MT MC and they are even more at risk than a paladin.
---
Undergeared and newer raiders will struggle if their tank has a higher risk of crushing blows.
---
Whether you want to argue that a shaman can tank MC, because they theoretically can, doesn't change the fact that the optimal choice is a warrior.
---
People seem to be overestimating MC. Back then it was difficult because no one knew wtf they were doing.
---
We have every info available to us now. They knew what they can get away with at bare minimum and capitalized on it. Simple.
---
Mc was never hard at all. The players were bad.

My feeling is that if you like tanking, you should tank. You might not like it, or you might not be good at it, and you might have no interest in getting better at it. BUT, if you enjoy doing dungeons and stuff as the tank, then you are going to have an easy time getting dungeons and you will have fun.

Spell power didn't even exist in 1.0. Shit was wild.
---
&gt;because that's the reference client they had available
---
I guarantee they have a reference client for every patch ever delivered to retail.
---
From a practical standpoint 1.2 was the point after launch by which they fixed most of the broken shit and implemented the first major round of balance.
---
I'd rather work around a Long Que then deal with no people on the actual server when I do get to play. I want to play with people. Not grind to 60 seeing a handful the entire time.
---
&gt; within hours of them all getting 60
---
3/4th of the raid was 2-3 levels before 60.

As a nilla WoW vet with some hardcore guild experience, this is freakin insane with what I hear is happening on these servers.
---
oh, wow. yeah. blame him for wanting to be presentable infront of an audience of thousands. 
---
also, being insecure about your hair receding is fucking normal wtf. nothing strange, weird about that. 
---
and makes jokes about his hair all the time.
---
Basically, it gives a small number of people who are drastically ahead of the curve free range to farm several servers worth of resources for a few days until the rest of the power levelers catch up.
---
Because this is such a worse problem than having dead servers in two months, day long que times, or being completely unable to tag any mobs at all around the starting areas.
---
How did they all get the douse quest done so fast? Is it because it's on 1.12 they farmed hydraxian rep? Someone explain lol. My guess is they farmed hydraxian did the ubrs quest did the kill 1 mob quest left handed it in. Did the hands qiest left handed it in and came back with 7 douses. I know at revered? You get douse + eternal douse so only a few peiple2needed to technically do it?

They spent the last 5 years telling us that we wouldn't be happy with classic, that it was all rose tinted goggles, that we would hate every second of it---And a lot of them bought into that narrative wholesale.
---
To see us:
---
1. get what we want
---
2. acknowledge its flaws
---
3. Still be genuinely satisfied
---
Has got to be a massive case of cognitive dissonance for a lot of people.
---
Not only do they (naturally and understandably) not want to admit they were wrong in their assumptions, they also have to deal with reconciling their convictions with reality.
---
To add insult to injury, they've moved the goalposts many times over the last few weeks
---
- "Oh they'll all quit when they realize it isn't like they remembered"
---
 - It was exactly as remembered and loved all the same
---
- They only liked it because of the people you played with! it won't be the same because you're all older and have drifted apart!
---
 - Everyone immediately makes new friends ingame and has fun with them.
---
- "Oh they'll all quit when they can't complete mobs because the tagging system is broken"
---
  - Collectively forms lines to ensure the fair distribution of quest objectives
---
- Oh they'll all quit when they get to the barrens and see how garbage it is
---
 - Barrens chat immediately comes back and people have fun with it
---
- "Oh they'll quit when they get to 30 and see how long they have left until 60"
---
 - People hit 30 and continue enjoying it by 40
---
- "Oh they'll quit immediately when they realize they won't be able to afford their mount the moment they hit 40"
---
 - People hit 40 without being able to afford a mount, still having fun while saving up
---
etc etc etc etc
---
They're in too deep, they can't give up now.
---
That's truly amazing.
---
Got my first gold today too!
---
*visits class trainer*
---
Annnnd it's gone
---
Kinda torn from shaman mage and rogue . I want to invest about 4 hours daily so casual gamer. Pvp server so viable for everything pvp and raids but dont care for pushing top numbers. Farming gold also is key since i doubt ill have time for an alt. 
---
Note i am new to wow in general so i am generally unfamilliar with the game but enjoying it alot. Just struggling with the key decision . I have leveled both but since i dont know the endgame i cant make a fair decision
---
I like shaman since it looks like a mage and a warrior but forms say hes support so idk
---
Mage is usually a glass cannon 
---
Also druid looks super fun but every form talks bad on their wpvp outside healing
---
Id my grammar is bad i apologise my internet is down so im on mobile. 
---
Thanks
---
Does classic have heroic / mythic raids? If not could we maybes get them?
---
All hail Gonebald!
---
screen shot and saved
---
Cookie cutter builds are the best if you want to min max but if you want to play something different do it. 
---
The biggest problem with fire is that it sucks in pvp you have nothing to really distance yourself from your opponent and most of your moves have long CDs also molten core and black wing lair have fire resistant bosses so yeah, there’s that.
---
LIAR!

---
 Better not waste that infinitely replenishable mana
---
Love isn't always on time
---
Woah woah woah
---
Wrong trainer. You want the guy in Dolanaar.
---
They've always been that way dude.
---
A good player on a bad class is better than a bad player on a good class.
---
not to mention its totally normal to be insecure about your hairline receding.
---
Only 25 were 60, rest were 56-59. Also only tanks really needed gear.
---
What is Method?
---
He showered literally every day but hey, stinky no-lifers am i right?
---
You don't really need gear for MC with how good players are nowadays. MC was always easy mechanically, but we were almost all awful MMO noobs back when did it 15 years ago
---
I'm not anti-Method. I like Sco and enjoyed his stream for the World Firsts in BFA.
---
Fair enough to express your opinion, but have you listened to what the casters on Method's Twitch are saying?
---
Are they still farming Scarlet Monastery?
---
They had decent gear. They were literally farming BRD for 4+ levels.
---
oof.
---
you know what the hardest part about naxx was? Getting 4 geared tanks. We didnt know back then we need this, now we know.
---
Naxx will be cleared day 1.
---
It's because you are a mac user and don't have a concept of Windows time. ;)
---
It's a normal counter for Windows operations :D
---
This is just my opinion and my point of view. I know not everyone will agree with me. I am happy that someone got WC on Rag. I am happy for them, but considering they are all private server guys who have done this nonstop for the past 15 years...kinda ruined the fun of WC Rag. When they downed it it was like...meh.
---
8.
---
Yup. Although, if they had Tier .5 there is a bit of difference.
---
"why does my FPS tank when I turn my camera this way?"
---
AQ and Naxx are hard, so definitely wont get one shotted. Other ones yeah, probably.
---
I already have 12 characters (8 on Grobbulus, 4 on Deviate Delight) with at least one more on deck. The highest is level 9, and that's only because I want to get my hunter to 10 so I can suicide-run her up Teldrassil to tame pretty and instigate some lowbie PvP shenanigans.
---
I admire these guys' dedication and mastery of the game but holy carp I can't even imagine playing the game like that.
---
Super fun, had some fun back and forth before this final push.
---
More people need to layer their way to 60 so i can start finally getting decent prices on the stuff i put on AH :P
---
can't tell if this is a joke or not
---
Fishing poles from shellfish to AH. Everything else to vendor.  
---
At rock eles I vendor everything else than deeprock salt and elemental earth.  
---
At basilisks I vendor everything except the trinket.
---
Is it really that much different than playing a new iteration of the same game? Especially when you think most of the versions are steadily getting worse.  There's a reason classic is wildly successful right now.  I wrote it off as nostalgia at first, but playing myself, there really is something special in it.
---
It's just the release though, a lot people no life like that for first 2 weeks, highly doubt they are gonna keep going like this for a lot longer.
---
A big part of retail WoW was gimped by people with half the raid AFK and half the players in subpar specs and not knowing what they were doing.
---
You get a full group of players who've played private servers for the last decade optimizing talents, knowing all the fights, and add to that Paladins (who are insanely OP in Classic PvE and PvP) and you're gonna run over everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they clear pretty much everything available that isn't gated by a DPS check the second it's released (e.g., Vael, Patch).
---
Hello my fellow Kirtonos resident!
---
Great server!  Had a ton of players but no waits to get on.  I think it's in the sweet spot of population.
---
I thought they were only layering the starter zones?
---
its not instant tho
---
Ouch
---
Ignore all of these, you should be questing in the Barrens. So many low level quests!
---
I made BFD group 2 days ago and 5 full groups quit on me after seeing I was healing at level 19. I did it the next day at level 24 and barely even had to heal the tank. People are fucking retarded and acting like this game is incredibly difficult.
---
&gt;It's impossible to get Critical Hit Immune
---
This presumption is false. Since you know about the attack table, you most likely understand that having parry+dodge+block over 100% pushes crits off. Warriors get 75% block chance from shield block, which makes them crit immune with some talents and gear.
---
I'm not sure on the exact details on that. Just what it us in general.
---
All those euro kids who have been playing vanilla for 15 years are showing a DEMO
---
Gotta hate on the stinky no-lifers though right, having a hobby they enjoy. 😡
---
My understanding is that people can do multiple douses. And the rep grind for it takes 3-5 hours as a mage in Silithus, and they can do it while leveling
---
How’d they all level so fast on each class? I get the world first being a mage with air grinding but what about the rest? Do they just spam aoe dungeons?
---
Nah.. just spend only on necessities and you can be that rich too. Just sold a ton of greater magic wands and greys.
---
to be fair, they got all the gear they needed before even getting to 60
---
I never complained? I was saying they're not really strict about it
---
I have Clobberknock, Steakandeggs, and Icyhot running around just fine
---
challenge OMEGALUL
---
Good on you! I had to delete my previous lvl 13 due to account changes but I’ve got a rogue almost back up there now, if only I could play it without waiting in a long queue
---
My guild has a guy named Stevebannon. How is Bearokobama worse? At least that’s creative.
---
I don’t know their Progress yet I’m just repeating what I have read. They were the first on private servers for many things and &lt;APES&gt; has some former members I believe. Maybe someone else who stumbles upon this thread can give more insight.

---
Wow this is insane, thanks for the quick reply, I might ignore the respect at 30 and delay it till 41 like you said due to infrequent available time that I'm able to play and probably won't have good gear by then. Again, thanks for the help, really solid build!
---
But addons are 3rd party.
---
From the comments it just seemed like a lot of people are disappointed it was so quick. Like Classic is going to be old news very quickly now. Just the feel I got
---
Boosting with real money always had the risk of getting scammed or losing your account, blizzard being the dealer now makes it more accessible to millions of users      
---
Almost every hc raid in legion i was part of had 1 or 2 people who were severely undergeared and the raidlead tried to hide it       
---
Just open up the game and youre getting blasted on the tradechat by 10 different boosters     
---
Really gives the game a cheap f2p touch
---
Because all of us private server folks have cleared Rag dozens of times. In their case, probably hundreds.
---
That's a 100% you eat a hat.
---
triggered lol
---
Also, there wasn't much competition for world first MC. They didn't win a close race, they won by a mile.
---
I feel like Stalagg, Skeram, and Thalnos will all have really good server health long term. The other big 3 are way too overpopulated, like I'm not even sure if the population drop off will be enough.
---
&gt; Drop a massive expansion that somehow engages the classic population and generates hype and gets everyone back into retail. Keep the classic crowd happy with a small dev team providing updates to keep them engaged.
---
This is the optimal path forward. All classic has done is bought them time and a chance to conduct research into what content players are into, it won't have huge numbers for years.
---
 You're totally agreeing with them lol.
---
You're just acclimated to BFA style and aren't to classic.
---
Honestly once you get used to the fact that you should have relatively high hp before pulling a mob and not try to get 3 at the same time you'll be fine.
---
Priest leveling : Bubble+wand for 12 seconds.
---
Warrior : Charge + hero once or twice.
---
Locks : Send pet, optionally cast a few spells or wand.
---
etc etc
---
There is a VERY simple and good counter : pull slowly and carefully.
---
The only danger of classic atm honestly is patrols and respawns
---
Ret bomb gg
---
M A L D I N G
---
Dude, Method is top because they freaking make the start for bosses and are pro at Mechanics. Your Vanilla race is only about who sleep the less. Even more unhealthy than doing tries on a boss for 12 hours.
---
Most warrior want to play dps. There are only 1-2 main tanks per guild so it is hard to gain the spot, but offtanks/dps hybrid are always in demand. For dungeons, tanks are in hight demand to the point where you will be able to reserve items for running the group.
---
Ok &lt;3
---
Its because this is literally all these people have done for the past decade. Is farm vanilla raid content on private servers. I guarantee you that a normal guild wont be able to down him so quickly. 
---
I mean it isnt a complicated fight by any means, but this is all these players have done for several years now. Its expected that it looks so simple and easy to them. 
---
Be like watching Navy Seals playing airsoft against 12 year old kids and wondering why it looked so easy for the Seals to win the game.....
---
With a capital REEEEEEE
---
Someone wants a handout methinks.
---
Everyone’s hipe that he is world first classic 60, but what about the world first classic Rag kill that just happened?
---
&gt;If you can do something while watching netflix at the same time without complications you aren't being challenged.
---
So, are you trying to prove my point or not?
---
Because I've been watching netflix the whole time levelling in classic so far, while following a big green arrow on the screen from the auto pilot addon so that I don't have to even attempt to read any of the text.
---
Makes it much more bearable than sitting there intently staring at my character auto attack, or sitting down drinking.
---
I could apply the second half of your post to vanilla wow very easily.
---
People act like not running in and pulling everything is hard. And if you DO manage to do that, then apparently running away is really hard? Because thats what you do if you pull too many.
---
if not, you say whatever and eat a few minutes of corpse run. Whatever. 
---
&gt;an error that costs me a corpse run and a repair bill
---
An unlikely event that incurs a penatly of a few minutes and a sum of gold negated by the next white trash item you find. Oh no.
---
Specs don't really matter for the most part, also they are very used to playing on harder tuned servers (pservers tune everything higher so people actually play instead of steamrolling through the content) and even then it's not that hard for people that actively play there.
---
Imagine being this salty at a random comment
---
F
---
I keep forgetting about layering
---
Not even close.
---
&gt;Gnomeland Security
---
Dont dead open inside
---
Well no one was competing for world first vanilla 60... they were competing for world first classic 60. Which has layering, and leeway, and spell batching and a bunch of other shit that didn't exist in vanilla.
---
Any retail guild doing decent probably?
---
Apes are vanilla raiders, probably not top tier Mythic BFA raiders is what EvroRS is implying.
---
[Okay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU16eHEJazo)
---
Macros keep your abilities at the correct level... just use Macros.
---
For real. Right now for me it's mostly just job and school, too. Family is #3 on that list.
---
because that look is his moneymaker
---
Makes me worried it wasn’t harder.
---
K e K I did too
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
You gave no examples and just blamed a whole guild for non guild casters which you still didn't mention what they did.
---
What Is layering?
---
my fav moment in retail was when I hit 120 I killed a lvl 117 alliance member.  5 mins later she brings  her lvl 120 main who had bis gear.  Got owned

&gt;Ok, so just to confirm, Method are hosting a bunch of players, including method guildies, on the method stream, called 'race to world first', but they're definitely not participating
---
They aren't even all playing on the same faction or server.
---
3 figure salary means he makes at the maximum $2.73 per day
---
Did you get the scrolling battle text working?
---
How many people were in the raid?
---
This made zero sense. And very inaccurate.
---
Onyxia took 69 days
---
Molten Core took 154 days 
---
Netharions Lair took 77 days 
---
AQ took 113 days
---
Naxx took 90 days
---
That’s for vanilla now let’s look at Legion and BFA
---
Emerald Nightmare 18 hours (no reset)
---
Trial of Valor 3 days (no reset)
---
Nighthold 11 days
---
Tomb of Sargeras took 3 weeks due to KJ’s tuning which sco mentioned it was tuned like Vanilla bosses 
---
Antorus 8 days 
---
Uldir 8 days
---
BoD 7 days( no reset) 
---
Crucible of Storms 9 days
---
Eternal Palace 10 days
---
So what exactly are you talking about? This is all confirmed on Methods website. So good luck with you’re moronic logic that has no facts at all.
---
What a feisty little champ!
---
Also wondering if there's an Alliance version. I love fishing so if there's something for us that involves fishing that makes good money I'd love to know.
---
Retail babies talking more about classic than playing their own game but I’m “triggered” lmao. I’m super casual, here for the grind to 60 and the PvP grind after that. Getting my money’s worth. Duno why people are acting surprised 15-year-old content is a cakewalk for dedicated players 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I’m getting every class to 10 before I decide on one...
---
Probably Druid though
---
Just play a paladin and yell out scripture while casting rez
---
If it makes you feel any better, its likely confirmation bias rather than the divine blessings of RNGsus.
---
Same issue since update.
---
Exactly. My OG Vanilla server referred to both instances as DM. Most of the time Dire Mail clears would specify a wing so it was obvious. If they didn’t, clicking on the player and seeing their level would make it obvious.
---
They’re real big on moving the goal posts.
---
me too! I spent way too much time looking for loss.
---
Grobbulous is very lively despite being one of the lowest. I'm glad I picked and stuck with it!
---
Should Blizz consider tuning it harder or adding new mechanics to slow progress? Or just add a heroic mode?
---
As a Warlock you always start with immolate, instead of CoA or Corruption So you can tag the mob ;)
---
Jokerd also has done this many times on private servers and was server 1st on the last fresh pserver that came out before classic launched. You’d be dumb not to stream it if you’re in 1st or are about to win, he probably made $10k or more just for getting first 60 and streaming it with no cam and barely talking.
---
&gt; Also I generally disagree with how much you're downplaying the top level difficulty of retail WoW. The game is hard as fuck and has almost no room for error.
---
So acknowledging that single mistakes or a collective inability to cope with terrible RNG can instantly result in a wipe is downplaying the difficulty?
---
Huh, that's a new one...
---
&gt;I guarantee you we'll see these top guilds steamroll Naxxramas on day 1 release, and I bet you they'll have some cheeky strats ready for the artificial gate of the Four Horsemen.
---
[Do you people think before you type?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SF0daJOsKo) 
---
Yes. People who've beaten the raid hundreds of times over the last 13 years will have no trouble beating it again. You retail white knights are the only people who think this is revolutionary breaking news.
---
Seriously, with the tremendous capacity for reading a sentence, receiving the exact opposite message, and then parroting it back acting like it was somehow a refutation of itself combined with the irrational treatment of obvious basic fact as groundbreaking revolutions....
---
I know you hate classic and its fans even more, but you really need to try getting an actual understanding of what the fans actually believe and think.
---
Everything you think you know about classic fans is a carefully crafted lie.
---
You can pretend to be dense all you like but you and I both know what's going on so I don't see who's benefit it's for. Edgy children and teenagers like to invoke nazis when talking about things in relation to US politics. You can claim that your nazi reference had nothing to do with the fact that you were discussing red hats of a particular nature but again, who's benefit is it for? No one else will read this.
---
Cool! On Sulfuras?
---
that is  just twitch plebs .....
---
&gt; Classic is about speed running. 
---
Alternatively, this ease of access means that those of us who prefer to more leisurely quest and level have a good chance of being able to more leisurely raid the end-game when we get there.
---
look for the 'shoot' ability in your spell book (P). It will be under the general tab.
---
It's 16 for aquatic form
---
It's also a ridiculously long quest custom
---
Then I guess it's about good communication then, and competent group leaders
---
If you want to get pedantic with parry haste, you can just time your swings just before the boss attacks. This makes you crit immune to a single target with a swing timer over 2.5s. It so happens that typical bosses have a swing time of 2.5s, which is further slowed by thunder clap.
---
Now is the best time.
---
Because he asked for it? And was very popular due to being the highest level. If I had the opportunity I would have helped.
---
My body is ready.
---
Also my chocolate hat.
---
&gt;That's what happens when the community has been collectively practicing and refining its strategies for 13 years.
---
This is ridiculous. The strategies for these bosses have been known for 14 years, no one has had to refine everything rofl.
---
There are barely any strategies to most of the bosses
---
The only thing "the community has been collectively practicing and refining" is probably how to speed level and reach that content faster, and that is a ***very*** niche community.
---
Pretty sure it's All The Things
---
Jewelcrafting? You mean blacksmithing?
---
Wait what, I thought we all ran off to die at Crossroads and then fend the Horde off at Goldshire in **GLORIOUS BATTLE**
---
If the amount of exp changes, that’s news to me.
---
Keep feeding me I will only get stronger, tasty vanilla rage :)
---
Here I am, just getting my first green and my Voidwalker thinking I was pretty cool.
---
Coming from the crying method fanbase lmao. Some speedrunning autist assblasted all the top Blizzard approved guilds and seeing their baby rage is hilarious.
---
Right there with ya!
---
11... lol
---
Yeah everyone says this because WF is cool and bursty as fuck but it looks like if you crunch the numbers(as the smart bois have), Rockbiter is technically better efficiency. Pretty unfortunate.
---
I really went *in* this weekend and managed to climb to 20
---
Methods raid team isn't playing Classic. They are just streaming the event at a studio in vegas. Unless you think Tips, Sco's girlfriend and Esfand who play on different servers and factions are going to form a raid group.
---
Ok so no posts about world first rag allowed because it was streamed? Sounds cool man.
---
I mean, they had 15 level 55's in their group.
---
Let's be honest, Classic raids are a cake walk compared to even LFR raids in BFA.
---
I’m still 17 but I blame that stupid aquatic form quest tbh
---
I am the late dude. My old guild from Classic all started on a server that is full. Been sitting here for about two hours, and the wait time hasn't moved. But, I might get to play video games with my friends one day.
---
The best players will be attracted by the best guilds though. If you're a top ranking mythic raider aiming to succeed in Classic instead of BfA why wouldn't you be applying to guilds like APES?
---
Sounds exciting.
---
Funny cause it’s true. All of it.
---
Yeah it's always fun to go with the flow and see where your adventures will take you. One minute I'm hunting raptors in The Barrens, the next I'm rescuing a prisoner of war from an internment camp. It's wild.
---
Auto mage farming, skip through his vods to see the locations he does it at.
---
Nothing too special besides his consistent execution of aoe farming, he barely dies and rarely misses
---
ergo, not just anyone could do it
---
LOL that is absolutely beautiful.
---
No. You need to have active game time to play classic. That laptop should be fine also, i play on a laptop from 2011 with an intel hd 4000 and I'm getting 60 fps on the default graphics settings. This is a 15 year old game, any computer built since then should be able to run it fairly easily.
---
I looked at the fps and busted out laughing
---
What did you expect ?
---
&gt;Should I recall right
---
thats some powerful evidence right there
---
Honestly, it's like saying retail levelling requires 1 braincell, and vanilla levelling requires 3. Making my microwave dinner takes 500.
---
The point being, both are so pathetically non existent in terms of challenge it's whatever really.
---
Its a fantasy game...
---
Ahh 9 fps, nice. I feel like half the difficulty back in the day was constantly battling the input lag.
---
My first time in ashenvale was yesterday... I stopped dead too. It was my first PVP zone and I got ganked
---
You can't rely on the "estimated" wait time. 10,000 in line is about 5 hours. Lvl 30 Hunter here. Waited plenty.
---
Haha I didn't, but I saw a lot of folks talking about heading off to raid the Horde so I don't doubt it!
---
Explain that last sentence to someone who's not been into WoW lately.
---
W-wow, what a great audience!
---
Yeah Idk the other guys but Ziz and Nugiyen are Path of Exile streamers lol
---
imagine being this salty at a salty comment about being salty
---
Anti-AFK seems to have been addressed now anyway, jump/run macros and even the script to decline the logout no longer work.
---
That was not an opinion. You tried to pass that off as fact.
---
&gt; Edit: and tbf, some people have taken the opposite stance (retail's got harder end game content) to (classic is piss easy and has no challenges).
---
Classic IS piss easy and has no challenges. Something doing unavoidable excessive damage to you is not difficulty.
---
fat rip, im just gunna start leaving my pc open on wow 24/7 lol
---
Here I am. Level 17 working 4 days a week
---
Again, are yall really digging out old posts? It's really, really not that serious.
---
You mean people having different opinions than you?
---
Nothing of what you said is hard. It just takes a ton of time, but even that is reduced because they did everything while in parties.
---
I'm still worried about the Clan Battlehammer demonstrations though.
---
One of the realms they added on launch day so it's high population.
---
many other games have more reasonable looking boss fights
---
You should watch the rag down where the entire 40 man raid gets wiped to one Warlock (i think) and he takes the last 1% of rag down himself.
---
Roll tide!! from Bama-Kromcrush
---
Wholesome
---
99% sure the patch classic wow is using is after the debuff limit was removed.
---
Being good at something new and bring able to learn quickly "good enough" is a different skill than honing an old game to perfection though. Starcraft is like 20 years old and I don't think anyone could touch the pros there, especially method. I get it's a different game, but honing skills of an old sport is generally what people consider great athletes to be. Golfs rules have stayed the same but that doesn't mean tiger woods isn't amazing because it's an old game over 100 years old and you just need to get the ball in the hole (so simple).
---
The next expansion has already launched, and it’s a rollback to vanilla.
---
either go holy or go ret...seal of command on holy is not a good plan.  You can't block while casting a heal so that block talent is a bad choice.  If you want to do some damage in pvp then be a ret paladin, holy spams flash heal and uses blessing of freedom on warriors and that's all you'll have time to do.
---
I would LOVE to see someone write up all the stories we encounter while leveling. Would be interesting to see if any of them lead off into mysterious paths that were never touch again.
---
There’s a reason you’re giving it away for free.
---
Of course you're not running RTX on it, it's an S7.
---
1 button rotations and only being required to move twice in a whole fight....
---
I know we weren't all that skilled in 2005 but we are now lol
---
He was probably thinking the same thing about some other game or the gym or even just getting home and watching TV lol.

---
He peaked at 283k and has clocked 10 million viewer hours this month. He's easily making hundreds of thousands of dollars just this month alone. He also has a [networth of $2 million](https://naibuzz.com/how-much-money-asmongold-makes-on-twitch-net-worth/) which is just gonna keep rising with how much he has exploded this past year.
---
Look dude I'm not an asmongold fan either, but he has made and will continue to make million**s** of dollars playing WoW.
---
Who claims this? Where are all these magical people claiming classic raiding is harder than current wow?
---
Every vanilla player will tell you that vanilla wow raids are mechanically very, very easy. No one is claiming they are hard.
---
Tbh they probably have more /played since launch than most people would have in weeks.
---
That being said, they are fast and efficient as fuck at doing whatever they did to level, farm, gear up etc.
---
This isn't their first vanilla rodeo
---
Everyone is wrong.
---
It's CB...cause we all know why we were there.
---
Am i right?
---
They will be in high demand for dungeons.  A bit oversaturated for raids probably.
---
And it's not the first time they have beat a lot of those guilds.
---
Diabolical
---
I've also noticed it's only people who call it vc that complain when people call it dm, and not the other way around.
---
How dumb are you?  Buying gold is against the TOS, plain and simple.
---
Troll somewhere else, idiot.
---
The main thing that made MC accessible to more people wasn't any nerfs (I'm not aware of anything significant there), but rather ZG being released.
---
These guys just had MC on farm in private servers for years, and the reality is 40 people who know exactly what they are doing won't have a problem.
---
Props to them. Maybe I could do that when I was in my teens but not 15 years later....
---
😂. Welcome to Azeroth i guess :)
---
this is just excellent. I saw your post and it was in my mind so now im back to make sure i can save it.
---
If you’re not being sarcastic, that is one of the best Warrior items in the entire game.
---
Practicing? They've just been playing the game, changing servers when necessary.
---
I doubt that. This a long raid that has lots of different gear requirements
---
We enjoy it?
---
I feel like this entire mindset needs to stay in retail, it won't but it should imo.
---
it's also the nerfed version of the rag fight; i think people could kill the orig version now but they nerfed it a few months after release. people stomped it after it was nerfed
---
If people find MC challenging in 2019 then they might literally be retarded.
---
Asking the real questions
---
Dude, wtf are you doing? This guy has been posting these same nonsense sentences in many posts on the sub.
---
World First and 0 nerd screams. Explain to me how successfully you were able to recapture the lightning in a bottle?
---
In Vanilla, the first truly hard boss was Twin Emps. And that was mostly because healers didn't know how to heal and couldn't last as long as they needed to on that fight unless they cancelled heals.
---
There was the stupid wurm, but that was only hard for alliance.
---
I saw this post last night and giggled a bit because I knew it'd be down today or the next day. Did none of you play pservers?
---
Doesn't lava do damage every time you jump out in vanilla? At least I remember that jumping would cause you to take more damage than just swimming through. But then again those memories are 15 years old so...
---
My current strat at 28 is CoA corruption, then wand or drain life. Tap and drain to stay around 80% hp/mana. It’s a bit slower without immolate , but I can chain pull without issues. No break needed
---
You and i have had different experiences my friend.   
---
First i couldnt pay for my subscription because the act/bliz payment servers were down for a good amount of hours before and during launch.   
---
Then i bought gametime from Amazon, but i couldnt redeem the code because that involves the same blizzard payment servers, which were down.   
---
Then i saw that US server problems were solved and i bought US gametime. But, a good 4 hrs into launch, of course ALL the servers would have a queue. Herod had a 22000 queue. Good times.   
---
At the break of dawn, early as 7 am well into launchday and perhaps even having past it, i was stuck staring at a screen with 2 login queues. One EU, one US. Both exceeding 3 hours waiting time.   
---
I decided to give it 2 hrs, and then decide if i should go to bed or not. Spoilers; i went to bed. I kept my logins running, set up a sound/alarm that would wake me once i logged in. That failed, slept a full 8 hrs, and only started the day after. Already behind on most ofmy guild who could only say:  
---
Hurrr, you shouldve reserved your name and shouldve gotten gametime earlier. 
---
Well excuse me for refusing to pay for a game i cant play yet.
---
Some of that's a practical concern, where you need bosses to be extra huge just so that all of the melees in the raid have room to hit the boss.
---
Yes tht is my point it's easy. What will be the draw to keep players for endgame content after grinding out mind numbing levels when tht content will be cleared in 1 run and gear checks becoming non existent. Ive read and watched alot about the hype for classic and people posting about the want for blizzard to make a classic server for years. I expected the game to be atleast somewhat challenging and engaging, which it sadly isn't. Though I guess you guys got what you wanted, an ultimate casual experience.
---
All my "friends" leveled without me.
---
Cant call one better than the other IMO, very different games. I really enjoy both ESO and classic :) 
---
But yeah they a lil salty
---
g’Hey!!!
---
I just dinged 58. =)
---
the orig version of the rag fight was harder in terms of raw numbers; this is the nerfed version
---
Hopefully you get answers I’m looking to switch there too and also am PST
---
\+1
---
Remember when this subreddit claimed Classic raids would be a rude awakening for all those private server heroes?
---
average person doesnt play wow
---
Turns out it's way easier in retail than classic lol.
---
Oh you just killed rag too? Why didn't you tell us?
---
I’m just enjoying levelling as a class who can do a bit of everything :)
---
Tell me about it, I just want to come past to do do my pally q
---
Nope! Jewelcrafting allows you to fashing jewels and metals into jewelry and trinkets. Eventually it allows your to cut stat-boosting gems (that can be mined in high level areas) that can then be equipped to gear and weapon sockets
---
Why do I keep seeing "Ragna" as short for Ragnaros? It's always been Rag.
---
+1 for shadowed if it’s available for classic. It’s extremely customizable and you can get some great unit frames with it.
---
This aged well
---
Thanks. :-) You might want to check out my other comments in this thread. Understanding the general idea behind the 1)hit table (pushing off crushing blows), 2)block rating and 3)block value and 4)Defense stat is important in classic. Knowing how these are different and how they interact helps a player make decisions on talents and gear as a tank.
---
What's the difference between this an a auto clicker on the same interval
---
So ya you were wrong, but how do you and your friends feel? Are you embarassed by your cockiness?
---
I have never seen him be anything but a filthy neckbeard streamer.  Sleeping on cam, calling himself god, circumventing the afk auto kick, having guild members bow and pay tributes, telling chat to report a specific horde player because he died, and babyrage over internet issues.  There are no redeeming qualities here, and whats worse is that hes nothing special, other people are leveling faster, completing raids and if pvp were relevant right now somebody would fill that gap too.  Asmon is a personality, the epitome of assclown toxic gamer.
---
You have yet to show that his numbers are close to Ninjas at his peak. I'm not hating I just want evidence for random internet claims.
---
The only player at the event who actually tried to get wf 60 is a guy from the guild Progress. Hes also a Method streamer, but not part of the Method guild.
---
Who is Method? I'm out of the loop here
---
My priest is level 12! After finishing Dun Morogh, I stopped questing to level tailoring, enchanting, and weapon skills, including unarmed. Got a couple levels just from farming the cloth. I might even tackle secondary professions before moving on to Loch.
---
I've enjoyed Classic, TBC, Wrath, MOP, and Legion. Cata, WOD and BFA were pretty garbage. Maybe they'll get back to making decent xpacs next time.
---
We already know success for this means a BC version. Not some new expansion to Classic wow.
---
Hook line and sinker lmao...you got baited so hard
---
You don’t need T3 to do 4HM.
---
On the flip side, the name I wanted more than anything, taken MOMENTS after reservation came up, hasn't logged on once since Classic launched. I was ready to make so many offers, and now I'll offer every bit of gold I have (20 so far) if I can get Time on Herod. I'm so salty it was likely taken for an alt name :(
---
Man what a joke I can't believe he abused layering.  Excuse me while I go raid SM with 3 mages and aoe down all of cath in 1 pull.
---
&gt; The reason it's 1.12 is because that's the reference client they had available, not because they were desperate to cater to pserver players.
---
Or it was what most private server ran so it was the most obvious patch, that people would want
---
It's unprecedented because everyone has cheesed the sharing mechanic.
---
Just make sure you race to 60 fast enough to afford the cheap mount training before we get it patched to have the costs switched.
---
They were forgotten because they were shit. God how much I hated garrisons.
---
well they were wrong, just not how people might have thought
---
You’re just blatantly hating now. We had a speedrunning leaderboard on barrens.chat months before classic and my dude was killing it. He had a server first 60 on a recent pserver launch as well..
---
That was my feeling. Should I raid to see the content? Well thats all available on LFR... Should I raid for gear? Well it will all be irrelevant next cycle its not even a big upgrade for the next few months.
---
your consistency to  land attacks plummets based on the level of the mob. Quest where the mobs are 1 level below you, if u can. The difference should feel night and day
---
Nuke and turtle?
---
But also I think you only need to be 55 for it.
---
PvP will be the long game of classic.
---
Stands for vancleef
---
I read the tram works from 1.13 up but it’s on the net so maybe I got the wrong info ?
---
wtf are you on about.  Vanilla wow was the most Raid or Die the game has ever been.  There is no other endgame pve content in this thing.
---
Ironically enough, it was their hunter that was one of the slowest to level. Dungeon cleave groups are no joke.
---
Offhand hits do half damage. But yeah you still on average do significantly more damage dual wielding.
---
Jesus fuck RIP headphone users.
---
U have like 20 US servers and only a handful are PvP. Just pick one and enjoy
---
I’m rolling a pvp server and the second I hit hillsbrad I grouped with 4 other randos for hours to improve the grind and also protect against horde grinding. 
---
I haven’t had to group while leveling since Wrath.
---
They could have released a pristine 1.2 server and this likely would have been the same result.
---
Blue balls
---
Ok thanks sounds reasonable. I appreciate your answer :)
---
It work have him ride to your start zone, he can do all the quests with you
---
Good
---
IIRC, OH has a 50% damage penalty, without talents.
---
So two swords hitting with base 75% hit chance is probably more like 1.125\*dps.
---
How the actual fuck did y’all make to 60 so fast?
---
I mean....and this game has been out for 10-15 years....
---
Not if it goes down this fast 🤔
---
Exactly, he had world first either way..
---
Yeah it says no user found. He gone.
---
Holy shit already? 
---
People fucking hardcore hahaha
---
That's awesome. I plan on leveling a mage for the next  phase of the game, do you have any advice? I never leveled alliance to 60 in vanilla.
---
Is it called shadowbolt? Warlock's one spell
---
Ok thanks for your answer :)
---
I feel like it will change fast, now people know the 10 man dungeon grind strat being more efficient than anything else and a lot of people will go that route.
---
how old are you?
---
You can literally sort by buyout.
---
The only way to get to fight Ragnaros is to kill every other boss first, so this was a MC clear.
---
Interesting she thinks the female models are all boobs and stuff. I really don't think they are. If anything, I think the male characters are more objectifying than the female.
---
The main nerf to Rag was removing the 1 hr per week timer. The rest were pretty minor tweaks.
---
Aparently it is according to vice and many other SJW jokes.
---
How is this a world first?  I cleared this boss over a decade ago.
---
Do they drop Grey's that sell for a lot, or rather is it viable to farm them for Grey items for how many levels?
---
Fucking legend.
---
Hard ring to get but amazing storyline. Teaches you how to make your First Lady friend with some silk and a few apples.
---
Lmao you noob I'm 21
---
Corpsemaker fuckin wrecks. 400 crits with rockbiter.
---
I like my Shazzrath AH. While you don't make shit with skinning (obviously) I get rich on fishing.
---
I got perma banned for playing Buckfutt. 
---
It's not even obscene.  It's my IRL name. 
---
Trying again with Buckfudder.  
---
Wish me luck.
---
so are you just gonna ignore M+ and mythic raiding?
---
BUT I WAS TOLD CLASSIC WAS GONNA BE HARD! 
---
Finally, the fucking monkeys hailing this game as supremely difficult can shut up. 
---
It's fun, but it's not hard
---
It’s a Top 7-8 populated realm I think you get the best of both worlds with this it. Queues are around 2 hours primetime but late and early in the day there are none. There are more than enough people pacific time of night don’t worry about that.
---
I’m level 25.
---
I might be level 15 but atleast I just made my first gold
---
You do not need to list the rank of the ability.

---
They mentioned in a blizzcon 2018 panel that they are keeping the 16 slot debuff limit. They mentioned how it was bad design, but it was a technical limitation and removing it could cause end game imbalances from what vanilla actually was so for the sake of "classic means classic" they atifically kept it. 
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM at 35:48
---
Yeah, this is primarily a feat of dedication, planning, and stamina.
---
You'd be surprised but not alot depending on how long your going for your 10gb should be fine
---
Yeah some specs have choices they can make, but if I’m Balance druid I’m 38/0/13. If I’m Shadow Priest I’m at least 13/0/30. Most specs only have a few points they can actually make a choice with, but are otherwise pretty coookke cutter.
---
Did you actually buy the game?  You have to buy the base game first, it shouldn't of let you sub without it...  Alternatively if you have multiple starter accounts you might of subbed on a different one.  Support should be able to move the purchased time if that is the case.
---
Wait, I thought when the offer came only some of the Draenei took it, while a small percentage fled with the help of the Na'aru?
---
They should have brought in pre nerf bosses. This is stupid
---
Zandalar
---
that isn't true; were you at any of the first few kills? there's a reason multiple guilds finally killed him within an hour of each other. the strats didn't change they nerfed the fight hard. it's literally the same situation as c'thun but more people don't know about it because they wern't part of the scene
---
And the best part... when I get to actually try to log in the realm is full and there is a queue...
---
I like how all the noobs said that nobody would kill rag week 1 cause classic was so much harder than pserv. Fucking idiots.
---
I get that, and before classic i was watching his youtube.  But since classic hes become worse and worse.  He cant be a better person outside of warcraft because he doesnt exist outside of warcraft.  And after seeing him repirt horde for world pvp im sick to my stomach.  Fuck. That. Guy.
---
Unfortunately for the same reason he’s stuck I am too if I want to play with my friends since they waited so long to release extra servers
---
That it is.
---
    I'd prefer not to upload the guide since Joana's guide is paid. I can tell you in Guidelime that you can create guides just like the default ones. I had to go through the guide and convert the coordinates from this style: (48.43) to [G48,43Elwynn Forest] which is kind of a pain in the ass since Joana's coordinates don't include the zones so I had to do it section by section. To convert quickly if you use an IDE (I use IntelliJ) and replace with this regex with capture 
---
    Find: (\d{1,2})\.(\d{1,2})
---
    Replace: [G$1,$2Wetlands]
---
HOLY FUDGE that place already gives me nightmares. TWO HOURS, I SPENT TWO HOURS THERE. 5 man group refused to let me drink up and solo the key guy I spent 25 minutes waiting for. Took another 45 minutes to kill him again, because he kept spawning where I wasn't. Finally found someone to help, thank goodness he spawned seconds later where my group member was
---
People are quickly going to get their nostalgia shattered prepare for it. It blows my mind that people hyped Classic as being hardcore for so many years.
---
Classic is fun and I'm having a blast with my friend. But this is going to continue to happen everything is going to be smashed into the ground and made to look like a joke. Their is a reason Everquest people called WoW the baby MMO back in the day.
---
Classic wasn't that hard never was. Class balance just sucked compounded on bad internet and people sucking.
---
Congrats!
---
Dude it had been in motions for the past 6 months.
---
The things that I remember being super difficult in vanilla and bc were the attunements and rep grinds.  Just fucking time consuming.  
---
The raid fights were never hard, even back then, if you knew to not stand in fire/slime/etc.  But most people couldn't do that...movement fights were always wipe fests bc most people just lack an awareness of their surroundings.
---
The trinity system
---
This isn't true at all. There were spell power and healing power items in 1.0, they were just really uncommon.
---
I guess EU makes sense. Some of those countries give nice neetbux.
---
Like Ragnaros' Spanish brother or something. 
---
Ragnaro wears a cool hat with a feather in it
---
Deserved, should be forced name changes to a generic random name if you make poorly thought out names for the sake of edge.
---
Gear is really important - but way more for some classes and roles than others. Your tank will absolutely get buttfucked if they don't have the right resist gear, and things like that.
---
However, like you said, information is the big one. Knowledge of what to do, where to get things, how to do things the most efficiently, etc is more important than skill.
---
As someone else in the thread mentioned, a lot of classes legitimately have a 1-button rotation for raiding in classic. You need absolutely zero skill to play a lot of them.
---
You just need the knowledge of the most effective/efficient leveling, where to most quickly get BiS (or close to it) gear for the important roles (tanks, healers), what mandatory things you need for certain fights (tranq shot and the like), and etc.
---
That's like saying dark souls is easy because you can speed run it in half an hour*.
---
*simply make sure you have finished the game 500 times before
---
Probably why the queue times aren’t as bad as they have been.
---
I thought xperl looked like shit even back in vanilla
---
Gotta go fast
---
lmao method really dudded out with that week in vegas i guess.
---
Oh God, imagine 40 people lined up to do the walk to the king, one at a time...
---
Demotivating? Did you expect to be one of the first?
---
I forgot about silithus grind for hydraxian rep so I thought onyxia was going to be cleared first and the rep was going to hold back rag. Not surprised to see him down since the rep can be ground.
---
Yup, grey items! I started farming at 37.
---
And jakenbake
---
I'm just a little ahead of that so don't feel bad. I have about 50hrs and I'm 24.
---
And the interesting thing to me about the GE is, the first time Jagex put it up for a vote it failed. That was why there was that weird trading post system for a while.
---
I never heard anyone use DM for Deadlines until now.
---
If you don't even know what Ninja's numbers are why even ask me for proof? You have no knowledge to contextualize this conversation with, it's just me talking to a brick wall.
---
Feral druids minimal stealth. Shaman. Paladin.
---
Dota 2 is the perfect free to play game, without a shadow of a doubt.
---
Well classic isn’t about your dps it’s about watching your threat and managing your mana/energy/rage.
---
Nope
---
&gt; He used the game mechanics that are part of the game
---
Yes, that's what exploiting is.
---
I'm repeating myself here, but again, I'm not talking about the race, I'm talking about the /played time only. People seem to think I'm trying to undermine his achievement of hitting 60 first which I'm not.
---
Horde. Not warrior, not stelth. You get a shaman or bear druid. Both if them are a bit sub par for dps. A bear is usually a tank/OT and shaman are buff machines.
---
1. MC has always been known as super easy. In fact, the devs tested MC themselves and made it ever more easy and once it went live it was cleared almost instantly. After this they hired actual testers because it turned out, the devs are just really really bad at the game.
---
2. Leveling is harder, mob grinding is harder, dungeons are harder. If you know what you are doing and you have been doing it for the past 15 years, of course you will easily defeat the content.
---
I find leaving the profanity filter lightens up the mood. I know what they are saying but I can find myself laughing at exchanges more often.
---
fire resist / fire protection potion 
---
They used potions btw
---
If they ever add blood elves to Classic+ I hope they use the old high elf models.
---
Definitely yes. The knowledge is something you can soak up quickly.The knowledge isn't something unobtainable. You can read up on it and learn while playing. If the top retail players put in the effort, they'll smoke pserver players. The only way pserver players compete is if they are or were good players in retail before. 
---
The mechanics are super simple in Classic. We already saw the rank 1 glads and the good retail PvPers play Classic to a high level in beta.
---
Sometimes people are in LFG chat and you get excited about a DM group to find out they really meant VC when you shift click them.
---
I remember back then an awful lot of Raiders didn't play other or any video games but wow.  And a lot didn't pvp.  I don't know if that's the case today.  But I do remember those non traditional gamers really struggled in any fight that required movement.  People with fps or pvp experience did not struggle in those fights.
---
10 :')
---
Tagging to find this later to install
---
I don't play retail. Haven't played for the past 4 years and 4 years ago I simply hung out until the next raid began, as I had nothing to do. Which was why I quit about 3 months after coming back.
---
&gt; If you're a top ranking mythic raider aiming to succeed in Classic instead of BfA why wouldn't you be applying to guilds like APES?
---
Dude, you can clear new raids in a few hours. Any guild that isn't filled with shitty braindead people will succeed in Classic. It's too easy.
---
Took me 2 levels to do this
---
A 35 rogue does more damage than a 60 ret paladin...
---
It's a pity someone already posted this, with the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxvi8u/wow_classic_leveling/
---
Do you really though? I am coming from rather small part of PoE community which raced to first level 100s every new league, eventually it devolved into the competition of who can sleep less or not at all with the focus on economy overshadowing actual skill.
---
With an option to kill Rag in 6 days which can surely optimized to 5 or less by sleeping less if you have competition around, yeah thats what gonna happen.
---
Like anything else? If I practice the flute for 10,000 hours is it skill or is it because I spent time on it?
---
&gt; I honestly don't think I have ever seen someone argue that the raids in vanilla were **mechanically** harder than retail.
---
It seems to have become less of a thing in recent years, but for a while people did just that so much that I can remember an interview with a few Paragon members (a top raiding guild) in like 2011-2012ish where they asked them to settle the debate about which raids were the most difficult.
---
Not by me, I am enjoying not knowing what the fuck I'm doing and also looking forward to when I do. Love this game. This is even better than my first time through years ago. I'm duo leveling and it's SO awesome.
---
I've heard of mana regeneration aggro recently... maybe that's a thing here?
---
Ima pepsi man myself.
---
yup
---
It does work though...
---
This isn't true for tanks. For DPS warriors attacking from behind, this also wasn't true. The main thing that hurt warriors were mobs that didn't have hands and attacking those from the front, because block and parry, which refunded rage, were covered to miss, which did not. That meant leveling sucked ass but it would have been a much smaller impact on raid DPS. Not to mention 1.2 Mortal Strike combined with non-normalized weapon damage. 1.0 warriors were still wrecking machines in raids and PvP.
---
Just because a group of professionals that have been doing this for years and have prepared themselves for this, doesnt make the game all of a sudden "so easy omg." Get a grip guys jesus
---
So glad you didn't camera up - in the cockpit.
---
Yeah have him come to you. Since dwarves can be pallies but humans cant be hunters youll both have trainers in your area but not in his.
---
Yeah Rogue sounds pretty cool, the idea of stealth ganking people and pickpocket for money is really cool. I was worried if it would be a good class to learn the game, but I guess you can do that with any class haha
---
Now it comes to the hardest part: race and faction haha
---
I long for an MMO bossfight video where they actually pan up so you can see the guy.
---
never underestimate the power of the combined will of 40 sweaty neckbeards
---
That's correct. Holy suffers the base *miss* resist that +hit negates, but holy specific resistance and spell penetration doesn't exist in vanilla.
---
Especially when the alternative would be thinking they are forming a group for an instance that isn't even in the game!
---
Like how could this be confusing to you, you think they are forming a group that will wait months until dire maul is released?!
---
alright rager. continue your emotional problems.
---
You could hold a ruler up to your monitor if you're really OCD about it? lol
---
Unless you want to start dabbling with mods, doing it by eye is what you got. I used the buttons on the action bar to try an align them but I would not be surprised if better methods existed.
---
The most important question, where did you find a one bag that works?
---
Always found that funny un a lot of quest chains.
---
Wait. Really? Anyone can get a quintessence?!
---
I don't really know anyone that would consider MOBAs to be MMOs. 10 players isn't big.
---
Kinda like saying the guy you're responding to sucks. Could have two very different meanings using the same words/phrase. I dunno why he's so bent out of shape.
---
"Classic is so hard it'll take a month for even the first raid kills"
---
"Someone cleared it on day 4? No this is a private server"
---
"Wait no it's not they must've used exploits"
---
"Well I mean, I expected this to be honest they've played so much. I was talking about the worst players and newbies!"
---
Spell pushback in PVP. Faster attacks mean more attacks=more pushback.
---
Oh I thought paladin is locked to human. Nice thanks
---
Sounds a lot like my own experience (similar ages). My brothers played the game and after a brief stint in Hibernia (Dark Age of Camelot), I fell in love with the idea of the game. Watched my brother play when I could and even took the reigns with my own character alongside a friend.
---
I don't think people should criticize games or media on any forum or post unless the OP is asking for it imo. This goes for all media.
---
Just a taunt. One taunt. Please.
---
Also whats the addon that tells the vendor price etc?
---
Put people in appropriate gear for mythic KJ  and you will see just how absurdly easy classic is.
---
mythic KJ will still be difficult for guilds that cleared it.
---
Retail's challenging content is the group content. Mythic+, mythic (heroic for some) raids. If you haven't been challenged by retail, then it's probably because you're not participating in that content. 
---
I think that is one of the main failings of retail/bfa, is the lack of challenging solo content. Also ties in with the overwhelmingly positive response that the Legion mage tower challenges got.
---
It's possible you got a random dc.
---
You’re guild must be elitist to think you have to be 18 to do deadmines
---
You're literally describing the skill floor right there.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Do you know how bad and broken most classes were before the later patches?
---
Just coming back to wow. My thoughts on this Pserver guild downing Rag this early/fast is it seems normal. They've been doing this for YEARS. When BC/WOTLK was released top guilds cleared normal modes in greens. It's just comes down to being really good at what they do.
---
Not to sound crazy or anything but 4 hrs/daily is NOT casual. The time commitment just gets blurred because of streamer culture - not everyone can play literally 12+ hours a day.
---
bUt ChRiStIe EaTs WeIrD
---
I really hope that's not true. But ret pallies do still bring some utility. Not a ret paladin btw, playing horde, just don't want the whole community to be meta slaves.
---
Bro I'm playing as Twotoe! that's funny. Im on Sulfuras but was originally going herod.
---
No they weren't...
---
Besides, the WF this time wasn't even about the raid it was about getting the most people to high enough lvl to do the raid... This is proven by the fact that they didn't even have a full group of 60s. They had loads of people below 60 with questing greens. Even if Method tried, they'd probably still lose because they haven't spent the last 10 years practising the levelling like Pserver guilds have.
---
Hahaha, I'm 3 bars away from 18 and just waiting and waiting until I can do DM with them.
---
Three cheers for chocolate!
---
That might be because in RL we have social media and cell phones. Quality of life improvements that has changed rl social interaction in way similar to all the QOL improvements retail WOW also has.
---
Morally grey since vanilla baby
---
Wand spec works until about level 30. Things start slowing down significantly due to the lack of decent wand upgrades.
---
For the Alliance -any friendly non-alliance human
---
go smite, mindblast then sw:p so you dont get interrupted
---
Most people back then literally just didn't fill their GCDs with damage causing abilities. People were very very bad.
---
Gotta watch out for that 50 DKP minus!
---
I'm lvl 19 lel
---
i fuck man ass
---
...i fuck man ass?
---
Mythic has taken top guilds about a week. Eternal palace was harder than expected and took almost 2. Also those raid releases all happen after players are leveled and geared so it's 1-2 weeks dedicated to studying boss mechanics.
---
Where? I googled for it, I tried around for it. I haven't found shit about sorting by buyout. If there is a way, please tell me, because I really hate the auctioneer interface. I can sort by name, I level, seller, time and bid. But bid is not buyout and I level just sorts it weird af. For example, an item for 1silver bid and buyout above the same item for 35 copper.
---
It worked well in Storm Peaks, and to a lesser extent Icecrown. Storm Peaks though was peak (heh) game design for flying mounts. It was fucking huge and there was a lot of verticality to the zone. Flapping around on your tiny gryphon or wyvern, it was intimidating and colossal and beautiful. It worked well in Icecrown and even Sholazar too, but it was best in Storm Peaks.
---
Aside from that though, they've just not taken it into acount lol
---
I spend a lot of time drinking to regain mana. 
---
There’s got to be a better way
---
And if you're a speed running purist a 1-60 speed run isn't even really possible since one of the most iron clad rules is "no outside help". Which you are bound to receive in a game like wow.
---
Not till BWL
---
Does Decursive work again in WoW Classic?
---
I don't blame her.  In my eyes I categorize wow into three eras.  The vanilla/bc era, wotlk (up until lfr/lfg patch) and then everything else. There's a lot of fundamental differences they're really not the same game.
---
Good idea (tho tbh I'm mostly doing MindBlast-&gt;SW:P--&gt;Wand

I've had 2 of those since MoP. The only reason I had to change Ysera was because a guy didn't like me and had his guild spam report my name. Bizz couldn't care less
---
apes bwl record is 27minutes.
---
You never needed attunement to enter MC. You just go through BRD. Attunement was primarily added because they put player caps on non-raid zones.
---
Queue times are long because people don’t log out. Unless you’re suggesting that blizzard forcibly remove players after a certain time. Because while that may get you in faster it would keep you out of the game faster as well.
---
Level 21 here
---
Would love to hear your rationale for thinking this
---
Darkshore or Loch Modan!
---
I remember leveling up a priest.  It's gets a lot easier.
---
And then you went to your class trainer
---
I appreciate that these guys have 3 paladins. Feel like they are getting no attention. It’s cool to be different and stand out.
---
And that kids, is how I met your mother.
---
Good! don't need no baby-back bitches on Classic that can't even handle a quest.
---
The amount of experience you get from quests stay the same red - green. It only changes once the quest turns grey.
---
Lol. Damn, your system is better
---
Man I love Classic, but I really wish the raids, dungeons were way more difficult. I also wish the dmg rotations were more difficult.
---
Objectively true more people can do mythic raids than get to 50+ in 4-5 days and accomplish this
---
What level are you?
---
I would advise against buying gear off the AH as gold will be at a premium and you need it for training professions, profession recipes, skills, and your mount.
---
Shaman and windfury totem for your melee friends : )
---
cool
---
If you're Forsaken, probably.
---
It's not usually about a player's mechanical skill but their knowledge of their class and the game. Bringing the correct gear, spec and consumables is massively important and being off on a few things can massively impact your dps.
---
I dont care what anyone says... if you dont have OG prodigy raging in the background its not a full win.
---
Oh your leveling is hard? Id like to introduce you to my world as a Warrior
---
That makes me happy. Thanks mate :)
---
HaHA I am 21 now as of this writing!
---
Simply clearing raids when they are as easy as they are isn't succeeding in a hardcore guild's terms. Check out APES' private server videos: raid speedruns, rank 14 premades, huge world pvp battles, top notch PvP videos by individuals in the guild. This is an environment that empowers skilled players.
---
I’m on a high pop server never had to queue in a couple of days being here.  There is tons of people, in fact, i just refilled a mage from my warrior to level out the sheer grind it is levelling a warrior and I spent a good 25 minutes trying to get 4 pieces of crystal kelp at the lakes by gold shire because there was wayyyy to many hunting merlocks at the same time as me. It’s lit man
---
Nope every word I said was true.
---
ok
---
How old are you that you still haven't come to the realization that other people could have perfectly good reasons for caring about things you don't? Please don't try giving advice until you have a better understanding of the world around you.
---
Forsaken are the bad guys.
---
You can twink out!
---
\*after a thorough inspection\* 
---
k
---
If you consider the entire game being the leveling process, then sure.
---
The other camp doesn't consider the game even started yet until level cap. Then you die all day long (Mythic+, raids, arena).
---
&gt; Teenagers when wow was released (I was 19)
---
I was 8, and I used to watch my uncle play every day after school.
---
It's really not so bad with the Peggle addon.
---
Comparison is the thief of joy...
---
This sub is filled with “x “abused” layering to hit 60” “the cleared MC too fast” “people are power leveling dungeons and that’s not “how it’s supposed to be”
---
My response is the same WHO CARES?! Play the game you want to play. Why compare yourself against min/maxers and speed players that make up 5-10% of the community. Enjoy it for what it is, an amazing time...
---
But that’s just my 2 cents
---
Hunter’s tranquilizing shot.
---
Arugal (Oce PvP) has had 3 hour queues at peak time most days for me, 4k or 5k people in queue.
---
Was kind of hoping that there wouldn't be so many PvP servers to avoid the decrease in players in a few weeks/months.
---
lolllllllll I did this too with my Hunter. I thought I had to make it like me or something over time and that's when their spell tab would show up. Turns out its a spell in your book to train them. Wondered why pets were shitty and couldn't hold threat, they didn't know growl. &gt;.&gt;
---
Agreed. I don't understand why he think he needs to defend it.
---
Sure, you can't compare previous records with the layering one, but who honestly cares. This reality drama tv bullshit has to end.
---
I wonder if they were all 60s
---
Lmao
---
I think most of them actually used dungeons from level 45 because its not that much slower but you actually get good gear from it which makes doing MC easier.
---
Ah that's too bad. Thanks for getting back to me though :)
---
I had time to make this meme while dueling my Rouge friend
---
They did but said they might leave it in 1 day or a special event day
---
This didn't age well. Ragnaros is down. Plenty of people is 60.
---
It’s a good opener. Smite -&gt; SWP -&gt; wand
---
&gt;First it was race to 60
---
I only ever saw it announced and advertised as its full 1-60+MC+Ony.
---
It’s really just a game my guy. It’s not that deep.
---
Well this comment aged poorly. Despite the "negative" impact his pserver experience had, he somehow mamaged world first 60.
---
I miss transmogging and all my companion pets. 
---
Other than that, spot on.
---
Dual spec is nice, but I would totally vote for the Focus frame, myself.
---
HARD TO BEAT THE TRINITY SYSTEM
---
Does the queue go faster if you fly east.
---
What do I name my Female Dwarf Rogue? I'm thinking Olga, Selma, Bernadette, Phyllis or Wilma
---
Ffxiv scrub. Could someone explain why this is such a big deal? In 14 it takes about as much time to hit 60 (or 80 the current cap) if you're grinding like crazy. What's going on here that makes it so special?
---
I'd take guild banks
---
You not knowing what they're racing towards doesn't mean they moved any goal posts.  Its been Rag+Ony for as long as I've been aware of the stream.
---
nobody was getting their accounts stolen in 05' it was all Asian farmers who actually made money and wanted to do it. If this was a thing in 05 I wouldve heard about it. I'm 90 percent certain everyone who is downvoting me didn't play in 05'. I'm 100 percent certain most of them are laughably over invested in a video game. 
---
I'm sharing an anecdote and if I went back to 05' I would buy more gold at that exact same time. Freshman year of college isn't meant to be spent grinding on a video game. I actually had no idea how toxic this community was - I'm glad I know that the whole "more than a feeling" shit is fake and that deep down the community is just as bullshit as any other video game.
---
I understand your point, however, and will not be planning on buying gold if its leading to people stealing accounts which is more of a Blizzard security problem than anything else. I'm not down for that. If it was just Chinese farmers I wouldn't care - nobodies going to stop them and people don't have time to take 2 week vacations grinding an MMO in the real world.
---
 D A M A G E 
---
C O N T R O L
---
You can check wow classic at "can i run it" - should give you an idea of minimum vs recommened specs.
---
Hells yes. I’m off in 8 hours, gonna enter queue get a nap and start the grind.
---
You're comparing corporate America to civilized China that's not even like apples to oranges that's like monster trucks to betta fish.
---
Again just another stupid redditor grasping at straws trying to prove another stupid point that doesn't exist because he can't admit the fact that someone else is right.
---
in China it goes all the way down to the level of the people that live in each entire household from school grades to games on the playground all the way up to corporate China and politics and everything in between like video games street racing farming manufacturing you name it. it's ingrained in the culture of every single person raised in the country to cheat to win at any cost it's acceptable socially and openly. did you not deny it they're not ashamed of it it's not a secret so quit trying to pretend that it is cuz it's not.
---
that's the difference between that and corporate America which are a bunch of line bankers are trying to trick everybody into thinking they're honest when they're not.
---
if anything we're worth cuz we're a bunch of fucking idiots thinking that they're telling the truth and that they're not lying when they really are lying at least in China is straight of saying we're a bunch of cheaters and then we are going to be this has been cheating harder than us hahaha.
---
The grass is always greener on the other side...

Not sure. I did learn that they're pouring potions into the ocean and turning the frickin' murlocs gay.
---
No achievements as far as I'm aware. So no triggers for WF.
---
There is a difference between being harder and being more time consuming.
---
nah i played horde and dm is deadmines still to me.
---
I think so
---
If private servers are anything to by, it won't. Everyone knows MC (and most classic raiding tbh) is a complete joke when it comes to difficulty, but still sub optimal classes usually aren't wanted.
---
Science!
---
nope. if you know how to hop, you take zero lava damage
---
Yep will do, quick question about weapons for your recommended talents, sword-shield is the way to go right? Also is shield spike a requirement or is it just a nice bonus?
---
Cool for them.  I just hit 11 and I'm enjoying every quest.
---
Yes I have a LVL 14 druid decided that was a shit time so I made a paladin but then I decided that night elves were indeed the biggest babes so I made a hunter too
---
UBRS  in a pug with a bunch of undergeared monkeys.
---
Frost is for leveling, raiding early tiers, and PvP.  Fire is for raiding in later tiers and I guess being a one-trick pony every 3 minutes as PoM Pyro in PvP.
---
I use Mind Blast first personally
---
Oh man I just found mine yesterday too. Took a similar amount of kills
---
Lola, I totally forgot about that!  I do remember having to tell people to not stand in fire and they'd say "I don't see it".  Totally forgot about the shitty hardware issues.  Lol those were the days.
---
Always wanted to try some kind of WOW but know nothing about it. Is it like RuneScape where you can have fun soloing most of the game and doing lots of story/quests or is it more about guilds/parties/raids?
---
Oh sorry man I didnt realise that in order to be a part of this conversation I had to memorize ninjas numbers, something that you yourself clearly havent done.
---
What route did you take to get there? 
---
Me and my housemates want to do DM after WV
---
I hope I win the empty layer... Took 4 hours to level up from 10 to 11 in westfall because there is nothing left to kill.
---
wish i took up skinning lol
---
Is this guy apart of their world first race?  Jeez the competition is weak compared to &lt;APES&gt;
---
\* Mindless Self Indulgence - Straight to the video starts playing \*
---
The corrupted blood epidemic happened at ZG release which was 1.7 and Classic is using 1.12's code (despite ZG not being out yet), so it's not gonna happen again unless they deliberately include it.
---
You should at least opt for a 7 gal bucket. Might be more chair height too for ease and flow.
---
I showed you my hammer now answer me
---
They were not. 26 60s
---
As if people on Reddit are one singular person huh?
---
They don’t and it’s dumb
---
I grouped with a hunter tonight named blowjob!
---
We have a guild falling apart since the rush groups need to stay on the high pop server since they won't have time to play after they hit 60 while the guys who only play 2-4 hours have to play on a low server just to be able to play... this is a tough situation for both sides to deal with and people ate getting mad at friends over this...
---
Do you live under a rock?
---
Lots of reasons. Today's computers and internet are quite superior to the ones people had 15 years ago, so people aren't disconnecting as much right now. Also, back then, people didn't know what the fuck they were doing. People have had 15 years of practice. There's also the fact that back then servers crashed A LOT and I'm sure there were a lot more bugs. Also, the patch we're playing on isn't the same patch that MC was released in. There's been lots of class tuning and changes to how loot works.
---
Yet most pugs will miserably keep failing there
---
I wonder if this is a NA thing because I've never heard of VC before the classic beta.
---
yes :) whole sub mentality :)
---
WoW at launch had 8 debuff slots, not 5.
---
If you played for a few levels it felt dead because everyone is out of the starting zone by now.
---
MOAR DOTS
---
Rikh is a pserver player. 
---
He's also an original vanilla player. Just like most of the others too
---
You are correct that a disproportionate amount of threat comes from holy damage. However a paladin's threat generation is very good with the basic untalented Righteous Fury. After all, a Ret paladin can pull aggro off a warrior tank without even having Righteous Fury up.
---
I'm going off of experience. My main was a paladin tank in classic. Granted that experience was 13 years ago now. Points into Righteous Fury is one of those things that each individual player tweaks based on gear and circumstances. It is better to not have it as much as possible. It is just a threshold. "Enough" is enough. The real problem is if there is a big gear (or skill) discrepancy between the tank and the dps players. If a paladin is doing low level dungeons with pugs and having threat issues then the first thing they should look at is their gear. If their weapon and shield is current then threat really shouldn't be an issue.
---
Note that if someone pulls off of you, it is not like you are without tools just because you don't have a taunt. First thing to do is stun the mob. Next is you can hit the puller with Blessing of Protection. Then there are heals. Heals are very threat intensive in classic. Except you are a paladin and have heals. You can pull mobs back by healing with Righteous Fury up.
---
first time playing it today and can confirm I thought it was so shit
---
from my point of view, the jedi are evil
---
Wetlands - Red Whelps, Crimson whelps, and flamesnorting whelps. Lost whelps do not drop it. You can find them on the east side of the zone in the big green area on the map, on either side of the road that goes East into the mountains
---
Dawg, its 2006.
---
1.2 warriors were only bad at leveling.
---
Remember that all they did was probably dungeon farming for max xp gain. Personally I dont enjoy that style of leveling but I have to admit it is a lot faster(almost double) then regular questing.
---
I’ve got 10 times the gold you do, I’m the richest man in Azeroth.
---
I'm waiting until I have money and for servers to die down a bit
---
Honestly, I kinda like the lack of transmog. It gives your gear pieces more identity that just some stats.
---
Which lends even more credence to the fact 10m low level dungeons arent a very effective way of leveling lol
---
More social, can't solo it, you will need to interact with others in the game
---
Some of us don't have any of what you mentioned so we play long hours for months on end.
---
Believe it or not it’s my MacBook Pro (2016). Classic can run on a potato thankfully lol
---
Is that an add-on or does it always pop up like that when auction sells?
---
BLUE balls.
---
Hope you did the protection stance quest.
---
Unexpected factorial
---
I will say I have noticed that issue and don’t know exactly why.  Mostly because blizzard has told us so little on layering. Sometimes I get on a layer that’s fucking hopping. And sometimes I get on a layer more reminiscent of my medium pop vanilla server. If I get uncomfortable I just have a friend invite me to a new layer though.
---
Presumably the person on track to be fastest would be known though, by virtue of being fastest... Which afaik is what happened here?
---
Leveling is easy when there's no xp penalty for dying.
---
"I killed ragnaros in under a week"

"Yeah,so?"

---
People on my server are trying to sell this for 50g who has 50g that is level 19?
---
molten core is by far the easiest 40men raid in vanilla lol
---
Initially yes, but in my other comment I stated that since so many people decided to make bags the value has dropped to 0 so they're just being given away for free. Still, this encourages a friendly environment in game so it's a good thing.
---
Bigglesworth has a good pop and everyone is chill.
---
You are correct, they typed it not said it.
---
Did you clear the raid yet?
---
I quit classic today
---
Gonna be launching it up again tomorrow tho
---
I mean, at those rates I have friends that would pool together and make a few hundred bucks without question lol
---
What?
---
New servers are not a problem for such companies, trust me. And you don’t need more devs... After Phase 6 Classic will basically be done in terms of recreating the vanilla version. This was my exact point, a team that worked for Classic could move to developing DLCs.
---
Uh, it's about the raid and it's relevance to vanilla raiding. It seems very relevant.
---
No? All of that sounds extremely dull.
---
Walking into Org is hell at that level.
---
WHERE ARE YOU NOW? HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO SWAP A LAYER, TELL ME? Does it have a fucking cooldown on it or do you instantly get a new instance? do you wnna take back the bullshit u said now? hm?
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Classic Wow. The play style is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the nuances in rotations will go over a typical players head. There's also your class trainers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation - their personal philosophy draws heavily from panderan literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Classic Wow truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the murlocs existential catchphrase "Mrglrlrlrlrllr" which itself is a cryptic reference to Illidan's epic War of the Ancients. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Classic Wows genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Classic Wow tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own.

Sure thing. Literally impossible.

Very few MMOs are largely challenging. Often the challenge *is* the time investment. It can be challenging to do something for a long period of time - which is why it’s important that some updates that make things significantly faster shouldent be written off as “oh well it was always *easy* now it’s just *faster*.”
---
You are being toxic you're just not adult enough to realize it.
---
Efficient? Maybe, you can be high on health and mana if you pull only one mob. You can only go shadow for Leveling. A priest needs to play in group or do dungeons really. Solo questing is not for him, same goes for warrior.
---
Yeah... after a bunch of #changes
---
Yeah blizz please please bring this back!
---
MC mobs for past honored.  You also only need 1 person with the quintessence and you can camp out a team to summon them back and forth.
---
Funny, that's what I thought about OP.
---
I had a feeling I've seen you before this and now I know, I was right lol.
---
As a shaman.. yep!
---
Indeed they were. My guild (which has long since disbanded) still had issues with people playing on toasters until cataclysm. It was around then most of us got good jobs after college and could afford better PCs. I do truly miss those days, which is partly why I’m loving classic again.
---
Well he was a full day slower wasn't he.
---
Yet there will still be plenty of people who keep wiping at MC
---
Deletme
---
Classic uses the 1.12 debuff limit, which is 16, and includes a priority system to protect raid critical debuffs from being knocked off by procs. 1.2 had 8 slots and no priority system, but even so it's not like that would have affected APES ability to clear MC at all. They only had 3 warlocks and good DPS warlocks didn't use dots in raids in Vanilla.
---
You'll appear offline on b.net but people logged into classic can still see your character logged in.
---
&gt;Onyxia is even easier
---
They're wiping on Ony.
---
what's up now? how hard is it to abuse?? Day 5 of launch, you need ANY mob that's been killed, you type "invite to a diff layer" in your OWN GUILD and you instantly get teleported to a new instance with new mobs, new stock supplies on limited supply vendors, new everything, NO COOLDOWN WHATSOEVER. 
---
Talk now. let me hear you bullshit.
---
Yeah I might be wrong but even if I am it's an amazing addon to have. Shows you all quests you've completed in the zone you're in and will tell you the quest chain path if there is one.
---
I had no hidden agenda bud I was just pointing out a comparison that was incredibly relevant. Why are you so paranoid? Like wtf do you mean by man up? Can you please do the impossible task and just explain yourself properly. I dont know what the hell you are on about.
---
Yes, after Jages stepped up and introduced a bunch of #changes.
---
Still want to apply that line of thought to Classic?
---
So what is more time consuming on it? People laid Rag literally within 5 days. Can't be that time consuming am i right?
---
I gave you a reason what is harder and why it is harder. All you said "it is more time consuming" inhowfar is dying because patrolling mobs will get you and you having trouble killing mob camps more time consuming? It is the literal definition of a game being hard, when you have trouble beating stuff in the game.
---
Damn priest have been pretty fast for me. Wand is clutch
---
And your professions?
---
* Skinner

* Analrapist
---
They wiped :(
---
You no longer have to buy the base game. Just the latest expansion.
---
If you look at the announcement made two weeks ago you will see it is called the Classic Race to World First, including the rush to 60, the first MC and Onyxia clears.
---
Only because you hate something it doesn't mean you have to warp facts just to make it look bad.
---
1 wipe at about 30%. They couldn't get threat when she landed.
---
No suprise at all, everyone who raided classic seriously knows how easy MC is
---
Hehe I just thought your name was a laugh about it, but yah I assumed it was ok FFA! Gratz
---
And all of them are correct. Well done.
---
That's why I made my friends play with me =)
---
Method got destroyed? What method are you talking about? A bunch of streamers there to pull in viewers and cash? You do realise that there are about 5 raiders from their active roster playing classic. Most of their streamers are playing casually and are level 40ish and above. Im glad you find so much satisfaction in seeing the best guild probably to ever play world of warcraft lose at a game that requires very little skill and a lot of grinding.
---
Congrats! I'm dreading trying to get crimson whelp.
---
The correct way to phrase that is that private servers are severely over tuned.
---
Does this apply to friends of your character, or to you playing the game? As in, can I roll a new character without them noticing?
---
I had this issue with my old desktop - once it got too hot performance plummeted. Happens to my current craptop now. I tried a coolimg pad, with and without external fans. Ultimately, i bought a smal usb fan that i can position to blow under and through bottom (the exhaust is on the bottom, so the fans attached to the pad were actually blowing hot air back up into the laptop).
---
As someone completely new to WoW I have learned a fair amount about the game from that stream. 
---
Even then I can tell it's a kind of scuffed and unenthusiastic event.
---
Not obscure. Trained many wisps to harvest my lumber back in the day.
---
How do you stand it?  You can't quest anywhere because there's too many people.
---
imagine wiping with both salvation and wear ward... jesus yikes
---
Sounds about right, used to bring late 58s healers all the time.
---
Sulfuras
---
Gotta agree. The most toxic people in my guild are the hardcore retail players. They also can't stop talking about fucking retail, and when they talk about vanilla (which only maybe 10% of them played) they talk down about it and act like they're fucking experts on every little detail and mechanic.
---
My ass hurts looking at this...
---
Wow i thought this would be at least a month from release its been god damn 6 days.
---
I remember avoiding the capital cities due to lag my first two years playing!  Shat in particular was a nightmare to get around.  I remember getting a new pc and going there and finally seeing how it was multi leveled and it made sense.  Lol
---
There were a few method fan boys I saw claiming that retail guilds would shit on pserver progression. These pserver guilds have played the same shit for years.
---
I played alliance in vanilla. He wasn't a hard fight for us either. The spinny bitch was definitely harder to learn. After her that warm was an easy kill. That spear was so fucking good!
---
Nah man ND it was cleared within hours of it's release. The first reset had at least 10+ guilds who cleared it
---
Just friends of your in-game character, if you appear offline and made a new character they would have no idea.
---
After about 5 minutes of trying to find a peacebloom infront of me, only to be nabbed by a bloody paladin, this is one of those WPT's (Wow Pro Tip)
---
Than his own records on pservers? Yeah. Compared to existing records from vanilla? No.
---
Stoned out of our gourds
---
Your margins are incredibly wrong or you're intentionally being misleading. I'm inclined to believe it's the latter. "60/100" for the hardest vanilla content is extremely fucking generous compared to cutting edge content in retail.
---
Grind some mobs for a level. That’s what I always do when I get I to that situation. Find the biggest hardest things I can actually take 1v1 and work some tactics.
---
Thank you so much!
---
It was hard because of 40 people needing coordinating and also information was shitty, too.  You couldn't just look up the perfect strat or if there was one it was something hardcore that my ragtag guild wasn't about to get ready for in anything less than months of pure death.
---
I feel for ya, that's how I felt the first time this happened to me on a pserver. I was finishing up barrens on a fresh launch and heard that (possibly a lot of the same guys) people had already cleared mc/ony, less than a week from launch. And this has been the norm for years now.
---
You'll get over it if you remember why you play the game.
---
Have you tried pulling a camp of mobs the same level as you, 2 of them being casters? You either sprint far enough away to bait 2 of them or die.
---
Naxx isn't planned for another year or so...
---
I've hit 13 like 2.5 times now because I keep realm hopping. First one was because people I knew were gonna probably be there, second because population sucked, third because newer realm where I was able to reserve names that I wanted.
---
The most confusing part of this is that the wow classic community should be trying to bury this news.  Their baby, the WoW classic experience they have been posting "You think you do, but you don't" memes for years has just been completely nullified.
---
The end boss of WoW as it stands has been defeated in 6 days by players that weren't even level 60.  This is bad news for Classic's longevity for those of us that were hoping to enjoy the long haul.
---
Because it isn't blizzards problem that you as an individual have decided not to move.
---
This post is hilarious, tyvm
---
These 'world firsts' sure are great.
---
I wouldn't be that excited about beating content I beat several times 15 years ago either. Especially when I know that said content is sub LFR difficulty.
---
Legend
---
&gt;Class order halls were a great addition and now they are completely deserted.
---
still see a lot of deathknights around my hub, but i guess thats only because they made the class hall archeus...
---
I'm level 12878 in queue.
---
This sub: nah dude that one balance druid providing 3% crit to 4 warlocks with imp shadow bolt, he's gonna cause the raid to wipe on Lucifron
---
I unironically think its one of the most disrespectful things.
---
no lmao
---
BWL &amp; AQ won’t need more than an hour to be cleared. And Naxx about 3-4 hours.
---
So much rage in this thread lol. 
---
They did it. It was legit. Calm down you will still wipe to mc mechanics because you are bad.
---
Least he got chicken!
---
Cool post, would be better if you used some sort of Rime scheme.
---
Cleared
---
It's not, it's just having a free weekend as a try-before-you-buy marketing gimmick. 
---
That said, taking potshots at the bigger competition just makes you look like a geek.
---
Friends are really the only motivating factor in me playing games like Destiny 2 where you do the same content over and over and over and over again. With friends it's fun!
---
So much of that content was just figuring out the mechanics. Knowing where to stand, what specific angle to place your dps at, how many tanks you need, etc. Once those details are figured out, it's much, MUCH simpler. I remember when ZG was first released. Hell, DM north was thought to be tough at first before people realized it was just designed to throw rogues a bone.

Doesn't count. You're horde.
---
You don't need to "quit your relationships" to do something for 6 days.
---
What the fuck? These guys are just facepalming through classic.
---
Like i said sure they are skilled players who have been practicing, but theres not that much skill you need in classic.
---
they just took down Onyxia with 32 players, and did him from 50% to kill with 15 players..
---
Basically facerolled
---
Half the gathering quests in loch modan got to me, but not to the point where I wasn't enjoying myself.

I am also currently on an alt realm from the guild since I am unable to take time off or remote in to beat the ques...

Nice Job. Gratzzz

Based on groups I have had in rfc and wc... The future is grim.

he hides and then adds spawn in the middle of the raid. Much like the last boss of Obsidian Sanctuary.

I'm a career lawyer and I have Mythic Jaina top 100 and Glad both first BFA seasons lol.. you underestimate how much better adults are at these kind of games to be honest.

I would think Druid, but your friends would prob pressure you into healing.
---
Resets in 2 hours; they're gonna get World Second as well
---
no, it takes a few weeks for top guilds to take down a full mythic raid, and thats with very good gear and skill.
---
Everything else worked fine, just the side bars glitch out a lot.
---
Had some dipshit in my deadmines group earlier that left after 1 wipe. Hope he goes back to retail also.
---
Naxx will be pugged. Maybe not full clear at first, but you can pug a good 8-10 bosses no problem, and eventually enough people will have enough gear and experience to carry.
---
That is true for all Vanilla raids up to the later half of AQ.
---
I was solo healing the last phase of Nef without problems back in the day because the other healers died to... something.
---
I dislike Asmon, but to be fair; that hat says 'Make AZEROTH great again'. 
---
He's not a trump supporter AFAIK.
---
What’s up with your debug durations, not working?
---
if you are lower than level 50, DM means deadmines. Else it means dire maul.
---
Most people in retail don't do mythic
---
Why druid? Just out of curiosity. Compared to shaman
---
They played the shit out these raids on private servers and know them inside and out. These raids may as well be starting zone quests to them.

I guess I don't see what you have been. People just playing the game. I do tend to not really pay attention to trade/zone chat.

PLAYED VANILLA FOR 15 YEARS OMEGALUL STILL WIPED TO ONYXIA OMEGALUL
---
It gets more complicated in AQ/BWL when mages have to coordinate rolling ignites.
---
They only had 32/40 players too. and took him from 50% to 0% with only 15 players alive.
---
classic is ez
---
Plenty of people said that MC will take month to clear.
---
Why haven't you idiots on full servers rerolled to less populated servers?
---
Whoa whoa whoa, let's not say inaccurate things here. Monkeynews clearly had three elixirs up for Rag.
---
Did you expect anything different? Classic raiding is not hard... Naxx will be steamrolled on release too.
---
Fuck me for having watched The Producers again this week and being unable to get the songs out my head right?
---
You need those Goretusk Livers?
---
They just downed Onyxia as well.
---
Pure evil
---
Man these people gotta chill
---
The people who tell us to switch servers don't have friends they're playing with. It's the only explanation as to why they don't understand what a nightmare it is to coordinate among a bunch of people. Especially when people already have 20+ hours invested.
---
I'm sure you know more about monetizing events like these than they do. Especially since you're not aware what sponsors are

This are really good opportunities to use macros to combine actions because they are on separate GCDs (or none, in the case of pet commands). If you try to cast two spells at once, the GCD prevents one spell from being cast. So long as none of the casts have conflicting GCDs, you can pile as many as you'd like into one button press.
---
And in all of this you failed to mention how generally shit people were at the game 15 years ago. How bad peoples internet connections were. How hard it was to form a group of 40 people 15 years ago. How bad addons were. How little knowledge of the game people had. How simple the classes were to play. 
---
You cannot even compare the level of difficulty from vanilla raiding to nowadays. The game is literally at its most competitive stage its ever been right now. The very top end players are incredibly skilled at the game, and addons have advanced a lot since 15 years ago. And even then some bosses are extremly difficult even for guilds like method who have access to the best players on the planet. Just look at avatar and kiljaeden in tos last expansion. Those bosses were deemed almost impossible, even with all the tools modern players have along with all the ptr testing. 
---
Imagine if players could PTR test molten core with the addons and skills they have today. The raid would be cleared in less than an hour. The skillgap is just incomparable.
---
&gt; they used to solo onyxia in Vanilla.
---
Pretty sure you're confused about this.  No one was soloing onyxia in vanilla.  The wacky low party member count kills didn't start until BC came out and the crazy stat inflation along with it.
---
As for the rest of your post, not dying isn't a paladin exclusive trait, nor are paladins anywhere near as good at it as you're acting.  They can survive as long as their mana pool lasts which is extended a bit by their heavy armor but other than that, what do they have?  Divine shield is a great cooldown, yes, but 10 seconds is not enough time to escape some particularly bad situations and hearthing away is a ridiculous example of "good solo class" given the potential travel time you just cost yourself.  Outside of that hour cooldown, the only other escape option is "just walk away" which isn't always feasible.  
---
Compare to the actual top tier solo classes mage &amp; hunter.  Hunter can drop all aggro trivially, tank adds with their pet and have decent dps.  Frost mages are masters of kiting and solo kill dozens of mobs by themselves.  It's why a frost mage was the world first level 60 in fact.  
---
Paladin has no option but tanking everything himself and hoping to walk away because killing everything will certainly run him oom and get him killed.
---
Sorry, i repeat my statement that paladin is not a good solo class by any reasonable standard.  Bubble hearthing is a meme, not a combat strategy.
---
Obligatory rouge is a color, rogue is the class
---
I have 48 silver and 63 copper. Level 14. Sweating over what to train.

Hi im 12 and what is this
---
Retail players please defend island expeditions.... yea that's what I thought.
---
Wow. So funny to see the evolution from Vanilla to Classic. Just think on Vanilla release a full party of 60’s geared in epics couldn’t down rag for hundreds of days. Most of these guys aren’t even lvl 60 yet and it took them 5 days haha.
---
took 2 pulls.
---
More resources and information out on the game. Back in the day this stuff wasnt readily available
---
Thank you, Sir!
---
I just hit level 15, does anyone know how long Phase 1 will go on for at all even an estimate?
---
Asmongold has been saying classic raiding is easy and a joke for weeks, maybe your getting down voted because ya know, you.
---
That's a 10 slot bag, there is not a single ball in the  picture, let alone two or three of them.
---
Is the term "Poopsocking" still relevant?
---
That was vanilla, this is classic.
---
You put stupid in, you get stupid out.  What did you expect.
---
Ey Majordomo ese! Why you let these gringos inside mi casa!? You gonna pay maricón!
---
Hitting 60 before Phase 2 isn't really a big deal. All it brings is world bosses and Honor. Phase 3 is the important one and it should be a long ways away.

Ah this is a good thing, as when every raid gets 1 shot in a couple months... there will be literally fucking nothing to do lol

I’m still level 13.

The creators aren't gone? Blizzard still exists. They make games. They're supporting the one you're bitching about now.

There's a lot morally wrong about pirating. It's literally theft. You are stealing the game. Committing a crime.

Wraith awaiting launch orders.
---
when people say vanilla is hard they are talking about the leveling and the world compared to retail in case you didn't understand
---
It doesn't slow though
---
People are way better now plus 1.12 is much easier version with incredibly buffed talents for every spec and double debuff slots on bosses. I'm not sue if any of the bosses were nerfed over the course of vanilla or not. But these other changes are why many of us argued that the bosses and trash should have some buffs (at least hp and damage) to compensate for how much stronger 1.12 characters were but we got shouted down by #nochanges.. With that said, ragnaros would have still went down very quickly but it might have required all 40 hit level 60 at least. The changes more would have effected regular players who MC is still gonna be very simple for because of he class changes. So I imagine just a raid comp of the right number of tanks, healers, and then any DPS should be fine.
---
not really we already know the requirements to open the gates they have nothing but time to grind all the items and put them on alts.  The only thing that may hold them back is building the septar which Im assuming the quest wont be available till the patch drops.
---
It's one subscription Michael, what could it cost? 15 dollars?
---
trash loot
---
Everyone works for it...idiot lol
---
I just posted s comment about this. I remember this being hard as hell even getting there. How did they do it without even being 60
---
agreed, I'm not trying to downplay what they did, but killing the bosses in 1 shot each isnt the impressive part
---

These fights have been nerfed into the ground and most of these players are in gear that is an average of low-50's.  It's 15 year old content that is a VERY far cry from how difficult it was when first introduced.
---
It's great that they had this much time to play the game to level, but that's the reason they were first - not because they beat impossibly hard content nobody else will beat.  Just that they had the first group of experienced raiders leveled to attempt it.
---
Grats on having a lot of time to play and the experience to do the raids right from the start.  Not much skill is involved in grinding levels against braindead UI with the help of layering.  Nothing of note was accomplished here.
---
WoW
---
Nothing to do? Oh so they are all level 60 with all 40 raid members in full Tier 1 sets? How did they manage that in one run?
---
Guess they somehow managed to max their professions, get their epic mounts, get all attunements and rep. I guess we're underplaying the real achievement here, they completed ALL phase 1 classic content in a single MC run!
---
Stay a while, and listen.
---
Ony requires a long attunement. When I did it in vanilla it probably took me longer to do just that chain than it took these 30+ guys to go from level 1 to killing Ony. Like I said in my OP, the amount of negativity around here is pretty shocking to me. Everyone is saying this is easy; I don't think any of you have a clue how hard this is.
---
I’m sorry but y’all are fucking losers
---
You can report them! Just whisper them and then you can click on their name in the chat window and report them! Figured this out yesterday and have reported every single chat invite. Hopefully blizzard gets them off the game
---
Private servers make the raids more difficult by changing things. Classic is such a easy game it's insane. It's not hard, just time consuming. Bad game design
---
I said in a post before but ppl don't realize apes is filled with pretty much a all-star line up. If they are not world first kind of over ppl they are highly skilled pvp players. So they will be rather good at the other. This is not shocking they are steam rolling classic
---
well difficult for their experience ?
---
Naxx in 2006 could feel much more difficult than any raid in 2019
---
To be fair, having multiple parts of the same quest chain having the same name was pretty dumb.
---
I don't care how you play. Some of us have lives, others do not.
---
You make a VERY GOOD point
---
But for us priests is Mind Flay or bust and im going mostly healing
---
I swear, if people start complaining about a lack of content ..
---
Whats the deal with the 10 mans anyway. Thought xp would be very low in that setting? or does the speed make up for it?
---
The best part are all the salty streamers and players, who said that guildsike method will easily win these races. Congratulations to apes.
---
All this sounds oddly familiar...
---
&gt;Now, everyone begins as a poor player—it takes time to learn a game to get to a point where you know what you’re doing. There is the mistaken notion, though, that by merely continuing to play or “learn” the game, one can become a top player. In reality, the “scrub” has many more mental obstacles to overcome than anything actually going on during the game. The scrub has lost the game even before it starts. He’s lost the game even before deciding which game to play. His problem? He does not play to win.
---
&gt;The scrub would take great issue with this statement for he usually believes that he is playing to win, but he is bound up by an intricate construct of fictitious rules that prevents him from ever truly competing. These made-up rules vary from game to game, of course, but their character remains constant. Let’s take a fighting game off of which I’ve made my gaming career: Street Fighter.
---
&gt;In Street Fighter, the scrub labels a wide variety of tactics and situations “cheap.” This “cheapness” is truly the mantra of the scrub. Performing a throw on someone is often called cheap. A throw is a special kind of move that grabs an opponent and damages him, even when the opponent is defending against all other kinds of attacks. The entire purpose of the throw is to be able to damage an opponent who sits and blocks and doesn’t attack. As far as the game is concerned, throwing is an integral part of the design—it’s meant to be there—yet the scrub has constructed his own set of principles in his mind that state he should be totally impervious to all attacks while blocking. The scrub thinks of blocking as a kind of magic shield that will protect him indefinitely. Why? Exploring the reasoning is futile since the notion is ridiculous from the start.
---
&gt;You will not see a classic scrub throw his opponent five times in a row. But why not? What if doing so is strategically the sequence of moves that optimizes his chances of winning? Here we’ve encountered our first clash: the scrub is only willing to play to win within his own made-up mental set of rules. These rules can be staggeringly arbitrary. If you beat a scrub by throwing projectile attacks at him, keeping your distance and preventing him from getting near you—that’s cheap. If you throw him repeatedly, that’s cheap, too. We’ve covered that one. If you block for fifty seconds doing no moves, that’s cheap. Nearly anything you do that ends up making you win is a prime candidate for being called cheap. Street Fighter was just one example; I could have picked any competitive game at all.
---
If you’d unsubscribe because blizzard won’t free transfer your level 15 mage you won’t make it to 60. The game is too tedious for a diva to get through.
---
People think Dark Souls is difficult but you can clear the entire series without taking a single hit, people think Getting Over It is frustrating but you can clear it in under 2 minutes, there is no such thing as a difficult game with this logic.
---
Of course.  Half the difficulty of original Naxx was learning the fights.  It took the top guilds in the world something like 6 weeks to figure out they needed 8 main tanks for 4h.
---
It seems obvious in retrospect now, but before WoW all the previous MMO raidbosses were tank and spank for the most part.  I played EQ for a bit and only participated in a few raids, but I can only recall one or two that had mechanics different from setting up CH rotations on the MT and everyone else nuking down the boss and adds.  One of WoW’s original design philosophies were designing fights inspired by Zelda bossfights, AKA with lots of movement and different mechanics you had to exploit (and even those didn’t really exist until Ony and BWL).  People were still learning basic things like “don’t stand in the fire”.
---
It only looks easy now because we have had 15 years of experience learning the fights, and have deadly boss mods to help the casuals faceroll through some of the fights.
---
Besides, using the top guilds in the world as a litmus test for how easy/hard classic really was is a poor measurement.  In the original release, only something like 60ish guilds ever beat Naxx.  It will be interesting to see what percentage of the playerbase is able to defeat Kel’thuzad this time around.
---
Yeah I did that quest, got taunt and figured the rest would come later
---
With spawn rates jacked way up right now it's a bit easier.  I hope they make it more difficult so it's an epic experience and not something that's just done on day 1.
---
Shaman is nice because not only are you not competing for drops, but you can buff your buddies with totems and heal them too, all while doing some decent damage yourself
---
Most of the arguments were over whether it would take 1 week or 2 weeks to do.
---
Admittedly, I was wrong and thought 2.
---
I must say as a former player I’m shocked and disappointed. 
---
I always kinda expected the bosses to be easier than they were made out to be. People are just so used to following performances to kill bosses. Back in the days people were just to easily overwhelmed. 
---
But all that aside, the run to 60 and then killing those legendary bosses in under a week makes classic seem just like all the other expansions. Which is obviously sad
---
Mn used one major healing potion. His only one.
---
There's no method guild in classic, just 2 (3?) guys playing for fun.
---
God damnit loch ness monster!

Here's the thing. If I was playing on US servers I'd argue that yet, clickers are bad and people are being ass holes. But if I was playing on US servers, I would of also had the option to pick a server I knew wasn't going to be as crowded.
---
I'm playing on Aragul, which was the only Oceanic PvP server that was available on launch, so I didn't have an option. So I'm basically trying to counter act Blizzards lack of foresight. I'd also argue that the average person using a clicker would be more dedicated to the extended longevity and health of Classic servers than those who wouldn't, so think of it as a benefit. If you're someone who is complaining about clicker AFKers but then quits playing before even hitting level 60, well then I don't care about your opinion.
---
There will always be bad players.
---
When warlocks bitch about not being sble to mount because they are oom or locked out of shadow school
---
I will wait until a regular guild clear MC and Onyxia. APES is just on a different level in term of experience and skill. Even professional guild like Method aren't even close to touching MC (maybe in week 2).
---
According to Monkeynews the instance farming is pretty much broken. Supposedly they hadn't really planned to go instance farming initially, or at least didn't have any specific routes/approaches in mind. After figuring out just how to maximise the speed while doing so, he said they should be able to beat Jokerd's time using it.
---
Haha this is gold
---
Your question doesn't really fit well as a response to what I wrote there, as I wasn't talking about myself and already explained why those guys weren't very excited, so not sure what you want me to say here. Everyone has their own reason to play and ways to have fun, thinking there is an "exact point" to why one should play Classic is a strange way to think. This video was showcased because it was the first rag kill in the official new Classic release. It doesn't mean they need to scream their heads off after not sleeping much for 5 days and killing a boss they've killed 200+ times.
---
&gt; Excuse me while I go raid SM with 6 mages in a 10-man group and aoe down all of cath in 1 pull.
---
Because a hardcore raiding guild with over 200 rag kills on private servers managed to get world first in the first week, the games gonna be dead in 3 months?
---
Hi, /u/Veebi

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cy61gt/casual_gnome_moment_at_the_wetlands/). 
---
'No way private server guilds can get world firsts when they have real competitions' was my favorite take.
---
You know you're sitting at a machine capable of browsing reddit, yeah?
---
This would be absolutely wonderful but classic is a cash grab. They didn't have to do much work. Just open some servers and put old wow on them.
---
You may as well just bring a Holy paladin as they have more utility and if speced right do more damage than a Ret and can still heal way better.
---
NA WOW LUL
---
I had forgotten the feeling of getting ganked by bears. Best rush of adrenaline, even if I die.
---
&gt; Do they have power for laptops to plug into? 
---
Some do, although you may run into amperage issues.
---
People are way better now plus 1.12 is much easier version with incredibly buffed talents for every spec and double debuff slots on bosses. I'm not sue if any of the bosses were nerfed directly over the course of vanilla or not. But these other changes are why many of us argued that the bosses and trash should have some buffs (at least hp and damage) to compensate for how much stronger 1.12 characters were but we got shouted down by #nochanges when #nochanges should have focused on the spirit of classic, of which tackling Molten Core at this power level is not.   
---
With that said, Ragnaros would have still went down very quickly but it might have required all 40 hit level 60 at least. The changes more would have effected regular players who are still gonna find MC to be very simple.   
---
At the very least, any raid comp will work. So I imagine just a raid comp of the right number of tanks, healers, and then any DPS should be fine for almost anything.
---
Can't argue that one lol.
---
enchanting is far from cheap, but engineering is awful to level, too. I'd level mining with tailoring and then at 60 level engineering, or you'll never have the money for a mount at 40, because you'll be wrapping up all your gold into your professions. :(
---
not to you personally, fusion, but to the op, who isn't decided yet. DEing gear and using it to do lousy enchants on your gear over and over and over is a huge loss of gold when you could just sell those pieces (many of which vendor for 30s+ each, especially once you're level 30 and that just kind of becomes the normal vendor prices for quest rewards. or more! got a couple 80s/ea weapons a rewards today, and had to make that hard call to DE them or not.
---
my leveling bud who went double gathering professions is doing way better in money than i am, and i'm being HELLA frugal with spells. i'm definitely not gonna have gold for a mount at 40.
---
That’s the first thing I thought about when I saw it. Lmao. I lived in Florida for 16+ years and went through many hurricanes that knocked out power for over 2 weeks one time  (which knocks out water for well people which is a lot) and had to shit in a bucket quite a bit 😂😂
---
Report them to blizzard
---
Or level up your paladin!
---
Does anyone actually think the Method race to World First was serious?
---
I much rather look around me and watch the beautiful world of Azeroth. No need to stay busy all the time while playing, you can just sit back and relax
---
I misread the second part of your comment but either way I wouldn’t say he’s a nobody in terms of speedrunners for classic.
---
I'm not convinced the ping mattered at all. WoW just isn't a ping intensive game, especially not in PVE.
---
The boss is usually dead within the first week or two of mythic being released. The only reason why end bosses take long is because of the gear check that usually goes with them.
---
You're comparing a brand new raid boss with new mechanics that no one has seen before to a raid that has been out for 15 years now and this guild has literally cleared it several hundred times on multiple private servers.
---
Right click report
---
Do you think the group of level 50-somethings that killed rag here had a bunch of + healing gear then?
---
wrong lol, i've been playing private servers for years and I still die a lot in classic, and I'm also an occasional mythic raider on retail
---
Who needs a transmog when you can show off that smokin body, smh
---
BY FIRE BE PURGED
---
What do you mean,  i tohught you said NA will open few hours sooner , so potentially they have lets say +6hours for nothing just because? I am not in competitive and based in oceanic i just don't see how EU would not be claimed as winners if they kill some Boss  faster than the time frame that NA did. If its not available for them how can they be in the competition as 2nd. I wonder why ppl would see it different
---
As I remember (its been since raiding MC in vanilla) you had to start casting it right away in order for it to work. But it was definitively possible and quite fun.
---
As always it's people overreacting simply to cause drama. I mean, come on. People on here were accusing the Method streamers of freaking account sharing for having someone in ther studio press space bar in order for them not to get booted ingame while the streamers are afk or sleeping. While the latter is more of a dickish move to those in queues it is more than understandable. I wanna bet most if not all on this sub would do the same had they the possibility of someone keeping them from getting booted out of the game.
---
Heck, even now as both Onyxia and MC have fallen people are claiming Method has been shifting goal posts from reaching level 60 first over to killing MC and Ony despite announced the race as a combination of these  three from the start of the announcement of the event.
---
I bet there will be mass free transfer before the release of Phase 2, but not before that. Which will be at least 3 months from now.
---
These are the hardcore players it's not everyone that will be running through this lol.  Just because ultimate guilds do it and have been playing together forever without lives doesnt mean anything. It has been a raid people have known for years  now they didnt forget how to do it.
---
The game literally has a journal in the UI that tells you the mechanics, the damage numbers, what to look out for, if its a heroic/mythic only ability, etc.  The element of mystery with literally just pulling and seeing what the hell happens and having zero clue what to expect is long gone, and I find that sad.  Don't get me wrong, obviously that is gone from Classic as well, but why should that be gone for brand spanking new bosses in current WoW expansions?
---
Not to mention Method literally tests new raids on the PTR and has a solid strat lined up before its even live.  The only impressive thing about a Method world first these days is how much gold they borrow and blast through for consumables.  I'm no longer impressed by a group that is paid to play the game 24/7.  Call it gatekeeping or something, but it was a lot more impressive to me when it was a bunch of basement nerds and normal people who just blasted their entire years vacation time for a new raid release and it was make or break in that first 1-2 weeks.
---
Very easy coast biased timings there. Latest time range is only 5:15pm.
---
I don’t understand. How could retail improve without first pinpointing what went wrong? BFA has been objectively faring worse than any expansion so far. Do they not want retail to be better? I certainly do, and that’s why I make comparisons to classic.
---
Tarren Mill Yeti farming quest will make you give up on it... I farmed for 2 hours for a quest item, but the pro is you can lvl skinning and LW while farming.
---
Still kinda pointless using exploiting layering at all in the speedrun aspect of it, even if he only used at last bit if you were to break it into categories it would be
---
WR: 60 (Layering)
---
Once layering gets removed would be interesting to see if anyone could top the time, would also be interesting to see just how fast people could push the layering while it lasts.
---
Lol for what? World isn't an official channel, it's one someone creates and then the leader gets passed down to whoever is online next. This happened back then and people warned that it would happen now too.
---
How did they get attuned already?
---
Really?? I feel like I’ve been taking my time, herbalism, fishing, skinning and first aid around 150 and I’m lvl 24 with 27 hours
---
Wow those are some ugly women
---
Why is it always the horde who use the most childish taunt
---
Many guilds stilled were wiping to baron and shaz in the pserver scene. These guys make it look easy. Though it is quite easy if you know how to handle it, but there will be a large majority of players that don’t clear raids in the gear that APES did and will still struggle in certain places even with prebis
---
I don't understand the "no changes" movement because the game is significantly different now than it was during "phase one" of classic.
---
I can only assume that the people who wants no changes are not happy (due to the fact that it's significantly different), and that the people who wanted some changes are not happy (due to the fact that the raids are vastly undertuned)
---
Oh, I didn't realize they weren't going for any world firsts. I guess I got confused by their stream titles saying, "going for world first 1-60"...
---
“Yeah I got so desperate when you stopped playing.. I tried it with the fuckin panda!”
---
Anyone that raided in Wotlk, or did even one heroic dungeon in TBC can handle MC without a problem. Naxx or AQ were about the only difficult ones.
---
but only when the mob is at 5% health
---
I watched a vid of someone from method talking shit. He said they had looked at all the guilds from the private servers and said they didn't stand a chance against method.
---
Don't you name all the dungeons you do after the boss?
---
/s
---
I don’t get it either. I grew up on vanilla... it was my obsession. I have no interest in it at all.
---
Everyone has their own unique draw into classic WoW. Some people can't wait for the unbalanced PvP. Others can't wait for the Sunday fishing tournaments. Perhaps the draw of professions still the  a meaningful impact (Engineering!!). Everyone will have a unique journey based on their in-game focus. An experience tailored to your priorities. 
---
If hitting level cap, getting your pre-raid BiS, finding a raiding guild and experiencing 40 man raid content appeals to you, more power to you. Maybe you won't even level a character all the way to 60, there's no shame in that whatsoever. Personally I plan on attempting to experience the full gambit of what classic has to offer. I never thought I'd do it, but I plan on leveling a Druid to tank dungeons for endgame content. Something about knowing that druids aren't the best tank/healers/DPS allows me to have more fun with the character. Liberating not to need to be top of the DPS, healing, or threat meter for raids (if I choose to pursue raiding)
---
I played on an RP realm because that's where all my friends were in vanilla. We were high schoolers then and thought role players were to be "tolerated" but that doesn't mean we didn't crash a few ceremonies. This time around I'll be playing on an RP/PvP server and really developing the story of my character. 
---
The main thing here is to not let anyone other than yourself determine your trajectory through Azeroth. Get lost in world PvP. Spend hours leveling your professions. Wander out to the barrens to troll or be trolled. Help a stranger. The options are only limited by your imagination. Just make it yours! Don't become so obsessed with whatever your endgame objectives are you forget to stop and smell the fade leaf along the way.
---
Well it’s my main. And it’s my OG name because I started day one and reserved the name Doom, held it for 4 years until WotLK when I server transferred. Classic was the only way I’d ever experience getting that name again, and a crucial point in my nostalgia I was looking for. So considering I got it, on two servers. I’m not giving it up, for any amount of gold.
---
I'd love that
---
That’s the definition of no lifing. If you did that then you are no lifing, like what are you even saying
---
im new to wow so sorry for being stupid but, you need more than 25 people to do a raid? hell i thought 6 people in destiny is hard to get. how the hell do you get that many people?
---
Well tbh, if you talent into the 10% less resistance and you are the same level as them the chances of it happening are like super low. But in the case it does happen I would reset. However, in the weird occasion that you maybe can’t be screwed to reset, you can always just poly the one that resists and then start the same rotation as normal
---
I don't get it, got greater wand, in redridge level 18 and everyone just kills things faster than me, wtf
---
Fire isn’t “bad” it’s more for experienced players who know how to manage kites and mana well, with frost you will die less and have an easier time learning the game and how to kite and keep things away. Fire has much less CC making you have to really be more experienced to know how to execute it well is just the thing, if that makes sense, if you are dying a lot, I would recommend to stick with frost and you’ll have a much better time.
---
Have you even played retail? The AH is booming on any server thats not low pop
---
Dark Souls Speedrunners like Elajjaz have close to 10 000 hours in that game alone.  
---
These guys are just Speedrunners.  
---
Fast to 60 and clearing the content as fast as possible.  
---
People want to beat Personal Times and get the Records.  
---
That first to 60 guy will delete his character and start over because he mainly enjoys leveling fast and nothing else.  
---
The same with people that play 10000 ranked games in any Multiplayer PvP Game and so on even though its always the same shit.
---
Everyone enjoys different things and has different goals.
---
You're right. It really is just a coincidence. High turn-over rates are common in tech and gaming. That they stayed as long as they did makes them outliers.
---
Get Questie
---
I would rather blizzard does not change roll out cycle for the 1% of no lifers
---
It’s 100% a character that he overacts and plays up. The draw for him is he is good at keeping his viewers engaged and giving them something to root for or against.
---
When he is behaving like you mention, absurd narcissistic behavior, it gives his audience something to laugh at and ridicule. Some people buy in to it and think that he’s being serious, but for the most part his regular viewers are all in on the joke. 
---
I think the misconceptions come from him being very good at keeping a straight face through all of that. There are times where he breaks character and has real talk about things, but for the most part it’s all straight-faced sarcasm.
---
My man
---
&gt; That's not an argument against the fact that Vanilla is objectively a snooze-fest when it comes to endgame challenge. Not tweaking the difficulty of these raids is essentially delivering an unVanilla-like experience.
---
The vanilla experience *was* a snooze-fest.
---
Shit, anyone who was really pushing raid progression in vanilla probably remembers how incredibly boring MC/BWL got once everyone was just auto-piloting it.
---
The vanilla experience *was* boring.  We just skipped the clueless and bad phase.  The bosses being harder wouldn't make us all forget how to beat them.
---
this is what i thought vanilla would be and im woefully mistaken. its more along the lines of
---
*Kill 3000 bears because for some reason 2990 of them dont have kidneys. Start that quest in barrens, turn it in to thunderbluff, which you dont have a flight path for...and then realize theres no quest chain and OVERALL i just wasted my time by doing this lo.
---
Theres almost no logical flow to any of this game. 
---
And also class design is bad as shit im already a mid 20's hunter and i virtually have every spell in the game thats relevant to my rotation.....
---
EVEN better is when items are placed for lower than the AH deposit price. I know that comes back but damn
---
High pops are pretty packed just without a queue time.
---
Congrats
---
Not a European thing. It's definitely always been rag
---
So basically how it worked on PvP servers as well with game masters and tickets.
---
Pmed you
---
Let me know what guild has accomplished more than method
---
Or they can see the pros and cons of each, and are adults with the ability to choose how they spend their time.
---
I enjoy retail because it has a better endgame, better mechanics, better balance and ability rotation.
---
I enjoy classic for completely different reasons but I'm still happy to invest months of my time in classic. There's a lot of game outside those things I listed and I'm enjoying it immensely.
---
You're making up your own argument that nobody is reciprocating on this sub, it's kind of weird.
---
Or to pigeonhole himself into a single game for the rest of his career... He's not that old and still has a long career ahead of him, if he stayed attached to WoW for too much longer it might have been harder to find something else.
---
No they did it late too.  You pretty much do 1-30 doing quests.  At 30 you got SM, you grind that shit into the ground until you're 40-45.  Then you go ZF, and you grind that til like 49-54.  Then you go LBRS at 54 until 58, then BRD for the necessary gear and a little bit of rep.
---
The rep only needed to be done on a few people, so they had them grind out to 60ish in silithus.  Any good BOE gear was sent to their tanks and healers.
---
It was an extremely well designed grind and the fact that 25 people could coordinate to make that happen is impressive.
---
Pretty sure it’s on 1.12 which was the patch after naxx (prior to TBC obviously)
---
please tell me that you are aware they aren't just good but that ragnaros is a compelte joke by today's standards ?
---
Joining groups to jump phased servers. Kill all mobs in one area, join group on different layer to kill same mobs without waiting for spawn.
---
It's the same every expansion in retail, hardcore top-tier guilds clear mythic raids quickly and everyone goes "this game is so fucking easy now" - meanwhile they haven't even cleared content on LFR or Normal difficulty.
---

---
Definitely reccomend it, though I've started a queue in the morning before work and was still in it after I got home twice now, lol.
---
doesn't mean the hard content isn't there.
---
You can't call it bad game design, the game is 15 years old at this point and has been figured out and mastered by private server players.
---
Even better.
---
Yeah serious adult jobs like running a videogame mafia
---
Commenting for later
---
Yes, I am hungarian, everyone calls it Ragna
---
All you gotta do is hit 60 and people will be swarming Ony.
---
You're a very good troll.
---
Those with patience are rewarded most, brother.
---
well when you've done it on pservers 100+ times, yea its probably pretty easy
---
because almost no one has CC lol, hunter CC you cant use in combat so good fucking luck ever wasting the 30 extra seconds planning to swing pull a specific mob into a trap.
---
Half the mobs in dungeons have broken aggro ranges so fearing is a dog shit idea.
---
Go back to "so you think you can dance"
---
Not really.  They grinded BRD to 60 on the majority of their players and there were plenty of good blues and some epics on their DPS.
---
Are you and I playing in close proximity, or are you fantasizing about this scenario?
---
I said expected.  All they can do now is try their best for whatever they can get.  Classic is a lot tougher though so I don’t blame them for taking their time.
---
and now Onyxia
---
How bout no draenei
---
While Blizzard hasn't made an official statement, there's no way they're going to base the phase length of any phase based only on how quickly the very first raid group clears something.
---
My suspicion is that phase 1 will last 2-3 months, as that's about how long it will take a lot of players to reach level cap.
---
32 people, not all being 60 wearing quest greens and blues.
---
Classic raids are simplistic and easy.
---
Perhaps, but anyone who has raided mythic on retail will find the levels of coordination and complexity of mechanics of vanilla raiding to be trivial.
---
Vanilla raiding isn't mechanically difficult.  A lot of the difficulty comes from sheer numbers and logistics.  A lot of bosses act as gear checks even though they're simplistic in nature.
---
Is it really 5%? That seems incredibly high for how often it shows up
---
Raids on PS are mostly buffed because they'd be way too easy otherwise.
---
Disable all addons and try again
---
Can’t you just do the Durotar quests? Would take like two hours tops.
---
Rip method haha , and ppl said the retail raiding guilds would destroy the classic nerds hahah
---
I think you hit the nail on the head about what made Wow great when it was originally realeased. Thinking back about what I loved about wow was the people. The game was tedious as shit and many, MANY hours were spent on the local chat or wandering around to get help or pick up groups. When youre waiting for a group to gather you chat with people and generally piss around which was great fun. The game itself atleast in its original run was decent but not great, the end game portion was however very epic and 40 man raids were great fun but also a bundle of chaos. Again you would wait around for people to show up and for the guild leader to organize the mess that constitutes a 40 man raid.
---
I already did 2 Arra'Cheas, first helping a random (the entire thing lasted like an hour and half), and then getting help from a random when it was my time to do it!
---
The first ten levels are brutal. The next ten levels are a little better. The forty after that are awesome.
---
I’m excited too. There are literally dozens of us that are excited!
---
Plenty of Amish and Luddite communities if you want to unplug friend.
---
that's their epic mount
---
is SUF available for classic? i might break my no-addons rule
---
Ty
---
Knowing how a mechanic work is entirely different than strategizing to counter it, that’s the hard part.
---
Let me guess you don't think this is really classic wow and Blizz purposely made the game easy to attract the casuals.
---
Boar meat has been selling for like 2s each. 
---
Easily get a few gold in an hour that way. The black boars to the south in the nooby area are 100% drop rate in durotar
---
Ye, it's like that in classic too
---
Does anyone from Grizzly stream?
---
Seems like the definition of a circular argument to me. It is less difficult because they did it, because it is less difficult!
---
I mean people went to classic because of retail community. Is it really hard to believe it wouldn't go the other way? This game has been out for all of a week and I'm already fatigued from the barrage of ReTAiL OMEGALUL in reddit, general chat, trade chat, etc. It just sucks the life out of the game. I play classic because I want to play classic not because I want to hear people trashing retail.
---
It's not hard, but it's not easy. There is some difficulty
---
Thats the plot of a movie not real life.
---
I avoid all this but typing out deadmines lol
---
I did a quest at the crossroads, get 7 beaks from birds, took me an hour but I'm still gonna play lmao
---
Weird.. This killed the world first hype for me.
---
No joy, no team spirit, no achievement, no screaming..
---
Monkeynews was going on about how if you want to play a meme spec then you should be treated like you're playing a meme spec, meanwhile they do MC with level 50s and in greens and do Onyxia with less than 40 people.
---
I cant possibly recommend people load up the PVP henhouse private server and try to get a feel of classes when they are almost fully geared at 60, youll quickly realize that id almost say the majority of specs are unplayably bad and disadvanced. -
---
both are half correct
---
Stupidest shit I’ve ever seen, waits 3 years for classic and pre much finishes the game in 4 days
---
Got 13 friends irl on my server with me - we all had 12 hour queues on launch day so decided to reroll on a high pop server. We never haves queues and it’s amazing. I even got another friend to reroll after 1 day /played on the full server. He said he regrets not rerolling earlier because now he actually gets to play.
---
Who cares about power leveling, a very small part of the community will actually do it, and the rest of us are questing, which layering makes that even at all possible.
---
If people didn’t look every facet of the game up before experiencing it themselves and figuring it out the raids could be a lot more enjoyable to overcome.
---
Can you still do this or is it broken? I want to have it for PvE
---
There is no classic realm called silvermoon... That's a retail realm.  EU has one. Not sure if USA has one.
---
Nah the most important debuffs are in the first 8 already
---
Most of the last 6/8 are msotly fillers like corruption or shadow word pain
---
Lol is this what we're doing now
---
Method is a WoW guild that turned into a successful business spanning different e-sports and orgs. I understand that in this context they represent retail and people here get really upset about retail but you're basically making fun of a commercial that exists to promote their brand.
---
Who give a shit what they do, you do you and keep having fun
---
lolol
---
Yeah dude this is fucking insane! Super cool to see it happen.
---
Accurate
---
They are a pretty quiet guild, they let their gameplay do the talking.
---
Dude the goalposts have legs, they just keep moving all over the place!
---
They’re not doing it for you, buddy
---
What’s the point of your comment?
---
I mean deathwing caused a big mess that still exists. Bfa has bronze dragons to see you the world before the undead queen went mini-deathwing over two cities.
---
I mean a vast majority of BFA raids are bested in little over a week from their release, does that make htem equally mindless?
---
i thought it was funny
---
Amphy at least has been, he was in contention for wf 60 for a bit but faded around 52.
---
To be fair, it's pretty close. We likely won't see any other clears before the reset.
---
exactly. and that questing actually is part of the game. in retail, the levelling/questing is just streamlined to hold your hand all the way till endgame
---
Actually a good idea. Blizzard just hits the random button and you get the first one that pops up and you can’t change it
---
I can confirm that it's not a private server thing, everyone calls him rag
---
Don’t think about it, most players aren’t even level 25 yet.
---
The people who did this have been grinding there ass off since launch barely logging off, this is not the norm so don’t be worried. Focus on your game.
---

Not to nitpick but aren't only like 5 streamers from method playing? Who is their 'real competition' supposed to be in this scenario?
---
if that is the case their gameplay is telling me how not good i am :/
---
Did it get nerfed along the way? I was in a decent raiding guild back then and on our server i think just one guild manage to clear Naxx and we never managed to go past 4horsemen
---
You can 5 man Onyxia later on lol
---
Here's the thing that everyone fails to mention: this guild is seriously hardcore... They practiced these raids hundreds of times on private servers until they could do perfect runs easily. They spent over 80 hours non stop playing (barely even sleeping) in order to achieve this.
---
This is isn't a normal guild. This guild was pretty much made for this. I can absolutely guarantee you that most guilds will struggle with raids. Jjst look at your average dungeon rn; people are still wiping plenty of times in low level dungeons.
---
it reminds me of how not that good i am :/
---
How are there that many people already 60 and geared enough to do this, that fast?
---
But private servers were much harder so we'll have to see how casual guilds perform on classic
---
Where are people saying its offensive? Can you show me an example?
---
Your shitting me right? 
---
They didn’t literal YEARS play time on private servers stayed up for 5 days straight and coordinated that with at LEAST 40 different people. 
---
And your just sitting here like “lol well that was easy” 
---
Are you daft?
---
Thank you liberal nutcrackers, someone needs to go live in his safe space.
---
Sure, when you are enjoying it yourself but not when you are trying to impose for other people to do it
---
idk he keeps picking fights and then immediately starts falling on his face because of bizarre semantic arguments.
---
Says a lot about me haha, substance abuse runs in the family and I cant help but run to substances.
---
I was so happy to see the old models rather than the new ones. I'll always remember running into Dolanaar the first time and the ground shaking as these guys walked past.
---
You really should stop letting no lifers who treat WoW like a job and have everything down to a science dictate how you think of or experience the content. These guys have been doing this stuff on private servers for years. The vast majority of players are not going to be clearing it anywhere near this fast and they shouldn’t care about todays events.
---
I played about 8 hours a day for the first few days and got three characters into their teens.  We all have different goals, mine is making one of everything on both factions and getting them to 60 and in full T0/D1 sets.  It might take me ten years but that's what I enjoy the most in the game.
---
The new one looks like plastic like everything else in the game.
---
They've beaten Onyxia now too, so...
---
Uh...hmm.
---
You have a moonkin form in your bag?
---
Legit just changed my graphics from 3 to 10. Hasn't even thought about it, because the game is so old. Didn't even mind playing on 3. It almost feels better than 10...
---
Your point is that you're salty?
---
I feel like that's my point.
---
oh ok, i've seen his stream, didn't know he was Grizzly. TY
---
They nerfed the adds mana burn range/health as well as the number that spawned. They nerfed the movespeed as well as the resistance of the adds. They nerfed the damage of rag. They pretty much nerfed every aspect of the fight.
---
The guild I was in got him to around 30% he was beatable but it was a different situation. The fight was at minimum a four cycle fight and if any adds got in to mana burn it was an instant wipe. We had spreadsheets and spreadsheets of mana-pot timings as well as resting periods for everyone's mana which you didn't need due to the talents changes/fight duration.
---
The guild I was in had outside resources farming mana pots as well as flasks so consumables wern't a factor.
---
After the nerf my guild brought in melee dps and two cycled him in one shot.
---
I'm not saying he was "unbeatable" but it was a completely different fight to what people are claiming is a joke now.
---
That article is such fucking tripe holy shit. Did you actually read it? I'm thinking you didn't.
---
One detail I see a lot of people missing is that the old raids were two fold in their difficulty
---
1) we were learning the raid just like anyone else
---
2) and to add we were all also learning the actual mechanics of wow, where a modern raid all of those mechanics are pretty much the same with subtle variation and some nifty hooks here or there.
---
I'm using an overclocked 6100 and a 7870 pushing out 100fps on graphics 6-7, WAY overestimated
---
Was this possible in vanilla?
---
MC/BWL were *significantly* simpler than even AQ/Nax, which were both way easier than TBC's raids
---
I'll call it now.  Every raid from here out will be cleared within 8 hours of release.
---
The point of min/maxing is to reduce raid time, not make it possible to kill. Bad guilds spend 4+ hours a week in molten core. Good guilds clear it in under two (even as low as 30-40m eventually)
---
After seeing the servers on Tuesday and Wednesday, I figured the kill would get pushed back either to late first week, or just after reset, but I guess they didn't log out.
---
Yes. Won't stop people from denying moonkins or elemental shamans raid spots though.
---
Retail normals might be challenging if you don't understand how to read an icyveins page or have the reaction time of a coma patient. As long as your raid isn't full of 50% parsers you should have no problem clearing them. Unfortunately, the majority of players on retail *are* the ones that lack the knowledge and skill to play their class correctly.
---
People shouldn't look only at the popular guys like Method  
---
They are a retail guild with no competition there these days.  
---
No one of these guys that go to Twitch and look at who is popular had someone like APES on the radar.  
---
Even on here people believed Method,Asmongold and Tipsout are the best and fastest players simply because they are the most vocal ones.  
---
The Guild of AlkaizerX had 60s too shortly after the WorldFirst 60s and started doing attunements and if they would have pushed could have been in MC too already.
---
They by far didn't went that hard but leveled smart and efficient.  
---
In the end its about dedication and Classic is loved by hardcore players that can go a week without sleep.  
---
There was always more unknown competition for these "big guys" because Classic is actually fun unlike Retail WoW.
---
its hard not too though. like truth is i feel like i am at best average which is nothing speical or amazing or awesome or anything :/
---
Friend game is the real end game :)
---
The whole "Method got owned" narrative, is like a bunch of people dunking on Real Madrid because Usain Bolt won the gold medal in the 100m sprint. It's just weird to me people are blatantly ignoring, or not understanding, that Method didn't even compete for the world first. 
---
If people instead would give them shit for trying to cash in the classic hype, even though the whole Method event feels kind of forced, I'm all for it. Having commentators for a bunch of people grinding SM, or trying to get 10 boar asses for their quest is awkward. Just get the facts straight when giving them shit.  It feels like half the subreddit is saying 2+2 =5
---
Play 20 hours a day.
---
People have been playing classic on private servers this entire time
---
I remember around a year ago before this sub exploded people were assuming blizz would retune the fights a bit because of 1.12 making things even more of a joke.
---
They were never hard to begin with, but this is just hilarious.  It really puts into perspective why Pservers tend to buff all the bosses.  But #nochanges* happened and here we are lmao.
---
*Some changes were still made to keep the "feel" of classic, and boss tuning was expected to be one to account for balance changes over the life cycle of the game trivializing bosses from when they were current.
---
I had some quests where I had to have killed thirty mobs for five drops. Got annoying but at the same time I've never minded grinding mobs. More so I hate the running courier ones.
---
Some of you guys get a weird hate boner with method. They just play the game like all of us. What's the deal? That they dominate raids on retail or what?
---
But all of this has been done already in the past when WoW actually released. I don't think it counts as world first but maybe something else.
---
truth is a part of me wishes i was good enough to be that hardcore to be a part of that :/
---
10 hours after hitting 60? lol. classic raiding is hilariously easy, there is no denying it.
---
I’m not a phone, you’re a phone.
---
I mean the new content isn't that different from the old stuff.  It's a bit more interesting and nuanced at least, but people are still completing raids in little more than a week.
---
How much are you gonna be pushing the goalpost? Next week most hardcore guilds will have cleared MC. By the 4th week? The average invested player will also have it on farm.
---
also side note idk how dungeons are going yet i have yet to do one yet.
---
I agree. It basically means there is no endgame worth mentioning for a while. Even in a good guild it's not that much fun raiding easy content and it'll feel like a chore to do so.
---
Yeah I figured I'd give it a shot because I couldn't reserve it on Sulfuras but I had gotten it on Kromcrush.
---
They were 34 people. Not everyone was 60. OP is just bitter
---
All those 3 still hold true
---
Community is much better on classic, the leveling and the world is much harder than retail, the world still feels filled with wonders
---
They also killed Onyxia. They basically cleared phase 1 in 1 week.
---
These bosses were all one shots.The raid its self didn't take a week pretty weak comparison.
---
Why would you ever want to do that? They barely even played the game, they just grinded mobs and deprived themselves of sleep, probably damaging their longterm health. They didn't enjoy the game in the slightest
---
So have I but thats not due to difficulty. Thats more because of a lack of mechanics, resources, and absolutely abysmal level design and aggro pull radius's. Im not dying because I made bad decisions Im dying because the alternative to playing risky is taking 3.4 hours to meticulously pull a centaur.
---
Happened to me today. Just started playing lost as hell and saw some dude killing arra asked for invite hit it once and completed my quest. I think I was in about 4 different parties in about an hour just to do quests
---
Playing it now, 14 years later, and having played a lot of MMO’s since, I can honestly say that Classic’s gameplay is actually better than any of them. Only Guild Wars 2 came close in complexity and depth for me.
---
Many games look better. Many have better features, cool social systems like housing, and so on. But Classic is actually the better *game*, and its clunky individual systems all jell into something that necessitate communication and dialogue, and encourages the creation of communities like few other games since.
---
I was prepared to be disappointed once the original nostalgia goggles ran out, but the more I play, the more things I discover that I’d forgotten. And I am surprised how much I’m legitimately enjoying it.
---
It is *a* mechanic. Which is more than most LFR runners can handle. I was in a LFR that wiped nearly 10 times on Aggramar because people couldn't understand that they needed to stack on his Flame Rennd.
---
Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
---
Method lives in your head rent free
---
Notmyjob
---
as someone who did endgame pve and pvp in ESO for a few years, ESO is so bad it literally isn't worth your time, even on a free weekend
---
"classic race to world first"
---
that is crazy.
---
Nice blog post.
---
It’s an online video game played for leisure. Why do you care if you’re average. You’re going to be average at most things in life. Just like the members of that guild are also average at most things in line.
---
30 warrior
---
Just think about it like this, because of them, you can confirm that you do actually have a life. That’s a good thing.
---
This isn't true. I was at a world top 10 kill that one shot him after spawning him. There was still lava splash damage. They stealth nerfed the fight hardcore and then people killed him. It's the same situation as c'thun (which I killed in the world top 10 as well). I'm not bragging I'm just telling you I was there and you're wrong.
---
I think some higher level boxes how decent crafting items. It’s not a priority but I think it’s worth doing to earn a bit extra (charge people at higher levels) and sell crafting items.
---
yeah well its how i feel right now and i do feel like i need to get it off my chest.
---
Capital (shareholders / investors / consultants) are also huge culprits in this situation too. You can see the movement of ownership has a derivative correlation to the ownership of Blizzard; there is another case study that draws parallels in reference to Jagex/Runescape and the whole private server scene.   
---
\^ my TLDR
---
I was about to go into details then realized that its not worth it lol.
---
Mythic plus's success ruined the future dungeons though.  Now they all made for mythic plus and they are pretty not as much funish.
---
Classic raiding is much easier than you think it is. These guys aren't like a super elite swat team. They are good players, and the fights are hilariously easy.
---
Just because they got absolutely destroyed by the "private server noobs" it doesn't mean they weren't serious about it..
---
I mean they kind of skipped alot of stuff but ok
---
Not so much for "Respect You" huh
---
turns out this guy was absolutely hilariously wrong: [https://puu.sh/EbWW9/51a428e954.jpg](https://puu.sh/EbWW9/51a428e954.jpg)
---
grats to apes on a very crazy accomplishment, 6 days from launch both rag and onyx down, i would probaby be around lvl 15 now if i played classic but i've decided to experience the game through the eyes of the streamers because i simply do not have time anymore.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20050509013230/http://www.afterlifeguild.org/
---
Because back then there were no standards  
---
Even in so claimed "Hardcore guilds" there were no standards set.  
---
Like in every guild one half was carrying the other at that time.  
---
You had people that didn't know shit about the game.  
---
Give people today the Pre-Nerf Rag and they will kill him because even every LFR Raider is above most people even hardcore raiding guilds back then had in their roster.  
---
Standards change - Over time you've seen with more mechanics added to the fight and comparisons through data who is just shit at the game and not pulling his own weight.
---
But in MC you took who you could get because there was no pre-raid experience to show off and you didn't have a minimum standard and expecation set.
---
What was a good raider back then isn't one anymore today.  
---
These people that killed Ragnaros today would have killed Pre-Nerf Ragna too with the same Group.
---
Why?Because then they would have killed that version 100s of times on private servers for years.
---
How do you even abuse the layering?
---
There's not even 10 method players playing classic. And all 10 of them aren't even in the same guild. People are just confusing the e-sport organisation Method with the actual guild Method. The whole stream is mostly just a bunch of streamers cashing in on classic hype, like Esfrand, or Jakenbake. And then a few people from random guilds actually going for world first.
---
Pre-nerf C'thun want to have a word.
---
I am not talking about average player, I am talking about players who have played this game for years and wanna raid as boomkin, feral, elemental shaman etc.
---
30.
---
About 4 hours a day. A little more on days off.
---
i was just wondering if they repaired things like the charred holes in city walls and stuff.
---
I want to hit 60 pre-phase 2 just because I feel like the honor system will bring out a lot more pvp and make my leveling a lot slower
---
Dude Scarlet Warrior is such a monster
---
Parry
---
Yes, I am aware, but Method said they were in for the world first race, both lvl 60 and raids.
---
I've had VuhDo working since the stress test, and I've already used it to heal a bunch of dungeons and other group content. I'm having a couple of issues (most notably that I still haven't gotten downranking working yet), but yeah, the base addon definitely works.
---
The stream is Evidence. PROOF of completion. its nothing else. and he has no reputation as a Streamer. I know its a grey area but sometimes laws have to be chosen on a case by case basis. We aint rolling this in into a Technicality
---
Could you combine something like xperl with clique?
---
also if there's any alliance on Faerlina that could forward the thanks, that would be amazing
---
He's really stirs shit about creating chat interaction?
---
???
---
Look at the apes video of the day naxx is patched into the game on a private server. Cleared within four hours.
---
The private servers were an extremely legitimate and faithful recreation of the original game. There were quantifiable differences, mostly bugs, but they were miniscule in the grand scheme of things.
---
Apparently not lol
---
Looks like money well spent to me. Screw the haters.
---
Yea, because they already made the #somechanges decision with the way they are doing content phases instead of patch by patch rollouts with the same itemization/talents at the time.
---
Objectively, none of the raids were ever hard by modern standards with modern player mindsets (minmaxing was done by a *much* smaller percentage of players).  Also objectively however the early raids were *even more* of a joke with 1.12 talents/gear.
---
Jokerd from EU got world first, but my server (Skeram) also has at least 5 guys that got 60 later on last night in a group.
---
For some reason, the mods removed my post. I messaged them asking why and never received a response.
---
Did I write this?
---
The average player doesn't have a pet. I see so many Hunters and Warlocks going solo for some reason.
---
Naxx and AQ40 pugged? Can't wait to see that :)
---
This is a guild that has been playing private servers for several years. They downed Ragnaros before within the first 2 weeks of a new pserver launch.
---
It's not cheating unless blizzard comes out and says it is.  and considering they knew about it months ago and haven't made a single statement about it I wouldn't consider them doing that anytime soon. So stop creating your own rules for the race to 60 and how people play the game.
---
They should be able if you're "phoning it in". Got to be conviction behind it.
---
I LOVE reading all these quasi condescending comments by people that are adopting the “these raids are dummy easy” even though they’re likely to spend hours in them on a weekly basis cause they can’t get people to run them properly. Whilst you condemn speedrunmera for achieving these feats you overlook the potential of your own guilds. The literal YEARS that went into perfecting this run will crush your enumerated wipes in MC. And I say that lightly. Downvote me if you want, but I hope you don’t remember me when you wipe in MC for some stupid reason.
---
Truth. It's that pEU welfare state.
---
Well it took me 86 bears to get 3 bear meat for blood sausages...
---
You completely negate the startup time of wands if you press it at the moment you start swinging your weapon. You'll know when you're doing it right when you see no wand animation but do see 2 white hits on top of eachother.
---
Fuck alliance.
---
waiting for leaks now. :D
---
You are objectively overdoing it. If you're in the crucial age range where you should be socializing or learning new skills, it's overdoing it big time.
---
Easy. Rotate tanks with taunt and shield wall.
---
My social circle doesn't play this game at all. They've heard of it because they aren't living under a rock.
---
Outside of Emerald Nightmare, that's just false. Raids on retail take 1-2 resets to clear on Mythic and have for the last 7 or so raids, with Kil'jaeden being the exception due to bugs and severe overtuning at 19 days. There shouldn't be any comparison between this and a Mythic world first. This is a speed run, not a show of raid knowledge. Getting leveled, geared and attuned (for Ony) are the challenges, not the actual raid encounters.
---
Yooo my dude, RDM in pepega guild. We the best guild
---
write me again when you kill her.
---
They've been on private servers for the past 10 years perfecting everything. One of the streamers, who is still streaming, just said this session alone they have so far been on for 29 hours. 
---
These guys are no-lifing the game, probably are being supported to play it the way they're playing it and are only good because they are hella hardcore.
---
That doesn't mean you're bad. It just means you havent spent the ridiculous amount of hours in the game they have - and you shouldn't. It isn't healthy to most people.
---
Sure, if you only play the game at a casual level or even half as much as they so you may be "average". But why does that matter? And that doesnt even mean youre average. It just means you aren't where they are yet.
---
Time =/= skill. Time in the game only gets you to where you want to be quicker and sooner, it doesnt at all mean youre bad at the game and no-lifing a grind you've been preparing for since 2006/7 also doesn't make you good.
---
Just play the game how you want to play it and enjoy it. 
---
You're fine.
---
Also gear. Check old versions of blue gear from pre-raid dungeons. Most of them were god awful.
---
They patched that I thought, I looked into that addon and it said it can't run the script anymore
---
If you could talk him into rolling another warrior, it sounds like you guys would have the best core for any dungeon group. Otherwise, I’d recommend hunter. They’re super fun 10-60, and they’re amazing during pre-Naxx raiding.
---
not a single human
---
Thunderclap is shit. Demo shout and rend are both good.
---
Unless I missed something: they played premade WSGs with something like 3 APES(there were only 4-5 players from APES in the whole beta when I followed beta streams) and 7 randoms in the beta and lost like 1 out of 10, so a bunch of BFA fanboys/APES "haters"(they were a polarizing guild on pservers to say the least) started pretending they're terrible.
---
In Vanilla, raids were 40! 25man raid came with BC expansion.
---
I can respect an autismo
---
the difference here is that the average raider can spend a thousand hour on the mythic mode and he won't make it far... only the best of the best , playing 15 hours a day, preparing for the raid weeks in advance... manage to kill it in a week ( and that's time spent fighting the boss.... not lvl'ing).
---
Ragnaros on the other hand will easily die to anyone currently clearing heroic mode... or even just normal mode.
---
get a partner and get kids.  works for most people
---
pservers on top!
---
I’m fine with this. This is why the two versions now exist. So that we can choose for ourselves. The various “difficulties” in Classic is what will seperate the wheat from the chaff.
---
I don't even train rend.
---
First raid of any expansion generally requires reaching level cap first.
---
i just want to point out that when wow was originally released it took 150 days for it to be figured out.  Probably for many reasons, but in total the game was complex enough for many many players to not get it until way later.  In TBC many were about half this length.  This was the case for every expansion up until mists of pandaria came out where just about every raid was figured out within 2 weeks of release, many only requiring 1.  BFA has been equally as predictable, because tbh there just isn't that much more blizzard can do with the gameplay to challenge their playerbase.
---
They reworked a lot of blue gear from pre-raid dungeons. Also the new talents and balanced classes. 1.12 was at the end of vanilla, pretty much the patch before TBC patch.
---
Good thing we got you around to tell us how to play chief
---
We all joke here but life comes first.
---
This games not going anywhere you can always come back when you think your in better mindset. Glad you had fun!
---
you can farm elementals in silithus for hydraxian rep , AOE farming mage can do it in like 2 hours, while leveling
---
Literally apes
---
hell yeah lmao what are the odds
---
Agreed but also because of flying. You don't see that any more because your normally above the tree line or taking a portal.
---
I know what you mean its like some of the magic of Classic was lost.  Its like even in retail it takes a few days to kill the last boss in Mythic and you see them wiping multiple times so you see its a struggle for them.  This was a one shot and they barly had any gear.  I understand most people are not nearly this good at the game but still....
---
stats &gt; armour
---
100% I imagine not. It's a job, a chore for them.
---
They'll enjoy the game during their downtime. This grind was nothing more than a grind and race; not something to be enjoyed.
---

---
Ooof how come?
---
there is no rank 14 in phase 1
---
I've played 8-12 hours a day and I'm lvl 30.
---
World first 14 years too late =) clowns.
---
Which do you think is more reliable, the subjective claim that Classic is significantly better than retail, or the objective observation that retail will be receiving continuous iteration while Classic (as far as we know) wont?
---
I enjoy Classic, but it's endgame is niche as hell, and even the more casual players will eventually reach it. Any problem you might have with retail can be fixed (if it's really a problem for the games population) but the problems classic wow has (and those are really numerous when compared to other modern online games) are never going away.
---
Idk but thats hype. I wanted to play all day but couldnt be asked with queue time today
---
reduces their attack speed that is already reduced in power. its great.
---
Why thank you
---
Thats kinda like saying ea didnt make battlefield, dice did. Also sco and other method members were on stream levelling.
---
the normal mode is cleared in a day.
---
the mythic mode is cleared in a week and a half by the absolute best player who spent 15 hours a day bashing their heads against the boss... and by best player I mean 2 or 3 guild out thousands.
---
To even suggest BFA mythic mode are comparable to classic is pure intellectual dishonesty
---
missing out
---
Holy does more damage than shadow. Most shadow talents early on don't actually increase your damage, Mind Flay is awful at low levels, it's impossible to get 5/5 shadow weaving stacks on every mob...
---
Meanwhile holy gives you bonus crit, faster cast time, bonus damage, and extra bonus damage from spirit, all by level 44 (assuming you start wand + spirit tap).
---
By the time you hit 40, you'll get Shadowform, and might consider switching into pure shadow at that point. But I still argue that leveling shadow is a terrible idea. It's incredibly slow no matter what you do. Shadow only gets really good at solo with a lot of good gear at level 60.
---
Especially when you consider that private server guilds train against a massively 15-20% BUFFED naxx. Classic is going to be trivial in comparison.
---
4H and sapphiron will be cockblocks but it will probably be cleared very quickly otherwise.
---
GL with Horde wf in classic. Paladin healers were same OP in PvE as Enchancement Shamans in PvP.
---
Kill everything at your level, or one above or below.  10 mobs equals one quest, in average.
---
This. It's pretty telling that the Icy Veins 'rotation guide' for classic Paladin is, quite literally:
---
&gt;1. Keep Seal of Righteousness up;
---
&gt;2. Melee.
---
And that's a direct quote.
---
Classic wasn’t out 14 years ago =) dunce.
---
Press shoot the moment your character starts swinging their melee weapon then press auto attack again immediatly after and rinse and repeat. With a fast wand you can do 2 hits before smashing your slow weapon again. It's a bit tricky to get completely right but even a free staff hit on a mob whilst lvling can decrease downtime a lot.
---
they farmed dungeons while leveling
---
10% reduced attack speed is not worth the cost on one target. It's a huge waste of rage.
---
I agree on Point 2. But not on Point 1. 
---
You pull a boss once in MC and as long as you go 1 min without wiping you learn the entire fight. The tactics are so trivially easy that "We were learning the raid" is nonsense. 
---
At least how it relates to MC and Ony
---
No they aren't. Trying to argue that vanilla raids were ever even remotely close in difficulty to retail raids is pretty silly. Raids taking a long time to clear in Vanilla was because raiding wasn't even something most people knew was a thing for the first few months not because they were hard.
---
Is this the balance patch that pretty much let people PUG MC and the such?
---
If I recall they were one of the guilds that participated in the infamous funeral raid.
---
I also use `/console ffxDeath 0` to remove the awful death effects
---
Sweet thanks!
---
He is right though, they said it multiple times that the method guild raid roster is not competing for world first but is there to celebrate the classic launch. The persons pushing for world first on their stream are not part of the method guild, but are collective of other guilds. They have stated this multiple times even before joker hitted 60.
---
People 5-manned onyxia back in vanilla, so yea she isn't hard.
---
Did you finish it? If not why do you care?
---
Over half was 60.  26 60s and 14 under 60.
---
you can have a detailed guide, videos, PoV of about every class for mythic bosses and most people won't make it past ashvane, the 4th boss.
---
But i'll take an AoTC guild into molten core, give them a 10 second explanation before the boss, and 1-shot everything.
---
I have no idea man. I played on Feathermoon-NA from release to BC and never heard VC until I started playing on private servers, and there I was told it was an EU thing lol. Since then though I think I’ve just figured out it’s a combination of 1) different realm communities using different terms and 2) contrarians adopting it because they want to use an unpopular term so they can argue. Because at the end of the day, the abbreviation for the name of a leveling dungeon is not the hill I want to die on. But good lord if a dude who uses VC won’t argue until his last breath that I’m wrong if I dare say DM in chat.
---
Also live on social welfare to play 20 hours a day.
---
It's been out less than a week.
---
Yeah I've been using chrome remote desktop and waking up mid sleep to start the queue lol
---
None of the MC bosses had enrage timers so it really doesn't matter. As long as you have a tank with enough gear to survive one rotation of attacks and healers with enough mana pots, you can clear the entire raid with level 55s if needed.
---
wtf I thought the raids werent even open yet
---
Lol ur a savage
---
There's more players now who have a real life, and can only clock in a few hours a day...
---
Do you think it's not subjective? Are you really so confident in your opinion that you think you can speak for all wow players?
---
OH MY GOD! THERE'S A FIRE ...sale.
---
basically people were stupid, and what's considered simple mechanic by modern's standard (taunt swap) was a huge problem back the ( 4 horsemen)?
---
yeah, that's pretty much what retail player have been saying.
---
Probably not that well since they're not mythic raiders, they're classic raiders. If they're all good players then with enough practice I'm sure they could nail the mechanics.
---
Always remember: Everybody with a higher level than you is an unemployed basement dweller, and everybody below you is a fucking noob who hasn't got the slightest clue.
---
It is 2 A.M. soooooooooooo no shit
---
Joke's on you, me and my boyfriend have been playing Classic together!
---
Comparing yourself to people who fort unwittingly trained and then full blown flung themselves into training to be the first is ridiculous.
---
I had tons of time 15 years ago and never raided. Love this game still. I don’t much time now and still love to log in because I can find stuff to do that’s legitimate fun. I can meet new people to complete quests. I can haggle for a 2h axe a lock just got and doesn’t need. I can party w the same guy to run WC a few times. 
---
Take the enjoyment you’re able to attain and don’t let someone else’s accomplishments on a game ruin your good time. 
---
A great game has been re released that’s a ton of fun. Play the game. A “first” title is just proves they are faster.
---
That's a bit short, how about Ragnaro the Fire Lord?
---
that imply MC boss have more than one facet...
---
World of what?
---
Dungeons were fun, but other than the 30% speed boost solo experience was miserable
---
They're not geared. A couple purples here and there but mostly greens.  Knowledge &gt; Gear... the streamer said it himself.  They have done this 1000 times on private servers and used the zf farming method to level.
---
Neither hunter nor druid scale well with gear at end game,  so neither are outstanding in later raids (this is primarily talking about dps).
---
Druid also suffers from the hybrid tax (jack of all trades, master of none).
---
Warlocks suffer in raids from the limited number of debuff (dot) spots and therefore aren't usually allowed to use most of their abilities.
---
Having said all of that:
---
All 3 are very strong revellers.
---
Druids bring a huge amount of flexibility and utility to groups/raids.
---
Raids still need hunters for tranq shot.
---
Everyone still wants locks for a summon!
---
So all 3 are useful, interesting and viable classes, just not fotm classes (mage, rogue, warrior and priest) that top the tables.
---
(Full disclosure - I am maining a feral tank, with warlock and hunter alts...).
---
Herod/Faerlina
---
Did you see the party sync feature they're adding on retail? Not that it will fix leveling, but it'd be great in the context of keeping the leveling experience alive.
---
Rikh has been streaming a lot not sure why you think they are not. Also pretty sure they streamed their rag kill.
---
&gt; **got** to pvp
---
I'm pretty sure you can pvp without that dagger. It isn't a requirement to enter battlegrounds. I think what you meant to write was something along the lines of "*and won in pvp for 2 months because I paid to win*".
---
It’s lame how easily hunters are getting Brokentooth because of layering. It should be competitive and take days to be an authentic experience.
---
My gut would say Herod or potentially Faerlina due to streamers
---
The person that tried to gang him was only level 40.
---
the whole point of vanilla is pveing to own in pvp and contesting world bosses
---
Lol this really devalues the pre-raid bis gear «requirements»
---
Ok, what is it?
---
The same painting is in the Kharanos inn, too.
---
It doesn't look like it was easy, only 12 people are still alive at the end of this kill. Shouldn't most or all be alive by the end if they have a bunch of experience from private servers? That's my perspective, but I never played WoW in it's early days so I don't know what it was like.
---
Because this is literally trivial to them haha.
---
I don't know how much you played to reach 46, but I'd reckon it was less than the apes guys? Seems to point towards time investment again. However, they have the benefit of having other focused people around them to group with and farm instead of fucking around trying to put groups together and making them efficient etc.
---
Completely agree with the last bit, they'll make enough money in the next weeks to last the majority of classic and they'll waste no time getting garbage gold per hour in the months n years to come.
---
How am I being a troll? Maybe I'm not saying my point well enough. Naxx was very difficult when it came out, but people were really bad at the game and had bad computers, internet, etc. Today, any level of Mythic plus has harder mechanics than anything in Naxx.
---
Now I understand why most bosses in later raids got enrage timers...
---
Let’s blow this server
---
I play Gehennas EU, they did nothing but dungeon farm to 60 starting from SM GY, its crazy xp
---
Hope you have an easy time taming as well :) for the photos purposes the only addon would be dominoes for customizing bars! everything else is base ui.
---
Those are all method dick riders tbh
---

---
wow these miners have gotten with the times!! but in all seriousness, I believe that server is breaking ToS and you should report them.
---
Specs are one of the most overstated aspect of noob players. 
---
If you play bloodthirst, deflect, last stand as a Warrior you’re 100% going to be fine tanking. If you take mana efficiency and threat reduction talents as a healer you will probably be fine.
---
It’s more about raiders now knowing how abusive things like potion stacking was. How good engineering is for raiding. Or really what stats and items were best for you.
---
Also ALL of the talent reworks and class fixes are in game. Warriors don’t lose all of their rage when missing special attacks and arbitrarily have an extraordinarily high miss rate for example.
---
Ah, gotchya.  So basically it was people dying to the same shit they used to die to lol
---
Ony is an easy fight, staying awake was probably harder
---
Then we need to account for server population--speed runs are meaningless on a Full server vs a Low server. It's not like he got some gigantic cash prize or a lifetime sub from Blizz, kinda who cares.
---
Because they are streaming, he is making stuff up about not streaming. Rikh streams everything.
---
Wow, that is some serious victimhood mentality.
---
I was around in beta and then launch, and people really forget the first few years of WoW was all about leveling and alts.  That was what made the game originally so successful.  It took time, the word was open, parts of it were hard.  That was the entire package. 
---
 No clue where all that faded and people assumed it was always about end game.
---
Not world first.
---
Dude...The best of hte best struggled for 150 days to beat rag.  It can't simply be because you don't have enough guildies to do MC that it took that long.  
---
I get it that you're in here repping retail like its your business, but classic was difficult for a lot of reasons back then.  APE deserve a lot more respect for having put on such a good show, coming up with clever leveling methods and downing two raids in a day before anyone even woke up.
---
I commend what you're doing for the alliance 👍
---
yeah kind off. but then again we may see many others struggle a lot when a lot of others get to level 60 i mean heck right now apparently average people are having trouble with regular dungons lol. plus i am honestly curious to see how insane nax will be as i heard its unforgiving.
---
On EU Shazzrah and Firemaw have similar queues, firemaw maybe a thousand more
---
idk man some of the challenges in osrs can be pretty difficult if u go in on a pure or something
---
Honestly, don’t even bother with it. You’re a long way from needing anything like that and frankly even at 60 in classic, the thing is marginally useful.
---
WTF... Didn't the FIRST level 60 just hit it yesterday? How are this many people able to A) hit 60 and B) get enough gear to do ALL of MC already?
---
I don't get that.
---
Seeing other people run around world makes it feel much more alive (no flying mounts) and for now anyways, all the leveling zones are quite full. I've been joining random parties for quests which is a tone of fun! 
---
The progression feels good too. As you're exploring getting to know the area so you dont need a mini map, you're questing, leveling professions, making gold, and playing with others. 
---
The pacing has been really nice so far and I've only hit level 13.
---
Add in ony gear, ony buff and full pots and vael is easily doable. BWL will be cleared within 4 hours of its opening. 
---
Since guilds like apes are always clearing stuff so fast, are in the best gear for the time, and will bring all possible consumes the dps check bosses aren’t going to be an issue.
---
Dazalor had like 300 wipes.
---
I'm sure if you counted all the wipes Rag originally caused it was much higher than 1000.
---
Not "shilling for retail WoW". I'm playing Classic just like you are. I just acknowledge that there are some things retail does better. Combat/talents/balance is one of those things.
---
The only advantage of talent trees is that it felt good getting a point per level (which, by the way, Blizzard has acknowledged before in a dev talk). Modern talents don't give you the illusion of choice anymore -- most talents ARE completely viable nowadays or at the very least situational. There are very few "shitty" talents that you can never take and cookie cutter builds just don't exist anymore. Even going on min-maxing sites like icy-veins, they will give you choices on what talents to choose based on your preferred playstyle, and they work! The system isn't "dumbed down", it just had the useless cruft removed.
---
At low lvls you can heal  fine with any talent spec.  So it's best to chose talents that help you lvl up , and you still have to do damage for that.
---
Just make sue you keep buying new heal spells at the trainer , you get new spell ranks every 2 levels  (e.g. 14, 16, 18 etc)  
---
but you don't have to make a 'healing spec' , that will come later at lvl 50+
---
k, and then you have to learn to heal in groups.  The best way is to start easy, just find a quest that people group up for and just concentrate on healing anybody in your group that takes some damage.  This way you get comfortable with switching targets all the time and selecting the right spell  (keybind those) 
---
you also need to use different ranks of the same spell, since only using the latest rank is wasting mana
---
Once you have done this, you go join a 5 man dungeon group as a healer. now you focus mostly on the tank, he will need the most healing, but don't forget to check the other members too, you should be able to heal all of them in normal circumstances.  
---
Bring lots of mana drinks (mages can make those for you, but if there is no mage you have to bring your own. You will often drink after every pull, so make sure you have 2 stacks
---
? Paladins are the strongest single target healers in the game.
---
They really like playing the victim over there lmao
---
Because the ret pally will *schrrr 'round the corner!*
---
That's a strong ass blue for 16 my gosh
---
boomers with family that play the game 5 hours a week
---
That’s when I pop perception
---
Draenei crash into the middle of the sea
---
amen
---
That's how I practiced my clairvoyancy
---
It works I use it to heal now
---
There are still 5 raid world firsts you can get in on, and even more world bosses.
---
Stats &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Armour, even for pure Prot Warriors! Agi = Dodge/ Crit (avoidance + threat) and Str = damage/ Parry (I believe?) so same as before. 
---
I'd say Str/ Stam &gt; Agi but someone please correct  me if this is not the case :)
---
I guess it’s the classic experience
---
I can say that nostaliga plays a certain Role in its popularity right now. However personally having capped my first character in Mists. I can say that no its not ALL nostalgia. Today i healed my first dungeon. Deadmines with friends of mine. And i tell you in retail ive ran 1000s of dungeons. So many Mythic Plusses that push my skill and DPS to its limit. However, running Deadmines, level 17. with a crew ranging from 18 to 15. I had the most fun right here Tonight then i had ever in my many years growing up with Warcraft. It was the memorable moments from a Goblin coming out of a box of Eng supplies to pulling too much and barely surviving but being do damn glad we made it through those 2 or 3 trash packs with only 1 death at most. It was really something wild and special. And now i see i have only 50 more levels of THAT to go and i know. Its going to be a good time.
---
We got dbm now so theres that..
---
Nice layer
---
The server says "HIGH" and it is just below all the "FULL" server smh
---
The funny thing if, jokerd said he'd easily beat his own times too if he instantly started using layering instead of waiting for respawns
---
20% dps for one player yes
---
Ya that's what monkeynews said.  Straight dungeon farming from SM to LBRS.
---
It's crazy how anyone would think MC raiding is hard. The only hard part is getting there and after 10 years of private servers people got that down to a few days.
---
Mate. 
---
I'm level 11.
---
I was a hardcore raider back in the day. 
---
I'm not going to go into MC for several months on my guild probably.
---
That doesn't make me bad.
---
Doesn't make my guildies bad.
---
Certainly doesn't make you bad. 
---
You're not behind anything. 
---
You're exactly where you should be. 
---
That is, doing what you're doing in WoW and enjoying it.
---
If you are serious about wanting to be as hardcore as APES and those guilds. Quit your job, or at least take some vacation. Deprive yourself of sleep, accept that you are not going to have fun and will likely want to quit. Accept that you may damage your health in the long term. Accept that you'll be doing 18+ hour sessions and then you'll be at 60 before you know it.
---
It will be mindless. It won't be fun. It will be a grind.
---
It also won't mean you're good. Why? You wouldn't have had the time to find your footing and understand your class, spec, get your gear right.
---
APES have. 
---
They cleared it fast, yeah.
---
But they also have been preparing for classic specifically since it was announced.
---
They've been getting to this stage over the last 13 years.
---
You want to be at their level? Do the above and wait 13 years. Then you'll be at their level.
---
Stop kicking yourself for something that is a non-issue.
---
You've graded yourself against a test you haven't given yourself which is not fair on you.
---
Okay? 
---
Now go and enjoy the game. You are fine, I guarantee it.
---
Because he's bitching about shit we knew years ago. That's why
---
Method about to have even less after failing at 3 world firsts lol.
---
You can use the addon BetterAlign
---
You dont need that super gear for mc.
---
We had horrible gear and was generally clueless and in s pug and it worked.
---
Lol wtf?? I’m lvl 18 haha
---
👀 T H I C C 😂
---
Probably not considering the Nax event takes more than a day to finish. Even if you're talking about the first day that people can zone in, that's a tall order. Nax is a very large raid and its full of gear checks. It was also balanced around 1.12 gear and talents. I would buy first week clear, but even if a guild was making good progress it would still be tough to clear the whole thing in just 24 hours. Particularly because there won't be much T4 gear in the raid. Keep in mind guilds were using world buffs and shit to beat the last few Nax bosses. Even accounting for improvements in skill, it seems very difficult to imagine 4 Horsemen, Sapphiron and KT going down to a raid wearing almost entirely T3 shit.
---
That’s cause PS got Ony wrong. Per Nano and Blizz
---
Ah, but when you swap weapons to a type you haven't used in a while...
---
The raid has been out for fifteen years. It was cleared by a group that has literally been clearing it on other servers for years. There is very, very little impressive or noteworthy about it. Pay no mind to it, and play the game.
---
Pffft retail players
---
Don't worry. You will down the bosses also. I think of WoW as a marathon, not a short race.
---
ahh even more great i am in the est lol. the issue is though i already made quite a bit of porgress with my toon on the server i have and idk if i want to lose it :/
---
You can just right click the frame and theres an option to unlock them.
---
Very poorly. There’s really no talent or skill required to kill a boss that been out for fifteen years. This isn’t even in the same galaxy as current raiding in retail.
---
35 and feel like it's taking you to long.
---
No your actually going faster then the majority of people. That long feelings is World of Warcraft
---
 Aren't curses only able to be applied one at a time? I'm guessing they're dependant on the boss/mob for rotation? 
---
Lock is sounding more and more like my choice
---
[*laughs in paladin*](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/qsFvJfn)
---
It was hard for kids playing it for the first time. I remember progressing, and yeah it was an uphill fight. But we weren't pros who'd been doing it on private servers literally hundreds of times. We were terrible.
---
Yea because anyone of them could give a single shit about classic lmao
---
I always feel so bad keeping people around just for my slow RNG! lol I'm always happy to help to, so I don't know why.  My first WC all those years ago was a longggggg run as well hah.
---
My exact fuckn thought
---
They have had a ton of updates for classic over the last days.
---
Literally this exact sequence of events happened to me tonight. Same number of eviscerate misses even.
---
I actually made a decent amount of silver off fishing.
---
I am on a pvp server so I think that names a good fit.
---
server had been out for 5 days when it died, thats 24h of sleep over 5 days, how is that so impossible?
---
You realize all they have done is basically play classic with bits of sleep here and there right ?
---
I've met tons of keyboard turners, there are some real average-joes out there :)
---
Go talk to a therapist about your anxiety. We arnt trained to help you
---
The funny thing is 95% of those groups are probably gonna fail badly or if nothing else, not get effective xp. It’s not something you can expect to pull off easily with strangers, these guys have been playing together for years.
---
Hillsbrad is the best zone.
---
That town never knew what hit it. I mean, you didn't just kill them, you took their skulls too. Then you made a goddamn ring out of one of their skulls. Hardcore.
---
You killed everyone who mattered in the town, and a ton of the farmers too. You killed the mayor in the town hall and even burned the town charter. Shit, you even poison the town dog.
---
And then in Cataclysm, we get to see what all our hard work paid for. A beautiful Forsaken shithole town. The circle of life, ladies and gentlemen.
---
I love Hillsbrad.
---
That's just it. It's 1.12. Sure players were bad back in the day but blizzard also put out a broken game.
---
Have you ever tried doing some tedious bullshit nonstop for 5 days straight? It takes either drugs or serious commitment
---
I think Method will not get any World Firsts in Classic if this goes on... haha :D
---
They kinda did. Kr0nos3 was a very close recreation with stats from vanilla which were laughed out of the room by the server community, because the content and raids were so easy.
---
Going by K 3 estimates, they knew everything they had done on Nost, LH, ND would be harder than what they would be attempting in classic MC.
---
But this is a problem for the no-life guilds, not me!
---
If you have already cleared MC / Onyx, what are you going to do for the next six+ months???
---
I know what my plan is: 3+ months enjoying BBC the levelling experience, 1 month 'progressing' through MC/Onyx; 2 months gearing and getting excited about next tier!
---
You can't do them all.
---
don't feel bad when you have to drop a few quests because they are grey or green and you need room for new higher lvl ones.
---
The game was not designed with the idea that you did everything, but with the idea that you would never FIND everything (no Questie in 2004)  so they made sure you would find enough.
---
When you start a 2nd character some day, you can then remember, oh yeah I skipped those quest there last time, lets do them n this time.
---
But that's pointless. Mobs would dodge or resist 80% of your attacks if you are 4 levels below. Only healers can make it work in lower level cause they don't need to DPS or tank.
---
Okay. I still doubt they did more than 300 pulls on Ragnaros before wiping. 
---
And that's because "god tier raiders" back then, with 0% mechanical improvements for 15 years would wipe in LFR and get flamed for bad DPS
---

Then stick it out. If in the long term your server starts to die, then you can start finding alternatives.
---
Denial
---
&gt;Vanilla raids require a partial raid of almost max players in greens and blues to one shot every boss.
---
Cleared Naxxramas back in classic.
---
Most of us still had a lot of blues when Kel'Thuzad died. I *think* only our main tank was full purple.
---
When we cleared MC we had way more greens than blues. The screenshot shows 33 people on our first Rag kill.
---
It's just the way classic is. Gear drops were crap and it was super hard to get a full 40 man raiding group together.
---
It was cleared in 4 hours on private servers without world buffs on day 1, and we know they are grossly overtuned now.
---
COPE
---
How is Elvui in classic? Their website made it sound like it was pretty buggy because it’s in beta
---
Can you enter 5 man dungeons as raid?
---
I wonder why they have so many gnomes?
---
Dream paragon was a merger of the I think Chinese guild DREAM and paragon
---
Streamers nowadays do SOLELY because of money and publicity.
---
Method for example; they're a professional company. A business. 
---
Blizzard utilises that to earn more revenue. 
---
Back in 2004? That wasnt a thing. No one had special privileges. They dont now either.
---
Anyone can technically get into the PTR. Just enable it on your account. 
---
You need to stop with this mentality of "they're better than me because they did it before me". It's not healthy and not necessarily true at all.
---
Meme specs can't raid on the patch MC was released and cleared on. Lucky for meme specs Classic is on the patch that buffed the shit out of meme specs.
---
Ok guys game is over go home now :D
---
Hah, and my "professional" friend claimed it would take at least 11 days. Well jokes on you, someone did it! I mean, not me, I'm level 12, but someone!
---
Yeah this sub has been talking about how hard classic is for months. Now everything has been cleared in under a week everyone is acting like the consensus has always been it's easy.
---
DM was released like 3 months from launch, so I assume P2 will be about the same. Next raid content is BWL and that is in Phase 3, so you will have time. It's almost better since DM has a lot of pre-raid BiS.
---
Well worth the price.
---
I'll be buying mine asap before prices hike up.
---
You are the reason servers die.
---
Half their guild isn't even playing. They're all competing in the MDI or are playing classic casually. How can you unironically say they're not skilled because they didn't do MC first. It's literally the easiest end game content in the game. How come apes haven't got any world first retail kills where it requires more than one attempt per boss and has multiple complex mechanics?
---
honestly i have put everyone around me on a pedtisal as you put it.(the only people whom i do not put on a pedastal and wish it was me are maybe babies) and some dumb ass stupid pathtic horrible teengers maybe. but even then they are somehow better then me.
---
This aged amazingly! Good call
---
And I expect the Hunter got dibs

No its 1 curse Per warlock. so you have 4 or 3 Warlocks for 4 or 3 perm curses

Leveling deep holy is great for both leveling and easy dungeon grouping. Holy fire crits are lovely.
---
No one is even at the point were hanging out in org is a thing
---
How do you feel about it? Just a part of classic?
---
Why is this guy downvoted?
---
All rolling need if agreed upon before you start is literally the only way to prevent a ninja looter.
---
Literally just lost 2 good boes in sm to a rogue. They were leather but no agil.l, then left. 
---
If you want to even then you can roll 100 or whatever.
---
World first guild switching back to retail.
---
So I guess METHOD can stop leveling now :D
---
You realize they have been clearing for years on private servers right?
---
Edit: I’m an idiot. Wow, by golly they done it!
---
You don't even have to leave this sub. They've all come here to tell us how terrible Classic is because APES killed Rag and Onyxia foor the millionth time.
---
Now we will all obviously go back to BFA grinding the casino. Or not.
---
Alliance attunement is a joke compared to horde. One of the reasons I went alliance this time around. I remember my friends and I complaining about how easy Alliance had it while we were doing our ridiculously long Ony attunement back in vanilla.
---
They've designed the raids around it so they didn't change it for classic.
---
As others have said, not true. DPS warriors are very good and you need more of them than you need tanks.
---
i mean back then numerous people were still turning with their keyboard, walking backwards and had no concept of LOS.  Of course they're going to be daft, and I promise you there were in total WAY more wipes on rag than any other boss in this game.  It was never mechanically challenging, it was a matter of coordination, proper party setup and gear check.  Also probably latency too.
---
... I was the unsuccsessful ganking orc Hunter. Wanted it for myself.

If you cant afford professional help (idk where you're from), see if your school or work offer guidance and support - most do.
---
Or you've got sites like 7cupsoftea.com etc that provide free support for things like this.
---
It looks like he wants you to smash
---
You are! Keep up the good work leveling, man.
---
They are never *good* for pve, but if you really want to play one you can probably get groups and stuff.
---
But in PVP they are actually good, though afaik they have Mana issues.
---
In pve raids one can be brought for shadow weaving, to buff the warlocks damage. But a healing priest can also be specced into the talent and most likely be more effective in their role.
---
I am leveling a priest to play healer myself, and I'd say unless you'd really like to PVP as shadow don't bother. They are similar to a mage or warlock in pve except they don't really work. Nothing special or enjoyable about their playstyle or spells if you're just straight dpsing.
---
They did. Last time was 9days, but that was on an overtuned raid (as the vast majority of pservers are in comparison to classic).
---
Gear was awful up through naxx. Warriors had spirit on items, the best weapon in the game was an AQ dagger
---
Barely sleeps at all, hits lvl 59 and lost world first to 60. If they weren't going for world firsts they wouldn't play 20 hours a day.
---

Here. The other link had a typo with a missing space.
---
Very surprised you don’t have to be lvl 60 to enter these raids.  Was these the norm through all raids on vanilla?
---
Most people will probably walk in with full 60's and actually have some gear/enchants/pots though.  We already know from private servers that most people are able to do the fight with little to no difficulty.
---
That said, I'll admit it is just a minor nit pick.  Really it only affects the early raids in a significant way, and even if they did do patch-by-patch talents/gear it would be a later version by the time the majority of the player base gets to it anyway.
---
Blessing of Wisdom makes the next 5 minutes of my life way better. Keep it up, friend!
---
yeah well idk what if my server is a dead one already compared to any others.
---
You're right I didn't play hunter until then
---
I like playing as a DPS and I love playing my Shaman but I know I won't get into raids as Enhancement because people only take one or two per raid and I know those spots go to the guild clique.
---
So I've been at a dilemma: I want to raid but I also want to have fun with my friends and one of them is levelling a mage already. Should I reroll into Mage or bite a bullet and try my way into Enhancement?
---
I play Resto in dungeons but I have zero clue about how it plays at 60. To be fair, I'm just not looking forward to respeccing from Resto to Enhancement just to farm gold or stuff like that. I guess that's why everybody had a "pocket mage" in Private Servers.
---
#nochanges. Nothing's changed.
---
Some guy who spent the past year angrily shitting on private servers being over undertuned, telling everyone they would get crushed in Classic when the "real" difficulty kicked in.

Imagine saying this and rag getting killed world first 15 hours later.
---
2 hours tops.
---
ye he did cause during that time his brother was playing (: How do you think he got 60 in 3d7h on the 30th August when the game released midnight 27th, lol.
---
If all RPers band together to make our realm RP friendly, we can keep out the toxic players or at least minimize the damage. I’m not saying go after every non RPer, at obvious which ones are toxic, do what you feel is right to keep our server a RP-PvP server and not just another bland server where RPers hide amongst themselves. We have made great strides already in the realm so far. Keep at it.

Why play a game ya hate.

Works for me too. Cant figure out the buff timer cause I'm a nub but otherwise it's handy as balls.

took one for the load
---
Vanilla is not hard, it’s time consuming.
---
Method dudes were just sore in the butt for loosing so hard. Its not like they lost,but they were not in the fight at all. Apea geta rag and ony, method farms zul'farrak.

What do you mean by "it's pve as much as it is pvp"?
---
No, it's the rogue that's about to gank you
---
And ah the deep rock salt and elemental earth?
---
Most arguments were if it would be week 1 or 2. They did it on week 2 at pservers, so I was never in any doubt.
---
It's just amazing that they did it first week, considering all people it takes to get the attunements done.
---
APES have perfected their entire raid composition. They've been clearing these raids for years and over 200 times.
---
99% of players won't be able to.
---
If you think it is possible, go grab some randos that were around the same level as the raid comp in APES and see how you do.
---
And this is why we should cancel any plans for TBC, and instad release previously scrapped vanilla content (like dragon isles) with entirely new mechanics designed with the vanilla philosophy.
---
TBC will be cleared just as fast, if not faster since most of the raids are out on release anyways.
---
Maybe some high level has that and can buy it as investment for later
---
They won't.
---
Layering exists though, so you're wrong.

Level 44 with 275 herb and 250 mining and 200 lockpocking. Got my mount at 40. Played roughly 3 days 5 hours
---
It's "hard" in that there are very few quality of life systems and everything takes time and patience to complete. It's not at all complicated or difficult other then that. One of the things they've done well in Retail has been raid design, but unfortunately everything else they've done makes the game unplayable.
---
Right, because 7 people from Method doing something means nobody from Method is doing something, because those 7 people don't exist unless there's 33 more of them. Obviously.
---
How about the horde's? According to Madseason's video, all you need to do is like 3 UBRS runs and some traveling around the world to kill 4 elite drakes. That's much better than the alliance's. You can gear up in UBRS and get a knife that adds 15 skill level to skinning. That is a crucial item because you need 315 skinning to skin Onyxia for her scale, and that scale is the key ingredient for a cloak in Nefarian fight, in which everybody must wear one.

they've already enjoyed the journey before so for them the reason to rush is mostly for fun. 
---
also no glory in it? 350k viewers for jokerds world first lvl60 and idk what moO's stream peaked at but I saw 30k some time after rag was down. [jokerd went from being literally no one on twitch to having 100k+ followers in a couple days](https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/jokerdtv).
---
Dude... Cmon man, you need to stop comparing your self worth with other people.
---
But MC was never thought of as hard. If you had a 20 man group good enough to clear ZG, you could literally take those 20 people into MC and clear it.
---
BWL and AQ were much harder, but they were a buggy mess, sadly. Everything died pretty quickly after it got patched.
---
Impressive shit. People on official forums and other forums trying to discredit their achievements xD. 99% of those people Are nowhere nesr lvl 50. What they did is truly impressive. Gz to APES
---
&gt; The average time to get 60 back then was cited as 4-5 months.
---
I'd like to see the stats for that.
---
&gt;with a gigantic queuing playerbase it was a slow ramp up.
---
I also don't remember this being the case.  I have pretty distinct memory of the game taking off pretty quickly, and suprassing all expectations due to it coming out right after thanksgiving (hot time to buy presents)
---
Stop playing right now! You might summon C’thulu next or something! 🙈
---
Thats insane.
---
for Rag they had 40 People, 25 of them lvl60, the rest was mostly 58-59 and the lowest lvl was a lvl 56 paly.
---
for Ony they had 34 People, and needed 2 trys.
---
And the Patch back then and used now, made it possible to kill Rag. Back then most Bosses where too strong when released and patched to kill.
---
I agree with you for the most part, and that's a good analogy. But still, their sponsoreds, who *were* competing for it (e.g. Tipsout) got rinsed. Method can't have it both ways, he either reps the org or he doesn't. It is more like if Usain Bolt beat an official Real Madrid rep in the 100m in some weird world where Real Madrid has an official track team.
---
The amount of stupidity in this thread. Tons of groups are exploiting this right now to earn xp at faster rates than normal and people are asking OP to "prove it"?? How much more can he prove, the raid xp penalty literally isn't in the game right now and people are abusing it.
---
Yes, they advertised it as such.
---
When that gnome got first 60 they kept saying that the real race is to get first Ragnaros or Onyxia.
---
Naked
---
You are possessed by a demon bro
---
What is your post history???
---
Yeah, servers are overloaded again.
---
I have been playing around for days and finally came up with this:
---
```
---
/castsequence reset=target !Shoot, null
---
Seems so
---
Block everything!!
---
Currently the same on Yojamba
---
&gt;talk trash about someone
---
&gt;they comment on it
---
&gt;accuse then of playing victim 
---
Lmao okay kid
---
Please cry moar
---
Yeah in game everythings fucked. Ive been trying to res at my corpse for 2 mins now
---
Same here, Oceanic server
---
Personally, I wanna see all the races when the new phases get released. Everyone would be on an equal footing
---
I was having a lot of fun listening to the stream while I've been playing my own character. The casting line up is knowledgeable and entertaining, but then losers in twitch chat trolling just ruin the experience cause they force the casters to reply to the spam.
---
Legion honestly was my favorite expansion since wrath
---
But I’m also one who didnt hate cata, and enjoyed Mop as well. Only expansion I disliked was wod. 
---
No post launch content besides raids opening up, basically a paid raid patch not an expansion
---
Did you remember to put the higher rank FBs on your bar after learning them? I had the same issue lol.
---
Yes, multiple reports of server issues in guild and general. Servers probably toast.
---
True but to an extent, you can buy membership time on retail, giving you classic.
---
Finally this will prove that pugging MC is easy as fuck and doesn't require pre BIS gear. Just dedicated tanks
---
Yeah, i timed out for a while in game. Had to force close it and now stuck on the black screen again.
---
Peak hour again. Rough.
---
I think so... I just dced while I was in wailing caverns almost at end boss lol. 
---
now my character screen is black like last time....
---
That's for you to decide. 
---
Just be happy you get to experience it now without putting all this unnecessary pressure on yourself to be at the same standard as a group of 40 people in a game with 1 million+ people, most of which will be in the same position as you.
---
Haha, idk, just running on high at 1440p xD
---
I look forward to this being the new line being held only for the raids to crumble on the day they are released.
---
Okay, lowkey that is a super baller move. Way to go APES
---
Method is much more than a guild, you know. It’s become a brand. Method, the organisation, arranged the event to celebrate WoW classic with only a handful of people from the guild actually playing. Their goal has never been to get world first, they’re simply celebrating the launch of the game.
---
That bar is called... nameplates.
---
Do you really think if we went back to Legion or WoD, a top tier guild wouldn't be able to clear the content in a week?
---
In total across all guilds? Doubtful as iirc Raggy doesn't even appear in top 20 of the "Most player kills" list Blizzard put out. Vael topped that list for YEARS. 
---
Across the top guilds who got WF?
---
Again. Doubtful. Uu'nat holds the current recorded record of some 1000 wipes before Pieces killed it. Some 750 before Method killed it. 
---
What this meant for Method was about 45-60 hours of raid time. 3-4 days of Wiping uu'nat for 16 hours a day. Just the sheer amount of time it takes to release. Run. Buff. Reclear trash (don't forget it respawns). Rebuff And pull with 40 people in the raid. I don't think any Guild played long enough hours in raid to mathematically manage 1000 wipes. Or even the 350 method had on Jaina.
---
at about 11% hit stat, hunters do not miss, I remember that from vanilla
---

How did you find questie. When I search on my MAC questie does not show up
---
Just started for me too.
---
Its a lot of time, but not difficult at all. 'most players won't see onyxia by the end of winter' is probably wrong.
---
He has the right to have his own political opinion
---
Yep, experiencing same thing again
---
True,people seem to forget that these guys did that 100+ minimum probably ON OVERTUNED privates servers and they could probably do it blindfolded.And now people here think that they themselves will do it without wipes LOL.
---
Asshole....friend....wants to quest in peace but can’t I friend...what is this shit.
---
&gt; people will lose interest in the game on a competitive level 
---
Why should I care?
---
Same way speedrunners do it really. They have a community and that community makes it fun even after 4000 hours.
---
Poly it, CoC/blink/IB to kite until nova is up again, Cold Snap, just run and reset, ignore it with barrier up - are all options. What's best depends on the situation. With 3/3 ele precision and mainly killing mobs equal level or lower it should be very rare anyway.
---
Yep, just froze on me midway on Deadmines... thx bliz
---
Tbf, none of these are world firsts. The WFs were done 15+ years ago.
---
Plus, the reason world first races on the Live/Retail/whatever you wanna call it, are interesting is because they're new fights. Every single fight in Classic has been cleared hundreds of times on Blizzard-like private servers, even in the last month. The players who are doing raids right now were practicing for months on private servers before hand. They know the strat in and out. There's no adapting, there's no ingenuity.
---
I don't like BfA at all but still find Method's WFs on that version of the game much more impressaive than these "WF" kills.
---
I’m confused with the hate...the whole point I’m making is that it looks pre shit for the classic community that an MMO which is considered one of the hardest MMO’s out atm was finished in 4 days...whilst we still got kids at lvl 4
---
Rotate between Redridge, Ashenvale, Wetlands and Duskwood. All have a billion 20 to 24 quests you can do.
---
It's fun running over 1 person with 20 ppl?
---
&gt;debuff slots 
---
Holy shit I forgot about that
---
The level 59 guy was not in method lol, he was in some Path of Exiles guild, which were indeed trying to get world first.
---
None of the people who were above level 50 on that stream were in Method, they were being hosted by Method though.
---
They weren't competing, they were hosting/broadcasting other guilds which were competing, plus some random streamers. They're trying to like ESPN basically.
---
I had a guy leave in the middle of Deadmines because of real life stuff, whatever shit happens, went to go fill and the moment the guy joined "Oh, i can see why you guys wiped yeesh" and just left. he had literally no idea what happened, honestly probably because we told him to wait a minute while we fought our way to the entrance to escort him to the portal into the dungeon. was kinda just taken aback at the speed of his negative reaction.
---
Not for alliance.
---
Same as above reports in Yojamba.
---
Have the same issue :(
---
Enjoy the game ! See you in azeroth
---
Here we go again, hopefully not another 4 hour maintenance like the other day
---
realm list shows no characters on any realm this time interestingly
---
Remulos here, same problem
---
I mean they didnt even have full raid of 60s, how much harder do you want them to make it?
---
i do not fucking remember that shit lol
---
AHAHAHA i like got my vendor price and icehud and was liek "im fucking back boys!"
---
til im in fact not entirely back.
---
thank you for reply
---
The hybrid tax is the idea that Blizzard deliberately made hybrid classes less good at each role, because they bring more flexibility.  ie druids are not the best dps, tanks or healers in the game, BUT, they can do all 3 roles.
---
Having said that, modern theorycrafting has shown that there are very few rubbish specs.
---
Druids can:
---
Tank - generally seen as strong 5-man tanks and solid off-tanks in raids.
---
Dps - feral is actually decent dps, but their damage doesn't scale at all with gear, so they fall behind as you progress through the tiers. Balance is one of the few 'rubbish' specs (although I don't know much about it, so someone else may well correct me!).
---
Heal - I understand that they are perfectly decent healers, even if not top tier.
---
But...
---
The big advantage is that druids can do ALL of these at once (well, in different fights in a single raid).
---
So, while it might be more optimal on one particular fight to have a fury warrior than a feral druid dpsing, when you look at the raid as a whole, it is much more optimal to have a druid than a tenth fury warrior! The warrior is stuck as dps or (a rather reluctant) tank; the druid can switch between all 3 depending what the fight requires.  Druids also bring more utility (crit buff, innervate and combat res primarily).
---
And yes, druids can focus (to some extent) on a particular area.  It depends how you want to play.  I want to be as close to a main tank as possible and cat dps when I have to, so my build will reflect this.  Others may want be a healer who can also dps (and off-tank if required); some might want to try and create a balanced spec, where you truly are jack of all trades, but master of none (although this would probably work much better focusing on levelling dungeons than raiding).
---
Either bare show or fishnet. 
---
The mankini with the thigh high is pretty popular.
---
I think I managed about 4 hours on ESO before realising it was shif
---
Let's hope it's a faster fix than last time.
---
rofl what? 7 streamers who happens to play in method cashed in on the classic hype like every other streamer on Twitch. you realize raiding is a team effort right? Hard to compete in a team competition when you don't even have nearly enough people to fill out a team.
---
Do you understand that the majority of POV's from the stream were from people in other guilds than Method?
---
those fuck from beta ! ikh !
---
its the same on yomomma is blizzard fucking serious with this!?
---
I love this haha. I was wondering tho, how intense is the RP part of Grobbulus? I kind of want to join the server because I keep seeing cool community events like this but I'm not a huge RP'er
---
35. I am your god now.
---
Ah to be honest its super easy to setup! I am a youtuber and streamer so you can always pop by the stream and  I dont mind showing you! ill have a ui guide up once i settle into lvl 60.
---
These fights are easier then normal raids. The last 3 BFA bosses on norm will be harder them anything in classic.
---
In addition to what everyone else said; if your levelling as a duo, you will be getting through quests quicker but getting less mob kill xp.
---
enjoy your month's of grinding to achieve literally what they done in 5 days :D

I'm doing it as a Warlock and I feel like sometimes the guide isn't viable and is obviously just suited to a Hunter. Can't imagine what it's like as other classes. I won't be following it 2nd time through.
---
thats just like, your opinion
---
I remember back in vanilla, for my first character I rolled a mage because my friends said they had the prettiest animations. I decided to go fire because that sounded cool and I could imagine I was Carrie. My friends decided that a fire mage needed a fire pet - and that this was somehow integral to our party - and they saw this on thottbot, so we all braved this huge trek to Dustwallow to kill whelplings for several RL days until it dropped. I was like level 20 and had no idea what was going on, but when I clicked the icon it was freaking awesome to see a fiery little dragon minion appear and start following me. He became our mascot :)
---
How mad are you right now. You have become a meme...
---
Does Blizzard pay you to shill for BFA around here?
---
Ye i know but still
---
bunch of useless cunts
---
I bound pet attack and pet follow to mouse wheel.  
---
Works amazing, and gives me a bit more control than immolate macro would. And drain life ticks after a second, it's not instant damage, but it's better than anything else at tagging if mob is out of range for void.
---
Not sure what the oceanic hosting situation is but there's some serious issues Blizzard are unable/refusing/lacking knowledge to fix.
---
this can happen with any fandom ever
---
i actually don’t believe you at all.. there was no naxx clearing guild that hadn’t farmed BWL and AQ40 since their patch.. the idea that you would have only one member in epics is fucking absurd.  I was in an MC/BWL guild and had no blues.
---
who would win: A billion dollar company or a 15 year old game
---
They literally have like 10 method player split across multiple guilds. Like this is literally viewable on their stream. How the fuck can you unironically think they were participating in this race?
---
Why can't classic fans just enjoy their game without sitting on retail? Is it because it just lost a huge chunk of magic, just 5 days in, when a bunch of non 60s in greens and blues just cleared the hardest content in the game?
---

i am sure streamers have confirmed unless you know someone at blizz or you are a really famous streamer its random luck if you get in or not into betas i think.
---
VanCleef. It's the family name of the "end boss" in the dungeon.
---
Ah well, time to take a 3 hour break after my strenuous 5 min play session.
---
well I bet they are, some of  their best-known content creators are currently streaming -guess what- WoW Classic on Twitch and clearly enjoy it a lot, it's refreshing to see them so happy in a game for a change. 
---
I have thousands of hours in eso (hence the username here) and i like(d) the game, but it has so many performance-issues, it's unbelievable. PC EU has seen some crazy stuff over the last months, everything from random disconnects for whole raidgroups in PVE which reset the instance, mobs bugged so hard that it causes wipes, dungeon tool not working (even with a premade group from zonechat you just can't port into a dungeon...), PvP at primetime is just unplayable unless you enjoy a slideshow of 2 fps.. And the latest patch is a kick in the face to endgame-players, dumbing down class identity and making raid-combat mindnumbingly dull. Last point was the last straw for me, and i am what you'd call a hardcore-pve-raider over there. I cannot recommend ESO to anyone at the moment, first they need to get their shit together and fix their servers.
---
Combat-wise, eso is a lot faster than WoW classic, in classic it is very difficult for me getting used to all those long casttimes and cooldowns.  
---
Still, I really really love WoW classic so far, i haven't had this much fun in a game for a VERY long time! It is just SO MUCH FUN. Currently level 22, doing quests with my partner (who also came from ESO) and we even have done our first dungeon. Both of us had never played WoW before but are totally hooked already, this weekend was madness. Hectic food-preparations for the whole day during the morning queue and whatnot. We'll see how leveling goes further down the road but at the moment I can see us play this awesome game for a long time! Sorry for the long post, I felt the need to vent a bit.
---
VanCleef

Can use the Legion Table where it take quantities fro every realm.

now that i think about it it also worked for me in kalimdor

ill go to darna to check if it has anything to do with it
---
VanCleef.
---
You never quit wow, only take breaks
---
I don't know about pre-nerf Rag, you would have to run the numbers, but I don't think you can just assume this. My understanding is that pre-nerf C'Thun is not considered killable by the private server guilds (they have run the numbers for that).
---
They oughta patch the original fights back in to the game.
---
You can open lockboxes btw
---
Are servers down? I was really worried my character got deleted
---
TP / ignite
---
It wasn't a warlock it was a shaman who ahnked and used frost shock to kill it.
---
Are they using Jagex's servers?
---
I don't understand? What line?
---
Kinda. EA publish the game, but they don't make it.
---
Method as a guild never tried to go for WF Ragnaros. They're taking a break from doing EP. Forcing the players to go on another 3-4 week prep/practise time and then go 16+ hours everyday once Classic launches would be dumb and too much for the players. Method, the organisation however is hosting an event in celebration of the Classic launch in Las Vegas. Some Method players decided to attend the event. That doesn't mean Method the guild planned on going for worlds first.
---
Man this community is so fucking retarded. All you lot talk about is how Classic is about the community, and yet it's one of the most toxic communities online. Method hosts an event for Classic and yet all you do is flame them for no reason.
---
The paladin hurts.... I rolled a pala
---
It seems low actually given his viewercount since classic.
---
Yes. 10 people max.
---
Where did you manage to find the English version of dreamcast1991's Russian guide?

Short dungeons.

Agreed im waiting for the price on assassins blade to blow up for twinks
---
Having played the naxx reboot in WOTLK it didn't seem like complicated mechanics came in till BC
---
TBC will be cleared in a 3 days (Kara/Gruul/Mag/Hyjal/Tempest keep, SSC). Other raids will be cleared immediately on release as well.
---
and then we are left with a shittier game, where TBC is a shell of the great game that vanilla WoW is (infinite amount of conveniences, portals everywhere, flying mounts, extreme faction imbalance etc).
---
Take the OSRS route, create dragon isles, make Kara a 40 man raid and keep the game actual good instead of repeating the mistakes of the past by releasing expansion that makes the game shittier.
---
\#FuckTBC
---
Aaaahhhh method lost the first 60 race and the first kills in classic wow.
---
Must really suck to be method. Such arrogant pricks.
---
I hope they don't speed up the phases because of guys like this.
---
I started WoW in early 2006, just before Naxx, so a lot of the endgame content from patches 1.2 to 1.10 was completely lost to me and something I'd like to actually experience.
---
Anyways, grats to those guys.
---
yup, was thinking of rolling on NA  &gt;.&lt;
---
yep they are down
---
Ohh did Method kill Rag?
---
Yeah sure probably.
---
Doesn't mean the world is out to get you. These people worked toward that kind of recognition and getting into betas etc was nothing more than a business transaction for PR.
---
If you want to get to that status then take the steps. Start a twitch or YouTube channel. Gain a following. 
---
These people didn't get this stuff overnight.
---
Murloc and dwarf 😢
---
Black screen of death
---
"No change" simply means no dumbing down features in expansions. The most hated ones are LFD/LFR, flying, tokens, heirloom, transmog, achievement, etc. But whatever exists in vanilla wow, including cross-real BGs, are acceptable.
---
This is LFR level of difficult. Most people will do it for sure. The hardest part for these raids will be finding 40 people in trade chat.
---
This game is ridiculous lmao.
---
I suppose the true vanilla enjoyment factor is gone.  I spent weeks dying in MC because people couldn't figure out basic shit.
---
Eh whatever.  Glad I'll get to enjoy the content at a slower pace.  I do hope wow will develop more 40 man content and get some crazy difficult shit
---
Does this mean Feral MTs might now be a reasonable choice?
---
Yeah fair point. The Classic Guild sponsored by Method lost. I guess i'm trying to make the distinction because people are trying to make it a retail vs classic thing, as in the retail guild got beaten by the private server guilds.
---
APES was vanilla pserver people though. Mythic raiding has nothing to do with that
---
High mob density i guess
---
I know from this that you had to jack off approximately 30 humans.   You decide if that makes you the bad guy.
---
AHHHH-OHH-Ohhh.
---
People with gear should be easily able to do 25 people. In classic my guild found Onyxia to be easier with 25ish leople
---
I'm with you. I dont get their side either. I've had a blast playing classic and engaging with others. I'm on Bloodsail Bucaneers and it's been super fun.
---
nobody is in org because theres little reason to be there
---
Ragnaros was also bugged for a long time in release. After one wipe he would start spamming the lava splash when people tried to walk back to the lair. It was basically one try every reset, because he also despawned after like an hour of being summoned. It also wasnt uncommon that Majordomo just failed to summon him, and MC in general was really buggy.
---
The guy you're responding to being one of them. Doing nothing but bashing classic for some reason. 
---
Is BFA really so dead they need to try to convince people on Reddit to go to BFA?
---
If Classic means behaving like a damn idiot to you and spamming "anal (insert skill)" in Barrens chat all day, go ahead. Most players grew out of that.
---
Woah this is a really hard conversation to follow, and I feel like I kinda get the game. This was a trip.
---
If they never said the world first shit i'd have some more sympathy but they really pushed it when talking on stream and the titles etc.
---
For all the advantages they have (from being Method essentially) they really fucked this one up and missed by quite some margin.
---
If you want to run shadow you should probably go with a priest.
---
There will be 1 per raid for shadow weaving.
---
Not possible, only Chinese ID card is accepted :O
---
you must be the tank I got earlier! /s
---
It was on the frontpage when you made the comment talking about keeping it down.

---
Sure. But that's buggy and broken. Not hard.
---
They have enjoyed Classic for 6-7 years? Now it's more than nostalgia for them
---
It probably did for him, I imagine he just wanted some sleep at the end
---
Don't AoE elites unless your healer knows in advance.  Don't run away with aggro, make a beeline to the tank.  Some of them get tunnel visioned in the tab/sunder game. If your tank is moderately competent (has skills learned, isn't trying to change weapons in the middle of a run to one he's 15/300 in, waits for healer mana) you won't pull aggro unless you overlevel/gear them or you get a crazy string of crits.
---
lol paladins have a crazy amount of survivability
---
Ah. Stuck to WRA and MG so I didn't notice it that much. But yeah, I agree with the statement.
---
A drastic oversight on their part because now their name is an embarrassment because of their shit talk. Though I seriously doubt anything would have changed because they would still need 40
---
I did not play on private servers. I did play in vanilla. I did not believe MC would be cleared week 1. 
---
Massive grats to all concerned!
---
THE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE THAT BLIZZARD REFUSE TO FIX
---
Oh lol, and they thought they could beat private server users? Lol
---
What a joke.
---
Maybe but if you put both classic Rag and mythic G'huun in front of a group of let's say world 300 players with no knowledge of the boss and w/e gear is necessary. Which boss dies first?
---
Answer is Rag and I'd say in less than 10 pulls.
---
Boss difficultly has increased so much over the years it isnt even funny.
---
man I remember raiding in tbc/wotlk was still a pain in the ass due to internet issues with even smaller raid groups.
---
Dungeons on retail reminds me of the dungeons in TBC, small convenient dungeons that are designed for speed-running and emblem farming.
---
Meanwhile all the vanilla dungeons feels like real places and part of the game. 
---
Thank you for being kind and respectful.
---
Or the "In before private server people realize the real game wasn't as easy."
---
I think the community will become more rp focused as time goes on, but currently you won’t find much “unorganized rp”. I have about 40 hours, and although I’ve seen others RP in organized settings I’ve yet to spontaneously generated rp. 
---
The chat is very much the same to a normal PvP server, but I feel on RP servers you can choose to find a good guild to RP with if you want. 
---
It’s normal wow, but with a better avenue to see RP happening, or potentially get involved.
---
As a non RP player I think it adds a fun element to be around!
---
Was just playing and yeah this happened :&lt;
---
How long did it stay down last time?
---
Looks like a game of cat and mouse.
---
Draenei crash into Pandaria and they all die.
---
Not related but fun fact, a pug of randoms got world first in Destiny 2 once or twice. “Pros” aren’t always the best
---
Yeah i was just online and the whole server RIP'd
---
I don‘t know why people are mad about this. Its in the game, everybody who wants to race to 60 can use it and its not against the terms of usage. I have no Problem with it
---
yeah same was 3/4 bosses down
---
Double the debuff slots sure helps
---
Is there an OCE wow discord?
---
To be fair, I got absolutely roasted in my first classic dungeon experience ever in deadmines. I happened to aggro a group by accident (Cookie if I’m not mistaken) since it was my first time ever playing through it and the tank lost his shit when we died because of it.
---
I apologized numerously but he still couldn’t let go of the fact that I got us killed and was persistently toxic towards me the entire dungeon after that, telling me to go hide in a corner or constantly criticizing me for the mistakes that I applogized for. 
---
Ruined my classic fun steak for sure and I get extremely anxious whenever I run the dungeon now. I know this isn’t the case for everyone, but just thought I’d share since everyone’s classic experience isn’t amazing.
---
Vanish not resetting boss instantly if used within the spellbatching window?
---
French short for Ragnaros :)
---
For guild meetings, there's an empty hall or something in the Dwarven District tucked in the corner that I never see anyone around.
---
mate you’re cooked
---
nice link..
---
4-5 hours or so.
---
My too. Has been stuck looting for a bit now so I’m guessing like the last few times the world is about to break
---
Yeah hit 22 yesterday, how are these people cruising so hard?!
---
Reminds me of an old Oxhorn video
---
You are awesome!!
---
Dungeons have been shit ever since vanilla, they changed the design in TBC and kept it like that to the present day.
---
https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H
---
Yep tweeted them already like many others im sure lol. They need to switch servers to a different data centre.
---
Love this description.
---
But then people won't spam him with donations to make jokes about him balding. I'm sure once his viewers finally get over the fact that he's balding, he'll either already be bald or he'll shave it then for the publicity.
---
If he shaves now, then that cuts the incentive for people to spam donations about him balding.
---
Give me a supervisor
---
Is this for real? Wow I‘m happy if I make it to 20 today.
---
Nobody knows. But yeah, they're probably are using poor infrastructure. They better fix their shit or I'm not renewing my subscription.
---
Man, I wish someone had told me that 10 years ago. Took me way too long to figure out.
---
Because Method was overly confident/cocky about it and it’s not even a close contest. BFA players were also loud mouthing how Method would easily win etc and then here we are. There has been more hate and looking down upon the private servers and the guild that play them for years. And now when the final verdict is out everybody with those loud mouths has got their tail between their feet or changing the story/tone of the argument. Yes there is hate for Method around, but it stems/started from other people. Just just most things in life. I think it’s justified when people are too cocky.
---
Yo my manager wanted me to play this idk why I'm here
---
Tank in bear is fine for me if I have a healer
---
I was 58 the first time I did MC. #PaysToBeAVendingMachine
---
It's usually down for 15 mins, the worst one was about 3-4 hours
---
Dungeons ? Yes, off tank? yes, MT ? It’s not ideal but ....kinda.
---
Down down, servers are down
---
THUNDERFURY!
---
Ah shit
---
Yojamba is slowly dropping players.
---
Seems like the perfect speed running mechanic. There's a lot of mechanics that games have that get abused for various reasons (pros, speed, fun, ease). As long as it's in the game, it's fair game, since blizzard doesn't have a stance against it
---
I don't think dungeon grinding is any better then good questing or outdoor grinding for "normies" that don't have a dedicated group of mages to pull them through dungeons at insane pace. And with the current outdoor respawn rate both questing and grinding seem very doable. If you want to be fast without depending on others, download Guidelime addon and a quest guide for it on Cuese.
---
When you see this post for the 22nd time in a week
---
UPDATE: we downed those scum thanks to 4 players who made a resistance
---
What was the loot?
---
You can get attuned before 60.
---
This put a smile on my face. I'm 38 and leveled my dick off. My buddy never even got past the que. This is cool for apes but not much else.
---
why are you blaming someone for how their face looks in a screenshot?
---
Have you been to the land of Herod? Where you join queue before you go to work and nine hours later you're still not in?
---
Yeah, I am not arguing it was hard. It was really easy, but launch was kind of a mess when it came to raiding. We also spent like first 4 weeks of MC waiting for hours for GMs to fix our raid instances. Basically every week people were put to different raid instances, and GM had to reset them correctly. I dont remember that we would have had a single week of raiding without at least several game breaking bugs.
---
Rogue or Hunter (or Druid) for wPvP, solo gameplay and blowing ppl up? And why.
---
Vanilla great
---
TBC = Shit
---
Wrath = dogshit
---
Cata = really shit, but PvP was fun I guess
---
MoP = best of the modern WoW
---
WoD = dogshit
---
Legion = okay
---
BFA = no opinion, don't care
---
There is a great staff from a wailing caverns quest. It's from a chain quest that starts with "forgotten pools" or so.ething in the barrens.
---
15 sub-60s, they went to UBRS to get gear afterwards, yet people still say Feral Druids can’t DPS MC.
---
That's brill right? I love the undead starting place. I feel like it goes fast, I got 12 in 6 hours
---
Are raid bosses easier in classic? I think that the challenge is gearing, not the actual fight?
---
Laughs in Yojamba
---
My life has neither
---
I would suggest you think really hard about *why* you want that.
---
Right now, queues plus layering mean that population out in the world is pretty standardised across servers. Logging onto Herod doesn't mean you'll see tons more people versus Old Blanchy.
---
It does mean however that in a post-layering world you're going to be competing very heavily for finite resources (and are likely to run into regular queues). People get FOMO and feel the nerd to zerg on the most popular servers but really it's just not a good idea.
---
If you're anxious about joining a "dead realm": keep in mind a Medium server today is bigger than a "Full" server from 2004.
---
No, most bosses have a mechanic that punishes no-shield tanks.
---
Alright, who made bets about how people wouldn't clear this thing within a week? Pay up boys.
---
I played Alliance back in vanilla but decided to roll Horde this time around. Getting jumped by Son of Arugal launch night is something I will not soon forget lol
---
These people don't realize plenty of APES have been playing retail though obviously not as much.
---
I watched Monkeynews stream during beta and you'd have random idiots shitting on him about how he wouldn't do well in the ohsohard retail Arena, and he'd log into his retail character and show a bunch of arena achivements.
---
Nah, he still has to kill the raptors
---

---
You understand that he has discord muted for stream right?
---
No one is upset by it, the only ones are are those at /r/wow but they are all super bitter anyway
---
Dont see why you guys are complaining. They are using the same servers they used from 2004, of course its going to crash. Just embrace the classic experience
---
Well it has 4 major mechanics that the raid cares about really:
---
Air phase where primarily ranged dps must bring it to p3
---
Fireballs during air which if the raid is not sufficiently spaced can cause multiple deaths and possibly a wipe
---
Pseudo-random(?) Deep breaths at various positions while in the air which require raid positioning awareness
---
P3 fear + erupting crack damage, can kill melee, can chain into kicks into pits and domino into wipes.
---
This ignores what the tank needs to do for positioning, fears, transitions, wing buffet threat.
---
The mechanics of these fights did not get complicated until roughly AQ.
---
It's just a different game knowing each of the fights and how they operate 
---
Blizzard should be considering creating new classic content rather than just re releasing BC or else people are going to get bored and peace out
---
I believe the staff of ogrimmar is from the [hidden enemies] "https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5730/hidden-enemies" quest line
---
Feel free to hit me up. We have a very active guild mainly centered around China expats but have HK, Manila, TW, VN people as well. Wechat group too.
---
Still a top post either way !
---
People were talking like how pservers got it wrong and it wouldn't be as easy in Classic. Now they're backpedaling saying, "Yeah, of course they got world first, they've had years to practice it!!"
---
It's really the least impressive world first in this history of gaming
---
They also said no to classic.
---
Nice, meanwhile on my server I just watched at least 10 alliance and horde farming together in peace at Southshore on a PVP server.
---
Not when walking in with their leveling gear. Or walking in before max lvl.
---
&gt; Must have something to do with personalities and how to races/factions are preferred by different kinds of people.
---
Perhaps you should launch a study. I think you're on to something revolutionary here.
---
And here I am at level 11 happy I just got bear form I 100% will never use
---
Because it wasnt that pretty. Thank god for being allowed to run the max settings in classic XD
---
I knowwwww 😢
---
No way, I've levelled 3 characters to 60 back in the day. I just wanna blow through this first character before I have to go away from my computer on September 7
---
They're probably butt hurt at how much attention it's getting. I'd imagine quite a lot of people playing BFA swapped over.
---
I was admittedly surprised to see it week one.  Not because it would be hard - everyone has known the strats for over a decade so I figured as soon as some guild summoned him, he would go down that day.  I was just figuring that people would forget about the quintessence, go in and kill early bosses, and forget that you need those bosses for a rep quest chain to get the stuff to summon Domo. But I also wasn't really factoring in private server groups, because that's never really been a thing on my radar.
---
Anyway, grats to them.
---
Addons are third party programs you download and install that change the game in a limited functionality. For example one addon makes it so quest objectives appear on your map, making them easy to find.
---
Really insightful! Thanks a ton for the info on this
---
I've enjoyed the shit out of hitting almost every person I come across in the barrens with my arcane intellect buff.
---
Legend, thanks man.
---
He's only been growing with no decline in sight lol.
---
He's consistently pulling 50k-70k viewers. I don't think that's the sign of someone on the down and out.
---
You could make thw competition about having the shortest /played
---
Did it reset now? And now there’s a mad que. love this game 😑
---
Yeah, ahh, yojamba's down too...
---
I'm logged on Yojamba still and there's a few people in LFG. No idea what's going on.
---
Monkeynews doesnt have voice chat on in that clip, you just hear him
---
This, can't remember which of the wailing caverns quests gets you it but it's called the crescent staff and its amazing
---
Ok they are attacking Oggrimar soon arent they.
---
this. stalling on load screen.
---
just gonna sit at char select til it's confirmed up
---
I think we can say, they could have and would have. It would just have been a bit harder.
---
They 100% would if the guild played Classic and put in the effort.
---
Dungeon grinding is worth it if you have a skilled group. If your tank is having an issue tanking a single mob, then no.
---
All oce is down.
---
Yeah except I played with no issue on day one got to level 20 leveled my professions etc, they my friends get sick of queuing and roll on yojamba. Ok time to make a new character waste another 8 hours getting to the same point. Oh now Yojamba is full so my other friends who decided to start a couple of days started on Felstriker, time to do it all over again...
---
My so mean? I always liked draenei :(
---
The queues wont get better, 12 hour queues on the day BWL launches? Count me out.
---
Play the game? They're on a PvP server for a reason.
---
The game isn't supposed to be farming a casino like BFA has made you think.
---
Sydney
---
Looks like you have some good advise here. PM me your server and faction. If I can I will mail you a little gold
---
But more importantly, what was the LOOT?
---
All oce is down
---
People get so bothered by other people’s political choices. Like the guy about a hat thats red and has white lettering on it.
---
You're right!
---
Do you know if they ever give out free game time for stuff like this? or is that not a thing?
---
Nice to see the ally side is getting along. Meanwhile horde side is being hypocritical towards eachother. And everyone is getting mad at eachother for the way they play. I can’t go 5 feet without getting /spit at.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Don't let them drag you back down. Go for the gold, mate.
---
This is retarded, im so dissapointed, reached level 30 and can't FD trap
---
There is a pvp event today in Noggenfogger. Southshore vs Tarren Mill.
---
retard
---
Honestly, BWL wasn't much harder, but it definitely has a few annoyances. Capes being required is the most annoying part. Expect to see next week if people start gearing up for bwl that people will be doing ony with a LOOOOOOOOT less people and in more groups.
---
If we knew then what we know now, the first stop would just be the hp stat check of lashlayer(can he instagib your tank with flask?) and maybe thrash dragonbreath of the following drakes. We have the addons that allowed pugs and randoms to clear the rest and well written strats and a better idea on how warrior threat from shouts work.
---
Gratz, You've completed the game u can quit now.
---
Honestly I think the game is better with competitions being adhoc rather than baked in. Competitiveness and gamification is everywhere, I'd like my rpg experiences to be free of that. Not everything needs to be fucking work in order to be worthwhile.
---
What about all your friends who were playing on the server you rolled on?
---
Why would you make that up?
---
Fuck sake 3 hour in que and the server is down. Are oce players going to get compensated in sub time for this? We are having so much fucking issues
---
But they aren't. They are literally just streaming an event of various players/streamers some of which going for world firsts. Like Kenny for example who almost got server first 60 and rag. 
---
It's not like it was a whole guild of method players going hard on the same server to get a world first..
---
what is calling him out going to do anyways?
---
How'd ya do shadowfang keep? Group of five running through the horde area? Seems like you'd get attacked and die a lot?
---
[https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BiodegradableGiganticBass-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BiodegradableGiganticBass-mobile.mp4)

Yeah, and now we'll all go back to BFA so it has more than 10 players again! Let's go, guys!
---
You can draw.

He doesnt even get invited

Orc starting zone recipie is a food with a chance to kill you
---
No place for the weak

---
That's nice. As a level 17 warrior I got killed 3x in a row by a level 18 murloc before giving up.... he was non-elite
---
&gt; Go. To. A. New. Server.
---
Not easy when you have IRL friends who have their IRL friends who have their IRL friends etc. For me, it's almost impossible to move because of friend groups.
---
Normal sized raid group find a new slant
---
I had to invite a priest who buffed me on my warrior so i could bloodrage-battle shout :)
---
Already had multiple runs with DPS warriors in first or second place on details.
---
No one gives a shit except the elitists.
---
Yup. People always talk about how Classic is all about community, and yet the Classic community, especially pserver community, is one of the most toxic communities.
---
Does anyone know what techniques they use to fanr their gold? It's crazy to me that they would have saleable amounts so soon.
---
60 hours for lvl 27? Im at like 25 hours for a lvl 22 and thats with pissing around getting flightpoints and only 2 VC runs.
---
It's not a proximity voice chat. You have to form a chat group and invite people to the group to use it. I've only ever used it once and it was set up by my friend so I don't remember exactly how to do it.
---
To be honest I’d say it’s highly unlikely. Even though people have bought retail subs to access Classic, they’ll likely tell us to shove it because we have a retail sub not classic, and classic is just a bonus that we get from the retail sub (which hasn’t had any issues) 
---
They probably expected this many screw ups and used this as a technical loop hole imo
---
You'd imagine people hyped for Classic would be mature, guess I am wrong.
---
What????? Really?!
---
You basically stack AoE, pull 20+ mobs and AoE them down, you do the entire of Lib in like 4 or 5 pulls, arms in like 6. It's about 35k an hour with randoms, 25k an hour with bad groups.
---
You can also do it in a 10 man but you're dancing a fine line as ~37k/hr is 12 minute clears and you only get 5 lockouts an hour.
---
It's not fixed yet
---
No ques on Smolderweb PvP, great community too. Feel free to stop by. :)
---
I've got two two level twelves but I also work in hospitality. RIP playtime.
---
Actually in now
---
It goes up by 5 every level.  Press K to see your skills
---
Where is the clip where Sco said that private server guilds are not a issue for them?
---
Exactly, so they wouldn't do it exactly like this. Probably have had to change a few classes around to make it work.
---
Grasping at straws lmao, face it the hardest part of Vanilla was never the raids or dungeons. Retail is king of raid and dungeon difficulty.
---
Aoe mage farm.
---
Osrs legitimately has much harder bossing content though
---
Nice, way to put them in the perfect position to always be right. If they win, well of course we did we're Method, we're the best guild lul. If they lose, sarcasm BTW, we didn't mean it you're all autistic for believing us lul
---
we in
---
I don't get it man: people wanted WoW Classic right? Ok, they wanted the TRUE 2005 vanilla experience, so blizzard gave it to them 99 % accurate. But then everybody goes into this mad frenzy to level up to 60 as fast as possible, for some reason by following online guides and joining "mass cleave aoe groups" to farm xp by taking advantage of layering. Isn't this exactly the opposite of living like in 2005 WoW ? Idk man, people are robbing themselves of the experience they wanted all along
---
PServer sometimes advertise with their tighter boss tuning. Especially WotLK Nax was a joke, when it was released.
---
They are the Borg. Resistance is futile.
---
What a horrible nightmare, that sounds like a sure fire way to get negative growth.
---
Daddy likes leather.
---
Nah, the water looks shit.
---
Congrats, they know how to abuse layering gg
---
Hah sorry should of made it clearer, I was pointing out the Tip: *'take screenshots with &lt;Print Screen&gt;' .*  
---
Seems relevant on this sub.  
---
Ps- IM IN
---
Go train your skills.
---
sfa%
---
Don't play then.
---
Alliance shouldn't go to Stonetalon
---
righto broseph
---
Getting a something wrong due to misinformation isn't the same as making up a random fact. 
---
Yes they killed Rag
---
Yes they had plenty of raid members who were not lvl 60
---
I got the part that over half were under 60 wrong. My bad, but don't assume I liked to get internet clout 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Very Nice
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Console_variables/Complete_list
---
Not if all of them work at classic, though.
---
There's whispers that some of them were sharing accounts with others to play while they slept.
---
They literally don't even have a guild in classic wow how the fuck are they racing for anything? They have like 7 members playing.
---
Big dick guild

Well in a democracy it’s not unusual for other people’s political opinions to result in policy that directly negatively impacts you if they are on the other side of the aisle, so I think it’s actually pretty normal to react to a differing political opinion.

---
Out of curiosity what makes it so bad? Haven't kept up with the lore in a while but Sylvanas has consistently been my favorite character in warcraft by a longshot.
---
You should definitely try the main retail version of the game, despite what everyone says about battle for azeroth it's still pretty fun and seeing your complaints, you would enjoy it far more than classic.
---
Duskwood worgens
---
I´m in queue.
---
I dont see the point in playing a classic server only to rush to the end content. May as well just stick to the usual servers and it’s do everything quick as possible outlook. I played wow on release and the magic was everything just seemed so big and you could just explore areas without being bothered by doing things as fast as possible. That’s what old wow means to me. I get people have other goals. But they are missing out on the whole point of having a classic server.
---
World first was over a decade ago
---
Lore wise.. The draenei pretty much screwed everything up by just... existing.. lol
---
Haven't kept up with wow lore in a while, why does it suck?
---
You'll be sitting in queue with more people
---
Full layers will host the same # of players
---
I would rather push a new player to retail than  suffer and remain in classic with the gripes they have. Instead of the alternative of never playing wow again. Our community has been toxic for too long and we should welcome new players to either version.
---
They are in ungoro now.
---
What level are you? :-))
---
I've barely touched retail since bfa came out. I'm just not blind to both versions flaws and strengths like you.
---
Yes it was, for Mc at least.
---
Probably because you have to handle 40 lootwhores who don't have the willpower and unit cohesion like the guys in APES have.
---
Everybody wants loot and fast, but only 3 items drop per boss and often items like Vendorstrike that are terrible.
---
Now you have to sometimes humour an unwilling crowd so they dont just say:"Screw you guys, I'm going home", but stick to their guns.
---
Raids aren't terribly engaging, so killing the same bosses in MC for a chance for ToEP, Onslaught and bindings while the rest gets disenchanted or given to the 3rd alt all while you are progressing in Naxxramas can be quite draining.
---
Now you add benchwarmers, resistance and consumable farming etc. on top of that and it can become quite a chore to lead that crowd.
---
tl;dr the social aspect is the hard part of classic raiding, not the mechanics within the raid.
---
I have known of people who were really close (relationship kinda thing) met irl and ended up hating each other . I'm still very skeptical of online relationships tbh. Friendships is w/e, sure you can talk to people over the headset about life and whatnot,but you never know what people are truly like till you meet them. This online friendship stuff ties into the fantasy of wow. It's pretty much a fantasy and you create your friends based on that fantasy and what they give you.
---
You wouldn't be playing with your driends if they were totally bad and holding you back from progressing raids etc. So thats why video game friendships are largely artificial to me. You have to connect outside of the game for it to be truly meaningful , and if you do that it can be something special
---
Still haven't decided what race/class I will be playing.
---
n o H a I R
---
That's my plan but I'm only 28 and most are 28 aswell. Wouldn't they be too hard for aoe?
---
Grobbulus only had like a 5 minute queue for me at peak today.
---
yeah on onyxia.. most died on ragnaros and they didn’t use consumables after that
---
But this is stupid, they can't be the broadcaster for the race to 60 or the raid world firsts because they can't rebroadcast other streamers content or even report on it in a way which is more helpful than just browsing twitch on your own. What's the point? They even went to commercial during the very moment the guy got world first 60, what kind of broadcast is that?
---
If they tried to cash in on this with clickbait and switch titles then I hope it's backfired, it seems lots of people have a lower opinion of them after this than going into it after their quite good retail race streams.
---
Holy Nova is not great, you won't aoe farm well.
---
Spec spirit tap, wand spec, get a good wands. Shield, mind blast, swp, wand until mob dies or mb is up again, repeat to 60. It has little downtime, priests are fine levelers. It might feel slow though. Continue speccing shadow. At 40 Respec for shadowform and 41+ get wand spec again.
---
Mind flay does very little damage for the Mana you spend (and the Mana you don't regen because you cast), your wand is going to be comparable unless it's really outdated.
---
Farming lashers is something you can do with Holy Nova once you get a big manapool. Mostly because lashers are weak, less because Holy Nova is good.
---
No reason to really, I'm not looking for a New MMO. I mostly wanted to see what I missed by not playing WoW when I was like 10.
---
I like you. I hope you're enjoying classic.
---
Whats up with Aussie servers, they are always down in Runescape too.
---
Maybe you should too :) Chastising someone who gets a very small and quite insignificant fact wrong, doesn't do anything, literally nothing. So congratulations for being the brave soul to take on the burden of arguing with a stranger on the internet because they're wrong.
---
I mean, why do you care though?
---
I'm level 24 right now. The fact that 50 people with zero life who spend 8+ hours a day every single day playing WoW can kill Ragnaros easily is kinda pointless.
---
The difference is really the dungeon farming, much better than on pservers. That's about it.
---
gnomes have nice racials for caster dps, +15 to engineering, and a snare escape; all in all a pretty well rounded race
---
rofl k, that's it.  Gamers have EVOLVED!
---
They're using the same strats.  Nice try though.  They're staring intensely at the screen and that's making them do more damage.  You figured it out!
---
As someone who also didn't play the game back then, I'm really enjoying my experience (minus the servers being garbage). It's ok that the game isn't for everyone, it came from an era when games were played by gamers, not by everyone. Retail WoW still exists and is more geared to your demographic if you're a casual player. If you don't like PVP, don't play a PVP server, if you don't like a grindy hard game, play retail over Classic.
---
A lot of your points are speculation or anecdotal, but the player numbers and feedback speak for themselves. I think classic is going great (again except for the incompetence with regards to servers)
---
love waiting in a 3 hour queue for servers to go down just as i get in
---
Nobody cares
---
I laughed way harder than I should have at this. Damn dad humor, take my upvote.
---
That's really interesting had no clue
---
Prepare for a lot of that in Classic. Anyone who started playing Classic to experience "epIC rAIDing aNd HarD pvE" will be very disappointed.
---
Easy to say afterwards when you got beat hard
---
I probably spent an hour grinding around looking for Pygmy spiders in Duskwood lol. I'll check out redridge and wetlands next. Thx.
---
Get in a guild. It was always like this.
---
Dont got any problem even getting on full server , max. 30min que
---
Should I level my priest with holy or shadow? Tbh I primarily kill mobs with my wand rn.
---
Sounds more like people are intentionally jumping to the conclusion that they are racing because it fits their narrative that big organisation is bad. 
---
I don't care much for method, but they made a really cool event and had a sick stream to show for it.
---
You only need eight. The first eight people to hit 60 start farming elementals for rep and get to honored, then pick up the first MC quest. After completing that, they hearth to Ashenvale and quickly go to Azshara to turn in and get the hands quest, then get summoned back to the raid, do that quest, go back to Azshara, pick up their quints, and then they kill Rag.
---
Sure if you write the whole process yourself or at least modify it. Otherwise it will detect you using known devices
---
neither is classic
---
I’m confused... can anyone explain?
---
You do realize method trains on the test realms for all the stuff right?  Hell, there have even been times blizzard has nerfed his after method couldn't down it after so many tries.  You are putting one on a pedestal and shaming the other when they are literally the same. 
---
To not be impressed when practice makes for precise implementation is ridiculous.
---
The layer jumping is a mini game in itself. It's so awful. This isn't vanilla. It's something different.
---
I'm here, didn't say it was impossible but I argued that it was very unlikely. I eat my words, these guys are fucking insane!
---
Lol, sick name.
---
Most were 60...
---
It was always DM for us back in the day. I don’t remember anyone doing the whole of Dire Maul in a single sitting(at least we weren’t) it was always a wing.
---
Layering is an intended feature.
---
When did I imply exploit=cheat? If anything you did when you literally said 'Compared to vanilla wow, yeah it's kind of cheating.' Are you just trying to retroactively walk that comment back when its quite clearly in this comment chain?
---
What do you even mean no longer comparable? They were never ever going to be remotely comparable as runs. Even suggesting that him using layering is specifically what makes it not comparable is just silly.
---
Also, you do seem to be giving a fuck since you're replying so much. You can't whinge about it being cheated and ineligible this much and think you still have the 'idk lol' card left to play haha
---
BWL started out much harder than anything before it.
---
Razorgore really got the raid leaders to realize just how many scrubs they had in their guild! Oh boy...
---
If your guild was good enough to bring down both Razor and Vael, then it was good enough to clear out the rest without **too** much trouble, I think.
---
You're right though. I don't think the guilds today will be having as much trouble as we did back in the day. :)
---
Ah well... it was a fun time for me. But I only have time to watch from the sidelines this time around.
---
And most of them will be bored in 3 months tops.
---
dungeon raids
---
Make a macro to put a skull on the one you want targeted and tell them.
---
I love how everyone always said "But but joana time is the FASTEST everyone has EVER leveled". Like what? If people are expecting to clear records unprecedented in classic don't you think the leveling record is the very first one to go?!
---
I think this might be what you're looking for. 
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24980-QuestLogEx.html
---
Exactly.
---
He was using the Nicker.
---
Must be our internet over here. Our best internet is equivalent to the rest of the worlds garbage internet
---
We're not just talking about Ony here, and what four of the best players with the best gear did in a very precise and mechanically flawless effort isn't comparable to a boss that has been weakened repeatedly directly and indirectly a decade and a half later in gear that's ten+ levels under max level.
---
As plenty of people have been saying on this subreddit for months. All the vanilla raids are easy enough to be cleared by most specs, the one thing that might not be possible is clearing aq/naxx with a prot pally whos actually tanking on bosses. Since there simply is no gear they can use.
---
Ret pallys can use warrior gear, feral druids and enha shamans can use rogue gear, ele shamans, shadow priests and balance druids can use mage gear.
---
Best way to avoid this is, get a guide addon like Guidelime and one of the guides made for it, that way you can be sure to get the right quests in the zone and have an efficient route. I can't quest without it for the same reason, I have limited time to play and don't want to spend hours aimlessly searching for quests or backtracking because I forgot something.
---
Context is important, you mean? What an astute idea.
---
Oceanic servers were dead for about 4 hours the other day. The character select screen looked like OP's pic
---
Nobody ever said tag was hard. Let's see the last half of aq and most of naxx lol
---
DM=I could take 4-5 seconds of using my brain to figure it out
---
VC=wtf
---
Gotta cc and follow the kill order
---
Thank you all for the answers :)
---
Never touched BFA. Also great reasoning with the PvP thing and there being no honorable kills active, keep it up bud
---
Levelling speed will be slower than questing. Money wise you will probably be ok, at a guess worse than questing but maybe not.
---
Talents I would just look up a lvl 60 holy build and start along that path.
---
I've played holy paladin since vanilla right through to retail and am levelling what will be one on classic, though I'll level by questing and with ret talents (though will heal dungeons as needed) feel free to AMA.
---
I’m a noob what does GY stand for
---
What is LBRS
---
It's not abusing, it's clever use of game mechanics
---
So much nostalgia from this sub, I really want to get this game but know it will suck a lot of my time. Could never play WoW in moderation lol.
---
Super cool seeing everyone’s posts though. Excited to see BWL go down next.
---
Arguably the best class in the game
---
Hard to level alone, just party up. Survive to the endgame and experience the op power. Also gear up hard.
---
Small Indie Company
---
It's been a great time so far, hope you're loving it too :)
---
&gt; Warriors are definitely S tier, but no tank can hold AoE threat and take the hits from multiple mobs quite like a Druid.
---
Right now, sure.
---
But wait untill the warriors start getting raid gear, Battle Shout spam and wearing the BWL shield will take care of both aoe threat and damage mitigation.
---
They're in that APES guild dude. It isn't just a bunch of regular dudes who took time off work. I know people who did that. They're level 34 right now. These people have most likely play wow every single day for 6+ hours like they did on private servers.
---
"You seem upset."  I love things that start this way, it lets me know right away that I'm dealing with a troll and an idiot at the same time.
---
I called it easy because what they did would not have been possible when this content was fresh.  If you've actually got something to contribute, feel free, but until then, you're just another bandwagoning tryhard scrub.
---
Yes... what explanation do you want? 
---
Play 24 hours, sleep 4-6 hours, play 24 hours etc... 
---
get a group of 10 people and hard farm instances to power level
---
No.
---
SUF is available, yes. I just set it up yesterday even though I told myself I'd stick with the classic UI but SUF looks so nice that I could not resist.
---
You pvp because the entire raiding scene sucks balls. It was too easy on private servers and on classic it's way easier according to the apes members. So yeah, looking forward to phase 2.. or rather phase 3 when proper pvp begins I guess.
---
And a whole 5 seconds of  latency!
---
Yeah sure, if you find normal raids hard in retail, AQ and Naxx will be challenging
---
Think when they guy says posts he means comments. I see tons of comments but no posts.
---
It's an even better when you go to bed after preparing and leveling profs. Set an AH with the bi-products and wake up to 5ish gold in the mail. 😶
---
For me the appeal of classic is that it’s an actual rpg and not some arena pvp wanna be esports or rush to max level raid game. I enjoy questing and seeing the world.
---
Method FanBoi for sure. Money does not mean everything.
---
Hate crime.
---
Did everyone forget that people have been playing vanilla private servers for over a decade? This just another weekend for them
---
I am! It's kinda difficult Haha but a load of fun.
---
Classic isnt hardcore. Its just ultra long and time wasting. The other mmorpgs of vanilla time were much harder
---
Taking a week off really isn't outlandish.
---
May I ask why you are levelling holy and not ret?
---
Was lucky I got it at 25. It’s a q chain that ends in SW library. Can’t remember where is starts tho :(
---
People in the world first rag kill in vanilla had DM gear? Interesting.
---
Everyone is probably out questing.
---
25?! No life!
---
when 60lvl gamks you it is not fun.

It's an entire thread saying it's possible, can you read?
---
Wrong. It depends on the server. Greymane US used VC
---
Dude? The Game is Not Even a week released. Can you just enjoy it?
---
Sure. But the bottomline is this week in Classic has been the most social and friendly time I've had in an MMO since vanilla.
---
&gt;Vanilla isn't about downing Ragnaros. I spent all last night ganking people, my friends are doing Deadmines, and so on. It's completely irrelevant that someone killed ragnaros.
---
Yeah, and all those elements are greatly diminished in TBC, so what you are left with is a much more hollow version of the game.
---
&gt;They should release TBC because it's a great expansion.
---
They shouldn't, because its a mistake that cannot be undone.
---
Pve no. Pvp solo yes, in a group no, bgs depends how you play it
---
If I had friends to have over this would probably be me.
---
Well obviously theyd beat Jokerd. He used it only the last 2 levels... Imagine him using it with a dedicated group or even guild like APES. 
---
I wouldnt be proud to beat a solo player as a whole guild. Awesome accomplishments of APES with the raids tho.
---
There're a lot of perks with frost. That shield increases your survivability. You can do a lot of PvP and farming, which won't be so easy if you're a fire mage.
---
Those who actually played WoW 15 years ago or near that time knew it would be done in under a week. Those who said it would take longer were either trolling you, straight up lying, or had absolutely no understanding of how the mechanics of classic WoW worked.
---
Yesterday I was running around western barrens and accidentally aggroed some rare hyena. I ran away with fear of dying and regret that I am not a hunter.

Don't worry, when you get to 20 your skills will be 20s a piece.

What does that have to do with anything?

Also warlock, this is accurate.
---
Preach to him brother.
---
I'm still waiting on Amy Schumer to move to Canada...
---
at least when you die in maplestory the town is like a minute away, tracking 13 minutes back into a dungeon where adds are starting to spawn is absolute shit
---
Honestly, Ony looks interesting. Standing on the walls works again. Her threat table seems very finnicky. And the deep breaths actually work.  APES was losing chunks of people to them. 
---
Also she actually flies up and down this time, she doesn't just walk into the sky like on Nost.
---
I actually think this is terrible for the game, great accomplishment for them, no doubt.  If you are the type that always wanted to experience how hard classic was and the grind and sense of accomplishment from the work it took, seeing the bosses drop in 5 days is pretty disheartening.
---
As fast as you want. Everyone levels differently.
---
He had 330k viewers at the last levels, chat was totaly out of control, subs and twitch primes were coming nonstop, so I think he made more $ than method and asmongold combined on that night.
---
it boggles my mind, too
---
same boat, dont know what that dude is on about
---
Hey this is on KroMcRibs has!!
---
You realize you can just keep playing vanilla, right?
---
Suit yourself, i just want to do Karazhan with my friends, i'll still play vanilla so I don't really know why it affects your experience.
---
Hunter is a fairly unique class that's very easy and also fairly fun. However, you can only DPS, no taking or healing. Paladans are also very easy, and can heal, DPS, and (sorta in the early game) tank, however paladins are very boring.
---
Same! It felt a little undeserving since I was permanently oom on my druid, but then again, it got significantly better with the new staff so at least it was worth it! 
---
We didn't down Van Cleef though. Guess we're not material for this guild!
---
Rag is a specific exception. Ragnaros and Onyxia were way too weak. Blizz developers tested these themselves back in the day. Blizz developers are/were very bad players. They took weeks to clear even just one boss in MC. Then they released it and it was cleared almost instantly.
---
After this professional testers were hired.

Not really.

Just imagining an undead spitting on someone like some kind of Viper spitting poison. Tilts its head back and it's like "TTSSS"
---
I mean, anyone practicing shit for years will be better than people going into it blind without videos and tutorials to help them know what to do and where to stand.
---
Hows that possible, when yesterday the first Person Hit 60?
---
They’re different skill sets, so no, not really.  Yeah Method is incredible at what they primarily do, but what they primarily do isn’t what they were really doing here.  
---
The people with *dramatically* more experience doing what was being done here (90% leveling in Vanilla, 5% MC preparation and 5% actually doing MC) were always the smart favorites to win the competition.  Particularly if APES actually formally practiced power leveling, which I imagine they did given their ludicrous pace, but I don’t know.
---
Yes! Dive in. There isn’t a better time to start playing than now because we’re all starting from the beginning. You’ll be able to learn and enjoy at your own pace without feeling like you’re missing out on anything.
---
Can't upload a screenie from the phone from the toilet
---
What's the "oof" part of this? He's not exactly wrong, they generally are the best at the game in terms of skill.
---
Thank you for the explanation.
---
The content in general is noticeably easier than on private servers. I've noticed in dungeons how you can just derp your way through. Yesterday I was trying to put together a group for SM cathedral and couldn't find anyone who wanted to tank, but there was a warrior LFG as DPS so I just invited him and we simply did the instance without a tank. 
---
Breezed through with utter ease, I barely had to drink and could spend most of my time DPSing despite being the healer. Everyone was level 38 which is fucking four levels below the boss. We just mowed through without a care in the world. No CC, no careful pulls, just fucking party-crashed the place as essentially five DPS. 
---
The same has been the case for all the other dungeons I've done as well. Mobs just don't seem to hit very hard. It's like private servers had everything tuned at +30% and we simply didn't remember it being any different back in the day.
---
This needs more upvotes, because this saved me a ton of time. Killed him twice and didn't know why the claw wasn't dropping. Talking to Senani again saved me, thank you man!
---
Classic is not difficult (i.e. it doesn't require skill), it's just time consuming.
---
If the hardest content in retail is 100/100, then the hardest content in classic is like 20/100.  Classic raids are mostly braindead and just require lots of grinding to be able to get to them.
---
I'm not really sure mmo, as a genre, are really the thing for you if you can barely stand to interact with people for 25 minutes. One of the aspects people loved the most about vanilla wow was that it forced you, organically, to interact and work with other players on your server to overcome challenges the game presented to you.
---
I guess I'm sorry nobody ever explained this to you? It's a core tenet of classic wow design, one which has been marginalized through the history of wow expansions and why there was such demand for this rerelease of sorts.
---
Ditto, priest &amp; hunter both level 11. Really enjoying going slowly.
---
For international avoid the American based airlines. Service and quality is much higher on any other countries airlines pretty much.  Worst tho was Hawaiian Air from Hawaii to Japan.  Those planes 10 years behind.
---
&gt;You realize you can just keep playing vanilla, right?
---
Guess what, you can still play TBC on retail as well, Outland is more or left untouched and all the raids besides Zul Aman is still available.
---
&gt;Suit yourself, i just want to do Karazhan with my friends, i'll still play vanilla so I don't really know why it affects your experience.
---
Because all the zones die out because the entire game is centered around Outlands?
---
they've already done this dozens upon dozens of times on private servers
---
You are completely normal. According to Blizzard 70% quit in the first week. Since it's also known many quit at 40, I'm guessing less than 20% ever reach 60. This means it's we who continue to play the game that are the wierdos.
---
16, 2-4 a day. /played is like 15hr I think
---
If you are good with the grind and have a sense of adventure. I say give the game a try.
---
No i agree i enjoyed pvp alot more before all that happened :/
---
If you dont like world pvp then dont join a pvp server is my opinion.
---
Tarren mil vs southshore is considered some of the games best memories so why ruin it?
---
Ventrilo for us at least
---
Ahh, but you see, the profession list is still there. 🙂 I've spent hours trying to get low level cooking recipes even before the achievements system was implemented in Wotlk.
---
There is a Smite spec, does decent damage early without gear and can be used for leveling, in this spec that would be the best opener. But no, it isn't a great spell or anything.
---
And that's the main quest.

Thats super awesome. Hoping I can find irl connections one day to WoW. When i was younger people in school used to play online games together but as i grew older they stopped playing games and I kinda lost that feeling. Good for you tbh.
---
if you want a game full of safety nets to make sure nothing goes wrong and everything gets done no matter what as long as you throw some hours into it.. retail is still right there. go do your weekly mythics and farm neck lvls.

I tried it like 5 years ago briefly to level 13 and to get to level 13 literally took me like 2 hours. i think it took me 12+ hours to get to 13 on classic. albeit, classic experience. but clearly there are more optimizations that people talk about.
---
Why play that trash when you can play classic
---
It's definitely from the tailor trainer, at like level 125
---
What?!? No!
---
Classic good, all others bad!
---
Oh boy, do you happen to have a string for this?
---
Deep breaths weren't really a giant issue back then but they got blind sided with the fact the boss 'actually works' rofl. Which was kind of funny. They're gonna have to remember to do one of the two things that were a problem!
---
Mhm, especially profession leveling. In retail A: why bother before max level and B: it's mostly just grinding up making a bunch of worthless stuff, running to the AH for more mats, make some more worthless stuff, realize you didn't quite get enough mats and repeat. 
---
In classic the stuff you craft as you level up is actually helpful. You fight for every point you gain. Going to the ah is still an option, but you're not swimming in so much gold that it doesn't matter, you need to weigh the priority of picking up some profession levels of ranking up that spell that you don't use super often but is still useful. Suddenly I realize I've been in undercity for 40 minutes working on my crafting and optimizing between making the most useful things, getting skill ups, and efficient use of materials.
---
Aye sure next time change it. 
---
But I think fucking with a system that tens of thousands of people are using on any given server has the potential to lead to things that ruin gameplay. Where as these people being slightly higher in level than they normally would be isn't effecting my gameplay at all.
---
Layering will be gone soon enough and then we won't ever have to deal with concerns with it again. It's just a temp thing that helps the servers out. It's more than worth a few people exploiting.
---
Imagine thinking the actual bfa guild was playing classic
---
Exactly, love your comment!

The gatekeeping is strong with this one.

IF is empty because nobody has a reason to idle there yet. I see a ton more people in Stormwind because it's closer to the low level alliance zones that most people seem to be in. Once people start spending time in the plaguelands and blackrock mountain IF will be a lot busier.
---
really? every guide and wowhead like website says use it from 110-125?
---
Erm, how are the world's best retail guild doing right now? Where are method lol.
---
Mine has 1 hour queue rn. But I'm on shazzrath so it is alright. I knew about this when I switched over from Ten Realms.
---
You think it not but it do.
---
i mean. if it was a reply then i just saw the comment in my inbox. whether it's on the front page or not doesn't matter when I sort by new.
---
Ill bagon those lies
---
Idk but this game will be dead so fast. I give it 1 month from today
---
Leveling outside of dungeons would be practically impossible without it. Would be nice to see it disabled in certain places, though, like cities. 
---
Honestly when they do remove layering it's going to be a shit show and I'm going to love watching it.
---
The weakest ones start falling
---
 I am honestly wondering how most of them are feeling after this. 
---
*"What to do until the next challenge comes along? "*
---
*"Am I really enjoying this?"*
---
Or more like: 
---
*"What day is it?"*
---
Smolderweb.  Hilarious if it was - he was doing great besides falling into mana and burning to death
---
Those private server boys have already downed Rag and Onixya in Classic.
---
There's a big difference between practicing part of an untuned boss fight in PTR and executing a known strategy that you've done multiple times on private servers.
---
I enjoyed watching APES race, but it was pretty anticlimactic since there was no real competition and zero chance they would fail in the raids.
---
Most classic players are actually stoked for them. 
---
Wanna know something interesting. If you join into classic wow you will run into 2 types of players. The newer gen of WoW players who are toxic little fucks mainly youth, and the older gen who want nothing more than to have fun and help newer players mainly 25-35ish age range. 
---
You say gut punch but thats because you dont understand how classic WoW was 15 years ago. It was a social construct of clueless gamers helping eachother while being simultaneously shitty at the game but loving it.
---
Sure but if 10 people can do in 40 seconds what takes 5 people 5 mins then it becomes much more efficient.
---
Where is your source?
---
Not a fan of either guild personally (world first isn't interesting to me), but I'd like to see them face off on new raids nobody has been exposed to.
---
This... isn’t how it works at all. The servers are hosted there (I play on OCE from Asia for what it’s worth). The company in charge of hosting the OCE servers seems to be struggling.
---
I doubt any of those mouthbreathers would be able to finish any marathon tho :D
---
How can you do an atunement so quickly?
---
&gt; Gearing is really bad in classic, sadly.
---
All the more rewarding when you get gear.
---
I got 2 whole levels today, I did pretty good. Sitting nice at 22.
---
maybe the real goalpost is the friends we made along the way
---
Arugal Oceanic Realm (the 1st of 3 PvP) has 4K-7K queues at peak.
---
It’s a more interesting case as we only had Arugal pre-launch and then Blizzard opened 2 new realms within the first day due to 15K queues, but players are hesitant to leave Arugal as Oceanic have a history of dead realms.
---
Actually if he got far enough in the lead and stayed there he would have 0 competition. This won't happen again until they launch new servers, thus possibly making it harder in the future.
---
&gt; What you said, applies to this. Anyone can read up on it. After that it's just clicking the buttons.
---
No it doesn't. With retail there is new content you need to figure out the strats for. It's not 15 year old content. There isn't a fuckton of information about it. Guild literally go in, wipe a dozen times to a mechanic until they come up with a strat to deal with it. Then it's rinse and repeat for every new mechanic they face.
---
Yes. Method players are far more skilled than private server players. The only private server palyers who compete skill wise are the ones who raid high end mythic in retail as well. Method can easily do what APES does, APES can't easily do what Method does.
---
OP presented a fairly easy solution to an exploit that will be around for up to months(blizzlike timelines says each phase is 3-4 months and phase 2 is last call for phase removal). How is that a bad idea?
---
[Definitely DM](https://i.imgur.com/TLKbWFC.png)
---
It's not near as bad with 1.12 as the launch patch. Lot of fixes baked in that warriors didn't have on original release. Better rage gen, itemization, etc.
---
Yes. 
---
I only have time to play at night.
---
FYI, rag was much harder than on any pserver or in 1.12 on release as well.
---
Lol happened to me. I'm new to wow and had to ask area chat how to get out.
---
I highly recommend wand, and getting a Greater Magic Wand at level 13. It does a ridiculous amount of damage compared to your other options, and it costs no mana.
---
Onyxia resets in 2 hours...?
---
You're right.
---
What he's saying is, "no one is having fun unless they're refusing to optimize their playtime. Grrrr kids \*drags knuckles around on the ground\*"
---
Doesn't chanhe the fact that any boss in vanilla had piss easy mechanics compared to recent raids.
---
You owe someone all the cheese in your pocket.
---
I was sitting here wondering what was going on as someone out of the loop. This huge stream on twitch of method aiming for world firsts, meanwhile they just got blasted by this other group out of nowhere lmfao. That’s hilarious.
---
&gt;its not a game for casuals who don't have nostalgia
---
I'm pretty casual gamer, and I never played wow except for a short time in 2018. I still enjoy wow classic a lot. It's almost as if people were able to enjoy different types of things?
---
How is months "not far off" in your book? If you can easily fix a problem like OP solution does, why would you not want that in the game immediately?
---
It's like saying "oh why fix the economic crisis right now, it'll blow over in a couple years anyway no big deal"
---
&gt; These people have most likely played wow every single day for 6+ hours like they did on private servers.
---
Uh, no shit? Do you expect WFs to be done by people playing 4 hours a day?  People taking vacations to play their favorite game isn't that unexpected.
---
Bro, I've been playing MMOs since maple story release don't even patronize. MMO =/= interacting with others, it means Massive Multiplayer Online. It does not mean, hey we're all going to best friends and party together, that is a bit naive don't you think. If people are idiots, its going to show in WoW over a 60 minute+ long dungeon. I literally almost left gnomer dungeon at 65 minutes even though we were 10 minutes away from finishing. I don't mind meeting people, I dont mind joining guilds, I don't mind partying with idiots. What I do hate, is having my time wasted. And because you have to spend so long in a dungeon with people you have literally no idea how focused they are on the game or their role, how well they are paying attention, or a whole host of other things, you have a lot of time wasted. And thats why i'm frustrated. 
---
I'll keep using maple story for an example. The fun part about party quests, was doing them blindly fast. you could do 25 of them in an hour or something insane like that. and the great thing, you maybe dealt with the same people for like 3-4 quests at time so maybe 10 minutes. not an hour+
---
They've been doing it over and over for years now, why would that deter them now?
---
Can we not make posts like these, it's the same garbage that made PCMR a terrible subreddit
---
So you think you're on their level?  You aren't.
---
&gt;TBC = shit
---
Oh boy you should be careful, someone might think you're being serious
---
Lol I do this all the time just to freak lowbies out. Throw up a hunters mark while running past them and see how they react.
---
Don't need to, and don't do it. Mount at 40 helps a lot more than lots of skills.
---
It's just nostalgia, what makes you think this will offer a long lasting experience? All people wanted was vanilla servers with Blizz quality control, people have played on private servers for years, why would they make things harder if literally the only reason people play is to relive their memories? There's already too much changes, if they changed the difficulty they might as well not do classic at all.
---
No, they won't.
---
Did this for several days now on my prot pally and it's fairly easy to pull off.  
---
You let the warlock cast eye of kilrog, give it PW:S, pull everything and have someone tank it for 1-2 seconds to clump them up, then frostnova and aoe it down.
---
Alternatively you can use speed potions + bubble to pull larger packs.
---
bs
---
Fucking Goldilocks over here. This server is too hot. This server is too cold. What a whiny child. I hope you get eaten by a bear.
---
Mc attune takes literally 20 minutes.
---
Lfr was at the end of cata
---
I don't know if I'd go that far. But, it isn't even really a world first. This has happened...a thousand+times. I get the hype they're trying to generate. But even the lvl 60 thing felt ridic.  
---
It takes a bit of coordination and dedication to make this happen. But it's not like omg!    
---
Kinda cool to see again. Kinda meh. Kinda glad I just spent $40 on Anno 1800 and not 2 2/3 months of wow.
---
You’ll soon be farming Satyrs for horns in Ashenvale. You’ll see.
---
????
---
The playing field to get 60 was even. They already got beat. By a malding gnome nonetheless.
---
I mean they did that on the private servers. This is a pretty well known guild, everyone playing on private servers knows them. And there they played WoW like it was their job too.
---
How soon after launch did your guild kill Onyxia?
---
I'm happy to see other people dislike them aswell. I personally have never liked that guild and especially now with all their game studios and casters and how all top arena teams and mythic teams belong into their guild. Seeing them lose always brings a huge smile to my face for some reason
---
Joking right? To do it this fast you must know what you are doing. It's not like they have an infinite amount of time and just had more of it. Throw a random dude 5 days to level and he would still not be me MC ready.
---
Lol that was a joke he doesn't even have a brother
---
I wish it was someone...but just mor the fact that people are accomplishing things that have already been done and claiming them as if it were the first time.  just look at all the comments in the 'world first Rag' post...
---
Just let people play the game the way they want to
---
As long as the idiots don't become the majority. So many people insisting on a tank for RFC .. I made my own group and tanked it as a lock... With my imp... Shits easy man... Sure later on but RFC is Faceroll
---
The guys who did this had the timings abilities and their classes down to an art. They have killed Rag hundreds of times and recently. To compare their achievement here (which is astounding) to what is required for your first run through the raid is silly. It is like watching a professional body builder dead lift and then saying it invalidates all the work you put in at the gym. No it does not. It highlights what practice, understanding, and skill bring to the table. Just like you likely can’t not deal lift like a body builder, you likely can not clear MC without substantially more gear than these guys had.
---
I did rfc yesterday without a tank, that dungeon is a joke.
---
OP literally just purposed a fucking solution on how to fix layer abusing without removing layering could you please take one minute to read the fucking post because spreading this garbage?
---
\&gt; Why it doesn't have a lockout period is beyond me. Give it the dungeon treatment: X within 1 hour. This way in the rare instances that you group with a friend and oh no, their cat is on fire they have to log off, you still get the option to group up with your friend who doesn't leave his pet near open flames as opposed to waiting 10 minutes to go kill some Burning Steppes mobs.
---
\&gt;3 layer hops an hour is what I propose. If you for some reason need a 4th set of friends to play with within that hour, they can join your layer. Simple. At the end of the day layering isn't to make it so you can hop between rares or aoe pulls, it's so you can play together, who cares whether there's a rare mob there or if you need to wait 7 minutes for certain mob packs to respawn. Go kill other packs like the game initially intended you to do. You want your friend to come kill the rare mob with you, that can still happen too.
---
Shadow. You can still easily heall all dungeons and levelling is a lot more comfortable and I'd say fun. Just be sure to first get wand talents in Disc.
---
Kran is trying to make the argument that a boss would make less than 2 attacks in 5.0 seconds, therefore never fully consume all of the block charges, therefore never present an opportunity (even if you assume the boss attack timer got reset due to parrying) for a Warrior to be at the risk of taking an attack that could land and be a critical hit.
---
Of course even if you assume that to be true and accurate that doesn't actually 'favor' the Warrior in any way due to how probability works and the attack table and it means that quite literally every class is just as unlikely to be attacked more than twice in 5.0 seconds, which leads you to the question of how much damage your raid is capable of healing in a given period of time, or is willing to let a tank 'take' before receiving some healing. If the answer is that the raid is capable of healing more than 2 attacks worth of damage (in that window of time) then it literally made no difference as to what class you had tanking (because the worst case scenario was 2.0 attacks worth of damage). The entire point of 'mathing' out this sort of scenario (i.e. theory crafting) is to establish the risk chance (of any given event).
---
+ If your raid isn't capable of healing through 2.0 attacks worth of damage under any circumstances in a 5.0 second window of time then you have no option for anything but a Warrior.
---
+ If your raid is capable of healing through 2.0 attacks worth of damage in a 5.0 second window of time then you can pretty much use any/class (in circumstances when the argument relates to incoming damage/avoidance).
---
Whether you understand the math or not you just simply need to ask yourself a question: Is our raids main tank literally 2-shotable by the boss if we don't land any heals on them (e.g. because we got feared or something) within a 5.0 second window of time. The answer in the overwhelming number of circumstances is: of course we'd get some healing to the tank, or of course the tank isn't that fragile as to be 2-shotable (regardless of what is tanking).
---
Yes, I never said they didn't do it through that if you actually read what I wrote. I said it wasn't based on skill.
---
Seems perfect to me up in darkshore
---
ESO is really good though. Only thing holding it back is performance and optimization. The skill gap between bad players and tryhard players is insane.
---
This is true I know some irl friends that are willing to spend easily few hundred euro’s per year on this game. Their playtime is limited to half an hour per day.  I think a lot of people are in this position. If you don’t want to suck completely at level 60 and want to do a bit of pvp I’m not sucky ass hear you must buy gold to counter it a bit.
---
As of right now, I would just recommend any server with no queue... It's possible they'll do transfers once the game dies down, which would shake everything up again anyway. 
---
 Plus, you'll find rotten apples anywhere. I'm on Skullflame and have had a good time this far.
---
Still classic wf, get off methods dick
---
No. Unfortunately at this patch there's pretty much no chance of a druid becoming uncrittable by bosses. Even Prot pallies can't reliably do that.
---
Not to mention the general lack of gear and that encounters were designed with warriors in mind. So stance dancing for Ony and Magmadar, the fact that bear tanks don't have any decent defensive CDs... You can of course do that if your guild wants to, but it all will be much easier with a warrior tank.
---
Yes they just used magic.
---
Its not terrible, you can only translate like 10 letters max ingame
---
Blizzard caters to players like you. They made a perfect game for you. It's called Battle for Azeroth.
---
Classic players do not care that you do not like Classic. It wasn't made for you.
---
After our guild broke up close to the end of classic, about 10 of us took a group of 20 random people with us to BWL. We fully expected a wipefest, but somehow we cleared it without issue. They were all so happy.
---
That was the very last thing I ever did in WoW.  ^((until I came back for a few months in Pandaria))
---
Thanks for reminding me of that.
---
1.12 boys late patch &amp; nerfed beyond mad compared to the earlier ones. Nonetheless big well played! And a job well done to you.
---
Honestly I'd enjoy more clearing simpler unique raids than I would be playing the same raid over and over again through normal, heroic and mythic. With everyone else doing the same thing on LFR or above.
---
The raid boss mechanics is definitely better in the future but I enjoyed vanilla-Wrath raiding a lot more. Despite it's basicness. Exclusivity, immersion, requiring dedication is more rewarding than a difficult boss on mythic. Especially since the loot is a loot more exciting to get in vanilla, than just getting another higher ilvl item that you'll transmog away.
---
Looks like those people don't understand Sco's sarcasm.
---
So because their excitement isn't the same as your excitement it's invalid?
---
Imagine not realizing these people aren't you.
---
It's not everyone robbing themselves of the classic experience. I think it's just a select few, but I could be wrong. And yeah, I feel bad for them, but it's this competitive/contagious thing that starts from the top and trickles down. People do it without even realizing it's against their best interests.
---
God damn man that’s absolutely bullshit! I hope you never have that experience again ):
---
Classic was an MMO meant and aimed at more casual and clueless players. It's slower paced, simpler, easy to learn and medium to master.  Leveling is easier in Retail because it's just a bunch of tedious hoops to jump through, but dungeon and raids are way harder and more complicated. Trash mobs in bfa dungeons sometimes have more mechanics than classic bosses
---
They can play however they want, just dont claim something that has already been done, like reinventing the wheel and saying you were the first.

All swings and roundabouts, also meph just can't help him self
---
My theory is cosmetics will be cheaper in classic.
---
We just left a game that was overrun with pets and mounts, forced collectors to keep going or quit.  I quit in Cata with massive amount of achievement points and mounts/pets.  Felt like a gerbil in a wheel.
---
Classic was my opportunity to return to my favorite game without the need to grind meaningless shit on the side.
---
Just log of man let other people experience it. 
---
HAH fucking baited smart play
---
You can read guides on everything, but what you actually need to do is just *play*.
---
You are right, but I feel uneasy knowing that some of me friends are grinding it out and getting everything asap and I am there, at the end of the pack, slowly getting stuff done.
---
Continue up the path outside the tailor shop and enter the first store on the right after the corner, that's where the next trainer is.
---
I had a tank in RFC the other day who decided to do a huge pull (4-5 mobs) when the healer wasn't in the instance then promptly ragequit after he acted like we were in the wrong for not doing enough dps or something. Funny stuff. On the flipside though I've also run into people who are genuinely enjoying the experience here when they've only played retail before, which is something I'm happy about.
---
I'll try to believe that
---
not attack speed, DAMAGE normalization. a 1.0 attack speed cat does the same damage per second as a 2.0 speed cat.

I agree and you are right, but I’m personally not emotionally mature enough to handle a negative opinion about something I either really enjoy or am looking forward to.

These guys will dominate their server for years.

I tried that but for some reason the mobs attack range is far greater than mine for some reason so they start their attacks before I can anyway

I got to play for about 2 hours, now im in 3000 queue again..

3 months seems like a lot of time actually. I guess I'll get it before it begins, might even get something done before that, hopefully.
---
You play Vanilla because it’s fun, not hard. And because you make friends along the way because some content forces you to group.
---
But they couldnt stream private servers on twitch. They could on Youtube but didnt get any big viewer numbers.
---
no, you can clearly see him get ganked in the vods. if layering didn't exist it would be perma ganking
---
The general chat in the starting zones is just really garbage a lot of the time (I've started 3 characters, so I've been experiencing it even tonight). You can kind of tell who is the tourist and who isn't. Eventually they'll get bored and leave.
---
Its not a learning a curve, its a brainless grind. and even most streamers said that. There is no aspect in WoW that isn't already in most other MMOs that people shouldn't already know. everything just takes twice as long because people didn't optimize games that way back then.
---
Like Classic WoW, Literally takes 3x longer on everything than it needs to take. And thats literally the classic experience. Its essentially just Hardcore WoW.
---
The learning curve would be " wahhhh I can't beat this molten crater my gears bad wahhhh, wahhhh I get ganked in pvp contested zones wahhhhh i can't level wahhh" The learning curve is not having some idiot warlock spam hellfire 5x when your tank is building enmity. And that shit, I just get sick of after awhile. and trust me, i've seen enough of that type of attitude the last 4 days
---
This. You can grind as a group pretty easy. Where one can go to the toilet or make food while the other 4 keep farming. You switch out one or two at a time. Keep kiting and tagging mobs and just kill mobs for 10 hours straight. Probably faster than questing in vanilla.
---
Holy shit I knew deviate delight was rare as fuck.

Everyone in guild said they got one, maybe I just misremembered the drop.

First time a girl told me I was becoming bald was at 23. Took me 5 years to swallow it so yeah the struggle is real. I don't even watch Asmo but heh no hairs bro, go shave now.

I was a mage for Wrath and it made me super salty how awesome the warlock set was compared to my dopey mage set.
---
Yeah druids typically skip 40 mount due to travel form
---
Im playing on a Macbook Pro 2012 and it works just fine
---
I know the feeling, I'm at 23 with 2g
---
Yes Blizzard. Please restore the dark nights. They were awesome and added a lot to the immersion. Especially when you were someplace creepy like Duskwood and the ony real lightsource were the lamps in town and occasionally along the road. I may be thinking of a different game, but I could have sworn that back in vanilla I had a torch that I would equip when in Duskwood. Either way. Please restore the darkness.

Lol who has one gold
---
Told the same thing to a friend.. hes not even playing at the moment because of moving in s new home, and hes like ”whats in xy years, will they do this and that etc?” And im like “man.. the game is out since 5 days, i dont care whats after naxx etc at the moment, im just happy about the freaking game” i dont know why people stress them self with such useless things

&gt; meanwhile they do MC with level 50s and in greens and do Onyxia with less than 40 people.
---
Because they don't run meme specs. Kind of illustrates why the stigma is there. A handful of specs are *so much worse* than the rest of the "meta" that if you want to raid competitively, you cannot bring those specs. 
---
People aren't wrong about the viability of the meme specs, they're wrong about the reasons some players are against them. They see the big guilds reject balance druids and whatnot and decide they need to do the same themselves, without actually doing anything that warrants it. If you want to compete for world firsts and speedrun records, you have to reject meme specs. If you're just clearing the raids to gear up, you don't need a min-maxed setup.
---
But it remains true that the meme specs are insanely far behind the good specs in terms of sheer performance and value.
---
Yep have the Lesser right now and have a Greater in my bags ready to ding 13 😄
---
Cata was really cool when we got to see the progression of the zones, and even some of the updated race starts. Actually, pretty much the entire horde Eastern Kingdoms question experience was really good. It was making so much of it revolve around "OMG deathwing!" that was the issue, as it made jumping to BC then wrath make no sense, and didn't age well into future expansions.
---
Yeah, understanding 14's dungeon mechanics, youll find yourself AoEing very little by comparison - there is no run till the "wall" and aoe blast while the tank soaks damage stuff here in classic; that is somewhat of a thing in retail. 
---
There are some pulls that have normal mobs where its called upon, but usually youll want to follow the tanks first target on a pull - as that will usually be the mob that they have highest threat on. 
---
For me personally, on pulls that need it - I mark skull for 1st target then "X" for the second, so I can play my threat mini-game while you get to go ham. 
---
It will eventually become a point where your poly will become a necessity,  as previously stated - so get used to using it on mobs that arent the focus in lower level fights. It has diminishing returns, but keeping a mob out of the fight helps the tank and healer dramatically in larger pulls.
---
Same here, how do you/can you turn off elvui for this window?
---
  vanilla/bc era and  wotlk (up until lfr/lfg patch) looked like a  [continuing](https://tureng.com/tr/turkce-ingilizce/continuing)  series to me. What made you to divide them?
---
30 and impressed
---
That's s good thing.  Pugging is good for the community.
---
So I know a lot of these comments are super toxic but I don't actually have anything against ESO at all. I just saw the ad and thought it was hilariously bad.
---
Why because he doesn't look disgusting like you? Bet you felt ashamed when his profile got linked
---
I like it
---
TBC shitty expansion? Take a step back sir. And while I'm not 100% sure how difficult the TBC raids would be today, TBC has had the longest surviving bosses in wow history. Yeah, people are better today but people were good in TBC, TBC wasn't vanilla. They weren't lost sheep flocking to raids. Hardcore guilds from vanilla were formed and organized and took months to kill Kael'thas.
---
Ya thats my pov right now too. Its making everything a bit more trivial just now
---
A miserable pile of secrets
---
Did you actually believe Method, people who are constantly going hard on retail, who likely have little to no private server experience, were legitimately thinking they would get the first kill over people like these guys?
---
They have literally been saying that from the start but okay guess everyone loves to hate method right now.
---
I don't rly care about them, but I rly dislike people taking shit out of context and using it to shittalk.
---
Keep a rabbits foot in your inventory, horde players know this secret well!
---
In the usual screenshot folder. Make sure you remove '-master" from the folder name.
---
I'd rather have separate TBC/Wrath servers with their own dropdown selection than do Vanilla+ or whatever, tbh.
---
Me too!!! I was like.... umm is it bugged? Buddy proved me wrong lol
---
;)
---
It would be nice to have raids in game that don't get cleared for 30+ days, but I'd rather Blizz leave the classic raids as they are. 
---
When it comes to discussions about post Naxx-Content maybe Blizz should add a raid that's nearly impossible, then after 4 weeks add world bosses with drops that make it more manageable to incentivise large-scale WPvP.
---
Barrens is the best leveling region. All the quests, concentrated on certain areas, great quest design, good mixture of feeling of rewardment and grinding, nice atmosphere, chat, music, everything
---
I call him raggy :)
---
That they've had 15 years to prepare for...  This is what these guys live for.  It's impressive considering their gear is trash, but it's not the same as going into the fight and learning the mechanics.  The fight has been scripted for 15 years.
---
How did they grind Hydraxian Waterlords to exalted already? Or did Blizz just remove the runes that were required?
---
&gt;I am also sure people underestimate how gear depended Ragnaros was.
---
Are you aware why im quoting this?
---
Jubei wasn't really vanilla realm though, was deployed shortly before (or possibly even for) BC, it was most commonly called dm on khaz'gororh (although occasionally VC but most people had no idea what was meant by VC half the time)
---
WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL MOONWELLS.
---
I signed up yesterday with the intention of playing for an hour or so when I had time during the week.
---
That was nine hours ago.
---
I started during MoP, and I'm loving my time in Classic. Feels like an entirely different game is all, but I went in expecting it to be like that.
---
Did 7 to 10. Was feeling wrong (no issues though). Got back to 7 instantly.
---
Is WoW still like this..? I havent played in a very long time, my computer was smashed by my dad and I havent been able to afford a computer in my adult years...what's the level cap now? It was 70 when I played last...I miss those days
---
Starwars is far bigger than wow. Expand your social circle.
---
They are harder to farm gold through mob grinding than other classes but that doesn’t stop them from seeking out other forms of gold like taking advantage of professions. Running around picking herbs or mining to sell the mats, making high level Alchemy pots for raiders, cooking and fishing for high level food that boosts stats, etc.
---
Ahahaahahahaha, I got so much shit on this sub for saying that MC and Ony would be killed within a week of launch. 
---
Any brave people gonna crawl out the wood work and double down on their stance that "WoW Classic end-game is hard"? 
---
With all the resources out there and ease of comms, 15 years worth of specs and gearing optimisation. Peiple seriously thought that MC and Ony were going to be hard?
---
Something seems up with the wands. I'm.sute it's legit to vanilla, but I can't get it to stop casting quick enough sometimes. I try to use another spell, and the wand fires off again. I don't know how many soul shards I've missed because instead of draining at the last second, my damn wand won't stop firing.
---
Ha ha ha ha ha
---
I was also thinking southpark "would you like a photo of yourself on the line ride"
---
Yea agreed. Many things are wrong with retail but I think transmog is awesome. If nothing else, it keeps old content relevant.
---
Adults with jobs? The game hasn't been out a week and these people have like 4 days /played or higher.
---
i basicly dont wanna start playing if it will move to burning legion
---
Lol guy is saying nobody said it, then demands proof, then another one and still doesnt admit he was wrong 😂 tired of those stupid kiddos
---
1.12
---
It'll still count you as afk after a bit and log you.
---
How are they destroying the vanilla experience? Has your experience been affected? I doubt it. 
---
These guys have undoubtedly had their vanilla experience on multiple private servers.
---
&gt;people wanted WoW Classic right?
---
&gt;But then everybody goes into this mad frenzy to level up to 60 as fast as possible
---
You are well aware that this is downright a lie, right? Not everybody is in such a frenzy and you just don't know what people asked for what and how.
---
&gt;Idk man, people are robbing themselves of the experience they wanted all along
---
Because maybe they are not the same people? It feels you just built a strawman argument so you can feel better about yourself for...I don't know, leveling slower or something?
---
Hey cool, did those high end mythic guilds even hit 60 yet?
---
Ha! Same!
---
My server is just people saying that only noobs and zoomers call it dm instead of vc. I'm on sulfuras.
---
High pop isnt the problem. its a language wall that separates my server. i wanted a high pop server . . .  anyways got my refund wasnt doing the first 25 lvls over again.
---
I forget what I paid for it, but I’m glad I did!!
---
WoW was never hard by any measure which is why every person who played MMO's before WoW hates/hated it. 
---
The re-release was interesting and a brilliant businesses development strategy, and I guess, more difficult than retail? Pac-man is more difficult than both. Retail doesn't even require you to move to get to 120. I do think it was entertaining to watch for a few minutes though.
---
and?  what does that have to do with a queue?
---
BuT cLlAsSiC iS sO hArD yOu gUiSsS
---
That's orc. Wisp is more like "srrvshsrrrsh"
---
Are you trolling me? Did you have a look at their stream title since classic launch?
---
Happened to me also. Lvl 12 shaman. I saw a lvl 8 shaman with Lightning Shield, and I didn't. Ran to the trainer to realise I was only looking at Elemental Skills and not scrolling down for the other two trees.
---
Hi, /u/jerbookins

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cy7mtz/addon_request_ackis_recipe_list/).

I give out potions whenever I visit a starting zone, folk are always happy to get +armour or a bunch of emergency heals to use whenever they want.
---
I only got the idea because someone gave me potions when I first got to Brill.
---
"no one said that" is how you started it little liar :)
---
Would like to know as well lol, I never know what mobs to grind for what I need/want. Any guides out there that anyone know?
---
That may show that classic wow isn't meant to be for 'pro' guilds which is actually a good thing. They will become bored soon enough (not that I'm playing it just following some news)
---
Ok
---
Rent free. 24/7.
---
Method is only the best guild in the wow history. Again, hard to to be an achievement to kill a boss 10 after 1st release with 1 mechanic.
---
Even worse.
---
So if you play 66 hours you will be lvl 15?
---
Unless you use the game as a chat no.
---
Funny thing, this is exactly how all of them look.
---
Good luck bro.   
---
I tried everything to fix that, in the end I had to make a ticket. Was shut out for around 3 hours.  
---
It seems to happen if the server goes down while you are dead in an instance.
---
Some people report having there character become available after a few minutes, but like I said it took hours for me.
---
I highly suggest creating a ticket.
---
If the people playing have raided at least normal raids in retail, they will find Vanilla raids incredibly easy. You shouldn't expect a challenge.
---
These people are free to leave back to retail for their weekly LFR runs and talking about how Classic is easy.
---
Ok thank you!
---
I've encountered a few of those types and I really don't understand why they exist. What do they lose out on by retail existing? Why are they experts in how other people have fun?
---
Its not that retail players are more skilled than clasdic players. Its about players now being better than they were back then. Of course private server players beat method
---
And notoriety,Jokerd had like 350k viewers, they have the opportunity to gain fans verry fast.
---
No it released with 3 PVP servers, sorry you joined the rush and crowded onto the server that was FULL before release, perhaps you could choose one of the other 3 servers that exist?
---
I think blizzard will eventually have to move on from vanilla to BC and WoTLK but not anymore further. 60 lvl cap and classic raids will just mean that eventually it will become a ghosttown. 
---
Maybe it would not be a bad idea to think about #somechanges, to make end game more difficult but keep most of the game design (although I think dungeon XP needs to be nerfed - atm everybody is just farming instances, nothing happens in open world).
---
If I had option to play classic/tbc/wotlk and switch somehow (by talkin to Chromie maybe?) I would play this game for long years. If it stays just classic I will eventually quit.
---
This game is only for a week so far, each phase should last for few months at least.
---
Kungen said it before, raiding killed the game, maybe he is right after all.
---
Wouldnt have made a difference.
---
If they tuned it more difficult then these no-lifers would have spent 3 more days getting their pre-mc bis before killing Rag.
---
I did it today, and man is it a clusterfuck in that cave. Quick respawns. The healing trolls and the trolls that disorient you drive you nuts. Mobs are tightly packed so it’s inevitable that you pull more than 1 every time without fail.
---
&gt;This would be the equivalent of launching Classic TBC with the end-of-expansion patch where the "highlight boss" Illidan was PUGable in leveling blues. 
---
No that would be the equivalent of launching classic with the end-of-expansion patch where C'Thun is PUGable in leveling blues.
---
1.7 is a higher number than 1.12, so your comment doesn't make sense?
---
Naxx was the hardest vanilla raid. So few people even got in there
---
MC easier than ps
---
Ony slightly harder than ps
---
Druid can tank heal melee and spell cast. Not the best at any of them but will give you a taste of how each aspect plays
---
How do people layer hop? Log in and log out?
---
well, he right, a sad fact
---
They aren't though,. how many really good players do you think have stayed playing WOW all this time? The majority of competetive wow players in terms of PVE more than likely moved on to other games by now. League of Legends has a huge ex wow playerbase, the good players left a long time ago. What's left is many people who like the rpg element over the dps freaks who used to be around, you can only do the same thing so many times before you get bored. 
---
WoW is not a mechanically intensive game, you are going to be good from 2000 hours of raid practice as you are from 10000, if that isn't the case why is the best retail guild in the world being left in the dust?
---
malderon made a vid today about exactly this lol
---
ERRRMAHGERD CLASSIC IS THE BEST LEVELING EXPERIENCE, THE BEST LORE/IMMERSION!!!1  /proceeds to torture themselves via chain dungeoning with no sleep to get to 60 in a few days
---
Alright.
---
By the way, tried the command. Doesn't work :(.
---
Well, no, he is very entertaining...
---
Just because you don’t like someone’s content doesn’t mean it isn’t entertaining.
---
Took 2 days off school and I’m still only lvl 26 :(
---
A 14 1/2 to 13 year old memory can be very deceiving.
---
Also, people are mainly talking about the leveling being hard. The hardest boss in raids has always been the logistics boss of getting 40 people into the raid at the same time and having them behave like properly thinking human beings for 3 hours.
---
You think you’re quitting but you’ll be back. Oh, yes. You’ll be back. 
---
*evil cackle*
---
Vvailing Caverns.
---
That literally happened though, you know that, right?
---
It would have been better if you just clipped the end
---
Well it *was* hard when nobody had 15 years of experience, but by today's standards,  no.
---
Progress is on Firemaw
---
Definitely keeping Grobbulus as a potential for my server. I played on argent dawn in Vanilla. High school me loved the opportunity to make an ass of myself while RP guilds would be having ceremonies. 31 year old me relishes the opportunity to develop my characters back story. Honestly, role-playing just adds another layer to an already rich classic experience. Now to get my rig built so I can join my brothers on the Horde in Kalimdor!
---
I laughed so hard and there’s no way to explain to my gf
---
Its neutral or friendly.
---
Most people want Classic so retail takes notes from the positives. We need retail to take the good parts about vanilla and replace the antisocial part from retail, while also maintaining difficulty in raids, but also making leveling fun again, more content during an expansion relevant again and not deleting progress every patch.
---
i want that post to become a copy pasta meme
---
yep. so many dumb uses. Oh, quest mob you need was recently killed? layer hop. Just got ganked? hop in order to avoid wpvp. etc. etc.
---
It is modern retail wow engine. With world, environment, database imported from vanilla. Needed few changes and tweaks as todays retail won't support vanilla on its own.
---
17 here!
---
Yeah - I hated WoW back when it originally launched, coming from MUDs and pre-t2a UO the game was always a joke difficulty wise. I did still beta and play on launch just like every other mmo player back then and it was just as busy.
---
Meta Will always be meta. The less time u spend in a raid clearing tho more time u can spend in the next/farm raid consumable or stuff like that. So talking a feral instead of a fury warr with 3x dps Will always be a loss nomatter if u clear or not and ppl Will always try to be elitist. Atleast most of us :)
---
&gt; After reading a lot i ´ve seen ppl saying that Warrior is the only tank that can tank the raids and it happens becuz pallys doesnt have the taunt skill. After checking i have seen that pallys doesnt have it but druids do! So, why cant druids be a viable tank in raids?
---
Druids are viable raid tanks, anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Druid tank will however require more research and planning than warrior to keep up with them.
---
Sincerely,
---
a Shaman Raid Tank.
---
In a few weeks we wont have 12 000 tourists farming the server starting zones and I can finally quest my characters
---
You say you love it as it is but use an addon that fixes it because, well, you don't love it as it is.
---
You need to go outside more if you are that affected by someone who doesn’t even know you exist...
---
Found the next shooter lads.
---
"you thought you do, but you dont" guy was right.
---
you thought you wanted the nostalgia of your childhood experience in WoW back 
---
you got a 2019 dungeon simulator whose only goal is to be streamed for views and donations $$$
---
Yeah, I think it's pretty crazy. I didn't expect it to happen, mostly because I didn't think so many people could reach 60 that fast, but of course not all of them did, haha.
---
Because you commented that under the old ToS it would be bannable
---
I disagree. They were cool and I'd love them if I was just another grunt in my class that finally was allowed to sit with the big boys. Instead I am the god warrior king chosen one. Nothing more stupid that me finally leveling my shitty paladin to 110 after years of neglect, get the quest hall thing and be named Highlord and I'm like? I know nothing about paladin, this paladin is a shitty character, shitty geared, cleared 0 bosses. And I'm named Highlord. The moment I phase 10 highlords run past me as well.
---
We as characters in a MMO should NEVER be the focal point of any story. LFR shouldn't be treated as some cannon lore that every knucklehead kills the big bad. The guys that actually clear mythics and world firsts should get a title that is instantly removed once the next patch comes.
---
Including 16 rather than 8 debuff slots, huge difference
---
The fact that it's old
---
Okay, but what about Bowser's big bean burrito?
---
It'll be getting cleared by pugs in a month.
---
imo Sylvanas' motives just make no sense, she sorta just does things  that don't benefit her just so she can look like the bad guy? It reminds me of 'Suicide Squad' villains.
---
Even if it were written that she was crazy from Old God influence/Azerite, the journey was poor to watch unfold and it would have been better if they told us this from the beginning so we knew and could speculate at the Old God's plans and realize that Sylvanas is a lost cause. Instead I have been forced to try and take Sylvanas and Nathanos seriously and I just can't because their actions are just too stupid.
---
My wife is playing on my old labtop from 2011. Works Wonders :D
---
Had a mage in an SFK run. 4 guildies and him as a pug. We all saw the warning signs right away lol, definite retail player. Would run ahead of tank and pull entire rooms, and we were slightly low on lvls, so it was tough. Gosh was it still fun though. Managed to do 7 mobs + a mini boss, one guy left alive. Mage would always die on every boss because they’d over aggro within 5 seconds. Tried telling him but he was of the opinion he could “solo the entire thing”, I guess by blinking around.
---
Find the clip of him reporting the Horde guy. 
---
Bet you a Reddit Gold (or Silver if you’re poor) that he never actually submitted it.
---
Lemme know when you’ve cleared it.
---
Forsakens are evil in vanilla. The starting cinematic makes it clear.
---
Spongy and bruised, you mean.
---
Oh, are we gonna make changes now?
---
ok.....
---
now can we try something something that's actually challenging, like tanking it with a shaman?
---
Stick with hunter, it's the easiest to level BY FAR
---
all the ppl that trashed on and down valued private servers achievements because they thought they were undertuned must feel pretty dumb now lol
---
Retail is an amusement park. Go on ride x, go to experience y, participate in event z.
---
Classic wow is a grindy sandbox. You can pretty much do whatever however anything that you want to acquire will require farming and time to get.
---
Classic WoW, when compared to mmo's of it's time (everquest, lineage 1 &amp; 2, ascherons call, ultima online, starwars galaxies precu, dark age of camelot), was a more casual mmo, with maybe guild wars 1 being similar but different.
---
Classic WoW compared to todays mmo's is precieved as harder, as it is more grind intensive then some current mmo's, being eso and ff14.
---
Ff14 and eso can still be grindy but they don't usually make you farm for green items or bags, which are more of a big deal in WoW Classic, even at later levels where bags can hold more and older greens can help level professions.
---
-cheers
---
Correct again. The person replying to your post either didn't play the original launch or has an extremely selective memory of what it was actually like.
---
Banned lmao
---
Big differences to play style and a far longer grind. There is mob tagging so once you hit a mob only you and people in your party can get xp and loot from killing it. The game doesn’t just point you to where everything is, there are no quest markers so you must hunt things down yourself. General chat will tend to be alive with people helping each other. The game lends itself to naturally creating teamwork and community. If you want you can get addons that add the retail features. Some areas will be different as Azeroth was changed during the sundering when the  4th xpac Cataclysm happened. Raids go up to 40 players so they can be pretty mental.
---
If you call it VC I'm kicking you from the group
---
Ok level is one thing, but how tury received ale the fireress, flasks etc? Imo - this is not the same classic or they have blizz support.
---
Calling WoW classic a bad game is your opinion. I totally disagree tho. I've been playing since pre TBC.
---
Classic felt more rewarding than current WoW and feels more like a community. I signed someone's guild chart yesterday and he gave me some linen as a thank you. Small things like that puts a smile on my face which I don't get often anymore in retail WoW.
---
Doing quests that are actually a bit difficult in accomplishing feels way more rewarding than current WoW in which you can blaze through quests pretty easily. My group died a few time, so it made us pull more careful and really watch out for other mobs.
---
Classic WoW is definitely a game for casuals as well, if you like to explore and actually put in some time to do a quest then yes. At this point I'm currently level 17 and I take my time.
---
However it's not a game for those that have like two hours of gametime available or those that want their hand held with every quest. For the latter we have retail WoW.
---
It’s so that another “Asmongold reacts” video shows up in my YouTube promoted feed despite me never having watched an Asmongold highlight video.
---
Oh I didn't knew ! Nice. That the kind of stuff I always found cool
---
Wouldn’t that make them more expensive as they are less around
---
my guild, that was one of best, stuck at the boss before neferian for months. this was may, more then 1,5 years after launch. but LH might have buffed the bosses, with their armor ratings and whatnot, so we will see.
---
i am playing guitar for 15 years, it is very easy to me. come play some.
---
Reasonable
---
Whats funny about "go back to retail"?

The no hair shit is better and even thats unoriginal. I dont like asmon btw, inb4 the fanboy comments come...

But atleast be original while trolling him.

Level how you want to level.
---
Get people from a different layer to invite you to their party.
---
I’m still in the queue.
---
Right. This man is Ion Hazzikostas. Current director of World of Warcraft.
---
you got your answer I guess lul
---
Do you realize that their entire roster might not be streaming and just playing the game while an army of other people are farming stuff for them to help. Just because 7 people are streaming doesn't mean they don't have players also competing without streaming.
---
👿👿👿
---
I've got bad news for your upcoming levels. It's like the gold just disappears into thin air and I'm not even buying every skill
---
They are afraid new players might have a single bad moment, so they make it where classes can do everything themselves. I understand from a business perspective, appealing to the biggest masses makes money. But it has its drawbacks to game quality and community, and there's examples out there.
---
Mic drop
---
HAHA i was in a party doing this exact quest when the servers disconnected. i just wanted to hand my quest in too. :,(

His stream character voted for Trump but as far as Zack, I don’t think he actually voted due to not wanting to leave the house.

It's actually really easy to wipe in MC for even an average semi-hardcore guild, but only really on trash. It just requires one hunter fucking up a pull of the surger next to fire imps, or not pulling the lava pack in baron geddon's room back far enough and geddon aggroes from proximity to the hunter's pet...
---
Things like this will happen quite a few times over the first few months of raiding MC for most guilds.
---
Dang, I remember reading the original wow one way back when in the Sunday newspaper...
---
Mainly because of the some of small but not difficult things to do to clear Mc. 
---
The rep that took a few hours, the access that takes one brd run, the farm of rf stuff at least for the tank, the minimum dps to have for golemag.
---
But I’m glad they did it!
---
Happened to us, we 3 manned first mobs and crocs and kept reseting dungeon to get hides
---
Legion legendaries? Fuck 'em! Layer upon layer of RNG loot? It stays!
---
Alternate progression system based on the talent system of old? Nope, none of that in my seasonal WoW! Continuous grind for a much less interesting artifact? Oh we're keeping that one!
---
not nerfed but the power creep in talents and just working properly was real
---
Smart people.
---
I've done this for years, surprised I don't see it mentioned more often. Mouse wheel up to attack, down to follow. Feels really intuitive and grants you so much more control over your pet.
---
Kara110 is one of my favorite dungeons in the game, so you might be on to something.
---
Grinding solo or in duo better ?
---
Easiest path for a warrior is to find a preist friend.
---
The power of friendship solves both issues the classes have.
---
Were you actually? haha.  Every time hunter came by I as equally terrified and sad on their behalf. I also didn't realize she has 3 spawn points? You live and you learn I guess
---
Happy taming ;)
---
Trade chat is 75% spanish portuguese or portuguese spanish. even when they link items and the game translates it for you i still cant buy from them because they only want to speak to players thier own language. like i said got my refund tho.
---
Awesome! Couldn't have done it better myself! .....wait.
---
Idk about evil. The scourge is evil - the forsaken are just trying to survive - the cinematic makes this clear. Definitely self-serving though.
---
layering has nothing to do with dungeon grinding
---
Lol this game is hear to stay for at least two more years.  You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Thats Louis CK!
---
lol why are you raging? just a difference of opinion. Chill out and enjoy life.
---
I'd assume that's because most people on Reddit think WoW was the first MMO and lack any context of what difficult in an MMO actually means.
---
I played deadmines tonight with a tank that couldn't hold aggro on the boss, forget the adds, and a priest whose first instinct when getting focused was to jump off the boat.
---
I leveled my first preist in TBC and there was an awesome talent in holy or discipline that made your next smite free and instant on crit with smite. Was so nice to level as holy/disc with that and inner focus and some other useful disc talents
---
Ah right.
---
In normal decimal notation, yes. But this is version numbering where aa.bb.cc corresponds to:  
---
aa = Major release. Like vanilla, bc, wotlk, etc.  
---
bb = Minor release. Like content patches in expansions.  
---
cc = Bugfixes. Normally no new content, just fixes/patches/balancing.
---
This is pretty much consistent all over software development and the individual parts just count up without "spilling" over. Just resetting when the higher one increases.
---
&gt; It's a real smell-the-roses kind of game for me
---
I completely agree, yesterday I went to Stormwind with my night elf but instead or running through the Wetlands I swam around Dun Morogh, I stopped several times because the view was stunning and I couldn't help just looking at it.
---
I’m so happy I got the rod in 15 mins of grinding, I was preparing for the worst
---
&gt;Apes etc are good at what they've spent thousands of hours on, and done countless times. That shouldn't surprise anyone.
---
Tbf that goes for every MOBA and FPS as well but you still see your friends queue with silver players with 5k hours on account :P
---
In work, yeah.
---
Feels good to me
---
Nah, TBC is shit. People severly underestimte how much that expansion changes the game. Even basic things such as creating extreme faction imbalance (alliance is not even a faction in TBC) resulting in faction based servers, death of world pvp. Flying and being summoned everywhere, wellfare epics, shitty 5mans designed for speed running (very similar design to those on retail), 1-60 reworked to suit solo-players. Streamlining the classes, Outland being a tiny shitty continent (instead of everyone being spread out on huge Azeroth) etc.
---
TBC might not be the worst expansion, but its a shit expansion that causes a lot of damage to the game.
---
Thats funny.  Basing the life and popularity of a game on the number of twitch viewers there are.
---
FFXIV passed WoW on subscribers a couple months ago but its still viewed way less than retail classic streams.
---
So yeah, no.
---
I'd check out Questie is on the twitch app, real lifesaver
---
I assume they do not want the bug hotfixed, maybe they're exploiting it as well or something.
---
Is there any way to make an auto attack macro then?
---
The speed makes up for it for sure. they can pull like 20 things at a time and have 4-5 mages just blizzard it down in no time.
---
I feel like that would be good to change, since its actually just showing misleading information.
---
Comments like this make wanna download and play the game NOW before I fall behind
---
Perfect!
---
&gt; going down to a raid wearing almost entirely T3 shit.
---
Shows how much you know.
---
Mald boomers pepeLaugh
---
I really hate when people say pserver experience means nothing is classic. Sure there are differences, but pservers got REEEEALLY close to vanilla in terms of values, db, even spawn points.
---
I get it that its cool to say like that but it really isnt true
---
I'm playing classic wow right and discord says i'm playing world of warcraft but my friends have world of warcraft classic being displayed?
---
Most people in chat said they had good groups and 35k/hr exp. I mean, running SM Gy from 30 is probably good, but I enjoy questing so I won't do it as much.
---
All two words
---
the trick was, only the warrior drop em
---
And? People that will stick around to raid at max lvl will know how to deal with everything. The mechanics aren't hard, neither are the requirements once you know them. 
---
You got bad players, maybe new players with you in deadmines, the more high lvl you go the better players you will encounter.
---
I love Anus Tart
---
It's not hard but it's hard?
---
He's saying the retail guild itself is not participating, which is what you said.
---
6-8 prot tanks? what? Why would you ever have more than 3?
---
I didn't say it wasn't at the time, but we are talking about classic wow and this is the classic wow subreddit.
---
They did, but it wasn't onyxia and rag that they talked about
---
They usually say Naxx or c'thun
---
i'm lvl 25 got a refund because they don't even offer paid transfers on classic wow. Was willing to pay the $25.
---
Yeah say that to all the people attack method on their stream for no reason :)
---
Whats the point of their world first what ever event then? :D
---
Ohhhh I’ll get that, thanks a bunch!
---
This has reinforced a few ideas I’ve had growing in my head for a while now:
---
- Most people are full of crap in regards to their information and skill in this game. These people just took every “expert” opinion on how things ought to be done, and flushed all that down the toilet.
---
- Most people have severely underestimated the utility of Private Servers, and have scoffed at the mere mention of them in comparisons to classic. In the private servers I played on, everything felt more difficult, especially dungeons.
---
- Most people are still extremely bad at this game.
---
Congrats to these guys, well done!
---
They're in EU. I'm originally from EU. We can take off weeks without an issue. We are not poverty like US.
---
Yep. I have 5 in Wand Spec with 5 in Spirit Tap. Now I gotta decide where to go from here
---
You guys are the real champions of the day! This is what WoW is about for me. I love that you get a chance to journey with people you've never met and they become a very real part of your life. There's something to be said about a good old fashioned LAN party with the crew though. I envy you all!

---
Leveling shouldn't be changed.. but you're saying we need to change leveling? I don't get it.
---
They probably have some good rares från BRD and UBRS  as well
---
Maybe if the Alliance wasn't financing The Scarlet Crusade to retake Lordaeron they'd have room to talk
---
There's some items crafted by alchemists that are needed for quests, e. g. frost oil or troll blood elixir. Those can be sold at a profit.
---
Yeah that min maxing seems maybe a bit more necessary for casuals doing the harder p-server raids, but not the easy version in classic.
---
Oh well, that just means I can keep taking my
---
Time to 60. 1-2 months. Then get some gear and still find an MC raid slot.
---
The initial leveling process was slower then. People didn't have farming techniques worked out, online guides to read, knowledge of how to optimize talents. 
---
It took time for everyone to hit max level, people were running weird builds that players today would scratch their heads at.
---
They had sorry DPS, sorry healers, sorry tanks and little in the way of addon assistance. Not because they were bad players, but because they didn't have over a decade of experience, research and expirementation to go off of.
---
The guys who did this came in knowing the exact path they would take, save for a few discoveries unique to retail. They got the best gear they could as quickly as they could and got enough warm bodies into the raid to do the job. They knew the exact talents to take, the exact strats to use, and played their classes optimally in a way the people at vanilla launch couldn't have known how to do.
---
Also mage with blink and ice block is good to group it all together.
---
I fucking lost it on Shaman. Absolutely perfect.
---
Can tell hes no classic player. I jumped for joy the other day when I started cos I got a red bag in the starter zone on my tauren  shaman haha
---
Yes! You can use a macro like this to turn on auto attack whenever you Sinister Strike for example:
---
    /cast Sinister Strike
---
The `/startattack` command turns on auto attack and won't turn it back off like the normal Attack button would do. I typically wire up all my opening skills with `/startattack`.
---
Ragnaros &amp; Onyxia have never been killed within the first week of release, they are the first.
---
RIP LOL
---
dude, I broke 2 gold today! I was all the way up to 2g 28s. Of course it'll all be gone once I ding 24 and have to train my skills
---
lvl 25 stop being a dbag and realize that this is a porblem on my server.
---
They're elitists in what is essentially a completely different game? What's that have to do with this? Monkeynews scoffed at people memeing Method and other streamers who actually know things know Method wasn't actually going for WF.
---
I'm only stating what everyone else who isn't just jumping on the twitch chat aids train knows. I'm no fan of Method. I haven't played retail much in years.
---
Gankfest, dead mobs, crowded areas. It's fun though, I wouldn't just sit in a dungeon all day, quite boring.
---
No rush to 60 really.
---
And it's been less than a week.
---
I guess Blizzard was right after all in expecting people to quit soon.
---
Using twitch emotes outside of twitch.  My point on social skills proven.
---
If you're warlock didn't soul stone your healer that's the players fault not the games. Sounds like you're not the type of person is for and that's fine, go play something mindless.
---
Sooooo, is wow classic too easy?
---
&gt;TBC shitty expansion? Take a step back sir. TBC was great and why do clearing times matter in terms of releasing the expansion?
---
Because besides raids, TBC is just a much shittier version of WOW than vanilla. Lets say you roflstomp all the raids, and with the much faster progression in TBC you are stuck once again doing dailies, afking on your flying mount in Shattrath and being summoned everywhere.
---
&gt;TBC has had the longest surviving bosses in wow history.
---
Modern mythic raids are much more difficult than anything in tbc or vanilla
---
Are you using that argument to defend the use of VC?
---
Yes it is. To steal the answer above from u/lewdusername 
---
&gt; The actual answer is because the last defias brotherhood quest only tells you to kill VanCleef. None of the quests in the chain make any mention of The Deadmines so people would look for a group to kill VanCleef and type LFG VC. Anyone who says otherwise, like that people only used VC because of Dire Maul, is a DM-baby trying to revise history to make it look like their acronym was the original. It's also important to note that it's only really NA alliance that used VC. Horde never had to search for VC because they'd never get the quest. Other regions likely just knew killing VanCleef involved going to the Deadmines because the game had been out for a while.
---
It’s a troll parodying Bella Delphine just laugh and move on
---
I don’t know why people are surprised. APES has been planning for exactly this for the past year.
---
Yeah, WoW has never been and still isn't a difficult game. It's a time sink.
---
Ragnoros and onyxia were the only 2 raid bosses in classic ?
---
you will still need them
---
PvP racials are more impactful than Pve racials. Escape Artist is really great for every class that can be a gnome.
---
Do the chinese servers still give you a debuff when you've been online for a long time, or is that some propoganda I've just read in western newspapers years ago?

---
&lt;NOPE&gt;...&lt;APES&gt;.....Monkeynews and Maitoz are absolute legends of the private server community. Seeing that guild name under a player meant serious business
---
Private servers had a more accurate emulation. Before Blizzard shut the best one down and the rest went to shit as well. If you wanted to enjoy true vanilla, you had your chance in 2014-17.
---
It was more of an alliance US thing.
---
Deep?
---
Give it a few weeks and they will be gone. I warrior tanked all through vanilla and the idiot images or hunters that feel the need to "pull for you" is fucking mental
---
The talents and balance were not 1.12 version. 1.12 version is significantly easier because players are a lot stronger
---
Progress is aiming for MC today or tomorrow. The "next group" of guilds (like the streamer ones) are planning MC for this Monday, not in 3-4 weeks.
---
The German PvP server Lucifron had 15k queues (6h waiting) at prime time on Tuesday/Wednesday.
---
Was always sarth on my server.
---
Wish i would have seen this earlier. i made it to lvl and have almost noone to trade with or get into dungeons with.
---
Hillsbrad fields. The humans.
---
i think they should just remove that u can 10 man normal dungeons. i have bin in SM the last 2 days and its not only boring but also by far the fastest way to lvl. it also carries another problem that they only want locks mages and priest from what i have seen (might be worng)
---
One of my friends was talking about some shit like that happened to them today.
---
I know that feel. I get home from work at 10 or so and go to bed at 4. No sun for me :(
---
SW park has many
---
I gained over half a level farming those before completing the quest
---
That makes sense if you're on one of the original servers, but I started on Shazzrah, changed to Gehennas when Blizzard warned about Shaz, then again switched to Firemaw and then ended up settling on Mograine which came out a few hours before release. It now has 9 hour queues at prime time. 
---
Feels shitty to keep blaming the players for not jumping through hoops when we just want to stop moving our friends around and play the damn game. All this because blizzard intentionally put us in this situation with TWO PvP servers.
---
I didnt want a FREE transfer was willing to pay the $25
---
Nice names
---
When classic released there was only 1 PvP server. By the end of release day they had 3 PvP servers. But that doesn't help when beforehand everyone and their friends had decided to play on the only PvP server available to them. Not easy to get in contact and convince all of your friends to abandon the server that they might already be playing
---
It was mostly a joke response to your 'players are better now'
---
I thought so!  Cheers
---
This is the most adult post i've read on this subreddit. Makes me thonk.
---
Noone from the Nost team ever got hired, what are you smoking? They just flew a few of them to their HQ to gather info on the Classic demand.
---
it's kind of a toxic meta, but it allowed me to complete stv without having to fight for a single mob, so it's a small victory.  30k+ questing xp isnt anything to sneeze at, and on the plus side i dont have to start at the same dungeon for 20 hours
---
Well they are though. I remember in vanilla people didn't even know what aggro was, let alone try to hold it.
---
I called this since lightbringer... private server guilds like progress, APES, Salad Bakers, Grizzly, etc. will put Method out of business. Even my pserver guild is going to beat Method to a rag kill (were on track for Monday night). Any decent guild can kill rag with a raid full of 55s in greens (except main tank).
---
You sound like manager.
---
Well you seemed surprised, so you're welcome.
---
I ran into and befriended a chinese gold farmer. A hunter soloing/abusing bosses in Maraudon...
---
Max level you can just rush through old raids to get cool shit. It's pointless and there is no sense of status when everyone wears badass looking mog raid sets from previous xpacs.
---
monkey news is a known racist along with his guild apes

I mean, sure that could be one way. But I won't take some random person by their word, just because he's using a Channel that is hosted by a random person.

What is useful though is me making sure I'll never be griefed again, with an Addon that reminds me who griefed me and how.
---
Man the warrior thing is so true, i always pull like everything around me for some reason. Aggrorange is an alien concept ^^
---
Time investment != skill. As far as I'm aware not a single high end mythic guild gives a shit about classic. There's what, like 5-7 guys from method? Haven't heard of a single top 50-100 world guild switching from retail to classic.
---
Yeah it's hilarious. 
---
I can't wait till they weren't actually playing WoW.
---
Except there's a huge boon to these speed run events : fundraising.
---
Oh and hosts to entertain people and explain what's going on (=
---
Please explain how the math is wrong. This should be good.
---
Remember to read slowly, because I have a feeling your math is only wrong because your comprehension is.
---
Everyone i ever spoke to called them both DM and expected people to be able to work out for themselves that a lvl 20 wasnt off to ferelas...
---
And to think that all of northern EK used to be full of living human towns as well. It's pretty fucked up.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sXFe951xcI

in the first 2 minutes he sais that its more about celebrating launch than a real race
---
I just realized that with retail draining away that type of players, Classic may actually be *better* because retail exists and our realms as a whole might actually be slightly *more* social than back in the day.
---
I think it's challenging enough to waste your life to get week 1 onyxia and rag kill.

Some flights might have plug ins however depending on the type of laptop and energy requirement it might not work. I remember plugging in a laptop on a flight and it started charging just fine. However, when I wanted to try that with my MSI gaming laptop, it would not charge. I did truly several other plug ins and it still did not work and then I was told of how every plug in cans only feed a certain amount of energy.

Im sleepy as hell and I suck at charging terminology.

The real challenge in Vanilla have always been naxx. I mean there is Some pretty nasty trash mobs in AQ40 (They are acctually harder than the bosses) but most people are gonna be shocked when they breeze through every raid and then try naxx the first time. MC usually takes around 30 min and we used to do mc, bwl and aq on one raid day. Ony is often splitfarmed (20 man) so you get more loot. However Naxx had its own dedicated raid day. You cannot win the four horsemen fight without totally on point, and clear coordination. Source: i have raided on multiple private servers.
---
TBC raids were _way_ harder than vanilla though, and had a lot more gear checks. TBC was when minmaxing became a thing.
---
wowhead.com us the elite website tbh. You can find pretty much anything on that site
---
No problem :D It makes tanking a lot easier, heck it even makes soloing a bit easier too
---
Why are they only gnomes and dwarves? For stone form and escape artist? Or just RP reasons
---
It's a debuff from the undead monsters in Wetlands. It transforms you into an undead for a few mins, among other things.
---
Don’t forget relevant professions!
---
To be fair, the apothecary doesn't send you to kill innocents. He just asks you to steal it from the syndicate who have already harvested it 🤷‍♂️
---
Some world first boss kills in TBC were done with a mix and match of 67-70 as well.
---
&gt;Because of information available. Im not saying that we are physically better than we were. I can guarantee you that 15 years ago at least 90% of the playerbase were clickers. 
---
LOL what?!?!? People would laugh at people who still clicked skills, this statement is just not based on reality. I didn't know anyone in our guild who clicked, you just pulled this statement out of thin air.
---
&gt;Many many people didnt even know what a rotation was let alone the right rotation. Same goes for BiS lists, stat prioriy etc
---
Again - this is simply not true. The internet, forums etc existed a long time before wow came out. Many people wouldn't have known those things because they were casual players, the same thing is true for retail.
---
Your entire argument is based off of comparing elite players in retail playing @ 144 fps to casual players in classic who didn't even raid. It's a ridiculous argument.  People in the top 5 guilds on popular servers would have to prove they had well above average dps/healing/threat control in order to even get a spot.  They would not be able to do this @ 15 fps or with massive input lag, you would be well behind.
---
Nah APES always get the first kill on raid bosses on pservers, this is just the usual
---
Sooooooo, what's your reaction ?
---
We were different back then. Hardly anyone min/maxed. Most people didn't use basics like dps meters, and while there were guides people were mostly restricted by gear and organizing players. 
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just take it at your own pace and enjoy what your progression is.
---
That's hilarious! Recently had a Horde camping a quest NPC in Drustvar, killing Alliance. I fought him a few times as a Rogue and vanished shortly before he could finish the job everytime. He would chicken me, act like he was leaving and attack me again when I wanted to continue the quest. At one point I just sat around in stealth for a few minutes around him, and when he ganked some poor priest doing the same quest I got out of stealth and we ganged up on him. He couldn't run away, so he ended up disconnecting instead. That almost had me in tears laughing and the priest and me quested together for a few hours afterwards. Lovely experience.
---
This is spot on!!
---
It can take up to 24 hours before your order completes and the game recognizes you're subbed.
---
If you still have problems after that, it's better to open a ticket, those kind of ticked are usually answered fast.
---
None of those will be a challenge by the time they’re released. Source: downed all that content one shot day one of bwl/aq40/naxx.
---
!remindme 90 days
---
The undead sailors in wetlands give the debuff that turns you into one of them for a little bit. You can see the debuff under his buffs.
---
SIN representing. 
---
Saw this on the Discord!
---
So with 10 people you get the same exp but 5x faster? How is this even possible with raid exp reduction?
---
Did you put this up on a shelf?
---
Is it viable? Sure. Is it optimal? No. If you're in a guild and they're familiar with you and your play style, it won't be an issue. But it's still suboptimal. Which means that warriors tanking will always be the optimal route, but it's certainly possible and viable to have a bear tank.
---
For a Noob from /r/all thats fascinated with all the Hype,

blood for the blood god skulls for the skull throne .. oh wait wrong game

Exactly
---
Mc has never been mechanically hard, but people need to keep in mind that it took close to 120 hours of play , see how many days you'll need to pull this . 9h raid in greens for people like this, at least 3 to 4 raid nights if you can reach that level of skills, 2 to 3 weeks maybe if not for most guilds.
---
That is not incorrect.
---
I got a Greater Magic Wand at 13 and it was doing more damage than Mind Blast. I still used MB as an opener, just out of habit and to stay in that habit, and once it upgraded it was more damage. SWP seems so weak compared to my wand, but good for runners I guess.
---
takes 0 skill yet on even playfield the time difference between kills is gonna be measured in days rather than hours at this rate XD
---
Bump
---
Never played ally. Are there any dungeons I should do as a druid? Can I heal dungeons?
---
Mostly because they don't use mana.
---
Are you actually this stupid or just pretending ?
---
Luckily I made friends with a dude in highschool with 4 brothers and hella cousins etc that have a group we run. They got all the lord of the rings names. But ya the aoe mob farming is strong.
---
I haven't played WoW for 24 hours... because that'd be *too* long.
---
No they didn’t
---
Thanks, good to know!
---
any1 got this in the right format?
---
No they haven't lol.
---
They just played the game, saw they could clear rag and did it lol
---
Actually priests don't have that bad of a time with 2 mobs in my experience. Shadow word pain on both, then wand the shit out of one of them. When your HP goes to half, bubble yourself and heal, repeat wand + bubble + heal cycle and you're good!
---
Very dependent on weapons to do decent damage, don't get kidney shot until 30, and the best level spec is combat, which isn't great for pvp.
---
The Scarlet Crusade doesn't just kill the undead. If you're remotely in the way of killing undead, they'll kill you too. If you question them, they'll kill you. If they have to kill some night elves to kill some undead, they don't care they'll kill them all

BotW is the best Switch-era game so far, but not representative of the general trend of Nintendo games recently. I mean heck it's literally the oldest Switch game.

Because you can attack at range with them without using mana, if you’ve got any left of course.
---
Classic is a massive circlejerk right now. It isn't without merit, the game is very fun and pushes all the right nostalgia buttons (all the people saying "OMG I'M HOME! I LOVE THIS!"), but anytime you have a circlejerk, people will naturally push back against it.
---
Neither game is right or wrong. They're different. If you have 12 hours a day to play video games and don't care that all of the content is just old stuff we already know everything about, Classic will be great for you. If you want to log in, get playing some content immediately, and log off not really caring for the "social experience", then retail will be more fun.
---
I'd finish everything in duskwood. Run gnomeragon if you haven't plus the quests for that. 
---
Northern STV is a good place to go after. If you aren't comfortable there yet then more dungeons or mob farming is always an option
---
This ..maybe its a US thing ...never heard vc till now.
---
Bet you feel real superior after this comment lmao
---
Daddy got the eggs
---
It took them 100 hours of play not 120.
---
Why? You probably wont even enter the raid let alone kill a boss.
---
Nolifers
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Just because people have come up with more effective leveling methods does not mean that those new methods should be nerfed. It makes questing easier for those who want to go that route by removing a portion of players. Win-win in my book.
---
Jubei'thos was released an entire year before TBC, around 1.9 (AQ).
---
Crown of destruction and onslaught girdle. Dunno about tier.
---
As a fellow noob I've found www.classic.wowhead.com to be good enough for my needs, has pretty much everything you want including leveling guides, individual guest guides, professions info, map info, also tons of tips and community comments on where to find whatever you're looking for in the game and how best to do things. In the search bar you can just type in anything you want to know, such as "rogue leveling guide", or the name of a quest, spell or weapon and it'll give you the relevant info or recipe, super useful and comprehensive. There's many other sites out there with good info but this has been great for me so far, good luck!
---
Or we could just let Blizzard fix the AH since we all agree that the base AH is terrible?
---
not gonna lie, im that dps or healer who pulls more for the tank if i see he is going too slow trying to be careful, but i do keep an eye on his hp, and healers mana, or if im healer, ill do what i can handle, otherwise, i let them do their thing
---
Al the more reason not to use it.
---
People claim they want the pure experience but then this stuff happens.
---
I know all those things existed and im not saying that the top players didnt know about it. I said the AVERAGE player. I can think of many many people back in the day who were clueless about those things. But today? I know no one. Not saying they dont exist but they are a lot rarer

A week played seems like an understatement for the average joe

In EQ, Warriors have always been the Chosen Ones for raid tanking, and if uppity Paladins or Shadowknights ever think about taking some Warrior's job as raid main tank, there is a massive bitch storm from Warrior mains who are the only ones entitled to the position, as decreed by some guy 20 years ago.
---
Fortunately in modern EQ the two knights are capable tanks, just a bit less beefy than Warriors.

The elementals in silithus. Takes like 2 hours with layering abuse, about 5-6 hours without

I think I want some of the class design changes from TBC.  I definitely want my TBC druid.  I like the "1/3 of healing added to spell damage" as well.    
---
      
---
And they HAVE to scrap the Vanilla PvP honor system.  If you google anybody talking about it anywhere, it's almost nothing but comments about how its toxic fucking garbage.  It's literally impossible to get top ranks without either making very very very unhealthy life choices, or cheating and having multiple people play your account.    
---
That being said, there was definitely some some terrible changes in TBC.  Flying mounts were a fucking garbage change that killed any remaining world PvP.  Everybody of both factions just hangs out in Shat all day because Blizzard was too lazy to make multiple cities.  Everybody sets their hearth to shat and occasionally takes one of the permanent portals back to a capital for something.  You just sit in shat waiting for your BG or Arena to pop, or occasionally take your flying mount to an instance just by pointing yourself in the direction, and turning on auto"run" (fly) until you are there.    
---
     
---
Essentially, the entire "World" part of world of warcraft just starts to feel like a ridiculously over elaborate lobby once you are done leveling up.  The whole game is just various instanced activities.
---
Thanks eh fellow Canadian! Go leafs go buddy!
---
I love dps, and healing. What should I go for, and what profession?
---
That's how I feel about this subject, but yet I understand that it's my subjective experience.
---
Hahaha you're all over this thread being salty as fuck. It's getting pretty pathetic dude.
---
Shiny achievments.
---
Yes they have:

[APES have been training for Classic Server first in Lights Hope for ages.](https://www.google.com/search?q=apes+light%27s+hope&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enGB610GB610&amp;oq=apes+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l2j69i61j69i57j69i61.2707j0j4&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8)
---
Do the normal dungeons you'd do, none are involved in class quests.
---
Yes, and yes. I'm currently tanking every dungeon I do because there's a lack of people willing to tank, and it's going fine. Usually a good idea to hotkey skull and put it on something to try to make people focus on that, since AoE threat isn't much of a thing.
---
A couple of hours , 5 days, that's 10h, you can't be 30, so you played much more than that :D ! You are lying to yourself so you don't have the truth, you are hooked like the rest of us
---
How unspectacular, lol. :D I still remember the struggle back in the days to go through mc. Now one week after release it's already been cleared. And I'm sitting here not even having the level to do deadmines. ♥
---
This is why not having nameplates appear from so far away is awesome. Makes shit like this possible and awesome.
---
you missed the point. The point was how you define "stay". I define it by twitch number go ahead and give a better definition.
---
"they" didn't get destroyed because "they" weren't participating. It's not as if Esfand is a member of Method, is it?
---
World first again. There you go fixed it for you.
---
Yeah they changed it from 55. I was 55 last night, attuned and could enter no problem. That's the old system basically.
---
Well they were wrong.
---
Playing the game is not the same as planning to do week 1 rag..
---
Maybe you only play the game for to advertise your shit videos but other people here actually just play the game because they enjoy it.
---
Healer mana wasn't infinite with pots until 1.10 and the healer mana patch (9% reduced heal mana costs accross the board) and 12.5% healing speed buff allowing you to actually use the more mana efficient heals.
---
Before that patch a mana pot would only give you like 5 more casts, or ~10 more seconds of healing with a 2 minutes cooldown.
---
Raids would stack healers for a reason.
---
Of course there wasn't nearly as much theorycrafting so people on top of that would manage their mana like shit, like priests stacking int so they can throw more flash heals, things like that.
---
And people would simply take more damage due to stupidity.
---
It all added up and that's why bosses didn't need an enrage timer: healer mana was the timer.
---
Im so happy mcconell streams
---
TBC instances, raids and PvP is a lot more refined, more difficult and skill requiring. Also fun with more specs being viable. 
---
However, other than that, I agree with you. I'd love to see the OSRS-route, but with some specs also being made more viable (like in TBC).
---
I mean, all of the new bosses are balanced for action bar. I'm too shit at rs3 to even get a single rax kill.in
---
Immolate dot dot wand. repeat
---
That's how they play private servers day in and day out.
---
ISEEDEADPEOPLE
---
I just hit 17g today at lvl 27. Think I'm doing quite well!
---
Because they hosted the event where somel of the players present were trying for world first. Method doesn't even have a guild in classic. And most of the players there aren't even a part of Method, there's players from Cloud, 100T, Liquid and even a couple of Path of Exile streamers.
---
It's too early to make money selling crafted stuff, the game is been out for less than a week and most people don't have money yet.
---
You have to wait until the economy is more established.
---
Yeah but in retail its a 50/50 shot whether or not they have warmode on lol.
---
The fortniters will leave in due time, they won't make the grind to 60. 
---
Can't wait for the assholes who still don't invite because of class to leave too. It's 2019 we shouldn't be having class racism anymore. We know what we're doing in the raids we should be able to take whoever and whatever.
---
METH OMEGALUL D
---
I mean, it's not like these are new bosses. I remember the strats for all these bosses. That's all it takes are people to not fuck up the strats.
---
This
---
Find a guild that plays how you want to
---
Their dps is usually pretty high, if you keep getting new wands, making them a great damaging ability for no mana cost.
---
Some NA servers maybe, but not either one that I played back then.  DM was what we used and for Dire Mail, we used a direction.  DME or whatever.
---
They've done this last week on a Private Server. And the week before. And the one before that. 
---
This is routine for them; the damage numbers are just different.
---
Lol, didn't want gear. SFK cloth drops are good for like 15+ levels.
---
&gt; I love it as it is.
---
&gt; AH was always better with auctioneer.
---
Pick one.
---
This is correct, we did dungeons.
---
Lol they made a whole event out of it. So they were going for it
---
Most people who get to 60 without a guild to raid with will never complete the raids because a pickup group is nothing close to APE or other hardcore guilds
---
Just to give you some perspective. Even blizzard said back then that only a tiny percent of the playerbase even entered a raid. I think it wqs like 10% or even less. You know what that means?that the average player in vanilla never raided
---
They've been doing this week in week out for the past years on private servers. Apart from the damage numbers, this is nothing new to them.
---
I was just thinking that. Like, shouldn't he be grown up?
---
I don't know about the Wetlands but I killed 3 horde in Ashenvale earlier today, one of those was a 1v2.
---
I’m waiting to get home from my vacation to start playing. Will MacBook Pro (2015) be doable you think? What settings do you use, any lag?
---
So the same as classic?
---
Umm, what are you even on about?
---
That guy sounds like a massive shithead.
---
gtfo
---
We all already know what the intent was the only people that act like they don't are the ones exploiting the system.
---
They have you kill a dog and live test a poison on PoWs. Fucking undeads, man.
---
Atlas loot classic has all but quest and maps. Atlas quest is AFAIK still not updated, but apparantly its being worked on
---
Picture this, a level 18 mage doing the lower level quests in redridge, he walks up the path twards the gnoll camps. Out of fucking nowhere 2 orc hunks jump out from behind a roc, they quickley tear his man dress and double team him leaving nothing more than a shriveled mass of torn cloth.
---
Welcome to World of Warcraft! Enjoy the adventure
---
Nice grats on lvl 20
---
:^)
---
Good for you!
---
Tribe said something like that on his stream just after the Ragnaros kill. He was really looking forward to getting Onyxia done so he could just go to sleep and not worry about when to wake up or if there'd be a queue when he did. He also said he'd been awake for over 30 hours at that point.
---
For tailoring you dont need any gathering prof - you farm from mobs almost everything you need. 
---
So you have access to many green items for disenchating.
---
this is the reason i didnt hop on lower pop servers. there is a reason 99% of the vanilla stories goes like this "i didnt hit 60 until tbc".
---
greater magic wand is like a wmd at the level you get it, its insane how much faster it makes leveling a priest paired with wand spec.
---
[Wrong.  This has been planned for ages](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2503841-Avoiding-alliance-guild-quot-Apes-quot-on-EU-PVP-realms) 
---
If you have any evidence to back up your nonsense, post it.
---
What level are you? Wands are a huge power spike if you get them as early as possible (level 5), but otherwise they're just pretty good dps that doesn't cost mana. In my opinion it's less of a big deal on mages because of conjure food and most important to rush for on priests.
---
I need macro for switching 1h weapon and shield to 2H and vice versa, i need it to use shield slam in pvp and also healer npcs.. Played WoW from the start but did not learn macros like never..
---
Not to mention the roll backs :S
---
The average-joe will still learn the content/mechanics much faster than back then. By definition MC mechanics ain't hard, but they're not very forgiving, so if you fuck up, it usually means a wipe.
---
The average-joe still have:
---
1.12 talents.
---
1.12 spell coefficients.
---
1.12 itemization.
---
16 debuff slots.
---
2019 knowledge vs. 2004/2005 knowledge.
---
Any decent guild will have people read a few guides and at that point, it'll be your average UBRS run, with the exception of Ragnaros.
---
People have to stop making 2004 raids harder than they were, especially these entry raids.
---
The classic community is truly showing its 'best' side in the comments here, LOL.
---
About your experience, these are all relevant challenges, which requires cooperation to overcome (the right kind of cooperation). You just emphasised several important reasons of making friends in this game. 
---
And yes, the progress is slow in Classic. There's less "instant gratification", for better or worse. My best advice would be to explore the game and worry less about efficiency.
---
You are right if changed everything ...
---
APES or maybe Salad bakers is gonna get every world first in classic, honestly non private server guilds doesn't stand a chance. They've been speed running the game for years already and know every pull you can skip etc.
---
I was addicted as a teen but I just don't have it anymore. I can log off anytime something else comes up.
---
Lol yeah act like my given example isn't considering your dumb point.  Thats how you win an e-argument.
---
Which addon they are using for raids?
---
As a healer I would like something to help me see teammates easily (specially with class since I will do dungeon with randoms and I want to see their class/role to know how to prioritize in healing)
---
"Resist" is just a "miss" in that sense.
---
lol I remember leveling up an alt with a friend during TBC, and everybody was going all hardcore on these low level dungeons like they were 70 heroics or something.  it's like they forgot how much easier they are.     
---
    
---
You could just bulldoze them with a bunch of locks and hunters and one DPS class who could throw out the occasional heal.  I cleared all of wailing caverns pretty easily with just 2 locks and a priest.  I did all of SM Lib except the boss with one hunter and one priest.  But then you try and get a group together and people would freak out if it wasn't perfect max level meta.
---
I never saw VC in the US during vanilla.  Honestly the first time that I saw it was after the rework of the dungeon in like 2013.
---
Surely moving to US or EU has gotta be a better option for you OCE players.
---
Literally says "World First" in the stream title lmao.
---
And?
---
Thank you
---
thats very sad. If you come to alliance we will welcome you and mail you bags, pots and food.
---
&gt; Vanilla WoW was harder than you think, guys.
---
It was pretty easy compared to its predecessors
---
The fuck does this prove? lmao
---
I'm in a discord with apes, they haven't planned shit.
---
I mean at least they streamed so we can see what’s going on and what they’re doing. Who knows what The world first people did and how they managed cause they sure as hell aren’t transparent about it. It’s just a bit suspicious that’s all. For all we know they could have just account shared the entire time.
---
Yesterday I was so overwhelmed with the barrens and bored of the landscape that I traveled to the ashen vale, did one quest and dearly missed the scorching hot landscape and hundreds of players, so I returned and now I enjoy it so much more again haha
---
To be fair, method has quite a few world firsts. True they weren't able to get this one, but you they've proven repeatedly that they are capable of getting those world first achievements
---
They were right. This game will be dead in 3 months.
---
amazing!!
---
Retail gave us WotLK, an expansion loved by the most people yet. I don't get this argument. How can you possibly jump from classic to WoD. It seems so absurd to me. So what if it eventually becomes unlikeable. There's a decade of good content that can be improved upon.
---
Cya retard
---
A friend has this, AFAIK its becouse hes on a account that has lower priority (but we cant tell for sure) accounts such as trial accounts are overprioritiezed by normal accounts in queues. But its really hard to find a good solid source to why this is happening.
---
We are hooing his account swiftly gets flagged normal after paying his sub. Supposidly it should be hisnaccount from 2004,but he hasmt played it since 2006 or so. We cannot tell for sure since he dont remember if its his original account.
---
If anyone has more solid info, please share as we wanna know to
---
I think you’re missing the point and under selling trailblazers as a whole. But, to each their own.
---
https://youtu.be/UneS2Uwc6xw
---
Mine also. Makes me laugh.
---
There are more guilds than just Method.
---
I outright refuse to play mage in classic because the late game straight up forces you into spamming Frostbolt and nothing more, this is due to 2 reasons:
---
- The Debuff limit preventing you from using spells that apply any kind of debuff (because other raid members will need to take those slots)
---
- Fire resist: Molten Core, BWL and Ony all have mobs/bosses with massive fire resist and thus you cannot raid as fire spec (Least not until AQ and Naxx)
---
Every raid that is yet to come out will be cleared less than tan two hours after release. 
---
ZG, AQ, Naxx—the fact that people are gunning for it and have the release times to farm up proper gear (contrary to MC because they used whatever gear they had when they dinged 60) means they'll be waiting at the entrances for the server reboot and do exactly what they've been doing for the past years on private servers.
---
A lot of them have mental disabilities
---
I swear
---
A streamer got world first mc rag and lvl60 what do you mean?
---
Really abomb is leaking on this subreddit now? for anyone that doesnt know he is a well know **TROLL** on the arena forums and the wow forums in general so dont mind him

---
Trust me when I say that it is not an issue for a hunter, especially for questing.
---
Even later on in Wrath I raided ICC on 3G connection with 450-500ms in the middle of the woods. Was still top dps because MM was a literal /castsequence rotation after applying hunters mark and serpent sting.
---
Because it was this way in Classic. It's part of the experience. People used addons back then, too. This won't change.
---
Priests get inspirtation too, right? that armor buff alone make a huge difference.
---
And another thing. Sorry for another reply. I just font want you to miss the edit.
---
&gt;People in the top 5 guilds on popular servers would have to prove they had well above average dps/healing/threat control in order to even get a spot.
---
I assume you are familiar with Kungen and Nihilum. Even he said that in nihilum there were only like 20 really good players and the rest were rsther average and many wipes happenef because of those lesser skilled players. Even mentioned a particular episode where he gkicked someone in naxxramas
---
Because he made the same mistake 2 or 3 times when the boss wqs really lowm and it wasnt s trial member, he had been i nihilum for a while and made all the progress with them in naxx till that point
---
jesus thats sweaty
---
My experience so far is that I’m always broke as a warlock.
---
This sub started out so great and is rapidly devolving into one big circlejerk :/  
---
This comment section alone is one big dumpsterfire of elitists
---
That sounds like a great idea! Thank you.
---
Who gives a shit about a sense of status? What? You want there to be a fucking peaking order on the server? Jesus christ people will do anything to feel better about themselves.
---
I’m sorry your feelers got hurt.
---
Thanks! That's all I needed to know. Too bad for my wallet but eh it's manageable. Also interesting to see someone who knows (I'm assuming by your name) what Gothic series is. Warms my heart
---
...is this your first time on reddit? What were you expecting to find here?
---
No one ever fucking said DM alone for Dire Maul. VC noobs are stupid.
---
Did you ever consider that this world first went to people who spent the last fifteen years min/maxing and optimizing these fights while method has consistently gotten world firsts on new content with each passing expansion?
---
There should be 1 in the park yea
---
It's absolutely worth it. As others have noted you can charge a fee to open people's lockboxes. It can be used to unlock doors in dungeons. It's a big part of your class identity as a rogue as well. To truly immerse yourself into the character you'll want to level it. Not to mention it is a great way to make friends in dungeons, your guild, and some good passive income while you're hanging out in a big city.
---
I have a pet passive macro on my warlock. I also have a pet attack one that puts him back on defensive. `/petdefensive` should do it. 
---
For PVP, if it takes a second to drop combat and you are attacked in this time, it might keep you from dropping combat. 
---
If there is a delay in FD removing you from combat, that's going to screw stuff up.
---
Psycho
---
People will get tired of vanilla eventually, perhaps after they clear BWL and "finish" what they wanted to do. I believe this subreddit will start demanding TBC in 2 years instead of classic+.
---
Hunters mark I think. I forget if that is retail version but yeah
---
I started today and I got 3 6 slot bags within the hour. I don't know why but it made me feel like a god damn champion.
---
I suggest looking into drain tanking. Improves your uptime by a ton
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Frostbolt. The rotation is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the button pushes will go over a typical player's head. There's also Rag's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these Frostbolts, to realise that they're not just Frost- they say something deep about BOLTS. As a consequence people who dislike Frostbolt truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rag's existential catchphrase "DIE, INSECT" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chris Metzen's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Frostbolt tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
---
No
---
Private server, boy. They've been doing this fight for years. Probably done it last week—not to practice even, but just because.
---
Scan the AH
---
I actually needed this comment. Feels like everyone's racing and I'm chilling at level 15 taking my time :)
---
Gotta represent
---
Yup due to the time investment required.
---
Levelling was made easier and you can now simply pay to skip past 90% of the levelling experience. People who used to never progress past 5 mans are now the equivalent of people who do low tier raids in retail. If anything this points to the average raider in retail being worse than people who actually invested the time to get to raid level in vanilla.
---
Holy shit. Dont worry bro. Most of the classic player are chill. Implaying with my wife and we have a newborn daughter so we need to afk every now and then during dungeons and no one had bad mouthed at us so far.
---
&gt;TBC has had the longest surviving bosses in wow history
---
oh yeah, the bosses which were so bugged they were literally impossible.
---
You know people speedleveling are enjoying themselves too right? Just in a different way
---
No changes would have meant classic starting with 1.0 itemization and gradually change it in phases.
---
Respawn timer is the real enemy here, yeah.
---
No but it is a processor heavy game, you could lag out if there were too many spell effects, people, or whatever and that would screw things up.
---
People say a lot of stupid shit. But I am pretty sure I have never seen even a single person saying that Classic raiding was harder than even normal raids or a +7 in retail.
---
Mograine is great.

---
What you even talking about? That's one guild on one server. And why does that mean that the staff would be worth any less? Raids in classic give such little loot its probably still an upgrade for some of the people in the world first guild.
---
Oh no
---
Well I understand why you did it back in the day, but nowdays with so much knowledge of farming gold spending 30 dollars for 50g would be just sad. 50g is 2 hours of farming mobs as a level 49 and selling stuff on AH, or 2 hours od fishing
---
Only APES had 15 years to prepare?
---
Figures. Makes sense. Good logic.
---
You're well ahead of the pack. I'm not surprised people in your level range just want to grind quick.
---
*laughs in strong trollsblood*
---
Made a gold selling it in tarren mill
---
Captan America meme: no, I don’t think I will
---
Na just laughing at people trying to act all high and mighty because a guild they aren't in killed rag.
---
Do you know if the actual OG AtlasLoot is back? I have "AtlasLoot Classic" but it's kinda trash, it uses modern AtlasLoot categorization.
---
\-You can't search professions by training level or skill level (apprentice, expert, etc), only by item category
---
\-You can't search pre-60 sets, legendaries, world BoEs or similar stuff on Collections anymore.
---
\-You can't search mounts, pets or tabards.
---
\-Scarlet Monastery is shown as a single, 11 boss dungeon for some reason.
---
\-You can't search world events. 
---
\-You can't search world bosses.
---
I loved AtlasLoot but I'm pretty disappointed by the new one.
---
tbc has arena
---
No one in the history of the world has claimed MC is hard.
---
And all the hate for meme specs "who will never get into a raid"
---
This right here. back in vanilla raid turned off exp and quests.
---
can you check EU? this is interesting
---
I used to play on from release for years and excessive back in those days. A couple of the old friends picked up on classic but personally and realistically I can't afford the time with a full time job, girlfriend and dog plus sports even if the time would allow it'd be considerably less so casual level and for the casuals it could be better without.
---
It always comes down to personal time one can spend but there's also the streaming which is around nowadays. Wouldn't it be interesting to see some of them struggle and work for the kills? Can't imagine it was entertaining to see them running through without any real satisfaction due to lack of sleep and well its nothing special for them.
---
I'm gone for 5-6 years so that's an outsiders opinion. Just remember my vanilla time and the excitement in progressing.
---
Should have thought of Igor and Tyler, I have Kanye already
---
The warlock and warrior ones were too real. Ouch.
---
Well your quest to stop it hitting the frontpage failed and the mods have deemed this appropriate for the sub. Maybe go moderate your own subreddit?
---
A week? More like a month :)
---
It is yeah. Classic is just something I've been looking forward to for at least 3 years.
---
What's levelling as a prot warrior like, and how does it do in pvp? I'm interested in the spec because I used to main fury and I want to do something different, but arms feels kind of bland. PvP prot warrior sound interesting and different, but if it has damage issues or is just bad, or if it's a nightmare to level, I'd prefer to know now.
---

a friend of mine has already quit because he couldn't stand being so poor, i tried to tell him that its gets better and to just keep on looting and vendering trash but hes so used to just rolling in gold on retail he couldn't handle the stress of not being to just afford bags/spells lol.
---
Well lets see what his other choices were without mouse, oh wait
---
The nights definitely are not dark enough to be true to vanilla. Night time in vanilla WoW was actually dark. And it made places like Duskwood much creepier. I loved it.
---
Jokerd streamed the whole thing I believe, there's vods out there.
---
They must use some form of satellite internet right?
---
I'd Imagine the theoretical speeds would be higher on a plane and the latency lower because the signal has to travel less distance.
---
&gt;no one has been practising and refining there strategy for 15 years dude... cmon. you could walk into mc as a 40 man raid with no one knowing what the bosses do and you will one shot every boss.
---
Let's see someone do that then, because the people who did it today have been grinding MC on Pservers for years and years.
---
Well congratulations, you belong to group of people, who made classic worse than it could be
---
Those are the retail folk who think they can rush through a dungeon and do what they normally do.
---
I play as a pally healer and I have had my share of people I want to strangle.
---
Worse is you can have a whole conversation about it but they just keep doing it the same way.
---
However having said that sometimes you get a group of people who know what they are doing and it is a breeze.
---
Here's the probem - the general playerbase is still woefully misinformed about the best ways of playing the game. Like, you seem to think that the best way to tackle Rag is to get a full 40 group with UBRS fire resist gear? Stacking fire resist is a garbage strategy, you want to stack the best DPS gear and hopefully even kill Rag before he submerges.
---
Tool is amazing, and I was very pleasantly surprised with new Slipknot.
---
To add to the list, new Dark Crystal series!
---
I work with low capacity autistic children, so something must've rubbed off ;)
---
They are hardly 60 either lol
---
From my experience dungeon mobs hardly do any damage if you are only tanking 1 even if you are wearing cloth so in my experience the tank puts a skull on one target and just lets all the dps attack that one while one of them tanks it. Until that target is dead you should have enough threat built up on the other mobs.
---
If you don't want dps to ever tank then you have to tell them to wait for threat on every mob.
---
Because it's not a single player game and it's not about the "content".
---
Horde on Gehennas will soon find out why they've played vanilla for so long. I decided to roll Gehennas because it's the Scandinavian server, but I almost want to go to another one since I'm alliance and APES are here. Might ruin the experience.
---
Some died in that fight, for one, and also the fight took much longer than it does with proper gear. But when you get the mechanics down (which to every private server raider is like breathing at this point), then everyone will barely take any damage, so it's just a matter of following tactics until the HP bar drops to Zero. 
---
That's it. 
---
Proper gear speeds up the kill with more damage and allows for more mistakes with more HP and mana, but it all comes down to doing what needs to be done until the HP bar goes poof.
---
I've been playing like 3-5 hours a night and I'm not level 30 yet either. Most of my guild members who are higher level took time off work to play. Taking time off work to play a game is definitely not casual in my eyes.
---
What’s Retail like right now after the launch of Classic? Is it dead with people off trying Classic?
---
Have you marked targets?
---
should I drop all quests and head to next zone when I get to highest level of current zone?
---

---
Essentially you 8-10 man ZF doing massive AOE pulls and reset the dungeon by everyone logging out and a bank alt on a 2nd account resetting the dungeon as raid leader. You do the same with SM, BRD and LBRS.
---
The authentic vanilla experience! Keep at it, in the later levels people will have gotten their bearings on how to behave in a dungeon group
---
Hahahaha check out this loser having a normal productive life
---
For DW Fury, what weapon speeds am I looking for? Do I want two slow 1 handers or Slow main fast offhand like Rogue?
---
I have, actually.
---
From what I understand your spec won't matter until late AQ40 and Naxx. Molten Core always has been easy. the challenge is to get 40 People together paying attention long enough to clear the raid.
---
People are a lot better at video games than they were back in the days. Don't worry about your class and spec, worry about playing it well and a guild or group will pick you up to fill their ranks.
---
Private server players aren't the best until they prove that officially and make a name for themselves in Classic. ***What they did on a Private servers the past 10 years means nothing. It really doesn't.** Not sure how anyone can think it does mean something. A bunch of randoms in a private venue against no competition.
---
***The best of the best are players winning tournaments. The players on Blizzcon stages. The players with paid sponsors like Method. The players that have made a name for themselves. You know whats the word I am looking for here... Oh that's right "Professional" players.***
---
Do we have a stat on autopilot/zigor usage/download
---
That's true, but I doubt it to be honest. Probably still focus everything on retail
---
Lol yup 
---
"Its toooooooo haaaaaaaaard" 
---
Bah bye!
---
Horde: Windfury Shaman w/ 2Her
---
Alliance: Ret Paladin for lols
---
Both: Priest
---
Professions vary based on class.
---
Nope, you've not really helped me at all. I have nothing to welcome you for....
---
Thanks for the waste of time though!
---
That is true, but I was more concerned that I maybe won't keep up with the phases and stuff.
---
Sounds like it's hard.
---
crazy how people can have 2 different opinions on 2 different topics
---
Lol at this line of thinking
---
More dots!
---
You don't stick to walls in this game, but a lot of rounded edged mountains are really easy to shimmy your way up.  
---
IF airport should always be accessible by slow falling from the graveyard with enough speed as well, it never required wall sticks.
---
Method are newbies compared to pserver guilds
---
1. Group up
---
2. Kill mobs your own level to level up
---
3. Hop zones. This will be the answer even more so later on. Zones don't always have quests to nicely take you from 10-20 or 20-30
---
I have this problem, but it’s my cat always forcing herself into my lap. And if I don’t move my keyboard she’ll plop onto it. Really annoying when I’m healing in a dungeon or raid and have to move everything! Haha.
---
Are you the guy I was talking to on Herod? If not, he also has Father and Zaddy as his alts
---
He is definitely wrong about pve, but about pvp when you see people say « I was gladiator on *random private server* » I laugh a lot.
---
Skinning/lw or herb/alch for a shaman, enh leveling, resto endgame
---
Dude you are just sad at this point, just take the L and move on.
---
It's not a matter if seems so or not.
---
It's just not possible since it's been done 15 years ago.
---
You cant claim a world first anything if it's already been done.
---
I played classic at release and it **felt** hard at the time. But compared to the actual retail wow raids (especially mythic) the classic raids were a complete joke.
---
Great player, terrible designer.
---
Good. Fuck em. They're just taking up space in the queue. We have more than enough people.
---
No idea. Is that a thing? Can that even be done?
---
In the long run I dont think that is the best option, I already tried that. But thank you.
---
That’s the default icon for when there is none available for that action or spell.
---
Oh I guess I'm just a noob and didn't know specific names of loot off hand.
---
I haven't deleted any post im aware of?
---
By asking a question pretty much summons up that youre all ear for ideas and the answers that comes with it.
---
Are you ok? Haha
---
Hey man he's not hurting anyone leave him be
---
[Welcome brother ](https://discord.gg/9jjbdA) :&gt;
---
Nice grats dude!
---
I’ve been playing on a “recycled” byte speed small form computer with 4 gigs of ram.
---
Well I mean it doesn’t have to be long term, just until you get past the bits which are giving you issues
---
Isn’t it?
---
I got lil Timmy's peashooter from a gnoll
---
Yes I have done all the lower levels. I will try that. Thank you
---
not agreeing with the op, but i mean ofc they are saying they didn't plan shit. just like the nerd in class thats always getting straight A's, but is also claiming he didn't even study for it.
---
those are also the guys that took the whole mafia thing to the next level, they also didn't plan that?
---
If you play a meme spec you should be treated like a meme nuff said.
---
Ouch sucks. Put him in your ignore list.   
---
And remember his name? Maybe put just his name here.
---
not everyone is apes, we will see.
---
Okay well the onslaught girdle is a sick plate belt, best belt for warriors until naxx comes out. 
---
The crown of destruction is a mail helmet that gives crit and attack power, very nice for pvp warriors and hunters.
---
Mageblade is the best weapon for mages until BWL, Spellpower ring gives a lot of spellpower duh :D
---
15
---
There's a lot to take in here
---
&gt; but the time played on the characters doing the world first will still be in the hundreds of hours
---
even 4 days ago this was short sighted and ignorant
---
hundreds of hours played to down MC? lmao
---
Yeah I remember that.   
---
fellow priest
---
Nah man, same battle.net account, you can just add multiple subscriptions. It's really convenient.
---
idk just seems better than nothing and I don't think OCE has that bad ping on EU cause i've played with a few in the past.
---
That's like asking why F1 drivers want to drive so fast instead of enjoying the scenery.
---
No they won't. They might wipe occasionally but nobody will actually struggle with MC.
---
Why?
---
It's not
---
I've never understood why people care about these speed running things.  I'd could maybe get it if it was an extremely skill based game like a souls game where any wrong move and your fucked, but this is just no lifers playing the game all day long.
---
They would have needed 5 days of time off basically to do what they did. Don't need to be unemployed for that really. ;)
---
Friends. See WoW Classic as a game with great gameplay and superb social element. This social element has, in the last decade, been slowly stripped from games so that people do not knit friendships, so that they easier migrate to newer titles.
---
What kind of server are you on? Ashkandi was nice enough, and i've been on the RP server recently, and it's been nothing but niceness.
---
Also did this and found out around 14-16 lool
---
Still going strong on Gehennas EU now!
---
It's not like the raids are harder, in fact the mechanics are easier, but we're also left with fewer conveniences such as having 1 or 2 druids max, taking a while to buff up, etc. Plus everyone has done these at a time so usually familiar with the mechanics.
---
I am LVL12 and enjoying the game. I do not know how those people did that. I feel pity for them. I know it is not a popular opinion, but I feel pity for them.
---
If you don't want to do use it, then don't use it. I don't see why I'm being downvoted for being practical. Not everyone has unlimited time. You can still form groups and do harder content. I'll never understand why this community is so passionate to remove casual play and gatekeep end game content.
---
Can't it still be difficult? Just because a few people can do something doesn't mean it's not hard. There are ten thousands of people (probably more) who can bowl 300. Doesn't mean that it's easy for 99.99% of people.
---
Ele shamans are great at DPS, both pve and pvp
---
Please, fix the title. This is just wrong. World first Onyxia in WoW:Classic, yes. Not world first Onyxia. This is just plain wrong and an insult to raiders from 15 years ago.
---
Why not just put it in proper context, they grinded hard and worked through content easily.
---
But please don't pretend this is the vanilla wow experience. 
---
Back then servers often had 150-250+ latency for people, they weren't getting 200fps, they weren't playing on 1.12 when these raids were relevant, and obviously they didn't know everything we know about the game now.  
---
World first is world first, congratulations to APES, but holy crap some of you guys are so insecure trying to dog on vanilla, when classic is so different than vanilla was in so many ways.
---
We did Onyxia, when we were bored or stole an ID, easy with &lt;10 people back then.
---
Right, you're contradicting yourself now. Either you want the content to be challenging for everyone or you don't, which is it? 
---
Personally I'd prefer if it was challenging for everyone but I knew it wouldn't be. Vanilla raiding is very very easy.
---
After clearing k1 naxx with world buffs disabled, deliberate mob hp/damage buffs and generally higher pserver armor, comjng back to do retail mc with 1.12 talents and gear is going to be like cuddling a kitty
---
Going for blue PvP gear is probably the way to go when it gets patched in, otherwise there should be gear for enhancement shamans (or for hunters, at least that’s what they think). 
---
Prepare to be oom a lot if specced either enhancement or elemental. Also prepare to get asked to heal all the time. Shaman DPS specs aren’t really competitive and group members may question your damage output.
---
You shouldn’t care if you want to play shaman tho, it’s an awesome class and can be extremely good in PvP. Alliance cloth classes will shit their pants when they see you, your utility against casters is immense (frost mages being the trickiest). Prepare to get stomped by rogues and warriors tho.
---
*release*
---
Haha, that is so ominous. "Just let go, we will be together in Stormwind soon"
---
Turns out that wasn’t true
---
Check point #3. Now all the retail players are saying 
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You lost me at point 3. It should be clear to you that -just like with  everything else in life- experience is very important and these guys  have been tryharding vanilla for a decade. It's also obvious method  doesn't take this as serious as retail WFs
---
Why would I be in denial when what I have said for years looks to be true. Now retail players actually have competition from many people from the old playerbase, they don't look  very good at all lol. All the retail redditors are backtracking - "well they have been practising" - what's happened to all the elite skills gained from 8 years of playing harder retail content lol?
---
Exactly. It didnt annoy that me so much. XP is kinda good. And it helps us to see the world really more and see the players. And between walking to Westfall Redrigde and Stormwind 5 times, I have created the habit of my own.   
---
Walking through hostile area and finding mines. And helping the players on the way. Or even better, secretly heal them behind the bush/tree. It's all small things.
---
issue is though that I cant queue for my main char while playing said alt... so it will be just like playing on another server until queue die down enough that I give up on the alt and just wait in the lower queue? I see what you mean though but its a shitty place to be :(
---
I've always thought the consensus was that raiding wasn't all that good until Naxx at the earliest, and probably Karazhan.
---
Me at odd levels: wow I am really saving up the money
---
Me hitting an even level: aaannnndddd I'm broke
---
Cringe
---
Is your friend named Roach?
---
Legion had some of the most fun and engaging END GAME gameplay in WoW.
---
But the core of the game was still showing rot. It was still basically just a mad dash to the finish to do content at 110, instead of focusing on the journey. Case in point, mage tower. Great challenge, awesome rewards, but the fact that they would go away after a while and never come back just encouraged people like me to level multiple new characters up as quickly as possible to get all the appearances on all the classes. Even more insulting was the fact that it wasn't even that difficult to do after 7.3, so I never saw the point in removing them permanently if they were faceroll for months up until then.
---
Okay well I know them well and you don't. But yes the entire devilsaur mafia thing was well planned you could definitely say. This thing was just them discovering they leveled rly fast with their methods and decided to push it. They've done speedleveling and rag plenty of times for there to be no planning needed. Who needs to study on a test on a subject where you are already an expert?
---
If you want to help yourself, do skinning and make money so you can work towards your mount faster. You'll hate the game a lot less with 60% movespeed
---
&gt;There will never be more competition on a comparatively dead game with no money in it. 
---
The view count of Classic streamers disagree with you.
---
SW:P delivers it's damage over 18-24 seconds, but takes only one GCD to inflict. It does more damage than any other spell but you can't use it twice in that window.
---
Yeah at level 13 the wand is easily stronger than rank 1 mind blast, but that changes quickly.
---
Would you be able to post a build of it? I'm interested in trying it out. Should I focus consecration first or get it later?
---
Yes... They are hosting other streamers who are going for world first. Method themselves are not
---
I think a lot of it is because of all the dungeon grinders.  It allows people like me to have unrestricted access to every single quest mob without having to fight over them.
---
None of the dungeon loot etc is in yet, that's a later phase. Don't confuse base patch 1.12 with content
---
“nice job”
---
I thought you were joking, but I recognize some words...
---
What a bunch of no lifers
---
Look at this sub there is constant bashing against those "lazy, dumb retail players".
---
Its just 2 mentally handicapped moron-camps defending their only purpose in life, WoW. (and some meme'ing for sure)
---
Yeah we keep flitting between dungeons and quests
---
but why skulls?
---
Yep that's classic, can't wait for the next fresh tbh.
---
Nostalrius was fun as fuck sorry you missed out. No layering btw just 15k online 24 hour days in the most beautiful international clusterfuck you ever saw.
---
Yes that obscure reference to the small game wc3 that gave birth to some other small games such as Wow, dota2, hearthstone and League of legends
---
I feel your pain :(.The thing is that I met all my current friends / guildies by being solo way back when, so maybe I can do the same for the first month or so (on a different server) and then hop back (if i dont 100% like it) to original server once queue times have died down?
---
I dont know... just all my friends/guildies are like "Just queue and wait or log on at 4am and anti afk" - i cant do that shit as I have a wife / real life shit as well as full time work lol and i have shit luck so i would probs be the first to be banned for using anti afk lol
---
Same thing as Rogue. Slow main, fast offhand
---
6 here - I’ve had to sit in queue every day after work!
---
But how do you log in at the same time. Anytime I try to log into my laptop it kicks me out of the app on my pc. Sorry I'm probably being dumb.
---
God damn it how....they exploited anything ?:) Makes me think classic bosses perhaps needed some simple health/damage buff at least
---
I just said "Deadmines" and avoided the whole argument
---
Of course! How could I have been so obtuse!?!?
---
I've never played Wow and I have thousands of hours on ESO but this just seems like a childish thing to do.
---
It's like there's so many effects and so much grass that you can no longer discern anything in the environment in certain areas.
---
Always remember to keep a few Soul Stones for summoning. You'll learn about this I think the same time you get the Voidwalker.
---
If there's enemies on their own, but there's patrols nearby or they have a tendency to flee. Wand them first to draw them to a more isolated spot THEN send the Voidwalker to tank them. You see so many Hunters and Warlocks inadvertently pull extra enemies onto them and get killed because they don't pull enemies back.
---
You don't really need drink, life tap and eat to recover your health.
---
You can log into the battle.net launcher with the same account in multiple places. When you have two subs on the same account, a dropdown menu appears next to the menu that asks you which version you want to play.
---
"Death to the living"
---
Me: "Back at you bud."
---
My troll friend: 0_0
---
haha lol
---
Well not long after I found some underleveled goons wandering around and gave em what for
---
Lol at nostalgia consuming people who never grew up
---
no, talking to some random priest while grinding banal mobs doesn't sound any more fun than doing it solo
---
Aye, it’s been awesome so far! 
---
Good luck out there.
---
as a matter of fact they have been there before
---
I reject any group invite when they haven't messaged beforehand, or when the quest items drop per mob. I'll invite people for named mobs if I see them. Try your realm discord or find a guild.
---
These all sound like questions that only you can really answer. We don't know you or what you like or what you'll regret. The answer is different for everyone.
---
I never played vanilla like that back in 2004. Why do you think I'm going to play like that now? Just because that's how you played doesnt mean it's how everyone else played or how it should be played so stop trying to force your way to play down everyone elses neck.
---
Literally says "Presented by WSOE and Method" They are hosting the event, Method only have just a few from their raiding guild present, the rest is just their streamers + various people from other guilds. 
---
They only have like 1 person who was really racing for the worlds first.
---
Its only a "clickbait" because some people doesnt understand that it isnt.
---
Just do it.  You know you wanna play.
---
Alt aholic incoming play what you want
---
because they knew they were gonna be world first hours before downing rag
---
You are failing to recognize the 'Fun' part of it compared to BFA. Not to mention the server community.
---
The game isn't just about raiding and gear ya know.
---
Had a mage needing and winning smithys mace in DM so he could give it to his warrior friend. They started kicking people from the group when they got flamed.
---
You can do it ahead of time, so just send the first eight 60s to do it.
---
If you can afford it lol
---
Jesus.  It seems like an absurd amount of people on this subreddit are unable to detect sarcasm.  You think he was actually serious here?
---
Kael had invisible respawning adds, broken pyroblast timer and the best tactic for a while was tanks using casters (or healers? I don't remember)  staff active ability which was ALSO BUGGED to not be on GCD to aggro the invisible adds to them
---
also m'uru I think was considered mathematically impossible but this got thrown around a lot tbh
---
Must be a US thing. Also from EU and never heard VC on Westfall chat.
---
When I saw this meme I was wondering if OP meant that DM should always be called DM on chat instead of Dead Mines but after reading these posts it became clear what it is about.
---
My server isn’t too bad. It’s considered “high” for most of the day until peak times where it gets full but apart from a couple of quests its been pretty smooth in terms of questing
---
Just go arms. Tanks don't really have a place in PvP,  since you won't have the damage to drop people through their sustain, and aggro mechanics obviously don't apply to players.
---
Nice argument. Don't complain if u don't know how to use it.
---
Yeah I was 21-22 when I ordered this I think, I’m 36 now.
---
Wholly shit, that’s cool it’s still a thing!!!!!
---
Blizz UI is fine for healing. But big advice is to set it up near the buttom middle of your screen that's where you usually hover your mouse to heal anyway. 
---
As for raid addons, they didn't rly have much apparently the boss addons for timers and shit didn't work.
---
Come to the dark side
---
nerd ass loser is best at playing 15 year old video game that has been minmaxed to the second, who fuckin cares
---
shitty drop rates do not make something difficult ffs. grinding a million kolkars for bracers is not remotely tough, its just stupidly tedious and one of the reasons while retail is so much different. retail is 15 years of QOL changes the community bitched and moaned and whined like fucking babies for. and of course now they hate what they created to. fuck the wow playerbase, they ruin shit and still whine.
---
Skinning my man, skin everything in sight.
---
My 13 Tauren druid has almost two gold worth of light leather sitting in the bank because no one skins anything in the barrens, I just go quest and skin dead mobs along the way, easily pay for repairs and training selling the leather scraps.
---
Fellow noob here but I’ll help where I can
---
1. Both factions will definitely have a lot of guilds, some servers however will skew towards one faction. There was a survey on this subreddit before launch as to what server would have the most of each faction you could look at. But regardless you should be able to find a guild even if your a minority faction on a server.
---
2. Not sure but I’d imagine so. If you don’t really enjoy PVP though I’d highly recommend you level on a normal server and if you decide you want to try PVP you can flag for it in the world and unflag when you don’t want to do it anymore. 
---
3. I’m a bit behind as well and had no trouble at all getting a group for ragefire chasm last night. It’s good to remember that due to the massive queues a lot of people are probably only getting stayed properly now and regardless we have so many players that getting groups should be easy. Lots of us are playing slow and enjoying the ride and I’d recommend you do the same. 
---
4.  Of those I think warlock is the most under represented I’ve seen so far but I’d recommend doing what you enjoy the most. Maybe look up the story around the class or play them all for a few levels and see what you get a feel for. Most guilds unless they’re super hardcore will probably accept any classes or professions as far as I’ve been able to tell. 
---
Side note but as far as I’ve been able to tell so far there are “social guilds” who will take almost anyone who seems nice and raid in a much more relaxed and casual way when people eventually make it to level 60. As a fellow noob that’s what I’m hoping to find anyways.
---
These are the BFA people who are used to that.
---
For the majority of your leveling time, gear matters more than spec. Any kind of druid can heal with enough mana up to level 40 with zero problem, maybe even a bit higher with the right gear. But if you're deciding between two different resto builds, you'll have all the important healing talents by then anyway.
---
Keep in mind that this guild exploited layering bugs to generate mobs over and over to grind out rep.  This is clearly not the intention behind layering.
---
Just like the world's first 60, both were done with layer exploits, and in my opinion, both should be banned.
---
Yea I have a couple hundred gold worth of mats and about 150 raw gold, golds scarce but not 1200$/100 scarce
---
Absolutely no point in not putting up SW:P
---
And starting with Mind Blast into swp will hardly cost you any mana that you will easily recover while wanding
---
it will, the strats are know and they will have the stuff by then.
---
Server I played on in vanilla called deadmines DM and Dire Maul DiM. Never heard VC.
---
Lololol Warlock really have problem with tagging :D you have to start with immolate always first in your rotation to have any chance,at least you wont spend that much mana if its stolen.
---
Oh and send your imp to tag everything while you are fighting
---
I think this is a very small group of very dedicated hardcore players who "play" in their own universe. Let them do it and let us play in our own reality.
---
Yeah with world/server first rag/ony you know so far in advance you have won that you don't really have any hype for it. I personally got a serverfirst rag/ony on a pserver and we weren't that excited because Apes were nowhere close.
---
lol, ok swifty shill, you see the way he repeatedly says it over and over? I posted this to the two most relevant subs because it was so obvious. Guess people from the site are downvoting to hide the extremely obvious fact that hes being payed
---
I know one of the apes members because he joined our guild in a different game. Can confirm your comment is true from what he told us about them.
---
This all the way.
---
We share the same feeling mate. I mean congratultions to them, but they don't seem to feel excited at all so I don't think they even care that they are world first.
---
I am level 20 and seem to have way more fun than they had somehow.
---
ah yes, sitting at a named mob spawn for 2 1/2 hours desperately trying to get a tag makes me feel accomplished too.
---
oh wait not because thats not a fucking accomplishment its just pure luck. bro you're drowning in kool-aid, stop. its fucking fanboyness to the highest degree
---
It just breaks the illusion a bit. However, anyone familiar with the private server circuit knew there would be a very early Rag kill. Just didn't think it would be *five* days in. I predicted day 7.
---
Sounds like a good plan.
---
I’m looking to get my main up to 60 and then helping my friends if they need it when questing. PvP servers can be tricky
---
Can’t you learn all 3 secondary professions? I think I have first aid, fishing and cooking on my warrior. I’d highly recommend putting focus on first aid though because you don’t have a heal and I’ve found it a godsend with my warrior.
---
Gehennas, Golemag, Mograine, Firemaw, Shazzarah all have 10k+ queues at peak and even some off peak.
---
Hunter part made me lol
---
I hope no players are from spain
---
A warrior to me feels like a true challenge with great reward. Shit is hard but getting a new gear drop feels incredible. Does priest have any similar dopamine rush or is it a bit smoother?
---
So, can someone explain to me why the people have to keep coming to our forums/reddit groups and shitting on our fun? (That’s sarcasm; I don’t need an explanation).  Telling us all about how wrong we are, how we aren’t having fun, how the game isn’t really fun and we’re all deluding ourselves.
---
If you’re on about classic, Start human, group up for quests that aren’t straight forwards and go on a realm marked “normal”. These are PvE realms.
---
Protect the White!!!
---
Yeah I expect with wiping, but I’m getting sick of priest fearing mobs that end up pulling 4-5 extra elites...
---
I got to 27 as of last night. I feel like i’m really slow in comparison to many... don’t know how people manage to get so far ahead
---
Holy shit man I thought apes was the biggest meme everyone was saying how nobody played private servers that's the only reason apes got good. Wrong they are literal gaming gods.
---
Probably why there is a lot more to the game than end game raiding.
---
They wouldn't have been practising for 15 years straight lol. Secondly, all peopleR used to talk about how wow has got so much harder over the years. Method aren't a little bit behind, they are days and days behind. This is meant to be a professional gaming organisation and they have been embarrassed. 
---
Everyone was saying how much easier classic is, yet the best retail players are days behind in progress. 
---
Remember Method have spent years playing insanely hard retail content, and there are now so many videos available to watch content and how to do bosses. We will give method a break on this one since they couldn't figure out a way to level fast, but if they aren't completely destroying other guilds in BWL then I think people need to be ready to eat their words about how much better retail players are then people used to be.
---
????? what a fucking random-ass unfounded comment. /r/classicwow sucks ass sometimes
---
To be fair MC was super easy even back in the day. It was usually just 25 people tagging along with 15 people actually doing all the heavy lifting.
---
Ha did this like 10 years ago...
---
Thank you guys. I try to hop on another zone
---
not hating, but why is classic not vanilla? what did I miss? did they change stuff apart from layering etc?
---
Point proven
---
i remember it being integrated into the armoury
---
only issue is they don't have all the new races and my demonhunter is missing her tattoos and i cannot put any weapons on it
---

I think Method as an organization was banking on Progress being the WF guild not APES.  They had Kennymarsh there and were going to stream POVs of Progress guys in MC once it started.  Unfortunately their final push in BRD strat failed and some people rage quit slash went to sleep so they gave up.  Even Monkeynews of APES said they thought Progress would be first and only went for it when they realized Progress blew it.
---
Sco said on stream they talked to APES and wanted some of them there too but they wouldn’t come.
---
It was definitely not supposed to be Method the retail guild being WF on stream.
---
Consider my dreams crushed &gt;:(
---
Gets worlds first within a week of the launch:
---
nice...
---
like come thats incredible. just levelling that fast is insane.
---
Please God no
---
Thats sarcasm 100% lol. 
---
Scrype (method raidleader) does he even play classic? Does not look like it
---
Bite is technically slightly more damage per energy, but because it has a cooldown it's not enough so you need claw.
---
I wouldn't recommend bite, it's too much effort to keep up a high rank, just get a new version of claw every 10-15 levels and you are good.
---
You will find people saying the same about leveling in classic.
---
Was it possible to loot on multiple layers?
---
This. Most guilds will end up taking anyone they can.
---
Didnt say the "bald lol" phrases are original. And go back to to retail gets spammed to everyone complaining about classic or simply not being an oldschool player.
---
And here I am ilvl 15..
---
I will not be able to put in a lot of time due to work, so I'd like to get the most out of the time I put in. I only played briefly during Warlords of Dreanor and there I had to wait a lot in queues. 
---
So what should I play?
---
I really don’t know why you get downvoted like that, people may not agree with you, but it’s not like you offended anyone 😅
---
Incredible how many people you baited.
---
MEHPHISTO! Me and kandi are so proud of you!
---
Same as MokeAndSmirrors, i'd like to understand what feels like a bad idea.
---
Even if i can easily think about downsides, like putting number on peoples head, getting out of immersion, ... i think one of the best point would be that even casuals could know people on their servers as "the good guy", or "the guy to avoid".
---
Lol no warrior doesn’t get prio on levelling mail from SM. Sure the mail from wailing caverns or rfk but definitely not armoury. That equipment is good for enhancement shamans and you are free to roll regardless of what spec you turned up in. No one expects a hybrid to be resto or holy during their levelling up. You can maintain this mindset all the way to BRD, at this time, pre raid bis starts dropping and is spec prio, but even then, everyone will roll on stuff because it’s bis on plenty of spreadsheets.
---
It is complicated, that’s the beauty of WoW. You can play PvP or PvE but both are very fun. Best chance is to find a server and a guild to play with early. I personally think Hunter is the best/easiest to play, but I’ve been playing for a long time so you might not think that. If you need friends to play with, feel free to join Rattlegore and join the guild I’m in, it’s not mine but it’s got 200-300 people, somewhere in there. But Rattlegore is a PvP server, and ever server has big guilds... the trick is to find a relatively big one that has cool people in it. Good luck if you start up! My buddy just started for the first time and he is obsessed with it.
---
Hey all noob here, 
---
So I’m playing as horde in EU nether something raceway? My memory of the realm name is fuzzy but anyways. Where is a good place to look for a casual social guild that will raid and PvP casually just all for fun? I’m having a blast but I’d love to find others to play with and to have teach me about the game if they’re willing since im not the best player atm. 
---
What level would you recommend doing wailing caverns? 
---
What level would one recommend I finish questing in the barrens? I’m gonna probably hit level 20 today and thought that maybe should be when? Where do I go after?
---
yeah no sorry this sub sucks enough as is and you want people to witchhunt. stop kid.
---
Theres something in the stormwind drinking water.
---
Deadmines.  Ember stone staff.  It's quite easy to get there.
---
Thanks for your opinion. I’m an adult and i *should* be doing what i want, not socialising or learning new skills...
---
holy fuck lol. this guy and 80% of this subreddit blown the absolute fuck out and I love it. Hide your head in shame if you shared this guy’s opinion even slightly.

No. The game used to be very dark. They intentionally lightened it. There was a big reaction to it when it happened. Places like Duskwood were awesome back then at night. The ambiance was super creepy with the light given off my the street lamps etc. There was actually a torch that you could get. I remember equipping it at night and it would light up an area around your character. There were other lamps in the game files. So Blizzard was probably going to do more with darkness as a mechanic. To be true to vanilla though,they would have to make the night much darker than it is now. Currently, there isn't much difference between night any day, as far as visibility. During vanilla, when it was night, it was DARK. It was very noticeable.  [https://youtu.be/34aokyVkBi8](https://youtu.be/34aokyVkBi8)
---
If you are trying to say that the guilds that couldn't down vanilla Ragnaros would down mythic Azshara... I don't even know what you're smoking.
---
Heads up, Method were never going for world first here.
---
You are happy after gym because physical exercise causes you to release dopamine into your system.
---
It's the same for me. Hard to get up and go to gym but I'm happy that I did. Now I'm even more determined because it let's me keep wow addiction in check :)
---
lol, similar thing happened to me. Was waiting for an npc to spawn next to a sunken ship in darkshore and got stuck in the flat sail at full breath and slowly drowned :(
---
What exactly is the point of having a tank, wouldnt it make it way more effective to just bring another AOE class? Or do they need the tank for bosses?
---
You should stop being afraid of some small quality of life improvements. They're not game-breaking.
---
Yeah the queue starts from like 1
---
That, or an accord needs to be reached between major chunks of top tier players where instead of rushing the event they just prep for what they'll do once it draws to a close.
---
If multiple people get the scepter chain done, more people can reap the rewards.

Benediction. Alliance. Come join our guild. We will gladly take in ANY person who wants to play and enjoy the game, not sit in queues for hours cause people wanna use afk bots.

Look up the guild &lt;Darnassus Fire Dept&gt; on Benediction, Alliance. Whisper someone and say DrTerrible sent you.
---
Again this is a PSA to anyone waiting in queue. Come join us. We want more people to enjoy a game we all love together and have fun.
---
What server was this on?
---
Go back to retail kiddo
---
also have that :D
---
One thing that I've not seen mentioned in the responses is you have to remember that there is deep layering in effect right now.
---
I've done a few tests just to see how layering effects things and found that auctions and guild chat are NOT layered.
---
HOWEVER, general chat and localdefense are both layered. (Obviously, as is /say /yell etc)
---
Another thought to bear in mind is that right now is the "frenzy" period of the release. Within a month, things will slow down dramatically and people will take things a lot slower.
---
Two cats overtaking the world sounds cool. Then one cat with one big fat plate guy.   
---
But I love paladin but hate human. If you can stand dwarf. Dwarf with one cat or bear as pet. Doesn't sound bad.
---
Less people that want them too though.
---
*knitting
---
One of the best feelings for me, that simply doesn't exist in modern wow thanks to flying, is the following:
---
You're standing in Teldrassil, then you realise you need to get to Deadmines in the 17-20 range. 
---
Then you realise how far away that is. Then you realise how far away, physically, that Eastern Plaguelands, Desolace, Silithus, Tanaris and so on are.
---
Then you add on how long it is going to take you to level there. How much more powerful you are going to be. The fact that you'll have a helmet and a pair of shoulders and some rings. The fact that you'll have a mount if you save.
---
Thats just not a feeling that exists in modern wow. The closest they've came recently is starting at lvl 1 and knowing you are aiming for the mage tower legion artifact appearence. Thats the first and last time i've felt that in retail in a long, long time.
---
Those feelings stopped being common in 5.0 onwards i'd say.
---
its allrdy leaked \^\^
---
&gt; First week
---
&gt; First pull
---
&gt; One shot every boss
---
&gt; Half the raid not even 60
---
I’d still put in bank incase
---
ty!
---
Why can't we kill the undead by casting heals on them? It worked for Final Fantasy 7, so it should work for WoW
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailUgliestFloofTTours as i thought very possible
---
Hey guess what if you wanted that kind of experience you could have had it for the past 4 years...
---
Finally retail babies are leaving my queue
---
Are you a night elf hunter or another race trying to level there, because the class quests are only given by your starter zone.
---
Touché. I'm sure it's a topic they'll debate internally.
---
Hi all! Im looking to start a second character in my PvE realm and making it Horde, but have no idea what to do since I've never played as them. I main a mage right now and want to try something a bit different, but haaate Warrior with a passion. My main goals are exploration and soloing things, any suggestions?
---
Both
---
Wotlk naxx must have been the easiest raid ever.
---
Wotlk was still an awesome expansion though.
---
This is 1.12, the true classic MC experience would be 1.0 or 1.2 at most. We won't get that though, you can never get the classic experience back again. We can't suddenly get worse computers and connections. We can't destabilize the servers so they crash as soon as 3 guilds decide to raid MC at the same time. 1.12 is quite different than early WoW, you figure every 3-4 months they revamped a class or 2. 
---
I'm not saying that classic was mechanically insanely hard, just that 1.12 makes the raids far easier than they were when they released. I mean the debuff limit alone is a HUGE boost.
---
Depends on class.
---
A warrior &amp; priest are better off in a duo but a Hunter or Warlock will be a lot better off solo. 
---
Mages are super strong solo too.
---
Its probably different people who want different things with the game.
---
Communities are weird like that.
---
You're so right. It was all dial-up sadness back then. Maybe DSL if lucky haha I had forgotten how many times people DC'd during dungeons and we sit around waiting to see if they would come back. Don't think people today would have sat there waiting like we did back then.. they'd prob just get kicked. How the times have changed.
---
Come to dreadmist alliance :) hit me up there if u want. Name is Goony
---
The best part about it is that MAYBE 10% of the people spamming dungeons actually understand how to do it efficiently.  
---
The rest are utterly clueless and are actually leveling slower than if they just quested
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailUgliestFloofTTours super possible
---
You mean a circle that shows quests areas? If so, then I don't think so. But it does show where on the map you can find mobs for specific quests for example.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailUgliestFloofTTours Doable for sure
---
This content was easy as fuck 15 years ago. There's literally nothing impressive about this other than how much adderall they must've ate to stay awake for a week lol
---
Level 20 for WC is good. 
---
Barrens are huge and in southern barrens you still have quests until around 24-26 iirc.
---
Stonetalon mountains, ashenvale are good options. Hillsbrad foothills maybe also.
---
They'll forget their 300th Rag kill. Your friend won't forget that (and you won't let him).
---
Thanks, especially the vendor delay is annoying
---
I'd like to know too
---
I think take select raids from all expansions and re-create them in classic design mindset adding side-grades \ different tiers \ and additional cool \ interesting items and mounts. No reason not to add 10 man raids like Kara that you can go to in-between UBRS and MC\Ony.
---
I don’t get why more people aren’t talking about this. This shows how easy the content is and how fast people will get bored of classic
---
As a warrior tank I can tell you that DPS are *really* testing my patience lately, and I'm pretty tolerant. Do stupid shit or mistakes, I don't care. Make my job harder, I'll get a little annoyed.
---
As paladin
---
I made same switch. Know horde way too well, have played until 60 at Classic wow. But never as alliance. So did choose Dwarf Paladin and found the dutch guild. I had to leave my old guild that i somewhere found. Bit sad but no regrets.   
---
Go ahead. You will find any good guild anyway. Just meet friends on the way and see if you can join theirs guild.
---
The only thing I could get behind as a change would be dual spec because I am priest. I love healing but also shadow
---
The best are obviously always the ones that get endorsement deals.
---
Much like the best musicians are always those that get a lot of money. 
---
Simple science.
---
Jcb
---
Benediction maybe?
---
Saw a nice influx of people over the weekend join our lovely server! I love it here! So many nice people. Herod was full of pricks. Then they chased that gangland guild off the server and the assholes came here. Ugh.
---
If I want to be able to play on another computer, but have all my settings/add-ons carry over, can I just copy the Interface/add-ons folder? Do I need the WTF folder as well? Anything else?
---
My experience with the community has been kind of disappointing. All I ever see is Maga this liberal that, build the wall. I wish the people would find better ways to spend their time instead of trying to be jerks.
---
There is a big difference in skill required between retail heroic raid and any classic raid. Retail heroic is pugged regularly, so there is no reason classic will not be just as easy to pug.
---
I got [Cat Carrier (Siamese)](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8490/cat-carrier-siamese) on my first Cookie kill AMA
---
&gt;"I want everyone to be envious of me when I get my tier set, wahhh."
---
so transmog you tier set then
---
Doesn’t work in classic it’s a Pserver thing
---
after looking into it. People are saying this DOES work and can increase wand speed. but also as a priest my woolen bags are always full and im not sure id recommend this.
---
"people aren't playing how I want them to play, please make changes to the game so they play more like how I want them to"

This was tweeted out almost a week before release that Method as a guild is not participating.

\*recent translations\*
---
MY SIDES
---
You need to actually go into your Q log, select the quest and hit the ‘Abandon’ button to abandon the quest.
---
I agree, im not against changes :)
---
I was banned for 3 says for doing this on retail, which would be using the modern tos. I wasn’t even saying anything offensive just “u lose” and was banned for “cross faction scripting”
---
There was plenty of user made ui"s in the game in 2006 so what you talking about?
---
The counterpoints are non factual, "everyone used to click" or "people played at 15fps" - this is all untrue. You think I have ego when an entire generation of wow players for some reason think people are significantly better at computer games than 12 years ago - it's pure bs lol, especially when the worlds best retail guild right now is not even competitive in progress. 
---
The general trend of computer games has been they have become *more* accessible (easy), not less, this was an ongoing complain since tbc especially concerning arena weapons. People were annoyed that players were able to pick up 2-3 pieces of gear for 3 hours work per week that was on par with gear that took dozens of hours of investment raiding to get.  People that now raid in retail wouldn't even be max level in classic.
---
Pretty much this. /thread
---
Feels
---
I don't get why I have to pay for the skills and food tho, I'm a recruit and they should be feeding and clothing me, but instead I just do and pay for everything by myself and they dare to charge me for my help? Worst business opportunity ever.
---
Another issue is not being able to hit shit while spamming sunder, hit rating is abysmal early on. Also taunt can miss and people aren't used to that.
---
%t gives the name of the person selected.
---
Is there any way (or addon) to change the chat to look like this?
---
* Default: `[1. General - Teldrassil] [Tirafesi]: This is a general message.`
---
* What I want: `[Tirafesi]: This is a general message.`
---
Or something along these lines. It's just that the stupid tags take way too much chat space.
---
I probably don’t have that experience as am on an OCE server. So it’s just jokes about your mum or getting on the piss.
---
I’m on TenStorms EU. Join me! Haha nah just kidding, just unsub?
---
Not the person you replied to but I would say phasing, in your face story driven gameplay, overused vehicle mechanics, and achievements beginning the collector mentality are all things that stood out to me as marking a change from tbc.  It just made the game feel more saccharine and fake imo. But the game was yet to be totally ruined pre-lfg so it feels like sort of a middle ground between the game everyone loved and the game we grew to hate.
---
Exactly, so lets encourage Blizzard to fix the AH since we all agree its horrible and you need addons to make it bareable.
---
The fuck you on about, never had that issue in over 150h, and zones are chock full of gathering nodes(for all professions,but you can pick everything) and there are always spawns of mobs since the spawn timers especially for some are quite low, so either you were specifically trying to down the small WBs which are usually camped or idk when you played but even starting zones dont have that issue.
---
So you're poor now?
---
Private servers were better. There I said it. The PVE was more balanced for 1.12 talents and modern knowledge.
---
Classic wow contains all of the player buffs and all of the enemy nerfs that occured through all of vanilla's history. It's exactly what I would have expected from Blizzard.
---
Right? Although I've had to abandon my combat talents progression for the time being to go straight to improved SnD in the assassination tree. I never manage and eviscerate if I want to keep the slicing up
---
What level do you need to be for SM if you want to find a group ?
---
Someone gets it
---
You've got to grind as well as explore other levelling zones. Maybe try the undead area?
---
When your brother randomly decides to throw a party during raid night
---
Just a reminder, don’t bubble warriors or druids unless they’re really low. They don’t gain rage when the bubble takes damage.
---
Why is this a big deal?  This was accomplished back in 2005.
---
I'm triggered by your use of a camera *angled* toward the screen. Just hit print screen dude
---
loaded up twitch the other day, noticed wow had an insane number of people
---
looked at top streamer with 330k viewers.... wtf
---
Thanks man! Also What level is stranglethorn for? I’ve heard it called stranglethorn vietnam and I wish to experience that lol
---
Thundefurries unite! Met a lot of nice people so far.
---
They failed everything.
---
While it's an upgrade to 99% of all classic players I doubt anyone will spend their money on pre-raid bis if they want to get their mount first.
---
“Your friend”
---
Sure, dude
---
 I may be wrong but I think you're mistaken. I believe the cost happened at the same time the normal mount requirement got dropped to level 30 at the end of Burning Crusades
---
Most of the addons people use now in Classic didnt exist in vanilla. And the ones that did exist werent nearly as good as they are today.
---
Also, why does the Classic experience have to include even the horribly bad parts of vanilla that everyone agrees are bad?
---
Folks forget the game was harder then it should at one point because shit was just broken.
---
BECAUSE MY PETS KEEP RUNNING AWAY
---
Right, sorry. It's been 15 years since I last did the quest. The name hasn't stuck with me, but the traumatically low spawn and drop rate has.
---
Interesting you say pushing yourself physically which I normally associate with working out / physical activity. Pushing yourself physically in this context has terrible effect on your body.
---
Yeah copy the wtf folder as well for the settings. That should do it.
---
Lol. Gehennes eu is a nightmare... I've legit waited more than I've played over the last 3 days... 15+hrs of queue with less than 5 hours of play.
---
I'm not even sure but I've need reading the 'hack' for fast leveling is pulling large groups of scarlet mobs to AOE down. Reset and repeat.
---
Google Belle Delphine bath water, it’s a meme at this point
---
Tried eso.
---
Meh. Not very good. 3/10.
---
But pugs will be full of average non raiders, retail normal/hc pugs also actually fail more than they are successful and often just go boss by boss brute forcing it with tons of wipes.
---
That will also happen, there will be MC speed run leaderboards. But APES likely won't be on top since they are alliance.
---
I mean I respect the criticism that flying mounts were a negative impact over a longer time but it didn't ruin world pvp in TBC since world pvp was centralized on locations with objectives, like Nagrand, terokkar or Hellfire. Or it was in flying restricted areas like Quel'danas or azeroth. 
---
&gt; There is also another bunch of issues in TBC, like how it makes old Azeroth more or less obsolete, and how they rework all of old azeroth into a single player game (most elites are turned into non-elites etc) 
---
Except that this didn't happen until much later. And azeroth wasn't obsolete at all. Cata with flying mounts made azeroth obsolete. You can always criticise TBC for not creating an expansion within Kalimdor and EK but no expansion managed to do that other than Cata that tried and failed. 
---
TLDR you didn't respond to most my counter arguments. Even if I'm generous and grant you the point of flying mounts; it's not much. You would still need to argue why Vanilla would be better than TBC. Vanilla being extremely flawed with in its time extremely bad logistics(queue times, server issues, buggy quests), no class balance, raids that were very simple(doesn't compare to tbc at all), pvp system that was just about spamming BGs for a title, world pvp that is glorified today was often just a slaughter cause of faction imbalance. Don't get me wrong I love vanilla but it was very flawed. TBC had better raids, more options to play the game with meaningful rep grinds, better PVP introducing arena, better class balance.
---
As I said earlier, there are plenty of things to criticise TBC for, the strongest arguments you've not manage to make even(the lore). But there are plenty of things to praise TBC for. You spoke like it's some objective truth that TBC is bad; it's not. "***strictly worse game***" get the fuck out of here. Learn to some self awareness when your opinion is strictly motivated by emotion.
---
&gt;expecting a company to have morals 
---
1-800-cmon now
---
ESO pvp was hella fun during beta, and then they nerfed and ruined it like everything else.
---
&gt; Whats good is that we can ignore each other and play our own way, classic lets us both do what we want.
---
Except your experience of the pre-AQ War Effort event, which is supposed to take weeks, is going to be taken away by those hardcore players.
---
Hardcore p-server guilds across all realms are going to start stocking up on the materials necessary to unlock AQ within minutes of reset, skipping most of the War Effort content.
---
This is going to affect *everyone* on the realm. So yeah, that's gonna be a thing.
---
This is the part where you tell me what there is to farm outside of raid gear and an epic mount
---
Wait...you think no one pvpd before honorable kills were implemented? If anything once they implemented honorable kills world pvp took a hit and that first phase of wow had the most fun pvp
---
It's not super impressive that they did it first, but it is impressive how fast they did it.
---
There will be free character migration / transfer off of FULL realms next week 
---
If not, I’ll eat a shoe. Quote me

They’re not using a CRT anymore
---
It’s very different though. Gym is great for your health and makes you feel good about yourself. I personally  love going to the gym and trying  to push those numbers up! 
---
Not sure it’s the same.
---
Got feet of the lynx from first mob i killed in redridge, rip rest of the rng.
---
Gz. Hos many chests do you have to loot to get it? And when do they spawn?
---
It's like being the best at another MMO and thinking that skill transfers over to all MMOs.
---
It doesn't help them that classic raids are mindlessly easy in comparison to more modern raids with no gear check.
---
This is classic world first, not vanilla.
---
Everyone started fresh and this counts as classic world first.
---
Yeah most of us have jobs now since the original launch, we're in our 30s and 40s :P $10 USD is ok to play my favourite game of all time.

---
What's with the hate boner for Method? I honestly think they promoted it saying they're attempting W1st but knew they wouldn't get it because private server players are on another level. But it promoted and hyped up the event, brought in more viewers, advertisements etc.
---
It actually ruins character fantasy. 
---
Sometimes I feel like people don't know what an RPG is. Walking around in beat up rags that you found on boars around the world, but literally looking like the Lich King is extremely bad for immersion.
---
Look for a guild.
---
This is some solid bait, also some solid poo babies in here. Yeet
---
Asgalon was the best fight and also the hardest. On some private servers asgalon is sweaty as fuck. Only a few guilds did it on some of them. If blizz decides to do WotLK i'm going back hard.

Yes but you are saying they are robbing themselves of fun.. your definition of fun, not theirs. They find that they have the most fun when min-max rushing through the game, you find your fun in leveling and taking in all of what Azeroth has to offer.

25 before rerolling here. New toon is 13. Wooo about to head to barrens.
---
Once you are out of the starting zone (in your case Dun Morogh) you'll have to occasionally switch zones to get enough quests to keep up your level without grinding. Darkshore is an excellent alternative for you at this point.
---

---
All I see is someone trying to stay logged on
---
But but classic is so much harder than retail and takes so much skill. It's like dark souls, remember that thread?
---
Anyone who actually played vanilla and wasn't blinded by nastalgia knew that vanilla raid mechanics are a joke by today's standards. You asked for no changes and you kids have been saying how much harder classic is for months.
---
You got what you wanted, deal with it and enjoy the authentic experience.
---
Haha yes lets aoe grind SM for 10 levels then move on to ZF! What immersion! Such authentic classic experience!

I play on an Omen 15 laptop and the poor thing has done daily 14 hour shifts for like a week now lol. Perry sure the fans are about to die. rip
---
Your stream likely sucks because you are a poor host. Stop trying to blame others for that
---
This! Except somebody stole a named mob that I needed for a quest and invited me to the group before it was dead. People aren't all trying to be dicks, sometimes it just happens :)
---
does anyone else find this kinda tragic?  they've done this like 20 times before, what is the actual point now
---
That's why I still think guild wars 2 is one of the best leveling experiences. The moment you enter a zone, everyone gets the same exp and killing world bosses needs more people to kill them so a lot of people meet on the maps to kill them. Wow should really have dynamic events where one player's action can spawn other events. Like, bandits are poisoning the water of a village and if no one helps, the villagers die. If they help, the bandits get angry and attack the other village. I loved this concept in guild wars 2
---
Ha! I'm already the boss so I can take (gaming) breaks 😉
---
This just shows how OP stacking Frost Mages and Fury Warriors is.
---
I wish these guys didn't no life this solely for the reason that it has a negative impact to the game from people who don't understand why this was done so fast this time around, compared to actual vanilla.
---
Nobody who actually played back then gives a fuck because this was expected. People who didn't play back then just shit on vanilla even more. 
---
This isn't really positive for anyone. Oh right, it is for those guys who probably made some money out of the event.
---
I swapped from Gole, to Gehennas, to Firemaw, to Mograine as well. From the point of release I was on the newest server there was. I then played all night and the next day because there was no other option. Now everyone says it's my fault for not rerolling a character I'd played for hours and hours already. It's blizzards fault and not the players. People who rolled on Mog had no other choice at the point that they started playing.
---
Yeah I think they're kicking people who are afk by the thousands manually and seeing if they log back in.
---
I was afk for 13 mins today and got dc'd.
---
Just worry about how you play the game and not others. The people running dungeons all day arnt on here complaining about how you're leveling.
---
All you can really do as a Tank is MT the bosses in AV LUL
---
Got in a GY run yesterday that turned out to be a "farm run" with heavy AoE cleave without a proper tank, and we used Eye of Kil'rog to pull packs. Worked maybe 50% of the time and it was fucking miserable. Like, if you wanna level like that then power to you brother, but that tryharding life ain't for me dog.
---
I'm looking for some certain addons
---
1- Show enemy HP as a number or at least a percentage
---
2 - show my XP without having to mouse over it
---
3 - show stuff on minimap like profession trainers, mailboxes, auction house, etc
---
4 - tidyplates or similar, has it been fixed for classic 
---
5 - bartender or similar, same question as above
---
Well sure, but to me classic seems more like a nostalgia thing. I don't expect classic to be the main game, my hope is that the next expansion to wow 1 will bring in stuff from classic and become a good game again, so we can keep classic as a sort of museum exhibition where you can go and check out what the game used to look lile.
---
So you'd rather have everyone just looking the same? Because that's what happens with no transmog.
---
Gehenas EU
---
With the current meta of Mage cleave grinding mobs, good luck building enough threat on 20 mobs.
---
Facetious? 
---
Chill mate. Either you dont fully grasp the meaning of being facetious or you just need to relax, a whole lot.
---
&gt;So I currently play a Pally and was curious if I could make a macro for my Seals. That if I accidentally cast the same Seal it wont recast? 
---
It's possible to make a macro like this using scripts, look into AuraUtils, but whether that macro would work in combat is another question entirely. Blizzard tends to block any API calls that would let a macro make move the skill floor up, though I haven't tested this one myself.
---
Hahahhaaha. 
---
Congrats on your new level! Rent's due!
---
If that dude that's taking a shot was wearing a polo, he would have completed his journey to 100% bro.
---
Int is the area buff I get. I see tons of mages and buff then Wisdom or MotW depending who I'm playing on and a rarely ever get Int back. Priest, Pallys, and Druids throw out buffs like crazy.
---
\*pops stealth and waits for you to pull\*

The spanish are on the us servers.

I've got that same exact keyboard!
---
Who said I was angry? I'm just commenting on the obvious
---
Classic wow atracted tons of new players in the last few days and  i havent a seen a single post where new player woulld be dissapointed in the game. Trust me theres a reason why a 15 years old game put other mmos to shame right now:). Plus, if you somehow end up on server Herod (Horde) feel free to pm me! 
---
Classic wow doesnt have any game shops or some shady microtransactions going on. You pay 15$ a month and you get the entire game. You know what other mmo can provide that? Exactly, none ^_^. So stop wasting your time and get yourself a god damn subscribtion already:)
---
MMOs are almost always ruined by it's playerbase. They brainlessly Zerg the content and then bitch and moan about a lack of content.
---
Even a game like hearthstone. People who don't even enjoy the game play it most. They just want to grind as quickly as possible for STUFF and not even attempt to enjoy the game.
---
You could argue that everyone enjoys the games differently. I think this is a lie. The people who blast through the game don't enjoy it. They want to feel special. It they have addictive personalities.
---
Oh well. I'm going slow and loving it!!
---
And it's totally ok dude
---
Actually no, now that it's been optimized dungeon leveling is way faster. They just started really optimizing in SM cath when they were way behind.
---
Trinkets like gnomish battle chicken give a 5% haste buff for 5 minutes. It can be used, chicken casts squawk, remove trinket and put real one on.
---
Arcanite dragonling also has some fire damage buff.
---
Grenades I don’t think are on potion CDS and are one of the few AoE interrupts.
---
Hunters can FD and jumper cable to battle red.
---
Rogues can do the same with vanish. It’s finicky because of pulsing combat but possible.
---
Then many of the items are just fun. There is a reflector for every school of magic trinket, Death Ray can crit people for like 4K. Maybe more.
---
I've never had this problem. Everyone always waited until everyone got it done.
---
Or just let the guy enjoy what they enjoy? I dont think its a question of which version is ultimately better, but rather which playstyle suits the individual.
---
I really like aimlessly immersing myself in the world and exploring and am in no rush to level so I personally really enjoy classic. However, my boyfriend prefers retail because he likes the faster pace of it all.
---
Alot of your issues have been alleviated in retail. I suggest you chop over and give retail a shot.
---
that post didnt age well :D
---
Yes, but for aoe dungeon farming it makes it way faster so results in a net increase of exp/hour
---
I see some confusion, the joke is that I need to walk slowly behind my friends and therefor my feet get tired.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND

Around 45% of Caucasian men experience hairloss before the age of 30. That is not a few 🙂.

People say his brother played his account. I don’t understand why he couldn’t do a webcam or at least a keyboard cam so that people wouldn’t question is someone else was playing his mage.

WoW classic is not about what these freaking racers are doing. Nbf they are kind of ruining it for other people, though that happens in every single game you play these days. WoW classic is about the community. Yesterday, me and my friend we were starting at a boss sourended by loads of harpies, and thinking how we can do this shit. Then 2 other people came, we asked to join forces, obvs they had to if they wanted to do this quest to. This was super fun. We just have to ignore the racers and all this crap. And ya bet the fokin molten core will be hard, just ya watch my pet pull all the mobs round the corner!
---
That's better! Issue with a WoW 2 is the amount of time people pour into a character / account on WoW.
---
I have seen people call blizzard money grabbing for classic etc but if you have an active account you get the game basically for free and there is no pay to win in it so they have done it the right way
---
That's from auctioneer IIRC and I believe its called SlideBar.
---
Yep. For sure did that back in the day.
---
Welcome to Classic :).
---
Sorry for the rant, but I’m going to rant idgaf lol. 
---
I still don’t understand the hype. Played Vanilla and TBC well scripted private servers with 1000s of people at a time with no lag. Why are people falling for this marketing scheme? 
---
I know it doesn’t cost extra, but it’s got people rebooting their subs because their current product (BFA) is trash. How does that make any sense? They make a garbage product and then get people to come back to play something they released 15 years ago which has been readily available to play for free for a few years now? This is why so many “AAA” companies just don’t give a shit. Because their consumers will lap up any sewage they spill.
---
U need first aid more than cooking
---
Where is this dessert you speak of that we can run around in?
---
Welcome to classic I think you mean. Retail is still cancerous
---
They were all plus or minus five percent of each other, what with subtlety's HAT builds amd so forth. This was when survival hunters got some bullshit that made them viable dps.
---
There became no bad choices, and so no good choices either. Same with gear; everything got homogenised to the point where you'd look at two items and they'd be indistinguishable from each other, so you just went with the higher item level one. Which gave rise to gearscore, more bullshit that told you nothing about a player other than their average item level.
---
In classic, you can inspect someone and see the gear choices they've made, and know whether they've made good choices or not. For that to be possible, it needs to be possible to make bad choices.
---
go play retail?
---
Lol and people thought private server players wouldnt steamroll this
---
I'm pretty sure if method actually wanted to win they would have just hired the pserver guys to join their main team and form the ultimate 40man...
---
RemindMe! 6 months
---
didn't they get ony as well
---
I’m so glad to have been a part of this after he fact
---
What happend in p2?
---
Great! Sounds good
---
As far as pedantism about terminology goes, it was named AoE back in Warcraft III. Not to mention the Pit Lord neutral hero was added in a later patch.
---
Give it a try and see for yourself! But yes its worth its ptice for sure!
---
Years of doing it on private servers
---
This is incorrect. Holy Spells are partially resisting which is completely unrelated to the spell hit mechanic. Holy spells are treated the same way as any other spell school, which means level based resistances exists for them.
---
There's just no way for players to interact with this resistance through spell penetration or resist gear, so there's no need for a UI element displaying the holy resistance ingame.
---
Id recommend shaman. they are a lot of fun, quite strong and handle mobs easily, you can get into a dungeon group as a healer or dps quite easily, and the best part is you get ghost wolf, which is really fast in a slow world.
---
Well, I mean, what did everyone expect?
---
5 for me. Only had about an hour to play
---
If you've never played Horde I recommend Shaman.  They're a versatile class that can do a bit of everything if spec'd right.  They also have some weird and flavorful utility spells (water walking/breathing, farsight, ghost wolf).  Their totems make their playstyle very unique and fun.  I love being able to salvage crazy situations by pulling out just the right combinations of totems while balancing my damage and healing.
---
Blood and thunder!
---
Is this loss?
---
Cool, so, now what?
---
Tbh, blizzard will never invest the time and work to fix ah at this point even if whole community agrees with it. So just go download an addon
---
Most people go with the normal combat build.. Which is nice. 
---
I went with full dagger sub spec holyshit. Hitting that 400 dmg crit 1 hotting players and mobs in early 20s is amazing. Don't care I dont lvl as fasr
---
You're gonna have to hold onto that a while til you can get its proper value
---
looking at the kills, I feel like I was too quick to judge retri, feral and spriest as nin existant raid soecs. at lvl60 with dungeon blues they should be ok :)
---
5day time investment guys
---
Hey, even Warcraft 3 had that mechanic in play. Holy Light would damage undead.
---
They are farming dungeons with 10 people instead of 5 so they effectively do double the damage and get the same amount of XP.
---
Can you link even one post saying that APES can't compete with Method
---
Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.
---
That's not dizzy the Apex player is it?
---
Well yea we know that now!
---
I suppose the true challenge now is getting 40 or so folk together at the same time. But still theres no reason not to pot aside from money saving,  WF race is Over but now its time for us Scrubs to Clear and Farm Loot for Phase 2. and consumables will help speedrun these long trials.
---
And i always say a new classic+ experience should fix this whole thing.
---
Thanks! I had no memory of this being a thing. That solves that then!
---
everyone has been super nice and I have been enjoying my time. Except only once.. I literally had a guy on Pagel join our group, ask if I ever played vanilla wow, and promptly leave when I said it was my first time non-retail. then he chatted in general chat how he would pay more to play on a server  with people who only played vanilla before as a prerequisite. this was also when we were just questing silverdine. I couldn't believe it.
---
What i mean is that someone in T1 or T2 or T3 or T0.5 isn't gonna look the same, so why would everyone look the same? Yes if someone has T3 they're gonna look the same as someone else with T3 but i don't see a problem with that. Also this only really matters at lvl 60. So for 90% of the game nobody looks the same.
---
I prefer that over having some lvl 40 run by me looking completely ridiculous in his little made up outfit.
---
Higher ranks have higher charges.
---
Abilities like sinister strike can proc poisons so they cause the higher usage on mainhand/offhand
---
I dont participate in trivial content
---
I would mind it very much.
---
What is this robes of Arugal circlejerk? I’ve ran SFK twice and both times someone tried to claim the robe drop before the run.- “hey this is my sixth run and I haven’t gotten robes so nobody need on it if it drops”. Why the hell are people so obsessed with it? They’re good but nothing to stunt leveling progress over.
---
Yeah, I get that it's just my vanilla brain speaking, haven't played for 5+ years but played from release for about 7 years or so.
---
Still great achievement and I guess it would be hard to credit the guys from over a decade ago for figuring out the mechanics and strategy and grinding hundreds of hours of wipes over weeks xd
---
They've been doing this for years on private servers
---
If youve ever watched any 10 man farm groups, their exp/hour is almost always garbage teir.
---
If you like PvP, shaman is the way to go. With the slow travel time of lightning bolt, you can cast chain lighting and follow it with an earth shock, a three hit the enemy at the same time and one shot a lot of players. I know you don't want to heal but sometimes it's nice to have the option
---
I realised the same yesterday, lvl 20 warrior. Spent about 1,5-2h to train up both cooking and fishing using these as guides:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fishing-classic-wow-1-300
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/cooking-classic-wow-1-300
---
Fishing is kinda boring but very useful for cooking once you get the recipes.
---
Nice. Good to know.
---
reality is that guilds like apes have played vanilla +5years on private servers and thats why they are good. average gamer today however is as dumb as ever, probably even worse when it comes to actually solving problems etc if it wasnt for utube guides.
---
I still don't get why people think vanilla is harder. Thinks being health sponges and hitting for more damage doesn't equate to a harder game. Instead it makes for a slower paced game. It doesn't help that there is so much bad game design in Vanilla. Things like enemies aggroing each other when the initial enemy was on a second floor somewhere, horrible spawn timers that just waste players time and don't really accomplish anything else, bad drop rates for quests also do the same thing. Vanilla/Classic did a lot of things right even to this day but the stuff that sucks REALLY sucks.
---
It is a game with mechanics that are 15 years old . A toddler could deal with these raids .
---
Just had a hunter pet kill us all in gnomer 2 pulls before therma. Pulled the entire middle track
---
Played a mage for years and years, know the class inside out (since late TBC/early WotLK)
---
However, drinking after every pull is getting tiresome. I'm at 28 now, and whilst its far better than the earlier levels it's getting on my nerves
---
* Is mana a huge issue at later levels/PvP
---
* Does any other class have as much capability for a 2v1 as a mage? 
---
I'm mostly a PvP player and have been leaning towards a rogue, but I think mage has far more favourable match ups in general
---
Thoughts?
---
What does lulw mean?
---
Let me guess, pserver vets are applying this tactic in tandem with the new mage AoE speedleveling meta? I don't think the bleeding edge of hardcore players' playstyle should concern you too much provided that you manage to find a group that plays in a way you find comforting
---
My brother's best friend is like 24 and almost completely bald now. Poor guy, feel really sorry for him. But he embraces it and just buzzes it.
---

---
Honor system, hence the joke
---
Imagine not browsing reddit exclusively on your phone in 2019.
---
Retail is very detailed and pretty at times but it's all so compact and compressed it never genuinely feels like wilderness, I never feel immersed. Also a forest feels a lot bigger when you're on your own and in danger compared to when you're running on your giant corehound 100% mount basically immortal to anything in the forest.
---
Mob grinding quests are pretty much never a bad thing. They may feel frustrating, but if every single mob grinding quest was done in the minimal amount of kills needed you'd find yourself lagging behind in levels and forced to run all over the place to find quests even more.
---
The key is just to make sure you're spending your time usefully. Don't just run around trying to cherry pick that one mob you need. Kill everything in the area while waiting for respawns. It's best in terms of maximising xp gain and will likely speed up completion of the quest as well, as many mobs share a spawn pool (you can usually tell by the behaviour/type of the mob as to whether they share a spawn pool or not).
---
Best example is how I saw people complaining about how there were so few fire elements for the Stonetalon Mountains quest, with people citing 1.5h+ quest times. I just killed mobs in the area and completed it in less than 20 minutes.
---
Shaman isn’t that RNG based in pvp as elemental is the superior spec. 
---
But from what you write as pros/cons it sounds like hunter would fit you. Hunter dmg falls off in later tiers but early tiers you can do really good damage especially since your tier pieces are actually good and you don’t compete for gear that much.  I always recommend playing something you think looks cool/enjoy the class fantasy of cause you’ll likely to stick with it!
---
Boomkin deals about 10% of the dps that a warrior does, but if you find a group to carry you, sure, the boss is going down.
---
40 people is large enough that one person could be literally afk and it won't have a gigantic impact on the result of the fight.
---
How do you report a player without right click? The fucking spammers keep sending me channel invites. Only way I could find to report them was to manually whisper them then right click.
---
Simple question Sunday is exactly what I need in my life! 
---
I have two questions at the moment! Context, I have never played WoW before, main game to classic, until I started classic last week. 
---
Question 1) what is a swipe? 
---
I was looking at add ons and saw this comment:
---
&gt; The combination of “Classic Aura Durations” ( shows debuffs time remaining with the “swipe” ) and “OmniCC” ( show numbers on top of "swipe"s) will do that;
---
What does he mean by swipe, with the swipe and on the swipe? 
---
Question 2) does anyone have a link to somewhere that gives you rough respawn times? I waited for this spider queen west of Barron (Besseleth?) for 20 mins and saw nothing and just left... is this normal? 
---
Thanks in advanced!
---
If they roll need, you pass but make sure they equip it.
---
If not, everyone should roll greed.
---
Way over a week for the average person for sure
---
You could, but it would involve a lot of grinding mobs. Quests in Classic are not enough to take you through a zone's entire level range by themselves, that's a TBC and later type deal.
---
There are also a lot of quest chains that take you all over, from zone to zone. Leveling guides usually try to make you do these efficiently, and give you quests to do at all times rather than grinding, which is why they send you around.
---
So, yes, you can do that, if you really want to. But there's a reason the leveling guides tell you to travel to other zones.
---
Sadly, i am not a miner.
---
It's impossible to completly destroy another guild in BWL because it will be cleared in less than an hour after launch.
---
Yeah I’ve been using it exclusively, hopefully we can change everyone’s minds.
---
For me shaman is too much fun in wPvP. Because of the slow travel time of lightning bolt, you can cast another chain lighting and follow it up with an earth shock, all 3 abilities hit the enemy at the same time and can one shot people it's great.
---
If it bothers you that much play something else? I know a lot of the zones like the back of my hand for lvls 1-30 but the experience is different every time because you meet new people and/or you're playing a different class. A lot of us just enjoy what the game is in this version. I'm one of them.
---
I believe there was a busiest server ranking thread on this sub somewhere. I'd probably recommend picking one in the lower half of population density.
---
There are plenty of realms with no queue times whatsoever.
---
I called DOTA an MMO, which is apparently wrong. :p
---
Who would have known that some basic 15 year old tank and spank mechanics would be easy in 2019 .
---
I know for a fact that you can make characters on more than one server.
---
On a private server US people called it VC and dps DD (Damage dealer), i was really confused for a while
---
Why do you blame people for assuming things when you assume a lot by yourself? 
---
I have no intention of continuing this argument and like I said,  I have no interest in finding exact numbers and data. My main point was you shouldn't ignore the experiences other people had, you come out way too aggressive for reasonable discussion.
---
All of these broadband qualities, people using forums to find data - they were different for different people from multiple regions so I don't see how you could possibly prove these wrong based on your knowledge and these general statements?
---
Side note as an example: My area didn't have broadband for every house until WoW was already released for example and this was normal for the region I come from during that time. I waited until broadband before l I started playing wow like 3-4 months after its release because my dial-up was way too expensive and unreliable to play with.
---
If you plan on playing on a high pop server either wait it out or log in early
---
Yay!! Heres to looking out for the fellow lock players!! Cheers!!!
---
Maybe, I generally don't concern myself too much with what the community says, instead I prefer to listen to people who actually has some credentials, most of the ones I saw predicted APES. I wouldn't call someone an underdog if most experts consider them the most likely to win.
---
Thats not true - mythic raiding is accessible for the best players - but there is LFR, Normal, HC. Just because most people can't do the highest skill lvl content doesent mean it should be removed. People just need to stop crying and thinking they are better than they are...
---
So should csgo also remove ranking and people should only be silver? Because then everyone can play together  :()   
---
And yes it is more or less the same - because 95% the same content is avalible to you even if you suck balls. You can do LFR.
---
I’d play as a hunter or warlock as they’re really strong levelers and not very gear dependent if you don’t have time to do dungeons.
---
The queue time on popular NA servers probably longer than the maintenance on OCE servers tbh... I was in queue for 12h day 1, 15h day 2, 6h day 3...
---
At 34 they're a gold.
---
Oh, well that is interesting. Perhaps there's a bit more to this than I know then
---
You missed parry in arms
---
We have imbalanced pvp left, duuuh
---
Phase 1 will be mostly a weekly quick run of MC and stockpiling gold for later stages of the game.
---
Bis for rogue obviously
---
Did we do the same quest?
---
Need - it's an upgrade that you're going to use
---
Greed - it's something you want to sell
---
Haters gonna hate
---
Come to rattlegore, we get full at around 5-8 then theres like an hour or less que but other than that we dont get ques but still a lot of people enough to get ques at certain times
---
how do you kill that which has no life?
---
And many will find out it actually isn’t easy, in the sense that you have to gather 40 people that aren’t idiots, without the aid of anything like LFR. Most people here claiming Classic is easy will be stuck in BWL by the time naxx comes out.
---
I am level 20. At what level can I start questing in the undead area and where? Thank you
---
&gt; It's almost like politics reflect a person's deep beliefs and those beliefs make up who they are as a person
---
That would be the case is everyone actually knew what the fuck they were voting for, some people simply vote for what the louder majority preach because its a common mentality to think the masses must be right, Social Media platforms have cranked this flawed human logic up to 11 thanks to the dopamine addiction of chasing likes (being part of the crowd and thus receiving affirmation) instead of standing up for a currently controversial opinion and risk being disliked (and with it comes the the feeling of being potentially attacked by the sheep/crowd and having to defend yourself or even being isolated). 
---
So actually i would personally deduce that overt displays of politics do not necessarily reflect a person's deep beliefs.
---
What's a build I can play in dungeons / 20 mans but also BGs without changing the spec? I'd prefer a healer for easier party find (H)
---
Anyone familiar with vanilla private servers already knew that rag was gonna die week 1. Still an amazing achievement, the amount of work and planning all this , is unreal. Gz to APES.
---
Priest is at the 11 second mark...
---
They got wrecked hard. What is it "based on" then?
---
If it's so "not hard", why didn't they do better?
---
Dont worry bud, these players will figure it out soon
---
If you're bored then go play something else...you aren't entitled to enjoy something lol.
---
And besides you can't call it world first if you've already killed Rag and Ony back in vanilla..
---
You know what? Let's go over everything.
---
1)No tranq shot for Magmadar, no defensive cooldowns to survive through enrage.
---
2)Garr makes seals and blessings useless.
---
3)Shazzrah silences and wrecks melee.
---
4)Ragnaros' sons manaburn all nearby targets.
---
Told myself when I quit retail that I wasn't gonna come back for classic wow and now I'm kicking myself for not bothering to farm enough gold for a token when I quit. 🙃
---
Just dont
---
It gets much better the higher you get.
---
There's a LOT of retail players coming over with this mentality. Have to group for quest? Invite, don't talk, ignore someone talking to you, leave. If someone's like this I usually just prefer not to play/group with them anyways. A lot of those people will filter out.
---
Aye I'm soloing almost all quests fully specced into hpala in 90%cloth and it's not taking for ever to kill them either. Plus I can take on 2 mobs at once making pulling easier
---
I have a small business (italian style pizzería) and i work nights, usually have time to login around 00:30/1:00 am, and i have to say:
---
No queues for me!
---
I'm horde :/ doing quests in Ashenvale atm to hit 30
---
Honestly not a bad spec but Imo its better to use anger management and 5 points into more threat from attacks instead of 1h dmg, that one is very negligable.
---
Then again you can just tank literally everything as arms or fury, which kills stuff faster and you still won't die or lose aggro.
---
Where did I say I'm bored?
---
Had someone advertise for a LFG saying they were a 'dd' and not a dps..
---
It's bizarre to me really. Just play retail and let the folks who enjoy the old vibe play classic. There's literally 0 reasons the two can't exist harmoniously.
---
I couldn't decide which server should I play on yet. I have a couple of level 4.
---
care to explain why?
---
Ok, I think Ill take away from anticipation then.
---
Thank you for the elaborate answer. I still yearn for an MMORPG to play again. I was too young and couldnt afford to play WoW when it came out so I was always playing the F2P stuff that was available to me and I ended up playing LotRo and GW2 for quite a while.
---
However I was always the idiot from my group of friends that ran around everywhere doing every quest available because I loved running through those worlds, and those worlds were somewhat empty in certain parts of the map those games. 
---
I generally enjoyed the level 20 free trial, but it always felt a little empty, as in it felt like I was alone in that world because most of the people would just buy the level boosts. I was trying to figure out if I could play the retail game from start to finish in its entirety by questing and exploring and I wasn't sure if I would encounter more people along the way, as I got to later in the game (other than the endgame stuff).
---
So I guess I'll try for a month and see if it fits. Since I got exactly one month until my semester starts. And I hope to find some people to goof around and explore with.
---
Fair
---
Everyone needs. Those stats might be a temporary upgrade but people need gold more. 😛
---
you are saying that but as a person who wants to be optimal with my time i feel i have no choice.
---
bro it’s wow, not an actual competitive game
---
&gt; Please, make the instances harder, so there is actual gratification. 
---
If retail is more gratifying to you, then go back and play that.  Don't  try to mess this up for the rest of us.
---
No lol?
---
/thread
---
If it’s for a mount vendor then if you can’t sell in trade chat. ThenAH has a fee so if you don’t sell you’ve lost money, also the ore/bars are basically the same  as a vendor given the current state of people’s money.
---
Holding them isn’t much better it’s going to take a while for the economy to be stable and you will need the money before then for a mount.
---
Same is true for skinning.
---
Of course every class can participate. The question is if you want to be on a level with afk hunters.
---
But this is where people are getting confused, Method weren't going for World First, it was just an event organised by them. It's not like the last BFA Tier where it was the entire guild competing, it was just an event they were hosting under their brand. Or at least that's how I perceive the whole event. There is a difference between the guild Method and the brand.
---
I think that journey 1-60 is more fun for me then the endgame. I have doubts if I’ll play much when I hit 60.
---
Because 40 randoms in non optimized gear/spec can totally do what, let's face it, professionals did with a highly turned group.
---
This looks like what would happen if someone took classicwow posts and fed them to a bot and asked it to spit out a classicwow post.
---
My question would be - what do you *want* from WoW at this point? Just play another game. WoW is not some "forever-game". There's quite a few games out there that are objectively better than WoW. The idea with Classic is that, you play it for however long you want, then when you are sick of it, leave it alone for a few months/years and it'll be there, waiting for you to pick it back up.
---
That's also the reason why expansions won't be a thing - you can just keep playing vanilla, without having to resort to private servers.
---
Best thing to do is move your character just slightly and that will pop you out of the motion of the wand instantly, and then you can do whatever you want to do faster.
---
&gt; It really puts into perspective why Pservers tend to buff all the bosses.
---
Well monkeynews said after the onyxia kill that it was actually surprisingly "hard", as in way harder than the private server version. So there's that.
---
Yep, mobs don't really hit hard as long as you dont pull too many. Just drop WF and go fuckin nuts. Let the healer drink if you brought one
---
Pally buffs are highly sought after. Rogues and hunters are the true welfare queens
---
Servers going into future expansions is the biggest waste of everyone's time. It splits the player base even more and just leaves everyone wishing their expansion was the one that went down a different path that doesn't result in the pile of garbage that is BfA. They need to just do Classic+ and call it a day.
---
But what if just ONE player decides, he want it because of the gold making opportunity and needs on it, while everyone clicking greed.
---
Here is a thought, does your PC have power saving mode? Say your away for 30min, the PC will go into hybernation mode...
---
Might be why you get dc...
---
Hahaha did those stupid quests yesterday.. What caught me of guard was that he had diffirent spawn points
---
That's... literally what an opinion is...
---
Inspect their character, if they've not got the item on then they are doing what is called ninja looting and intend to sell the item. Report ninja looters.
---
If only Ferdo knew about Wowhead/classicDB/wowwiki/etfuckingcetera
---
Serious question - if there's no more content in Classic after this won't people get bored and leave? I'm all for re living the glory days but I can't see this being sustainable. What am I missing???
---
If I were to play an ally warrior, how much does the racial melee range matter?
---
Escape artist is powerful, sure, but if Gnome's melee is only 6 yards, and dwarves being 7 yards ...
---
Does that mean their whirlwind will have Areas of Effect of 36pi and 49pi, respectively? How much would that matter vs. Escape artist from gnomes?
---
Similarly, for horde, it's Tauren's 8 yards melee vs. Orc's stun resist. Does 8 yards melee mean Tauren whirlwind would have an area of effect of 64pi?
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Makes sense, I always played horde so I guess that explains it.
---
No take away from the stun. It’s crap bro. If the mob is stunned it can’t hit you and if it can’t hit you you don’t generate rage as quickly. Rogues will stun mobs, the group/raid needs you to take as little damage as possible so the healer didn’t OOM.
---
Since being a student i played most of WoW at weekend nights. Wish there was some time-capsule item to turn night into day (just visually and just for me).
---
Hi there :) 
---
It's zygor, fantastic add-on that works brilliantly and thanks 😌
---
My trigger is very specific. It's not pressing that printscreen button on your keyboard.
---
Take what you want there isn’t a right answer. If you’re 100% min/max then tailoring and engineering but it doesn’t matter.
---
Sounds like you might just be stuck on a rather unpopulated layer.  Are there queues when you login?
---
https://youtu.be/vgk-lA12FBk
---
well endgame mythic bosses right now on retail are made for that 1% (way lower actually)
---
ninja looting is an ingame aspect. Is it considered as cheating, and bannable?
---
...just find a mob a few levels lower than you and it climbs fairly quick.
---
Method world first race endings have warped my expectations. I expected loud screaming, shaking stream cams, people jumping up and down, Sco snorting a line off a hookers ass.
---
But that was cool.
---
You should see EU firemaw, I joined the queue at 11:00, came back 20:30 and still was 150th in the queue.
---
Hard to say. Tanks are usually what's missing from dungeon groups, but since the ratio of needed tanks in raids plummets, it's often a lot harder to get a primary tank spot there. Raids will want plenty of offtanks, though. That is, people who DPS 95% of the time, and tank when needed - on trash, or because a regular tank is sick.
---
thanks, good to know. yeah I didnt want to take anger management because i thought "well the priest and mage will stop to eat and drink anyway so my rage will just go back to zero"
---
Ratchet is a neutral city but is still in Horde Territory. PVP can still happen but the guards I believe attack anyone who starts a fight if i recall right.
---
Not much that can be done about it. All 4 healers had horrible dps in vanilla. It was how it was designed and it was intentional. 
---
Anyone rolling classes now knows exactly what the endgame looks like in terms of class roles. 
---
Making changes would be counterproductive. Once you make any changes, where does it stop? Everyone will want changes and then we go to full blown class balancing.
---
I think the only definitive proof some people will settle for is if they do the Onyxia head quest on the server.
---
Well played from APES, I didnt think anyone would be able to do it until Tuesday.
---
Had a mage in RFC who kept going different direction than tank and pulling more.  Eventually, after we complained, he said "I'm doing twice the damage of anyone else here."  Someone linked the meter and he was third.
---
Let the retail players stay in retail in my opinion. They're two different games with very different mentalities. There are plenty of folks who just want classic and thats the kind of people I prefer to play with.
---
so chain killing boars is hard ? tedious, sure. But hard ?
---
First off if you're going to play, you do NOT need a gaming laptop to play. It's a 15 year old game. You could get by on a pretty shitty setup if you played with the classic settings. No need to invest that much money if that's the only game you want to play.
---
Secondly is how much free time a week you really think you'd have to play? 
---
Third would that satisfy your desire and what you want from the game? Would it even be worth it?
---
Lastly do you have addictive tendencies? Would you be okay just playing a couple of times a week and leveling very slow? Would you be able to not let that get in the way of the other things in your life?
---
At the end of the day I think life's too short to put shit you wanna do like that on the back burner. That being said you gotta keep your own wellbeing in mind first.
---
no doesnt, still starter edition
---
did the same!
---
They probably have banks full of frost resist gear already
---
Tailoring + Enchanting is the battle tested combo. I can’t speak for the gold earning potential, but the ability to craft your own bags and wands is very helpful.
---
Selling 6 slot bags for a few silver around Goldshire is a good way to make a few extra bucks early on. Same for wands.
---
Wait whats the point of farming gear if you 1 shot bosses without any ? For pvp i guess ?
---
Lol so much hostility for pointing out the games just as easy without addons for questing, because it's a 15 year old game.
---
I'm enjoying it that's why I'm playing it, the person I replied to was wrong for saying it's the addons since most of us have played the game and know the quests already
---
So unnecessary.
---
While everyone drools over dogshit classic. 
---
The real men were playing Runescape during these times back in the day.
---
Wasn't there a 3 man group that did it, Paladin / Warrior / Hunter?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOKlXklfzzE
---
Same as what others have said, you don't need the stun as a tank bro as you will generate less rage. Definitely recommend getting 5/5 in Parry.
---
You don’t need to be 60 to enter MC, the only people that really need to be are the tanks, and some healers. Most of the Pre-MC BiS stuff can be farmed and used before 60. The other limiting factor, aqual essences, is easily cheesed with AoE farming mages.
---
Oh man that sucks so hard :(( I managed to get it pretty pain free. But I helped out another grp and then I did a macro that targeted Jailor Esbon and cast moonfire on his ass. They where really happy I got him for them
---
I got some green bracers off a zevrah in the barrens and literally exclaimed and scared the shit out of my girlfriend
---
Yes. :(
---
The normal Atlas is available for Classic. I am using it and it works fine
---
I fear the classic hype is a fast birner, very bright but dies quickly.
---
I wonder what's the endgame going to be like.
---
Bruh I got one blue bag and was so damn happy I messaged my brother who is also playing classic
---
## bruh 😝🤤🤡🤡🤡
---
So this is how y’all wanted to experience WoW Classic, huh?
---
Warriors are apparently discouraged from using 2 1h weapons cause of the miss chance so I'd do arms
---
Ugh :( It works, but not for Classic apparently. Sadlife.
---
No one is imposing anything on to you. If I'm making a group, I'm taking a mage over a boomin 100% of the time. Dont try to impose your shitty specs on me.
---
I don't get it. I remember our guild having to farm thorium reputation to make fire resistance gear in order to even be able to stand the fire pulses rag puts out. Did they nerf him or something???
---
Yeah well you guys lost WW1 so it’s Rag.
---
Then that player is trash and karma will work itself out. Just because one person is a douche didn’t make it ok for everyone to be a douche.
---
Why would you want arena when you can jsut go slay some disgusting horde players in STVietnam?
---
Yeah that doesnt work anymore, it was fixed after that one guy made a video, there is deminising returns now. I mean you can still stun lock for awhile but not nearly as long as he was doing
---
Better yet is tackling the queue fundamentals by either increasing server size again or opening free transfers from the top realms to the lower pop realms. Players afk'ing is a side effect of blizzard's choice of opening so little servers before the game went live causing guilds and groups to settle in.
---
So, by "optimizations", you mean "making the game much easier so people who have no time or just doesn't want to enjoy the experience of an mmo can level up in a couple of days and start wiping in raids, because they'll have to nerf them too".
---
People are better at what they practice, who knew? The private servers players wouldn't stand a chance on retail and method didn't stand a chance in lvl 60 &gt; to MC/Onyxia race.
---
I, for one, am a fan of speedrunning and it's pretty sad that starting in phase 2 it'll be impossible to beat the 'world record' because layering will be gone.
---
It's a legitimate record, absolutely, but don't put it in the same bag as no layering runs.
---
Ally attunement quest is a cakewalk compared to Horde.
---
That was AWESOME! :D
---
Us warlock can exchange life for mana
---
Can you explain what a pvp server is like? Is it just the opposing faction that can attack you? Having some random high level player come and kill me while I'm questing just seems like a huge pain in the bum to me.
---
me too! It's like the twilight zone! lol
---
Gehennas is a shit show. But if you sign in before 9 in the morning you'll be fine w/o queue.
---
All good points, however, ragnaros was killed by APES with a bunch of level 50 somethings, in greens. I was telling myself for a long time "it's not the same" because I did progression in molten core when it was relevant and "hard" but now that I see whats possible with only raid frames and no addons I realize we just didn't know a bunch of things about the game. It's not that the game changed, the players changed their skills.
---
Read somewhere here that apparently it happens when you are out of arrows
---
Pratt add-on I think by default it just says [1]: this is a general message. Then numbers or letters for the other channels.
---
Depends how many spells you want her to use...
---
The simple (stupid) way is to simply do a key-bind (I expect many drivers would let you do that, or you'd have to write a bit of software yourself but that takes like a few hours). Then you need to figure out a mapping that could work. Obviously a stick works for moving, maybe the other one to "change action bar" and then you bind all the rest to key-presses 1 to 0 if there's enough buttons.
---
Something like AHK might be able to do the trick? (I don't know if it can get you banned, I don't think so)
---
This solution is a lot less "nice looking" than the ones present online on youtube though.
---
Golemagg had 9,5k today at 12:30.
---
Go home and help your wife.
---
I had the opposite happen, I'm the tank and the first pug I tried WC with wouldn't let me build threat, kept attacking what I wasn't focusing etc. 
---
People just don't get that as tanks at the level of WC we just dont have the skills or gear neccessary for chain pulling or big pulls. 
---
Yes you CAN pull big but your going to kill your priests mana and sometimes they won't be able to keep up at all and have to constantly drink and slow the group down.
---
Why not go the Old School Runescape route? Keep Classic seperate from Retail WoW, introduce new content in Classic while maintaining core aspects. Let players vote on what they want or not.
---
Since when has french been relevant for anything WoW? Hint: never
---
So yes and no. It's the 2004 models and you can emulate the graphics with setting 3 but if you go higher, you get upgraded graphics in Classic compared to Vanilla.
---
I find them fun. I'm level 22 and have had 150/150 fishing and cooking since level 18. Currently on hiatus till I get the 225 books. 
---
Dont think of them as separate since fishing straight up levels your cooking 1 to 1 which makes it less daunting.
---
Personally I'd go for skinning/herbalism during the grind to 60. Rogues really benefit from herbalism as blind requires the reagent of a fade leaf. Skinning is great for the passive income while leveling. As a rogue, you're going to want the Devilsaur set ASAP once 60 as this is pre-raid BiS for ALL melee classes and hunters. You can attempt to farm the leather you need (may need to join your factions Devilsuar mafia). If farming the leather is feasible for your gameplay style, once you've obtained the mats for Devilsuar set, you can drop skinning for Alchemy. Engineering is good for EVERY class, Pvp, and PvE. You can not go wrong. It really just depends on what you want. 
---
Just going to say, as my vanilla main was a rogue, Herbalism is absolutely worth it. If you don't grab it you will need to purchase fade leaves of the auction house in order to use blind. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Happy hunting!
---
Well like I said, people enjoy different things. If the gameplay style in wow classic doesn't suit you, then maybe just quit instead of throwing a tantrum on reddit? And let people enjoy different types of things if they want to. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that no one else would.
---
Auto run still gets you kicked for afk. I tried it last night as finally got to play after 237 minute queue. Sadly my friends had to go to work (overnight) or were in bed already. I stayed up and caught up to them, debating I going to sleep right now or grind some more levels out.
---
You often do DM runs
---
You play a lot
---
You're lvl 20. Makes no sense
---
As a Paladin you need ret and a good weapon for an acceptable leveling speed or team up with someone. I remember  ack in the day that levelling duskwood was super fast becaus of the exorcism skill or what the name was.(ward evil?)
---
After that you have a slow time untill it slows to a crawl at stranglethorn... Paladin is fun...
---
I've been taking [census](https://imgur.com/4FurmTV) scans all week. There's just far too many people on the server. Blizzard really shouldn't have allowed it to get this bad.
---
Jokes on her it's already passed my bedtime and I'm playing in the dark.
---
If I need a 20-30 min break for whatever and plan to play right after why should I log out and be put at the end of an 18k queue? I agree when people do that for hours then they might as well just queue again but I doubt most are doing it for these extended amounts of time.
---
The Prat addon offers all kinds of customization options for the chat: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0)
---
Weeding out the weak quickly we are!
---
I don't generally buy the slippery slope argument, but in this case we've seen its implied conclusion.  So I gotta agree that I'd prefer not having dual spec.  I'm sure there's a private server somewhere with that iteration.
---
BoE is need. BoE=money. He can buy it if he doesn't win
---
Make your first character during peak hours between 5-9 at night.  You will be able to see which realms have no queues then.  I made the mistake of creating a character on a "medium" pop realm at 11 am.  Now the peak hour queue time is 2 hours.
---
That's true, but he said it sucked. It's a good tank wep all the way to 60 with it.
---
Sample size: 1 server
---
You are awfully defensive, it was a genuine question.
---
You're definitely missing the bigger problem here bud.
---
Yes, but you also said in the same sentence that most people don’t consider it an mmo.
---
someone attacked me, they didn't attack :'(
---
This is an ancient screenshot from the original WoW beta of an undead player speaking common in /yell and casting invisibility as a mage. Both of these things were removed on release.
---
i feel attacked by the warrior one
---
Can someone explain me the obsession with pre raid Bis then? Is it all a meme for bad players?
---
Works fine. I've been using exactly this since I got both stances
---
Mainly the arrogance in thinking they were going to get world first 60 easy, then shifting goal to world first ragnaros easy, then shifting goal to world first onyxia and now claiming they invested everything to just ‘host’ others getting world first? Is that even serious?
---
I never played vanilla and hardly played retail so I kind of like the surprise of seeing which dungeons and elites drop certain rare loot :-) But it’s also nice knowing if they’ll have gear that is good for me or not lol
---
someone attacked me, gobelins didn't attack :(
---
It’s not that bad at all. Don’t worry.
---
Its just old people that cant accept they were(or still are) bad at videogames, people didnt know the best specs rotations gear until pretty later on.
---
If people expected vanilla to be hard they are in for a rude awakening, vanilla is not about the bosses its abou the friend we did along the way.
---
Or play on a PVE server?

At level 18, was a huge relief

Players are not better. Players have information that wasn't available or confirmed back in 2004.

This.
---
Secretly skilling the 15% frost debuff for hitting the crits against frozen targets... hoping nobody will notice.... &gt;.&gt;
---
Yes because they make a shit ton of money streaming for a week regardless of them having no chance of winning.
---
Makes sense to me thinking people call Deadmines for DM until Dire maul gets released
---
&gt; But vanilla, your reputation counts.
---
Well, it did before layering and the ability to jump.  Will see if it does or not with it.
---
I have been leveling cooking and fishing on my Warlock as I level. (only 18 currently) Its saving me gold of food that I need to keep my health up so I can Soul Tap more often.
---
You need a really thick skin to play Horde. But there also super toxic communities playing alliance. In the end, you can people with decency in both factions.
---
I tend to not buy every skillup while short on gold. A lot of my shaman stuff isn't used while leveling.
---
Nelf Rouge lv20, swords or daggers? I read a bit about sword mainhand, dagger offhand, but it seems you lose out on some Rouge skills and crit chance (dagger specialization) by going sword for the higher base damage. Is the character tooltip for damage always a safe thing to go off of?
---
The concerning thing is the players said MC felt way undertuned compared to private servers.
---
It's WD for Westfall Dungeon!
---
Ninja looting is not bannable and completely Okey by rules.
---
You might get blacklisted on the server though
---
Money after training is always rough. I was right Bout that ND have a few gold now closing in on 20
---
It may be a punishable offense, but more than anything it's just toxic behaviour and disrespectful.
---
Huge pain but it's part of the game
---
You mean Ironforge? Because you still have to take the deeprun tram
---
With good timing of poly, evoc and cone of cold, wpvp can be very tense and rewarding. If you're into dungeons, maybe ask around to get a solid group and AoE your way through packs to switch up the way people usually run dungeons. You can also do some profs and AoE grinding; humanoids in particular are popular for their combined cloth and green drops
---
Must be the work of the Creators.
---
What is wrong with questing protection minus the slowish progress?
---
In 6 days!?! How is that even possible? This post totally inspired me not okay this game anymore.
---
Levelling to 60 took more than time this time around. Everyone kinda figured out a new way to do it, APES tested it and found it was the most effective for a solid crew, and then they executed it to 60 while all the names you know were still in SM *trying to do the exact same thing*. It's gonna be interesting to see what happens with Nef for sure.
---
For comparison, world first Ragnaros in vanilla 14 years ago:

Is APES a only gnome and dwarf guild? I see alot of gnomes, althought human were the better melee Race

Within a week they'll have good enough gear to keep him from submerging.
---
Oh dude this week has been disgusting, like 18 hours a day every day.  My efficiency is just dumpster tier compared to them.
---
Classic really isn't comparable to Dark Souls at all. Dark Souls is a game of skill, reaction and game knowledge (And overrated in terms of difficulty imo). Classic is a game of dedication and social interaction.
---
This! I started playing first day after 5 hours queue, got to lvl 10 and went to bed.
---
Next day I tried to log in and there was another 5 hour queue. No ty. Moved to Benediction and pop is HIGH and no queue.
---
Had no problem leveling up my druid back to 10 again and made friends along the way!
---
Cheers for telling us what will happen. After it happened.
---
It's not in this phase.
---
No, something skillful isn't the same as following and remembering a route and just doing it for a really long period of time. That's not skill at all. I'm not saying they're not skilled, but that isn't something skilled.
---
Would not recommend it. As a druid you can wear lether and you should.
---
If you go with tailoring, enchantment should be your second profession
---
fucking us servers. no one on eu called it VC in classic. why do u namericans have to make everything so complicated. there is DM for deadmines, then dm east/west

What are some good QoL add-ons people use?

After leaving ESO and coming back to vanilla I miss the quest aspect of ESO pointing you where to go.

is it true MC is way undertuned compared to private servers?

that would be unfortunate

Then what is the upside to a pvp server? To be fair I am only level 20 and have not journeyed into opposing territory yet.
---
I'm having the same issue :(
---
No announcements, no pools, nothing :(
---
Leveled my fishing to 225 for this :')
---
Exactly this. I am horde on one of the new servers and I have had mostly very positive experience.  Are you on a streamer server by chance?
---
It was pretty meh. Stuff happened but not a lot of it. The trailer seemed like it would go at a much faster pace but it really slowed down.
---
if you dont wipe, you probably dont need taht man yconsuables, so you can probably bet they farmed them (probably planned in their leveling)
---
Still cool that it still works, though! Perhaps Blizz can re-release these as well to give people and appetizer? After the queues settle down, of course
---
Ah! Thank you

I was actually really surprised at how often boar meat was dropping in durotar.  I remember it being really sparse back in the day but I'm getting meat off of nearly every boar.

Like i want a macro that casts power word fortitude on someone then whispers them something like "blessings upon you child" so i dont have to type it every time :)
---
dd? truly an underage term
---
You doubt that? I do not.
---
You're telling me, I have a thesis due in 8 weeks. The struggle is real.
---
Normal. The game will be far less frustrating for you.
---
The fact that you're asking this question implies that you aren't a PvP nut for games in general, because otherwise, I suspect you'd have just gone with PvP. So, yeah. Normal.
---
Once the playing field is level, eg. BWL, everything will change.
---
If you are in any sort of hurry, most likely this game is not for you. You are suppose to go very slow and steady. Who cares if you have to spend hours on a quest or two? Thats the point! People get the wrong idea about the pace.
---
Loose - we were not participating
---
That dude is one of the biggest idiots in the history of the forums. p sure he's a troll bc nobody can be such a colossal moron for legit years
---
Because nobody plays retail and there is no teammates for constant mythics, war fronts and expeditions
---
Either. If you like player combat, pvp. If you prefer to quest casually, pve.
---
Princess is something you'll want to group for. Rolf's fate's area is pretty packed, too.
---
Rogue has real survival issues early on. Things will get better once you get dual wield.
---
This tweet is from a week before Classic launched.
---
It’s not PvP by default, don’t listen to people saying you have to play there either. Normal realms such as Pagle are perfectly fine population wise and will be. Classic has far less servers and will be healthily.
---
Key is ask yourself do you want to world PvP or not? Do you want to sea with being ganked? Do you want to possibly not be able to farm certain areas? These are realities of PvP servers.
---
I’ve played both and currently on PvP but play what suits your enjoyment.
---
You overestimate dps. Preshielding is only really appropriate in raids or when the tank is in danger of being gibbed before the first reactive heals can land. Otherwise, let them get their rage.
---
Help me out here. If I were the alliance, why would I let one of Arugals pets, now a Death Knight no less, join the alliance? With the other races I can kind of understand. They were heroes before their death so maybe they still have some pull over there, but the player character is always the emissary. So their chosen-one approach was always a problem for me, but in this particular case, it's the worst emissary they could've send. Maybe not the worst, if they'd sent an orc instead it would've been even worse, but my point still stands I believe ("Greetings Death Knight, welcome to the cathedral of light!" still bothers the hell out of me though).
---
Its a lie actually
---
Part of me would love Blizzard to go "welp, okay, we gonna open up BWL now", followed by AQ and Naxx, just to see how fast they'd actually get through it from launch to KT.
---
Respec costs are the big thing holsing back inflation. Removing them would dramatically change the game's economy.
---
Is it worth using Tiger's fury while leveling my druid? I don't feel it gives quite the value as another Claw.
---
What is this crap?
---
Stop using your keyboard.
---
If the only reason you want to play is to look pretty the the developers have already failed their game.
---
At lv 11?! Where do I find the bubbles?!
---
Dire Maul, Deadmines, Direct Message, Dungeon Master, DeLorean Motor (Corporation).
---
From level 1 and through all the login queue shit...
---
It can't be just that, I had progress in it for a long time, and I had turned in other quests after that progress that were still done
---
Reap the stream revenue of an overhyped event for a week and then gracefully accept their inevitable defeat as they carry home heaps of cash. Who's the real winner now?
---
It's a lot better than my other addictions so it's ok
---
But even the traitor quest is you looking for the entrance to the Defias secret hideout, not looking for the Deadmines. It just happens to be at the same spot. People know where the Deadmines are. There are quests in Stormwind for you to go to the Deadmines, but only the last quest if the Defias brotherhood says that the Deadmines are where the Defias are basing from.
---
Lore wise you'd imagine people would figure it out, but for a newbie in Westfall it is easy to see how the confusion could arise.
---
Yeah the amount of druid hate originally had me down, but seriously who gives a fuck, it'll be fine.
---
It’s hardly different with modern WoW. Video guides from beta/DBM create an overwhelming expectation that everyone should know exactly what to do the second the game goes live it’s just a matter execution rather than any kind of experimentation.
---
you can give balance druid full naxx gear and he will end up doing less dmg than mage in greens due going oom after half a minute.
---
ofc dude once they realised that the once "hard" game was solely based on mechanics that seemed tough back then. It is just a flawed grindy game without mtx by 2019 standards.
---
"I've never cleared anything in vanilla"
---
I did the same to a Druid in stonetalon.Tried to attack me when I was low so I slowed em with R1 Frostbolt and then killed.Must have been a bad Druid cause I thought if you change forms you get rid of the slow?
---
I think trying to select a class based on their 1-10 experience is a mistake.
---
Warlock and priest are fun, though.
---
Freeze trapped a horde outside SM earlier and got a /yell k I L l a N A l
---
Translate that for me.
---
Sword is overall better. Daggers require you to be behind the enemy for the best damage.
---
Yes. It's not worth the time money or effort to sell it on the AH right now. It's not worth hoarding a low value material for future sales. Just vendor it. I'm duo leveling and I'm constantly out of money while my partner with skinning has a 3g at level 15 now.
---
Look at the generalisations you're shooting in your post.
---
Does that sound reasonable to you?
---
In a game like classic it has no place.
---
for sure, as soon as I can't just pop nova and bounce I feel in danger lol
---
Interesting, I'd actually never thought about that last point, healing to get aggro back. It should be noted though that overheating generates no aggro, and healing in general only generates 1.3 threat per point of healing, vs. SoR generating 2.6 per point of damage. Still, could be very efficient in a pinch.
---
I'll keep what you say about imp righteous fury in mind. My palidan is approaching the level where I can start thinking about running Deadmines, but I gotta make sure I've got top of the line gear if I even want a chance.
---
We have been waiting in hours long queue to play the game for a week now. Blizzard is not fixing even queues. They will not fix the ah. Im just being realistic
---
Meanwhile im sitting on my 8k queue on gehennas, waiting to level my 14lvl mage PepeHands
---
Ignore this. It’s just flat out wrong. The server type should align to what play style you like. If you don’t have a desire to PvP or deal with the headache role PvE. If you like PvP then role there.
---
Population is fine in classic.
---
If you actually believe this then, frankly, you're a moron.
---
In most major cities you will have access to gigabit internet right now. Even in the middle of bumfuck arkansas my parents get 15mbps down. 15 years ago they would definitely have been on dial up. That is actually impressive itself, you truly do not understand how insane it would be to provide 100mbps+ to evey nook and cranny of the US. It's truly not feasible
---
Given your statement structure, I'm assuming you're not from the US.
---
I do agree out ISPs are dog shit, dont get me wrong, but most people in the us dont have data caps for their home internet, and the ones that do the cap is usually a literal terabyte a month.
---
I'm lv 11 currently so not so much. (I'm a teacher, it's first week of school, I can play maybe 2hr a day at best and I'm enjoying the shit out of reading the quests and exploring by foot, so I'm not as high as others)
---
Yeah, I’m just referring to WC3. 😁
---
Does that apply to all damage or are you just talking about backstab?
---
It probably is, but I don't have much else to go on, because I barely remember vanilla wow lol.
---
Fuck this game
---
Yeah.....my third server as well. FML......my main is only level 14 because of it.
---
tee hee
---
Yea, they aren't perfect
---
Yep. Being a warlock I was like “waaah..? Okey!”
---
Basing my comment off of MN’s own words from his stream after the kill. If you’re interested go to his stream videos and start watching the stream after the kill from when he shows up in Darnassus.
---
I can confirm,  I murdered a level 20 mage with rezsickness in ratchet.  Guards were nowhere to be seen.
---
I love GW2 and played it since launch but the way they do leveling is horrendous and a big part of why so many people get turned off from it within the first few hours.
---
If you can clear mc with level 50s you can do whatever you want
---
Also the Speckled Tastyfish are in the Classic database on WowHead
---
Does priest shield lower warrior rage generation?
---
Haha yeah at the low levels you can kill a mage just spamming shift. Laters levels they need to kite away from counter spell -&gt; heal or try and tank their dps while you wait for them to oom.
---
Just because an elite group of friends who played classic for 10+ years clears it in a week doesn't mean it's to easy.
---
Generally you have a few options.  Do a little grind killing to gain a level (I don't recommend as the other options are better), join up with other people around the area of the quest which usually makes the quests a lot easier (this is my favorite option to knock out those harder ones, and most people will invite you for these quests if you show up doing the same one and ask them if they're doing it too), or you can travel to another area with more quests (make sure to grab the nearest flight path when you make the journey!).  If you have a quest that wants you to go to a NPC in a town you haven't discovered yet, generally you will find more quests there.
---
Perhaps if she were topless she might have had a more successful attempt!
---
Theres a gnomeland security on every server since vanilla
---
Nop.
---
It is basically the only way I can play with my friends now.
---
I remembered that was a thing last night when I was doing this exact quest chain.
---
yea this really does ruin the experience if a small group just decide to tryhard farm it prehand and the rest of us dont get to experience this cool event.
---
And I can confirm that this isn't true!
---
This is not true, everybody is telling that, but in fact there is no difference. There a some videos on YT showing and explaining the truth
---
Or maybe they're not
---
Bows or Crossbows for a orc Hunter?
---
On Mankrik, the first 2 nights there was a 2 hour plus queue during primetime only.  If you logged on in the morning - no queue.  However, last night during prime time I only had to sit in the queue for 5 minutes.  The realm is high population but not full.
---
Just backstab. Daggers being faster overall have lower damage as a 2.6 speed swords damage will always out do a daggers 1.8 speed, due to sinister strike going off of your weapons damage / speed
---
I did MC 14 years ago I can't even name all the bosses without google. I was just talking out of my ass. Obviously with literal "fuck you melee" mechanics it can't be done with 40 melee characters. The original point was that if MC is cleared 5 days in with barely half the raid level 60 and none even remotely close to pre raid bis then it doesn't matter what you want to play. Just play it.
---
I agree, level 24 priest horde undead it’s so addicting and fun
---
It was clearly marketed as if they were going for world first Ony/MC in Vegas for their commericial. You hop off their dick now :)
---
And Isnt mining important for engineering so I can get the things i need to upgrade it ?
---
You were right, I concede defeat lol.
---
true, but i think progress might want a word about the future firsts.
---
Humankind are simple, chose shit name servers and you'll have very little problems with queuing
---
This is horribly untrue lmao.
---
Where can i find the people that fly you to places
---
Dude chill
---
Sounds like they were right about you
---
this pisses me off. its only been a week. low life trashcans of people.
---
The reward is Harlequin robes for being such a fucking clown
---
How dare you make me witness this with my own two eyes. How dare you.
---
Anyne that uses term VC is auto ignored by me. They are just retarded trolls. No need to communicate or play with them.
---
Do you know if tailoring/engineering works ? I dont know if i have enough to upgrade engineering without mining
---
you dont actually have to swim a lot you can run on the coast just fine.
---
Vendor all of the skins. Unless someone resets the market(which is hard to do on Light Leather), always vendor them. I actually sometimes just delete it I need space for a grey. Always also vendor Medium Leather too. Then mattering on your server, also vendor Heavy Leather. Heavy could be worth it to AH, but most of the time it’s more worth just to vendor it. Even if you would be getting 2 silver less, a couple hours early
---
By the way, there's another thing that I haven't even touched on, a reason why killing Ragnaros with 40 paladins is literally impossible.
---
You know the big AoE fire damage splash with a knockback that Rag periodically casts at a random raid member? Here's how it works - he casts it at a random raid member **with a mana bar**.
---
3/4 of your raid will be melee bunched around Ragnaros and the tank. 3/4 of those spells will hit 3/4 of your raids (including your tank) and knock them into lava.
---
Encountered my first BFA baby yesterday, he wanted a healer for RFC and he invited me (he was level 11 btw which is lower than normal), when he saw I was in UC he said "HS to orgrimmar". I told him my HS wasn't attuned to Org and he started spamming trade chat for another healer while I was already leaving UC. I told him "yo man if you are looking to replace me please tell me right now because I wouldn't come to Orgrimmar if not for the dungeon". He didn't reply and as soon as I reached Barrens and got off the zeppelin, he kicked me from the group. Funnily though, the rest of the group left and invited me on the new one, I shared that story on trade chat without including his name, then people kept asking that I tell them what his name was and as soon as I told them they all put him on ignore. Love that the community is already weeding out the babies. Missed this game so much man I'm so excited.
---
It was also the time when they started removing attunements from bc as well as making core class changes, at least to warrior class.  The hero class was also introduced.  That's why I separated wotlk out.
---
Yeah, raids were never difficult in vanilla (or at least pre AQ), it was getting enough people together who were halfway competent that was the issue. You'd find out last minute 5 guys aren't attuned, the hunter forgot to buy arrows, the warlock didn't get enough shards, and the Paladin is an actual retard. 
---
Now we're seeing well organised guilds that have been doing this shit for *years*. They've got their shit together. These aren't a random PUG, or a guild that has been in existence for 2 weeks, it's veteran players who all know each other. Of course they're not gonna run into all the problems we did back in the day.
---
That is sad. I don't know how many times I stopped the dark iron dwarves from blowing up the dam, and it still got destroyed.
---
Sure they are, just now we wiped in RFC once.  I never wiped in RFC in retail. In Retail 3 dps cleared the entire dungeon within 10 minutes.
---
Yeah that was in vanilla too and it was just as annoying back then.
---
You're gonna get flattened by a respawning mob or an overpull if you zone out too much in classic. The rotation is easier but the situational awareness required is higher.
---
I wonder why no one ever thought of separating the two just by using capslock, dead mines = dm and Dire Maul = DM, since it's deadmines is a lower lvl dungeon it doesn't get upper cased, it's better than calling a dungeon by it's final boss.
---
I first opened up classic around the time Yojamba was released. Started joining Arugal, saw the queue and immediately logged into Yojamba. No regrets at all at this point, although we'll see how the populations go. 
---
Worst queue I had was second day, about 40 minutes at peak time.
---
Marked my targets and they still ignore the skull, sigh
---
Someone else being first didn’t stop any of us in vanilla, it won’t stop us here. Just have a realistic expectation. Are you going to wipe endlessly because players don’t know the fight? 90% are clicker S keying? No. People are exceptionally better than in vanilla. But it’s still going to be a blast and rewarding watching your guild progress and get gear to be ready for the next phase.
---
Honestly I hope they continue classic wow into the expansions. I loved TBC and Wrath
---
And this is why it's always hard to find a tank.  It is the most stressful role in the dungeon, and whether the run fails or succeeds is heavily up to you.
---
Nah it's always been EoE
---
 #nochanges
---
Guess it’s open time they swapped out those buckets
---
World first weeks of prep? No. You or me doing MC will though.
---
Yes, vendor them. In your skills tab you will see a red marker near your professions, click it to remove that prof.
---
he means badly designed to the point that it's unbearable, obviously.
---
Does it really translate to retail? Considering pservers had to guess where each mob is supposed to spawn and what routes they patrol, seems there's a good chance something will go wrong on retail. I heard they had a bit of issues on Onyxia because she behaved differently, that could easily translate to trash pulls as well.
---
I wouldn't think that matters to much. You would have to take that into account and run and extra tank or two.
---
imagine getting caught up in wow tribalism lol
---
I had a guy doing mor'ladin early when I was. We said we'd help each others groups. Our group pulled first and died as his group watched. Sent a "?" only to find I was ignored. Theres some douches out there. 
---
Oh and to top it all off his group somehow took the tag without morladims health regenning.
---
Started in BC and back then it was known as VC.
---
Whatever has the best dps, it is usually bows while leveling.
---
I really want to roll druid, but I keep getting tempted to warrior due to cool af weapons such as the Whirlwind Axe and all that sexy SM gear
---
What cool stuffs do druids have to look forward to?
---
https://gyazo.com/3ec6204b8559b41210c42b706813700d
---
enable 'use raid style party frames'
---
it's perfectly fine for healing.
---
The 2004 community had a looot of awful people
---
There are no BGs in Classic atm so idk wtf you're on about, they weren't in beta either.
---
As a Rogue... Hm.
---
I got stuck on a god damn bucket on the boat to Darkshore....
---
and he doesn't even break a sweat doing his dribbles and stuff. football is obviously a piece of cake just like classic raids.
---
Disconnects and queues screwed some people over
---
Were idiots because we played retail? Great logic.
---
Getting paid to play video games seems a lot better than stacking shelves in my books.
---
No, it is not turned on :/
---
Haha dude same. I just read that you’re supposed to get exp from killing monsters while on your way to quests. Like inbetween quests.
---
Give me and my pet a blessing and I will chase you down and shove a health stone in your pocket
---
she  T H I C C  tho m8m8m8mm8m8
---
But when the nightelf music kicks in... so good
---
Then you realize he has less playtime than ppl who are 40-50s now
---
Haha this was me to my brother last night exactly.  Then I trained and I was like y'all got anymore of those coppers?
---
Game development no, but they owned the company and were the ones merging with AV. At least the company isn't called ActivisionVivendi now.
---
Then uhb, you should've got it?
---
troll necklaces as horde in STV.... Now THAT's something.
---
This is so random I love it
---
The raid frames from retail are in classic and you can use them in a party, go to interface &gt; raid frames &gt; 'use party raid frames' in the top right. You can customize it further in those options rather than just having them all as green bars.
---
Only for mounts. I had friends who only grinded mobs to level, since dungeon groups are hit or miss, didnt bother them a bit.
---
 Bro, when you don't have anything meaningful to say, just don't make a stupid reply next time. What's the point of your comment?
---
Had this when I was rushing in Ratchet on my dwarf, an orc tried to block my bobber. It's safe to say it didn't work, but that's the kind of PvP I can support.
---
No. Every alliance player and NPC is literally Hitler.

---
‘Just a matter of execution’ - you can say that about anything, doing a backflip is just all about research and then bailing execution. Doesn’t make it easy.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who can't decide for shit :)
---
Arms.  Sweeping strikes is super useful leveling and the MS debuff is great on a pvp server.  Also, pick up anger management.
---
I think there are great differences between vanilla, tbc and wotlk so I would divide them seperately all of them. The pacing of the game is just very different. I actually think tbc is closer to wotlk, but wrath is more casual end game.
---
What’s the point of yours?

Dun Morogh doesn't have any passable shoreline. It's all mountains around the edges, so you can't swim directly there. What he's saying he did, was swim from Wetlands to Westfall.

Whoops
---
Anyone that uses the term ' Anyne that uses term VC is auto ignored by me.' is auto-ignored by me.  They are just retarded trolls. No need to communicate or play with them.
---
Having to work for a living is really cutting into my leveling time as well...
---
Better preserve your bottomless, free drinks.
---
They keep streaming as a marketing/publicity tool just like it always was going to be.
---
The okay you toxic filth.
---
I went from Druid to mage cuz I guess I was just burnt out of Druid. Things were tough and the utility is nice but doesn’t lend to a very streamlined leveling experience. Dungeons were fun but you can only do SFK/BFD so many times. Figured it’d also be nice to make an enchanter for whatever I end up rolling with end game
---
You have a great style. It matches the artwork in the game very well. Keep going!
---
If this was something they said after losing then I would fully agree.
---
Druids have drinking problems
---
OS or OS3 on my server. And we also called Maly EoE
---
How do you know faction balance of a server?
---
Dragon soul was kinda cool
---
Method who?
---
Given one of the Guild beating ragnaros had a feral druid, no. Everything is viable if you know what to do, especially since everyone is better than before. I think many guilds wonnt have any problem to bring a feral as main tank in raid
---
I'm assuming it's in a later phase - p4 if it's by the patch correlations they've stated.
---
Who is your edit even replying to ?
---
well there is no arena in classic, but if you think anyone can get even close to the private servers boys in battlegrounds or wild pvp then you're just as wrong as him.
---
also: some private server arena was a lot better than any retail servers, like AT for instance. Hydra said that years ago (he played on both). (Also I couldn't get glad there despite being gladiator all brackets in retail in the second biggest battleground lol )
---
Not socializing properly when you’re younger in lieu of escaping into a video game will definitely have consequences down the road. Many times foregoing immediate “happiness” in order to develop yourself in the real world is a good thing.
---
Laughing under leopard willies
---
Lol, the one hear with a 'high and mighty' act is you bro.
---
I got simulation sickness (like motion sickness) after playing 10 hours on release.
---
Which mod are you using for the party status bars? Looks much cleaner than my healbot
---
They actually made them harder.
---
Hardness resulted in a resist on this one.
---
Doing the same pulls in the same dungeon with 10 people over and over and over and over again
---
Makes for great cookies
---
Definitely pick either Shazzrah or Firemaw. 
---
Largest pop.
---
I know everyone in the thread is celebrating people leaving but it makes me sad, I wish they could find the enjoyment in the game that I have
---
It’s kinda always been like that for hardcore players and guilds.
---
You have to turn on 8x AA and ambient occlusion in the advanced tab in graphics. Makes shades and lighting look really good.
---
all the classes are easy starting out, only having 1 or 2 abilities at level 1, just pick a class that seems fun and then find a race that can play it
---
the starting zones are pretty forgiving, all the enemies are yellow (neutral) meaning they won't attack you unless you attack them first,
---
Mitch.. is that you? We miss you man..

---
wtf, stop lying. shield = no rage
---
I am actually kind of sad about this. I know that we are better players now than when Classic first launched, and we know the mechanics....but I was really hoping that it would take a lot longer before the first raid was done. :(
---
Agree people won't be as strict as before because it isn'rt needed anymore
---
They are European, we dont need to be wage slaves here, plenty of vacation days a year for our hobbies and a 36/40 hour work week is more than enough for an nice lifestyle. Now go back to your 3 jobs to of your medical bills
---
I use my own auto clicker, got a anti afk macro for  2hours and if I am not at home I also have remote desktop on my mobile phone to access wow
---
I'll never leave the server again hahaha
---
I wholeheartedly disagree
---
It’s not pretty sketch. You’re just slow.
---
Imagine doing it for free
---
Eh I find sword and shield play fun, but I like making tanky characters. Higher DPS is cool and all, but you're squishy.
---
God I love this game.

No, it will be kept as it's meant to be

afaik just onyx
---
I wish they didn't revamp the zones. As far as class balance, it was amazing.
---
Hello I never played wow, I'm going for warlock i really need help in some things.   
---
-what profession to pick? 
---
I'm a wow noob and im clueless.
---
Can't holy be a solid leveling spec? It got holy nova and the cast time talent seems huge. The main downside I see is having to sidetrack 10 points (spirit tap+wand spec) instead of 5.
---
Can someone tell me the Addons he using that make the noise ect
---
You’ll love prot at level 60 then. In the meantime you want that 5/5 cruelty and 5/5 tactical mastery if you’re sword/shield tanking dungeons.
---
This first tier was always going to be easier than in vanilla because Rag and Onyxia were easy in v1.12.
---
Next few tiers we'll see more of an authentic experience sand an actual race where guilds are ready for the raid.
---
Oh Lord that brings back painful memories
---
Taught me about fatigue though
---
Ironic.
---
I doubt they ever expected to get any, but why would you shit on them for bringing publicity to a game you want to play ?
---
Purely because they play retail I assume.
---
Well, if you enjoy running in a circle for two hours then this is also fine.
---
There is nothing Blizzard can do about everyone rolling on the server with the coolest name and refusing to leave it despite 10,000+ queues.  Most people are falling victim to FOMO and are terrified of 'low pop' servers when in reality even these are many times bigger than any server in vanilla. 
---
Blizzard has accounted for player drop-off with layering, you don't need to be on a server with 5 hour queues to ensure a healthy late-game.
---
Ive seen hundreds upon hundreds of people botting in inns this week.  Gives me ZERO faith that Blizz knows how to, or cares to, tackle the problem in BGs. 
---
Botting in BGs was one of the things that broke the game for me previously.  I hope they do something about it this time around.
---
it's only been like 6 hours though.
---
If you can have underwater breathing for more than few minutes +the cloth belt, its actually decent spot due to XP+Gold. The route is a nice circuit.
---
But without breathing and belt, its a pain and a waste of time imho...
---
If your HS has cooldown you can use the „I‘m stuck“ menu in the Help-Menu (where you can contact GMs). This will kill you and bring you to the closest graveyard.
---
Yeah, it is actually. Have fun riding the nostalgia train though.
---
Thats not what I said at all though. Where did you come up with that?
---
I mean have these guys even slept? How the hell have they organized 40 people to 60 like that I just don’t get it. I’m sitting here at level 32 and I thought I was playing hard
---
&gt;I would never guess that you could down things this fast i vanilla
---
**You** cant, They did. No reason to let what they can do take away from the fun you are having (assuming you are having fun)
---
Not shitting on them just happy someone else gets world firsts for a change :D
---
It’s not the game. God damn. People blame video games. They blame Star Wars. They blame everything but he conservative hate that is destroying everything. It’s all connected, the same bullsht toxic mentality is all coming from the right, and everyone keeps ignoring. Giving excuses. Completely lying and saying it’s actually Liberals who are the villains. And yet conservatives continue to take the wrong stance in every issue, continue to breed division and hate and exclusion. And they’ve been all over wow classic just as they are all over everything. And everyone who complains about outrage culture and SJWs you are part of the problem. You are literally waging a war against empathy. You look into history and the good guys are never the ones against empathy.
---
But yeah it keep spreading, the lie and everyone believes it, that despite all appearances to the contrary Conservatives MUST be the good guys and Liberals MUST be the bad guys. I mean conservatives keep saying so. Trump keep saying so.  It must be true.
---
There have been a lot of people that claimed it would take weeks for the first.
---
Oh stop. When you find the right kind of gash, most people enjoy them.

too late now

this is why some people had problems with 1.12 at release and 16 debuff slots. many even thought we needed to buff bosses. but now, we've got what we've got, no changing it now

---
It's just funny seeing people complain about the very same things as 15 years ago
---
Not even kidding and with all the future content already known, I really wonder how the playerbase will last.
---
Interesting. Never played vanilla and never raided in retail so it’s just me having thoughts to myself! I’d honestly enjoy seeing surprises to the veterans as they can practice on pservers until they release.
---
You can't control the other 4 people.
---
For any alliance players, “ag ee oo p” in common translates to the horde as “me lo ve u”
---
so almost this whole sub? i literally got harassed for saying it lmfao
---
"no changes" huh? I totally remember layering being in Vanilla WoW.
---
If you're looking for the class that brings the most help and utility out of those three it is Druid. 
---
On a side note, they are the least played class and you only really take 2-3 druid to a raid meaning if you get in, you'll be getting all the loot. 
---
If you go lock, you're rolling against mages and you'll gear up slowly. Likewise, as a druid , being able to heal or tank means finding a dungeon group to join is so simple. You are needed.
---
Check out the spec HOTW/NS for druid. That gives you both the option to tank or heal on demand without respeccing. It's a fantastic option for the first few phases of classic
---
 I hear you were enlisted by Darthalia to wage war on the humans of Hillsbrad.  So jealous I am. . .  
---
While  you're off having all the fun -- slaying humans, pillaging the town,  terrorizing innocent people -- I am stuck standing guard here in Tarren  Mill.  
---
Perhaps you'll take pity on an old Deathguard like myself?   You see I am collecting human skulls.  And you will be fighting humans  for quite some time.  Over the course of your long battle, bring me 30  skulls and I will make it worth your while.
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
While I am for changes I am absolutely not for speedrunning bullshit. That fucked up the entire M+ concept in retail for me.
---
It really only affects small, low-lying creatures. It hid a lion from me so I think it's worth it.
---
Could always go a Diablo route, no? Introduce seasons as a Classic+ mechanic a year down the line and change difficulty each season. New gear each season built around the same core gameplay.
---
Are you dense? That boss is exctly the same as the original.
---
🦀🦀Twitter isn’t customer support🦀🦀
---
Can they tank in current classic? RFC for instance.
---
Indeed! Combat spec for solo play if you are rushing to level, sub spec for fun or duo/trio. Can’t wait to improve my ambush with talents, it’s already hitting like a truck
---
&gt;This first tier was always going to be easier than in vanilla because Rag and Onyxia were easy in v1.12.
---
They were also easy at the start. People really need to stop trying to put that on changes that happened.
---
Either sell on AH or swap for the durability so you dont have to pay as much for repair
---
Honestly, I'm trying to help as many people as I can. I buff anyone that needs MotW and if someone needs healing or help killing a mob, I tag along and let them tag it first.
---
It's my first time in classic and I really want to have fun and just experience the game. When I get salty on a character, I swap out to a different toon and play there for a bit. So far warrior has tilted me the most. The amount of times I've died from accidentally pulling 2 mobs is unbelievable. People have just watched me die instead of helping. I hope those are the people that leave, because they aren't the type of people I was told classic would hold.
---
Maybe theyve levelled and are playing with friends who levelled.
---
Ill tank dungeons and heal raids as heart of the wild/nature's swiftness spec.
---
If you are dead set on going DPS go something different.
---
This was a funny because it reveals a lot about the other poster.
---
One is a boe with a lvl requirement and the other is a quest reward?
---
&gt;Please use your brain next time before you write a post
---
We all know this is for Classic, you're just being pedantic for absoloutly no fucking reason other than being an edgelord.
---
People are 10 man stacking dungeons currently and the exp is so drastic that they are just boosting through, People are doing it in SM and getting about 6 exp bars a clear.
---
I mean I was apart of a guild that did the same in archeage but I wouldn’t have called them professionals either lol
---
Definitely used VC, definitely don't give a fuck at 30.
---
Who's got time to care?
---
let's be honest though APES are probably stinky no life nerds
---
I mean they already blew up MC and Ony. Why would they start losing now.
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with looking like a sensible adventurer. I will never understand the hate transmog gets.
---
Hahaha fuck, perfect scene!
---
Right but on average its 625 kills to see one
---
Oh!  I think you can take the tram in the Dwarven district straight to Ironforge.  I'm sorry I'm really trying to help but it's just been like a decade since I played/played alliance lol
---
Find a guard in Stormwind and ask about the flight path, but I am 99 percent sure it's in the Trade district near the big wall at the front of the city
---
There were some surveys before the classic release. Also RP/RPPVP servers are mostly alliance sided.
---
Is a lvl16 priest really too low to heal Wailing Caverns?
---
I’ll take massive assumptions from anecdotal evidence for 500, Alex.
---
Kill quests and collect quests are MMO bread and butter, they're typically just setting the stage for more interesting spontaneous interactions to happen (the social aspect of the game, usually).
---
It’s not. Unless you’re extremely dense.
---
Cue the waterworks. What a great story.
---
You're just some random person. Want to learn a new skill? Pay up to be taught.
---
That was a joke lol, you fell right into it.
---
Yeah
---
Twitch chat emote
---
Yeah you are right sorry haha. Equalled $1 to 1gp instead of 1m go. So would be over $1000...
---
Wow I said this months ago and my inbox was blown up with angry people and I had dozens of downvoted!
---
fuck these questions are adorable
---
Ah. But isn’t this the premise of the horde to begin with? Weren’t they all treated this way by the alliance? And yet, I suppose you are right - every person should still be accountable for their actions, regardless of the cause for doing them.
---
They should just stop spamming and sell gold on eBay, like they did in the early 2000's.  lol

They have been farming Rag for years, probably in the hundreds of kills at this point, it's nothing new for them just another fresh server.
---
Who cares, man?
---
Take it slow. Enjoy the ride. Endgame content ain't going anywhere.
---
r/gatekeeper
---
Sounds way more fun to be you and your friend to be honest.
---
Backflips don’t have an element of lore/story to it. 
---
But even with that aside. I guess most people are focused on just completing the content. I enjoy figuring things out myself, especially in games. 90% of my enjoyment is sapped when playing with people that already know what to do, not because they did it and figured it out for themselves, but because they watched someone else do it.
---
The sense that we overcame something is greatly diminished. 
---
Ever been in an escape room before? Sure it’s kind of neat when someone explains how it all works. But it absolutely robs you of a huge part of the experience.
---
Easier when the chaff separates itself
---
Have you ever made a comment on Reddit that isnt shit talking someone like a 14 year old?
---
where can i find party to  ragefire chasm? I'm 15 mage
---
Hello fellow mirage Raceway horde!
---
This guy gets it
---
.......
---
even if they prefarm it and complete themselves, you can still experience the gate opening (assuming it wont be opened 4am monday :p )
---
murder is rude.
---
You are paid to tank. Pretty straight forward
---
Very few world first? I suggest you to take a look at how much world first they didn't have on wow progress, they did world first on almost everything since MoP, if there are better guilds then what are they doing?
---
What's strange about it? Yes I am saying that the people in Method are more talented than the people in Apes. It's a logical assumption to make. The same way someone would guess that the French national team could easily smash a 3rd division league if they played in it, and that the best 3rd division team would do way worse in the world cup.
---
Playing private server requires no creativity or adaptability. For retail you need to come up with new strats, theorycraft, sim lots of stuff to find out what you need to do optimal dmg etc. Vanilla isn't like this. Mechanically it's way, way easier than retail. Most rotations are just a one button spam. On top of that, you don't need to come up with new strats as everything has already been broken down and figured out.
---
They're just a different calibres of players. Are there some people from APES who could do really well on retail and join a guild like Method? I'm sure there are. But they're a minority, and APES as a guild wouldn't be able to compete.
---
Got my first kill today! Frost shocked a gnome with resurrection sickness running through barrens.
---
You're right, and I love that. I'm not another medic in The Horde, doing my part, though some of what you end up doing could certainly be considered heroic, in some meaning of the word.
---
Depends on who you're :-) I'm playing the game super casually in a guild filled with friends that aim to get 60 in 3 months time. 
---
Doesn't matter to us :)
---
I think you overestimate apes.
---
They literally have no reaction.
---
Yeah... same, and world first rag and onyxia on that realm ain't helping :P
---
Harpies...harpy drop rates feel so much lower than anything else i've experience so far.  
---
That being said i'm absolutely loving the game, have two characters just about 10 as of yesterday.
---
Then you can reroll on another server.
---
Great, 3 more rends, 2 more sunders and 3 more viper stings!
---
They basically survived a zombie invasion. In nearly every zombie apocalypse scenario built in modern culture, even the best people will likely stoop to incredible lows just to survive - even attacking other people for their resources. Sadly, this makes them a very realistic survival reaction.
---
+1000% movement speed
---
Mats are really really really cheap right now. Take gathering professions and buy engineering mats, bank them, and level it later.
---
It's not really figuring stuff out when there are in game tabs to give you the raid mechanics though...
---
I'd imagine you become proficient in dungeons and sell yourself. If WoW is like any other MMORPG then tanks are the most scarce class at end game and people will be willing to buy your services.
---
I like amalgamanteau.
---
Why don't *you* clear Rag easily before getting demotivated. Organizing 40 players, teaching the fights to new players, having enough of them execute properly. The mechanics may be relatively easy, but don't think that just because a group of the most experienced players did this that you and 39 randoms can walk in there and slam through with no wipes.
---
.. or fewer kills
---
He’s obviously alliance... 😂
---
Mate, I spend literally an hour last night farming 6 fangs from nightsabers in darkshore. You've gotten lucky!
---
Completely agree. I LOVE classic so far. I played retail off and on but couldnt get into it because nothing really mattered. While leveling my shaman i bought a shield from a vendor. First time I ever used a vendor item like that.
---
The average joe won't even be 60 in a month, or likely anywhere near to it. Only the ultra-mega nolifers are already/almost 60.
---
Even the next step down from them, with the hardcore-but-not-quite nolifer level of players like the twitch streamers are barely at or beyond the halfway point to 60 (41-ish).
---
I haven't exactly been trying to level quickly, what with doing some pvp and leveling tradeskills, but I'm above what would be considered an average joe. I've put in some serious fucking hours over this week and am only mid 20's on my main and 14 on an alt.
---
ah yes, alliance cowards, standing in a horde capital, nooo the horde honorably 50v1 ganks. yes. loktar ogar
---
Mr. ChadBroChill is mainly posting in the subs /r/Testosterone, /r/steroids - of course he is taking the chance to prove his superiority.
---
How do you do that? Hotkey-ing skull or something? That sounds so useful
---
Did you just not look at the link I posted? A link to their own site detailing the raid history of wow? They by their own count don’t have many world firsts.
---
i wonder how deep they would hang
---
If you remove a profession and pick it up again is it reset to level 1?
---
Vudoh
---
You can fish in main cities like Stormwind at any level of fishing I believe
---
Just sent this to my rogue friend. Must carry the tradition
---
I don't know why some people are salty about this. It's a group of people who have set out with one goal and a heap of experience to call on.
---
Myself, I've never done MC and am looking forward to running it on a few months time.
---
&gt; And remember, no one was ever really saying classic WoW was 'hard.' 
---
🤥 Literally got harassed here and mass down voted but tell me more about how that definitely never happened
---
You ok dude?
---
Under city
---
In ratchet the goblins are scarce and spread out so they may not see it happen.
---
By the time BGs are released you will have more than enough gold to respec. Like by far.
---
Clowned myself i dont have any flight paths connected to where i want to go. Imma just find a group to do hogger with
---
Is this the exact same version of WoW from release? Is anything improved like graphics or ui? Is there a monthly fee? I played WoW for many years when it came out but I'm genuinely confused about the excitement for it to come back. For me, it was a big part of my teens, but like many people I got over it and moved on. I couldn't really imagine doing it all over again without anything being different.
---
2/100 to not lose the roll (if ties can happen), 98/100 to lose the roll
---
Multiple forms: Cat, Bear, and Aquatic. You're an all terrain class right there.
---
Being able to heal yourself is MASSIVE, means you can grind non-stop.
---
Flexibility to cover whatever role the group needs (damage, heal, tank)
---
Stealth!
---
Yeah it's super jarring in Retail whenever I see some Orc in Draenor saying "Look, that's Ken, the best druid who ever lived!". Part of that is my fault for just naming my character "Ken", but I feel like with WoD Blizzard made a hard pivot to making your chracter feel like the central character, the singular Hero of Azeroth. It just feels like a single-player game at that point.
---
I started vendoring scraps, light leather when I started as I had mining as my other profession, upon realising that ore stacks to 10 and vendors for little I dropped mining for leather working so I've started to vendor everything I've been crafting.
---
175/225 at the moment.
---
If you want to earn money then vendor everything you get in my opinion as prices would crash eventually
---
have a clip  for that?
---
I totally forgot about that....
---
Why you gotta hate like that?
---
Nope.
---
You have to figure out how to deal with the mechanics. WF guilds go in having to figure out tactics. Just because you know an ability is happening doesn't mean you know how to deal with it. And it doesn't happen in a vacuum either. You might figure out a strat that works, but later on in the fight something else happens that renders the strat useless, so you need to come up with a new way.
---
It's just that you're really bad at cutting them off so you keep mangling them.
---
I agree. This was well put
---
So they waited a decade for classic to be released and their response is to rush though all the content as fast as possible? Dumb.
---
The people who never played vanilla are trying to rewrite history
---
Whats the diffrence? I didnt see any.
---
Looks just like the one ive tanked, healed, dpsed a million times.
---
&gt;The sad part is, everyone on here swore a 2005 game is so difficult and downvoted me for saying they're deluded by nostalgia, and these people are clearing raids on day 4 with no wipes. lmfao hard btw it'll take months btw
---
Le epic hive-mind cope.
---
I love how coincidental this is.
---
Should I level as Shadow or Holy for my priest? I do want to do dungeons and group content but also like questing.
---
Is it true that Shadow can heal most content while leveling?
---
I just switched to 2h fury from arms and like it a lot more for leveling. I felt like arms was so lackluster. I see a noticeable difference in my crit chance now that I’m fury. My shouts last longer, and I have a small passive head if crit. And attack speed boost to attack more and get more rage. Arms is too slow for me
---
Ha just did this with a buddy. He got 10 before I got one. He logged off for work a d the next 9 mobs dropped me ears.

Vivendi took over Activision.  You guys are obsessed by the name, and the fact they kept the CEO from the lesser partner, but the merger was 51/49 vivendi over activision.
---
Every Blizzard game you’ve ever played was made while they were wholly owned by a publisher.
---
I’m tired of people trying to show off their woke-ness on the state of Blizzard when they don’t know shit about them or the games industry in general.
---
There’s maybe one dude who’s actually complained about the state of blizzard, and he’s a conman and a narcissist.
---
If I backstab a human - instantly killing him/her, why does his skull break?
---
Had a dm run wiped once on van cleef and our retail player insta quit the party even though I was alive and was rezing everyone at the boat
---
That’s what happens when you’re a kid used to retail. I hope more people drop out like this fool.
---
It's a game. If they didn't enjoy it, they wouldn't be doing it.
---
It's still appreciated
---
I've experienced this both on Grobbulus and Deviate Delight (where I currently play), so I don't think that's it.
---
I went into System settings and noticed, under Network tab, there's an "Optimize for Speed" setting which, when unchecked, says, "May eliminate some disconnection issues."
---
I unchecked this.  So far, no more disconnects.  I'll report back if this continues working.
---
"I'm so fucking good, I'm in charge, you cannot do anything without my permission"
---
I think I know who the asshole is in this story.
---
agreed
---
Durotar until 55, org until 75, Barrens until 150ish, then ashenvale for bristle whisker catfish.  Use lures.  Should take you to 150 cooking/fishing in a few hours.  I'm at 225 fishing and 175ish cooking right now.  It's actually a decent way to make money too, almost nobody is leveling fishing so every time you run by a lake or river you will probably find pools.  Firefin snapper and oily whateverthey'recalled are pretty common and should make money too, I'm personally hoarding them until people are hitting 60 and have gold to burn.  The junk boxes gave me all the silk and heavy leather I needed for 4 silk bags, and like 4 stacks of the square hp pots.  It will really pay off when you get to a zone that has fish pools that you can turn into a great buff for your class.  I started working on cooking by about lvl15, now 28, and I have had a constant supply of +stam/spirit buff food just from the cookable drops I get from killing mobs as I quest.
---
It wold definitely be faster to level without doing it, but I hate the idea of skipping all those pools while I'm going through the whole world doing quests anyways.  Plus I think I'm starting to get carpal tunnel so fishing breaks are a good way to still be making character progress while getting to rest/stretch my wrist.  Another way to look at it is this; if you grind it now and then just maintain it as you level, you won't have to spend 12 hours straight running around the entire world just to fish while making no other progress.
---
That said if you're on bigglesworth please don't level fishing, I like having no competition for the pools.
---
No, classic is about the experience, the journey, the community just as vanilla was. The expectation of harder raids for the purpose of speed running misses the whole point of why classic is in demand when retail offers all that bollocks.
---
As someone else said, melee weapons for hunters are typically stat sticks, so whatever weapon has the most +agility on it typically.
---
I bet you feel stupid now
---
large blue sack? don't get it, explain pls
---
You should try pushing +15s and above.
---
This is the kind of people that ruin games. Props for their effort nut damn. Cheel.
---
Clear times are irrelevant though. All that matters is if you can clear it or not. You don't get extra loot for doing it faster etc.
---
If you don't completely mess up your build, you will be viable in a raid, even if you aren't top tier dps, you aren't THAT far behind as you guys are making it out to be.
---
Cata dungeons at release were fucking Golden
---
Not lost, it's a spam account
---
The points in heroic is kinda useless since you wont be usigneret heroic Strike at all after 30
---
Does this addon work in classic?? Thanks!
---
Get an auction house addon. Scan the auction house fully once when you log on (it may take a while so log on earlier to do it) and it will analyze the market on your server and will give you a good idea what items sell big on the AH and will help you decide a prize to cut out the competition.
---
Same 😕
---
Mining ore or bars are usually 3-4x vendor price in my realm. Same for cloth..
---
Never vendoring this is how you make gold.
---
&gt; opening free transfers from the top realms to the lower pop realms.
---
Given that people didn't want to move off the top realms even when new realms opened, sadly, very little chance without incentive.
---
Server reset was merely a setback
---
Pro tip. Just buy the essential skills that you really need and then buy the rest when you have the spare gold =) Got to save for that level 40 mount.
---
Legion took it to the extreme; here hero have the most powerful artifact weapon on the planet, you are the ONLY one capable of wielding it, now go fourth and defeat the literal Devil of this universe.
---
Some pservers were online longer than vanilla wow on retail, as it was called back then.
---
Next to that, most encounters were tuned up for people not to get bored.
---
This one must've been a breeze for them.
---
No that’s Wrath, the spiky/horned shoulders are a dead giveaway
---
I'm pretty sure that the quests for the class mount (especially Paladin) still cost almost as much as the mount for a regular player in mats and items, but I might be wrong
---
I get that and it’s nice to relive the challenge. But I really miss the old feeling wow had on release if that sense? Not to detract from the achievement at all at getting geared up and raid ready so fast. But for me classic wow was about the journey and meeting mates on the way. Not fast paced endgame racing. I miss the 40 man old school mc runs. Wipe after wipe. Everyone getting more drunk in teamspeak as the night went on. Wow lost a lot of that enjoyment for me. The bonding running 5 man straths etc.Having to think about cc and it actually being fun. I hope the classic servers can show new players what it was like in 2006. That’s what wow has lost over the years since.
---
I’m level 7.
---
Being that tanks are the hardest role to fill in a group, and some dungeons are especially hard to do and/or get a group for, it might be worth your time (if you have quests or need a piece of loot) to try and just pay somebody to help you do it. It's not really a practical way to get gold, but if you're grinding for your own gear or exp. or want greens to disenchant, it's certainly not BAD.
---
Coming from a rogue perspective, pls pull the mob u tank 3 steps back so i can get behind them without pulling. Its the only reason i ever pull mobs in dungeons.
---
Defensive? I was just stating what they are doing with the event :D
---
You'll wamt to respec arms at 40 either way for Mortal Strike because that move is fantastic!
---
Stronger "lol".
---
All you really need to level is 5 points in the spirit tap talent and 5 points in the wand spec talent. Get a decent wand and leveling will be super smooth. You can absolutely heal 5-mans up through early 50s. Get those talents, then just do what seems fun!

This is the issue I don’t see many talking about, the queues are just going to pop back right up after every new phase is announced. 
---
Imagine how fun as fuck wpvp is going to be in phase 2, and how so many people just wont log off period for that honor grind. Not to mention future raids, as you’ve said. .
---
If someone was having a high school party at my place I’d do the same

---
Never played wow in my life is it worth as in the time il waste on it
---
LEGENDARY!!!
---
Yea, play what you want. We had the difficulty of things all wrong
---
Im planning an RP of a pro authoritarian gnome whose believe gnomes are sort of a master race.  Working on some backstory while moving around.
---
You also didn't play for 3-4 days in game yet. I have two jobs, wife, kids, and have barely gotten 5 hours played to get to lvl 15 in. You and I have *way* different perspective than world firsts.
---
Awesome. About to hit 19 and get those 10 points done :)
---
I like manually swapping stances by binding them to my mousewheel, scroll up is battle stance, middle click for def stance, scroll down for zerker. Ive gotten really quick at it, and its more fun than clicking a macro imo.
---
There is an imaginary person a lot of these guys are arguing with, or at least not the posters they are replying to.
---
Oh, so they only throw tantrums if you break it to them they’re blinded by nostalgia got it
---
To get these exact rolls though ( a 2 and then a 1 ) is 1/10000
---
Every raid from here on out will be cleared in maximum 5 hours. Not even AQ or Naxx have complex "tactics". It doesn't take a hardcore guild to clear them, the only reason Apes was the first was because they leveled the fastest. In the coming weeks everybody who tries it will clear  MC and Ony.
---
&gt; Tank wielding a 2hander? Sorry for your loss.
---
Oh god why would you make me remember that
---
We’re talking about instance farming. I’ve been doing it with random people since level 20. Almost 42 now. It’s boring and I wish blizzard would do something about it. You just invite all aoe classes to the group and chain. Pull. Super easy
---
The fact that you're not like 12 years old is really fucking depressing.
---
yea maybe, one of the things im most excited about in classic. is getting ganked and having my main be in the same zone logged out, excited for the day
---
Lmao its basically what I do. Maybe throw a Renew in there to top myself off and not die.
---
Fairbanks there uh...aren't many warlocks
---
Let the game settle for awhile and get to a point where people have money and spare bags and stuff, so you can send her some alt gear and stuff. The game should be pretty manageable for her and your second or third character by then! :)
---
Doesnt mean people won't be gearing up for it already.
---
Yes, idk why anyone is telling you other things. You don't have to do the starting zones for the other races.
---
theres always someone that has to ruin it for everyone else
---
Questie clutters the map so much i hate it, and CC lets you easily filter which quests you want to display, sometimes i only want to track one quest so it's easy to locate on the map. CC puts an exclamation mark above a quest mobs nameplate which is very handy.
---
Appreciate it!
---
All of them really are jokes even compared to HC Retail raids.
---
And clearly you don't  even need 40 people. How about capping it at 25,without changing anything else?
---
I tank in Arms. I'm not leveling prot and I'm not gonna respec everytime I wanna run a dungeon. Tanking in fury is fine.
---
Plus for the next phase everyone will be 60 and full MC epic geared, BWL will literally be yeeted away one or two hours after the phase patch comes
---
Exactly. If Method had the world first in this regard, people would be stroking them so hard that Pornhub would get royalties.
---
I’d go with tailoring for at least one of your professions. With tailoring you can craft cloth items for your warlock with cloth you pick up here and there. Second profession is up to you, I think it’s pretty common for people to choose enchanting with tailoring that way you can make wands which I believe are in pretty high demand for casters. So I’d go for that or a gathering profession like herb, skinning, or mining for some extra gold
---
Depends on quest, getting bear toungs has been painful.. I think I get 1 in 10 kills. But overall it's fine, nothing I haven't done before lol.
---
Man I could not give 2 shits about any of this streamer crap. Especially when people create beef and drama for it
---
I also figured out why I couldn’t tank.  Rolled a paladin.  
---
JK.  It is rough and consumes a bit of mana and if people start attacking before I do there isn’t much I can do to peel them off and the healer goes OOM patching them up instead.
---
Gotta find the right one.  Usually when servers go fresh there is an absolute shit ton of shitty guilds.  Good luck.
---
I’m grinding in Barnes right now as well. From my vanilla days, I remember Barrens being my 15-25 zone.
---
It’s still good to explore other areas as well though. Usually every 3 levels or so I’ll take a quest break and run to another city.
---
Is it though? I know everyone says spirit tap first but I’m a wand priest and never have mana issues so I go right into improved bubble. Works better for me.
---
Check the date mate
---
&gt; "Why do so many people believe Method are competing?"
---
Fair. I just thought people would tune in for 5m to see that they're only hosting the event and it's primarily entertainers but ok.
---
What happened?
---
If its mining, check your AH prices. I can sell easily 3x or 4x vendor price. Specially ores for leveling mining
---
Cry a river
---
You'd think my character would be smart enough not to aim for the head when he's specifically send out to gather intact human skulls.
---
Great, thank you! ❤️
---
"Plays like it does back in 2006"
---
A Sunday comic can get this correct, but all those "hardcore old vanilla players" can't stop parroting 2004...
---
damn heres one of the guys that threw a tantrum over this a few months ago
---
Any raid boss in BfA is literally following and remembering a routine.  Whether it is mechanic timings or DPS rotations, it’s all memorization and doing it a lot. 
---
Your argument can be used against any achievement in retail PvE.
---
Hey r/classicwow!
---
Since I created the [phase logo banners](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bkwmdz/logos_i_made_for_each_phases_highlights/) a while back people have asked me how I made them, what resources I used etc.
---
So I [decided to make a downloadable DIY Photoshop template](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2398) that people can use to make 1000x400px resolution logos for their Classic WoW guilds, websites, or whatever they want in a similar style.
---
The templates have multiple types and colours of borders, backgrounds, textures, embellishments, fonts that you can select/deselect to make your logo.
---
I have also included instructions on how to set things up before you start work, and some useful tips on crafting your banner.

youll have to enter this each time u load the game
---
Hardly because of the mechanics and memorization more that people had no fucking clue how to play the game back then.
---
The only quest so far where the droprate was noticeably low was the one with Gray Bear Tongues / Creeper Ichor from Tarren Mill. Still didn't spend more than 1/3rd of a level there (at 23) so hardly a grind.
---
As a mage, I can tell you that I’ve fucked so many warlocks out of tags that I’m surprised not a single one has cussed me out. Please don’t yell at me, I have levels to grind, too.
---
just turn down clutter and stuff then
---
We had such long queues that when I moved on Wednesday to a new server I got to a higher level than I had on the first server in less time than I would have been in the queue to get back on. Honestly redoing 10 hours of levelling is better than queuing for 10 hours every day for at least a couple of weeks.
---
Im currently doing a field study just outside of Ironforge, and a similar thing is happening with the boars there, except that their ribs have gone away.
---
Very strange indeed.
---
They are all PvPers. They will all pretty much eventually be R13/R14, and gnome and dwarf racials are incredible.
---
It is still against ToS but this is WoW, rules do not get enforced.
---
a lot of guys killed Onixia by group of 3! ppl. and 1 druid killed her SOLO. WTF bullshit are you talking about?
---
Vanilla always was easy, just players were TRASH back in 2005. And all that coolstorybobs about "HARDORE TRUE VANILLA WOW"  just are their wet excuses.
---
Man I've killed so many already. Some stupid gnome rougess in stonetalon 5 levels above me showed up 3 times and I killed her each time, some half dead human there too who spit on me before I ended her miserable life. Then I found 3 on the way from splintertree post to BFD, one little warlock whom I annihilated, one human paladin who resisted valiantly, but full heals and an invincibility bubble were nothing against the might of the elements, and a rouge that thought he could help the paladin. He was mistaken. Finally, there was the slaughter at the dead mines where my group and I decided to run deadlines at 25+ and we found quite a number of ally in the high teens low 20s willing to engage, and we felled many that day, at least 20 before being forced to retreat by their sheer numbers. No lack of honor shall keep those alliance scum safe.
---
Around level 30 you get a quest to get "Helcular's Rod" in hillsbrad (Horde). It drops off yetis. Depending on the location you grind, it's either a 1/200 or 1/1000 drop.
---
See with my group, we got this quest done in 1 run. Guess the RNG gods were with us
---
Pff casual, use your passengers thighs as a mousepad!
---
Nah. I was only soapboxing about how US internet sucks. You dared to challenge that and open up the conversation to more subjects. You really have only yourself to blame, mate.
---
I don't think this is low effort.
---
we can though.
---
If you have your 60% mount or enough gold to cover it, I would start leveling engineering.
---
Subbed to your channel! Gotta love wholesome classic content 👍
---
Just take whatever is best for you at the time. Staves, daggers, maces, offhands, etc... it really doesn't matter take what's best.
---
Once you're mid 30's run SM Library and the last boss drops a staff or dagger that will carry you a long way.
---
If you treat the fight as begun when shield bursts it's exactly the same but the warri got a little bit of damage off so in theory it's better. I don't do it tho such minimal payoff and too much hussle
---
Got a chuckle then I saw the pet name and died
---
Dang unfortunate for me. I decided last night to switch my professions and then realized I should be kept my old ones to make some money :p
---
So play a game that is actually designed for PvP, like CS or DotA or whatever
---
The layering issue is horrific. They should take each layer and make it into its own server at this point.
---
I forgot this is a thing
---
Your weapon is a stat stick, anything with int, spirit, spell power. 
---
Your wand is where your damage comes from, make sure you always have a good wand
---
What’s the best way to grind money for my level 40 mount?
---
You absolutely do get more loot for clearing it faster... If it takes your guild 1 month to kill rag you miss on 4 weeks of loot from the bosses you didn't kill.
---
Classic WoW wasn't even on my radar last week but whatever helps you sleep at night man.
---
Nobody needs to. The fights are obviously easy enough that there will be pugs running this in a months time.

---
Best professions for orc warlock? I am thinking going herbalism, alchemy, first aid then switching one out for engineering for pvp at high level. But what about tailoring/enchanting?
---
Your welcome! Don’t worry, you’ll find a Guild to raid with even as an enhancement shaman. Not every guild is minmaxing, and 300 dps (achievable for fresh 60 enhancers in a raid) is alright for MC and Onyxia. You’ll be loved by your raid if you manage to get your hands on a Nightfall Axe, you might wanna save up for that as that thing alone will get you a guaranteed spot in the raid. Good luck man!
---
It also doubles as a fishing pole!

I just hit lvl 13 yesterday lol.
---
Ok that's cool, but no one here plays or knows about retail, so weird flex. It's not even wow it's just an FFXIV rip off raid wise.
---
9/10 guilds won't kill KT first reset let alone day one.
---
[Here you go](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/dungeons/)
---
The trick is to do the first couple of bits, head to dark shore for a few levels then back to loch Modan to finish off there.
---
You have self heals.  What could kill you?
---
you can use auto unstuck to teleport to a graveyard too
---
I use raid frames in party, with class colored bars and move it closer to the center of my screen near my bars for easy clicking. My screen is so wide that standard party frames are way too far to the side and out of the action.
---
You probably already know you don’t have to use your biggest heals which are mana hogs. I heal as pally so that may be different for priests.
---
Stay geared. When in town search AH for OWL and pick up any new slots that come available like neck, shoulder, head, etc.
---
Don’t be afraid to tell dps they’re off tanking and making your life tough on big pulls but usually on small pulls it shouldn’t matter.
---
My ally friends and I did a 1am run of WC the other day, we made sure to /wave at everyone coming through while we waited for our party lol. No one bothered us thankfully (but our friends did get repeat ganked on the way over lol!)
---
I reached 1 gold at level 16, now i am stuck on queue again.
---
I abandoned my first server because it barely managed to get to medium last friday evening.
---
For the Horde, son.
---
You’re welcome to ninja if you’re cool with never going thru an instance with that group or the people they tell about you again, plus potentially getting removed from the group. 
---
It’s an idiot, immature thing to do, very short sighted and will only benefit you marginally compared to the negative consequences that could occur later.
---
Go to your keybindings and check to see which key run/walk is bound to but it should by default be / on the numeric keypad.
---
That's weird, I've had no problem finding regular dungeons.
---
Yeah it’s pretty yikes that’s for sure
---
Good for you, me i a stuck at queue for Shazrah over 10K, since yesterday, not joking.
---
Don't feel bad. When I first started, I thought Agility increase my Movement Speed.
---
If it's at goldshire it won't be much of a 1v1
---
This is mad demoralizing. Congrats though...
---
Hey I'm just glad I'm playing on a chill server. I don't think there's anybody who's level 60 yet on Kirtonos.
---
Like I said, some will bring one, some won't. I don't see where we're disagreeing.
---
Ahhh i see. My b
---
Or just use the "character stuck" option in the help tab.
---
Would recommend a fella by the name of Skarm on youtube who's been tanking vanilla as druid and warrior for years and years.
---
Yea, one thing i noticed about Classic is how good the atmosphere and weather effects are. Nights are really night and rain feels like that kind of rain that makes you want to sleep. I love it.
---
I like your theory about 20 strong players + 20 monkeys, but I don’t agree. 
---
Those monkeys will inevitably overpull, fail to CC, pull aggro, etc. 
---
It’s honestly easier to clear with 25 than it is to clear with 25 + 15 idiots standing in the fire
---
Devil's advocate.
---
If you want people to stay grouped up and help you finish.
---
Be nice.
---
I bailed on someone that showed up to the group to quest 15 mins after we started because they were selling stuff and crafting.
---
Then they kept asking to be friends on discord.  Then sent bnet friend requests all the while talking about how they could solo this quest as a paladin.
---
We finished 80% of the quest before they even arrived despite getting an invite at the same time and being in the same place.
---
World first? How? Did I end up in a delorean?
---
I've been grouping with warriors that use blood rage at the start of every pull with multiple mobs (decreases healing by 50%). Tanks who shoot individual mobs and end up with entire packs instead of body pulling.
---
I think some adjustment will be required on those players' part. And odds are we'll end up with some morons in our raids.
---
40 dedicated skilled players clearing a raid in the first week doesn't mean everyone will face roll.
---
We'll see though, maybe I'm wrong.
---
How do you have 300g........?
---
SnD is ass until level 2 and not worth using
---
Corrupt cops turning a blind eye. Somebody probably bribed the goblins.
---
Its a lot faster to do that outside WC. Run WC once then wrap it up outside WC.
---
"private servers aren't harder" people on suicide watch
---
best buddy is a type B. i try to be type A as much as possible and it's a nightmare to group with him to do ANYTHING :D
---
They were the most hardcore players in the world, most of them only slept 6 hours a day before logging right back on to continue the grind, you shouldn't use them as a basis of comparison.
---
I said literally nothing regarding the op. Go get angry and write a book at somebody else's post.
---
You mean private classic Wow server?
---
I picked Mograine because it was a Medium pop server when I started. Almost all others were at high-full. 
---
Are the queues here to stay?
---
I was wrong
---
It might be an addon, but I'm not sure which. When I open key bindings, I just have a section named "Target Markers" where I've set a few marks to some keys.
---
OmniCC?
---
Laughs in Ghost Wolf
---
I saw that on Incendius and facepalmed. It’s a learning experience for people who have never played classic of TBC and don’t understand the way tanking works compared to retail.
---
To be fair, dungeon XP is broken. I am almost confident in vanilla you weren't even able to enter SM or ZF as a raid, and by entering a raid, all XP gained got a huge penalty.
---
The leveling time to 60 was 95% of the race, and if dungeon grinding wasn't viable, the first week timer would have been extremely hard to hit. Even with this guild going 18 hours a day having years and years of experience, they still had to go in with 15 non 60s despite how broken dungeon farming is.
---
I mean, its just tribalism from both sides. Theres always gonna be bad eggs. A lot of top comments in this sub have people shitting on retail players for being lazy or whatever, with phrases like "weed out the weak" and likewise being commonly used. Likewise, the WoW subreddit has a lot of people shitting on Classic for being boring as sin or too much of a timesink.
---
The thing to realise is that neither game is inherently better, theyre just very different and thus cater to different audiences. Arguing with someone that your opinion is better than theirs is just dumb and pointless. 
---
The great thing is we can now choose what we want!
---
Save it for a while. There isn't enough gold on servers yet for it to have value.
---
lol I doubt that
---
3 manned from i remember, priest warrior and hunter.
---
Where is that sword from btw?
---
yikes
---
Just use unstuck feature in the help tab
---
Clique and Grid are all you need
---
I wrote 2 lines and copied the post you didn't even bother to read.
---
Oh ya got it :) so good for a 33 warr
---
You’re wrong.
---
World 1263626374? Games been out 15 years lol.
---
As a former warrior i feel indentified.
---
I got 3 in my guild that for Fortnite kiddies and love this game. All born after this game was released.
---
should not have looked at this while im at work might have laughed a little too loud
---
Except for the fact that it’s 100% TBC gear? That’s T4 warrior set and the weapon is Kong’s Defender from Karazhan chess game. Shield is just from dungeons
---
Just gotta start with Immolate!
---
You're a moron.
---
You got that backwards.
---
Wrath, Wrath, Moonfire. Because of the travel time you can get two Wraths in before the mob starts running at you. Sometimes three, but then you run out of mana so I usually stick with two.
---
Ashkandi
---
Thats the only way I managed to play so far.
---
Is that a pussy cat by the river?
---
They fell and broke their skull
---
I'm not lying and never watched a vid. 
---
And the part about majordomo was from Apes clear not mine.
---
&gt;a hardcore guild that has been playing on private servers for half a decade cleared MC and Onyxia using an optimized raid composition with no memespecs  
---
&gt;therefore memespecs are viable
---
Honestly, a plethora of things. And if I happen to open with wrath, moonfire etc., go into cat and later need heals, I usually don't even have enough mana to cast cat form again.
---
You can't even blame the Alliance or act like they did some super horrible thing by treating the Forsaken like shit. They literally just had they entire upper portion of the Eastern Kingdoms fucking decimated by the Scourge and Plague, and lost all of Lordaeron and so much more.
---
Plus, why would they even trust the Forsaken? They trusted Arthas, and their amazing, lovable, perfect Prince, was the one who came through and destroyed everything. It makes perfect sense they wouldn't trust the Forsaken.
---
TLDR: Alliance reacted accordingly to the Forsaken after Arthas already played them like a fiddle and destroyed so much, Frosaken proceed to play into the evil the Alliance suspected by happily using plagues, blight, and the blood of innocents.
---
whoa hold up there, i'm not just some random person, i am the future fucking highlord!
---
That is a truly moronic statement.
---
Capture a new pet with Rank 3 and then being out your desired pet again and open “Beast Training” from the general tab in your spell book to train your new ability.
---
Did you google it? Not being shitty that's just all I did and got results, are they just not applicable to you currently?
---
A lot of macros are to streamline any clicking, targeting, stopping, attacking, etc. into key presses such that they do extra 'stuff' you want to be doing - with the exception of abusing the global cooldowns so for example if you were an orc warlock, you might have a macro set up to use your racial ability, your trinkets or items with cooldowns, then start casting shadow bolt. Or you might put /stopcasting into something so that you can fear right away rather than waiting to finish channeling. or you might /startattacking (I actually forget if you need a different command for wands or not, but you get the idea) into some of your spells so that when you start combat, you don't stand around like a dingus between casts.
---
Hope that helps.
---
&gt;we aren't talking about BFA tho
---
Aren't we?
---
The comment EvroRS replied to only said "Best raiding guild in the world", not CLASSIC raiding and then even compared it to the olympics.
---
Also Apes are extremely strong as a guild to level, attune and prepare super quickly in vanilla, and at the raids as well for sure. But get 40 players from a top tier mythic raiding guild and throw them at MC and they'll probably clear it just as fast if we ignore the leveling etc, which is ***not part of raiding*** . 
---
Sure its part of the race for the raid, even the most important part, but its not *raiding*.
---
 Method aren't speedrunners, Apes are.
---
Blackwing Lair
---
Really any of them that you can equip and have stats on them.  Avoid weapons that only have procs or high damage, you need to hit with the melee weapon to benefit from those at all.
---
The game was developed by ZeniMax Online Studios, not Bethesda. All Bethesda did was publish it.
---
level 10 and already bored with wow
---
Im not sure but im not willing to abandon one of the most balanced EU PVP servers. It is a miracle to be on one as alliance...
---
Oh nice! Didn’t think about that
---
I was thinking of asking my own question, but since this thread already exists, I’ll ask here:
---
I’m going for a 2h Fury/Arms warrior, but I want to be able to tank dungeons because they’re in such high demand (every local chat seems filled with “LFM tank RFC/WC/SFK then G2G!”)
---
I’ve already realized that tanking doesn’t mean just go for it with your two-hander, that you need to keep sword and board around for it.
---
But I’m trying to save money for expensive things, mount eventually and maybe polearm weapon skill. Is it okay for me to skip buying most of the protection skills at the class trainer? But still tank dungeons? I’ve done fine tanking RFC with just taunt, sunder armor, and revenge. Can I stick with that into higher level content, or do I just need to pony up the cash for all the skills?
---
UHHH AUUGHH
---
Ah sorry, I didn't know that there was people looking at the world first on other bosses than the last one. FYI, counting the world first on the first bosses is stupid because they're released earlier in US due to time zone and they're no way as hard as the last one. If we're looking at the last bosses of the raid since MoP, Method has 12 world first on 17 raids, so I'll say it again, Method has no real competitor for world firsts since MoP
---
clique and elvui is all you need

---
Method are the ones pushing the "race to world first classic" agenda. They lost because they are the ones that made it matter.
---
Haven't been able to play yet myself, but have all week to go supernerd.
---
Guess I'll see for myself.
---
Wait a minute, are you seriously trying to judge the difficulty of something by how people who don't know how to play the game clear it?
---
Like by that logic some piss easy walking simulator is the hardest game ever because one person doesn't know how to press x on their controller on the start screen to play it lol.
---
It's far more objective to judge content by how good players clear it than retarded players.
---
You're correct. I've edited my comment.
---
I always loved that wow made me feel like I was playing an mmo inside Warcraft 3. Retail doesn’t have that charm at all
---
laughs in free mount at 40 that's way faster than your cheeto
---
It’s like they all have no lives or something.
---
Ya it's pretty ridiculous. I kinda... Just wanna play the game.. Do FIVE man's while leveling up..
---
He's obviously wrong. Eight extra slots is eight nightfall procs for one.
---
the worst grind so far for me has been in the barrens with the raptor heads and harpy rings
---
Those were live players for the most part. Anyone that touched or followed the private server scene knew otherwise.
---
I saw it referred to that way on Balnazar back in the day.
---
So it's legit the old graphics too? This intrigues me. But I know my wife would murder me if I played WoW again and sunk into the time sink again.
---
What? In right to work states ypu can terminate anyone anytime without any reason.
---
You know WoW is divided into different servers, right? Some used VC, some used DM. There’s no rewriting of history going on here, just a struggle between people from different servers trying to get their old lingo established as the de facto.
---
Oh I remember the mats cost being the least of the problems! That quest was a bitch
---
Have you killed them too?
---
That's why I said other than the true players who can enjoy the game.... I myself don't care. I'm worried that people will be turned away on how easy it was for people to accomplish these things.
---
If you hover over the stats in the character screen you can see the difference. That little bit of armor is probably only a .5-1% damage reduction so it's not really worth it for the extra crit chance.
---
Don't open with wrath once you have cat form.  Get spirit gear.
---
No problem.  happy fishing friend :)
---
I've never played WoW but I'm thinking about starting on Classic. I've already decided I want to be a Dwarf Priest, but which primary professions should I choose? I'll be playing PvE and am looking for something that works well in group raids but is also decent at solo stuff. I've read a bunch of guides and they're recommending Herbalism and Alchemy, is that a good combo or should I go for something else?
---
Anyone that says it's not DM should be instantly put on ignore
---
I should have stayed on BFA tbh. People there don't have the stick up the bum there.
---
That tweet was made the 21th ffs
---
Yeah, it was a huge upgrade.  I equipped it straight away!
---
Laughs in I will never, ever have the money to buy anything
---
It’s pretty cool! Been a blast playing this week.
---
Pretty new! It’s exciting. And haha pvp is fun. Especially when you think you’re safe in barrens. But get attacked by the night elf regardless.
---
I play for fun myself. 
---
Same as I enjoy basketball even though I’m not in the NBA. 
---
Don’t let other people on a totally different level than 99% of us normies haha.
---
Exactly. "Retail sucks!" People usually havent played since like wotlk. Bfa sucks, sure, but legion didn't.
---
You can blame the streamers for this mess. You could enter instances as a raid during Vanilla, the only difference is people didn't do it.
---
But now that some streamers did it everyone is all "ZOMG we must do it as well and it's the only way to level".
---
Okay I'm happy for you I didn't say everyone that uses vc complains I said everyone that complains uses vc.
---
Having flightpaths just about everywhere is nice though.
---
Yeah you are ffed badly, good luck doing anything phase 2.
---
i wont be using heroic strike? what do i use instead?
---
I like that the raids are easy.  I hate having to sit helpful people that just can't do stuff good or learn to do other stuff good as well.
---
If they were serious they would have practiced on a private server. They couldn't stream that so they didn't.
---
MC was still considerably harder than it is now.
---
Welcome to WoW, bucko!
---
It's under Orgrimmar. Through the Cleft of Shadows.
---
I've learned you can ask for about 5s per stack at around level 20 and usually have it work out.
---
Nice.
---
Wait, I thought TipsOut or Asmongold was gonna be world first.
---
🦀🦀Isn't this a Runescape thing?🦀🦀
---
Sure, if they can hold threat it's all fine, if it works it works, but this was basically not having a tank, if I'm honest. All mobs wanted to kill the healer at all times and were never pulled off. It was chill and we made it work, but it was basically 4dps and a priest.
---
Wonder how many people are gonna try meme about this tweet without reading the date.
---
This isn't surprising to hear with so few of their main PvE squad there, but they've definitely said stuff on stream to contradict this which is just view bait I guess.
---
No no no! You see we’re just using the blood of the innocent we got from those mages.
---
I mean the fact that they killed Rag many times is not really relevant, no one who raids mythic in retail is going to have a problem with Rag, or any other Classic boss.  The mechanics are a joke compared to retail, especially with modern UIs/weakauras. 
---
The hard part was leveling that quickly, which is a crazy feat that they have that many people rehearsed and dedicated enough to hit 56+ already.  Killing Rag and Ony was just the victory lap really.  I'm sure Method and any other streamers will 1 shot Rag too once they get there, without "years of private server practice killing rag".
---
Political memes and classic wow? That's an upvote.
---
Yeah but it's a different adventure. I chose a different class.
---
Hi,
---
We will start classic mid September and are not sure what to play. 
---
Background: I am a bit experienced as I played Pally for like a year back in the old vanilla days but can’t really remember a lot. Also, both of us are casual players and won’t have time for a lot of 40 man raids of rank 14.
---
My friend wants to play Shaman. I want to play either Mage, Rogue, Warlock or Hunter. I have 2 questions:
---
1) which of these classes fits Shaman for duo play, i.e. Duo leveling and at lvl 60 mostly pve (5 man dungeons, maybe once in a while mc or something if we find a casual guild) but also a bit pvp. Not interested in warrior though. Does rogue benefit from WF totems? And especially for pvp it would be interesting to hear your opinion on a good combination with the shaman.
---
2) which of these classes is the “most” fun to play at 60? I heard mage and Lock are just pressing one button in pve... so with “fun” I mean an interesting rotation or play style. Rogue seems attracting due to mechanical skills such as fore stabbing, etc. and seems hard to master. Warlock also sounds cool but the shard farming may be a bit boring. Or isn’t this a problem at 60?
---
I hope you can help me with this. I watched a lot of videos lately but none of them could help me and answer my questions.
---
Best
---
Don
---
Dude method cares about money and viewers. They couldnt stream private servers so they didn't practice.
---
People really should swap servers. I swapped over from Shazzrah and I check out the queue whenever I log in, often still over 10k queues. Never had a queue on my new server its fantastic.
---
Sadly they were too hard for majority of players that were used to wrath heroics ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don’t know why people gets asshurt by this and says that classic wont last? What does it matter if one single hardcore guild decides to rush? They are the ones who’ll be out of content not you. You worry about getting to level 60 first.
---
High IQ move
---
Classic is about as easy as the kronos servers, people quit those because they were boring and undertuned. Let's think what this means for classic.
---
*sigh*... SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE
---
#NoChanges
---
^^^^^^/s
---
What do you mean by drive-by buffs? Also can you play as the new races and classes?
---
You need to stop worrying so much about how everyone else enjoys something. it deosn't stop you from enjoying it in the way you want in any way.
---
Plays character on stream, makes millions.  Seems like it's working.
---
I tried but as a druid, I use almost everything in dungeons or in world PvP. I've only been able to skip Wrath &amp; Starfire.
---
Same. Although obviously every server has its own culture. 
---
This debate in the end is sort of silly. As long as people get the end message and a group is formed, who cares what it’s called.
---

if you werent aware of this site
---
Middle of the left continent. Do you have somewhere more pleasant to be? I’ve got either dessert wasteland or a forest full of friendly zombies haha. I want something that looks more like mulgore. So beautiful. But it’s too low level.
---
Do not rush. You will regret it.
---
&gt; I personally love going to the gym 
---
Maybe you hit the nail on the head right there. You love going to the gym. Many people don't. Maybe these guys just love playing vanilla over and over again. Sure, you could argue your thing makes more sense than their thing but we're not really talking about how sensible things are. People just enjoy different things.
---
Yeah I'm def a type B. I've been playing a mage and I'm still under level 10. 😅
---
These guys and myself included were farming mc and bwl weekly for years before LH and Nost were around. That's when p servers got big. It adds even more to the no-lifeness but this stuff is so we'll known to these players I'm surprised they didn't try to all go in before 60 to make it more of a challenge.
---
Personally for me, Tauren starting area was hell
---
It really really makes me appreciate tbc. As an elem shaman into t5 I could feel the "sum of its parts" vibe when the warlocks and mages in my group itemized so they would be missing like 4 percent hit if they didn't have me in the group with them (draenei and totem).
---
Enhancement not only actually existed, but sterted to scale pretty nicely. Elem was hot at the first half of tbc it felt like, until enh scaling out sped elem, and that's without considering enh had totem twisting agi and windfury and a basically perpetual attack power buff to their party.
---
In vanilla raids they have nothing.
---
I see that you are just saying it. My point here is that we would be better off if people didn't just say say things. If people actually engaged their brains before their mouths. But yes, you did just say it. Feel better?
---
Yeah, and if it works it works, but what I meant in my post was that he basically wasn't 'tanking', if you know what I mean? It never felt like we had a tank at any point, but we got through it with CC and AOE, taking things carefully and me running in circles with the mobs chasing me (as healer).
---
Which also makes playing on it a really strange experience due to the layering - you're aware that the world is constantly full but, at least in undead newbie land, I rarely see more than ten people at a time even in the Undercity.
---
Classic gud, retail bad, unless you are good at classic then get fucked stinky nerd.
---
Great logic here. Only play how I play and enjoy how I enjoy because that's the true spirit of classic.
---
I never played on a pserver and it was obvious to me. But I also actually raided MC in vanilla and knew that it wasn't exactly hard.
---
Thanks!
---
You might want to check the date on that tweet, you look pretty ignorant right now.
---
The servers are all bigger than the biggest vanilla servers
---
And you need the DPS to be on board.
---
I've had a sub near continuously for the past 11 years, and outside of delaying mythic raids by 1 week, I have never seen a single person defend the use of bullshit timegating, it's a system hated across the entire community. Patch 7.2 was one of the best examples of this.
---
Nope, and I plan too. Just worried that hype will die to fast. But it won't for me and my friends. Just sad it happened so fast.
---
Im just looking for the “You could just screenshot” comment
---
Good idea. I’ll go to zombie forest for a little bit.
---
Undercity NPCs in Arugal have been down for half the day.
---
But these conditions also apply to everyone. Your argument is valid in terms of an individual or a small group rushing to 60 but not whole guilds. This might also happen during the introduction of other phases. Then we can start blaming luck on rolls, spawns of mats etc.
---
Level 20 tho
---
Exactly it’s basically use your eyeballs and you’ll do fine.
---
As I replied to someone else, this is far from my first chat offense. Although it was my first on classic.  
---
Enough people reported me for racism and I did message blizz. They probably will not restore my chat tho since I used to get reported regularly by my alliance teammates for swearing in battlegrounds. And just swearing openly, not directed at someone. I just need to find a game with less children online.
---
I was type A in actual classic... this time around I am definitely type B!
---
Same. I honestly feel bad for people on super high pop servers who still have login queues.  Atiesh has a moderate amount of people but I have yet to see a login queue even on the weekend. Hopes that you guys on full realms get population boosts!
---
"World first" 200 times later. Such a joke
---
I think Taco Bell would live.
---
Yes, but only for a short amount of time. Things can go wrong. 😂
---
More of a hardware question, mouse seems to get crazy acceleration sometimes for no reason at all and it completely turns me around. Anyone know the cause and or a fix? Seen some say it's an addon problem but the only addon I have is questie.
---
I'd argue that with mana pots and demonic runes going oom isn't really the problem. Especially if a boss does get killed in like 2 minutes or less.
---
What world firsts did they cover exactly?  Not level 60, not first raids...
---
tell that to people who play chess
---
Can someone please explain what this is to me? I used to play WoW back in the day but I was a noob and didn’t get very far. I have no clue what this is or what the hype around it is. The comments just make me more confused. Can someone help me out? Because this seems cool and I really want to know so I can be hype about it too lmao
---
How does hardcore guild like APES with ton of experience from private servers affect the experience for you?
---
This doesn't make sense. Did your guild got level 60, killed rag and onyx? I bet it will take you guild 1 months to do what APES did. Even a pro guild like Method hasn't done rag and onyx yet. 
---
How does the accomplishment of APES on a different affect your own personal gameplay?
---
This is stupid. When a random person from China beat Zelda, does make you want to quit Zelda?
---
20 Undead Mage with almost 150 fishing/cooking
---
14 Human Warrior, got to start fishing and cooking
---
I play with and without friends. I think it is important to take your time and meet people, not grind to Max level as fast as possible. If you do, the game might not last very long for you, and that's okay; there are a lot of us that will still enjoy it at our own paces.
---
It actually changed a shit load right before BWL hit with 1.6.  Epics didn't see much change, but blues and greens had their stats boosted and the frequency upped prior to 1.6.
---
The only salty people are Method and retail fans who thought that private server players wouldn't have a chance against the elite retail players. Oh, and Asmongold.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Apes will clear BWL in 30-40minutes of release.
---
You first ....
---
Considering there are so many players online, does that mean the nodes of various resources spawn quicker as well?
---
&gt;I know, but those raids aren't exactly much of a feat, are they? 
---
So when are you going to admit they're better then? Because about any raid in Vanilla is going to be easy to these guys.
---
I mean just because you're at war with someone doesn't mean you have to fight battles that you're clearly gonna lose. I spent all last night ganking alliance. Just sitting in stealth waiting for a mage to run out of mana and have to drink, then 2 shot him. 
---
Or i wait for people to pull mobs then engage.
---
Only pick battles you think you can win. I must've killed like 20 and died maybe 3 times.
---
Druid ftw
---
Herbalism/alchemy is possibly the best profession combination between the excellent consumables you can make for your raid and the money you can make off of transmutes. 
---
Many priests go tailoring/enchanting. Tailoring will help you have good gear and plenty of bags while leveling up, and you can disenchant the green gear you make as you go to help level enchanting. Tailoring also makes a preraid best in slot for priests. Fair warning: this combination is expensive to level up, which can be mitigated if your guild is willing to send you cloth/greens to DE.
---
Can you still fall under stormwind?
---
Nothing. The majority of quests are about winning their battles at any cost though. They've left humanity behind, death itself obviously means something very different to them, and in that context, a lot of the things that players find abhorrent about them actually become kind of interesting. I don't remember that particular quest but I do find it surprising that they would have no objections to enslavement, and there are other examples of that too.
---
I just do it out of habit in cities so that I remember to do it out in the wild, too.
---
I got a bfd group together, which for alliance is a lot of work. Clearing the cultists one ran off but didn't pull adds...but he also never came back. Tank and I were stuck in combat with everyone else dead. Pulling for the second to last room got ugly and we wiped. Then we realized after a couple of pulls our dps was just too low for the last boss.
---
Everyone was cool about it. It was fantastic.
---
I use vendor price and auctionator.  I don’t think auctioneer itself has a classic version yet but auctionator is very similar.
---
&gt; The debate is stupid because both are technically correct and also wrong at the same time.
---
What's correct about calling a whole dungeon after the last boss? Never have I seen somebody refer to a dungeon by saying the name of the end boss. "Yo, guys, let's make Illidan!"
---
If it's a 1 boss raid, then that's fine, but otherwise it doesn't make sense. Not even ToV was called "Helya" and that thing only had 3 bosses.
---
Aso how do i get those mining bonuses
---
I would be on that boat...except my wife is alrdy sick of me playing...so ill do 30 to 60 slow and just pvp and rarely raid lol
---
Nope, just have morals and a sense of human empathy leading to an understanding that a small handful can not have everything without everyone else suffering (like with capitalism).
---
There are no battlegrounds for a while, probably 6 months if I was to guess, the only PvP will be out in the world.
---
Welcome! Things only get better once you're level 20+ and start leveling in contested zones 😁
---
Does sweeping strikes and cleave synergize?
---
Honestly the RNG needs a tune. If your sitting here thinking that how long it takes to "grind" is to your benefit or the classic experience, you're a fool. The game is literally designed that way to keep you paying Blizzard those fat stacks you earn. 
---
I've played classic when it was vanilla. It was cool then, but I was 15. I got shit to do now. Im not asking for anything major. Just don't vcd think I should spend an hour grinding 4 items.
---
They were wearing greens and didn't even have a full group when the killed ony. At 40% health they had 14 people alive and they still killed it. Memespecs are easily viable when content is this easy.
---
Limit was increased from 8 to 16 during classic but wasn’t removed completely until later.
---
Yeah my stoneform is broken for rogue tanking.
---
&gt; Me and my friend tried to log in at the time. He had a character he got in in like 1min.
---
Lol your friend did not get in after 1 minute while you were stuck waiting for 2 hours+
---
Forsaken? Absolutely.
---
Warrior tanking early on really is awful. But it's not too big a deal because deadmines and BFD and stocks are relatively easy and it doesn't matter if dps pull a few adds.
---
It is frustrating that when you miss your first auto, mob parries your second, then they dodge your third..now you've got no rage, dps has already unloaded, and you've got mobs running everywhere with taunt on a 10second CD AND its melee range. A lot of people forget that.
---
Some dps dont understand the struggle of the low level warrior. We live and die by the auto attack and constantly being at less than 20 range. Its rough but it gets better.
---
Imagine realising that they had massive viewer counts and made a lot of money doing this, while having fun, enjoying their hobby and socialising.
---
Getsie, that name sound wrong said in hungarian
---
Of course they are getting payed for it. But the casters mentioning them participating in a world first race every 5 minutes and even after rag was down they still only had 1 level 60 they said "but the race for onyxia world first is still going" as if they would have even the slightest chance. I guess in the end they just weren't speed levelers and didn't have much preparation. I think they went in there mostly blind and just figured farming dungeons will be quick enough.
---
Actually anonymity has been proven numerous times over to be a strong inebriator for Bullying and reckless behaviors.
---
Meanwhile having a modern passport or international police databases means accountability. Leading to - in this case - a stronger sense of community where bad seeds can be identified and put aside. 
---
Just you try to Ninja a big guild in a raid, it will feel just like evading the fiscs with no whatsoever knowledge about their laws.
---
In a IRL context Retail is more akin to the whole modern internet anonymity problems, while Classic is basically our world in the 80’s. Some people will not understand the attraction of going back, some people never left, but now we have a choice.
---
My point being that while you’re raising an important point of today’s gaming scene, I believe that as the new server’s communities get older and tighter, we’ll be better equipped for the few aggressive players leaking in.
---
*Mic drops* 
---
Cheers

So let them have their fun. They made a lot of money on the streams.

---
Great. Blizzard did an update that helped with queue times significantly. I didn’t have a queue
---
I like the idea of tanking, but it seems a lot more involved here. How do I hold on to threat when I don't really have any abilities that generate it? I can hit things, but wouldn't a Warrior do that better, for example?
---
And i'm lvl 12 with 20silver. *oh no...*
---
Keep in mind, leveling is fastet as retribution, but you can easily heal with full retribution spec. To heal easily i would recommend to go into interface options, open the raid frame pane and top right set to use raid frames in party.
---
Check the show class colors, display power bars etc. Adjust them to your liking. Its easiest if you invite someone when setting this up.
---
Once raid frames are set, you can heal all dungeons til 60 as ret
---
Same but being a very casual player there will always be areas to explore and achievements and such...
---
I played in 2004 on Dalvengyr. It was called god damned VC then. Don't even know why there's an argument. Anyone saying otherwise either had a different experience on a different server or came late to the party. Either way, it doesn't matter. It was originally called VC, so there. The end.
---
Install it and try?
---
If I remember correctly, tipsout was called out for being a complete dick in the discord, and his guild crumbled...  so , they WERE going for world first, till everyone learned about Tipsout and his ways, then they abandoned him lmfao
---
As a paladin your strongest role is as a healer. So even if you’re speced for something else for leveling it’s always good to keep some healing gear in your bags (+intellect? I’m not 100% sure what’s best I’ve never played a healer). 
---
[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/threat-overview-classic-wow) probably does a better job explaining threat and aggro than I can. 
---
Paladins can also take on damage dealing (or “DPS”) and tanking roles. DPS is pretty straightforward. It’s not a strength of yours but you won’t be useless. As far as I’m aware they are viable tanks until you get to end game raids/dungeons but it’s fairly tricky, so as someone new to the game you may want to read some pally tank guides before you jump in head first.
---
Would have made things a lot better a lot faster if your ISPs hadn't literally *stolen* billions of taxpayer money with the promise of upgrading the nation's internet infrastructure and then just... did nothing.
---
Absolutely, I've been playing on my acer swift 5 and it runs great even with an i5 and no gpu
---
And you can teleport in and out, vendor repairs dummies etc.
---
What addon would be good for druids energy bar ticks?
---
I really hope people start to understand that the OSRS route presents so many opportunities for the game. It would be a shame to just go through every expansion release again.
---
Depends on the server. I'm on westfall and it's stayed at high but let me in every time. I suspect ones like faerlia (or whatever) will still have 1hr+ queues
---
Meth isn't really a thing in Europe.. it isn't in supply. 
---
If people are doing drugs in Europe its weed/cocaine/mdma/hallucinogens
---
Yes in a later phase
---
Check this sub back when classic was first announced. Also, check this thread, there’s a ton of people saying the exact same thing as me. There were a lot of people claiming vanilla raiding was hard. 
---
There’s also that guy Kungen (I think that’s his name) that made an extremely popular video claiming that naxx40 was the hardest raid of all time.
---
Swedes suck in general...
---
I raided in MC before BWL was out. It missed a lot.
---
A druid has been amazing for everything I've been doing. Groups have been so fun. Questing is fun. I can do anything.
---
Nice name
---
I just got 40 only doing dungeons once for quests.
---
Don’t worry what other people are doing, if you’re having fun you’re doing fine.
---
Just dont go to a full pop server and you'll be fine. You dont have to play with a streamer to love this game
---
Coming from someone who started as a 7 year old in Burning Crusade, is there a significant difference between the Drums of War patch we're playing and 2004 classic?
---
God I love shamans.
---
Yes you can’t define fun really. It’s a personal thing. And you can’t really tell people shouldn’t be enjoying what they like.
---
Most likely down the line.  It came with 1.7.
---
See THIS is how classic should be played XD
---
not gonna lie even after turning it off, I still have to squint.
---
Good. My wife was wondering about that. Is there a place on the forums where they list what they’re releasing and in which phase?
---
A good tank will turn the mob so its back is facing the group so you dont need to go all the way around.  Could be you've just been unlucky!
---
Switched from whitemane to benediction and never looked back.
---
What gpu does it have? When I’m traveling I play on a celeron with an intel 620 and it does okay. Not the best but very playable

How are you a true player?

Because you've done more of the content (obviously havent)?

Have you done more quests (nope)?

Done more profession leveling? (Probably not)

Seen more of the zones than them (doubt it)?
---
Explored more? (They've been exploring on pservers for years unlike you)

Just curious...  you're saying that you, a casual gamer, are more a true player... than a group of people who have been playing it for years and are pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in the game?

True. Although in the Horde side it's "all your leaders are idiots you don't agree with". It's like real life.

Boss turns around and starts killing the Druid that put a Rejuv on you, or the Paladin that buffed after the pull.
---
It's honestly just not worth it, one PW:S isn't going to make or break the fight, and it just makes the Warrior's life unnecessarily harder.
---
The teleport are just quality of life spells on my opinion. And you can only get IF and SW at 20. I prioritize stuff I actually need (like main attack spell) vs stuff that isn't necessary (looking at you detect magic). Struggle is real.

Until you get NF. I love NF.

If you need a reward to play a game, then maybe you shouldn't play games. You probably don't actually enjoy them.

I raid for the challenge, and the satisfaction of killing hard mythic bosses. The loot/progression is just a means to that end.

Leveling is shit and one of the worst experiences there is.

The only game worth playing is at 60 with riads, pvp, and dungeons.

I needed 3 bear meat in loch Modan, I massacred the entire bear population. I think they were having an overpopulation problem so none of them were getting enough meat on their bones for me to get any. Once I kill about 30+ the bear meat started dropping. XD
---
Yes that actually happened. Also my queue just progressively went up a little by little for hours on end.
---
The barrens chat is so damn toxic on my server I have to ignore it for my own sanity’s sake. Everything else you mentioned though is great.
---
All my money is gone
---
I think it depends of the quest. If I'm willing to share mob kills on the last 8 Razormen I don't really see why I need to stay to help them kill the 13 Waterseekers I already did when it's not a difficult quest and we mostly grouped for temporary convenience.
---
I stick around more if a) the quest is hard b) the other person is a warrior or seems new.
---
It's just way more obvious than the people using auto key macros or programs.
---
I think people are more shocked not that the fight itself was easy, but that they did it with a ton of people not even level 60 and wearing a bunch of greens. Its clear that people recruiting for content must have had unrealistic standards back in the day.
---
You sound like a Hillary supporter
---
I don’t understand the problem with this. It doesn’t affect anyone else. Some people are always going to find ways to optimize games, it’s what they enjoy doing and that’s great.
---
Righteous fury and consecration...anything to help add holy damage as well with judgements
---
Ember stone Staff is Bae
---
I hope people like you begin to understand that classic plus would actually be amazing. If we stick to the original design philosophy, we have a chance to see the creation of a game better than vanilla in 2005.
---
Oh, and they lost the Rag race too btw
---
Method lost to a bald gnome and then to a bunch of apes, its over gents
---
Alright thanks, gonna hold on to it then.
---
&gt;sorry  
---
yes you are, lil biatch
---
I need to finish a Kaizen project this week. Guess who is calling sick to play wow all day this week
---
*yawn*
---
I know she has other uses, just take her to the nearest tavern, and rent a room for the night
---
Youre a fucking moron. How many of methods retail team do you see playing classic as part of this 'race'? They said its a celebration event and named it world to first race as part of their world to race first event from retail.
---
If these pserver guilds are so good and think they're better than method, they should race in retail where bosses have more than 2 mechanics and rotations aren't 1 spell spam. Oh wait, these guys wouldn't even be top 50
---
Well since MC has already been cleared that last part at least is self evident, I must admit though I dont ever remember there being 10 man SM groups back when I played classic. Could have just passed me by though.
---
Usually type A, but going full type B in Classic. Still sub level 10 😅
---
HealComm and Five Second Rule are probably the most important. Use default Blizzard raid frames in parties, too and make sure to configure the options you like in options - class colors, power bars, show cleansable debuffs, etc.
---
Ah the good ol entitlement children of today.  "You owe me everything and I am not responsible for anything". 
---
Good luck then, consider going on being a shining example of stupidity.
---
I mean, that lvl 28 horde player who killed a lvl 20 me in Ashenvale sorted started my war against the horde, not to mention all the horde players are red.
---
I mean if Horde don't think we're at war then fine, will be a lot easier for me.
---
LEAVE!!!! LESS QUEUE. TYVM
---
You've explained exactly the problem with paladin tanking at that level. I would recommend against it. If you would like to tank, you should at least spend some points to get consecrate, otherwise holding threat on multiple mobs will be near impossible.
---
I really doubt anyone is getting locked out if you do cath + armory before resetting.
---
Well good thing TD didn't pick up because it's used for Tol Dagor now.
---
[Hickory Pipe]
---
I lol'd
---
This. It seems like when you group up whether it’s layers or what— it’s like the game doesn’t know how to handle the RNG and the spawn rate for stuff. I don’t mind grinding for drops. It’s classic. I don’t want to be getting a guaranteed drop every kill. But I feel like mobs pop in large groups all at once. And then when I group it’s like I get ZERO drops. My group mates get finished with the quest. It was never perfect but I assumed I’d get one while they got 10. 
---
Oh well. Still loving it.
---
The quest says to give head...
---
Edit: Oh, GET heads.  Silly mistake.
---
Does anyone have some tape? We need to put some tape over that button.
---
Keypad / toggles between walk and run, you can rebind it to whatever you want. Default speed is run so pressing / slows you down to a walk. Mostly useful for escort quests when you don’t want to leave them behind.
---
whoa.. really? Why not?.. pvp is the only reason I'm playing. what is the only viable option atm? just pvp worlds?
---
Just because you can't afford the mounts doesn't make them a poor business decision. Game studios of any genre make a killing on microtransactions. They are, and always were, a great business decision. Whether they are good for the game is another argument.
---
&gt;Blizzard just banking millions off 15 year old content  
---
that's the point  
---
no need to circlejerk about something when we know all its faults
---
It depends on the population of your server and what class you play. For warriors and healers it should be easy but for rogues, hunters and maybe warlocks it might be hard if your server turns low pop in a few months.
---
Auto banned for over a month based on community reports that they said would be checked ?
---
X to doubt
---
You think everyone going gnome and dwarf is optimal? All those gnome rogues and warrior changed to humans would be optimized. They memed on everyone with this.
---
It took until BC for me to make my pocket healer into my wife. :-P
---
Holy is probably the slowest to level unless you have a mage buddy to aoe grind with.
---
Smite spec is almost as good as shadow.
---
Where are all those Rich end game player buying my copper stacks for 20 gold...
---
My brother and I killed a level 23 priest yesterday in Ashenvale. We're both lvl 15. It was exhilarating. I used to run a competitive WSG league on Tichondrius in vanilla. I missed pvp. Can't wait till battlegrounds start!
---
The vast majority of people are still going to level normally. They’re still going to challenged in MC just like casual guilds were on private servers. 
---
This doesn’t affect the health of the game at all.
---
There wasn't because there wasn't this sort of leveling frenzy. Finding 10 mages in vanilla... but this isn't vanilla people have been playing for decades, ofcourse there will be cheese strats.
---
They covered Jokerd\`s progress aswell as some others who where high level at that point. Just like with the raid race they probably had no deals with these other streamers (allowed to show/restream their pov). APES didn't stream at all if I read that correctly, but they covered that also.
---
Yeah, they're concerned with autistically competing in a 15 year old easy game that nobody else cares about. This is like a 5th league football team is proud of being first in that league, and shit talks real Madrid because Real Madrid didn't win that 5th league
---
Amen my friend and I got lost in a cave in Teldrassil for 2 hours? We farmed up just about two levels trying to find the items we needed before hearthing out XD
---
Everyone, including me who played since release AND WAS PART OF IT..
---
dude wtf
---
When a priest runs by and buffs you but you're a shaman so all you can do is target them and emote something, because  even though you have 13 buffs to keep track of, they are only applicable to you .\_.
---
They are literally the "best" guild in classic as of now and you think what they are able to so can be replicated by a bunch of noobs standing in fire? 
---
For 99% of the players this will not be their experience.
---
That would take the kind of emotional maturity that the standard kind of person who argues politics on the internet does not have.
---
Does this work with classic and or retail in their present state?
---
Is that relevant?
---
Don't play retail = don't play retail
---
I'm sorry, it's not impressive, at all. The raid is incredibly easy, everything you said is a time sink with zero skill required. 
---
I'm more impressed with people that have a balanced life with their friends and family than this.
---
I can see why you were banned just from your tone in this comment. Grow up.
---
Sotp dots.
---
Your experience is 100% opposite of mine
---
The difficulty is a big reason why it is fun, imo!
---
the mass cleave aoe stuff is all bullshit anyway all the people ive seen doing it are slow.
---
Just plebs following streamers thinking they're pro when they're just dodging stream snipers.
---
The shatter crit combo starts building up from level 25 when youll first be able to dump points into shatter (in combo with increased bonus crit damage talent)
---
lol its all crit fails from here on out.
---
On a side node, the addon "Necrosis" has a button to handle this, pretty well rounded addon for warlocks if you wanna try it
---
what, he can see everything in the game
---
he just needs to see it FASTER
---
FASTER GOD DAMMIT
---
Dire Maul IF in General in large city. In westfall chat sure its DM.
---
I've got the same problem. I'm in a queue now, started about 1½ hour ago at 3000 with 60 minute estimated time, now i'm at 4300+ with 101 minute estimated! Seems counterintuitive to say the least....
---
Yeah on a personal level I rolled on a PvP level to fight, gank, and be ganked. It's fun. It's a video game.
---
But - the Horde and Alliance factions aren't at war in Classic.
---
As a healer it is so easy to keep dps alive while they tank in these Dungeons. So it doesn't really matter
---
I got bodied 5 times in ten minutes last night  in the caves in northeast stone talon. Just decided to the game off after that haha.
---
Same. I almost rerolled out of a druid because I feared constant respecs and never being able to farm my own gold. Now I'm thinking of just being our token feral.
---
It will improve - you will kill 10 mobs in 10 seconds, then spend the next 10 seconds drinking.
---
Excuse my ignorance... but couldnt I already play that by just installing the original game? Or does it not work that way? Meaning if I just put in my old wow cd in, wouldnt I be able to play classic? I thought thats how it worked when burning crusade came out (i stopped playing shortly after bc)
---
Will Nefarian last 30 minutes minutes after release?
---
Pretty sure, by taking my time, that I missed participating in the world's first Rag kill.
---
Nothing wrong with taking a sex break every few hours
---
As a rogue....wtf u left us out?!
---
WoW classic is the first version of the game 1-60 on the last patch I believe. 
---
The race and classes are their original combos so only Tauren and Night Elves can be druids.
---
They're so fucking smug. Even a lot of people in *this* sub are posting about how this spells the downfall of Classic. 
---
Like, what the fuck? People want to play the fucking game, so let them do that and enjoy their time. 80% of players don't give a fuck that Rag was downed because they never had aspirations of downing him first to begin with. Most people don't play with that goal in mind.
---
So about that, MC and onyxia down already...
---
well said
---
That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die.
---
I wouldn't consider jumping people a dick move, it's part of being on a PvP server. I do think camping someone more than a couple times counts though.
---
If I start playing this next weekend. Do you think I'll still running into lots of players and what not?  I was going to wait untill it snows cause I'll have more time but I can't resist the hype.
---
Awesome.. what a dream come true.
---
Playing classic with your children, whoo boy. 
---
Too bad that when my son and daughter hit "level 15-17" WoW is probably finally dead..
---
Need to check this comment when 15 years has passed. See you later.
---
"free"   
---
Better check those quests again

---
Yeah you sound like an arsehole, you’re right about one thing, you won’t be missed.
---
You say holy is the slowest, but then you say smite is good? I'm confused.
---
Yeah I’m surprised my wife was even okay with my playing, but she also didn’t know me the first time I played classic. She’s heard plenty of horror stories from friends and family, though, so maybe she just wanted to get rid of me. I’ve done pretty well moderating my play time so far, but leveling was never an issue for me. She should start to worry if she ever hears me say, “I think I’m going to rank up in pvp again.”
---
It's 100% less difficult. Vanilla bosses are the equivalent of LFR in retail.
---
Yeah I remember when Rift was releasing and their ads were saying shit like "We're not in Azeroth anymore". Well, yeah, you're nowhere cause your game is dead.
---
I intend on grinding my T0 before entering MC. My goal isnt to beat the game, but feel the progression.
---
My group rerolled from Stalag to Sulfuras earlier this week. Those queues were too fucking ridiculous. I got home from work at 1am EST on Wednesday and there were 15k in queue. F that noise.
---
Ps. also subbed to your channel
---
What chat addon is this that changes colors of people based on class?
---
As a gnome rogue, I completely understand and agree with this statement. I don't even have to ask who hurt you...    I know my friend, I know...
---
pro tip:  
---
Dont buy potato with green patches on skin like this. Its no good.
---
I raided in vanilla on a 56k with 20 FPS in raids on the lowest settings and made it about halfway through aq40. People would regularly dc during raids and instances would even crash fairly regularly. There were a lot of technical issues that artificially increased the difficulty then that are nonexistent today. Technical issues aside a lot of people simply didn’t research the best spec and rotation for their class.
---
They came after some Blizzcon.
---
Mates probably thinking of state workers, you can commit a crime and still have your job.
---
Well, technically it’s not free, he was just riffin on you and you went nuclear
---
Honestly, stay away from 10k queues. What a waste of time to having to wait for that when you can play the game just fine on another sever will no or very short queue.
---
You should have a grace period if you log-out. I've never had queues from re-logging.
---
There are some QOL improvements. For example, originally, the only auction houses were in IF and Org. In the patch Classic is based on, they are also in Darn/SW/TB/UC. 
---
There are also some notable class talent differences.
---
That sounds healthy
---
So you’re telling me Alliance players wear lipstick? Well now we know why they get ganked.
---
Too bad you owe Capitalism everything you have in life including this game you love so much, grow up.
---
What a negative and low IQ comment. I see the type of person behind this before me. 
---
This guy made a really short and informative post regarding gold making. It was not primarily about farming xp. This might be useful for anyone that wants a mount at 40.
---
And then you swoop in and talk about nostalgia and having to play the game a certain way because it has to fit in to your view of the world. And then you make a demeaning comment about people going for world first and claim it has no achievement because it was cleared 10 years ago like jokered didn't have almost 100k+ viewers watching and CARING.
---
Yeah if you have a lot of time to play this is also how I would feel, but with limited time this becomes very bothersome as you really cannot progress without 5-8 hours sessions.
---
I'm playing as druid and took herbalism+skinning. Plan is to drop skinning and take alchemy later on but I'm wondering if I should even bother with skinning? How much gold will I actually make if I vendor everything?
---
Amen brother,  been using those 2 addons for a few years. I used to use failbot (healbot) damn thing keep crashing.
---
&gt; they had healers almost go AFK on majordomo because the boss hardly does any fucking damage
---
You said those words. So either you were trying to imply something that isn't true, or you know absolutely nothing about the fight (because he has NEVER hit hard, it's always been all about add control).
---
Getting server firsts in a raid of 40 doesn't mean you didn't get carried, it just means you rolled on a slow server and the top raiding guilds had spots for baddies.
---
Absolutely!  Me too!
---
Are you able to maintain the look of the default WoW UI with it though? All I want is 2 extra action bars and to move my vertical ones on the right to be horizontal above the others.
---
you mean those who a tuned up and harder than classic
---
Shhhhhhh don’t tell them the secrets
---
Most people settle with a plus 10

---
on average one drops every 625 so you're close! or still really far away. Impossible to say but gamblers fallacies sure make grinding more bearable.
---
Hey OP I've been going through learning about this game lately. I've seen alot of spec or whatever, if you don't mind can I get a small explanation? When we talk spec is that like the screen shots I see of skill trees? I I shine you only have to pick one? Like a mage is frost, fire and something else?
---
\&gt;I pictured WoD level of fuckery, kudo's to blizz for making things go so smoothly.  
---
Thats what you said. Its not rocketscience.
---
Patch 1.12 is the preparation patch for TBC. After all the major talent revamps that were game changing for every class. Threat reductions, damage increases, etc. Just like the end of every expansion sense then, when all of a sudden anybody can clear raid content, because the pre-patch for expansions is always scaling for the next expansion.
---
If you were so great in vanilla, you should probably take a deep breath before you have an aneurysm over a world first. It is a world first in vanilla classic, done in 5 days, from 1-60 and rag/ony dead. It takes nothing away from the innovators that did it 15 years ago, but this was just as remarkable as vanilla world first because of the time frame.
---
TL;DR - get the fuck over yourself. You suck.
---
Of course but you still have to figure out something for the stone that is my heart
---
i don't get it.
---
I added a separate toggle for map and minimap icons to Questie yesterday. It's not in a release yet, so if you want to use it right now you'd need to download the current state of the repo. But next release should happen soonish.
---
Yeah the “ race “ is somewhat different as well being that there isn’t any unknowns about the encounters hehe.
---
Whole everyone has a screenshot button, not all have access to a recording tool
---
Even better. Gotta break those arms son!
---
Did you mean wow in the state it existed 15 years ago? because that and classic wow are different beings
---
“Wait till I get my main!”
---
NOCHANGES
---
It's a different kind of blue ribbon though. Whereas originally, there was a lot of bumbling and clumsy failing, now it's a high-octane race. That unfortunately incentivizes game abuse.
---
It's pretty good if you're not using Voidwalker.
---
If you're tanking either way then using shadowbolt is bad because you keep getting interrupted so you can only wand, however if you get searing pain you will usually be able to cast it between enemy attacks without interruption which could increase your DPS.
---
Worth giving a try IMO.
---
Pretty sure I heard February is Phase 2.
---
I had 12 gold last night, 12!!! 
---
Then I hit level 30. And now I'm broke and my dreams of saving 100g till 40 have been shattered.
---
You wont struggle for skill points on the pets, plus you can respec and all the points from the lower skills will get refunded.
---
Google search wow vanilla pet skills just make sure you get the most recent up to date claw / bite and other skills you would like. And you'll be fine!
---
\*crazy high populations on all the servers considering how many have been added since launch! They SEVERELY underestimated the player-counts, even though I'm sure we all knew that :)
---
I love all of you, hope you're having as much fun as I am!
---
Vendor everything up to medium leather, then when you get heavy leather start putting it u on the AH, you’ll get way more than vendor price
---
Firstly, don’t be mean to the guy he was giving suggestions. Secondly, this is classic so they aren’t changing anything with it so nut up or shut up
---
My roommate had me do this for him on Friday. No shame
---
Yup, the multiple forms for druids are freaking awesome!
---
Downside is that you need to buy more spells! :-/
---
You don't even need base wow. Legit just need an active sub.
---
How does it feel to follow an ideology that's responsible for more deaths than the third reich?
---
How 'bout all dem shamans who like spamming rockbiter and the various warrior DPS who like using demo shout and sunder. *cries in no aggro*
---
The same server where I beat apes ?
---
Shut the fuck up you have no idea what you are talking about. Ofc the adds do most of the damage..
---
If you try to gank in the goblin towns, the guards will make you their bitch. People generally don't try anything, it's not worth the repair bill.
---
Same goodbye Herod and whitemane hello smolderweb
---
It’s like when people wear a red shirt in target and everyone starts asking them questions about the store.
---
They have been playing on private servers for 10 years, they have done all the content multiple times.
---
they don't know what hard work really is xD let him go
---
Yeah, Ashenvale last night was absolutely packed with both Horde and Alliance. For the most part, we let eachother be. If we fought every time we saw a player of the opposite faction, it'd be constant fighting and no one would get any quests done.
---
ok thank you:)
---
You were killing stuff while someone started the kolkar banner quest. Stay away from the event.
---
No, just no... please no.
---
Back to the shithole as we speak. Good.
---
i wish i was type A, but my level 15 Warlock implies that i am type B
---
that's not a suggestion, he's a troll.
---
It'll be just fine, just don't crank up any settings
---
Not trying to throw shade.. Are they employed?
---
"I ruin peoples day because orc story"
---
You can come up with whatever excuse to be an asshole, we're all just trying to quest right now.
---
Oh you gotta be quicker than that!
---
These guys must take full advantage of adult diapers!
---
You didn't need Naxx gear to do that.
---
I remember making an alt on Demon Soul, which was a server that came up after AQ and just a few months before Naxx release. There was an alliance guild that rolled there called &lt;Denial&gt; that fucking streamrolled everything sort of like the pserver players are doing in classic. They were slower to 60, but once they got there they were doing basically the same shit. 
---
They were doing 4x10 split runs of Onyxia to farm cloaks for nef. They had a rogue who was wearing like 6/8 Bloodfang by the \~3rd week but he still had fucking triprunner dungarees.
---
The early raids are just fucking easy, that's all there is to it.
---
How the fuck do Plainstriders and Crocolisks parry you anyway? Not to mention kodo's. Beasts shouldn't be able to parry Blizzard pls fix
---
I took a week off of work.  I have 1 day /played into a 20 priest and 1 day /played into a 19 warrior.  I think I've averaged 8-9 hours of playtime a day.  The only reason I have such a low amount of /played, for the time taken off work to play classic, is the sheer number of people playing makes it not worth my time to play in the evenings.  So few people want to group for quests its nearly impossible to continue when everyone is on.
---
I didn't necessarily want to take a whole week off from work for classic but pto carry over rules and life circumstances dictated it (divorce) lol.  It was a fun way to spend a week though.
---
There are some recipes that sell for a good bit more than the vendor price. It's not much at low levels (1-2s per item), but I think the trend continues. It's not a lot, but it adds up, especially since there is no much free leather out there. FWIW, I've never had issues paying for training and skills and such since I found these recipes. I'm only level 17, but it's been a definite help.
---
PS: It's not the most efficient way to level leatherworking, but it's easy and it's better than just making a bunch of armor kits and vendoring them.
---
And im here with my 20 lock, being super happy when i won the loot of WC last boss ring (deep fathom ring)
---
I’ve read Marx, in full translation and original German. Das Kapital, Manifesto, 1844 Manuscripts...if you at any point have read his poorly written works, you would get that communism is unsustainable and morally wrong.
---
Also, see Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
---
Thanks for all the replies people, I'll visit this stormpike guy and do a bit of questing there, and then return to my beloved westfall :)
---
Fuck I forgot about that
---
So glad I chose smolderweb. Good community &amp; decent player count &amp; no queue
---
Lol my thoughts exactly. Although eq is built around long spawn times. They specifically designed mana regen and downtime to be long to. Open up time for socializing.
---
Honestly, Cataclysm + was set up for that, so it’s more satisfying in Classic for sure
---
The main game is simpler and easier to navigate and level in. Play a new character there and see how you feel before dropping cash for Classic. Classic leveling has random bumps and hiccups that can slow pace where as the main game has much smoother questing and leveling rates as well as more simplified character progression and choices.
---
People are already hitting 60?
---
Wow hit a sensitive spot there now didnt we.
---
I rolled skinning, which is great, until I went to learn artisan level and found out it costs 5g.
---
even if he was talking about the mana cost (which he wasn't, since he referred specifically to the quest) I maintain that he's a dumbass for nitpicking to that degree
---
&gt; skinning makes a lot of money, is that just from selling the hides to vendors? 
---
Yes, to vendors since most people don't have a lot of money to spend on the AH.
---
&gt; Also, can I switch professions after I've chosen them somehow?
---
Yes, with the caveat that the new professions will (always) start over at level 1.
---
Personally, I don't like jumping people because it doesn't feel like a fair fight. I don't hold it against other people when they do that, though. It is a pvp server after all.
---
One of my friends loves retail and said he hates the boring combat of Classic and the quests having abysmal drop rates makes no sense. To be fair he’s right about the drop rates but the combat is so much more enjoyable imo. I don’t destroy everything in one shot I actually have to think
---
So? Point is, and what I’m saying, is there are no meme specs around. You are literally arguing for something they did not even use.
---
They’ve also done this hundred of times, are you accounting that for your average guild? They managed to do this because this is just another day for these guys.
---
Also from lack of medical care.
---
Log in during low times of the day. So I’m for example I live in the EST time zone, I will log in at about 3-6am to avoid the que. DO NOT attempt to log in during high times like 5-9pm.. always get there before people get off from work
---
Let tell you about goretusk livers my friend lol
---
I normally hate that ques in retail, but it took me an hour in retail and honestly I had fun just farming and goofing off in chat the whole time. It's just different somehow
---
https://youtu.be/xTPn_Nk_KrM
---
I’ll just say, I am impressed by WF Mythic kills. I was impressed by rag and ony kills in vanilla. 0% impressed by Classic kills
---
Someone compiled theorycraft data a while back. Ret paladin outdps frost mage for MC gear level. Mage only beat paladin in the subsequent tier, since they scale better, especially in fire spec.
---
How is paid xfer much different than just swapping servers at this point. That sucks that your friends are so inflexible but we're not even a week in so if you're hard stuck on a server then that's a you problem. If you can't convince your 30+ people to switch you're sure as hell not convincing all of them to paid xfer.
---
Does bartender allow you to configure bars in a 4x3 layout to match up with N mmo mouse?
---
Just fly to random zones and look for players of the opposing faction to engage in world pvp with. I'm a level 35 human warrior. I went to STV last night with the sole purpose of pvp in mind, didn't even bother with the quests I had. Attacked a level a level 41 priest and level 34 mage, naturally got obliterated. After ressing, I stood next to them and the mage and I agreed to duel through emotions. Had a duel fair and square. I lost, of course, but it was fun.
---
A night elf warrior?
---
Try again with human next time..
---
I did 2 BFD runs last night and both of them had that runner problem. Luckily out of both runs only one dps died thanks to a shitshow pull, but he was on the floor for 10mins as we scoured the zone for that runner. He was hiding behind the wall to the temple area around a inch wide ledge
---
nah, not with the debuff limit
---
Can't say I'm much in to the lore of the Burning Blade but I was always under the impression that they were an exclusive melee orcanization whereas the ones in Desolace appear to have even undead members who are casters at that. 
---
Even more weird is that their undead are not classified as undead so a Paladin can't smash them with Exorcism.
---
How does the 10man SM work?
---
So if I’m using a wand then I should also be looking for off hands for extra stats right? Or do those not really exist in classic
---
Awesome, 40 ppl who have done this hundreds of times on private servers. They deserve it.. they are also the .00001%
---
Can’t people just play the game and not worry about how fast other people are doing it
---
Sword spec
---
I'll be sure to let everyone know how impressed or not you are with them
---
Mining and herbalism are the bigger money makers I found.
---
for the people whove been playing on pservers for 15 years, yeah lol
---
Roll back on all the people abusing it #nochanges
---
What meme specs were in the raid?
---
thats what i did granted i only have f5 through f8 for skull Cross square and moon, if i need more then those 4 im most likely in a raid and i dont need the time save from using em
---
He‘s probably refering to sword specialization which gives human +5 in sword skills. Not that it matters much for ashkandi, which is clearly a PvP Weapon for alliance warriors. Horde might use it for slam build tho
---
For the Horde!
---
ElvUI
---
&gt;Such a quick MC completion ruins the spirit of the game
---
But it doesn't impact you in the slightest. *Nothing* changes just because some guild cleared MC already.
---
Just keep playing the game like you were.
---
Race is not a huge deal compared to spec, they go gnome and dwarf because racials matter in PvP.
---
The greater player investment grows with levels over time, the less likely they are to abandon a server. While queues will probably drop, I expect some servers to have some degree of queues for at least the coming year. The Outland realm has always had the same problem.
---
*laughs in priest with enchanting*
---
Quick Q. Back then I played in 2015 for one month then sub was too much. I've always wanted to participate in these 20 mam raids and get the best loot. I see people have done this already but realistically, a guy like me knows next to nothing and just went to wowhead for the first time this morning.  
---
 How long would I expect to take to get to LVL 60 and beat these final boss's I see ppl posting about.
---
There's a big chance they won't be as kind? As a rogue not needing on casting gear? I have yet to have people need when it isn't an upgrade for them.
---
Yeah, this picture describes what has been annoying me about classic. Just enjoy the god damn game why does everything have to be a rush? Y'all know what happens, it's a rerelease, you're going to have nothing to do if you just bum rush every end game objective.
---
yup, we did too.  I never really thought to question it
---
None of what you wrote is even remotly on the level of WoD launch.
---
Good fucking job picking a full server dumbass, Blizz only warned everyone, basically every day, for about a week prior to launch that the queues would be huge.  You want to know how many queues I've sat in since the game launched?  1 at 7pm on a Friday night, because I didn't pick the most full server that was open.
---
Also, yes, putting in game time even a day early would have been very smart, to quote you
---
&gt;Its not rocketscience.
---
No shit their servers were going to be hit hard on day 1.
---
Lol Method sure got btfo eh?
---
Wait how do you autorun?
---
Honestly don't try and tank *everything*. Some DPS can burn mobs, others like to kite/solo b/c their bored, and some like to AOE. The only problem is when you get all 3 types in 1 group. At that point plant your feet and establish "run to me if you need help" as the tank and just tank in your vicinity. Either they don't need your help, they'll come to you for help, or they'll die and learn a lesson.
---
what i dont get, is why people like you, think these top players whove been doing this for 15 years, are the fucking "main playerbase".
---
Bro, bro, Ret paladin isn't a meme spec. Ret paladin isn't a spec at all.
---
[lol do you fucking libs even read theory?](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18401/forors-compendium-of-dragon-slaying)
---
Teach the game for sure, not basic social interaction I'm not their father
---
Log out for an your? You mean log out for 6 minimum?
---
All Blizzard needs to do is just open a new server every few months and people will get the "classic" experience on a fresh server.
---
Maybe some high level rouge ganked you. 
---
Sneak in, kill low level players and vanish again. At least that's what I guess if you are on a pvp server.
---
“Classic race to world first presented by WSOE &amp; Method” not “Method race to get classic world first”.
---
Is amazing for its level, not "was" anymore... classic is back out after all.
---
I cancelled my sub today..  it's the worst gaming experience I've ever had,  waiting 8 hrs is not tolerable
---
U mean 2% max
---
As someone who played in vanilla this is absolutely not true. We had a hunter who played on 56K, DCed regularly, and was basically nothing but a burden and it didn’t matter. Several other borderline useless DPS too because the biggest challenge was just filling 40 slots every week. With 40 people compared to 25, the need for personal responsibility goes way down.
---
poop
---
While I don't play classic, here to hoping they revamp it. The old vanilla honor system had all the excitement of a piece of brick.
---
Ascent killed rag in 2005, word first 😀
---
So happy I sucked it up and left stalagg, now I never have to worry about queues on benediction
---
I'm definitely type b. Not like there are going to be expansions going to make the most of it
---
Heirlooms dudnt exist before mop
---
I have tried different places and standing side by side to other people fishing. Can I fish outside WC for example when I have 0 skill?
---
Yeah not a fan of that, i wanna keep the entire bottom bar, gryphons and everything and just add 4 more action bars above them you know? Thanks anyway!
---
Nor sure how that was a response. Projecting history! Ya got me!
---
I’m referring to my own personal experience as I used it leveling my warrior.
---
On a tablet
---
Which add ons do you need?
---
The only time I found pre-shielding to work well so far was with heavy hitting bosses like the big nature elemental and murloc in WC.
---
It's only meta when you have nightfall and belong to a raiding guild.  I'm talking about a level 22 hunter without a pet aspect of the cheatahing up to mobs and raptor strike spamming.  THATS the way I roll....
---
Sure, the guild that's all about world firsts says it wasn't about that at all once they lost.
---
Also, there is no error message displaying.
---
"Free"
---
I'll clue you in to a little known secret, your one and only resource in wow is time. Wasting time doing annoying shit that serves no purpose when you could be eating some human warrior's booty hole or leveling is just dumb.
---
Doing better than me. I planned to finally get some time to play this evening after being at a wedding all weekend but now I've got a four delay to my flight.
---
Aaaah fair enough.
---
Mage level 56 here; its fine.   
---
Mages up to level 20 level rather slowly. Im personally not a huge fan of the arcane explosion aoe farm, but it works.   
---
After level 20 and the classic imp blizzard 3/3 two levels later you will go like lightning however. Just practice aoe a lot when you get it, expect to die a lot too. Even pros can die to a single mob resisting a spell.   
---
And a headsup; you wont be able to aoe-farm is youre level 10 right now. Every place you visit will probably be farmed to absolute heck. If you find that you cant really benefit from aoe-farming, then dont hesitate to switch to single-dps and spec for that.
---
There are way more people on here who play and enjoy both versions, myself included, than you apparently think. It’s pretty pathetic to gatekeep a 15 year old game.
---
sucks. Opening of Ahn'Qiraj is going to suck everywhere but they'll likely fuck over the economy to get all the mats cheap leading up to it

Really explain the analytic method he used to evaluate material conditions of a given society, Also how does that relate to morality ? I have , and it's moralistic propaganda. He loves to tally the death counts under Stalin and the USSR but neglects the historical context of what Russia was before the revolution. He even has the audacity to say that Russia wasn't ready for revolution . This is ridicules when you see the huge leaps the USSR made in the subsequent years after the October revolution. A  vast backward country into the world’s second industrial power, a country in which illiteracy has been significantly decreased (almost to 0) , in which the number of doctors and the number of new books published is among the highest in the world, in which the infant mortality rate was among the lowest in the world. And look how the Russian people are doing after the break up of the USSR. Do you ever wonder why so many of these polls of ex-USSR countries have such fond memories of the soviet times? Has Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn ever tallied the deaths under capitalism ? more than 100 million die every year to preventable causes, their only crime being that they are too poor.
---
You can play without macros and be viable, but macros surely help. Look around on old warrior class forums and websites, there's sure to be a trove of useful stuff there.
---
Pssh, half way to 17
---
&gt;what i dont get, is why people like you, think these top players whove been doing this for 15 years, are the fucking "main playerbase".
---
I guess I didn't know FFXIV had gotten that mainstream. I find it surprising that people are still not willing to talk flaws with you years later. I'm not really sure what else I can say about that, I pretty much guarantee that there will be lots of discussion about Classic WoW's shortcomings in a few months. In the meantime I hope you manage to find some enjoyment out of the game.
---
Yes. Even lore mentioned farming maraudon for this trinket to do AQ in one of the Q&amp;A's but my guild never did any of that nonsense and we killed everything just fine.
---
Same with this cookie cutter nonsense everyone on r/wow keeps spouting. Plenty of odd specs raiding. You just needed to know what you were doing.
---
And doing MC in 1.12 patch makes those things even more pointless.
---
Den som sa det han var det
---
I have always really like Xperl for unit frames.  Easy to figure out with lots of options.
---
 what i dont get, is why people like you, think these top players whove  been doing this for 15 years, are the fucking "main playerbase".
---
What else does one do you Reddit?
---
Video games simply cannot exist under communism
---
Grind mobs that drop high-value vendor trash
---
This is how I felt raiding for the first time in wotlk lol The group's I got into people would constantly shit on me for my low dps but always decided not to kick me because I knew how to listen to the leader giving the plan and stay out of fires.
---
Thanks! that should solve it!
---
Not everyone who played back then thinks this. Evidence is more important than any # of old players who "swear they remember it being harder." There a million reasons why it might seem that way but you need to prove that it's because they tuned it secretly at some nebulous point.
---
Easier to read sure but it's all about the &lt; or &gt;
---
Impale is not very good when levelling, but Deep Wounds is good, adds over 100 damage to your crits.
---
Definitely type B, by rushing levelling you're blazing the surface of the game and will burn out with little to do at sixty. Also why are people using questie and those type off quest help add-ons? It's literally like questing in retail if you use those add-ons, just read the text and figure it out it's so much more rewarding and enjoyable an add-on I like to use that breaks the paragraph of quest text down is immersion.
---
Yeah I mean honestly for a second there I was going to take the Wingblade 1hander reward, because I was in the same train of thought that staff = caster loot, but to your point it is really good DPS even though it’s a staff.
---
I send every gold i make to a banking alt so I don't spend it on my main.
---
Ah, look, it's George Osborne.
---
Nope roomie playing on same line and has never had that disconnection error
---
I'm savouring the experience. I'm taking my time, I'm cooking, I'm fishing, I'm exploring, I'm levelling my engineering. All the stuff that I usually ignore and powerlevel once I hit the endgame. I'm in no rush to finish Westfall I'm having a blast.
---
I do, and I recommend it. Every spell in the game is situationally useful.
---
Most classic collection quests work like this, when involving tradeable mats.
---
Any/all? I haven’t looked into them much at all
---
Ι prefer my real life friends.. in addition to all those online I will make.
---
Guilds loot only handful of pieces per raid. There will be content to do for a long time since people are waiting for next phase.
---
The assumption of factions being split 50/50 is probably part of the issue.  
---
Even in retail some server faction balances are crazy off.  Look at realm pop stats for illidan in retail it’s like 300k horde and 15k alliance
---
Ha hahah you sound entitled
---
AMD has also had ReLive for several years.
---
Does searching the code have anything useful?
---
Do you have the fishing rod equipped?
---
Numlock friendo, now you can pack a bowl while hoofing it to the next quest line.
---
As a hunter who’s level 15 I’ve had several levels of useless shit recently lol

It's disgusting.
---
I didnt get in after the two hours though. My position in queue just raised the whole time so i just gave up. Can't connect like this.
---
You can actually have a wand equipped at the same time as your main weapon/offhand. The wand has its own slot so you don’t have to choose one or the other :)
---
Yeah and maybe when new raids comes out you can only progress one boss per week.
---
Also lets have all gear come naturally over time by you loggin in for a couple minutes every day, that will work wonders.
---
You mean when they beat with less than 40 people? If less than 40 can beat it, you can fill the rest up with meme specs and still beat it and everyone is happy except for your little sour asshole who only wants perfectly optimized try hards.
---
They'll have their downtime... When they hit 60 and find out there's absolutely nothing for them.to do till yhere are more lvl60s
---
That would be righteous. However, more crucial is to hotfix the bug. The Classic Dev Team needs to hear about this bug as fast as possible as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people are exploiting it as we speak.
---
You’re literally on the subreddit for this game. 
---
You’re salty as fuck hahahah.
---
ELI5? I want it too! just not sure what to eddit in confg
---
So barren
---
Vendoring tbh. Not much profit to be made on the AH atm.
---
On my server there are really only 2 things selling OK - ore (because a lot of people are level 30 with  only 60 skill in mining) and cloth (because tailoring and everyone is using their cloth to level first aid so the market isn’t flooded).
---
no

---
I recommend using wowhead.com for your questions like this in the future.
---
Nope. It's not Blizzard's responsibility to parent us. We must manage our own life and health. They simply provide a great entertainment to us.
---
It's personal entirely. The reason I use questie is because not having quest markers in an MMO is terrible game design. I don't mind it not showing me where to go, but it is way wayyy to easy to actually end up missing quests. Questie let's me see where all my quest's are for pick up which is a massive massively needed QoL change.
---
Can you link proof? Not that I don't believe you I'm just curious
---
Nope, only jumping now gets you DC'd.
---
My script is random and doesn't fire often.
---
Yeah, I feel you.
---
A friend was casting a frostbolt on an enemy, and another guy blinked &gt; arcane explosion into the same mob...
---
That's my character's name on world of Warcraft .
---
We aren't keeping layering forever tho so I don't see it as a priority like just ignoring a game system that's fucked forever.
---
A small portion of the community will get a small advantage over the rest us, when the people doing it will have had a huge lead and power regardless I'm not that bothered.
---
Id rather just not worry about hitting trade caps via layering, struggling to form group for boss mods as someone cant merge servers etc. Than I do worry about the people playing sixteen hours a say dominating the economy more than they already do.
---
“World first”
---
No, gating systems is the most retarded thing you can have in a game like wow
---
Thanks! I tried aha
---
Of all the things to be upset about, you choose video games.
---
Yea they destroyed the mmorpg genre by having the entire genre chase them for some wow pie by making them all stupid easy, unchallenging, soulless, empty experiences, and ride that out for over a decade.
---
Then on the verge of new upcoming mmorpg's to feed player's starving for some challenge they drop this one "again" to feed them all.
---
Now they are well feed and will be far too entrenched and invested into classic to even think about starting over again somewhere else.
---
Classic is a wonderful game I can't wait for you to enjoy it mate :)
---
I've played on vanilla pservers and played in multiple Raids that wipe on this content.
---
With that kind of attitude you aren't going to get far in classic. I googled it and didn't get an answer. I'd rather not buy bfa if its not needed.
---
Your too dumb to read properly because if you wernt, you would of read the part where I said I'm already playing and it's for my Mrs.

Me lol'ing at all the people saying this MC is easy, meanwhile I remember doing the MC re-release for WoW's 10th Anniversary and people endlessly dying to Core Hound packs.
---
Blizzard is rollong content out in Phases so that we can gradually progress through Vanilla naturally. So, we are currently in "Phase 1". 
---
Phase 2 will bring the honor system and battlegrounds, along with some more pve raids
---
I use ElvUI, it has presets for dps/tank and healer, and it’s totally customizable if you desire.
---

Almost told a healer to not bother healing me if I'm life tapping. Lol.
---
riposte can only be triggered right after you parry an attack, and it can soemtimes be hard to see when you parry and react fast. So a macro that allows you to use riposte whenever its available is very good IMO
---
Can’t say, we’ll see ;)
---
I started the game for the first time since I was like 16 or 17 to play with some friends. They're on a really high pop server so I've got to wait in the queue, which I am now. My question is, why tf is the queue getting longer? It's like I'm permanently last on it. Since I've queued up my position has only gone up and my wait time has only gotten longer. I keep asking them if I should leave the queue and come back but they say that'll make it worse. But it's only getting longer anyway! What do I doooooooooo and why is this even possible
---
If you think that you didn't play vanilla wow. The only thing people kept talking about was how "the game starts at 60 man!"

This was in 2006

Give PvP a shot!:) 
---
It's the most dynamic aspect of the game, every fight is different. 
---
At lvl 60 it'll keep you busy in between raid nights as well.
---
Yeah that isn't surprising.  I said its "technically" still going, because the end objective had not been met but everyone knew that apes was going to kill her very soon.

Nope, for BFA you need to buy BFA
---
This is post-vanilla lore, though. It wasn't canon at all until quite recently; just before Legion in fact if memory serves. They did a whole screening and released a big hardcover book series about the revamped cosmology. Personally, as a lorebuff since the Warcraft 3 days, I reject it.
---
They run with 10 man groups. You get 10% less exp from mobs (normally you get mob exp divided by 5 now you get 90% exp divided by 10) upside is you clear very fast and spam same dungeon to have high exp per hour
---
What game?
---
I got delays on launch day when i was surrounded by about 1,000 people but after that I was fine.
---
Yeah but when all you have is witnesses then that is your most reliable source even if it isn't fool-proof.
---
I had to make it work with a trackpad!
---
Question, any way to make the Raid Bars on the left in the video do that in live without addons or at least without UI art changing addons?

I don't mind when it sticks out a bit but I did an Epic Battleground and it went across the screen so far.

Subjective opinion: Retail sucks.
---
Yes you use hemo, it's a great combopoint builder which allows you to stunlock very easily, and deal good dps while doing. Usually people go coldblood in assassination, then down to hemo prep and dirty deeds in sub. 
---
It's considered a bit of a "noob spec" since it's a lot easier than dagger though, but lots of fun.
---
Awesome thanks, I was under the impression you had to buy retail. Thanks for clarification :)

It's definitely still a world first. Classic wow isn't vanilla wow, they are different games and completely separate releases

 Patch 1.5.0 (2005-06-07): The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now always happen while Ragnaros is in combat. However, these lava eruptions occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.
---
The maximum range of the Wrath of Ragnaros spell has been increased.
---
Patch 1.4.0 (2005-05-05): Ragnaros now stays up 2 hours rather than 1 after being summoned.
---
Patch 1.3.0 (07-Mar-2005):
---
Added in-game voice for Ragnaros and Majordomo Executus.
---
Sons of Flame now despawn when everyone wipes.
---
Ragnaros will reset properly if the raid wipes while submerged.
---
Or because it's monotonous carrot on a stick.

Huh, I didn't think of that. But I love the dense reactive foliage.

This is pretty much cookie cutter for tanking.  All good stuff here
---
I started on the newest server at a time with next to no queues, but in just one day it got to full with now 8k people in queue any day afternoon. I'm not moving anywhere just to get the same experience, plus doing the 30 or so levels of the quests I just did. I now I'm not the only one like this and I did everything right, by choosing the newest servers with supposedly lowest population. This is something that blizzard will need to fix, by locking the servers, adding layers and doing free transfers.
---
Less maintenance, less durability but a much higher upside if organized. BM hunters really aren't anything special until The Beast Within buff in TBC since it allowed them to be immune to cc.

You can match up the queue times using this page on wowhead once you have the EDT/EST server picked out:

---
That's awesome! Also, is cloth farming profitable with no auction house play (like only selling it to mechants)?
---
Ohhhh okay I see what you mean now. That actually makes a lot more sense to me, I appreciate the input. I couldn’t find any guide for this so you’re helping me a lot lol
---
Wait, we ARE talking about that roof being fixed, right ? :)
---
Legion was great but it was such a different game and experience. I really missed so many things in classic even with a good retail expansion.

Yes, most are fine. People complain about queues because everyone and their mother “need” to play on the server with the streamers. So those servers are absolutely packed. I play on a server that says high or full all the time but I haven’t had a queue since the first day.
---
How do you do that consistently? Do they all make money through wow somehow or do they have a job they can put on hold for a few weeks every time a server opens?
---
You talk about it like it's a deadly disease or something.
---
If the tank is getting slaughtered and you need to buy time for another heal, of course use it then so then don’t die. otherwise try to not use shield on warriors. Hard enough holding threat with the little amount of rage they do get.
---
Big true
---
The [Well of Eternity](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Well_of_Eternity) is a font of Arcane power, since the planet contains a titan soul.
---
I use Questie and MonkeyQuest. Seems like a good setup so far. If Questie starts acting up (showing quests to pickup that aren't there or whatever) just type `/reload` and you should be good again.
---
Yeah I am wondering if what makes it work is the shared pain? The ‘we’re all in this together brother’
---
Nice math you got there buddy.
---
1 rule of tanking : the healer is the only one you care about. The dps'ers are mouth breathers. Even if they get mad and leave, the run will still go on. They are also a dime a dozen, so nobody cares what they think. 
---
Also, keep a shit list with you. If one of them gets mouthy, be sure to keep them on the list and simply refuse to tank future instances with them in it. You'd laugh knowing how many dps'ers I got kicked out of their group because a tank or healer is a far, FAR more important to the run than a random mouth breather.
---
Do you seriously think that vanilla skillcap is high? Have you ever stepped into the mythic raid?
---
I mean, this function is built into wow...and the key binding can be changed.
---
Server hopping would *be* shit at managing server pops. Having actions be inconsequential is a sure-fire way to turn a cooperative community into a rampant self-serving-behaviour-fueled one.
---
Yup, git gud or git out
---
Hah no I won't. Horde has overrun Ashenvale. I'm not touching that zone.
---
nost had short growth from people finding out about it.  it's peak was smaller then some server queues.
---
And yet people forget how they will strangle a server's economy just for an edge, community be damned.
---
They enacted two faction brutal mafias to control server economies and make life miserable for everyone. We won't see cross faction collusion like this in Classic, but expect other troll tactics.
---
 I feel bad for Horde on Gehennas because Apes is gonna ruin their lives with Flight Master Camps, Questgiver camps (no DKs till Phase 2) and other griefing methods.
---
That’s like saying it’s not illegal if you never get caught. 
---
And it didn’t take a long time to shut down down Pirate Bay. It was shut down in 2006 quite quickly by the Swedish police because the MPAA (America) asked them to. 
---
The reason they were/are able to keep reopening is because they deploy mechanics that make it hard to find the actual hosts. Furthermore, since it’s an index, it’s quite quick and fast to upload and start again (it’s literally a 100mb file). This has nothing to do with enforcement.
---
WHY DO YOU TELL THEM??  IT supposed to be a secret place :D i farmed so much gold yesterday there. now it will be flooded with people
---
If youre playing casually, it might take tou around a month or so to hit 60.
---
Doing endgame raiding is all about finding a good guild and knowing the mechanics.
---
Theres plenty of resources to learn. If youre serious about wanting to raid, start studying the fights now.
---
I thought I was going crazy. Roommate and gf don't have this problem. I do. My roommate noticed it as well when playing my PC one day for me
---
per spell.
---
You only play to get world first?
---
Played for hours yesterday and gained exactly one level, and I'm not even mad.  That including whoring my tailoring out in redridge, doing some laps in loch modan in fishing pools, doing the run to buy the cook book and fishing book for max 225.  And best of all READING THE QUESTS.
---
damn Jitters, you done did it didn't you.  Poor Sven.
---
As much as I hate Desolace, it feels like a good idea.
---
Also, no add-ons here so it can't be that
---
Too bad classic is already essentially ruined by it, too late for it to matter might aswell keep it up so everyone can abuse this shitty game evenly xd.. 
---
Nah jk fix it of course but yeah the race is over.
---
yeah... I haven't been actually happy in a long time but I guess I can go play classic wow to escape that reality for a little longer
---
have a good one
---
first of all these look amazing
---
second to add to the immersion you should only let him eat one every hour
---
Doubt it. They have an entire guild of r14's by then and they have done BWL in like 30 minutes on private servers. That takes a lot of practice. Seriously non private server guilds can stop dreaming about doing anything first, can't compete with private server autism.
---
Oh, ok. Never played WoW, just wanted to try because idk if I would like.
---
You probly saw a Druid in travel form not cat form.
---
[I guess this one is the manifesto](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6916/tome-of-divinity)
---
Are you playing on an iPad?
---
What all are you skipping? Asking for my broke ass
---
my man has a big brain, thinks on the spot, no time to wait
---
So... Are there no good players in Classic except APES? Because nobody else came close to challenging them for this.
---
if you're crafting you're not making money.  this isn't wotlk where you could buy all the red gems and cut them and make a 20% profit margin over and over again every day.  At this point at best you're investing in smithing or enchanting taking a massive hit right now in hopes that you'll get arcanite reapers and enchanted thorium bars and crusader enchants and stuff like that rolling out early and make a killing on crafting fees.
---
gosh lua looks so messy where are all the squiggly brackets and line breaks
---
Where? *desire to know more intensifies*
---
You sure it wasn’t a Tauren?
---
It's the first week of wow classic. It's going to be that way fo a couple months until things start to balance and more players are spread out across the map. Everyday there are new players playing. These starting zones are going to be congested like crazy for awhile. 
---
Now you know why blizzard had to implement the layering system. If we didn't have layering, it would be 10x worse.
---
Theres a 5m grave period for people who disconnect from queue to get back to where they were same as in game but it happening over 2 hours sounds insane
---
Queue depends on people logging off so it can get longer if they’re not logging off
---
I started in Legion and am level 36, not stopping till 60. I don't think it's a "they started after vanilla/BC" issue, but it's just the person themself who is impatient naturally.
---
They play because they enjoy the optimization and they like hanging out together
---
No they didn’t they went down to 14 people and still cleared it.
---
Yeah, had the same problem. I fixed it by modifying the texture on the exp bar and then clicking on the bar itself. I think you can manage the bar’s properties by invoking /doom and then right clicking the exp bar.
---
And nothing of value was lost!
---
They said they aren't sure, and will think about what to do later if there is demand for more content. For the next two or three years the plan is to just leave it as vanilla including everything that was release before the first expansion.
---
For some reason it says aug 20 for me. Thanks, question solved
---
Pretty sure you need the base game and subscription. Like not the newest expansion ect if one comes out but just the game in general.
---
Because we are at war son.
---
/disagree
---
This is true.
---
Yeah I agree, I can’t even play the game without wuestie. Why the fuck would I want to walk into every building in every town I visit just to find every quest and have constant anxiety that I missed one and didn’t do X chain so I look even stupider in the RFC when I don’t have all the quests. Some people weren’t massive virgins 15 years ago and questie is the only way/ reason I’ll be playing wow with my pals
---
Welcome to classic
---
We haven’t had any fights yet, and hopefully I can keep myself in check so that never happens. I’m definitely a little jealous of my friends who are still single, though. Most of them are 30-40 and I’m hoping I’ll be able to finally do some Dead Mines runs sometime next week.
---
Best advice I could give it just dive in the community is helpful learn as you go
---
Are you sure it wasnt just travel (cheetah) form?
---
I dont believe any customization like this is in classic right now.
---
So far I have engaged in PvP only twice. Both times it was some much higher level Alliance guys trying to gank. Thankfully I have heals for days and they never check their surroundings for other Horde before trying shit.
---
I had a tough time deciding between horde or alliance, I think I chose right
---
Stop assuming shit, nothing about this conversation looks staged.
---
Are you me?
---
Holy shit that sword is huge!
---
You sure it was cat form and not travel form? because travel form is a yellow cheetah.
---
There is a version list above Play button in battle.net launcher. 
---
You just can buy subscription for her account in battle.net shop. No BfA required.
---
Well they were right about vanilla being way harder than Wrath naxx.
---
I Afked too long and the combat log was not there to check 😂
---
Laughs in european...
---
Sorry, F
---
Im level 24, entered the top part of Stonetalon. I've already done SFK. What would be a good route for leveling from here? I havent touched Hillsbad or Ashenvale. And I havent gone near the Razorfen's south of Barrens.
---
Yes yes. Communist countries like the Soviet union and peoples republic of China have never enslaved their people, invaded and conquered territories. All bad things through history are by capitalism, there is no nuance. Seriously seek help.
---
You’ll have to tame a pet with screech 2 to learn it and train your current pet. Not available until level 32 in thousand needles.
---
pepega
---
Is running a ret paladin or any sort of warrior worth it for endgame world pvp or should I just stay clear
---
Maybe the ones you personally know but 60/75% boards are not at all common lol. I’d wager 95%+ of wow players are using a standard keyboard.
---
Similarly, since “Take Screenshot” is an editable keybind, everyone has a screenshot button
---
\#showtooltip Sinister Strike
---
/startattack
---
/cast Riposte
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
Tough call. I guess I might start with threat and do armor after. If I lose threat and the dps or healer start taking damage that will cost way more mana.
---
Maybe that’s it, would like to see the real thing next time.
---
&gt;Definitely type B, by rushing levelling you're blazing the surface of the game and will burn out with little to do at sixty. Also why are people using questie and those type off quest help add-ons? It's literally like questing in retail if you use those add-ons, just read the text and figure it out it's so much more rewarding and enjoyable an add-on I like to use that breaks the paragraph of quest text down is immersion.
---
I find the levelling the worst part of the game though, nothing about it is appealing to me just a boring slog.
---
Playing a Mage in Classic is really hard. Since level 1 I have been having to drink almost every pull. I pull 2 or more and I am dead. Its horrible going into the mines, or trying to complete jest objectives cause mobs continue to spawn near and around you. 
---
Its been one hell of a frustrating experience. Its almost like you are forced to quest in a group but then the XP earned is reduced. 
---
Locks were a lot better once you get the imp at 4. Warriors were surprisingly pretty good. I could take on 3 or more early on from around level 4. Its cause you get more rage the more damage you take which helps in spamming Heroic strike. Rogues are alright but Hunters suck 1-10. You barely get off 2 shots till you have to melee them to death. 
---
But of all the classes the hardest was the hunter followed by the Mage. Those early levels are a nightmare.
---
Does this command also work?
---
/console WeatherDensity 3
---
Does anyone know?
---
This is European, Firemaw though :(
---
I guess so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
So I guess Thick Hide first and Feral Instinct later then.
---
I saw 2 groups farm the pirates in tanaris and they didn't seem to have any troubles waiting for respawns and there was definitely room for another one so I don't think that's true.
---
But unless you want to set a record for yourself or raid week 1 you don't have to do either, I'm currently 45 playing as a fire mage(ie impossible to aoe farm) and having fun just leveling via quests. 90% of the phase 1 content is the leveling content anyway so I don't feel like "skipping" that by aoe grinding.
---
yet only one gets any respect
---
Defias Brotherhood quest chain in Westfall. It's the first significant questline in the game for alliance, and it culminates in a quest to bring back the head of Van Cleef. The quest gives great loot for it's level so pretty much everyone does it. It's like a rite of passage for new alliance players. Most people will complete some, if not all of the prereqs before they've even thought about running the dungeon. Since it gives such great rewards it's a primary motivator to do the dungeon content.
---
In the early days everyone was looking for a group specifically to kill Van Cleef for this questline, rather than run the Deadmines in general. So they would say "LFG VC", "Anybody doing VC?" Etc - so they could get the quest done.
---
The terminology evolved organically before people had experienced all the other dungeons or settled on standard abbreviations. Before anybody even know about Dire Maul.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Layers until Phase 2 protect you more than enough.
---
Guaranteed ding right there.  I don’t care how far from the next level you are.
---
Lmao yeah we out here rich enough to buy skills twice.
---
I'm aware, but that's meta information about development not the current iteration of lore :p
---
The fool trained Scare Beast. HAH!
---
How? I’m lvl 17 and want to throw my pc out the window because it takes fucking forever to get anywhere.
---
I have like 4g at level 22. Dont think ill be getting a mount anywhere near level 40 unfortunately. Even as a tailor, i cant sell anything because other people are willing to give free stuff to everyone.
---
I apologize, watching again frustrated me too but I had already clipped it T_T
---
so much this
---
It's still the common term on the many private servers as well.
---
Tbh, I started feeling at lv 6 that something was up with the difficulty..seems easier now
---
Difference is that people doing this in BGs will be consistently mass reported and probably suspended. You can’t really report someone for going afk in an inn... they’re quite different.
---
Should all those options be occupied: scorpids, raptors and humanoids can yield okay results too.
---
&gt; 24 hours every day.
---
Ah so that’s the answer. 6 days of 24-hour play is far from healthy.
---
time to change servers. play on smolderweb. 0 queues all day
---
Yeah I know, but adding a trial right now would only make gold spamming worse, it's possible they will add it in the future but they haven't said anything about it yet.
---
Björk Björk Motherfucker
---
You were part of the 7-8 guys schooling the alliance for an hour?
---
They don’t even have fish names
---
Mmmm depends on the class and server type I'd say. And playstyle, to some extent.

It’s better than nothing at all, that’s for sure.

You level as shadow and can still heal dungeons as you level really well. You should go full healer later at lvl 60

Subjective opinion: both versions of the game have serious flaws and serious upsides.

Method said they weren't even going for World First 10 days ago.

---
&gt;In retail, the easiest content is literally-not-figuratively AFKable
---
Classic has that too. It's not a factor of classic or retail, it's a factor of can your group carry you or not. LFR can be AFK'd because some other player in the group pulls more than their own weight and the same will be true of classic really soon. People have already cleared MC with a few character below level cap and with random pieces of gears. Are you telling me you think if teh same type fo player form an appropriate level group to re-clear MC next week, they would nto be able to carry some AFK players?

DM will always be Dire Maul to me, but then I never played Alliance, so that makes sense.
---
Level 27 atm and Im just like you. I don't want to go too fast, but I don't want to spend 4  hours in a dungeon. So far i've experienced 3 types of groups : The nice one, where everyone or almost are actually nice. The neutral one where nobody talks even if you make mistakes, they just want to do the dungeon. And finally the one you've talked about, the one where people flame non stoo about wipes or dps. I'd say I've experienced it all equally.
---
Didn’t Method’s stream literally say “race to world first”?
---
Ret paladin is not amazing in the raiding, however it's totally legit in PVP. Warrior is good in pretty much anything.
---
Try your server discord. Sometimes they have class community channels.
---
You were able to get it to update exp gains on its own just from changing the texture?
---
Play on anathema it’s low pop
---
Guy who replied to you is very wrong. 2h axe and mace are very important to you, and you should aim to get the best weapon to last you for a long while. 
---
[This slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HyCiVeKMS9MDOHxEHyDH38i0q2kJD-3qjSMxFjTZk8k/mobilepresent?slide=id.g4540852442_555_387) should answer some of your questions and help you make more informed decisions while leveling. Make sure to check the end for the weapon progression. 2h fury to 36 *is* the correct answer.
---
Yes you can try it out for free. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/start
---
Cool make one for China and the USSR next
---
:( Thats a shame. I really wanted to try it out.
---
So the lowest of the stated range is recommended minimum I assume?
---
I just started and hadbt played in a few years. I had to reactivate and add a subscription to play.
---
I have this delay too, hopefuly it will go away when realms are less packed. I really hope its not intended, it will ruin the game for me

it doesn't take a whole lot of mechanical skill to no life dungeon grind 4 days of /played time in 6 days real time then press shadow bolt a lot for a few hours in mc

What server do you play on?
---
Lol, "sad to see". This is WoW. Alliance kill Horde and Horde kill Alliance.

If you dc and connect fast enough you dont have to go i to the queue and get your spot back in game

I was 31 mage with a 26 mage and we grabbed a shaman and rogue to help.  Respawns and silence were just too much for us
---
That's how PvP servers are.
---
Just had someone gift my lvl 13 warlock ass 1 good and it was the best feeling of my life

It does

Classic is sub only, no trials as of yet, the same sub will let you play both Classic and retail.
---
Prat
---
because he can't compete and is salty
---
Mate anything that has the word "gaming" in the name can run classic. It takes VERY little.
---
Didn’t have a wait timer on aetish it whatever, we did start playing at like 3pm yesterday so maybe everybody had fucked off to go eat linner, I dunno.
---
My friend and I walked to Ratchet and along the way we pulled about 12 bear shamans into a couple of horde, killing them—I couldn’t stop laughing. We also survived a warlock on the boot to booty bay.
---
Running through enemy territory is some of the most fun I’ve had. Also shout out to the warrior who saw us and was friendly
---
Too bad in my realm everyone is giving practically everything for free or barely above vendor value and you cannot make any money like that.
---
Is this a copy/pasta?  Lol
---
Send her to stone talon - it’s a nice break from the barrens
---
If its less than half the xp do they really go twice as fast?
---
Classic easy 😂
---
Why would you kill some one with rezsickness?
---
you're a madman and I love it. Do all the pservers tune things the same way? Or are the raid difficulties different for each?
---
We swapped...i went to the last oppened server before launch. Afterwards its too late, i only roll once...if they open 15new 30min after launch im not moving and wasting my play time.
---
I saw a couple Horde yesterday that were several levels lower than I. I waved at them, and went on with my day.  
---
When phase 2 drops, though? I'm getting my orc scalps...
---
While I personally share your view on when to engage in PVP, ganking lowbies is just a part of vanilla and always had been. I don't get the fun in it either, but then again, there are also people that install aim bots or wall hacks in shooters.
---

---
I'm the same. Today I'm gonna tank DM for the first time so I was reading up on it last night. It helps if someone in the group marks an enemy with a little skull icon so the dps know who to hit and which mobs to ignore that way the tank can hold aggro on all the mobs and you can focus healing just him.
---
The rate of your downvotes only indicate that you are an absolute bellend. Fucking scummy troll.

Yeah it only took like 3 dozen Zhevra to get 4 hooves, so pretty good so far.

Sometimes you can Alt f4 once you’re in character select and then you can log straight back in. Seems like a grace period in case of random disconnects.

Don’t actually just straight log out though, that will put you back in queue, you have to alt f4.

Yesterday while questing in Hillsbrad I got ganked by an Alliance group of 2 warriors and a Druid who yelled out “You ArE aN EviL KoRean” as they killed people. I laughed for quite a while.

Wow, it really is 2006 all over again. Prepare to be inundated with a load of people yelling dumb crap like: "RED IS DEAD!" and "THAT'S WHAT PVP SERVERS ARE &lt;insert expletive&gt;!" and "ROLL ON A NON PVP SERVER YOU FILTHY CAREBEAR!"
---
You'll get the more mid-range responses as well like "Everyone does it" or "It's part of the fun, don't take it too seriously, just do it back to them when you're high level."
---
You're also going to get the extreme rage nutters who will take personal offenses at you for even mentioning that ganking people lower level might be crappy and will continue to private message you with abuse. Those guys are fun.
---
Oh, and don't forget the smug troll responses that are going to revel in someone posting about it and promise to do it more.
---
At the end of the day PvP attracts a huge bunch of different people and a large number of them are on different points of the spectrum. Some just want to troll. For some it's the only way they can feel in control in their real lives. And some of them actually just like the competition and the immersion of engaging in a full on war with the other faction.
---
If you're going to play on a pvp server you've got to take this into account and accept it. There will be fun times and there will be frustrating times. If it gets too frustrating, go play an alt on another server for a bit.
---
Or do what I do. Let the hatred consume you, roll a rogue, get to 60. Watch PvP videos. Tweak your UI, obsess, practice and then mercilessly gank every single character from the other faction at every possible opportunity until the entire server promises to behave (spoilet: it'll never happen, but it's motivation)
---
Happy world pvp.

&gt;Sortbags+cleanup
---
This is working with Bagnon, although the button graphic is green for running the cleanup. Works fine otherwise.
---
Does that degrade your gear? Is that something I should use if I want to suicide quickly?
---
Feels. I rushed and jumped into the decorative boat at Menethil Harbor, thinking it was the boat to Theramore. Got completely stuck because the sides were too high to jump out from.

Nowadays everyone uses programs that allow you to send keystrokes simultaneously to all our game clients. 
---
Prior to software solutions existing the same was achieved by building a contraption that allows you to press a key on multiple physical keyboards, or by having the same wireless keyboard hooked up to multiple PC's receivers. This is where the name multiBOXING comes from, since initially it was one game client per PC.
---
I'll try that too... Wowhead seems to be my goto site for when I can't find something.
---
I've had 3 cracks at WC, every time something went wrong after beating verdan, eventually got all the hides but yeah 3 attempts to get the hides, still not fought the boss yet that gives you the quest.
---
How TF?!

One extra MC raid will not matter one bit when the next content comes out
---
Are the zones set up so that higher level Alliance players face off against lower level Horde because for me it's been around 80% higher to 20% lower.  I've seen multiple ?? level Alliance players in Desolace for instance and not a single ?? level Horde player or one that was even 5+ levels higher than me outside the major hubs.
---
NSFW tag this erotica
---
That's a funny joke
---
I have the FX504 and yes, it will run wow the highest settings perfectly. They laptops you and I have are overkill for wow :)
---
how can i tell if reached crit cap?
---
You're right, this is my biggest impression seeing these zones again for the first time in 10 years - the sense of exploration and adventure is so much better in these massive, but emptier than retail, zones. Retail is just so dense you don't really get that feeling that you're in a huge world. You're also hearthing or using flightpaths constantly in retail so you never get that experience of just running somewhere for 10 minutes.
---
No. World PVP was a major appeal of the game.
---
Silverpine or barrens for horde
---

This post makes me worried

Most bosses in MC were pretty much 1 mechanic
---
Maybe if you don’t worry so much it’s better.
---
Anyone know of a good fishing AddOn? I used to use Fishing Buddy and loved it, but it's listed as "unknown" on willitclassic.
---
I’ve never known a worrier to get too far, they’re busy having internal battles
---
Its a catch-all term for specs that aren't deemed "acceptable" in raids. So things like ret or prot paladin, feral druid DPS, etc.
---
I think WoW will be better off if we have both snowflake and non-snowflake versions.  If the people who want everything easy have somewhere to go, then they have less justification for demanding that classic be dumbed down in order to cater to them.
---
If we care purely about player numbers, classic will eventually get wrecked, because the majority are not going to want this type of experience.  As much as I dislike elitism in some respects, it also goes with the territory here.
---
Damn, I found a friendly tailor who made me 4 from my 24 linen. I just got my first drop at 16, and it was an 8-slotter.

You’re probably a bit biased unless you’ve pvpd on both factions already.  Ive gotten ganked by higher level alliance or 2v1s multiple times already

U seem like a very intelligent person.
---
Back in the days, grinding was pretty normal... Doing dungeons 2-3 times as well. I can understand that people are not used to it any more, but I kinda like it.
---
Don't feed the trolls.

I mean, many heroic 5 man boss are technically more difficult than a classic raid boss if you don't overgear it to make it all trivial...

As an offhand (unless you are lucky with green boes) up to lvl 39

I was looking to farm the Tiny Crimson whelping from the Whelps in wetlands, but just realized in vanilla they were added in patch 1.13 so are these not in classic at the moment?

Very true! Cat form is awesome for traveling!

My first group wiped in RFC. Nobody got angry, ragequit or argued. We just laughed. That's the kind of experience I appreciate.
---
You find a Mage Trainer
---
Yep. Come play with us if you used to. We still have plenty of people from there.
---
True lol
---
No idea . I haven't tried it
---
Huh?
---
Common for all classes:  
---
Being hit chased by mobs that gave up on chasing the player who aggroed them.
---
You can also go Warlock right?
---
It's when the new content comes out, Phase 2 is Diremaul? Not sure
---
Sorry for the answer since im horde I somehow assumed youre horde as well. u/KonigTX replied your answer about melee weapons but it is important for a warrior to also have a bow and some arrows as they will be handy in tanking dungeons and pulling mobs from clusters
---
Are you talking about in raids? They take enough damage in raids for it to not matter. In 5 man content though its certainly true.
---
Right? I got a 2 bags in the starter zone, and my first kill outside of the starting area I got a green dagger with stamina, which was perfect for a baby warlock. I felt like I won the RNG lottery!

True, retail encounters are way tougher. 
---
But if Apes are so unimpressive, then how come they were miles ahead of anyone else competing with Apes?
---
Why because of some 'duel event' on the beta, fuck off.
---
So that means it isn't a change? That's not how it works.
---
We are working on that, should be temporarily fixed by using `/reload` in the chat. Also make sure you are on the latest version (4.0.13 currently), it includes some fixes for the desync and other stuff.
---
Only problem I see is that you are both competing for the same items.
---
Is he currently playing WoW Classic? If yes which server.
---
It’s not that bad. I could quit anytime...
---
I went to a new server recommended by Blizz opened hours before launch. Logged in on launch without issue and leveled to lvl 20. Next time I got on it was queue city. This is on Blizzard as far as I'm concerned.
---
Well they are. I helped some dude out by providing mats for 4 wool bags. He got  quite a bit of skill ups and was happy
---
How so?
---
I have to take it? Like direct it toward myself?
---
Big pull in RFC? 😅👌
---
90%
---
I bank every alliance I see. But only once. Then I’ll /now and share mobs with you but I gotta get my one in first
---
When someone disconnects they have a 5 minute grace period to rejoin instantly. If you're seeing your number go up, that could be it.
---
[I had a very similar thing happen](https://i.imgur.com/D8IEVLJ.png)
---
I made the swap to skullflame no que and i can actually play intead of waiting for que until bed time
---
Low in Classic is more than high in retail. I don't see any reason to think any of the servers will die, Blizzard has been very conservative in adding them.
---
Do you have to use money to get any new abilities
---
The game was designed to be very casual friendly, and it really is. It only looks hardcore in retrospect because of the state of any other MMORPG at the time.
---
I noticed by accident (dying xD) that sometimes it didn't reset. That was the key factor to solo him since he spawns 2 extra adds at 40-50% hp, so if you vanish in that window he doesn't spawn them
---
LOL I just did that hides quest. I got 4 in the dungeon group, but it took me hours of solo farming outside the instance to get the rest. I went up half a level during that time though!

Blizzard name changes players if enough people report them, which happens all the time on RP realms. When i was 12 years old in tbc i used to make meme characters on RP realms and had them force changed all the time.
---
There are threads of people whining about it on RP realm forums all the time, too. Some times they try to get their 'plight' upvoted on reddit, but people immediately tell them to fuck off the second they realise they're trying to keep the name Biggiesmalls on an RP realm.
---
While I agree for the long term effect. I was the kind of person that never enjoyed the party atmosphere and would rather be playing wow. Got plenty of socialization in other areas of my life.
---
Nobody they hosted/promoted got any of the WFs so they already lost, yet method is still advertising it like there's still a race.
---
They've just been using the WF term to pump up their viewer counts and it's pretty embarassing to do that when none of the people they hosted/promoted were even close to getting any of the WFs.
---
Most probably because pvp servers in EU are all significantly Horde favored so you tend to bump into more of them...
---
He's hot.
---
How do you get that to record? It just takes a screenshot for my windows 10 version.
---
Yeess. YEEESSSS!!! The weak are leaving! Shorter queues!!!!!
---
Separating IC from OOC is imperative to a RP community. I won't get upset if you RP a racist, it's only an issue when it bleeds into IRL.
---
Thanks, that what I was thinking too. I'll talk to him today.
---
These are adorable! Thanks for sharing your method + recipe, I would love to try my hand at making some. 
---
Very well made, look tasty af! Awesome!
---
Wife and I kind of cheesed this by having one person abandon the quest, the other share, and then again but for the other person while we were out there next to the boars.
---
Resets the timer, basically gives you an extra three minutes. :)
---
...post the name?
---
What quest helper is this?
---
Very cool drawing! Made me smile.
---
Agreed, but voices of #nochange tend to be louder than voices of reason
---
God damn you're such a narrow thinker. Quit sitting inside your small world and open up man.
---
I just used wowhead.com
---
Or just use the unstuck feature in the help menu. It'll kill you and put you at the nearest gy. I use it to level more efficiently. It's very useful early on because no or little rez sickness.
---
Fair enough, just assumed the mobs would only die twice as fast or a bit better , but with running etc was surprised it would be half the time to do it all.
---
Ok.

---
Healer, tank, eight AoE species DPS and just nuke down everything before it hits the clothiers.
---
Yeah, probably a good idea. I’ve never played WoW (other than up to the free cap in retail like 4 years ago) and I wanted to start playing Classic when it was fresh just to experience what it would be like. 23 hours into my first character already... probably need a brake check :P
---
First week, had to be done, been waiting for this for years. Inevitably slowing down this coming week, unfortunately
---
I played some during WoD (yes oof), and playing Classic is just another world. This is the WoW I've always wanted.  I'm excited to play.  To not only adventure as characters, I've never played but to get back to General chat so I can laugh my butt off with great freaking people.
---
Theres nothing more exhilarating than when a level 32 human warlock storms into ratchet and starts dropping people and suddenly you have a 30 man impromptu raid group trying to take him down. That shit is a blast.
---
You can arms tank for a while. But the sword board prot tree will be needed eventually.
---
Haha not quiting! Just ment it like, no more reddit for me because i feel so far behind, when really i am enjoying it more than almost every game ive played in the last 10 years !
---
Change server?
---
“You think you do...”
---
I do kind of feel like I shouldn’t have gone back...
---
Damn you Chromie.
---
Questing is your primary objective til level 60. There should be quests around the areas outside ironforge. Look for those and do em.
---
Play on a low/med pop server?
---
I realize this question may have been asked before, but as someone with an ancient WoW account (who doesn't even have the Battle.net launcher), can I revive my WoW account and download *only* classic? Retail does not seem to quite be what I'm looking for, and I have a potato PC, so the less space it requires the better.
---
Absolutely, you can spec entirely into arms and use a 2-h. And when you tank for your group, take out a 1-h and shield. You don't need to spec protection to tank before ~50 or so
---
It seems that this only appears for ppl who have not created a character yet
---
If you want a reliable unit frames add-on that's minimalist and easy to use try Pitbull.  I used xperl for years on retail and it never worked right.  Too much fluff and flash.  Pitbull gets the job done just as well.
---
They have an unstuck feature but it's in the help menu. It kills you now though.
---
Yes I know. Everyone is really helpful! I wanted to ask him but I was busy healing and later I somehow forgot about it. I just remembered now when I saw this thread.
---
The name being......?
---
Classic WoW isn't too complicated, there are a lot of obscure items that might help, but its very simple.
---
Take quest -&gt; Finish Quest -&gt; Level Up
---
When you run out of quests move to the next zone that is close to your level (might need to look online or ask chat). Or, grind mobs. You don't need to do dungeons while leveling up, though it is recommended. Easiest class for beginners would probably be hunter.
---
Some people being better than you ruined the game?
---
No u
---
It’s possible yes, but I would still use a 1h and shield because majority of defensive stance abilities need a shield and if you aren’t above the level of the dungeon or have great gear you probably will be taking a ton of damage
---
Guess it’s kinda my fault but I have a level 30 char on Gehennas and I really don’t want to play on low pops.
---
kinda sad, like when you say you're going to run a marathon but end up walking most of it.
---
I stopped buffing people. The same isn’t being returned anymore. People are getting greedy and selfish, therefore I as well.
---
I think all of you should reroll on a new server.
---
Wait, how is rolling on a server that isnt overpopulated not an answer?
---
I've somehow managed to avoid any big queues. Just by pure luck I think😂
---
I think you've been considerably lucky.  I've had several quests that I had to kill 30 mobs just to get 5 drops from them.
---
Change server then until your main server calms down...
---
A sub is $15 a month,you could just pay for one month and see if you like it. If you don't you could just cancel.
---
When guildies logged in Last night they said they only waited an hour, which i a major improvement since launch.
---
Except he wasn't racing at all.
---
You can't make fun of other people's logic when your seems to be non existent.
---
I hope no one from my server sees this. The fishing rods sell like hot cakes.
---
So what's the point then? Why should I continue the grind to 60 if there's no challenge?
---
Aww man, feeling kind awkward about all the untethered Succubi running around.
---
Interface&gt;Status Text
---
Pick either number, % or both. Only will show it for your character though in classic.
---
I forgot, how silly of me, of course gaming is about gatekeeping and not just playing the way you want, but making others feel bad for not playing the way you do.
---
Some guy in accounting currently has that ;)
---
Every night elf got PTSD, it's a rough life for a lvl 6 NE who wants to hop to Dun Morough
---
It'll get fixed at some point... but WoW was always about learning game mechanics and adapting them to suit your needs. All the talk about penalizing people for doing exactly what people in Classic did when they found bugs is kinda funny.
---
ur name what
---
That's kind of my point: mythic should not exist, dungeons should be difficult by default
---
30
---
Lmfao this isn't legit classic, it's not that hard.
---
If you are level 42 im guessing you are not getting stuck in ques.
---
&gt; In classic, pulling more than one mob at the same time is very dangerous. 
---
Delusional if you think this tbh. Can literally watch the world first 60 pulling 8 mobs at a time aoeing them down. I'm watching netflix right now while I level and it's no more difficult than retail, in fact it's easier because I get to pay attention to my show after drinking every 2 mobs.
---
Good meme
---
2 is true.
---
Let them... What's the point doing all this rush? Im enjoying leveling and going out of my way to get that item that i want and leveling my professions... Still lvl 26 and proud
---
Yes! When you download the Battle.net launcher and have an active WoW subscription, you will be able to download Classic or Retail or both
---
No, I don't.  You are probably mistaking me for another person.
---
The standard “we didn’t get it so we really didn’t want it” response
---
It's wasn't when I creat the caracter.
---
Yes, it's a separate install for classic. Only 4-6 GB iirc
---
I honestly don't see why he even has to defend himself. The competition was first to 60 and he used what he could and was given from the game. Everyone else is able to use layering the way he did, so he didn't have any advantage over the other competitors. If you can, use it.

---
Mooooom, they are having the wrong kind of fun!
---
There aren't "worlds" like Runescape. There are servers, and when you make a character on one server it stays on that server. There's no switching servers.
---
There's 2 ways to pvp.
---
Every Server: Click on your Icon and toggle pvp
---
PvP Servers: PvP is always active
---
Case in point.  Can't say a thing without idiots like you coming and picking a fight.
---
Yeah, I believe you need the battle.net desktop app but from there you can download classic wow and it is completely separate from retail
---
This guy still thinks its about achieving level cap.. go back to retail.
---
I’m pretty sure Blizz is testing the waters and it won’t stop with just WOW classic.
---
the sense of pressure by having completed quests or full bags to unload makes my soul itch. I cant take it, i have to have that release. IDK how you lasted this long.
---
Learn how to Remote Desktop from your phone to jump in the queue early. I play on a full server and it’s the only way to get in the fame after 1pm
---
Not sure about the gear, it probably does. It does however take note of your location for Blizzard to investigate/fix the spot where you got stuck. My friend got a temp ban for abusing unstuck back in the day.
---
Ya, quests will naturally lead you into other and more diverse zones.  You also can look up other 10+ zones and take trip to get there! As far as guild in early levels, they are helpful for finding people to complete hard quests or instances.
---
That's because classic sits at the point in time before they ruined the leveling experience. Basically, there's challenge in every fight and every quest makes sense within the game mechanics, instead of being a "story exposition" and "plot development" thing with some gimmick mechanics. Also the downtime between fights and walking, as well as just the sense of rythmn and learning your class as you play, it all contributes to this feeling that people are getting back on with Classic.  
---
Essentially, having to manage resources and actually have some kind of challenge on killing mobs makes the leveling experience really rewarding and it's something Blizzard lost completely the track of since WotLK. IMO that's the point where the game got ruined, because the leveling experience is such a big deal for me.
---
Mining also makes money, though.
---
Grob Mob for life!
---
With blizzard, frost nova, and arcane explosion you can reliably solo many mobs at once, might take a bit of practice.
---
To me mage is the only answer to this question.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Windows 10 by default has recording. In fact you can even record the last previous 30 seconds by default IIRC.
---
Thanks. Welcome to the family.
---
I know how to do that. So say I was in school and at around like 11AM I start queueing, what if I get in before I get home?
---
Jesus, shut up
---
I haven't found any addon yet, please help us guys

Nick Saban 4 prez
---
I don’t remember all the steps to post it here, but there was a post yesterday that showed how to auto ignore chat channel invites. You can try and look for that post or tinker in the options menu.
---
Yup. Basically the people have learned the mechanics inside and out and that knowledge is available with the a quick Google search to anyone now. No one is really rediscovering the fights.
---
Thank you for this! Now I can change your code to work with conjured food and water to earn my kindness points back!
---
If only WoW were a single player game and your server choice didnt matter.
---
Just find the setting in Details to no longer track ilvl and you’ll be good to go.
---
It will slowly get better as the days pass. Until then do yourself a favor and setup remote access.
---
People are still noobs but now they have streams where a few hardcore spends 700 attempts perfecting a strategy most others will copy or never get to play. Addons gets perfected for bosses and it’s much easier to create a raid and filter out noobs with achievements and such. Content have “learning” mode now. Many guild raids are still a shitshow in retail today. Only the very top guilds have improved much.
---
Thanks. Well, I'm recording our game sessions anyway, so I might as well post them (after editing out the boring stuff :-)
---
Into a "clearing 2h after release"-raid. Any other raid will take whatever spec you might play.

TL;DR: a guy from the forums compiled a list of all dungeon and raid changes from 1.1 to 1.12. They are extensive.
---
It was supposed to accomplish the magic of conveying an opinion.  
---
Also, I don't see an award?
---
Correct, and extra couple epics in non essential people will be irrelevant
---
Are there any guilds out there who are going to raid without reading guides? I didn't play vanilla and would love to go into the raid blind.
---
The monitor maybe?
---
No, Blizzard has hard-capped it.  You can shoot at things from 40 yards, but nameplates don't appear until ~25.
---
Not very intelligent. Just more intelligent than someone who goes to a specific subreddit for a specific interest and goes even further into a specific post about a specific topic within said subreddit just to try and troll for internet points or something.
---
If you feel like you need questie, dont get it. If you dont need it, you dont need it. So dont get questie.
---
That's what I use on retail and is working perfectly for Classic for me.
---
What level are you that you almost have 2g already?

Or overcrowded scarecrow fields, or overcrowded Murloc camps...

I keybind auto run to my mouse wheel. Big QoL improvement.

So much so that retails raids are mechanics vomit that require an autist to memorize, taken straight from FFXIV savage.

Check this guide: pretty comprehensive and goes through leveling and where to put talents and how to use them. Totally recommend
---
Or, just use unstuck under "Help" and "Character stuck", it kills you and teleports you to the closest graveyard.  
---
Speedrunners (as in, speedlevelers) use it to travel quickly when getting ahead of the herd.

---
There's Pantheon in development, which seems to hark back to EverQuest quite a lot.
---
Definitely Defias armor especially if you have the full set. The five piece set gives you an additional 10 AP which is equivalent to about 10 Agility.
---
That's pretty cool
---
There was a lot unknown about the game when it was first released and there was very little youtube, no twitch, and not even reddit was around. A website like WoWhead was very very limited. 
---
Figuring out an encounter for the first time was rough back in 2004 it was easy after that first kill. Nowadays it is easy.

Yeah this is not 2004 anymore. If your enjoyment of the game depends on what other people do then mmos aren't for you.

Yeah, I’m liking it on thunderfury! Only ran into a couple of dicks so far while waiting to kill zalazane, fizzle, and the razor mane dude in the barrens, but everyone else has been great
---
People end up with a bunch of mats at some points and just give shit away as a means to level the profession, rather than vendoring the items, or enchanting the same piece of gear over and over.
---
Let's talk in a few months :)
---
Mage does this probably the best. Other classes can do it too, but lack the extreme utility that the mages kit offers.
---
I don't think the game will allow that but either way can't you do a windclip/conc macro by just trying to use both of them since they're mutually exclusive abilities that can't be used at the same time similar to how druids do travel/aquatic?
---
*accept quest on far west side of the zone*
---
“So where do I need to go to complete your task?”
---
“East.”
---
We definitely do. It's a quicker way to do the slog for the Nth time.
---
I considered doing that, but Mograine just seems like the perfect server and so I don't really wanna play on any other one.

---
I spent a good 3 hours pvping in hillsbrad with a friend yesterday. It was amazing. That world pvp is what I miss.
---
Just need to make sure I don't get too distracted by it and get to 60 relatively quickly!
---

---
This is what I found
---
I do agree that 1.4 MC was harder and would require a couple more hours to clear. Apes would have to farm a few dungeons to replace their green leveling gear before attempting a 1.4 MC.
---
That’s not how that works at all, a player being suspended temporarily doesn’t necessarily mean that resources were taken away from improving the stability of servers. A random customer support employee or an automated system that carried out the suspension has no bearing or influence on how stable the servers are
---
The info also wasn't as available as it is now. Add a general lack of experience on top of it and yeah, everything will look harder.
---
Sorry for your loss, grats on your gains. 
---
Keep truckin' bud. Take the good weeks with the bad and enjoy your solo grind (=
---
I know there's lots of bag addons available, but is there one that preserves the normal look of individual bags but gives a search bar like retail has? Or at least has the option to? I really don't like seeing one big inventory.
---
Pretty sure I saw that option in TB.
---
There's nothing disguised about it
---
&gt; after every 2 l 3 days.
---
?? 
---
Once. Only like 3 servers have meaningful queues anymore. If you wanna play on the meme streamer servers it's your own problem.
---
SQUAD F, FOR FUCK'S SAKES, STOP PLAYING BEJEWELED!
---
Walter, Walter, what's the point, man?
---
Yeah, Walter, what's your point?
---
Walter, what is the poin-? Look, we all know who is at fault here - what the fuck are you talking about?
---
What the fuck is he talking about?
---
Am I missing some setting or something or is there no way I can freely move my windows around like social, character, spells, tradeskills, etc. If I'm in a group and want to check something the window always pops up covering the group window, now I'm frantic bc I'm the healer and worried someone might have got an add or something and I don't want them to die because I was curious on something.
---
Additionally, can I make group bars a little bigger and change color of mana? It's kinda dark on my screen and hard to see.
---
Maybe they thought they were "helpful"?

In gaming terms something that's all but forgotten is considered a dead game. So let's not be pedantic and leave the semantics aside. 
---
I didn't ask for your recommendation. I'm a 28 year old man with a wife and son and what I do with my spare time is my business. Time enjoyed is never time wasted. 
---
So you can keep your 'honest opinion', soak it in lube and lodge it firmly up your pompous arse. 
---
Nobody playing the game is deluded. Video games are there to be enjoyed and it's every individuals prerogative to spend as little or as much of their time on this earth playing them.
---
Kindly gtfo
---
Mostly not, just arseholes lol
---
I think you pulled the wrong thing from that quote. The Scarlet Crusade is not affiliated with the Alliance
---
No need. It will all but be forgotten in 2 -3 months
---
Can someone explain what’s going on with anz?
---
So what was your name?
---
I don’t understand.
---
Sounds like a gnome player alright
---
I'm leveling a paladin and that gave me hope. I will see how things will be going once I get to 60, but probably will end up switching to holy at some point
---
 Not even commitment just a shit load of no lifers. World first on a 15 year old game? You. Have. No. Life.
---
How was tips not going for world first? He was clearly very serious to people in his guild about leveling times and what not. Is he just backpeddling so hard since they lost and it wasn't even close?
---
Sure things were nerfed. But the game was hard back in the day, due to lack of knowledge of MMORPGs. Today, we have all sorts of MMORPGs and have a good know of a MMORPG  mechanics. Top it off, we have SO many more guides now than ever before. Of course the game is going to be a lot easier now.
---
Just run the item through the AH and compare it to vendor pricing. I vendor most grey items from trash mobs but even then some grey pieces such as weapons or armor can fetch good pricing right now.  For an example, grey shoulder items can fetch a better price on AH then vendor.
---
Dodge miss parry
---
Just a conjecture, but did this happen at Darkshore?
---
no it's about auto attack weaving and dot uptime
---
For me it's more all of the trash talking they were doing at the very start of the streams and also some of them had poor sportsmanship when they lost. The GM is a class act but he wasnt in the world first race.
---
Ah. Sorry to hear. That does suck. Hopefully recovery goes well.
---
Hahahahahhahaha
---
To be fair to Blizzard they gave players substantial warning that full servers would have excessive queue times. My guild chose to move twice with the announcements of new servers, whilst it was quite frustrating with name reservations needing to be done multiple times but none of us have had to sit in a queue for longer than 10-20 minutes at the absolute peak times
---
Not an add-on :)
---
You CAN, but there are massive costs to doing so without cause. At least in my state.
---
In real terms, something that's all but forgotten is simply that - all but forgotten.
---
Not unlike several other ancient MMOs that are still alive and kicking, but they're just not talked about much.
---
As for your bitter and emotional response to my opinion, I must thank you :)
---
Are you maxed level? Need to visit the trainer?
---
On EU theres not a single low , every server is full and 2 medium
---
I do this as the Tauren, come up, and say that they've caught a cow and follow them around. It's hilarious.
---
«the inquisition would like to know your location»
---
yeah I was looking at 144hz screens :X
---
I have already contacted the blizz HQ with screenshots and all. Dont try to excuse your way out of this.
---
If your healer is really good then he will be yelling at you to wear the right gear so that he can stop wasting so much mana healing you
---
I tried that but unfortunately it will just try to use the first ability in the macro.
---
How in the hell... I just dinged 55
---
Hillsbrad is just a bad area, that's pretty much where people go when they're 60 to gank. Give it some time or level somewhere else
---
Yes I get mad whenever a corporation takes advantage of an event.
---
Yes?  What a dumb thing to ask.
---
Just speaking my mind. If that's pointless - then so be it.
---
#showtooltip attack
---
/targetenemy
---
this is what i'm using but what do i put so i hover mouse over target and it automatically selects that target? its easier to tank with
---
So like i said its wishfull thinking
---
Hunter weapon!!!!!
---
Some of us have played multiple private servers, though, as well as having multiple 60s in vanilla, so people telling us we're doing it wrong is odd.
---
Awesome!! Thanks man, I really appreciate the help.
---
Isn't retail WoW a huge cash cow? It's not really a screw up if it continues to make boat loads of monies is it?
---
/use \[@mouseover,help,exists\]\[\] Spell Name
---
Is a lot more efficient and does exactly the same.
---
Also the author asked for an addon to heal without clickin, which sounds a bit weird I don't see how it could even work but a macro requires an input.
---
But maybe the author doesn't know how to ask questions which is also a fair assumption.
---
Yeah you wouldn't want someone with 15 years of experience in your group. No one who is new would call it VC. VC stems from NA vanilla, it's from the quest chain to kill Van Cleef. I didn't see DM referring to dead mines until I played on a pserver in like 2015. I played on multiple servers over the years and all throughout vanilla, bc, and wrath I never saw it referred to as DM.  It stopped being referred to as anything after LFG just auto formed groups in the end of wrath, but it was always VC when using general chat to form the group. On Smolderthorn, Frostmane, Bronzebeard, and Destromath it was always VC. All the people getting butt hurt about it either didn't play vanilla or they're EU or something.  Part of me calls it VC just because that's what I'm used to and always called it. Part of me calls it VC because I get to watch people like you make a big deal about it and get all worked up.
---
Also less tanks dcing every fight cause dsl internet
---
I don't think anyone has ever said you need pre bis. It's just that as a raider showing you are willing to play the game outside of raiding to get the best possible gear to make the raiding as smooth as possible, is a good thing to show. So I'm sure people will continue to use it to weed out players. You don't need it with half decent players no, but rooting out bad players isn't always easy. It's a lot easier to root out underdedicated players, since you can just look at their gear, and that takes out a lot of the bad ones too.
---
Just want to piggyback here to ask a quick question... I don’t seem to get alot of gear drops. Yesterday, I was farming for a while and gained two levels. Through those two levels, I only got one upgrade in gear. Is that normal or just bad rng?
---
Chromie will remember this.
---
Ok, if it's not our business why post on here bitching about a forced name change?
---
Yes hello have i reached the Ordo Xenos? We have a situation
---
Which could be acquired via enchants right? Lol
---
It is buggy and doesn’t account for everything. It’s good enough to get you through for a while but trails off by 40.
---
I’d suggest using something like joana’s guide, zygor or something similar if you want to follow.
---
if you cant do what they did then its hard, 95% of the playerbase wont touch mc for awhile
---
Go for it
---
This right here. How can they be mad at all the people who resubbed to play classic. Exactly what you said hopefully brings more content to main game, while possible a future of tbc and wrath.
---
Sorry I didn’t take into account the people who broke blizzard’s rules and went onto a private server. My bad I guess -.-
---
It should. This is second surgery this year. Had back surgery in Jan. That was worst imo.
---
?
---
They're kinda meh but I don't really care because in reality it doesn't change anything that I'm doing. Makes the game seem kind of boring to outsiders though when all the big streamers are just grinding dungeons badly and stuff though.
---
They MC'd a mob in UBRS (or LBRS can't remember) to give them fire res. And 1.12 has the bosses nerfed a bit, along with new talents. Not that it's hard, but I didn't think the numbers would be there either as a fresh 60.
---
Woods would probably not attempt it on a serious level method did. That's the difference.
---
Imagine using headphones with your PC in 2019
---
It’s like camping out for a week to see Star Wars. Everyone sees it the next day or two later with no crowds and walks out like, meh that was kinda cool I guess.
---
The bigger picture meaning hes a streamer and that makes his behavior a positive experience? Because thats all that ever comes out of his white knights is that hes -trolling- and hes -not really like that-
---
You can watch it unfold, I believe its all recorded. I doubt he has already written up a guide about it. Check for vods and post them here.
---
I think he expected his pre-classic hype would carry him a little further than it did?
---
I hope he drops his attitude though, because he will soon run out of people willing to play with. 
---
"I'm not the nice streamer/youtuber you might think I am". I've been in guilds with GMs like this before, yelling on teamspeak / ventrillo. I stayed in those guilds too long, but with the wisdom of age, I would not put up with this now. Dude seems like a real tool with an ego.
---
because i want to know it forced name change is a common thing
---
No name changes. Your name is your reputation.
---
I had hoped that after yesterdays MC and Ony kills the "too easy" crap would stop regarding retail.
---
I understand.
---
Both layer exploiting and this dungeon exploiting is awful and its ruining the game.
---
&gt; Would you have rathered the spent twice as long preparing the game from 1.1 and moving onwards? 
---
&gt; Private server players didnt seem to have an issue with that, so why the hell is there an issue now?
---
I am not a private server player, nor are most people who have returned to WoW classic.
---
That right here is the beauty of the game.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI
---
Good thing they have PvE servers.
---
Haha I've been doing that on pick up groups for quests. I also mark the poly target in blue. So many people still ignore it even after giving directions. So annoying when I poly a target and someone (usually a Hunter) hits it and breaks the poly/CC. Now we have to deal with 2 enemy NPCs that are 2 levels above us.
---
You could march to dark shore or just grind DM and mobs in red ridge.
---
So you're informed and still decided to buy into anthem and Fo76 bullshit? Hmmmm
---
You can shortly after blizzard but right now it’s almost impossible on a lot of servers due to the population. Even more so given your lower level you will have massive completion for mobs.
---
I'd look into the price of a greater magic wand, or google for a wand progression sheet. I play horde so I don't know what it looks like for alliance. But even with that wand you should be okay. How much are your spells hitting for? Spell ranks on your bars don't update automatically in vanilla, so you might be using low rank stufd.
---
These are fantastic!  Love it!
---
You'll have to stop back in town often to empty your bags, but welcome to free money!
---
It was a cool idea but poorly executed.
---
It is if your name is offensive
---
The dream.
---
And isn't one of them Zizaran who was only aiming for world first level 60 anyway?
---
As the saying goes "the candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long" meaning, never rush a good thing.
---
&gt; But if Apes are so unimpressive
---
No one has ever said that? Of course they're impressive. But the private server community pretending they're the best players in the universe are deluded.
---
The droprates of quest items in classic is fucking trash. But holy shit the adrenaline rush when you get the last item.
---
OR - your friends don't make impulsive decisions, and they stick it out. Then in a week or two you make a Reddit post about not being able to play with your friends because u decided to go start on a new server.
---
Apparently for some people, queue times are bugged and are showing the total queue number rather than your current position. You should still get in to the game but you won't have an accurate estimate til it's finished; this seems to have started earlier today.
---
Or just mail them to an alt as you will run out of bank space.
---
Nope, nothing like you said.
---
Preparation.. people would forget it if they won, failing they can refer back to a tweet.
---
They DID create the confusion with the way they promoted themselves the ways they did.

---
Ran a group with 3 shamans last night. Shit felt like retail.
---
whats that now? :)
---
BDO has a separate launcher, most people don't use steam.
---
To join a chat just type /join \[name of the chat\] and then to leave it same procedure but with /leave.
---
So for instance /join General and /join World. You can also use their numbers (usually general is 1 and world 4).
---
As for finding people to play with it's a bit tricky at launch a lot of players are so obsessed with getting stronger that they don't want to party thinking it will slow them down. Maybe try to find a guild or to just talk to people you'd be surprised by the result. You'll end up finding people with a similar mindset as yours and making new friends to play with.
---
Yes, algebra-wise it's the same statement, but if you'd made it to high school you'd know language is not black and white and there's lots of nuances to it.
---
No, I like the games because I think they're fun and I have an informed opinion because I've actually played them :)
---
We managed it earlier, it was something like 63k XP an hour at that point. You can pull the entirity of cath in 3 pulls if you eye gets good RNG and arm in 4. 
---
It's really hard to sustain sub 6min caths, but not that hard to do it in arm. Just run 2 warlocks, 2 priests, a warrior and 5 mages or something similar and to do cath quickly only clear the bottom, then eye the boss for every other dungeon mob to aggro and use the fountain to LoS them into a line.
---
Mom, toilet!
---
Yes - only potential consider is Server transfer as it was the only thing at 60z that’s still not confirmed though.
---
so u can only be disrespectful to someone if u insult them? good logic kappa
---
Gathering professions are easiest to make money with. Something you could use would be Herbalism and Alchemy.
---
You could also go double gathering.
---
Tailoring is good for bags and some gear. But a lot if the gear you won't ever use and you will pretty much make bags with it for end game content.
---
Enchanting is cool too but can be a pain to level up. But it is very nice to add extra stats to your gear.
---
When I first started WoW day 1 of vanilla I played a warlock and I did tailoring and enchanting. I was always broke until I hit max level and farmed my ass off for a few weeks. If you pick either of those you might want to pick a gathering profession for some extra income because you can sell the stuff you collect.
---
Although not as useful engineering is just fun.
---
I don't know why, but recording the screen with a phone in portrait made this better. Like it's some random freak show you hastily record.
---
Yeah it would be pretty painful, I would expect the speed and latency  and cost to be prohibitive. Even browsing web pages was terrible on the Panasonic offerings. I’m sure it will get better once new companies get the LEO sat rings up
---
&gt; The event is going under the name "Classic Race to Worlds First" 
---
and the main reason its going by that name is because thats basically what method is really known for these days.
---
I have checked your stream a few times today, but it is offline. Let me know when you are going  to stream, I would love to set up my UI like yours. Thanks.
---
Good thing he was clever enough to make an alibi in case of failure with that old tweet. Thinking ahead pays off?
---
I love it! Now I need to make an alt to just sit at the AH.
---
No mobility sucks
---
You know those things that those losers give us every time we walk by them? 
---
Yeah those are buffs.
---
 No i’ve changed it. Frost bolt hits 54-61 (rank 3) and Fireball hits 57-77 rank 3 also. I’ve seen both hit 100+ though.
---
Fire up that Thottbot boys
---
you can get the 2h hydrocane from viscous fallout in gnomeregan... equip and switch back to your usual weapon to renew the waterbreathing effect
---
You can do dark shore and/or red ridge.
---
If you read my post you'd have known that I have already done this. I am aware that at the time of the screenshot the pole was not equipped. I just took a screenshot of the spell that I was using.
---
Hmm, I know pservers had it but that doesn't mean much.  I work 2nd shift and don't notice a spawn difference between high pop at 9pm and low pop at 1am.
---
Is the dynamic spawn sever pop, layer pop, tapers off the higher zones you go or simply a higher than original constant?  Will it be adjusted for phase 2? 
---
Seems unlikely we'll get an official answer so all I know is if I go in a cave im bringing a party lol
---
I didnt clarify well but I was referring more to grinding and leveling. Healers can definitely group up for that process. 
---
 I myself recall throwing in the towel grinding as Holy during Vanilla and levelling the rest of the way as Shadow. Holy wasnt absolutely terrible by the difference between it and Shadow was noticeable.
---
They are functionally identical. Use whichever you like the look of more.
---
Dude, I'm poor and I need money. If it's a friend I could click greed but with random, he can get a 15% discount
---
Yeah. Had my guild group floating the spawns and killin the mobs for the quest while I was waiting at the top for 2 of spawns. It was great lol.
---
I started playing when I was 12 and I've now almost entirely switched over to Classic at 16, playing WoW Classic and listening pretty obsessively to My Chemical Romance, seems like the only thing that's changed between then and now is the year lmao
---
I couldn’t tell you  tbh. I don’t really care about or follow those kinds of guilds I had just heard that claim in wow chat.
---
Yes it's very useful in some situations. Basically you want to use expose armor if you have combo points on your target and want to reset the right. So you get off a stealth, sap them and then expose armor with a macro so you don't autoattack. Then you bandage or whatever, and stealth up again, now you can open on them normally with a big damage increase.
---
That's probably the only time it's really used, but when you do that, it's very nice.
---
Big hitpoint pool and a lot of drinking time eh? I find warriors always happy to pug up for quests .. more killing power than a druid for sure, but we can heal. So both sides get increased speed ..
---
I feel this in my soul hahaha
---
&gt;Also there are plenty of people running around
---
You can't really tell from just that. The way layering works is you'll only ever come across as many people as what would have been on an old realm anyway. 
---
The problems come in several months when people start quitting. Those low/medium realms may end up with a population too low to really function.
---
Do yourself a favor and dont go Firemaw, 12k queues are all you are going to get. Many regrets.
---
Look for a label that says PvP.
---
And there is a TON in the world worth doing, thats the whole point of the game.
---

---
Hard to say without seeing you play then, you have the elemental precision talent right? I'd just look into a wand upgrade and keep going.
---
The difference is that practicing lockpicking takes endless hours to max out, buffing and making HS etc doesnt
---
Nah, in vanilla beta we called it DM.
---
Lol everyone is poor.
---
My friends think so
---
Personally, I’ve just been vendoring all but the best boe items since people don’t really have the money at this point. AH is only getting minimal over vendor rates, so I don’t want to waste my time on the hassle. Give it a few months and probably a different story.
---
Me taking the names of horde gankers for when I hit 60
---
I've had people ninja and people on Kromcrush are so nice they assume they are just not understanding what is good for their class (was gear they could equip but wasn't any good). Such a nice community but I have been ignoring anyone toxic because I don't need that shit lol
---
It doesn’t matter now. Just level where you can easily kill mobs and have quests.
---
I'm 25 and kinda feel like it's going too fast. It's been so much fun teaming up with people and everything else about classic.
---
This is pretty much how it's been for a long time now. Min-maxxers are free to do their thing, don't get me wrong. It's just that you don't really need to in this game or any other MMO really. I think people lose sight of that when the community is quick to jump on how terrible certain specs are suppose to be.
---
For sure man
---
I mean if you suck it would take super long. I don’t imagine it taking me more than a month and a half with active play.
---
Pick a empty server?
---
^
---
The concept of WoW killers is so stupid, just like the co felt that WoW would kill another MMO.
---
Getting ganked by a Rogue you haven't ever attacked is a high possibility, yet it's still not guaranteed.
---
Now you lay a finger on an enemy rogue once, and it's certain you will get griefed for the rest of the day by that guy.
---
Source: I was the type undead rogue back in classic most people here are flaming about lol
---
Dont think anyone else is having these issues my man. You gotta recheck your stuff. Could be a hardware not software issue.
---
Is there a list of 'good' gear for a troll hunter somewhere? Not BiS but decent gear? I'm trying to figure out what to do for my professions. I was originally going leatherworking/skinning but know a lot of people who are doing that profession and I'm wondering if it makes more sense to go something I find more interesting and ask others to craft me gear. I'm trying to figure out if I'm going to shoot myself in the foot doing that since I know some gear soul binds on creation.
---
He named 6 zones of which 5 are alliance exclusive or at least pretty much irrelevant for horde. 
---
He's probably playing alliance.
---
i kinda wish age of conan had done it.  i very much wish that that game had had good content for the last 3-5 levels, but it just ran out before you hit max.
---
how horrible was that last sentence.  two double words!?
---
Yeah true it isn't 100% awesome but in general people are very cool
---
Any of the above are fine. Just save your cloth for tailoring and do it later or farm at 60.
---
Alchemy/herb is fine if you want to drop tailoring.
---
You’ll want to keep a bag of gear that isn’t str stam agi. So you aren’t constantly running out of mana
---
1) i think your keyboard is broken
---
2) i think your keyboard is broken
---
3) again, keyboard broken
---
4) idk, strange bug, guess its your keyboard
---
and with keyboard i mean: check your keyboard software, maybe some chroma shit and so on makes problems
---
That they are the difficulty level of Deadmines. There's maybe 4 actual bosses in all of vanilla WoW that are worth the name, and they're all in AQ40 or Naxx40.
---
Just enjoy being a noob and exploring things as they come! Part of the fun is how unknown everything is. Think of it as the wild Wild West and enjoy it all as it comes.
---
Why not ? The time really passes between these and so does technology. So you now have more choices how to service so many people and looking at the last two launches it seems they have worked. But hey, even some problems are fine. If there were e.g. an hour long queue or some lags I wouldn't say a thing, but this is ridiculous. As I've said, I can't imagine people with level 30+ or with friends and guilds to move, it's just not going to happen and they will more likely simply stop playing at all.
---
"My experience" reeeeeeeeeee. Fuck this sub. Im out.
---
Survival Hunters were the best pvp hunters
---
My worries about this is it doesn't seem feasible to not only have 25? people hit 60 within in 5 days but also get enough gear AND attunements to down all this raid content, plus hearing all of MC was first attempt with what had to have been no real preraid gear.
---
The first 60 was already shown to have exploited layering to level faster than any previous world record, private or original vanilla. So it makes me wonder if there was any other shenanigans going on.
---
These are not issues reported by anyone else.
---
Either troll or reinstall required.
---
Im level 14 ! :D
---
only have the chest piece, is tunic better in that case?
---
Everything works fine everywhere else though. It's just classic wow that's having these issues :/
---
Layer hopping and infinite aoe grinding
---
"FINISH HE--- oh, you did.  Okay."
---
Level 30? Your nuts.

You do whatever you can to change around your schedule so that you can wake up as early as possible (3am is probably the earliest) and you play from there until you have work/school/whatever. So basically you want to go to bed as soon as you get home(or do some normal stuff if waking up at 3am isn't difficult), wake up at 3am then play until you have to leave again.
---
It's entertainment for some people, if you don't like it why even go into a thread about him? You're sure on his nuts alot.
---
People new to classic for one, having a damaging taunt isnt really a thing for damage dealers in retail.
---
UHH UHH
---
I don't see any addon buttons just the following: https://imgur.com/UE5cm2i
---
You can setup the game to permanently ignore channel invites.
---
I have never experienced one of these. 
---
It's probably user end
---
Did you even read your own article? It says nothing about method, as a guild, participating. What it states, however, is that method, as an organization, has partnered with WSOE to produce classic race to world first featuring prominent streamers and content creators. The fact that a few members of method are participating does not at all mean that the guild does otherwise that would mean that some of my mythic + and raids were official method runs due to having one or two members in them. Your argument here just does not make sense.

No it's not !!

Using the stone has a 30 minute cool down and also lasts 30 minutes

Only of they're continuing with TBC after the last phase of classic wow.

Wow that's amazingly unfortunate. sorry man
---
It thought,fuck it. I'll give it a try. I made one so my character moved forward &amp; jumped every 3 minutes and i got dc'd... maybe fixed?
---
So.. is it you? Ya know, for just making shit up and putting it quotes as if OP said it? Did you know putting something in quotes doesn't mean you've quoted someone? Fucking moron.
---
And don’t make the same mistake I did. To learn the new skill ensure you use the new pet with the skill a few minutes until you see the notification that you’ve learned it. You don’t learn it as soon as you tame.
---
I am not trolling. These are legitimate issues.
---
Realm transfers bish
---
Most of your gear is going to come from raids/dungeons. Not having a prof isn’t going to kill you unless you min/max and even then it only lasts for a little while.
---
Just level what prof you want and be done.
---
I think they are very different, but there's also a ton of them and most players played on many different private servers. There are certain things that don't change and the majority of experience and knowledge is in those parts. Who cares which packs are linked and where they patrol if you know exactly how all the calculations work and you've applied them to uncountable situations already. The mechanics don't change much, it's the same game and things like Onyxia's breath being off compared to private is just a simple hurdle to overcome, they've done it a million times before. Guilds like Method are insanely good at the retail game, but everything in the past is in the past, they've done it while it was current content and then forgot again to focus on the new stuff. That's just never going to win from people who play hundreds of variations of the same content over and over again.
---
They're the exact same thing, just one is shorter. I use the second one and it's flawless
---
There’s a hidden second roll. That’s why he won it.
---
There are about 10000 players actively farming these specific zones right now. That's far more than the &lt;500 back when you played in Vanilla.
---
If you 2 are always playing together I would go elemental. A lot of the gear works for both specs until you hit high end stuff.
---
all i wanted to do was bgs.
---
Spotted the virgin
---
Thank you for letting me know, I'll stick it out next time
---
It used to have an arrow and full arrow option before they updated it. But now it’s gone.
---
How is your quest log so big?
---
Classic was hard
---
Thought this was a pizza thread.
---
Sort of a vague question, but this is my first time playing WoW and I was wondering what realm should I choose? Or does it even really matter?
---
Seriously I get greens for days. Enchanting is skyrocketing so fast from all the DEs
---
This one mage complaining about the Emberstone Staff drop rate in DM, it’s dropped 3/5 times for me.
---
That’s insane! Earlier this week I was signing into Mankrik it had a 4K queue, but only a 20 minute wait.  
---
I guess peeps on my server have short attention spans and log off often, lol.
---
I'm going to Stone tallon next. I always remember that being a shit storm of ganking.
---
Theyre on Golemagg

Pen and paper, but that requires a purchase

4 hours to level 30, Lmfao.

Level 12 represent! 
---
Been fishing, cooking, bandaging, mining, skinning, exploring, throwing out lots of PW:F and going around healing anyone getting into trouble fighting mobs - been a blast 😄
---
Maybe try "run on: w7" or older i dunno
---
Then dont, take the stuff for yourself and run the risk of getting kicked. Some people will call you a ninja and group kick you, some will let it slide. Your choice.
---
I rather hangout with you guys than any world first craziness people.
---
&gt; People who try to take that angle are talking rubbish.
---
Agreed 100% :-P
---
&gt; I can concede that people on EU servers might've said DM and that Horde players have no idea, but every NA server I played in Vanilla on Alliance side said VC exclusively. I'd never even heard DM until a few years ago in the private server world.
---
I played on Garona starting a couple of months after release until well into Wrath, never heard it called VC until after I server transfered.
---
That's because it wasn't "moving", it was abandoning and restarting
---
Might be a big noob question, but what's RFA?
---
Unique idea.
---
It's really up to your playstyle for the most part. I am not bothering a whole lot when it comes to targeting enemies I just use target the closest as keybind and click on the nameplate of enemies.
---
With that being said you can maybe look for addons to display more information on enemy addons if you want to.
---
As for macros as a Warlock there's most likely a ton of very useful macros for your pets I'm not aware of as I'm not a pet class player. But generally you'd might want to have some mouseover macros for your instant cast abilities so you can quickly put dots on targets or curses for example.
---
The most basic macro I tend to use is this one:
---
/use \[@mouseover,harm,exists\]\[\] SPELLNAME
---
Obviously you want to replace SPELLNAME by the name of your spell, you can also specify a rank if you want (For example Immolate(Rank 2) will cause the macro to specifically use Immolate rank2, if you don't specify the rank the macro automatically uses the highest rank you have learned. But be careful as your spells not used via macros won't be automatically changed in your action bar so remember to swap those when you learn new ranks (I tend to macro all my spells personally).
---
As for what the macro does it's quite simple. It uses the action (can work with almost anything, not just spells) on the target under your cursor so you don't need to click and then do your action over and over. This is particularly useful when you want to keep your target but still want to cast spells on incoming enemies for example a Fear or a curse spell. If you ever want to do the same for actions used on allies just replace "harm" by "help" in the macro, as a warlock you won't have much of those but you can still find use out of it from using crafted bandages to some pet targeted abilities etc.
---
Hope this helps.
---
He's resting his hammer on his shoulder!
---
ClassicAuraDurations and OmniCC together works wonderfully.
---
I want that but i want it to sound like phil from trailer park boys doing a bam
---
The game is exactly how it was. Raids weren’t as hard back then as they are today. The people clearing these raids are top players who have access to guides and any other information they need which was not readily available back then. No changes need to be made
---
It's too early. Give it a couple of weeks.
---
What does retcon mean?
---
Meanwhile I am still stuck in queue
---
Welcome to my life as a rogue lol!
---
What were the drops?
---
I feel like the best thing that can happen post-Naxx is class balance to bring the meme specs like balance druid up to a competitive level, and adding new layers of difficulty on these old raids. If there is one thing that retail is generally doing well right now it is the quality and mechanical uniqueness of raid bosses.
---
Are add-ons considered cheating or against the rules? And if not, what do some of them do?
---
Nostalgia.
---
How do I know how much I can DPS before the mobs agro will turn to me
---
Then say they're bored and classic sucks
---
Yeah, they'll actually have to get to 60.
---
Warriors are one of the roughest to level, solo, but hot damn are they fun at max level.
---
1.12 is heavily nerfes from when people were progging rag.
---
Fishing is all about the audio cue. Nice try noobs :)

I legitimately walked my dog during a BRD run when we took a 30min break. I don't even remember how far we got in the 5 hours we were there.

---
Its faater to just reset the instance, no mob competition
---
Remindme! 1 hour
---
People need to chill out. We’re in phase 1 still. There’s not even bgs yet.
---
Where's the video
---
Sure for now, but we all know the two merchants that really make enough money to buy a nation:
---
Kaja at Boomstick Imports
---
Mangorn Flinthammer at Ironforge Armory.
---
Mankrik had 4K queues on launch day, but since then are barely in the thousands at all if there is any.
---
If your healer has mana and you aren't pulling you should be pulling. It's not hard to keep threat on 2 mobs. Three is harder but doable (assuming warrior).
---
I'd be surprised if a layer was 13000 people.
---
I had 12000 as server size in my head, so this would tally more or less.
---
Dude unreal thank you!!
---
Without seeing the actual numbers, these changes don't appear to make the actual encounters much harder... certainly, the MC ones just appear to be changes about bosses and mobs resetting after wipes?
---
Shaman is a class with tons of utility in their totems, there's one that gets people out of sleep effects, one that gives mana, one that gives the melee windfury (impressive boost to their damage), etc. It can also self-ress from a certain point and it has a normal ress, so that makes for good wipe recovery. It's kinda mid-range as far as leveling difficulty. Ghost wolf is nice though for the extra movement speed, from lvl 20 iirc.
---
Warlock is perhaps also worth a mention. It doesn't have a lot of support abilities but it has some of the best, possibly. Soulstone can grant someone the power of self-ress. (So you can either give it to the tank to save himself or the healer for wipe recovery) You also have the power to summon (though it requires the help of 2 others). You also have some minor things like healthstones. Because of the pet the warlock is very easy to level solo.
---
What laptops?
---
Retard detected
---
Mankrik wife beater
---
I’m thinking about checking out this classic wow. As someone who’s never played wow ever, what would be a good class to start with?
---
They were very clear about racing to world first 60, when that wasn't going to happen Sco said ok let's focus on world first MC then, before they knew MC and Ony were down. I'd tweet about not being serious about it too if I got owned that hard. Look at the resources they poured into this event, and they weren't even close to 60 yet before all current content was already downed.
---
What did he drop?
---
Noob question, what addon is that (health bar and mana bar)
---
Just pick a lower population server and they're minimal/non-existent.
---
Same issue on EU. The first 6 or so servers that released are full, and people aren't willing to change due to friends/guilds/time investment. For that reason, there's queues of up to 12k and up to 10 hours with very little change, especially since many people are staying logged in using programs or commands to prevent an automatic log out. Every other server is pretty much an instant join and still have a medium-high population.
---
So much better off just not going there as Alliance, way too many horde there.
---
Bunch of weirdos. I'm loving the length. I'm barely level 15, and having so much fun walking around meeting people, helping dudes, especially with party voice comms in-game.
---
Enjoy the fucking game, you don't need to sprint to 60 and then what? Raid once a week? Psh. Enjoy it! You only get classic wow ONCE!
---
EEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
---
Now they just say they weren’t racing
---
I know that is the end goal, that's the problem.
---
I had this the other night. Dude was in Stockades running from room to room at half health when I had almost no mana. Group was confused why we kept whiping. Some tanks really need to chill out.
---
I think boars share a timer with bears. I did it twice with a group and once we started killing bears the boars popped up left and right
---
I don't mind the forsaken being evil, but I find it hard to take tauren serious as chillaxed nature loving spiritualistic culture while being allied with undead cannibals.
---
Tauren druid: We will try to apply the secrets of the resilient nature of the barrens to try and heal Silverpine forest.
---
Undead apothecary: Neah, we don't ne... hey... can we have those toxic spores?
---
Td: For healing?
---
Ua: Yes?
---
Td: Helps with spores.
---
Ua: makes new plague like a boss!
---
look at the hardcore player here, getting lvl 33 in 12 days
---
I think im the only one. Sorry
---
I’m definitely not an expert. I’m leveling shadow and can still heal instances up to at least ZF/Uldaman. It’s rally up to you. The wand specialization helps for sure.
---
Me too but it reminded me of our poker nights in wow. Either in a capital city with gold wager or during MC for fun
---
Ah yes the old classic "you have no idea how challenging and absurdly difficult it is to change this very simple thing about the game". They fucking developed it. They made layering. Are you telling me they cannot implement a simple fucking cooldown or lockout from how many time you can force change a layer by getting an invite? Because then they are fucking incompetent.
---
*Laughs in warlock*
---
“No lifers”? They do the exact same things in the exact same game franchise, except the one they loved didn’t have the money in it. I’m happy that the spotlight is on them now.
---
A lot of the nostalgia also ignores that a large part of the "difficulty" in early vanilla was that you simply didn't know shit about anything. Thottbot was a joke compared to wowhead right now, there was no dungeon guide and online resources were extremely limited. Now add that things were a lot less streamlined than they are nowadays (e.g. dungeons and raids didn't have a clear path, attunements were all over the place, etc.) and it could actually take you quite a while to figure out and do stuff that is now trivial.
---
My warlock in vanilla literally had a 1 button DoT macro. Lol
---
What are some of the best areas for leveling 20-25?
---
Just started in Ashenvale this morning but I get the vibe it might be a bit of a slog there.
---
Just play somewhere else, the solution to not having the queue is literally right there.
---
That’s their choice though. You can enjoy it without worrying about them. These guys have been playing Vanilla for years already. Rushing to be the first and fastest is what gives them pleasure.
---
Go 2h fury until 40
---
Oh shit, I read that doesn't work in Classic so I didn't even try. Stupid. 
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I think it really only impacts vendor pricing. You'll get a little discount on important stuff, like mounts, but there's plenty of time to get rep while on the 1000g grind for that. Play where it makes you happy!
---
People underestimating the lifeless. I wonder many hours they have played by now
---
Fantastic idea :p
---
Loving classic...but there are definitely some quality of life improvements I’d like to see them make that would not affect the overall spirit of Classic.
---
Nope. On stream last night he showed gehennas
---
Show me your inferno cape.
---
Thanks I'll give it a shot!
---
The damage and healing rotations are simpler (nonexistant even), the boss mechanics are simple if there even are any, the gear requirements clearly aren't there if you know what you're doing, and now even LEVEL requirements are being pushed. Clearly Classic raids have nothing on heroic retail, much less Mythic.
---
Out of topic
---
Ehh, it's more like the content itself is braindead easy.
---
Call Congressman Garrosh and tell him you want universal spellthcare!
---
^I'll ^^see ^^^myself ^^^^out
---
I fought through vanilla with my guild back when it was current. We cleared KT. I still play with 7 of my guildies from vanilla we have been playing private servers together since wrath-cata ish. I have a feeling that we're going to be so bored and go back to overtuned private servers.
---
/r/whoosh
---
They still have to gear 40 people
---
Saying something is not as great as something else is perfectly normal. It's the same statement.
---
I think most of their classes get their good stuff at least by lvl 20, so I guess you should play it a little more than that. Keep in mind that for some classes the spec may be significant to your experience and what works well depends on the situation (dungeon, questing, grinding, pvp).

---
decent enough idea, it could also be tied into retail, like at the end of the next expac everyone gets moved to the alt time line (though tbh they should keep classic servers up)
---
All I remember is my group of friends tried it out and got sick of the gankfest when we got in our teens or so. This was right after one friend had paid like 50 bucks for a wooley mammoth mount or something weird like that.
---
BIG MONEY SALVIA IS HERE!
---
No offense ok  
---
But WoW players are the worst casuals ever made ussed to the most simple of the WoW patches that is already the most casual of the old-school MMOs  
---
You can't even tell a guy to stop messing arround and do their job as healer/tank/dps or they get offended and start saying random bullshit.  I hope most retail players stay and just learn  how MMOs used to be but really, it is worse than I expected and I had my standards low. I expected at least in pve for people to be competent. We are talking about lvl20-30 quests that should be done with your eyes closed.
---
I thought he was making a joke about lvl 30 being too low for STV. At least on pvp servers.
---
The real problem will be later if they do quit because that could drive population down. I'm not really interedted in classic but I hope it thrives so player who enjoy it can have their cake but I was always worried of the amount of player who were campaigning for it that might only needed their "quick fix" and then will leave making the project closed to a ghost town than it should.

No gear? Mage.

---
Why not a lock?
---
How many times a day can I run an instance? Like, if I run Deadmines, can I join another group and run it again the same day? I remember they added the need to reset instances at some point, but don't remember when. 
---
How does that all work in Classic?
---
It's garbage. Non existant specs for pve, hybrids suck for tanking and dps
---
“PvP” in the sense that in world and realm first races you do compete against other players, while if you just raid casually you only compete against the encounters themselves (so purely PvE).
---
That was literally the debate.. You said the playing field will be level in the next content release, implying it wasn't from the start, but it obviously was. "Leveling" has nothing to do with "being level".
---
So im not allowed to have an opinion now?
---
WHY DONT YOU SHUT UP? (Kevin from The Office)
---
How do I go about getting a wand? We're only level 6 atm.
---
Yikes.
---
What spec should I use for leveling a rogue?
---
Everyone is inside SM at those levels that's why.
---
I feel you. Especially not having any good aoe for some of those larger packs.
---
I've been starting out in battle stance, charge, switch to D stance mid charge (it's on a separate global and I have tactical mastery to maintain the rage), demo shout to get initial agro on everything so HoTs dont agro. Then I try and get autos on everything and stagger my revenge procs across the enemies that are taking the most damage to proactively get threat against the dps.
---
That initial threat is really important. Thunder clap is practically useless for threat and I only use it for the debuff if I've got the rage. Much more threat from revenge and sunder. It seems like there's much more micro management, I've never been so focused on auto attacks.
---
Alliance or horde?
---
Debatably. The alliance hunt forsaken because they think they’re scourge, and refuse to be reasoned with.
---
Humans are the U.S of WoW. They’re the worst kind of evil - the ones that honestly think they’re the good guys.
---
At least the forsaken never claim to be righteous or good.
---
I think WoW Classic lives on because it's both a good, and true, mmo. By that I mean, it continues to be popular because at its core, WoW Classic is significantly different from other games. This isn't a FPS or RTS game of yore, reskinned and rereleased to scoop up nostalgia dollars. The appeal of Classic is as strong now as it has ever been. It really is all about community. People find homes in this game and become invested. It meets the desires of so many different kinds of players. Rewards are significant and harder to come by. Hardcore players have an abundance of casual players to show off their hard earned rare mounts and raid gear. Folks who just enjoy making bags for their guildmates feel valued and appreciated. Every rung you climb feels significant. 
---
Will it last forever? No. Will it be dead in a year? Highly unlikely.
---
Frost nova is trainable at level 10? Possibly 8. You absolutely should have it. Arcane explosion can be trained at level 14.
---
Also,are you updating your hotbar when you train new spell ranks? As in, your frostbolt should be like rank 2 or 3 by now, you're not still using rank 1 are you?
---
I agree but that's a wildly unpopular opinion on here. The way it is, the content we are getting is already figured out and will be beaten instantly upon release like MC and Ony.
---
They need to update at some point or it will die.
---
Weapons for feral druids are just stat sticks, DPS doesn't matter.
---
Stat wise 1 STR = 2AP, 1 AGI = 1AP + 0.05% Crit/Dodge  
---
I personally value STR over Agi but while levelling it isn't a huge deal.
---
Do you like BfA or Classic mechanics?
---
What about changing the items to some new AQ Event only items that only drop or can be obtained during the event? This way they can't be stockpiled ahead of time, but doesn't restrict anything else.
---
The most drawn out fight I've had in my life was back during vanilla when I played a Warlock. A higher level Paladin (conned orange) attacked me in STV. The battle continued on for a couple of minutes, with both of our health rising and falling. It seemed I was finally the victor, and then he bubble hearthed.
---
Oh yeah forgot to mention, I am aware frost is the way to go, but I am looking for a list, that will tell me what talent to take at what level
---
It's BiS for me right now.
---
Jesus. Good luck lad.
---
These people have 5+ year gaps. Doesn't matter where you are in the world dude, you are way fucking behind the curve in any field.
---
So other people can’t have fun and competition because it ruins your constricted idea of what is “the spirit of the game”?

That link is fantastic. Thank you.
---
I’ve got one. You have to install an addon to see what spells enemies are casting. Fix that. 
---
You have to install an addon that shows you how much time is left on *your own debuffs*. 
---
You have to install an addon that puts a number on the cooldowns of your abilities.
---
Do we, as a community, agree that the game would be better if there was an interface option to toggle that on?
---
What's an addon that I can use to see target health/mana?
---
I see on Jokerd's stream he has a very clean one and I'm just wondering if anyone knows what it is.
---
This is really neat. Too bad I'm beyond incompetent with Photoshop/gimp.
---
15/21 are full atm
---
Y’all I’m starting to think this is an Australia problem more than it is a Blizzard problem.
---
It is true, the wranglers only drop em, the storm callers dont.
---
This is why it's crucial you pick a class/spec that you personally can "mob grind" with. The class fantasy is nice, but if you hate how fast you go from one mob to the next you'll never make it to L60.
---
I think its one of the newer servers in the US.
---
You can still reset instances yes
---
The 5-6 method players each had their own raid group, you know that right? The event was pretty big, all method players had their own tactic for leveling to 60 and they raced each other, and the idea was that once they got to 60 they would race each other for the boss kills. They just didn't think there was a whole league above them coming from the private server scene.
---
Sorry what? Link naxx logs of locks beating mages consistently with equal gear? And adding sapphiron or gluth is cheating.
---
Ishu Awane questline gives you a very good wand. There are also plenty of drops/crafts and quest rewards that award better wands. Tbh, I'd rather wait then buy it since you'll replace it anyway.
---
Only if WoW had Raytracing
---
Not sure about that, leveling was the higher wall and when phase 2 comes out that will not be a factor, theyll be more prepared sure, but i wouldnt call the race yet.
---
Yeah, facts. But, it’s good to have that to plan as I level.
---
Cringe.

I keybinded them to numpad, it's good
---
yes u are
---
Run the instance, finish it, wait for others to port out, run back and get it.  This is the way of the rogue, no honor among thieves!
---
Right now, taunt seems almost useless to me. It seems like taunt doesn't even make the mob focus on me and when it does the shaman dps immediately takes that aggro back. They're probably all using rockbiter or something.
---
When you're higher level you might also find warlocks randomly casting Detect Invisibility on you.
---
We try to help!
---
Mad cuz bad?
---
No, you are mistaken. Imagine a mage, doing nothing, bored and waiting, see's a message for water or portals or whateverthehell and happily volunteers, whispering the person who needs the supplies. No problem!
---
Imagine a mage doing professions, or running somewhere, or just busy with their OWN game in whatever way and suddenly they get an overly nice message asking for water. You say "No" and they yell at you, curse you out, whatever it is. (And please don't respond with 'but I'd never do that, I'd just look for another Mage!' because I'm talking from experience and a lot of people don't respond in a rational way). So, to avoid all this shit, you comply, even though you don't really want to. 
---
Now, the mage is wasting his own time to go and meet with this person and give them stuff. Exactly what makes you think the mage owes any time to anyone just because they asked? Again, being nice is nice, but when you give people an inch, they take a mile, and I can tell you this is true from about 15 years worth of private servers.
---
You can't unless they've actively enabled PvP. 
---
Also, [this](https://i.imgur.com/TOsbT74.png) doesn't surprise me since your purpose for ganking is ruining someone's day.
---
? L2yesterday
---
good answer. Thanks
---
Depends on how you do it.  In middle of fighting mob and close to death?  Then yes, dick move.
---
Hunter auto shot is so buggy. I hit it once and it only shoots one time. I have to spam it to work consistently. Never happened to me on pserver
---
Was it “SisterFister”?
---
&gt;I only jump people who are more than 5-6 levels below me or if they're currently fighting a mob or in any way I have a huge advantage that will secure my win and demoralize and make the enemy angry.
---
Much better.
---
There's a add-on for it but I cant recall the name
---
&gt;The alliance hunt forsaken because they think they’re scourge, and refuse to be reasoned with.
---
yes, the battle at the wrathgate proved them right; its not debatable that the forsaken are straight up evil
---
The only one complaining here is you
---
Did you just assume OPs toons gender?
---
i thought the dungeons would be the hardest part, but those were a breeze
---
the real challenge was getting the crystal when there's a constant stream of hordes running into the dungeon, always making sure to stop just to kill you
---
Are you on their server? Who honestly cares even if you are. You're not going to get world first anyway as it is. So why do you care so bad if someone else does?
---
Haha, im playing on a laptop mac
---
Tanks are always the last ro join what i've learned, and they're also last to leave the group too for me atleast so far.
---
The Storm Callers DO drop them. I literally just did the quest and most of the bracers i got from callers.
---
hahaha did you just call ganking "sociopathic behavior"? Holy shit that is hilarious. 
---
I also cheese in starcraft 2 sometimes, psychopath status confirmed.
---
My satisfaction comes from killing people like you who take the game so seriously. You can think you're the best player in the game, but that really doesn't matter when i shred you as you're sitting down to drink.
---
Started with like 16 3/4
---
Had to be done.  https://youtu.be/xLJrzfWTu9E
---
Yup it worked!
---
No lol castsequence macros are terrible.
---
Use this
---
/use [nostance:x]stancename;abilityname
---
Where X is 1 for battle, 2 for defensive, 3 for berserker
---
Yes but it is 1.13.2.
---
Yeah that’s fair. So far it seems if i hunters Mark, send the pet to attack, serpent stink, and then arcane shot the owl has aggro before it gets to my dead zone. So it’s been legit so far
---
No changes doesn't mean 1.12, it meant no changes outside of vanilla. Most nochangers wanted progressive patches
---
The warrior has way more opportunity to get 2h weapons than a cloth caster, you mental midget
---
You realize people enjoy competition, the group that first cleared MC got to be the group that first cleared MC, that’s an entirely unique experience. Just because that is different from what you enjoyed, doesn’t mean it’s a ruined classic experience.
---
Chill with people while you're on a flight path or auto walking somewhere. Multi tasking EZ
---
Is this alliance side or horde?
---
I you trying to move while shooting? You have to stop for Auto shot to go off, which is why a swing timer is nice for us.
---
Soft caps are indeed mana pools, for example, or dots that the boss throws which progress and can't be dispelled. Hard caps are simple enrage timers, meaning that the boss will gain absurd stats after a predetermined time and can't be defeated.
---
then im palying the right one but theres no pvp servers available is it because im not level 10 yet or something.
---
Org has 2h - Axe
---
Undercity - Sword
---
Thunderbluff - Mace
---
I'm still waiting for Shadowbane to kill EverQuest.
---
That's sad :( at least in PvP we perform very well as Ret or holy
---
I wish you were tanking my groups.
---
I've only met the super-serious "5 sunders is the only way" type of warriors. The ones that pull with their bow and hide behind walls.
---
So slow.
---
It has interrupt. You can use lvl1 earth shock instead to prevent aggro but most player don’t do this.
---
I suspect classic will survive for a long time.
---
People don't play classic for raiding or dungeon content. That stuff is a side activity. The play it, in a large part, for player generated world content. Players *are* the content. That's what I hear repeatedly is appealing about classic, and it's what is appealing to me.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the recommendations:)
---
Keep it up man good stuff!
---
The only feature I liked with Questie is hover over a mob and seeing that it's the correct quest mobs. Is it possible to disable all other features?
---
How?
---
thats good news. I can bring my laptop with me to work and use mobile to play wow secretly then!
---
That's the only bug I've encountered
---
Oh boy, get ready for the DPS to act like it's BFA, you'll get no threat generated and blamed for not using Thunder clap enough.
---
Good luck!
---
Yeeted the fuck out of there
---
 [Something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTO5vhRFCv0) ?
---
I'm on NA so I guess I can't speak for EU realms.
---
I hear you brother, Just spent 4 gold and 50 silver on lw skill increase although I won't get mats for it in a while. Broke again. -.-
---
Herbalism mats are extremely cheap on my server ATM. Might be wise to pick up mining instead, profit off of sales, and then re-arrange your skills later.  If end game herbs are super expensive, you could relearn it then.
---
Ah that makes sense. Thank u :)
---
Both. The answer is complicated. But the simple answer is both. I don't have a problem about mechanics. The only problem is that i feel like i lose time playing classic if nobody is going to play it in 1 month.
---
It's great, the roleplay I run into is amazing
---
That was pretty much expected and the reason Blizzard didn’t want to put up a ton of servers to handle the load for the first week just to have the population fall off in the first couple of weeks.
---
Yeah and that’s fine, but these people did, they set a goal, and were able to achieve it, not they have a special experience of getting worlds first
---
The rain is one of my favorite things so far. Does it rain in most zones? I think I've only seen it Loch Modan so far. Haven't seen it yet in Elwyn, Redridge, or Westfall (I haven't spent much time in any of those three).
---
Cool thanks brotha
---
You can also not be a dick and let someone who NEEDS an item have first dibs on it.
---
Memory is foggy but during vanilla didn't select top guilds purposely stockpile and unload items to trigger the opening even during off hours - aka - maximize potential for themselves at the expanse of the bigger playerbase?
---
Yeah, that was my point. Sorry if it wasn't clear. Vanilla definitely is a different game than retail (although I haven't actually played retail for quite a while, so I don't know much about the current state)
---
I'm on Whitemane (PvP) I killed a warlock right before I took this screenshot. I still have one of her dots on me.
---
Will you have fun? Then no time lost! Idk why people view wow as a job
---
WC3 undead were the scourge though.
---
I just hit 30, about to start spamming gy.
---
You just need 29+. Healers could be 27 or 28.
---
Library everyone should be at least 30 or 31.
---
Arm, 34-40
---
Cath, 37-42
---
It doesnt take propper gear. APES rolled it in greens, with no consumes. Classes and bosses dont have enough skill requirement for there to be the massive discrepency between good and bad players on a mechanical level like there is in retail. I think its realistic to assume casuals in a level 60 raid, with leveling gear and some BRD/BRS gear, could get Rag kills very, very easily. 
---
Once DMB or Bigwigs clsssic drops, even LFR level players should be able to clear Naxx if they get in discord with a raid lead. We already have weakauras, which is an insanely powerful tool. 
---
The meta for raiding at a non-hardcore level is broken. Classic raids are irelevant when it comes to generating gamer cred. There's no prestige to getting final boss kills.
---
It’s a whole different world in pvp. In pve they are pigeonholed into healing but in pvp they are very good if played correctly. They have a higher skill cap. If you are feral you will use every tool available to you (cat, bear, and humanoid form skills)
---
It happens when I'm focused on a mob and keep sundering it. Somehow, in prot stance, I'm not able to output more threat than the shamans even with taunt.
---
It doesn't help when there are two shamans, and they're each focused on different mobs.
---
What level are you??cos from lvl 40 its easyer to make gold with quests
---
Region side and time gate would stop hardcore guilds. 
---
Change the turn in every day too.
---
Same for me. First time I'm trying to log in since release. My friends queued up just fine a few hours ago and haven't had this problem since they started playing a few days ago.
---
Two sides to this right?  1: They can't open it with out you so why should you share? 2: You wouldn't be there to get it with out them.  IMO just roll for it.  If you want to pull some shenanigans, that's up to you.
---
!RemindMe 2 hours
---
I’ve been talking about this with my friends.  There are plenty of items out there of the same drop rate/tier as the war effort so they could just pick them. It’ll still go faster than before but won’t be done immediately.
---
Honestly this is so simple to fix. Dire Maul = DM 
---
Deadlines is technically called The Deadmines so
---
The Deadmines = TDM... 
---
Idk makes sense to me
---
Do you have a ranged attack or shoot ability to use instead? You can't put the weapon itself on the bar to attack with it. You would do that for on use consumable items.
---
Because mages don't have tanking talents, whereas Paladins, Druids and to a minor extent, Shamans do.
---
I'm not saying they should balance them, but this is factually part of the poor class design of classic WoW. Keeping it poorly balanced *is* authentic.
---
Personally you'll want to level classes up to around level 20 so you get a feel for them as some of them start off "slow". At that point you'll understand the pros/cons of them and their roles.
---
I gib u silver cuz u funny
---
Twitch desktop app has WoW add-ons built in.
---
- Download App
---
- Mods tab (I think that's the name)
---
- Wow add-ons 
---
- Direct it to wow installation folder
---
- Search and install through GUI
---
I should had joined one of those crowded servers. Would get so much more work done during queue 😂
---
Retard confirmed
---
I feel like I’ve seen a LOT of shamans
---
I think both have their pros/cons but since classic is probably in it's prime right now and you won't be able to experience launch week again I'd say classic. 
---
If you aren't feeling it and want to play BFA then can do that, but if you aren't feeling BFA and want to play classic a few months/weeks from now then it's probably going to be a worse experienc.
---
keep em coming
---
 !RemindMe 10 hours
---
So if I play casualy I have no chance to raid in Nax?
---
This is perfect
---
I figured it out for RFC atleast. I know there are some specific mobs in the upcoming dungs that you want prioritize kill or sheep.
---
it has...  
---
Random, Var, ...
---
right click your portrait - ‘reset all instances’
---
Hey!  I always /wave first!
---
Questlogex
---
So you didn’t have a source when you claimed it of your own accord?
---
Warriors and Hunters both much more than others. Thankfully though, there are still not as many "tank" warriors and I get groups easily!
---
Yeah,"going to outlands" is not the problem i think...
---
Thats a Nice loot for my Hunter.
---
Where are you now?? If your in IF i would say go loch mosan first then westfall
---
That’s layering if you are the only one or don’t see many people
---
It's soooooooooooo pathetic to practice and plan an achievement, set up for the moment, and then beat everyone else in the world at this chosen task.
---
I’m actually taking a break because of how much obsessed I am with Classic to the point my health problem is getting worse again. I’m not the one to preach but play in moderation folks!
---
*Illidan has joined the chat*
---
They stopped reporting it when people left in droves during WoD.
---
I was skeptical but started using the twitch app this week. It is very easy and has worked fine for me
---
Check the tweet date man. He said it on 21 August, before classic even released...
---
Yes please, just remove spell batching, its really annoying specially if you are playing a hunter
---
r/gatekeeping and also r/gaynerd
---
I have something that is similar in functionality. That will switch to battle stance, charge, and hamstring.  Have to double press it if charging but not if in combat. I'm sure you can add a mod no mod to it.
---
They haven't been available to the public for a few years now. But in their quarterly calls they still give a general indication. BFA was dropping but they said in their last Quarterly call that subs had increased due to upcoming classic and patch 8.2. 
---
I think the lowest sub count we know specifically was in WoD at 5.5M subs. Though in Legion they announced that they had the most subs since like Cata or Wrath IIRC.
---
Never seen a rogue
---
Fuck the Kobolds and their stupid ears, and FUCK the Moonstalkers and their stupid fangs...
---
If they potentially got a binding drop it could. but for the most part i agree.
---
That’s classic wow for ya. Rng drop
---
How would I find that out? I think this is the same way I used the starting weapon for Tauren hunter but I just have an upgrade now
---
Yet people are still chastising Blizz for them choosing to roll on a separate server from their friends.
---
I’m mainly looking for the ones with the weapon and shield swaps included, not to just change stance, for instance if in defensive stance, and the mob dodges, a macro that would equip 2 hand weapon, switch to battle stance and cast overpower, but would just cast overpower if I’m in battle stance . Also a one button macro to switch back to defensive with 1h and shield. I’ve seen a lot of these macros on lists but I can’t get the ones with the weapon swaps to work.
---
Kinda no where near the point.
---
I'm on bloodsail Buccaneers and I can't go anywhere without several people doing the exact same thing as me
---
For feral dps you will want to be able to equip Maces. BiS slot for dps in a mace dropped in gnomegan if sleeked wrong I apologise. The in use effect is what makes it BiS. You will potentially farm lots of these
---
Blizzard has never banned anyone for using an addon ever.
---
You need to equip it and buy ammo, then your autoattacks from range will be fired from the gun. If you don't have guns trained you can train them at the weaponmaster in TB
---
I stopped playing for the night and it stopped the next day
---
The amount of people coming from retail with minimal classic knowledge telling other people how to play their classes is hilarious
---
So did they ever tell us exactly how it works?
---
oh shit!
---
where's my 7 hour shaman quest, blizzard
---
World first ragnaros was 15 years ago friend. It’s not a real world first race if you can practice it 100 times on a private server before launch.
---
Cus they have a tank tree?
---
I feel sorta bad, I haven't upgraded flameshock at all because I'm trying so save gold. It is super useful when the tank pulls too much and I can pull one thing off him and tank it myself. Or throw down slow totem and have em run.
---
I mean belive me i did all of these raids before the nerfs they were not as easy as the later patches made them.
---
i havnt even mentioned scholomance and stratholm, both of those were nerfed into a joke.
---
and i did not list the huge player buffs like
---
* Mana regeneration is now disrupted when a spell has completed casting rather than at the start of casting. It will resume normally five seconds after the last spell cast. This change increases the total time spent regenerating mana and therefore increases the total contribution from Spirit for mana-based classes.
---
Buy a wand. After a couple frostbolts switch to wanding.
---
Kurinax
---
Thank you for reminding me about that functionality. I need it myself and found this: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auto-track-quests
---
I haven’t tested it, but it seems to be what we need. I hope it somehow removes the limit of only five tracked quests.
---
The stats benefit the caster more. (Agi staff aside.)
---
I almost got one shot by a warrior because of that insane melee reach. There should have been no way he could have hit me but low and behold, I see him swing and take like 65% of my hp.
---
so your saying im in the right server just the wrong realm? there is no option to pvp. just duel... under realm selection there are none that say "pvp" thats all im saying. and am i even playing wow classic? or just regular wow? It says world of warcraft starter edition. to me it looks like it did back in 2004 so is this not it orrr?
---
Dead? No.
---
Even UO and EQ aren't dead.
---
Problem is that even if the design was perfect, which it obviously isn't - there's the problem of content.
---
The content is ancient - and we've all seen it.
---
Maybe if there was fresh and ongoing content to go along with this old-school design approach, we might have something.
---
But there's really nothing to look forward to, that you haven't already seen a hundred times over.
---
In Vanilla WoW days this would be regarded as exploiting a not "working as intended" mechanic and you would get punished, HARD.
---
I think any reasonable person could've deduced that raid XP wasn't working as intended, so the old feigned ignorance shouldn't work.
---
This has done massive amounts of damage to the game already. The entire dungeon ecosystem is broken and the exploits let people corner the market at their inflated level. Add in PvP enabled servers and the implications are even worse.
---
Funny how all these WoW killers adopted a F2P model over time and WoW can still justify costing a monthly subscription and now they're even making bank off of a game from 15 years ago.
---
This looks promising. I’m new to macros, gonna try it out as I just got to lv10 with my warrior 😁
---
If you're taking your sweet time then just go to work and level when you're home.
---
Seagull wants somebody to make a custom overwatch match with all the heroes reset to original overwatch and ana added into the original roster. Would be pretty crazy since the game has changed so much.
---
You can really tell who played pservers. Last night, after 3 horrible WC groups, I had one that was just working so well. About midway through I asked everyone who played private to /cheer and they all had. 
---
I'm very happy people are trying Classic from Retail, but you cannot faceroll these dungeons (specifically leveling dungeons not m+) like you did in Retail. You have to pull methodically, you have to CC, you have to let the tank get the aggro, you have to watch your DPS. It is a much slower pace, but also more fulfilling. 
---
Slow down, pay attention to your surroundings. One extra mob can ruin your day out there.
---
Sometimes i pull on it so hard i rip the skin
---
Who wants to do that grind? No one... you have literally years to play, why rush?
---
You can do what you wanted with a leading space: 
---
  #showtooltip
---
You seem confused.
---
Their version of hardcore and your version are just different.
---
Any thay have auto tracking quests and track more than 5 quests?
---
I named him Kloeingr but it didn't fit. I don't have a new name picked.
---
Ainsley on the road to jerk his next meat, boi.
---
There are add-ons that show health of other mobs
---
Does it work in groups or it has to be raid? I've tried it while in a group and it didn't work.
---
Honestly, the fire totem one is bad enough lol. But the Paladin one takes so long because you have to do DM, SFK and BFD. It isn't even for an ability either lol Just the weapon.
---
‘Rich’ 
---
You’ll be hoarding that for months before you can get value out of it. Or you can use it and be cool!
---
u dont have space
---
They've proved today that it literally doesn't even matter - APES downed Onyxia with 34 people even with half their roster dying before Phase 2 because the mechanics of the fight were scripted differently than on private servers.
---
Dude's level 50, this is pretty far from a guaranteed ding.
---
"Classic race to world first"
---
Never shows anyone who actually produced a world first. 
---
Only shows Method.
---
Thus, the title is referring to those ON stream.
---
One does not title a stream. "World first to beat Super Mario presented by (name)". Then proceeds to not show the person who actually beat it world first. 
---
One can then interpret that that streamer failed miserably at become the world's first to beat Super Mario.
---
No need to move that goalpost. Not what it is about. It's about Method giving the wrong signals and getting backlash for it. Just an observer, not a debater.
---
Alliance side
---
Where did the WoW pop socket come from?
---
Just makes it sadder how hard it was for us back in 2004.
---
Absolutely. Classic WoW is an incredible game solo or with a group. If you do play, at some point somebody will randomly invite you to their guild: join it. It’s a great way to make new friends and have people to help you level up. I could not recommend classic enough
---
Do you have any proof it was not like this in vanilla, but no one noticed?
---
Sounds to me like you should play retail for more end game. All that's left in classic after you get everything is PVP or level alts.
---
You have my intellect buff for standing up for the little guys. A group of probably lvl 40+ alliance dudes were camping Tarren mill last night right as I got to Hillsbrad for the first time. Was exciting at first, until it got annoying just trying to do even one quest.
---
Also, reeling back from having no free will as the rotting scourge back to being sensible and sentient must really have a traumatic effect...
---
I mean, imagine having to accept who you are on top of everything else thinking you're the worst kind of monster there is!
---
That could explain it. I'm only level 31 though I thought I was fairly behind
---
Yeah I mean on specific scenarios sure but what I meant is that in general a random group of mobs you shouldn't tell people what to do you are busy enough as a tank getting aggro with taunt to one mob and getting another mob's aggro with pure dmg, mixing stuns to make time until you get taunt again and so on
---
Each turn in of the Shellfish (5 shellfish) is 55s. Each cage can give 1-2 shellfish, or spawn a Crawler. Within an hour you can have 3-4 stacks of it all, depending on competition, meaning 9G-11G per hour.
---
I haven't had queue problems since like the 3rd day
---
WoW on Linux via Lutris works (better than Windows, higher fps), there's threads around here on reddit that guide you through it all!
---
 **we feeling if you logging in and ....**  wtf what i wrote there xD
---
Not too sure sorry, will need some Alliance players to chime in.
---
I assumed multiple target packs, I do TC targets that are hurting me bad because it slows their attacks
---
Except stringy wolf meat and boar chunks, tons of people don't level cooking early and don't wanna grind shit mobs for low level meat. Lowbies vendor that kind of crap long before thinking about AH. Rogues need cooking 60 to function so they're in demand
---
Player numbers aren't public but no its not in trouble.  Its dropped off significantly since its height, but its still the most played MMO out there.  It still receives huge population boosts at expansion launches too so the interest is clearly still there.  It'll be around for at least another 10 years and probably longer.
---
Welcome!!  This is how I felt when it first came out!  I had only played FPS games and I even made fun of MMOs...then when I played I couldnt stop!  Classic is the shit.
---
Better for sure atleast on Mirage Raceway EU.
---
TeamViewer of RealVNC.
---
Think what Star Wars rogue one was
---
Gotcha, but with the context of the rest of the sentence it's a stretch. I feel you though
---
So what then? Are you saying that apes isn't good because they didn't beat method because method didn't compete?
---
What kind of ass backwards logic is that? Are you really trying to discredit someone's accomplishment because they practiced more?
---
"yeah that person that won the competition trained way too hard for it so it doesn't count." imagine if they applied that same logic to the olympics where people train for their entire lives and then started taking away gold medals because the winners practiced for 15 years.
---
Not my experience at all. On my realm which is a Medium RP realm, every Human zone is crowded as fuck, to the point where there are too few mob spawns to reliably get quests done.
---
If that's your experience, you must have been miraculously put on an empty layer.
---
Got some sauce on that?
---
Wise tip, I’ll make sure I write it down and put the written note next to my bed so that it is the first and last thing I see each day.
---
When does it get better? I’m 24 and if I don’t open with a charge and bloodfury into thunderclap and swap into defensive stance I can’t hold shit. Even then I can’t.
---
My alliance can't so much as sneeze in stonetalon without 30 horde flocking to kill my human.  So I don't think it's a night elf exclusive problem.  Unlike original classic where a wave and moving on was common it seems everyone this go round is more the red it's dead style.  Kinda takes the fun out of the old suspense in vanilla of thinking to yourself "I wonder if that guy is going to be friendly or not" when the answer is always not friendly.  Sadly I was really looking forward to that tense feeling of not knowing and reliving that nostalgia and i haven't felt it once.
---
On any game the difference is going to be massively noticeable as is being in 5k vs 1080p. It all comes down to if having more hertz increases your reaction time and if so does it give you an advantage.
---
That stuff was actually normal afaik... Had it happen to me many times, and I also put people through it myself. I remember several times where we would just hang out or afking etc while waiting for someone eating dinner. Really weird to be looking back at that now!
---
Try CTRL+SHIFT+ESC. Go to WoW Classic and choose “End Task”. This should solve your issue.
---
lol what they streamed the whole thing
---
Thats actually how it came up, someone asked him about classic wow and he mentioned the new overwatch workshop and how he thinks classic overwatch could be recreated.
---
Can confirm, am tauren
---
See lowbie Alliance: "Aw, cute"
---
See same level Alliance: /wave
---
See Alliance attacking another Hordie: "HERE I GO KILLING AGAIN"
---
People tend to end up with people around their own level of attractiveness. Obviously there are outliers, but for the vast majority it's a true statement.
---
It's statistically true that being bald or balding lowers your level of attractiveness by a large amount. This means fewer people view you as attractive. You can obviously still get a girlfriend, but that's not the argument. The pool of women that you could have attracted is much smaller without hair. And the remaining pool that still find you attractive are themselves less attractive than the ones that are no longer in the pool. Whether you accept that or not doesn't matter because it is just a fact.
---
Again, there are obviously exceptions, but this is true for the vast, vast majority.
---
Duskwood can start at 20, but it’s a bit safer to wait for like 22
---
Need that AI buff
---
If blizzard doesn't like the functionality of an addons, they write code to disable it or prevent it from working. Nothing such as what you described would bother them though.
---
Sure, but if I am tanking a mob for more than 10 seconds it will get feared.

I was more referring to WC3 when the night elves started popping orcs for daring to cut down the trees they didn't know were sacred.
---
Every group I've marked in has just ignored them then puked the entire room and refuses to cc. Most people are just playing it exactly like retail then just bitching I cant hold agro lol.
---
What addon makes your quest book look like that?
---
oh right it, thanks. Its even more impressing.
---
When people say meme spec, they almost always mean Ret/Boomkin. However, Ret and Boomkin aren't even close. Arcane Priest is a real meme spec.
---
Or Windows Remote Desktop
---
Cool, glad it went well. It’s usually awful going to STV at 30 so I am glad you avoided that.
---
LEATHER BELT AHHH!!!

Icy veins mage talent specs

Mb got the first try part wrong but I was right in saying they killed it
---
No one knows. We’re not even a week into classic.
---
Any chat us Barrens chat now. Go in to Ateish Elwynn
---
It's hard in the same way taking a road trip from Canada to South America is "hard", except any time you decide you want to push your Pinto over 45 MPH along the way the engine could blow out.
---
I ran BFD with a group and everyone got the Damp note from priestesses within the first 1-2 kills but I didn’t get one even after killing almost 25. Group decided to do the dungeon and I ran it again later after another 15 kills to finally get it to drop. It can be frustrating sometimes but that’s just the game I guess.  Plus it only helps because contrary to retail I’m usually under leveled for the next zone despite doing all the quests and if it weren’t for the grinding quests I’d need to spend more time grinding or doing dungeons just to match the level reqs

Can you do this through iPhone?
---
This question x2
---
Chrome Remote Desktop is what I’ve been using. Works great
---
But people Pug heroic. Which is 30times harder.
---
I got it at 24. I wasnt actually going to do it initially but I was struggling for quests so thought why not. Regretted it at first when I realised I had to get 3 dungeon groups together lol but I couldn't stop once I started. It really did end up being a ton of fun though.
---
 /reload
---
The only time a Shammy should be casting earth shock when not taunting is to interrupt casting.
---
I think there was a blue post about this, but I can't find it. They said that it was actually present in WoW at the time, but was hidden in later builds.
---
is that not correct? tbh i am going off of atlas loot lol. i forgot what blizzard said about it.
---
Was your friend a gnome wedlock and you guys tried to open up on an undead rogue slightly northeast of zoram strand by BFD? if so that was me.
---
I reacted slow but by the time I did I had blown your gnome friend up, and nearly killed you lol
---
Well I'm still sticking with what I said.  It's one of my biggest let downs in classic so far as stupid as it sounds.
---
I fell you. This was what I experienced yesterday. One special hunter (whom actual had named himself "something huntard". His pet was on taunt. Instant attacked everything and complained that I didn't tank it... Same did the warlock with his voildwalker. They seriously either didn't understood the concept of threat and that it is much harder for tanks to generate it on mobs. Special if the mobs don't attack one in the first place, so there aren't any rage to use any abilities. Then also it very often happen that in dungeons with mobs 2-3 level above one, you see a lot of miss/dodge/parry. It is just much harder than in retail, where you basically got permanent aggro but just selecting tank spec.
---
It was just so frustrating. And then the hunter started to random pull more so we wiped... again... yeah.. That was the end of that run for me. Good luck find a new tank idiots.
---
Dude, it’s the first week - most people just wanna focus on levelling. They haven’t even released the honor system. Wait til phase two, things will be *much* different.
---
Lack of a reliable rez can hurt.
---
Only wondering because I have been playing OSRS for a year and loved the new route they took, was hoping blizzard would do the same.
---
Just look at Rs3 playerbase vs osrs playerbase over the years to get an idea of what will happen with wow
---
Just report them.
---
Sure I was, I was hearing how you couldn't do it without fire resist, how it is much harder.  What makes you think the other raid tiers will not be completed within a day or 2 of release?  All I have seen of this "difficulty" is simply just time commitment.  Oddly enough, the most optimal way to play the game is still to avoid the community and do instanced runs with a group. 
---
I am still enjoying it, but as someone who simply likes grinds for the sake of a grind to be able to do hard content later it is a bit disheartening.  I will still play but I will say my hype for BL3 went way up and I will probably play PoE's next league even though I decided I wouldn't so i could focus on classic.
---
Seriously this game is about the journey and the leveling and enjoying the trip.
---
Oof warrior with enchanting? Did you just really feel like being broke as fuck for your entire grind to 60?
---
I’d say they’re starting that high to see if anyone will actually buy (I’m sure there are) but $10 just for one gold is pretty crazy.
---
Guess what my ingame name is  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&lt;APES&gt;… more like &lt;ADDERALL&gt;
---
Please someone tell me there is an addon where I can see my healing done on other people? In real time? With green numbers? Is that a thing?
---
Most "meme specs" bring some form of utility to make up for their lower damage output...
---
Ah yea thanks for the tip! I only play 3 times a week for 1-2 hours so I was hoping with tips I would get the right choice. With all to level 20 would take me so many weeks haha.
---

Warrior &gt; Priest + Mage + Rogue &gt; Shaman &gt; Warlock + Hunter &gt; Druid
---
Quite close mostly in my experience, although I really haven't seen many Druids, Warlocks or Hunters. Warriors are popular, but not that much more than Priest/Mage/Rogue.
---
but not so obvious in SW down the road
---
Yup by itself the Westfall one is better.
---
Found out the power of Demo Shout last night in SFK. Such a great ability.
---
Taurens  😔...  Amiright?!!
---
Only shows 4 or 5 members of Method who actually participated in the celebration of release and a tonne of other players chasing the world first achievement including Kennymarsh and Esfand... they couldn’t just broadcast  everyone’s streams for legal reasons (copyright and such). My original post still stands - Method did not intend on achieving any world firsts. They merely hosted and produced the event.
---
Didn’t play rogue in vanilla, what is needed at cooking 60?
---
wtf im a gold farmer now
---
It was sort of immersion breaking to get the OP version of the icefury wand rather than the original, but no use in crying over spilled milk
---
Ha as an 2h enhancement shaman I just have to look at a mob and I have aggro
---
Was it a tauren by chance?
---
Thank you for the tip! I'm trying shaman now. I'm level 8 and so far I like it. It's like a battle mage!!
---
I think people worry about that group, whining and quitting, before the rest catch up. Which means they quit because they rushed and now there are less people to play and do the content and you end up in trade for hours to not find anyone.
---
Try to form pickup groups in general chat.  Usually people will bite.  
---
There is no need to completely no-life it to 60.
---
wand spec and then go full shadow, you can heal as a spriest until lvl 50
---
No, they’ll do it somewhere between the 4th and 7th
---
Man what a boring post to read.
---
Is this one of those mechanostriders ive heard a lot about

I don’t.

Hence the humor flair.

If you mean a macro.. Always .
---
So glad to hear apes and monkeynews absolutely prove wrong all the anti private server kids talking shit on this subreddit for the past months. pure redemption for private server players. retails kids back in hiding.
---
I was hoping for the same thing, and given how long 1-60 in classic takes, I don't think it'd be unfair at all.
---
Like 6 people from Method are even playing Classic.
---
But whatever narrative helps you feel better about yourself. Retail bad, right?
---
The BGs are subgroups with a particular grudge or objective, they are of the Alliance/Horde but do not represent the Alliance/Horde as a whole.
---
AV for example is a grudge match between Frostwolf Orcs and a Dwarven expedition. The BGs are more akin to local or tribal wars than a war on a global scale between the entirety of the Alliance and Horde, that wasn't until Wrath.
---
How do you know wich player is on a different layer and what do you ask them? I'm sure that now everyone out there knows what layering is
---
I ran tailoring and skinning so I could upgrade my bag size quickly and vendor all the leather, spent the last half of 39 grinding raptors and basalisks in SV because they have high value trash and give you thick and heavy leather
---
A new account costs as much as they're selling 1 gold for, I don't think they care if they get banned.
---
Aughhhhh
---
This post is underrated
---
The only way to get classic players back to retail is to make retail a good game again.
---
I heard it was a sick ostrich
---
That was very cool
---
This misunderstanding that more layers increase overall server cap needs to die. Realm caps are static, although Blizz may choose to increase or decrease the server cap. More or less layers in no way affect overall server population caps
---
If you listen carefully, you can hear the yeet when he back steps
---
The cooldown numbers at the very least are definitely in classic. I use them, and the only addon I have installed is Vendor Price.
---
Just like OS Runescape was forgotten in less than a year? Oh wait it gets 4 times the players that 'retail' Runescape does. I don't think anyone is deluded enough to think that an MMORPG can last forever without the addition of new content, I would guess the majority of the community doesnt want that. 
---
What classic has provided is a revert back to the fundamental mechanics that made the game enjoyable. From here we can build on what we have, explore alternate storylines perhaps like the Emerald Dream.
---
Did I try to? If you're racing to max level that's fine, but know that not everyone sees the game as a race. It's also an RPG, which many people misunderstand nowadays.
---
No, you gota keep that little bugger on a leash or else. Post missing posters around org.
---
Lmao. Yes
---
I dont think I will.
---
Is there some resource that shows server location, demographic, etc?
---
Yet Method are getting all the sponsor money
---
Ladies and gentlemen, the huntard.
---
Just cut it out. I made an observation, like I already told you.
---
They misled a lot of people, whether it was intentional or not. This was clear before it started (see the tweet) and this was still clear during the streams (see chat logs).
---
They weren't transparent about it apart from a few tweets that only a few people saw.
---
No need to argue this, this isn't a debate about who's right or wrong. They objectively gave out the wrong signals.
---
Right over their
---
That... is the worst... I don't even... 
---
WHAT?!?!
---
...
---
Ok. I asked everybody. We had a meeting. We've decided that you're no longer allowed to post your ideas. Ever.
---
It won’t be THAT easy unless you’re part of a good guild. If your guild is shit or you’re pugging it will be pretty fucking challenging. Raid mechanics still kill you in classic
---
I have zero addons and I can see my cooldowns on ticking over my abilities. You don't need an addon to see your cooldowns.
---
Nobody said you shouldn't voice your opinion, literally no one cares. Getting mad/sick to your stomach feeling over a streamer that says he's gonna "report horde for world PvP" that says shit like that all the time jokingly. You just don't see the world around clearly.
---
Us casuals WILL raid, when we get there. We shouldn't base our timelines for the longevity of the game based only on what they expert tryhard guilds are doing.
---
If its on cooldown, just delete it and use the stuck command in the help menu. It'll teleport you to a local graveyard.
---
Watch out man, the little kids with from retail with raging hard-ons for their knight in shining armor are going to come after you! Method could do no wrong! Shame on you!
---
You can communicate with the opposite faction by using "/me" I believe.
---
I did my bad, I always get em mixed up

If only there wasn't a grace period said user could use to log immediately back in making this post useless.

I was never refuting any of that.
---
I think this is a well rounded buy for 600€. AMD apu, perfectly enough for light gaming or older titles, quite light but with full aluminium body. Screen is average at best and I'm not fond of the trackpad but the keyboard is good. It suits my needs. I have an older desktop at home, this will have to suffice for a few months here.
---
My interpretation is that it's a cold war.
---
The two factions as a whole hold an uneasy truce, but are playing footsies under the table. Open war sucks because it devours the world and casualties would skyrocket and economies would go nuts (See: BfA). But they still have their own agendas, represented by subgroups/factions fighting in BGs and in the world.
---
And there are people on each side, such as Thrall, who are working hard for peace but are struggling when those under them want war.
---
I agree they *could* do much to make it better, but think about what you are saying.  WoW retail is them trying to make it better.  That's why it's unpopular here, blizzard *has* done so, and they failed incredibly.
---
Asscandy
---
Tho, those "WoW Killers" were only called that by the people that somehow wanted something different than WoW that was still WoW.
---
I really hated that term. "WoW Killer". It was and still is pure bullshit.
---
Trust me, the guys who are 60 now know what they are getting into. These are private server players who have likely taken part in fresh server starts before.
---
They usually find themselves in a guild or with a small group of like-minded people who also dedicate a lot of time to the game. They won't have trouble finding people to play with.
---
Here comes the outrage culture retail players
---
It really feels good to play for such an old game. I think a lot of it comes down to them using an architecture where the client will start playing the animation etc. immediately when you use a skill and then only later get a response from the server if it actually happened. This can lead to some confusing situations where it looks like you attacked someone but didn't really etc., but it makes the game feel very responsive - it doesn't really feel significantly different from playing a single player game.
---
I tried a lot of the competition that launched after WoW, and so many of them used a system where the attack would only start when the client got the ok from the server. That immediately made those games feel terrible compared to WoW.
---
great idea
---
Can a filthy alliance do this as well? Or is the turn in NPC horde only?
---
Phew, glad you showed up. I was getting worried no one was going find a need to compare this to retail!
---
This isn’t an alternative take. This is exactly what OP described.
---
No but i guess thats because i prefer choice. You said those problems are fixable with addons so why cry to papa blizz and just get the addons? 
---
Or git gud and count your own dots/hots :P
---
The U.S. is the greatest force for good the world has ever seen.
---
RP server?
---
Same level or higher is fair game. You emote (especially /spit) you are getting camped. If its a good fight I usually sap, salute, and leave.
---
Emp was common parlance for those looking to complete BRD
---
I take you have never played an MMO with difficult raids?
---
Mythic raids in retail WoW and Savage/Ultimate raids in FFXIV don't require "a lot of time grinding", and while picking the right classes and specs is a very important factor (more so in WoW than FFXIV) it is far from the only requirement.
---
ive not bought anything im doing the trial version of this game. thats probably whats going on here.
---
Any build works, but your main focus for lvling is rage regeneration. At lvl 20 anger management in the arms tree is a must. It will make your life easier. At lvl 30 sweeping strikes lets you kill 2 mobs at once which just increase your xp gains.
---
Cool. I was heading to Desolace next anyway.
---
I bought a helios predator 300 with a 144hz screen and a 1060ti fro 1.2k USD. I returned it for a acer nitro 5 with a 1050ti and saved 600 bucks and WoW plays no different other then the framerate. Your going to need just a little more power imo to hit 144hz but mx150 would be fine for 100. My nitro 5 has everything on max and hits 100 but I havnt set it higher.
---
Boomkin
---
Well, Runescape IS all but forgotten :)
---
As for Classic, let's see how things are in a few months.
---
That last step sounds like alot of effort, can't the macro say "np"?
---
Every boss has at least 2-3. Magmadar, the king of tank and spank fights, has 4 (fear, melee aoe, random aoe, enrage)
---
In vanilla nobody knew how to play so I believe people were less inclined to engage in combat with the enemy faction. Everyone is a gladiator now. Good luck.
---

Absolutely bank imo. Nobody would even have enough gold now to make it worth it.
---
iam leveling a gnome warrior with duo should i use one hand + shield or two hand axe ?
---
Hah, this is great. They did turn up, they ended up going to Orgrimmar as you didn’t turn up. 
---
May have been a layering issue? I know that previous WPvP raids have been not happened due to layering.
---
For a lot of players, sure.
---
For the rest, it let’s you creatively style your pretty internet princess.  
---
Let’s also be fair that a lot of the classic sets look awful on certain races or in general and personally, if I could be a warrior who could pick from mail or plate (because it’s way different in classic), I’d rock a cowled plate set all the time.
---
Played WoW for years and years, and I remember that Everytime some mmo came out, it was going to take out WoW; obviously never happened. We'd have people in our guild "quit" the game to go play the next, new MMO, and they'd always be back withing a month or so. Funny how that the only thing that can take out WoW, is WoW

You are clearly biased towards Method on just about every point you make.
---
I have played an MMO with difficult raids but thanks for the assumption.
---
What do the Mythic raids require then?
---
 /reload should do it btw
---
The problem is that retail gives you no incentive to play in these zones unless you want to play a single-player game. Retail is very streamlined to late game.
---
what about the other 99% that dont get anything from it?
---
I was so happy it came back. Probably one of my favorite addons.
---
Its in classic its one of the things in their in depth interviews they said isnt changing, just like being able to open all mail or send more than 1 item in the same mail. Just like them going with a 16 debuff limit instead of 8 like it was till like half way through vanilla.
---
Sweet thanks for the two recs. Bet both guys are partying and doing team stuff as opposed to solo leveling, but trying to replicate what they do is probably still a good use of my time
---
Sure, that's why their title is "race to world first", but they're not showing anyone playing but themselves...
---
Suuuuuuuure.
---
Dont they suggest getting blacksmith or engineer as warrior?
---
I cant even login lol
---
That’s what I’ve been doing, taunt the main target to focus on me then spam shouts in between sunder and auto attacks.
---
Firemaw? I recognise that guild
---
I change it a lot but Breaking Benjamin has always been the grinding music for me. Don't know why, must of listened to them a lot when I first played.
---
Back on my original server in classic some zoned were questionable if they would be friendly and others were a guarantee that they would attack. Stv is one example of red it's dead from back in classic for me.
---
The only changes that should be made should be graphical AT BEST and of course they should be entirely optional (You can already have retail water for example)
---
But that's it, if you change anything else it's already not vanilla

I started playing shortly after heavensward released.
---
I just remember enjoying the game exploring and sight seeing and doing side quests/fates/dungeons until I was like level 30.
---
Then I found out I wasn't able to move to any higher zones without doing the MSQ to unlock them so I slogged through that.
---
And then I got to the desert quests where I had to travel back and forth from this port town to this canyon town.
---
Except the only teleport crystal was in the fort between them.
---
So for like 8 hours I was forced to travel one singular road back and forth back and forth back and forth.
---
- Okay got to the port town and talked to the dude and they want me to go to the canyon town and talk to the dude.
---
- Okay got to the canyon town and talked to the dude and they want me to go back to the port town and talk to the dude

The latest Final Fantasy XIV (Shadowbringers) is crazy good. It's probably the best MMO expansion since Wrath of the Lich King and just generally just one of the best Final Fantasy games ever made.

Can see how it's frustrating but honestly didn't mind it personally. Put some music on and grinded out close to an entire level until I got all the horns. It's almost meditative.

I like to give out conjured food and water when I pass by people in the wild. I am only level 16 but when I'm higher level I'm worried my higher rank conjure food and water spells won't be consumable by lower levels.  Is there a list or AddOn somewhere that lets me know the appropriate rank to conjure for a given level range? Or am I overthinking this and any level can consume any rank of conjured food and water?

I'm enjoying reading the actual quest log, but it's frustrating sometimes when I spend time getting there and find out I'm not a high enough level or jump around for 20 minutes looking for a small object.
---
Can say what you want. I know method from way back when blizzard let them have early access to all content so they could get “world first” in everything. They knew they couldn’t this time so they acted like they didn’t want it. Although that didn’t stop them from listing their stream as “world first”
---
And people say we can’t bring meme specs to raids lol
---
What the fuck just happened
---
You are aware that only about 6 of the core team is even playing classic in any sort of semi-serious way. Their event was just a collection of random streamers participating for world first. I highly doubt beyond the first few weeks any core members will continue to play seriously.
---
All the PVP gear will be added in phase 2 with the honor ranking system. Where are you getting phase 6 from? And the reason why the honor system is phase 2 and BGs in phase 3 is because that's (roughly) how it went in original vanilla wow. The honor system was out for a few months before the introduction of WSG and AV.

Also level 14. I get the feeling I'm drifting behind by about a level or so per day compared to the "average." I think most of the players between "new and casual" and "hardcore" are in the late teens through mid 20s

I’d imagine that’s the level for thistle tea if it’s “needed to function”

You'd need an API call to parse chat to watch for a "Thanks" or similar text. The code wouldn't be too bad but would probably take more than the remaining availaable characters - not to mention the potential awkwardness of a false positive in the event your target wasn't actually grateful. Better just to leave this to the operator.

would upvote this a thousand times if possible!
---
I mean this is an RPG, you could say the same about nearly everything. Having better gear doesn't make the fight harder either.
---
It's just a gatekeeper, something to work towards just like the onyxia cloak. Onyxia wouldn't be the same as well if you didn't require that cloak IMO.
---
no luck, just trying to bring up the menu for it
---
No? WC3 has both the Forsaken and Scourge.

Threat Plates is amazing (mostly used by tanks, but is incredibly versatile for customizing the look of enemy and friendly nameplates including showing spell casting.

Challenge a Priest to a duel and ask him to Fear you.

I wish I had stuck with Enhancement shaman like I originally wanted to. Don’t want to start over now though

There's a game that can help with that.

LOL @ retailers bitching about everything not being a cake walk.  Welcome to Classic.  You've gotta put some effort into it.
---
Man I feel for you. I got 7 in 7 birds on that one, the hooves however...
---
I'm off the hype train, the game got considerably better around wotlk. I leveled four characters to 60 in vanilla I have no interest in slogging through it again.
---
in the realm list there is no pvp selection. I have the option to toggle it in game.. but thats it. so your saying if i can toggle it on or off in game THATS IT? because I can do that in my realm. but i thought pvp worlds were worlds that you could log in and fight anyone.
---
getting what people are the best of is a key factor in all of this. method are the best on the fly adaptive raiders APES are the best classic raiders. diffrent skillsets diffrent means of training.
---
Level 22 is ideal, you want to get those 3 points into improved blizzard.
---
Typical route for horde is: Hillsbrad lvl22ish mobs until 24, then the more southern one that is like lvl 24, but get the lower ones too. At 28 you can enter the mine down south and stay there until 30. At 30 you get new rank of blizzard. Then you can go arathi and farm the mobs there until 34, then dushwallow marsh at the tower just south of the base. At 36 you can go over to the murlocs by the coast but it's very contested. At 38 you get new blizzard rank. At 40 you can start doing the raptors further south of the tower, when you get mount you can do both tower and raptors. At 42ish you can do Tanaris wastewanders instead, at 44 you can do pirates in tanaris. At 50 you can do WPL just east of the alliance camp. Then move north to the 2nd of those cauldron quest fields. And finally at 56 you can do healthglen.
---
However I very much recommend aoe farming dungeons instead with a group. 24 you can start RFK, 30 you start SM GY , 33 SM alib, 36-37ish SM arms, 38-40 SM cath, 44 ZF, 52 BRD, 58 LBRS. Doing the later dungeons like SM cath and up as a 7 man or something like that is actually ideal.
---
Lemme know if you need more help.

I was in STV waiting and no callout or quest turn in. Couldn't find an answer online, I assume they will wait a week or a few to add it. Was really hoping for that pole

The tier gear shows who is stacked and who isnt. Its a status symbol. Transmog destroys that. Im not #nochanges by any means, but i dont want that at all.
---
&gt; I think they recently said they were going to fix it, but from their wording it sounded like they're like a year off from that.
---
Funny. That's what I was told 3 years ago...
---
It's a pointless change because anyone lfg'ing for Dire Maul typically specifies what wing. DM N, E or W. Rarely does a single party clear the entirety of "D(ire) M(aul)"
---
For someone who has never played before, they might appear the same at first, but classic and retail WoW are totally different experiences
---
Isn’t it not coming out for ages? I thought this was the case but I could be totally wrong.
---
Not worth it.
---
Fuck no. I always hated this aspect. Just give me sweet BAM!s
---
I’m in love 😍
---
So they could trash it? This sub loves shitting on retail.
---
The ego of everybody for being “good” classic players is so cringe to me. The game isn’t difficult at all .  It’s so weird and toxic .
---
Just Google it
---
All the other talent being somewhat shit would have tho.
---
Remember the last war prot talent at the time ? Something like Allow 5% of your regeneration from spirit in combat. (Which might have also lead to player believe that tank must stack spirit at the time) Now imagine all the other talent tree.

Had a similar experience yesterday in stonetalon mountains, walked up to a alliance looking enemy only to notice it's a ?? Level elite boss. You can bet I noped on out of there
---
It's been 2 hours and I'm still grinding this :(
---
When you think about it, the queue system just  sounds like it was just preparation for how much waiting and patience would be needed once you finally managed to log in.

Andddddd using a mace
---
Ganking is sociopathic? Lmao just reroll PvE now before you get too invested on a PvP server man.
---
I do the same thing camping horde players at the nesingwary camp in STV, killed the same guy probably 5+ times over the course of an hour yesterday. Felt good, will definitely do again today
---
Well, millions of witnesses that did play in vanilla (including myself). Some proofs:
---
There existed a constant *COMBATLOG\_XPGAIN\_FIRSTPERSON\_RAID*, that had a message of 
---
&gt;  %s dies, you gain %d experience. (-%d raid penalty)  
---
^((Sources:) [^(https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/WoW\_constants)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/WoW_constants) ^(,) [^(https://wowace.gamepedia.com/ParserLib/Message\_Types)](https://wowace.gamepedia.com/ParserLib/Message_Types) ^(. The amount was a variable called amountRaidPenalty, and addons had an interface to access it.))
---
Secondly, patch 0.1 has the following patch note:
---
&gt;Raid groups of six players or more will not receive a group experience bonus.
---
^((Source:) [^(https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_0.10)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_0.10) ^())
---
etc.
---
His reminds me that horde are people too.
---
Is it really vanilla wow when it's 3 years after launch?
---
Sent all my boe gear to my ench friend. Good for him but maybe not so great for me 🤣
---
Where the fuck did he say the classic sub did it? Its the wow community at large.
---
Sure. Of course they will. But not by 99.9% of the player base. The hardcore streamer crowd don't matter. Not at all. The game isn't made for them.
---
Nice find! That must have felt sweet getting extra damage this way.
---
AH DUDE
---
I'm a newcomer to WOW and I would love to be able to try the game before paying for it to see if I enjoy it.

So to do it you just join party with someone ? Or its an addon ?
---
Ask yourself what are you enjoying more. Doing dungeon or quests? Maybe both? What I do is I log in and ask myself what I feel like doing. Maybe dungeon. So I do dungeon and then I ask myself again what to do. If you want best exp per hour I would guess dungeons are better now.

What addon are you using for questlog?

Why couldn't their be new content? Why does it have to be BC?
---
Whenever I hit the r button it automatically goes to reply to the last person. Is there a way to make it so you have to type /r? I couldn’t figure it out and it will be nice to have that key in my rotation.
---
Honestly, all of those options seem to fit your criteria. The best class of the three for solo leveling would definitely be the Warlock, but some may argue that the Shaman and Priest are usually more sought after in endgame (though you would be expected to heal). 
---
So if you want to focus more on utilizing your limited time in the open world through questing, go Warlock. If your focus is more towards utility in endgame, go Priest or Shaman. If I had to pick between those two, I'd personally go Shaman. I think their leveling and pvp potential are more interesting.

---
Server? But your answer is mail it to a bank and forget you have it for a while
---
It has been moved over to Twitch now
---
You can also get them on twitch
---
Blizzard just wanted to give people something they were asking for and geetting money out of it instead of letting other just make illegal servers
---
That said, it's not impossible for Blizzard to implement changes to retail based on the sucess of classic, like for example removing Dungeon Finder (While still keeping the LFG system we already use for M+ anyway) and also, removing LFR cuz there's like literally no point in it's existence anyway since if you wanna raid you can just join a group with LFG and the gear you need you are gonna get it from WQ anyway
---
It’s half people memeing and half people who struggle with other people having had a different experience than them. 
---
So it’s basically WoW politics.
---
Theres a lever inside archmage arugals room.  What the heck does it do?

Pallies may only eat one after fully encasing themselves in a bubble environment.

You should keep that, for frostbolt kiting :)

No, trust me on this. He will go from excited for more cookies, to hatred, to just giving up and eating them because he loves you, the 5 stages of grief will display on his face all at once. 🤣
---
Nope. The only source I have is the other 14 posts where people said no tho. So dont quote me.
---
Used to play XIV up to Stormblood. I always kind of felt like the same complaints WoW retail gets where there’s no real socialization, everything is matchmade, you just login and do your roulettes. 
---
I’ve definitely heard Shadowbringers get praised for its story, but is it doing other things to improve the genre? I am curious to try out Shadowbringers eventually but I’m very content with the experience I’m getting from Classic for now.

If you don’t think esfand is the most skilled paladin in the game then I dunno wagwan

I literally just made a meme dude calm your tits
---
the survival spec does look like its focussed on meele, but sadley as the name says, its unfortuantly more for surviving meele engagements against classes like rogues/warriors until you can get more range on them. meele as a hunter is hilariously fun dont get me wrong, but auto attacking with a ranged weapon will always out damage your meele attacks. retail wow however has meele hunters i think, but classic wow doesnt really have a meele spec. it would be similar dps as a mage using a wand instead of spells
---
Agreed. I think it would have been more interesting to see a difficult race to world 1st rag, completing AQ war effort etc.
---
You never know when there are ghosts around.  Buff detect invisibility and just wait in the seal of Lorderan for some spookiness.
---
Taunt doesn't generate threat, it puts you at the top of the threat meter, and DPS think they're safe to continue doing too much threat once you taunt enemies...
---
Imagine being low enough to post on Reddit to stick up for a rat faced streamer missing teeth.
---
My friend and I have been championing “Pirate Ship” or PS for short on Herod. We’ve gotten some positive reactions.
---
Does your server not have an auction house?
---
Correct. And there are no bosses or mobs with + holy resist besides the base resistance for being above player level that you just mentioned.
---
What phase battlegrounds btw?
---
Yea you did not look very hard if you looked everywhere lol
---
ARR didn't come out until three years after Cata and one year after MOP.

No. Tiger's Fury is more like a "I fought one mob, there's another one and I'll cap on energy before reaching them" kind of thing.

I'd recommend checking out some old school WoW videos, such as:
---
* The [How to Paladin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNXAG2sHxpY&amp;list=PLF1237F4503EF5653&amp;index=2) series, which has become more of a meme for the negative reviews it got on WarcraftMovies at this point. This one spans nearly 40 episodes and goes from the Burning Crusade era all the way to WoD.
---
* [Incredible Warrior Tricks 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNgGCGl0_S0) is one of Swifty's best Warrior PvP videos. Swifty used to be a great content producer, until he started selling out to sponsors during Wrath. Since then his channel's content took a huge hit, being largely consumed by like &amp; subscribe giveaways and lazy regurgitated Twitch stream clips.
---
* [Brang 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umetTVtTb2A) is a video that got me into PvPing on my Hunter. This is Wrath of the Lich King era, where things were pretty damn different from Classic.
---
* [Serenity Now Funeral Crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ). This is an infamous Vanilla video where a guild raided an in-game funeral held in Winterspring and slaughtered all the attendees. The funeral was being held in remembrance of a player that died IRL.
---
* [The Internet Is For Porn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRgNOyCnbqg).
---
* Paladins Can DPS [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXNWvytYbyo), [II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEs9coe5XRg) and [III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK6urhdGCMo). These 3 videos are significant because until late Vanilla, it was believed that Retribution Paladins were complete trash and incapable of DPS. The truth is, yes they can DPS, but they are **VERY** gear dependent and generally deal better with Undead mobs.
---
Ok thanks! I'm on Stonespire EU
---
There is a big. Where it shows total people and  not your place in line. But I'd you stay in queue, you should get in just the same. Its only a visual bug.
---
you just get invited to a group by someone from a different layer
---
Or make it say np every time so you can be passive aggressive to ungrateful people
---
ESO is a fun game. It's no classic, but still solid
---
19/20, you are missing one quest OP!

---
I remember it being in the low low hundreds but its been years and it depends on the age of the server anyway.
---
This picture is sad &amp; funny at the same time
---
Plenty of quests are annoying. I spent 2 hours on 1 quest cause of horde. Still going through.  It's part of it and my fault for starting in night elf area
---
Depends what you mean by less likely. Any buffs to an encounter technically lowers the likelyhood of killing the boss, so yes. Is it a significant difference?  No idea, probably not. I am 100% confident that apes would have killed it just fine without. They had no struggle at all. 
---
Though I'm curious about these changes. I have yet to kill onyxia and didn't watch the vod yet, but on pservers onyxias fireballs do have the confuse effect.
---
I don't really understand why so many people prefer PvP servers when it's all about ganking and zerging. And then complain about it like they were expecting they would get an invite or something.
---
So I’m alliance and last night in loch Medan I decided I’d run through Badlands to get that flight path before bed. I got all the way to Kargath and ran straight into two level 40+ horde (I’m 19) before realizing Alliance doesn’t have a hub/ FP there:
---
I deserved those deaths
---
I recently switched over to Benediction. It's been awesome. The pop gets to "high" at peak hours but never a que. It's an EST timezone PVP realm
---
It blows my mind that people actually say Classic raiding is harder, don’t get me wrong I’m loving classic but a Boss with 2 tactics is the hardest it’s gonna get in classic
---
Most of the people I play with are more than cool to stick around until everyone's finished(me included), so thankfully I haven't had any hard feelings there, sorry friend. :(
---
How do I figure what?

Good for you buddy. I'll keep using my questing out on without affecting you at all. Guess I suck 🤗

---
Your words, not mine
---
wait this meme doesn't work. where's all the gnomes?
---
I've thought about this but honestly I'm not sure how they would even go about doing that. There's so many systems that are all interconnected that make WoW Classic and the experience what it is, like for example just bringing spell ranks back doesn't add anything if the rotation-based gameplay with pretty much no resource management stays the same.
---
The world and the long travel times will only be annoying if there are not these small little things to do and see, and if quests only take 2 min like they do on live, fuck running around for 15 minutes.
---
In classic I don't mind the downtime, because everything is slow anyway and I love being immersed in the world. Its just such a different game. What I enjoy most is the community, but how would you even go about reimplementing systems that encourage that in retail? You'd have to fundamentally change the game I think. I think it's a hard problem to solve.
---
Just an anecdote that I found interesting while I was playing in Classic: I'm an undead and around level 15 or so I went to Org and Crossroads. After a while I had to go to a major city to level my profession, and I thought "well I could go to Org and ask a guard where to find this trainer, or I can go to UC via Zepp and train it there, where in familiar in the city and I can head to Sepulcher as well to finish up this one quest that I still had in my backlog".
---
That whole sequence of thoughts is what I like about Classic. The fact that I can even remember the names of the town's I've been to, and also that my character as an Undead actually felt more home in UC because I had spent time there leveling from 1-15, idk man. Its the whole experience that's difficult to go back to.
---
?????????????????????
---
I personally like dwarves better for warrior, they just look too good in heavy armor not to
---
I leveled a Druid to 13, made a Warrior got to 24, now I’m back on the Druid lol...
---
ive been using it, i can't compare it to AAP or guidelime as i haven't used them but it works well
---
My original main was a druid. They THRIVE in the open world, through questing and World PVP. You have a ton of mobility, survivability, and utility. If you're not going to do PvE, then you won't be expected to heal in almost any scenario. 
---
Seriously, go druid. I'd argue that they are the only class that truly have an answer for any situation. You have ranged dps, melee dps, tanking, healing, CC, mobility, buffs, and post 40 you only have to compete with rogues for gear. I spent 10 years with my main as a druid and loved every second of it.
---
Be warned though, your playstyle doesn't really open up until you hit 20 and get cat form. Stick it out until then. Hope this helps. Feel free to DM me with any questions.
---
no they didn't, they steamed only rag because they said the rest was boring
---
In addition to the other reply, don't discount fishing as a gold making profession, especially once we get a more sizable level 60 population. There's a bunch of decently valuable fish, some of them even catchable from a pretty low level of fishing, like Oily Blackmouth for a start.
---
21 with something like 1.5 days /played and some change. I could've definitely been higher by now, but I'm taking my time. I don't see the need or joy in farming dungeons or the same group of mobs over and over again. I'm just doing quests, mining, all that stuff... Plenty of time to catch up later on. I'd like to hit 40 sometime in the next 2 weeks, which should be doable.
---
MC is way easier than raid finder stuff, tho.
---
Yep. Mage, priest, rogue on one server and paladin on another. Considering starting a hunter or warlock…
---
You are right with the levels. It works same as with vendor food (I am 95% sure). You should have lower levels of the skill in your skill book. Not sure about addon. When you are leveling you usually find about same level people in your leveling zones so it shouldnt be an issue. So for example if you are level 30 - you should be in zone that is for levels 25-35 for example. Then your level 2 Conjure food should also work for this level range. If you plan on running in lower level zones to Conjure food i would just take out lower level skill from skill book :)
---
What addon can I install to show me how much something will vendor for? Also how do you do addons now? Havent played since that all changed
---
You can already use /r followed by a space then it will fill the name you’re replying to.
---
Honestly didn’t know all these years that R was the default because I always used /r so TIL I guess.
---
Yep. Tact Mastery -&gt; Anger Management greatly changed the game for me. Rage is much less of an issue now after respeccing. Also, actually reading the tooltips for abilities... I didn't realize that Taunt did nothing if the mob was already on you.
---
Yeah this is my dream for classic as well. We know the shit hybrid specs don't work in classic, but are in a much better place in TBC. We know that a lot of the remakes for these hybrids was actually done by 1.9, but it was withheld until TBC because too much of the team was busy with developing TBC to implement and balance the remade meme specs, and it would be easier to do it all at the same time when TBC was released. It boggles my minds that #nochangers can be so opposed to fixing the terrible specs.
---
40k only though? That's honestly not much considering the other dungeon abuse spots.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong i don't really like layering but the game is too big for no layers.. what do you want 1000 servers that will be dead in a few months?
---
I would rather have them merge dying servers over layering tbh.
---
Layering made the gameplay playable in the starting zones, but it will fuck the economy real hard for everyday its left online
---
I’m a level 20 shaman and this is exactly what I do. I use flame shock and sometimes put down a stone skin totem if fighting hard hitting mobs

You can do that with this:

    /target [@mouseover,nodead,harm]

Add that as a new line under the showtooltip line.

You will want to remove the target enemy line.
---
MC isn't the name of a mob, it's a raid. Can't really down a raid.
---
Back then, yes. But I'm very skeptical it's still the case. I think that the majority of the raiding community will still be more drawn to retail, because in a large part that's what retail is about - dungeons and raids. Classic's strongest selling point is the world and community.
---
Looks like a minion
---
Those are hearthstones right?  Their use is the teleport the player back to the inn or tavern.
---
Made me laugh out loud
---
I am level 35 and have run every dungeon at least once so far. I have yet to see a rogue kick a single ability. As the healer I am constantly sending out Rank 1 Earth Shocks.

amazing
---
Slow as hell scanning for me too.
---
No way he's the sadder one. He was at least he's leveling up fishing and getting fish. The briefer is getting nothing out of the grief.
---
Paladin, Druid, and Shaman come to mind. 
---
Paladins and Druids can both Tank, DPS, and Heal. 
---
Paladins Blessings are crazy good. 
---
Druid mark + thorns is pretty solid. 
---
Melee groups will go wild over Windfury Totem once you get it on a Shaman. Windfury totem is also a blessing and a curse as the RNG can either give your tank an opportunity to generate more aggro, or for your DPS to do so. 
---
All 3 can rez, but Druids have a long cooldown on their rez as its a battle rez.
---
Warriors have ranged weapons though they pull with those
---
They don't have a taunt which is rough
---
Looks like about half a level's worth of xp XD
---
right? why does it matter. +12 spirit isnt that much mp/5 and hp regen from spirit is actually pretty strong for warrior down time being shorter. casters rely more on base damage from spells since int doesn't give spell damage. int only lets them cast longer. and they have wands for down time anyway.

&gt;I don't think they covered other guilds or streams that didn't give them permission to host their PoV.
---
Coverage can be done in many different ways. Hosting PoV's isn't the only one.
---
&gt;As for the title...definitely confusing to name their event itself as "race to world first," but I think that was intentional just to get more views
---
And this is what a lot of people are assuming, which clearly indicates that they gave out the wrong signals.
---
how do I get those symbols by my name?
---
My friend is wanting me to play with him. We will be fairly casual/ taking it slow  due to time constraints. 
---
I was looking for a class to play, I looked into warlock but the soul shard thing looks like a bit of a chore. Which class would you recommend based on the criteria of having minimal ‘chores’ ? 
---
Side note I’m not interested in healing but otherwise I’m not fussed. 
---
Thanks in advance
---
Fuuuuu uuuuuuuuuu uuuuuuck Transmog.  Want a gears look, put it on, stats and all.
---
Lucky. I still can't make my mind up if I wanna stick with my current lvl 14 mage, or go Priest, Hunter, or Rogue.
---
Sounds you took it personally my first post specifically says my server.
---
and then have the healer auto attack the entire fight because you are kept alive by a single heal between pulls.
---
To be honest, it doesn't have to be BC, but BC without flying and arenas sounds perfectly good to me. Especially if it's without a level cap increase as well and the new stuff just gets worked into a level 60  base somehow.
---
You don't really need either, those are generally both just for human readability
---
Classic isn't killing anything😂😂. It's a fad.
---
But in the next expansion you can get killed by a seagull
---
Off color conversation in the Barrens! Say it isn't so!
---
While i'm not personally an advocate for any changes to Classic atm, this is a poor argument imo.
---
Paladins and Druids in particular were clearly designed with the ability to tank in mind, but have a hybrid tax. The idea of a hybrid tax is fine imo but they went a little overboard when it comes to raiding. It's fine for Warriors to be the best tanks but the other tanking classes should at least be viable.
---
I'm pretty sure no one is advocating for Warlocks/Hunter pets to be capable of main tanking in a Raid, nevermind Mages.
---
Take a look at runescape
---
I think they're trying to say that without treadmill progression, the game is nothing.
---
Oh yea, that was the most painful experience from the first rate. The droprate was absolutely brutal.
---
S*it meme
---
You can, but fury is specifically bad after cruelty but before flurry. The early talents are a lot of the weakness of fury tree. Fury is also worse for dungeons, as you just have less rage to spam sunders, you have less mitigation due to not having deflection, and you obviously cannot use either of your level 30 talents while tanking anyways.
---
The beauty of early arms is that you can really take anything, as long as you skip impale and improved heroic strike, which really are terrible at low levels.  
---
If you really want to focus on tanking, I might do [this.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVGxdh0o). skip the third point in deep wounds until you get both anger management and sweeping strikes. 
---
You are giving up 5% damage from 2h weapon spec, but that's a talent with absolutely zero utility for dungeons. It's a good but not amazing talent, so you CAN skip it if you choose to do so. you hit all the greatest hits in rage generation and stance swapping, and still have the core combination for open world play (sweeping strikes and improved charge, so that you have the rage to sweeping strikes and then cleave twice constantly). 
---
In terms of what you can skip.... not a lot, really. I skip shield block, dual wield, slam, and rend after level 31 (you take level 30, but you don't take the later ones). Shield block is useful for dungeons, you you may want that but I am too cheap. you ally can skip dual wield and slam safely, unless you spec improved slam fury, which I don't do (and which is absolutely not a tanking spec, at all).
---
I can't stand how retail turned dungeons into speedruns.
---
Now i'm not saying dungeons should be insanely slow, but racing against the clock and skipping as much as possible or chain pulling the entire instance just isn't my idea of fun. Everything just feels too rushed, like people can't even take 5 seconds to breathe.
---
I kinda of just hate time limits in general in games. It promotes a sense of urgency where in many cases its completely unecessary. It also often promotes a very toxic environment where every single tiny mistake is taking away precious time.
---
When it comes to marking targets in dungeons and raids, do any of the target markers have a specific “accepted” meaning?  Skull is pretty intuitively used to mark a target to kill, but which, for example, might be used to mark a target for polymorph, sap, or fear?
---
!Remind me 2 hours
---
I think I got someone banned for that once.
---
Who said this? No one on private servers say this? 
---
Sure it was hard in 2004 but there's 1 hour naxx clears on private servers, no one is under the illusion it's mechanically difficult.
---
I think that's what people are using it for NOW. I've played WoW since 2007 and consistently everyone believed that Classic Raids specifically were so much harder than modern raids. In BC and Wotlk I believed it. Then I started to notice people saying the same things about Wotlk raids being SOOOO much harder than Heroic Cata raids....which wasn't really true at all. 
---
Specifically regarding classic, the community here was under the strict consensus that MC was going to be much harder than retail until about 24 hours ago.
---
Just use the anti-stuck command?
---
Oh don't mind if I do
---
Out of curiosity what is your total team comp? 1 lock, 1 priest, rest mages? 
---
I play a warrior and I would *obviously* love to benefit from relaxing levelling like this but i fear i wont have a use and wont get picked up if Im simply dead weight
---
Streamers influence the behavior of tons of other people and it has huge ramifications across the game
---
This is what makes it stand out from modern MMOs to me.
---
Modern MMOs are only enjoyable if you're either:
---
- Strictly a "socializer" on [bartle's taxonomy](https://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm) with very few aspects of a killer, achiever, or explorer.
---
- In a tight-knit, highly organized raiding guild.
---
If you're not in one of those two groups, there's really nothing for you in games like Retail-WoW, GW2, FFXIV, etc
---
If you're a killer you're explicitly and openly shunned as "toxic", if you're an explorer then everything is already revealed by the devs.
---
So for me where I'm predominantly a solo player, predominantly an achiever with a lot of explorer and a fair amount of killer, no game really has anything for me.
---
In Classic WoW though, the entire game takes effort and consideration so there's still effort to me.
---
It doesn't result in me feeling like I'm being squeezed into the role of either an ultra-casual who's content to simply patter in the garden or an ultra-hardcore who won't stop until they've squeezed every last errant .0001% DPS increase out of their character.
---
Leveling, professions, reputations, 5 man dungeons, all take a lot more effort and are a lot more free-form
---
Even if I never step foot in MC, there's still a lot for me to personally work toward at my own pace, at my own leisure, as I wish.
---
haha yeah its a shame cos the game had:
---
- GORGEOUS environments/zones
---
- really nice music
---
- very interesting (if flawed) talent trees, that had more detail than WoW's
---
- some very cool gear
---
- amazing class design
---
- awesome dungeons
---
but there were a few things tht fucked it up :(
---
And I clearly said: "I'm probably wrong on that last part."
---
Jet fuels did nothing wrong and bush can melt steel beams. Or something
---
Shame that you don’t have any bag space for it. Hope next one will drop when you’ll be able to pick it up LUL
---
the game is about more than raiding. I never raided until Wotlk
---
What's wrong with rockbiter? I've never played Shaman before.
---
"Deadmines" is one word, where "Dire Maul" is two. DM makes more sense for Dire Maul because of this, meaning Deadmines would be represented solely by the letter D. In addition, Deadmines is technically "The Deadmines". So if you want to be correct, hit up the Westfall channel saying you are "looking for The D".
---
Complete a shitload of quests, ding 14, turn them all in
---
Destiny uses that same principle. You control your character and the world catches up. You hardly notice lag in PvE.
---
Skull is usually first, then X.
---
Star and diamond are usually CC
---
Monotone
---
Imagine all the people
---
Can confirm.  I'm only level 11, but was tanking RFC about half an hour ago with a Shaman.  In the end, I didn't even bother starting my rotation until the mobs had already run over to the Shaman, where I taunted them off.
---
I've already discovered that an important part of avoiding stress as a tank, is not to demand that conditions are ideal, but to adapt to situations which are not.
---
Considering how many threads there are here about it I'd say a lot of people cared.
---
Psycho mantis?!
---
I’m 32 and my dad and I played wow for years together.
---
We are loving playing classic together over discord because I live 80 miles away.
---
But every Sunday I drive to my parents house for our weekly D&amp;D group, and this week I brought my laptop to play a few hours in the office with him. Feelsgoodman
---
Your boys will love getting to share gaming with you, for a long time it was the way my dad and I bonded.
---
Lots of people did, but it was only a portion of the playerbase and it was more of a thing on some servers than others.
---
I think the best argument is that calling it VC is just.. odd, and will confuse the hell out of new players to Classic (of which there are a good number) so why not just use the logical abbreviation of DM. Regardless of if it was used in original vanilla or not.
---
Servers are currently layered to the death because of high demand. Blizz said they will get rid of layering before Phase 2 and as demand lowers. I would expect after layering is gone you will see more players in the world. Also most people are still levels 1-30. So If you are 50 I can see you dont see much players around :D
---
Did you just insult my short legged pink pigtail character?
---
shoot 25 dps id expect it to go to 40+
---
If you have a chat open, you can shift click any item to link it in chat! You can also shift click the linked items from someone else’s messages to link them in your own. To link items that you don’t have access to shift click, there are add-ons as well as classic wowhead, which has a “Links” button at the top of the page with something to copy/paste into in-game chat to link it!
---
Hah I wish
---
do you work for the daily mail
---
Yup. I'm not sure what level are you, as I'm 33, but mobs don't die in under 12 seconds for me, especially if it's mobs my level or higher.  
---
Example being Flame Shock for me is 160 Mana, but deals 189 Damage minimal (as the initial can crit), where as Earth Shock is 145 Mana and deals 126-134 minimal.
---
Yeah dynamic respawns is kinda ruining the game for me. A huge part of the fun derived from grinding in vanilla was being able to do skilled pulls in order to clear tough density packed areas. A large number of areas are completely off limits if you are trying to solo because mobs will respawn on top of you while you are in combat constantly.
---
I get what you're saying, but honestly, all of this is concentrated on a single server, so none of it affects the playerbase that isn't on Faerlina. I get that you're disappointed in Asmongold, but nothing he does matters in the face of Classic WoW. Classic is much bigger than him, the only thing he's ruining is his own experience. He'll be back to retail in a few months and Classic WoW will not have changed one bit because of him playing it.
---
Are people still shitting on Blizzard? They delivered us exactly what we wanted and people still can't let go.
---
He can't hear you over all the money he made!
---
With how long vanilla private servers have existed that's pretty long for a fad...

Happened to me twice today already. RIP

Damn nice job! Gonna customize one later for my guild thank you very much! Font folder seems empty, could u tell us where we can get em?

Hey again!

I've polished the tools a bit now so they are at least somewhat usable. It's not pretty and it's very inefficient but it works at least. I made a demo map as well of me leveling in Mulgore.

Half the people we recruited before Classic launch have already quit. I wouldn’t say Classic is a WoW killer at all.

This guide has helped me alot, tells you where the trainers are for expert lvl

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview

Sadly not so far. I would love to see something too.
---
What? the Forsaken allied with the Humans then back-stabbed and murdered them as soon as they ceased to be useful and all those poor souls the alliance is "monstrously" hunting down gleefully went along with it. 
---
How anyone could see the forsaken as anything other than a slightly less terrible undead scourge is beyond me.
---
Don’t forget he makes well over $100k a month.
---
We are playing together with my friend. Is there a big difference when it comes to drop rates and stuff between Group and Free for all loot systems? Which one should we use?
---
Like is there any possible benefit to free for all loot? I have a feeling things like quest items drop more ofthen with that one. Also more items in general. I played solo for a bit and got plenty of items like bags and such. But when using group loot together, very rarely..
---
I am a bit confuse which system to use.
---
You're right brother
---
Isn't the war actually the friends we made along the way, really?
---
I mean didn't he specifically say he was only going to play for a month or two then go back to retail. Not like this wasn't expected. Personally I don't care because I think people should do whatever they want (assuming it doesn't hurt others ofc). Let him do him, and you do you.

I'm not astonished at all. They played a video game to the extreme effectiveness after practicing for a decade. The commitment is pretty easy to grasp if you're not working or living a life for those 5 days. Humans can scale mountains and build crazy machines. This is a group of guys playing a video game.

Try to Spam demo shout. Worked for me in bfd today

what an absolute unit
---
I understand. I kept telling others this too "Why do you care about what some guild has cleared?" and now here I am, wondering why it feels like private servers ruined Classic without realising that it was exactly because of them that we even got Classic in the first place. I guess I'll take the down vote plunge on this one lol
---
Yeah theres been queues on Zandalar Tribe on EU as well.
---
Yes pantheon but who knows when, Camelot Unchained (Dark age of Camelot successor) just to name a couple big named ones.
---
Gotta love the reddit echo chamber huh?
---
I leveled a troll mage in classic as my first 60. Idk who is saying they aren't as good as a warlock. Mages are so fun and have a lot of cool spells. They are a master of control in pve and polymorph is one of the best cc in the game. Stick with a mage for sure.
---
There is some sort of bug with the cultists fleeing mechanic in BFD
---
We had one run on the beach and he literally ran all the way into the warlock Chambers we had to clear the whole room with no Regen. Massive pain in the ass
---
As someone that scratched the itch and spent the last few days playing far too many hours, buying a new gaming laptop, etc.. I can say that I have wasted a lot of time and will be trying to return the laptop here shortly. :P
---
The game requires a lot of time to progress and if there's anything I've learned after decades of battling gaming addiction it is that that addiction is deeply ingrained. You should fully expect to be pulled back in the way you were years ago. Science will one day (I think it already has?) show that this vidya addiction is not something you can simply willpower through in most cases and is akin to the mental addiction of hard drugs.
---
There is literally no way and no one has ever gotten rank 14 let alone rank 10 from strictly wpvp
---
Having to walk and keep going to these places and small towns really helps bring you into the world 100%. And the amount of time you hang around them, makes it feel so much larger of a world.
---
I feel ya. It must suck being level 25 knowing there’s guilds out there who have cleared phase 1.
---
Time to delve
---
BLIZZARD gave him two choices: do this or don't play. I, for one, chose not to play on official servers. I went back to private servers so I can play with my friends and play on the same server two days in a row.  I have zero problem with him doing this.
---
It gets better don't worry. You'll have MUCH more rage to work with as you get higher and higher, for a few reasons.
---
LEATHER BELT!!!!

You already can say « wow classic experience was so nice »

Continue to enjoy the game and this relationship !
---
That's why we all play :)

so you think it's time to fucking rock and and fuckng roll, out of control?

Hunters and rogues are both good in PvP. Hunters can one shot Squishies with high enough gear.

You should delete this.. censor out the website and then reupload..
---
I don't know, it shouldn't effect me at all, I guess I haven't thought about it properly enough. Fuck it - I know it's 15 year old content anyway.
---
Bro not only are you rage starved for the first like 30 levels it does not help that one waits for you to get any threat you basically have to ping pong agro with taunt cooldowns.
---
Battlegrounds are not active yet. They are releasing the classic content in 6 phases, battlegrounds will be phase 3.
---
What would be the warriors role here? Taking the boss?
---
If your own sense of re-discovering the game is based upon everyone else also doing it, it kinda feels like you're not entirely here to re-discover the game.
---
If you base your own pleasure of the game from others achievement or lack thereof, I feel kinda bad for you. Play the game for your own sake, play because you enjoy it. Why care about stuff like this? Why give it even a second of your thought if you're here to re-discover the game?
---
The players who is completely wrecking the classic content should be praised for their effort, it's made from love of the game. It's countless hours and hours of effort and dedication.
---
Why are you letting another individuals experience "taint" your perception of the game? I don't really understand this post at all. You didn't really even provide a reasoning as to why the experience is tainted. Isn't the entire point of games like wow the fact that everyone can play how they wish to?
---
Some people are saying that Vanilla is much easier. Before I start. I don't find Vanilla or Retail difficult one bit and Retail difficulty is artificial. ( Everyones going to find content that eventually challenges you if all you do is raise the numbers high enough ).
---
Part of the difficulty in Vanilla was not because of the bosses. Was not because of the classes. But the social structure of the game itself. You see most guilds didn’t have 40 of the most capable players on the server. Most guilds had some good players, and a lot of bad ones. It was up to the good ones to teach and carry the bad ones.
---
Loyalty is a thing. Friendship was a thing. In Vanilla. No guild was going to kick out some of their worse players to make room for one of the best players of another guild. And the best players wouldn’t necessarily leave for a more progressed guild because they had loyalty for their own, or felt powerful being in their guild and at the top.
---
So. Yes. It will be a lot easier for a completely new fresh guild who has planned for classic release months in advance. Then have 40 people who have been able to devote 12+ hours a day to levelling. No one has to pull weight for their friends. No one needs to be taught tactics. No guild leader needs to stop and explain. Thanks to the marker system no one needs to waste time making sure everyones got the right target (John on X, Sue on Skull, Main Tank on Triangle, etc... ). True vanilla didn't have this marker system as it appeared towards the end of vanilla's run. You had to F-assist.
---
So yes. It's going to be cleared fast. Particularly by those players who hit 60 already. They havn't commited so much time to leveling to 60 this early to be "bad at the game".
---
Lol that's such bullshit, just stop dude. Literally the #2 post on the sub right now is about how even people who don't enjoy classic are happy that it's popular and that peoppe are enjoying it, and every single top comment is positive about classic. 
---
You people trashing retail players on this sub are like annoying kids who need to get gratification from shitting on other people's enjoymentnt who have done or said nothing bad about you.
---
That tweet in the OP is from august 21st, friend.
---
I think you should have drank Leroy First, then Jenkins.
---
regular 5 man dungeon grinding is perfectly acceptable but your tank wouldn't do enough till 37 because you can do rav shenanigans then.
---
FFXIV indeed has a lot of the same flaws as WoW Retail has, and maybe even worse in some aspects, which you also summed up well. 3 things I think FF does better than WoW Retail (my opinion): 1. The story and lore; it's vastly better than wow's. 2. Ability to play on your TV with PS4. 3. The look and feel of the world. It's an amazing world. You do have to be a fan or have a tolerance of Anime-esk cutscenes though. But without question, WoW classic is a much better MMO compared to both.
---
New servers are always cropping up, so there is a demand for them. Though that could be said for TBC and WotLK servers as well
---
Free for all loot is vital for questing, while playing with my brother i often times found that when one player completes a "Gather from mobs" objective the drop rate for the other player basically halves, it makes it so much more painful (I didnt even know about FFA until about 30 seconds ago)
---
It is. Blizzard themselves had a blue post about things bring overtuned on private servers.
---
Why does Classic blow for you, though? subscription cost?
---
How do you know these patchnotes are legitimate and not wrong/edited?
---
That option is in the game settings.
---
Pretty interesting, wonder if Blizzard is already aware. They might not think there's even a problem right now.
---
If you're not changing layer you're probably being invited to groups within your layer.
---
If you download an add on called spy, it will tell you if there’s any enemy fraction near.
---
\&gt; i mean i have 30 minutes of footage so... Yeah i went on you first whilst you was AOE farming. But this clipwas after a disengage where you then went on me... 
---
valid reason to countergank
---
\&gt;  And im not sure a frost mage beating a warrior 3 levels lower, whilst you are above 40 (huge talent and skill spike at 40), and no pvp trinkets is something to brag about!??? 
---
I just ran oom lol
---
\&gt; Title doesnt even slag you off, grow up dude. 
---
you just made an enemy for life mate, better watch out now.
---
I always try to explain stuff. The group I tanked for today wouldn't listen to a word.
---
My favorite was when they accused jokerd of account sharing without proof when they were account sharing themselves with a guy on stream going around hitting space bar to keep people from being kicked out
---
It's been 15 years and they haven't made a better game.  WotLK had the largest amount of subs, and it's been downhill since.
---
Really don't need a guide. Sunder and revenge stuff, skull a kill target, throw 1 or 2 sunders/revenge on off targets, most on the skull though. This is 90% of tanking.
---
Seems like we must have been on different layers..
---
Thanks.
---
Let him go retail. Soon on retail they will implement a new feature which will autocomplete every quest right after you accept. So you don't have to actually do the quest as it is a pain in the ass. 
---
This will im afraid make some people on retail make frustrated too, because then there is the struggle with accepting and turning quests. Would be much easier if you just got it complete upon login.
---
Few patches later you won't have to play, as everything will be done for you. You'll just have a great feeling that you're paying 15 bucks a month and your character is top tier every day without having to play as it is a struggle because it's harder than doing nothing. 
---
These people will love it.
---
Paladin powerspikes really hard in its 20s, wait it out for a bit longer. No class is 'fun' before 30.
---
Tanking everything with a shieldwall if you can, and generally kiting and taking agro its really not that simple haha, u also need dispels from stuns on giant pulls or your instant dead
---
Ah, Path of Fire questline?
---
I really need to level my classic shaman.
---
Very true. Thanks.
---
Why do people run dungeons instead of questing, is it faster?
---
I use splashtop, it is the simplest one to use that I found and is not blocked by my company, you may have to try few different programs depending on how much restriction your IT department has set up. And I have timed power on set up in bios since I tend to forget to switch the pc on before I leave the house
---
Thank you for putting so much work in your redearch. This shouldve been solved in the beta. I hope this thread will push blizzard to investigate.
---
Speak for yourself. I am happy to help people out.
---
My situation was reversed, on my server alliance and horde would often pass by each other, I even clearly recall standing within attacking distance of a group of enemy players who did not attack me, heck one of them even helped me kill the mob I was fighting.
---
I felt safe, so safe in fact that I started killing them all, even the ones who were busy fighting mobs, especially the ones fighting mobs... for the anger of being killed while fighting a mob is strongest, it will fuel their desire for revenge and conflict.
---
For I feared that safety would ruin the age old conflict between factions and the thrill that comes from battling the enemy, it needs to be fueled with hatred and that's why I had to fuel said hatred , so that the cycle can begin anew !
---
For the glory of combat, Lok'tar Ogar!
---
I just put riposte before sin strike and mine works fine.
---
The fuck? You must have been with some fucking awful rogues, I kick spam the shit out of things.
---
There’s a few servers left with no queue. My server only gets up to medium population but there’s still tons of people on!
---
Lol...
---
God so right
---
I mean, it's not but it's kinda harrowing, y'know? Like, I got my wish in a sense but it was practically Monkey Paw'd. I got Classic **BUT** it's ran by ActiBlizzard with all their fuckery, expensive as hell and there's no alternative as they destroyed the lives of those who made private servers for the love of the game. As much as I want to, I'm not buying this shit because I'm not giving these companies a fucking dime but damn man, I want to play Classic again.
---
Make sure you're at the right level to be able to get it. Like, character level
---
I wouldn't celebrate too soon. I already see people leaving back to retail.
---
Nobody is interested in threat and nobody cares that tanks need rage and everything has cooldown. There are going to be no tanks left in classic in a month.
---
So.. burning crusade. Yeah.
---
Nah, that's actually where classic is different from vanilla thanks to being run on modern WoW's engine.
---
Back in vanilla you definitely had to spam jump back up
---
well in 2006 I hadn't a great screen either, it was still a 4:3 not 16:9
---
If you use it certain areas that aren't toed to a zone it teleport you to your factions default graveyard. Ally is in westfall,  horde in durotar. I think (but I'm not sure if I remember correctly) one of these areas is the AV cave in north Hillsbrad. I think if you die in there you go to westfall.
---
I heard that there you need to wait 24 hours before you can have all the options
---
Lol ya I'm aware thanks for the advice.   I'm not 20 anymore, I know what moderation means now lol.  Besides my back can't take the long hours in front of a screen anymore.
---
Lok'tar my friend.
---
For the post 30-40 leveling, having rested XP built up is a huge boon to feeling like your pace isn't so slow. That being said, some levels do really feel like they drag if you are rushing to get to max
---
I did every quest in shimmering flats as alliance without getting attacked a single time. Just gotta hit em with the /wave and throw a dot on the mob they're fighting.
---
You are over exaggerating the difficulty immensely. I don’t care who the people are, if you have 3 mages with brains you can figure it out to be at least somewhat efficient. It’s not like you’d be efficiently questing either or leveling fast at all if you can’t figure out how to instance farm
---
Tagging
---
Tracking 5 is a Blizzard limit, no addon will be able to do more.
---
I think Zul'farrak played a big role in hitting 60 quickly
---
I think they were talking about the fact not everyone was even max level the bosses have never been mechanically hard. If you check the old world firsts the majority of every raid is cleared within 1-2 days with a bugged boss or mechanic cock blocking players for the majority of time afterwards. 
---
Now give these guys time to farm their bis when theyre 20ish manning MC to maximize gear theyre going to shit on the next raid tier.
---
I just set my hearth there.  Take them on foot for 15 mins from no where with no fps nearby, nadda, and then I hearth and go where o really want to fish but I don't get my pole out till I'm there.
---
Someone is a little booty tickled.
---
[Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler), I presume.
---
I just don’t understand why you had to bring race into it.
---
That might be a mental thing. I know I've looted quest items from corpses that are other player's in group loot.
---
and the economy. All the extra BOE gear from drops, and less demand do to everybody having every single rare drop from these instances.
---
How am I supposed to sell my greens on the AH now.
---
I would say just don't run with those elitist groups. There will be toxic players in any gaming community
---
I don't think there is anything wrong with laying out expectations for your group - you are investing multiple hours into some dungeons, and having a bad player can mean the group wipes too many times = whole group falls apart. It also does not feel good to be doing a dungeon where 2 DPS &amp; the tank are carrying 1 other DPS who is doing 25% their damage.. Don't get me wrong flaming a player for making a mistake isn't okay, but wanting to run with good players who don't wipe the group / do more damage I don't think is unreasonable.
---
It's unavoidable. Many people are going to leave Classic.
---
And many people will choose to stay.
---
Im unaware of this tipsout drama, can anyone go into detail about him and what hes done?
---
Who cares? Go away
---
You'll find, as you go through this life, that lots of stupid people give a shit about lots of stupid things that they really shouldn't.
---
Maybe you shouldnt accept to tank if you cant think about mana
---
*Faps furiously over classic*
---
Get that retail trash out of here my dude
---
White hit 3 times, finally enough rage for Sunder Armor.
---
*Miss*
---
Ooo what server?
---
i noticed i can not even have dinner and get kicked out of the game.   
---
they defently changed sth , what is good ..
---
K bro
---
I'm a mage. Should I buy all the spells from the trainer?
---
I thought I was only supposed to get flame spells if I was a flame specialist, and frost if that, etc.. but there are so few spells that I feel it isn't helping me not to buy them.
---
I thought there would be a skill tree to specialize in. That's what I see when I Google levelling guides, but I don't see one in game.
---
I'm just confused on leveling and how to create builds. Any explanations would be appreciated.
---
Private servers all shut down so I'm left with this unauthentic bullshit called Classic.
---
's are straight
---
Can I ask what your team comp was?
---
Hahah, I was hoping for more triggered people I’m ngl
---
And contextually it was found that he said that as a joke, which is why Method had to walk back their accusations.
---
You think blizz dedicated resources to a nearly two year development project for something they determined would be a fad? There is certainly more to come, we just don't know what yet.
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
I'm trying to heal as a shaman too. It hasnt been easy so far. Doesnt take much to go oom
---
I see your point and you try see the best on the bad things. The thing is, I'm loving my character otherwise I would not care about this.
---
&gt; A small nerf 1 month after first kill is hardly "massively nerfed from 1.1 to 1.12". That's just misleading
---
Please refer to original link for the full list of changes. I only provided one example.
---
just type /reload every time you ding or feel like it's not working, works for me :p
---
I kept it in mind, I just overlooked it once, the party was understanding and I know its my fault lol
---
&gt;be smart enough
---
&gt;actually a walking corpse
---
Alls in order here.
---
It was part of vanilla but there were no servers with 12k people on them so it will eventually not be like this.
---
Stupid people are easily influenced. Water is also wet. More at 11.
---
This right here. Doing both will give you the boost you need when it gets too tough.
---
Rockbiter is really good damage though. Probably worth the risk.
---
Whats wrong oO
---
I think that you have to ask how long is it possible for an MMO to be successful. It certainly would need to change and evolve. Although there are things about retail that i dont like they certainly have kept pouring into it. there are many things I do like about it esp the environments.
---
Currently i'm playing Classic. Speaks more to the roots and takes me back to the wonder of starting Wow. Altho that was at the first exp...Belfs and all lol.  I think there is plenty of room for both to win and awesome for Blizz to give players what they want. Would be interested down the road a bit to see if overall the player base grows or if it just shifts.
---
I'll enjoy Classic and I like the Mechagon environment so I will eventually go back at times. Its all fun.
---
What realm? Herod is a nightmare with 8k on non peak times and Fairbanks (my server) with 1500-3k on non peak times
---
Wow nice! I remember progress raising through Nax 25, and left with several people for a guild called Naissaince i think. Good times!
---
Not everyone has a super high cost pc. My laptop can't handle recording &amp; it's too much work compared to just pressing one button on my phone. That is why.
---
This is true, but you also gain XP faster from 44-60. You'll have a mount which reduces travel time, plus everything rewards more XP. Sure the time to level will increase every level, but it's not like you hit 44 in four days of played time and then need another 4 days of played time to hit 60.
---
Imo there are 2 types of raid guild, the hardcore's who potion/flask up, stack world buffs basically just min max as hard as they can, and the casual raid guilds. Getting into a hardcore raid guild as a boomkin will just as difficult as it was in 2004, but the casual raid guilds will snap up anyone who is competent and can show up on time.
---
This would be the end of the world.... of Warcraft.
---
It's 2019 dog everyone uses discord
---
Nothing it really set besides skull and X, which basically first and second kills. Usually for the others you set it up with the group, like sheep moon or sap circle and such. That way they know to do it every pull.
---
In fact I want Blizzard to make changes to retail based on the popularity of Classic, not for it to just die, but sadly unless changes are implemented to retail it will end up dying just because there's a more fun alternative where the MMO part of MMORPG actually feels like it exist and you are not just playing a game where you just queue up in the dungeon finder and the closest thing to human interaction you are gonna see is the tank calling the healer retard cuz he died when he pulled to many mobs
---
Knowing the leveling speed at around 50 I'm pretty sure this will put him back at 49.
---
Nancy the Gnome, i look forward to it. Least you have a fitting guild name.
---
Interrupt? Lmao
---
Personally, from what you wrote, I would recommend you a druid. A druid in his first 10 levels however is completely different to the next levels. And the playstyle changes a lot in the twenties again.
---
However, as a druid you'd be super hybrid. You can heal, you have relatively easy leveling and farming, etc. The main problem of the druid is, to be not a very good raider. But as you at most want to do an occasional raid, I would recommend druid.
---
Reading this makes me wonder if you invented time travel. A Fortnite fanboy (presumably) becoming addicted to classic WoW. I'll be watching in October to see if you make a post about how you're addicted to p99's green Everquest server. I'M ON TO YOU, MCFLY!
---
I can tell by that you've never played another MMO, even without you saying. Anyone who played modern MMOs would see classic offering the same content only with more difficulty and thus find it offputting, but if you've never played MMOs it makes sense. Definitely not "super social" though. Literally no reason to ever speak to anyone aside from LFG/LFMs and in raids. WoW isn't a social MMO, it *killed* social MMOs.
---
Whitemane.
---
I just want something that shows how much items sell for, so I'll know what to ditch when my bag gets full. And maybe some kind of Auctioneer add-on.
---
Anyone know if something like that is available?
---
Way simpler than I thought it would be, thanks.
---
What addons are those? Your game looks so detailed compared to mine
---
Thanks, that's wat simpler than I thought it would be, haha.
---
You got to sunder??
---
I had to suffer a rogue using expose armour even when told not to and why...
---
/cancelform
---
I'm a mage fam, see you in Dire Maul LUL
---
It's the same concept. Why does it make sense to watch football? You can just as easily play it yourself instead after all. No need to watch others.
---
I watched it from the starts (i'm in EU) and the casters during EU prime time were saying like every other sentance that Method was not racing as a guild and that only a few players at the event were actually trying to race (Like Kennymarch). And that others like Kungen and more where there mostly for the entertainment and not to race them selves. 
---
Maybe casters during your watch times were less clear (i don't know where you are from ofcourse).
---
Zandalar Tribe
---
I can tell you're right by the way you used not one but *two* laughing emojis.
---
Thanks, that's way easier than I thought it would be.
---
Then install the mod?
---
Haha but Method as a guild is not competing in anything in Classic therefore they couldn't have gotten "stomped". You can't loose a race you don't run in. So who is the fanboy here...
---
Also this whole idea of WF in Classic is ridiculously stupid. The world firsts were done years ago.
---
The only game that I've played that gave me that same solid wow feel was wildstar, but a shame nobody jumped on :(
---
Thats a pretty shield in the middle which I assume you cant get in retail now.
---
Anyone know the name of it?
---
I'll take messing with my friends over Virtual fishing any day dude LOL
---
Players created quest helper, item level, the pre-made group finder, and more.
---
the chances that you did something that requires gm intervention is close to 0
---
Then stop complaining about the queues, buddy. You had plenty of time to convince your friends to roll somewhere else. Suck it up
---
 It's a lot easier to accept the end of a relationship when you have something to fill the void.  I knew with my addictive personality and the reemergence of Classic WoW, it wouldn't be difficult to stay distracted.  Up until this point, I tried to avoid being alone, at all cost.   What I'm saying is that the emergence of something that would occupy my time and distract me forced me to finally let go of control of this situation.  That distraction could have been career, another woman, anything.  In this case, it was Classic WoW.
---
I am not saying that Classic WoW literally saved my relationship.  I'm saying that having something that I believe would be an effective distraction gave me confidence to let go and let things play out however they needed to.
---
Well my friends and I don't... thanks for the impute bro.
---
fuck greenskins
---
Might want to make that into a macro for in game
---
Even after 15 years you can't equip bracers in the belt slot.
---
Yeah mon!
---
/Cast Moonfire
---
Ohh ok...
---
Didn't he spam kill monsters
---
Run past a few skull alliance players in zones I was trying to get flightpaths in for the future and just waved and hope they don't kill me lol. Didn't die that day. Great strat
---
And ty for the advice. You are not like the other retard people saying (change realm) who don't know some people have less time to play on the game were grind is basically the game. I tried go to the lowest populated realm in the day I pay just to have my name. Double trap, pay to have a name in a server were I cannot play.
---
Lmao, I do this to my wife constantly.
---
"RUN! A GROUP JUST SPAWNED"
---
I was happy to see it, dickhead :)
---
She is so niceeee
---
They were yes. But raids are very different now. A classic raid in its entirety has way less mechanics than a single heroic raid boss in retail.
---
If you highlight the food/water in your bag after conjuring, the tooltip will tell you the minimum level requirement to use it. Not really answering your question as to an addon or list already available but it's an easy way to at least have the game tell you itself. I would just write it down on a notepad nearby or make a quick .txt file myself.
---
Will they introduce a server change in the future?
---
HUH!
---
You are though! You made these.
---
I'm a priest too but I'm not as salty as everyone else in this thread. It was a meme post, lighten up
---
the real play is to r1 buff the other person to bait them into giving you a full rank buff back
---
This was good advice.  Thank you.  In a way, I think that's what I did.
---
Shit just got real OP !
---
RP servers, not even once.
---
Why? I am playing classic now and I know I don't have to worry about blizzard shutting it down in 2 months. I know the players playing are paying monthly and care what happens so they can't just bot and get banned.
---
This is as close to 2005 wow as we'll get and I'm loving it.
---
Playing ret instead of staying holy in favor of a mage or a rogue is just wasting 39 other ppls time
---
Its the "New Coke" "Classic Coke" marketing strategy. New coke when it came out was universally hated that when Classic coke came back it was sold out for months. I personally cant wait for the server q time to lessen. I just want them to keep the skill tree concept through out the new content I hope they do
---
He’s literally arguing the difficulty of the raids, not how good the game is you twat. Obviously classic wow is the better game
---
Probably. 2 and 3 pulls are very manageable but tanks don't really have the toolkit to maintain threat on 4+ mobs in vanilla unless they're stacking reflective damage consumables.
---
&gt;Hell yeah! You’ll meet people along the way and join a guild, hop in a discord and make some friends!
---
Do not get your hopes up. There is an extremely slim chance this will happen now. Guilds are no longer recruiting for leveling, they are recruiting for end game. If you have not already been keeping up with the server no one is going to come help you. You will always be expected to play solo until you catch up. Do no expect anyone in the wild to join you. You missed the opportunity to find a leveling partner. If you are looking for a leveling partner though I'd be more than happy to join. I have tried leveling on Faerlina, Deviate Delight, Grobbulus, Westfall, and Thalnos, and I'm about ready to try the next server on the list. Every single community behaves the same way. I've joined a guild on Grobbulus and even with a decently sized guild there was not a single person willing to level unless they got xp out of it.
---
Attached to one of the most powerful team's in the genre. 
---
Nobody is going to know "David from Management at Target" online. But you bring up "Tupac on Flamelash with Method", people will at least know the team.
---
Oh no easy Enrage procs? Guess the Paladin Reckoning bomb is out too.
---
/run command runs a lua statement like a mod would do.  This just puts a short function in that statement.  
---
This is what it looks like with indentation,  
---
    /run  
---
        for i=0,4 do  //for every bag  
---
            for x=1,GetContainerNumSlots(i) do  // for every slot in the bag     
---
                y=GetContainerItemLink(i,x)  // get a handle to the item in that slot    
---
                if y then   // check to see if that item exists  
---
                    if GetItemInfo(y)=="Minor Healthstone" then  //check to see that the item name is "healthstone"   
---
                        PickupContainerItem(i,x);  // put item on cursor
---
                        DropItemOnUnit("target");   // drop item on cursor onto target.   This triggers a trade window for players.    
---
                        return;  // early out to stop searching through bags.    
---
                    end  
---
               end  
---
          end  
---
    end    
---
    /click TradeFrameTradeButton   // automatically click trade.  I'm surprised blizz has this as an option, it seems exploitable.
---
I've seen it happen, but it's very rare. Most people know what they're signing up for in a vanilla dungeon.
---
Teach them mechanics, not manners.
---
I was just checking to see if there were any updates to this addon and I see, "Removed per author's request."
---
Shamans hit really hard compared to pservers. Threat is 1:1 for dammage. Even if ur spamming sunder and revenge, you won’t hold aggro against an ench shaman auto attacking things.
---
yeah nobody really played meme specs on private servers because people were really elitist about it. classic will be different due to the sheer population and number of guilds, most people playing aren't snobs.
---
Just like how retail will go to the 0 players by 2009, right?
---
With an optimized group, probably dungeons.  That said, you miss out on a lot of the experience by just dungeon grinding.
---
who the fuck would sponsor that guy? and where can i see how many subs he has
---
Me too lol
---
Thats gonna be my next mouse :) get well soon!
---
Your talking about such a small portion of the player base. The majority of the players who will be raiding Molten Core will NOT be first time raiders.
---
Check the official boards, you have to choose your faction and realm to get in touch with old guildies
---
Same here, although it was techinally TBC but the quests were the same.
---
Tried taming a prairie dog prior to learning companion pets are different from actual hunter pets.
---
I mean I dont include the orc shaman which fell into the waters outside ratchet, got killed by a Level ?? shark and then deleted his hearthstone.
---
im not even in a party lol
---
This is ASMR
---
Are you dumb? I mean seriously you don't see how ridiculous it is to expect someone to trash all the hours they put in to restart somewhere else, and hope they can convince their friends to as well, and guildies. Only to have the new server you start on fill up in a day and have the same exact thing happen...
---
Oh for sure. I remember doing farming runs in Strat for example, at 60 and we would just run through the place, kill all the things, reset and do it again. But we were all 60, everyone had atleast all blues or some tier 0 and we could basically do that, but WC with a group of undergeared characters on a brand new realm where no one can twink their characters, going face first into three packs of mobs when your healer can't even get out of combat to drink because WC is buggy - I mean, you see the difference.
---
That's what I've been doing but I can't watch it all the time. So frustrating.
---
It is on the 1.12 balance patch.  All classes and loot are balanced around the final patch.  The bosses haven't been touched if that ever happened in vanilla but players are more poweful than they were at release.
---
The instant mail on same account wasn't added til after classic.
---
It’s already too ingrained.
---
&gt;Retail is bad because it's easy
---
&gt;I like Vanilla
---
Pick one. You cannot defend Vanilla's difficulty anymore. We have solid proof that it is mechanically a cakewalk.
---
Classic is great, I love Classic, but I will never be the one boomer in the corner of world first Mythic clear posts screaming about how it took him 500 times to down Onyxia, and how now WoW is super duper easy. You were bad. Everyone was bad. Face it.
---
im really pissed atm ... I went to go to lunch because the q was 2 and 1/2 hours (I started on the sever at medium pop a few days ago .. i dont care about streamers or any other kind I want to play the game ... just to see ther server being full after 3 days) ... now i come back in time got dcd and now i wait another 1 1/2 hours to get to play a game I pay for? ... 
---
I love classic ... but how they manage the servers and the amount of paying people just shows thats its the same cash cow when they started to change wow to get more money ... they dont care about customers or the players ... they care about their fkn money and although I love classic I am not sure if paying for this is worth it
---
I've had one but my buddies all mentioned they've had several.
---
Shouldn't be a problem at all, all that consecration etc is going to kick ass.
---
It'll be slow though. Real fucking slow with all those retadins :D
---
Can I ask why? I've seen quite a few people that are determined to play on the super overpopulated servers. I have a friend that has actually changed his sleep schedule so that he goes to bed when he gets home from work, just so he can play 5 hours later after he's finally in the server. I don't get it. I understand that people want a high pop server, but waiting for hours just to get in to the game is asinine.
---
As a kid I've always found this super strange! Growing up it made more sense but as a kid it fucked me up!
---
Taunt
---
*Resist*
---
Wait 8 seconds. Taunt again
---
OK, fuck this. Switch stance, Mocking Blow
---
Did mc, ony, bwl, aq20, and some of aq40 in original classic. Mechanics werent that hard then really, the hard part was people being retarded, getting all 40 people in vent to shut up to hear the raid leader explain the fight for someone new, new players not knowing how to play their class, new people coming in undergeared, afks, ragers, loot fights(even with dkp, there are always some complaints), etc. The hardest parts of raiding really were less to do with the raid in particular and more with raiding in general.
---
HA no way.
---
Every now and then it's ok to buy weapon upgrades.  Even white items if it's a big dps jump.  I wouldnt bother with armor though.
---
Why 48?
---
says the dude thats never touched naxx, and 90% of heroic pugs require you to have already cleared the raid on heroic lol, so you are just overgearing it. can't do that shit with naxx
---
Anyone else find it disturbing that he was raised by Onyxia and the future Lich King? Is Anduin the real threat?
---
Mine was pretty toxic for a while. Lots of political discussions that were getting pretty vulgar. 
---
It suddenly stopped a few days ago though. I think a lot of people got banned.
---
Who cares anyway about streamers. I dont understand why people make a big deal about it. Its a regular playing a game.
---
wow thats insane! congrats!
---
I find it worse that people apparently can't be trusted to even read. No help is required, just a brain.
---
Go to battle.net in a browser. Log in, then go to manage account. You should see two. One that should have active sub, one that is just the Starter Edition. Then when you open thw desktop app for battle.net there should be a drop down select to pick which account you want to use.
---
And thats a fine view to have.
---
But let's say that the 33 shadow spell dmg ring from BWL drops. Is it going to benefit the overall raid damage more to give it to a warlock or a shadow priest?
---
Shadow priests don't really do a lot of damage and their job is to keep shadow weaving up. Warlocks spam shadow bolts all day. 
---
There's just no doubt that the ring is put to better use on the warlock. 
---
it might just be 1 item for 1 player so that's not going to make a big difference but in the large scale of things, if you make this priority, the raid will perform better.
---
Some people prefer to play that way. That has nothing to do with being entitled or ruling over others. That's all I'm saying.
---
Is there a way to turn this on? It somehow doesnt show for me and im sad about it since LvL 1 :(
---
I got the belt from there today on my lock was psyched. Lost the roll for the shoulders tho which was a bummer because shoulders are so hard to come by
---
Just make sure the first tick of damage occurs after the warrior has some threat established. Warriors in classic at low levels can struggle to establish threat if their attacks do not hit as that's their primary method of rage generation that's not on a longish 1m cooldown. If you see sunder armor on a target that should be enough to start your full damage rotation.
---
I prefer killing them on the island. There's more wriggling room.
---
This is animal abuse and not a fun little thing to share for laughs
---
This is why I went with caffeine pills.
---
You can go on the zeppelin in Durotar to go to the undead starting area. There you can go down to Silverpine forest and level as well. You should've gotten a few quests in the barrens to go to silverpine as well.
---
What's the point of layering if they are just going to remove layering but keep the same population?
---
I’m a warrior too, do you reckon it’s better to just grind in the 30s I feel like I’m just running from zone to zone
---
having a bad day? take it out on yourself not others.
---
It took me months of streaming myself to figure this out because I was never interested in watching streams myself. It's about being part of a community and less about watching somebody entertaining or good at a game.
---
&gt;  if you are the sort of player to do speed runs like this and complete "all content" in 5 days then you are most likely the kind of player who is constantly chasing the carrot on the stick and you never want to reach it...
---
See, I look at it the completely opposite way.
---
If you're someone who speed runs you're the kind of person capable of setting your own goals and doesn't have to be spoon fed one.
---
Have them send it to you and open it once you have the money that dagger nuci worth so much gold you should have bought it
---
They tried taking away flying once, people immediately went apeshit and that was reverted.
---
Do you know anyone IRL in the game or are attached to people on that server? I would just move servers. I'm on Kirtonos, never any queues.
---
Meaning the only one who can kill WoW is Blizzard itself?
---
I'm assuming OP was in bear or cat form
---
The hard thing about letting someone die is that generally the only res we have is my 30 min cooldown, and I don't want to waste it on a dps but I also don't want to wait 15 minutes till he walks back :) That's why I'm happy to see paladin tanks or priest dps in the dungeons so far.
---
Someone to take an economics class lol. You guys are all making yourself look like idiots
---
That’s too fast for 60%
---
this.. upsets me. 
---
i'm still standing my ground. dunno what they were thinking when they decided that the only dungeon in the game to be called by the last boss should be deadmines.
---
I was killing syndicate dudes solo in Arathi, had to take 'em slow but it was going well. In rolls this warrior with a priest on his ass, pulls 7 mobs and lives to tell the tale. Absolutely nuts.
---
Ok first off: fuck streamers, nobody cares.
---
Second: all of them do this. Literally look at old school runescape. People throw money at streamers. People give them free bonds for membership and all their rares. There’s streamers with over max cash on osrs from just begging followers.
---
Gaming culture has changed. That’s the problem. Everyone has to have everything handed to them with zero work, and they want to do everything as efficiently as possible. The only way you’re allowed to play is to be a frost mage or a cleave warrior and do dungeons. Nobody wants to watch a streamer who isn’t doing that, and you’re not competing if you’re not.
---
On retail it’s the same. Nobody gives a shit about you if you’re not raiding mythic in the world first race or playing 2400+ arena. If you’re not doing that shit you’re irrelevant and might as well not play. That’s why everyone quit retail.
---
Lol only 45
---
“These both spark joy.”
---
Plus, the world is just *fun* to explore. I have played less time since the launch of Cats than the time before by a large margin because the original world was so enjoyable, and once they literally blew it up the magic was just gone.
---
The content in WoW Classic is being released in phases to emulate the original content release schedule. Right now, in phase 1, killing people of the opposing faction does not have any significance outside, well, killing them. In the upcoming phase 2 there will be a reward system for PVP where kills of the opposing faction will be awarded with Honor points.
---
I don't really mind flying as long as it's an endgame mechanic
---
I liked how they did it in Wrath where you didn't get it until 80
---
The desired class is actually warrior.
---
Cleave groups are still superior. 3 warr, shaman, priest if you're horde.
---
except on retail you thats only done for raids people have already cleared, and are wearing gear way above the tier for because titanforging exists. and its not 40 people its like 10. not very hard to find 10 semi competent overgeared people that have already cleared the raid on heroic and call it a pug. pretty different to find 40 people that haven't cleared it before and who physically cannot overgear the instance because better gear doesn't exist.
---
Nahh they don't. I don't heal warlocks that hurt themselves. If they hurt themselves they better bandage themselves up. I only heal them if I am right now on 100% mana.
---
Awesome. Thanks for breaking that down. Appreciate it.
---
Totally agree.  I'd love to see this game as is, but with retail's graphics.
---
Just got the DM quests and I can’t wait to start healing.
---
&gt;sure, but if they were designed to be "viable raid tanks" then they would be viable raid tanks.
---
It's possible for them to have an intended design that doesn't work out, it happens all the time in games and WoW is no different.
---
&gt; so what? they have armor - surely this is an indication that they were meant to take damage, yes? i mean yeah, they aren't able to compete with warriors in raids but neither can druids or pallys so where do we draw the line?
---
When the class literally has abilities that specifically generate threat and have a spec that further improves that and survivability.
---
I mean if you really want to be anal about it then we could exclude druids but Paladins literally have a tanking spec with the same name as the Warrior's and it does nothing except improve the Paladin's ability to survive and generate threat, are you saying that doesn't indicate a clear design intention for them to be tanks?
---
Those places are actually a really good grinding spot. Just tag mobs and kite them to the group and someone will kill them for you.
---
I got venomstrike from wc at level 20, im still using it at 35. How good of a replacement should i be keeping an eye out for? Its 9.6dps without procs and it seems better than the 12 dps stuff im coming along.
---
yup its really bad.  a lot of the time NOTHING is spawning in, and then at other times its like infinite respawns, or big groups spawning on top of you.  it's immersion breaking and gets you killed
---
That doesn't mean they aren't raids.
---
Kurinnaxx no queues
---
Small tip, don't heal warlocks who do this. Either they know what they are doing and can take care of themselves. Or they will learn to.
---
How would you know that? They don't want to move now because it means completely restarting, if you give them the option to move their character a metric fuck ton of people would switch to not have to deal with 4 hour ques.
---
Hey I just finished that quest earlier
---
Not sure about the 30s, I only just hit 29 at 1 day 22 hours played. I'm definitely no paragon of speed but I'm not too slow either
---
I'm new to WoW. Played Retail for about a year. Is this shift sustainable? I don't want to play a dead game (RS3 v OSRS comes to mind), should I be making plans to stay on Classic? I don't get a ton of time to game, so I have to be careful where I put my hours.
---
The only meme spec that is as useless as you are implying is a melee hunter. Will a boomkin deal less damage over a longer fight than a mage? Yeah, probably. They also have mana problems beyond a 4 minute fight but most bosses dont last that long in vanilla. Meanwhile for sacrificing a little bit of straight numbers you have another battle rez in the raid, an extra 3% crit for your caster party and off heals in a crunch. Ret paladin isnt a rogue or warrior but they have decent off heals, blessings are important, specially if you are low on paladins and auras for much flexibility in assisting the party/raid. Most importantly, if you are min maxing classic raids outside of Naxx, you are doing it very wrong.
---
I'm so glad I switched. I had no queue last night at 8 pm.
---
That’s why the tank always marks his target with a skull.
---
I can't imagine how big those queues are for Whitemane and Herod. Fairbanks had 11,000 in the first few days and that was a fairly lowkey server that happened to be in the first batch of them.
---
Go to a lower pop server.
---
Unfortunately I don't know why it randomly disconnects. It just seems to be an issue with blizzard servers. If there is a solution I don't believe anyone has found it. Not until the population falls more.
---
May be updating their auto non-afk detection methods.
---
Itt: mad jelly bois
---
The question was regarding code. Specifically asking about long one has been able to submit code. While you’re right (nobody said you were wrong), macros don’t enable or require this feature. 
---
So coding in WoW is unrelated to macros specifically and then in the screenshot we have a (non-macro) slash command that accepts arbitrary Lua code (the coding part) as a line in a macro.
---
Both of these trigger you if you are part of the private server salt.
---
Nothing official but tons of census data in discords and server subreddits. Nearly always the same as private servers - Warrior, Mage, big group of everyone else, and then druid last.
---
Dog shit argument
---
"We thought highly of you" speak for yourself man, always thought he was a giant turd
---
Not everyone wants to group just because you do. Let people play how they want to play. It's not a bad thing they said no. Maybe they've had a bad experience where someone wanted to group and then ninja looted a BoE, or sat AFK on follow, or whatever. Or maybe they want to do the entire of their leveling solo, no exceptions. Or maybe, just maybe, they don't have a reason and that's ok
---
they've probably been lured away by the Classic Legion private servers
---
am I the only one who remembers low level dungeons being really fucking easy back then too
---
Most common solution is to use the booty bay neutral auction house. List a gray item like a boar tooth for however much money you want to trade, and then buy it with your alt-faction character.
---
Yes, kicked me when I was at the toilet. Not just to the char screen but completely as dc’d
---
Can't start eating in combat and I don't think it will kick you out of eating when the group enters combat.
---
As far as eating etiquette goes just try to be done eating as soon as you can to keep the group chugging along. If you're not dps'n what's the point? But gotta eat sometimes too.
---
Ahh i see, makes sense, thank you for explaining.
---
Lucky bastard in my guild got one on his first kill, so they do indeed drop.
---
Do you have gametime ?
---
Yeah, I've been leveling feral with the intent of tanking. My wife is running enhancement. She can rip aggro off me if she crits and I didn't open with wrath and moonfire.
---
Convincing argument, but I'll will pass thanks.
---
You can only give items to your other characters by either trading them to someone who gives them to you (not recommended unless you trust them), or by simply mailing them to your other characters.
---
There is no cross faction trading or mailing. There also is no cross-realm/server mailing either.
---
Yourselves**
---
By vendor do you mean selling on the AH? Or do vendors pay more than players atm?
---
Specs in the category of "either sub-optimal or outright useless".
---
What spells should I skip learning/training while leveling up as frost mage?
---
I'm a warlock, I don't believe in kindness. Maybe if I look the cut of their jib i'll give them some Detect Lesser Invisibility
---
Good?
---
Both are slow to level, but if that's your end goal you're going to have a far easier time as a casual player being taken for BGs, wpvp groups and raids as a holy paladin. Rogues have their place but aren't super high demand and a lot of people are playing them.
---
Oi! You're no dwarf!
---
I don’t know Blizzard’s move after Classic if it stays successful. It basically proves the OG is better than retail, but how do you add new content to Classic to keep people engaged that wasn’t there 15 years ago? Start rereleasing expansions?
---
Honestly, I‘d like to see WoW 2 with the gameplay of Classic but with modern QoL improvements and graphics.
---
Aight
---
is there a way to know though? Like how can you manually do that?
---
BfA is a pile of commercial bullshit.  There have been real missteps before - e.g. most of Warlords - and commercialization/dumbing down of the game - e.g. Cataclysm - but no just pure selling out, no complexity, RNG-slot machine, bilking fan base like BfA.
---
Classic represented developers making a deep, immersive, compelling, gargantuan game.
---
Yeah everything I read says it’s worth it. But I do have three other characters at level fiveish from rage quitting the warrior. Back on it today tho.
---
Horde zones are the exact opposite, groups of five all waiting on the same quest mob. It's pretty fire.
---
Like any kind of regional sports event then.
---
You draw the line where it needs to be to not ruin the game.
---
Vanilla rebalanced classes constantly. Almost every major match had a class rework.
---
150 is the expert level. Journeyman is 75. You need to find higher trainer - If I remember correctly after expert trainer you need to go to artisan trainer
---
I am unsure what "gametime" is.
---
Play what you want. You pay your sub fee. People will discriminate against you though because thats just how people are about min maxing. In reality, ret is fine in MC and the bosses are still just as easily killable. An extra 50 dps isnt going to make or break a 40 man fight, these people are comparing themselves to hyper optimized 22 warrior comps on private servers trying to speed run raids because they are literally bored. Its sad to see people being exclusive in classic wow... I saw a "boomkin" get denied to a Dead Mines run yesterday because "meme spec". Ret is great in pvp too, enjoy.
---
It's the worst sound effect in the game
---
I wish they'd just remove it, less than half a debuff slot per player is absurd, and if the "meme" specs are that bad what does it matter?
---
Question is, was it per zone or global? Because to me it seems like blizz did something wrong and it triggers when not meeting reqs. I got repeatedly melted by insta-respawn mobs in zones where there were 5-10 players on /who
---
This is native 5k btw so 100% res scale
---
Enjoy getting phished.

smells like a troll

---
35 year old father of two with full time job and my own business , I don’t give a flying fuck for the most part what people around me do or think in general, much less streamers :) 
---
 Most of the people my age I know are the same
---
But dont worry, we assure you that we are using premium netcode and premium server space!
---
I don't understand the issue. It's free, its convenient, and most players use it. Its like you're holding on to your horse and buggy when everyone is passing you in their cars.
---
You dont get kicked out of drinking unless you enter combat.
---
You dont immediately enter combat when your party does.
---
But if you get hit by any AOE ability or take damage or anything like that you will be in combat.
---
Yup. Gotta run to the zeppelin then run over to Brill. Anyone can lvl where they wanna. Just gotta get there. Heh.
---
everytime someone would argue to never call it DM i would always say "if im 19 looking for DM why the hell would I or anyone think I mean dire maul?"
---
If they can get Pathfinder, they can trivially get exalted with Argent Dawn.
---
Eq’s was better in it’s hayday. They had raids that were well beyond 40 man in size &amp; there were no instances. So you’d have 100’s of people in the same shared space creating logs.
---
In short, yes, but you may have trouble getting a level one orc toon over to that part of the world without dying a bunch during the journey...
---
Well, you are on r/wowclassic...
---
About time they fixed this.
---
Warlocks &gt; druids all day long though
---
"i'm entitled to getting help with every little thing ever because i pay a yearly sub"
---
- you, 2019
---
Sure, some of the reputation comes from 2004 but a lot of it comes from private servers, which all had 1.12 talents, as well.
---
I wonder why. You are using. So many periods? :)
---
well the Druid Gift of the Wild buff is so powerful that they're worth it in a party just for that.  a feral druid casing Gift of the Wild brings so much more damage to a raid than a plain rogue does that it's frankly a little bit silly
---
so what was the issue i was having?
---
How long were you gone would you estimate?
---
And that's cool too. You do you pookie. I just wish everyone would just enjoy it and stop complaining that the "community feel" of Classic isn't exactly what they hoped. Internet culture has evolved a lot since 2004
---
I mean rag kill had 2 ret pallies in the top damage ya doof. Go back to retail with the elitist bullshit and leave it there.
---
Keep us updated. I’d like to know as well. Also. What’s the link I’d like to see this as well. I might know what it is
---
An active wow subscription

?? But you don’t get back bag space.

Good luck!  A huge part of my launch guild reformed, after we busted up in TBC.   Great to see how many old friends have returned :)
---
Hydra ? You can flame as much as you want but even if he was only top 100 (probably more like top 20） that's still top  0.00001% of wow players
---
his post is a little more than an opinion and more like hes trying to speak for the community.
---
A group is a team. Not healing the warlock because he life tapped is hurting your team. I understand if things are getting heated and you’re using all your mana to keep the tank alive but you have Warlock Joe in the back turning 80% of his health into mana. But if it’s a pull where you’re not struggling to heal the group, might as well keep him healed up so he can do more damage.
---
It's a one time $37 fee. Why not just pay for it?
---
They need to just "un-Modernize" each expansion. 
---
Bassically for BC and WotLK the only things that are huge points of contention are flying mounts and every class having access to every type of Crowd Control. And the only bad class decision imo was that Warlocks had a near 1-button spec. 
---
And keep WotLK talents but then go "wide" Instead of Deeper after that. 
---
More importantly ensure that the "milestone" talents aren't drastically stronger than previous ones, that way hybrid specs are okay....
---
Cya
---
Ashes of Creation looks pretty good.
---
Have you ever played before?

The main challenge comes because you have no gear. Once you get greens and blues the game gets way easier.

Ouch. Imagine idolizing a man child who plays a game all day, every day.  I feel for his viewers who have no other light in their lives.

Thanks for answers, I got a orc there right now and I don't see any quests given by the npcs. Do I have to grind up to lvl 5 then take quests at brill?

---
I didn't do much PvE unfortunately because there was a level cap and you could level up in PvP, so I spent all my time doing that. It was unique though because battles were between dozens of players on each side, sometimes in open fields, and sometimes during castle sieges. Fights were an intense tug-of-war match, and everyone was low level so the fights each lasted a while. With a small group, we ended up discovering an exploit where the mobs would spawn almost instantly, and milked that goose to no end. I was probably one of the first 5 players in the entire beta to cap out. Within a week though, everyone knew the trick.
---
My gf left me before wow classic. Feelsbadman.  You're the real Mvp young lady, keep it up
---
How much would you say they sell for, I got one on my alliance toon and having a hard time guessing the value as I think one of the few people who have it currently.
---
Bro it can’t be more clear than how he put it...
---
I was more just thinking how to handle mages in my group, as a tank. I don't want to have unreasonable expectations, but I want them to be drinking during a pull rather than after one most of the time. 
---
Obviously, you can't start telling people what they should be doing if you don't understand the mechanics of the situation, but if the healer is 80% and the mage is OOM, I sure as hell don't wanna stop.
---
Haha unfortunately that’s still space bar
---
The logical route - the path of least resistance - would be to bring out a slightly altered/improved TBC.   
---
That would be the least controversial way forward (by far). I'm therefore 99% certain that is what Blizzard will do.  
---
How much altered will TBC classic be? That's a different question. The game certainly had its flaws in end-game raiding (massive amounts of respawning trash, warlocks as the only viable AoE class) but those would be easy to fix.  
---
The levelling experience is for the most part substantially improved compared with classic, and the game is overall very atmospheric, far more so than the expansions from cata  going forward.
---
I agree regarding those abusing it. Kind of sucks for people like me that were not keeping my toon logged in for rediculous periods of time, like to give a child a bath for example...
---
Who are the tryhard losers that downvoted this new player for asking a question?
---
Happened to me last night. My gf was playing around with my character for a bit. Literally afk about 15 min to eat and shower and got booted.

🤣

"Would you like this flight path to end at the next stop available?  Just click this button that never existed in Vanilla."

i'm tanking as a hunter and still topping the dps, i've got a fuckin plan
---
 &gt; DPS Warrior
---
 &gt; Not carrying a sword+shield for dungos
---
 &gt; Not just default tanking dungeons anyway
---
 &gt; not paying attention to the healers mana
---
yup. Definitely a Classic tank.
---
Yeah, was about to say..."T0 helm and arc reaper, while raiding AQ40? wat"
---
With the help of layering abuse, yes. Twice have randoms already asked me to invite them to my layer.
---
The first 60 of classic even streamed himself doing it. Neither private servers nor original vanilla had this.
---
yes, and I'm sure someone will post thr link.
---
I dont remember it or I would do it now. Lol
---
Free karma and validation.
---
The worst part in my opinion is that a narcissistic fraud like Tipsout has been able to get to stream for Method.
---
He deserves to be sent to one of his father construction yards in Saudi Arabia and work in the summer ourside.
---
Pathetic parassite.
---
They essentially said they would. Probably just before phase 2 I bet. When they want to get rid of the layering and there are servers with too many players, they will make free transfers. Or they will make it directly after getting rid of phasing. Like "You sit in a queue for 6 hours now. But how about "A FREE SERVER TRANSFER \*holy noises\*"
---
Leatrix has a mode that actually speeds up auto loot time a ton
---
Yeah it’s pretty casual
---
You dont rly need to cc. Just pull tons and aoe it down. It the warrior isnt potatoe he will kite the pack until mage pulls aggro.
---
Clicker and didn't use racial?

He didn't stand a chance

Sure,  I will send you PM tomorrow with my FB if u want.

I honestly don't think a lot of the item combinations you see is how adventurers in a somewhat serious scenario would look like, especially when it comes to set items.

I get this too! Happens mostly when I hold both m1 and 2 for running. It gets super speedy and moving it a millimeter makes the camera spin like hell. After I let it go for a second or two it resets. I have no addons at all and not installed any previously either.

But only away from full realms.

Oh, my bad I'm retarded (:
---
Let’s say you’re doing a boss fight. Boss at 50% health, tank and dps on 100%. You have ~60% mana and are pretty positive nothing crazy is gonna happen, you won’t heal the lock so he can dps a little longer? Even though you’ll probably end the fight with 40/50% mana? I’m genuinely curious, not trying to pick apart your play style.
---
I started queuing about 4 hrs ago with 6.5k queue and I just got in. Interestingly enough I got kicked out of the queue about 10min ago and I freaked out, luckily my spot in queue was still saved!
---
It’s crazy how 4 measly gigabytes captured an entire generation of online gamers 15 years ago
---
What mouse is this?
---
Priest vs Paladin, a well time fear to interrupt his heal finished the job!
---
Heres what I do:
---
1. Use immolate macro to cast and order per attack on mob 1.
---
2. Finish casting corruption and curse of shadow or whatever it's called that has back end DMg. 
---
3. Aggro mob 2 with petbound immolate again, finish casting all dots again.
---
4. Wand mob 1 to death.
---
5. If at any time you feel threatened by additional mobs cast your corruption + curse of agony (remembered the name) on the mobs you HAVE NOT cast immolate on, then fear them. If you are sufficiently scared just immediately cast fear. As long as you dont him them they're going to be gone for awhile, and there's no cc duration reduction in vanilla (except slows *laughs in frostshock*) so you can infinitely repeat this in order to survive. 
---
Generally you never want to use shadowbolt early on because the beginner wands have such insanely high dps they out dps your shadowbolt until like rank 4 or even 5 depending on the mobs resistances. Make sure you have a hearthstone ready if you really need it, but I find I dont often need them and use them as mini instant heals to keep the farm train going.
---
Twink?
---
He's playing Classic the way he wants. He played Vanilla the way he wanted years ago. We're all different people than we were in 2004-2006. We brought the game back in time, we can't bring that time back to us. 
---
Nothing wrong with what he's doing. I play my way (level 21 slow leveler) and he can play his way. No gatekeeping.
---
Thanks for a logical reply, this is exactly what I've been saying, but it's hard to beat a groupthink mentality and nostalgia, especially when combined(goes for both sides). I just write out "Deadmines" when looking for a group to prevent either side from starting another hour-long argument. 
---
It's just annoying to see comments like "If I see someone say VC they're auto-ignored" or vice versa for DM. Grow the fuck up people.
---
Tfw you are braindead enough to think pure damage is all that matters and on top of that you think you have to min max raid build in anything before AQ 40.
---
"Please don't power word shield me, it messes with my rage generation"
---
"Ok"
---
&lt;keeps power word shielding me&gt;
---
Eventually somebody will probably chew them out and they'll learn
---
Obscure maybe, definitely not an underdog.  Anyone who played private servers knew these guys because they were a very disruptive force on any new private server launch.
---
Most of the current Classic playerbase just didn't know them because they weren't in the private server scene.
---
Booted to log in screen and had to sit in the queue again for 5 hours if I wanted to play

People watch sports for other reasons than just seeing the best of the best being the best at their sports. If that were the case, there wouldn't be anyone watching lower leagues, but there are.

Wowinterface has a couple of the quickfix versions of retail addons, but all in all, I’d just recommend the Twitch client for ease of use. Searching and installing mods right from the client itself.

The question was never what VC stands for. We know what that means. The question is what DM stands for.

Imagine caring this much about some guy who plays games on the internet. As someone back playing WoW and learning about people like Asmon it amazes me how obsessed people are with him. Get help.

Had some serious Girlfriend aggro today, this meme might be me by the end of the day...
---
Supply is the issue. 
---
Historically gold sellers get the gold by two means, grinds and stealing accounts.
---
With modern security and authenticators I would imagine its bit harder for them to get into account. 
---
The next is grinds. Yes, streamers and Vets are high level but the majority of the player base isnt at a level to be able to easily grind large valves. Once they have high level characters you'll find this will drop. The same goes for stolen accounts, these will have more gold per account. Currently were still mostly poor.
---
Well said mate. I finally had the time to play today and I have been in 4 or 5 groups in like 2 hours and made some friends from every group. A few kontgs back I hoped into retail on a starter sub and I honestly couldnt group up or even find a reason to. Now I'm stuck at a family get together and can't wait to hop back on and grind with the new homies and run into some more random groups.
---
Still not sure what your argument is for how the game released with 3 Oceanic PvP servers. When the game first became playable (I.E released) there was only Arugal.
---
I had a DD warrior (!) that wanted to tell me he is just getting aggro because he does so much damage. That he often hit targets before I hit them once didn't matter to him. He also often - for some reason - attacked sheeped targets. I think he tried to generate more rage by getting hit so he can do more damage.
---
Well, he didn't do that for long because the healer just let him die early on.
---
Games out less than a week and we’re already onto cosplay attention whoring
---
That's fine. I'll never play retail and if classic dies in a few months I'll probably have played through everything by then and I'll just never play WoW again.
---
Yeah until a big portion get bored, then try bfa because of already having a subscription and sticking to the more improved game that is retail.
---
Just curious is all. I could type a paragraph about what you did “wrong” but I fear it’ll come off as me being a dick when I’m just trying to help lol
---
That what I told my friends... and I told them don’t go on streamer servers

I found out that asking for one sunder is enough to ask with hunters.

I started this weekend with a hunter, then went warlock, then druid, then back to warlock again. I keep thinking about Pally or priest but I don't like healing. I'm driving myself up the wall a bit by not making up my mind. I just want to have fun questing and doing the occasional dungeon with perhaps a bit of RP. I'm going to end up with hunter most likely...
---
Glad to hear you  have your mind made up!
---
other way around for me i have more time in my adult life vs school  life, i had a job and went to high school so only had time at late night weekends.
---
Now i only work full time and have plenty of time to play this game but i also don't have kids.
---
So where can I see what phase 3,4 etc is and when it’ll be released?
---
How do you have bag space to do this...
---
&gt;Oh I forgot the two warriors charging in on the mob I’m LOS pulling away so we don’t get overrun.
---
My very first pull in my first DM since returning and a Warrior DPS did this on the first pull and wiped us.
---
I've had the same experience in the human zones. I guess everyone's mileage may vary
---
Has AsmonGold never said "Can I get that" or thought he didn't deserve/kick people if he didn't get everything he asked for?
---
Did you actually think someone was going to change who they are because of a reset on a game?
---
is the STV fishing tourny not happening today?
---
We have an amazing mmo, retail. Classic is good for what it is, a faithful recreation of vanilla as it was. Leave new content to retail
---
Voting has lead to issues with OSRS imo. But in general, they have done a great job. Obviously a lot of parallels between classic and OSRS, important to remember that OSRS was dying (after very hyped release) before they started making changes.
---
Rockbiter with a slow 2h is the way to go until windfury, hits like a truck!
---
Or dagger with flametongue, paired with a shield and you're a bit tankier
---
Bc killed azeroth. Everyone just hanging out in shattrah.. Meh.
---
It is literally the title of this post.
---
Just like Mythic Raiding on retail. Loving Both. I'm really hyped for the next expansion, I hope they figure out how to get the best of both worlds.
---
“You couldn’t live with the expansions, and where did that bring you?  Back to me” 
---
-Wow Classic, probably
---
There were always easy resources and friendly people.
---
Dunno what your malfunction was but glad you got over it.
---
Did you get this to work? Im currently having the same problem, my chatbar wont even let me type /Luna menu
---
Storm wind.
---
Right, I understand the concept, but I thought SM was a max of 5 people...?
---
Hey man, I know nobody is responding to you but honestly it sounds like WoWC just isn't for you then.
---
It was made mostly for nostalgia folks and people who are new to the whole mainstream MMO scene. If you're not having fun or finding cool people to play with maybe try something else.
---
That or take a break for a week and find another dungeon focused guild.
---
Also, it sounds like you focused on leveling up too fast because the average level of the playerbase is about 21-28 right now so it's no real surprise you're facerolling stuff, there is no competition and only folks who know what they're doing with leveling in mind are at your level.
---
Who cares how Asmon plays Classic? He's playing it and that's all that matters. There's nothing he's doing that is unvanilla-like. 
---
I don't care much for him, but jeez man you're really whining over the way SOMEONE ELSE plays the game when you don't even have to watch this person.... Get a clue and realize that no one gives a shit that you're butt hurt.
---
Asmon was an advocate for Classic and used his platform to help our cause, why should he play the game to your ideals? Just play the damn game and quit crying.
---
Well, just wait till you reach ~55.
---
Paladin's can generate threat faster than warriors at this level tbh. They don't have to build rage.
---
They could just do a full reboot and take the game in a whole different direction using stuff that had to be scrapped for continuity purposes.
---
Ragefire Chasm in german is Flammenschlund tho. I used to play on german servers and never saw RFC being called RFA.
---
Ohh, this occasion didn't happen yet in my place. The dungeons I was in, bosses fall relatively fast and the locks always disassembled themselves between trashmobs.
---
In the harder bossfights until now, I didn't heal DD's at all, aside from maybe tossing them some first aid. All my mana was reserved for the tank. In one for example, the lock died. But we managed the bossfight with only a dead lock on me on zero mana and a used potion. 
---
My mana is more important than a locks mana. If they go oom so fast during a bossfight, then they should stop using shadowbolts and/or take some potions. Well or, learn first aid and bandage themselves up. This is what DD's do, it is a requirement for them to take care of their own healing for the majority of bossfights in classic.
---
That's because WoW Classic is not technically a 15 year old game. It was created from scratch on modern system architecture and made to be recreated as faithfully to the original Vanilla game as possible. You can see they talked about it [in this dev watercooler](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic): 
---
&gt;"While our initial effort helped us determine the experience we wanted to provide, this second prototype really defined how we’d get there. Starting from a modern architecture—with all its security and stability changes—means the team’s efforts can be focused on pursuing an authentic classic experience. Any differences in behavior between our development builds and the patch 1.12 reference can be systematically cataloged and corrected, while still operating from a foundation that’s stable and secure."   
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt;"All the work we’re doing will ultimately allow us to recreate an authentic classic experience on a platform that is much more optimized and stable, helping us avoid latency and stability issues. Additional improvements will include modern anti-cheat/botting detection, customer service and Battle.net integration, and similar conveniences that do not affect the core gameplay experience."
---
I went to smolderfist and best decision made. I don’t like the idea of waiting to play when I already have to pay. Was on bigglesworth and had a 3 hour queue first day.
---
Also yes or maybe no, there’s plenty of games to choose from.
---
2 is also fully true. Just look at 2007scape.
---
Nope, but it is a hunter weapon.
---
Right now the market price for most components and crafted items is barely higher than vendor price. And by "barely" I mean it sometimes goes lower, you can make a few silvers by buying stuff on the AH / trade channel and selling it to npcs.
---
When you consider the AH cut or the time it takes to sell stuff in trade chat, selling to vendors is pretty much always more profitable than to players. The other good alternative is stocking it for later.

---
Things like this bring tears to my eyes. It is wonderful to feel like everyone is coming home again after 15 years.  
---
Wonderfully done, OP!
---
I made an extra bag for a warrior that helped me out for a while in Westfall, the thank you note he sent back was heartwarming af. :3
---
get between the pet and the party, and feign death.
---
I've had to do this more times than I like to admit.  Embarassing but better than a wipe.
---
Thank you I’m gonna try now :)
---
Inventory is full
---
Anecdotal but my friends and I (all in our late 20’s with careers) will be playing consistently. The grind and causal atmosphere compared to games like LoL and CSGO is ideal for working professionals imo. Easy to jump on for an hour here and there.
---
How ironic
---
The circular discussion is pointless. There’s plenty enough people who piss their pants over minmaxing, and plenty of people who don’t care that much for everyone to get into a group. It’s classic WoW. Both groups will still clear the raids just fine.
---
Yeah people advocating for it is not why it got released.
---
Shaman Tanks [RISE UP!!!](https://discord.gg/x6paERN)
---
The fishing extravaganza was introduced in 1.7.0 with ZG, so I assume it is not a part of phase 1. Someone feel free to correct me if I am wrong.
---
I am in a similar situation. My friends and I picked faerlina before the streamers decided they were playing there. 2 of us said fuck that and rolled on a different server, but the other two are powering through on that server still. One plays at odd times to avoid queues, and the other is the one that changes his entire sleep schedule and personal life just to play on that server. Both of them playing alone even. I just don't get it.
---
My hope is they butterfly effect the game.
---
We went back in time, can change certain event and branch off in a different future.....
---
....All without changing the cap and making the mistakes if future expansions. New events, new content, new stronger gear, but same perfect classes
---
Of course! I’ve been referring to it for my Druid, having never played one until WOTLK. It’s been very helpful, it even guides you to any class relevant quests you may need.
---
Not sure if trolling or....
---
I don't think it's just streamers - it probably started out as such but world chat is now chock-full of people spamming for AOE/cleave dungeon farm groups.
---
Yeah ESO has over a million active players but I don't think I ever heard it pitched that way by people.
---
Not sure about the default UI but Bartender can do it
---
well I wasn't ready I thought it was party invite. didn't use my race ability or the health potions and wasted good items on useless PVP. and when I went back to the city I realzied  I didn't upgrade my spells which were ready to upgrade at 6. but op items helped me. anything to add?
---
Stay classy buddy. Enjoy the game ;)
---
Bltch
---
They failed and now they turn their words..
---
Is that why Classic is/was riddled with bugs? Gotcha. Try again, sir.
---
They shouldn't ES or use rockbiter weapon unless they are TRYING to tank. I successfully tanked many low-level dungeons as enhancement shaman, but I would only recommend it to people that really know what they are doing.
---
thanks &lt;3
---
He will be back, they ALWAYS come back.. especially when his friends and guildies are nolifing in classic like the good ol days.
---
I actually watched a little longer, thinking that his attitude might be a persona. Why else would so many people watch his streams.
---
Alas no, he actually is an asshole
---
For a sub that hates streamers so much you sure do talk about them a lot
---
Done 3 runs total in WC, had to point this out to a shaman each run. Their reaction was priceless ;D
---
Rogues should be combat when leveling plus improved sap is only 90% at best. You just don't use sap as a pve CC in vanilla unless you absolutely need it.
---
&gt; It should be fixed as soon as possible, to prevent any further exploitation of the bug.
---
I disagree, it should be acknowledged and basically be embraced as a feature at this point BECAUSE Blizzard doesn't have the balls to rollback days of people grinding and abusing it to level.
---
Heck i only PLAYED Vanilla, I didn't work on it yet I was certain that being in a raid to run dungeons was a horrible idea because it destroyed xp gains despite making it way easier it was never ever ever ever done because xp was the most important thing.
---
So when i started briefly watching clips about people leveling ... i really honestly after seeing raid frames in those clips assumed it was 5 people + a few pets ...then that turned into hearing about how running dungeons as raids is the goal i believed "we'll maybe reduced xp while being in raid was the bug in vanilla and they fixed it for classic ?"
---
Hence after reading your post, i'm torn... on one hand i'm glad that i wasn't crazy yet also disappointed in Blizzard because they dropped the ball on something they should had caught.
---
Yep, I've had mostly good runs but I have a few dps I never want to run with again already.
---
Corpsemaker is better even at lvl 29
---
retail vs private server raiders
---
it's a different game, those who know the old game better, will be better at it
---
I started playing vanilla a few months after launch. On my server it was always abbreviated DM or just plainly written as Deadmines.
---
But why? Whats the difference? As a non wow player wow feels just like the other mmos obviously with its own combat system and stuff
---
15 years ago that game came out, don't forget that... it was great and its nice to be back there... for me up until Wrath of the Lich King, WoW was the best... after that I just got expansions to see the lore. Enjoying Classic now 😉
---
Played boulderfist in vanilla and even the horde called it VC
---
I only had one horde out of 8 or so groups of horde ignore me near the BFD entrance.
---
As a first time player who never had the chance to experience it way back when this has been my experience too. Everyone has been so helpful and the advice on reddit has helped me so much. Thank you all
---
THIS.
---
ALL OF THIS.
---
I’m new to wow and what is these addons? The tab on top and the chat ones specifically?
---
One common trick is to rebind A and D to strafe left/right instead of turn. Not only is keyboard turning a bad habit, but it frees up Q and E to bind spells to. I also bind Shift+(key) to a lot of my longer/less common casts to avoid clicking and still have them conveniently placed, for instance "e" = (spell) "shift+e" = different spell
---
This is why I stopped playing all these other games. I don't know why it is so hard to not make the game choppy. But Aion, etc. all play extremely choppy. I believe because WoW shows you the reaction clientside whereas other games show it server side. So the small lag you have on a game, you see in other games because your character only performs stuff slightly after the input, whereas WoW shows it you instantly, even if the server registers it later.
---
It also has to do with the animations though. WoW animations are not much movement, so there is not much to chop around. When I play other games, my characters move everywhere while casting, resulting in choppy animations by going from cast to cast.
---
Raids need paladins, but they will most likely try to get you to heal unless they are a chill group. Good luck :D
---
Source?
---
Thanks, got it!
---
&gt; and thought my memory was terrible
---
Yeah I was also sitting here watching 10-man SM runs thinking "wait wtf, why did 13 year-old me never do this, even with 6 or 7 people? There were so many times we had extra DPS, did we not once think to try this?"
---
How do you kite the pack without getting any threat on all the mobs? The mage should pull aggro right away by this plan
---
Classic WoW is mostly, in my opinion, for people who played classic or at least BC. It's a nostalgia thing, it is different from retail but still has a similar feel. I'm playing it because I enjoy the slower pace and for the nostalgia and remembering how thing where when I was around 13 years old. 
---
If you've never played classic/BC/WotLK, I can completely understand how it can feel underwhelming. Especially if you start comparing it to other MMOs. Don't forget the game is 15years old.
---
You don’t it’s trial and error
---
Yeah right someone that enjoys classic for 60 levels wont enjoy bfa most likely
---
Warrior tank as its one of the roles you cant do or Hunter as its a none caster ranged dps.
---
If anything the numbers were tuned higher on pservers. Its easy as fuck for them on classic ones.
---
Asmongold doesn't need to align himself with any type of game play philosophy or strict self-regulated rules he puts on himself. He already won; by making $100,000+ a month from terrible companies (amazon) and raking in massive social clout on the biggest streaming services. Asmongold won classic
---
Hey bro. MC and Ony Week one btw.
---
Why not just "classic" servers to retail? Remove dailies, dungeon finders, but keep new spells and abilities. Take away the creature comforts of what retail has become and let the raw experience shine through.
---
LFG/LFM anyone?
---
Apart from mage AOE grinding (which we all know can make a ton of money at 60), what are other classes that have their own methods of making a lot of gold?
---
Very pleased :)
---
Keep your small eggs for winters veil and prepare to be rich!
---
&gt;We thought more highly of you. 
---
No we didn't, we knew he wouldn't keep his promise. He is ruining his *fulfillment* in classic (you know, that thing he's been complaining is missing from retail.) When he hits 60 it won't be *his* accomplishment, it's not the same as buying a levelboost but it's the same idea.
---
You can get out and back in. It saves your place
---
No focus. Not sure I think some add ons do it though
---
I’m pretty sure people did this in vanilla as well. They just want an authentic wow experience dude, why you you have to be mad? It only game
---
Ive played a bit on a large wotlk server prior to classic relase. I  love this blizzlike mechanic that lets me use a proc twice with quick timing. Feels just like progressing on mythic end bosses.
---
LMAO!
---
Rick and Morty copypasta
---
Right click the chat box. Background. There should be a slider on the right.
---
Normies... you realize how much time Method puts into this game right? They flew to Las Vegas to compete in the world first race... that’s a sponsored version of a basement dweller.
---
Can I gift the free game and level boost to somebody else
---
Cause I'm not gonna touch it
---
That’s my character’s name too!!
---
Tauren druids
---
Ok, but do any of them have max fishing?
---
Wasn't in early vanilla.  I think they added it later in vanilla.  Early vanilla had timed respawns based on how long ago the mob died.  Of course its been a while so I could be wrong.
---
its a way to look at it
---
Why didn't I just play on Gandling or Razorgore, why did I have to roll on Mograine because it had a cool name?...
---
Much easier to level with Arms and you're still the slowest class in the game. But you can still do it if you want to.
---
You should really read my first couple of comments again once you've calmed down. 
---
Then you'll see that you started a fight out nothing.
---

---
Fury is good, just not for leveling.
---
Even horde on my realm called deadmines VC, we would run twinks through for gear
---
They appeal to different people. I'm enjoying Classic a lot more than BfA but there are a LOT of people who still love retail. Classic and retail are wildly different games at this point and Classic being better to a lot of people won't "kill" it for others. I'll be very surprised if Classic's playerbase ever matches retail's.
---
Thanks for the explanation. This was really helpful to me.
---
Sco founded Method in 2005
---
Um, not sure if that's the same thing.  I could be wrong though. But /focus sets a particular target window up at all times even if you're targeting another enemy.
---
For example, set my /focus to the target I want to sheep. Then I DPS main enemy, but I can keep an eye on my eye and resheep when needed.
---
Players are a huge part of the game but they are on top of the content that is already there. People won't stick around talking in trade chat if there is nothing left in the game to do. You can only level so many alts before things get stale even with a great community. The hardcore people who have been playing private servers for years will stick around but I can't imagine the vast majority of players will play for more than a year or two without any new content.
---
What always gets me...no one runs “dire maul”
---
You do DME
---
You do DMW
---
You do DMN
---
You do jump runs
---
You do tribute runs

I have never seen someone just say “let’s do dire mail”

I’ve just recently found GamePedia has a really nice macro guide along with API/syntax 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Making_a_macro
---
And the graphics just feel weird. It doesn't feel as natural.
---
Yep. Its very funny to watch people minmax 0 mechanic raids that can be finished easily without the extra 1k dps forced into the comp.
---
Get the fuck out with this ‘WRONG FUN!!’ bullshit attitude
---
Please, just take my upvote.
---
I've never played retail mate so I'd have to look into that. Probably a huge time sink lol!
---
So WoD and BfA right off the bat so we're left with the good expansions later on? That's a good idea!
---
You don’t have to start up retail at all think of it as getting a sock for christmas the gift is meh but they’re trying just never wear the sock.
---
All his names were taken :(
---
Most popular OSRS streamers play HC or on a normal ironman account. They can't trade and have to do everything themselves, except group content. Even then they can't get monetary help nor can they get gear from others.
---
Do you have a macro that works for downranking spells? I’ve looked online and can’t get any to work for my frostbolt
---
Casuals wont one shot AQ or naxx, or probably even BWL
---
Stop fucking thinking MC is all vanialla has to offer, its a fucking starter casual raid, no shit till be one shot.
---
But look at the MC event from retail, you could barely do it.. GL pugging it vanilla
---
Oh okay, thank you, I'll try find some. 
---
I wonder if I use /focus in a macro, it will work?  I guess I need to do some testing.
---
Surprised this is a thing you can do
---
Warrior. You can only melee. You can't dps. You have no options. You auto-attack. You get out of this at higher levels, so if you want something that plays itself, roll paladin. Paladins can heal themselves, so they're betetr than warriors !
---
Wow, this takes me back to a similar glitch around the Burning Crusade era. You could walk the whole way to stranglethorn under the map, had about 20+ people exploring down there together.
---
People can decide how they want to play a game whoever they are. Just like anything else, If it does not directly affect you then this shouldn't matter to you. You can be disappointed if you want but he hasn't failed a game that many people enjoy.
---
*Equip legendary cloak, McCocknel.*
---
Some dude posted there 12 month year old owning it on the drums.
---
This isnt any good.
---
 Blizzard should add new content to Classic Wow that did not make the first game.   I'm sure they have stuff.
---
Well why do so many people watch Keeping up with the Kardashians? It is objectively terrible quality television.
---
It's mostly for people who just wanna get to 60 asap and don't wanna put in too much effort into it. I feel like they are losing out on the main game so I am not too worried.
---
I guess commenting sternly towards you for propagating stupid comments is what qualifies as angry now. Im not mad at you, I just think you are an idiot. Theres a difference.
---
Give me a girlfriend, and Im all yours
---
That’s so weird. 
---
I’ve had the opposite experience and I’m rolling on Faerlina, a PvP server that also seems to host a huge majority of the streamers. 
---
I was so worried the community was going to be full of toxic fanboys but it’s been the opposite. 
---
I’ve found questing groups dozens of times in the last week, and everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful.
---
I wish I got the screenshot, but I was in a group yesterday where we got a 100 roll, and a 1 roll at the same time for a greed roll.
---
Compare the prices using Addons that show vendor pricing. AH in your territories take 5% of your sale, 15% if youre in a neutral AH.
---
True, hunters are fine as well. I just listed the cookie-cutter raiders choice.
---
Exactly. Retail has too many "hooks" that try to make you keep playing. Daily quests, emissaries, dungeon and raid resets, there's too much.
---
Classic feels like an honest game again. You just play when and how much you want.
---
I think they just changed the AFK system and many are getting disconnected way sooner than usual.
---
Yes. It would be doable for people that already got endgame in retail.
---
“We thought more highly of you”
---
For the life of me I can’t imagine why
---
Oh snap! Thanks, didn’t even realize it was my cake day today so thanks for saying something
---
Is there an addon that would show how much I heal a target ? I can only see how much I heal myself
---
I mean everyone plays classic the way they want... thats why classic is good. Nobody jumps on joker for AoE grinding to reach 60, yet everyone jumps on this redneck for playing the way he wants
---
Tailoring because you get cloth from mobs, if you don’t have skinning leather working will be expensive
---
Old-school RuneScape. It went in a totally new direction with a new policy of keeping the "old-school" feel. It has worked very well so far.
---
You are the most annoying type of person on Reddit.
---
I'll have to look, it was a couple years ago.. basically a victoria sponge cake with a fondant spiral and and blue glitter to show the magic xD
---
If I pick another profession (already have 2) would I have to re-level the profession I'm dropping if I switch back?
---
Is that Broke Back Mountaineers in Skeram?
---
Currently raid xp is bugged, they are recieving xp as though they are in 5 mans and with 10 people they are cruising through at-level dungeons. Not the most fun way to see the world but one way to level fast i suppose.
---
Then they fit in with this subreddit.
---
Yooooo thanks for sharing,  was having this annoying issue myself!
---
You're angry that some people dont want to play with meme specs and you're taking that anger out on a person who is literally saying "go for it" if you want to play a meme spec.
---
They don’t know any better, that’s what they’ve been trained to do since LFR
---
Do me a favor? Give your wife a big hug and tell her as a fellow healer, I'm rooting for her. Healing is stressful, but can be fun as hell and very rewarding.
---
-Torachi, Pagle
---
Nah sorry, we waited way too long for Classic for this kind of nonsense man.
---
Continuing to do servers of later expansions doesn't solve anything though. It just results in the same issue of stagnant content with a bunch of dead servers. They need to just do Classic+ and not bother with giving everyone the expansion they want as a seperate server.
---
Get 5/5 wand spec then work your way down shadow starting with 5/5 spirit tap. Stack as much spirit as you can find and buy less magic wand and greater magic wand off AH. Cast all your spells up front then wand last 50% of mob hp.  
---
Follow a questing addon and do all the yellow quests you can find.  
---
That's literally all you need to know to get to 60 find as a priest.
---
What kind of endgame will Classic have? Will there be progression like on retail? A new raid tier every few months? 
---
Also are all raids 40 man raids?
---
Well, yeah.
---
This is how asmongold acts on retail. I don't know why you'd expect any different.
---
Every play session I've had at least one group of randoms from out in the world because unlike BFA, you can't solo all of the quests. Nobody groups in Retail because there's zero incentive to. Killing mobs is trivial so by extension, the rest of the game feels meaningless as a result.
---
Literally me today!
---
Better gear, learn new spells - that’ll do it.
---
If you plan on raiding or joining a guild that uses voice chat a lot, you may start getting called, “Men” for short. And that will be how you are known in the world now.
---
Wrong, ESO has more active players. Not really fair to compare the two though because ESO is also on XBox and Playstation.
---
Am Tauren Druid, can confirm.
---
I dont really care honestly. I played until maybe 6 months after TBC released and stopped. With healthy server populations, it's fun to go back to vanilla wow. Keeping it simple, enjoying the grind again and looking forward to running some of the dungeons and raids at end-game. I'll probably play for a minimum of 3 months and at that subscription rate it's still cheaper than buying a new $60 game.
---
dude who gives a fuck
---
Ahhh the Defias Mask. I remember scoring one on my first ever character. I was elated. I didnt want to swap it to the horrible looking leather skullcap green I eventually found. Good times.
---
will I get kicked if I show up as a Shaman to tank?
---
I know they can't be tanks in retail, but they're pretty hefty in classic, and have a threat generating totem.
---
Yes, no and no
---
I don't know if I want to become a hardcore raider yet. I wanted to go shaman because I like the idea of enhancement. I also want to try healing for once. I never healed during Retail.
---
Honestly it depends on what way you look at it. For me for example, all that movement stuff never really was hard. With DBM you just do what the addon tells you. I also never raided classic. It could be that the gear needed is quite insane and similar. So it depends on what you look at to call a raid hard. Is it the logistics or the execution. 
---
I would say classic has harder logistics while retail has way harder execution. My main gripe is, for me, an endgame that consists solely out of raiding is a somewhat shallow endgame, and classic was a lot more than just raiding. Even if for many, these other parts of classic may be something they don't like, which is something I can understand. 
---
I've seen some pretty cool raids and they were awesome. But for me they were made shit by using DBM, but I have yet to see a guild that raids without DBM and I feel like retail by now is essentially affixed on the point that everyone will use DBM.
---
imagine being as pathetic as OP. 75% of u guys are in your 30's just dont watch him lmao
---
McCocknel
---
LOL entitled much?! Never read so much nonsense. Look people can play however they want, the only experience that matters is your own. Who gives a shit if players ask for gold and spam dungeons. Guess what? People did that back in day also. 
---
He hasn't failed anyone, hes not beholden to your opinion on anything, never mind how to play wow. Utter nonsense
---
lol he's reading this on stream now
---
I have been trying to find a working extended quest log addon. Can you send me to where you found this ?
---
I didn't know who asmongold was for a while. I always thought he was just another logan/jake paul personality: super popular, but annoying... like ninja. I don't see the appeal in watching twitch streamers. Like, if you jave nothing better to do, sure, but to watch them play a game instead of playing it yourself? Why?
---
I see why people avoided the streamer servers like the plague. It would be so annoying getting swarmed by fanboys while you are just trying to level...
---
I'm not sure of that actually.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/984mzm/bug_your_mouse_is_fine_camera_angle_changing_bug/
---
Here in the comments they explain how to change your config.txt file. You could try that
---
Yeah this is true.
---
Didn't know I have to quit Classic because a streamer got an item or played efficiently. My bad guys, I'll uninstall real quick...
---
So basically, the main thing which makes me want to play Lock (pets), isn't that relevant in dungeons, and Rouges do use DoTs?
---
Priest seems to look really good right now, haha.
---
Try to reset the quest
---
Cool thanks will do.
---
[laughs in warlock]
---
There is no "How not to play classic" ppl can play it however they want, what u define fun might not be fun for someone else.
---
You’re welcome for the ban. Try being less of an idiot next time around.
---
Learn to screenshot
---
That is why you don't run on Faerlina. Scarab Lord Might of Menethil Asmongold already secured, the god of the server.
---
Let's not insult retail and service industry people.
---
Get a lesser magic wand if you are under 13 and get a greater magic wand if you are above 13. Go to BFD at 21-23 and get the wand from the dungeon quest.
---
Your rotation:
---
Shield
---
Mind Blast
---
DoT
---
Wand
---
Repeat
---
If you dislike him so much, just don't watch him? It's not like it's affecting your gameplay and your classic experience. Just enjoy the game the way you enjoy it and let him enjoy it the way he does.
---
It's not too bad tanking. Everyone I've been in a group with have been real cool and all my runs go smooth. Plus as a tank for the most part you get to dictate the pace. You have that power.
---
So can you give some examples of retail players hating classic players? Like actual examples of projected hate toward the player base and not simply criticism of classic or calling out the discrepancies between what was gospelled and reality?
---
It's important that this bug is addressed and hotfixed as fast as possible. Just saddens my heart to see tons of people exploiting a Classic-only bug that never belonged to vanilla - especially a bunch of most popular streamers doing it. The exploitation of non-vanilla bugs (layering, raid xp) ruin the game's idea for me. 
---
You can help by reaching out the classic devs or sharing the word. I had to do this post when I noticed a majority of people believed 1) the bug doesn't exist, or 2) it's a vanilla thing, while it really isn't.
---
This is 100% me. It's why I always buff random mages and druids, lol
---
Yep I got wrecked.
---
Asmon failed because he is playing Clasic the exact same way he plays BFA, despite always whining about BFA sucking. Its the same gameplay and same experience for him and on his stream. Nothing new. Its a contradiction between how he was and what he is now doing.
---
Don’t think it’s bugged. 10 Manning was allowed back in the day, and Blizzard announced it would be an allowed thing. 
---
I agree though, it’s so boring. I could see maybe doing it on alts to level them faster and for some folks that just want max level without caring about the process.   I also see why streamers do it when even just mundane questing can be impossible on a PvP server, but overall, it seems awful.
---
You are at 100% Mana before every pull?
---
Yeah bro that’s when you use a lower rank and replace that shit.
---
Tailoring is paired with it when done on one character because you can't have skinning, leather and enchantment.
---
But if you're talking about alts feeding your enchanter leather is much easier to get than cloth because so many people just leave carcasses around of anyone to skin.
---
Half of these points are ridicilous, if a item drops you need and you ask "can i have that" its about 90% of the people who play the game, i can see some of the points you get to, but he is a streamer, he's got stuff to do, and all other streamers are going to do it, get over youself, he plays the game the way he wants to, who the fuck are you to tell him how to play the game? if anyone have failed clasic, its you for expecting how others are suposed to play clasic, clasic is meant to be played the way you want and enjoyed the way you want. If he nejoys the way he is playing, who the hell are you to tell him he's doing it wrong? You ser, need to get your own head out of your VERY tight arse.
---
Can you make a macro to set mark ?  Does that work ?
---
Get off your digital high horse lmao
---
Nah. I remember in vanilla, after leveling up without addons, I got one that literally showed you exactly where to go on the map. I'm hoping for something a little less than that because I still want it to be an effort, I just want to know if I'm wasting my time because I'm too low or something.
---
Thanks for the suggestions, I'll look into those.
---
That whole text box is a gold mine , lol got em!
---
I could be wrong, it's been quite awhile since vanilla, but I think that only applies on PvP servers. On PvE I think you can have both factions on a server..
---
I was thinking about trying one lately. Originally I was worried I wouldnt know how to properly RP but then I was reading people are super helpful and won't mind if you suck at it. The real dread is starting a new character (have a 19 and 16 mage). But also I'm a community oriented guy so this looks like a good option. Guess I'll check it out!
---
No shit Sherlock
---
RP and PVP are endless fonts of content. Consider how Counterstrike is still going with negligible content updates, and primarily only changes in visual fidelity.
---
I don't know know how many people will stay. But I suspect that classic will have a very persistent core community, and the content that they make for one another is going to keep them entertained far past the actual playtime of all the ingame content.
---
5 times
---
I wouldn’t delete the character.
---
Right now I’m leveling a hunter I used to main holy paladin but the simplicity of healing would have driven me up a wall.
---
High quality shit post here boys. Jebaited
---
Because if the last talent in the tree is the strongest, then you NEED to get that talent, and now you are forced to that tree.
---
If the strongest talent is near the middle of the tree, then you can be "full" spec or a hybrid between specs.
---
Currently dealing with this issue as well. 
---
It really is driving me completely insane and im hoping Blizzard is working to reduce queue times some more. Its currently unbearable.
---
You're defending meme specs. 
---
I'm literally saying people should do it if they insist.
---
Yet you're picking a fight with me over it. 
---
And you're calling me an idiot for that. 
---
Top notch.
---
How could you have expected anything else from him? Just from seeing clips of his stream on YouTube it was pretty obvious that he was always going to be that guy.
---
He’s just a cancer when it comes to the spirit of classic.
---
As long as you have a windfury totem, I feel like you'll have a place. Lol. You should be fine.

This please. Nearly every thread there's something about retail vs classic.
---
Nice! Glad to hear it. Guess I just rolled bad on server choice. I'll have to branch out and see how other communities are before getting into serious leveling.
---
McConnell is the only wow streamer worth watching
---
Ret Paladin. That is all
---
And it shouldn’t be.
---
It happened and I have nothing to prove.
---
Hero
---
Yes but unfortunately thats where his positive contribution to the community has really ended.
---
His "playstyle" and social etiquette are not deserving of a classic wow figurehead.
---
Who cares about asmongold lmao
---
It makes sense. In general, the more somebody does something, the less fun it is and the more it feels like work and the less they are open to enhancing their experience with socializing
---
eat my ass skinny boy
---
I have never ever seen people do this on pservers and usually those are full of min maxers. Is it really that fast leveling? Or is it just the retail effect and people who only know how to farm dungeons to level?
---
You are retarded holy fuck take a long long walk plz
---
I'm on razorgore.
---
Depends how you go about it. If you spend some time gearing up your BFA character and then get into mythic keystone sales or 110-120 boosting it is pretty small ongoing time investment, with a bit more of an initial cost.

When you forget to take your schizophrenia medicine.
---
Are you willing to put in the time?
---
Wow they specifically said none of your progress in classic would impact your retail game.
---
You can create both factions in the same single account/subscription/server no need to purchase an additional account/subscription.
---
Sit down you only get 1.
---
There are several QoL things that have been added in retail that outshine classic.
---
That doesnt mean its better or worse. I hate the fact that items dont stack as high, crafting ammunition, didnt get my pet till ten. 
---
I love the fact that it reminds me of when I first played. Just hit 11 on my Dwarf Hunter, had my bear for a whole level, been grinding out Frost Trolls for cash.
---

I can confirm some of us are getting booted for going afk for much shorter periods of time - often as short as 15 minutes. We get d/ced back to login screen, not character select. This started happening as of yesterday's server restarts. As someone who plays for a few hours, takes a 45 minute break, and goes back to playing, this eliminates my ability to play more than just the first few hours as I spend the rest of the day in queue.
---
This is a really good tip, thank you! I think I've been topping the tank off too often, I usually throw a heal their way at around 2/3 health and I should probably wait longer.
---
I got a Warrior to 16 on Whitemane then left to a High/Med pop server after I tried to login the next day.
---
My one issue with your post - the idea of underperformers “stealing” someone else’s loot. For example, Nefarian’s Tear - how is a moonkin “stealing it” from a mage or warlock? If they won it, they won it fair and square. How is it any different from a mage getting it and “stealing it” from the warlock? It seems to be an entitled line of thinking and seems like you actually *promoting* this inter guild drama by using those terms.

Asmongold literally only got popular for shitting on bfa what do you expect

There's not much else you can do if they wont wait. There's a reason that the line "After 3 sunders you can basically start doing damage to it" is so famous :D
---
Marry this guy! Finding a man who plays wow is the ultimate score!
---
I believe in Vanilla WoW you were never meant to see the actual enemy health numbers. So I'm not sure if there's a way to display those numbers in Shadowed UF.

those take forever to spawn tho... I think I spendt 2 hours on the quest for the paws.

T. Lsf poster

It depends on the class, my hunter has no access to certain downrankings.
---
you can do this in bfa too
---
Just search for classic Deadmines strategic video.
---
And ask specific questions in /p
---
If you  explain its your first run people can take that into account with pulls.
---
World of Warcraft has 'developed' ever since 'vanilla' (original game).
---
Everytime an expansion was launched the game changed a little. Players who originally played felt less and less catered and begged Blizzard for 'classic' servers. After many years Blizzard had finally made servers available for 'vanilla' WoW.
---
My guess would be the control + key is bound in your key bindings. Open key bindings and bind anything to ctrl + key and and then unbind that.
---
because:
---
1. it's a low level dungeon where it's not that important that the tank never loses threat
---
2. it's a low level situation where the shaman doesn't have frost shock yet
---
3. it does ridiculous damage and it would be stupid NOT to use it.
---
I haven’t personally rerolled but if youre having doubts already you may want to seriously consider it, were going to be with these characters for a long time!
---
its not needed anymore, but at launch it was needed since there was 30k people in the starting zones tagging mobs. now people are spread out too much and its not needed

Yeah that I have no clue about. The current meta will quickly change if it turns out the experience is bugged.
---
I tried it for the last 15 years
---
You can shock AND Melee you know, because shock spells are instant. With Elemental devasation + flurry later on, you'll be popping windfury like mad.
---
asmonshitter was never an advocate for classic, sodapoppin was.
---
But I need to train my professions, my pets and my char. How do I even do this?
---
At least I dont have to pay for a mount.
---
I would say retail is pretty hard for the average player yes, considering how most players are stuck at 7/8 heroic eternal palace or 3/8 mythic. There won't be any road blocks like that in classic.
---
I didn't play classic myself so no nostalgic glasses, but my brother played it with a lot of friends from school. I kid you not, they were a guild of mostly 7-9 graders clearing about every raid using no comms or anything. I doubt that's possible in retail wow on mythic difficulty. 
---
Again I don't see how this argument is worth having, let the action of players speak for themselfes. I think most people that actually played classic agrees that it wasn't the bosses there was hard, it was everything that led to them (getting groups together, carrying clueless players, bad computers and internet, lack of knowledge).
---
Once again, if you play classic, you will see for yourself when you reach level 60 how mindlessly easy raids are.
---
I took it from a reddit thread I saw about a month ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpfupz/classic_wow_mage_macros/ (It's a video, but all the macros are in the second comment)
---
I took the Frost Ward / Fire Ward macro from that, and tried to edit it to fit. No idea if it's classic or retail, I had assumed it would work on classic.
---
It makes the quests more immersive for me. Also having to check the text a few times, to make sure I'm heading North East as instructed, I'll end up re-reading everything
---
Show me where in the toss it says you can't have someone else prevent you from being AFK.
---
Monkey Quest has a draggable window and tracks all you want
---
Send me your benis so I can review it
---
Only solution is sadly to play on a less populated server. I'm on one of the newer (German) ones, they still have high pop but didn't get queue in 3 or 4 days
---
Why do you care?
---
Doesn’t work with classic wow

Healers are not expected to dps in groups. Your experience will vary with the individuals in your group. It is always good to give it an attempt and learn. I would bring any mana potions you can to help but not necessary.

Shaman&gt;mage&gt;warlock&gt;warrior&gt;Druid&gt;hunter&gt;priest.

No lol it's deviates delight.

Honestly who gives a shit. That gremlin doesn't deserve a single post about him
---
I'm actually kind of mad at the dude for going that fast.
---
I've been reading most of it.  Some of it is pretty good and it's nice to know what's actually happening instead of just mass murdering kobolds or humans with no explanation.
---
Sorry, Hord just looked more badass to play!
---
Dude its so fun. But it gets even more fun with each level. 35 now and can't stop. Won't stop.
---
it's okay the faster he does everything the faster he will be back to farming transmogs in retail.
---
Just take your time and have fun :)
---
Get outa here
---
Why is this so funny hahahahahah
---
I really relate to this post. I am at a point I delay my lunch during the day to about 1-2pm so I can come home, get in queue, then go back to work until 3pm. Usually it’s just perfect or still a thousand to go in queue (Herod NA) but if I have a different shift or anything else at all to do, I’m fucked and can’t play until like midnight MAYBE. Even then I don’t get much play time because bed time for the next day. Been stuck at 2 bars from lvl 22 for daaaaays now
---
You are as pathetic as the dude you are complaining about, OP. Only difference is, he is making a living off it and you are not.
---
Anti ghost town, i wish to see it every login
---
It's too combat servers dying after the initial craziness. We've been told that over and over and still people don't listen.
---
Ur just a salty nerd who didn't check the post of the tweet.
---
You're welcome. And my situation was similar. Before launch I made 3 characters on a server that ended up being too crowded for me to use. On launch day I made a last minute decision to start on a different server, Kromcrush, and have enjoyed my time.
---
A big difference is that I did not have a group of friends, though. So the choice to swap servers was much easier for me.
---
Anyway, have fun out there. Good luck to you.
---
Very pretty
---
I have a warlock friend I've run a few dungeons with and he KEEPS soul stoning the tank! I keep explaining that he needs to SS me, the healer but he keeps forgetting.
---
You must be really fun at parties. It's almost like other people can live their lives how they want.
---
Wowhead and Icy Veins both have great leveling guides among other things. Overall classic is classic so taking the "ideal" fastest leveling path isn't always the most fun. Take the time to learn the class and toy around with what feels good for you.
---
Tauren is the best at that. I know full well what you mean and Tauren’s is a massive overhead swing. You’ll love it
---
Developers weren't interested in the money. Activision-Blizzard was interested in the money. You could see in Ion's emotionless face that he was slowly dying inside as he was forced to defend shitty casino-style lootbox itemization that had already been perfected in the previous expansion. Activision-Blizzard wanted higher "engagement" numbers, and that meant more people playing for more hours to get more useless stuff to DE while waiting for the REAL gear.
---
So now they simply said "hey let's dial it back to Classic and show the players what a REAL grind is" so now we are back to running UBRS and eventually Molten Core 100+ times waiting for a piece of gear to drop.
---
Most important thing to buy is your class abilities from a mage trainer. Sell the grey junk and items you get from mobs or quests. Buying armor and weapons isn't too necessary, try to invest in stuff like bags so you can carry more and other things that make life easier.
---
Paladin has the best buff in game. I remember in vanilla horde complaining about alliance doing world first all the time. And they blamed it on pala buff. Good times
---
Eh, the little guy wouldn't get it anyway
---
Nope, happy with it the way it is.
---
If they do,  I think they should make it simple you can still play classic too, so you are not forced to tbc
---
There's a clip of a British weather lady from Russel Howard show that you should see... If I wasn't out for steak I'd help with this.
---
It’s super nice. The video focuses more on speed, so he explains the right ones to do and the order, but really the premise is the same. LFR raids. Goodluck!
---
Post on official buy forums.
---
He could be hiding his cape, but why would one do that?
---
Most guides recommend not even training in flameshock to save gold.
---
This is definitely unfortunate. One of the main things I was looking forward to in the leveling experience was the return of actually needing to run the dungeons with CC, proper tanking and healing, etc. instead of just zerging through them as fast as possible. Unfortunately do to this bug, basically the meta has shifted to "dungeon cleave" which is just a mad zerg to pull and kill it all ASAP.
---
I don't really know if it's best at this point to fix it though because it would be really, really unfair to everyone who has not had an opportunity to blow through those levels.
---
Either way, this has taken a lot of the wind out of my sails in terms of what I was looking forward to, which is a shame for sure.
---
Not knocking anyone out there who has done it or enjoys it, play the game how you want; just not my cup of tea.
---
I’m gonna make a T-shirt that says “I found Blanchy’s Oats”
---
It's less about how we are personally impacted and more that someone we might spend some time to watch and be entertained by doesn't stick to what he said he would do and just can't help being a parasite. People are allowed to be personally disappointed in how others choose to be. It's their choice, but i can also be disappointed that they choose to be so terrible.
---
You didn't told me anything new, also, the LFG addon was going to be used by retail players more than anyone else and btw, you are thinking about DUNGEON FINDER, not about LFG, LFG is the tool used for Mythic and Normal and above raiding, not the queues
---
Also, both Dungeon Finder and LFR are bad for the game and just perpetuate the idea of WoW, a supposed MMORPG, being a singleplayer where all you have to do is press 2 buttons to clear all content, without ever needing to say a single word
---
The closest thing to human interaction you ever find in retail is the tank calling the healer a retard when he dies
---
It’s ok bud, just take a deep breath and relax. As you are new there are endless ways to level up. If you want a guide check out [Icy-veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-leveling-guide) or [WoWhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/mage-dps-beginners-guide-classic-wow) . But honestly I would take you’re time and explore. Go at your own pace :)
---
wish we could see the numbers
---
Well of course they weren't gonna have flasks and top end enchant 5 day after the opening of the servers. But i still count 5 consumables buffs on mn + the fire prot potion.
---
You're a dumb ass, people have been dungeon spamming to level since release
---
There's nothing blizzard can change about current retail that will make you forget your burnout
---
Yeah, this is wild.
---
That UI though 🤮
---
Calm down there skipper he just asked a question
---
You also were locked into skill animations and couldn't cancel an in progress animation to respond to game events.
---
The FUGS
---
this sub "wow classic is great cause you can play how you want" also this sub "people are playing the game wrong"
---
It's a feature!
---
Real Classic players/streamers know Asmon aint gonna last a month in classic, and will prolly switch back to retail after alil while. Even Soda says this. ASmon already said he will NOT even level another character organically or like how did with his current warrior. It will be a time waster he said. I feel bad for the alliance on Faerlina, because once asmon quits, the factions will be solely one-sided again.
---
Can’t tell which one you love and which one you hate
---
Honestly nobody knows. I think it's unlikely they will design all new content for classic, but rather go BC at some point
---
I'm the tauren warrior who minded his own damn business and let you aoe those murlocs. Felt bad when you got jumped by two people but didn't expect to see it on Reddit a couple hours later lmao
---
mmm crispy bacon
---
More than likely yes.
---
They have done ALOT of ground work with Classic and TBC/WotLK will require much less engineering time to get to work.
---
Basicly free money since people are willing to do th sub each month.
---
at that level the shaman at least has the excuse that they don't have frost shock yet
---
He and Frostadamus are the only ones that seem good people
---
&gt;\-3000
---
I noticed a 3000 queue drop when they did that.
---
Retail isn't as screwed up as you might think. WoW is still the largest MMO so long after release. They're fighting against an increasingly tired playerbase in a period where MMO's have limited interest among gamers following a decade of every big publisher trying to replicate WoW's success and have lasted much longer than expected.
---
*everybody* didn't do this. My server has 5 level 60s. Meanwhile, Teldrassil is completely full every night with &lt;12s. The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of players aren't doing this.
---
There is no honor in war
---
If you want to be inefficient sure
---
Hard fork its one of the reasons they didnt want to do this but I suppose money always wins in the end. 
---
Many people love retail, vocal minority but silent majority.
---
Imo we will see retail continue on its path and classic stay as it is. They both started in the same place but are now different games entirely. Classic is about the community, you being a mere microcosm in your faction and having to experience the world around you. Bfa (never played after wotlk) just looks like the focus is entirely elsewhere. These two games will appeal to different audiences and I cant see it being reconciled and nor should it be.
---
That's where I'm at now too. Rerolled from Faerlina. Loving it so far. Seems to reach high pop at night, but never a que.
---
Staff and wand or main hand, off hand and wand
---
Whole B-net crashed though, doubtful they would do that on purpose.
---
While they get to 60, I stay 20-22 and do all zone quests
---
Step 3 should come before step 1.
---
Same I've had a great time with parties. Got about 5 dudes on my friends list now that I'm happy to quest with. Everyone talks, everyone stays to help finish a kill quest if you're behind etc. It's made levelling so much fun. I'm on OCE so maybe that has something to do with it?
---
That being said I do come across people who don't want to group up at all even for kill quests. For gather quests I can kind of understand but I still think you get done way faster even sharing loot. These people I would imagine are most likely retail players
---
Legion tho
---
Also, even if the content of the expansion is bad, no one can say that the RAIDS have been bad at all, hell, WoD is considered the worst fucking expansion WoW has ever had, but Blackrock Foundry is considered one of THE best raids in the entire game
---
I do complain, although I wouldn't call it crying because what I want isn't unreasonable. I simply want to play the game I pay for playing. There are now several tens of thousand people who are stuck in queues for similar reasons and there is very little that Blizz is doing to fix that. 
---
And yes I'd say I can't play right now, as there is a queue and I'm not going to start over and do the same quests all over again. Not to mention having to leave friends and guildies.
---
im sorry your parents didnt love you :( maybe the internet will
---
31
---
Ah, classic
---
If challenge is your main goal, then forgive me for saying that Classic isn't where you'll be getting it. Classic has great RPG aspects and a fun community (mostly), and the adventure to 60 has been a blast so far (only level 8, haha). 
---
But the raids were never tough outside of gear-checks (which obviously wasn't as important as I thought). Mechanically they've always been dead-simple, and 1.12 made some changes that made them even easier. 
---
Challenging raids are in Retail in Mythic or in other games, frankly. I'm sure most people will have a harder time of MC and Onyxia than APES did, but I don't think it'll be long until they're both being farmed by PUGs. 
---
For me, the outlier is Naxx, since people didn't really get much of a chance to explore it when it was current (and it was known to be super difficult). Mechanically I don't think it's much compared to most modern raids, but we'll see, I guess. I wouldn't expect much challenge out of the other raids, though.
---
It's impossible on pvp servers. If your friends are on a pvp server you can only be one one faction.
---
Ordering this cookie cutter tonight!!!
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Not how it works
---
Maybe, but there is WoW and he makes more money than you by literally sitting at home and playing a video game, so who is the real loser here?
---
People who were already playing WoW will keep paying, whether that's for Classic or Retail. 
---
And a *lot* of people who weren't playing WoW subscribed for the nostalgic trip. Some number of those will either get hooked again and jump onto retail, or keep playing Classic for a while until content dries up.
---
To show their butt ofc
---
Pretty little rocks, just for me
---
I can't wait till that really kicks in and people either learn some manners or gtfo
---
It doesnt.
---
Rerelease TBC first plz :)
---
Yeah, that's very time consuming. Back in vanilla you do need at least three runs to farm a shield for the MT, but is it still necessary in classic which is baselined on 1.12 but only Rag and Onyxia are open for raiding? As a matter of fact, all classes and talents had an overhaul in that patch while previous raid bosses were nerfed, which was why APES were able to down Rag and Ony in week one without spending time to gear up and many of them were not even 60.
---
Where can I find quests for SM?
---
Nobody can predict which will be more fun for you
---
The second time i've been called a sociopath today for ganking. I must be doing something right.
---
A novel suggestion though - if getting ganked makes you upset in real life, roll on a PvE server. I'd rather play with people who fight back anyways.
---
You can have a wand with any combination.
---
A staff will use (2 hands) while a dagger will be main + an off hand.
---
The stats of the weapons for you 2 hands will figure into your spell damage. By stats I mean isn’t, spell dmg , etc...
---
Your wand damage is shown on the wand itself when you shoot.
---
I do the same, I guess we probably should err on the side of caution and queue slightly later.
---
He's a parasite. I thought he would do this right because he said he would. He couldn't hold himself to it. So I'm allowed to be disappointed in people when I give them the benefit of the doubt and they prove their shit anyways. Stop being a mindless sycophant. He's being carried because he's too weak to do it on his own in the face of temptation.
---
Elysium was the same server as Nostalrius right? If so it was nowhere near 800k active players, they barely even had 15k concurrent players  when it was shut down for good.
---
Doing too many of the red optional quests can throw off the leveling plan and you might end up with some quests going gray later on (they’ll still give 80% rep after just one level). As far as the level headers, that is the approximate point in the guide when you should reach that level, and everything after that will lead up to the next level milestone.
---
I literally sat and watched him fish for like 2 hours dude is so chill
---
The chances of fucking up on counting to a million are immense to be fair. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't oneshot that challenge at all. The more I think about it... the more insane it feels. Even counting to a thousand would be a challenge for me. 😂
---
I rerolled on a server released on the day of release, and I still risk facing a 2 hour queue if i don't logon before noon..
---
arent they alli? if you think tahts long, check out the horde attunement lol
---
please dont let cookies and fan art leak into this sub ffs
---
Classic is a cash grab, so they won’t let you do anything like that to try it out first, but let me tell you, from someone who’s been playing WarCraft for over 20 years and WoW for over a decade, both are worth it
---
You can tank just fine as fury.  Just make sure your one handed skill is high enough to equip the shield.   
---
There are 4 main parts to tanking.   
---
Pull the minimum amount of mobs, as far away as possible other obs as possible.  
---
Never let a mob hit the healer.   
---
Never pull if the healer has less than 3/4ths mana.  
---
Let dps die if they pull aggro off you.
---
Yeah fair point. I mean like him or hate him, either ignore or watch.
---
Was the "One faction per PVP server" restriction something that existed in vanilla or is it a temporary restriction due to high population?
---
Uhmm.. amen?
---
Wow thats cool
---
Still playing on my i5-4200U with integrated graphics. Makes the game feel just like it did in '06.
---
Ouch. Imagine being mad about a guy playing video games as his job.
---
I bet you give this guy money.....that's legit funny.

I’ve just been going back to previous zones to level it

Ask them individually

That's super helpful to know. thanks.

I used the WoW to destroy the WoW

Should be around 20 GB.
---
Wow almost looks like Elwyn. Never seen it so bright
---
I've had that happen in retail more than once. Not sure what causes it.
---
It has fully reinvigorated my love of the game.  Already joined a wicked awesome guild.  The general feel of community and inclusiveness is just astounding.  Just gives you that warm fuzzy feeling :)
---
On retail, when I log in, I'm taken directly to the character selection, but on classic I'm taken to the server list, any way to change it?
---
As long as the incentives go into BFA and not into classic a lot of people won't have an issue. BFA is basically just free handouts anyway.
---
method is account sharing here is clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/SolidDeterminedTarsierPermaSmug
---
That's my point. Spend less time worrying about people not worth your time.
---
Let the man play however the fuck he wants. Why get your panties in a twist cause some other dude is playing the game the "wrong" way. It's his life and it is certainly his choice on how he wants to play. With that said I do still find it disappointing because he did break his promises.
---
My husband and I leveled as warlock(me)/paladin(him) when we first started in 2007.  
---
It’s a good combo, but the warlock was easy for me to solo also when he wasn’t able to play (he was mobilized at the time).
---
Can you link that guide? :-)
---
Those kids on espn make absolutely nothing. Blizzard just paid for their crappy game to get air time in an effort to make it an esport. There's a reason they branded it as college teams and give out small scholarships. To avoid paying them.
---
Yeah I hopped on for a couple minutes and he was in Stormwind near the bank I think, and I saw two people give him 80s and 2g, He said something about buying a mount. no idea if he was serious or not. (He probably was.)
---
This post so cringe
---
No they won't. Everyone wanted 100% authentic and this is what we get.
---
But he's been honest and straightforward about it and there are some people like myself that put that above all. I don't care that much if he's a piece of shit as long as he's an honest piece of shit. Going back on what you said you'd do makes you a hypocritical piece of shit and that's actually where I draw the line.
---
Hunters can solo Dire Maul parts for farming gold. Can also solo elites by kiting them
---
This will help old returning players who only play classic have an option to play BFA sometime without having to pay for the expansion.
---
That's a classy player right there
---
The Horde in Arathi Highlands and just outside of SFK did not agree with your post.
---
We can talk about this but you’ll first need to complete every quest on the Horde and Alliance, see you then
---
never knew it existed.. i was laughing my ass off over such a simple thing
---
I think what they don't understand that's it's not the difficulty that makes classic so great. I have tons of more fun questing and tanking dungeons in classic than I had in years in retail. People are more friendly and the entire experience is so much better without flying mounts, epics thrown at you at every corner, people running around in transmogs, leaving after 1 wipe etc. 
---
I couldn't care less if MC isn't very difficult. It's still much more fun than any retail content right now.
---
There's a Bigdicdaddy on Stalagg too
---
Well you take tap either way, and mind flay takes a while to scale. If you're going to re-spec at 40 it seems like a valid option since otherwise you're going to mindblast-swp-wand your way to 40 anyway.
---
TBH, I feel like folks shit on retail way more than I see retail players shitting on classic.
---
You can already read Chronicles volume 3 for an actual reason for why Kael'Thas went cray cray
---
But it's basically: He became a fucking junkie of the fel and started to grow paranoid of his allies because of it
---
Also, no, they did Chronicles precisely to make that the official "This is what happened" wow lorebook, for example, Med'an no longer exists
---
I don't have any 110s or anywhere near 1. Can I do it?
---
Hes an immature neckbeard who's encouraged by his legion of sheep. Why are you surprised by any of this?
---
The beginning of the end was TBC. Flying mounts, nullifying the 1-60 content, daily quests, hallway dungeon design, and most of all, 25 man raids. 
---
I know people around here love TBC, and there's plenty of good stuff in it, but it's significantly worse than vanilla.
---
Uhhh no
---
I'm at 15 and it sucks. Just waiting for my free mount really.
---
Oh no, you're stuck in the game, better reach floor 100 and kill the final boss to be able to escape the world, but be careful, dying will result in you dying in the real world too
---
No, it's not 1.0 but 1.12. They didn't have any data prior to that (so they said at Blizzcon).
---
Here's the thing. This game *will* die if new content isn't added. Nostalgia only carries so far. OSRS suffered a similar issue where they went about five months post release with no new content, leaving the game exactly as it was in 2007. And it almost died. Blizzard needs to take a very close look at what the OSRS team has been doing and figure out what they can translate into their own system.
---
If you already think it’s boring it’s not for you. Some people like the slower pace.

I mean, orcs bite the bullet and go to TB to turn them in, you win some you lose some

Ya it’s been really tough guessing how long it’s gonna take
---
Bgm on loop 4 life

Just... don’t..

Im curious how one learns how to do these. This is next level. Im happy when I get my weaponswap macro or startattack to work rofl.

Do you use an addon or is that how regular quest log looks
---
Or any protestant church nowadays
---
Wouldn't surprise me if this was McConnell tbh
---
No, I don't play retail. Neither do any of my friends I'm running an instance with right now.
---
Ret gives you a few more tools as well as holy trees (Seal of Command, Consecration, Holy shock) but a lot of it is auto attacks and judgements. The versatility  and durability is the paladins strength.
---
i was this mage yesterday.
---
WoW classic isnt hurting retail at all lol.
---
Sadly, no. The raids would be too much to handle at a level lower than 110. Even my 110d struggle a tiny bit.
---
If you wanna know why they're doing this: They're scared SHITLESS of people streamsniping and ganking them. Especially Asmongold and Soda. Especially Asmongold. Asmongold knows many many people fucking \*hate\* him, and would descend upon him en masse to corpse camp him the second he sets foot in a contested zone. That's why they did this. Soda got butthurt so much he stopped streaming for days. 
---
Streamers love the free gold and free shit that they get from their viewers. But they hate when they get streamsniped by those same viewers.
---
It can't be stopped... It's self susrsining now.
---
I’ve actually already encountered that. “I cAn AoE bUt YoU hAvE tO kEeP aGgRo” while he spams aoe and i’m barely having enough rage to get a sunder in.
---
Yep, madseason is the shit. He's turned away so much stuff and is just my type of humour.
---
Think they added a new one yesterday.
---
If you want a good classic streamer, go watch Siv HD
---
Just let her choose herself? One of the most important decisions is in that character selection and because of that it is one of the big hooks the game has. Let her choose freely and then compliment her choice with your own?
---
Disregarding trolls: Someone legit asked my party for a summon to a dungeon. We did not have a warlock. 
---
"Wait. So the meeting stones are just.... meeting stones?"
---
bless
---
I feel physical pain when it misses.
---
Also the people actually playing retail most likely have BfA already.
---
I'm confused. Warlock couldn't manage his mana and quit? Quit on the healers behalf? 
---
Only mana tank should be watching outta healers while asking "r?" before each boss. Holding up the entire group because a dps has no mana is preventing 3 players from dpsing instead of one.
---
*i'm* the one over-thinking this?
---
Depends on whether you have installed retail or not, cause it reuses some assets. Minimum I think are 4GB but can be double that.
---
Dude is a massive hypocrite and a garbage human
---
and somehow you end up making yourself look even more pathetic than both. Gratz!
---
While that is true, they also did it with suboptimal gear and with 15 players not even level 60. It shows that if they can do that, min maxing isn't required to down Ragnaros and other specs can easily be taken.
---
This is the epitome of racism
---
"Failed classic WoW", not failed in general, is what OP is saying. There's a difference between failing in a specific aspect and failing at a job in general. He's entertaining his stream and therefore succeeding as a stream. He's being toxic in-game, according to OP (I don't watch him, so IDK), and therefore failed the "spirit of Classic".
---
4 months late but this has been happening to me for days now since release. I. Just. Can't. Decide.
---
I hate retail wow so much. Happy? ;)
---
Im not a fan of the 10 man dungeon spam myself, but it has had a positive effect in that my questing experience through STV, Hillsbrad, and Desolace hasn’t been nearly as terrible as I thought it would be on a full PvP server. 
---
Im still able to find groups and competition for mobs is nowhere near as bad as pre-30 was.
---
lol ok
---
Get a life.
---
Fortnite isn’t a game.  It’s a drug peddled to youth.
---
He's read this thread and absolutely thrown his toys out the pram preaching a butthurt rant on the "Toxic community of classic" And how we all suck at the game
---
Absolute toxic, balding 30 year old child
---
But the raiding and the race is one of the few good things about retail.
---
Anything with a pet is a safe bet, but I've found that brand new players can get bored with tab-target spellcasting and may opt for something more combat oriented or classes that use a lot of instants.
---
Well, there might still be retail players who are interested in Classic, and this gives them the final push to try it out. And personally I'd rather level to 60 in Classic than 110 on retail because the leveling is boring as fuck there.
---
Trying the Feral + Hunter combo with my girlfriend who is new too. We're level 18 and she's really loving her kitty. It gets a lot of /pats. Can't wait to break it to her I'll be a kitty too!
---
Bro, there's been people playing vanilla for 15 years and if you get burnt all you can literally just try whichever the current expansion is and come back later
---
Hell, Blizzard is probably going to end up adding TBC servers too
---
Is this satire?
---
nice, can you add the other forms and it does it for all?
---
Check out the current ffxi. Still has a lot of the difficulty and immersive story, but with huuuge quality of life changes.
---
HLs has its high points. Jintha'alor is not one of them, I agree.
---
People raid in pvp servers. I see PvP as a huge part of warcraft, so its only pvp servers for me. If you just want to run around and do your thing without fear of a sudden and unexpected battle, pve might be for you. If you like the idea of always being on your guard out in the wild, pvp. If you choose the latter, it doesn't hurt to find a questing buddy
---
Leveling skinning is super easy since you know exactly where to get that. For herbalism, there’s two things you can do. First, try to notice patterns of where to get certain herbs. Peace bloom is always going to be out in the open. Earth root on hills, briarthorn and silver leaf is always next to trees.
---
The second is expanding your leveling experience. Don’t just stick to one zone. For example if your alliance and you are level 13-14, chances are westfall is your next destination. But you’ll eventually get quests where mobs are level 16-19. So go to loch Modan to quest get your level up there. Since your leveling in two zones, you are getting twice as many herbs as you quest without having to feel like it’s farming skill.
---
I use the second option, and as horde my two zones were silverpine forest and the barrens and I left those zones with 179 in herbalism. Never had to grind the skill out at all or go back to a previous zone. If you spend plenty of time in the zones that you need the herbs from, you’ll have no problem keeping your skill up with your level.
---
Yeah I remember this always being something that newbies had to learn for themselves - raid groups prevent questing and have a HUGE XP penalty that keeps this from being useful for leveling.
---
&gt; The same shit happened when method beat Limit for world first azshara. **This sub was filled with nonstop "lul limit/NA bad"**
---
Can you read?
---
We have the old itemization.
---
Never before have I seen such beautiful specimens of the ancient MooFish race. What grace and beauty.
---
naxx will be cleared first day no doubt
---
What exactly is free handouts about it?
---
Yeah that i have to agree on but from an efficiency standpoint it doesnt make sense
---
And they've only got like 5 people even playing, almost as if they're not playing classic as a guild at all.
---
Yeah looks like it. Think Classic won't be as great of a successor after all
---
Yeah but they didn't lol. Took em 3 or 4 days to find out.
---
I thought they had fixed this previously, but have seen it pop up a few times.
---
Aside from the fact that you shouldn't be leveling as Fury, I'm more on your side than most in this thread I think. 
---
Your execution was flawed (look at healer mana, make him your focus target if you need to) but your idea was correct. I'll never get mad at someone for wanting to learn to chain-pull.
---
I had a tank last time in VC that was single pulling the whole instance and it felt ridiculous! Half the mobs are normals, they barely even need to be tanked, just gather up the whole room of them (or half the room if you're not confident in your AoE threat) and keep them mostly under control. 
---
And the elite pulls are almost all single pulls, if it's at 20% and the healer isn't looking OOM, you should be on your way to pulling the next one.
---
Always existed on PvP servers, on PvE you can have toons from both factions
---
"world first" on a re-released game btw.... LOL!!!
---
I was with you up to here, but
---
&gt;Never pull if the healer has less than 3/4ths mana.
---
Is ridiculous. If I'm at low mana, I'll be drinking. If I'm at 3/4 mana, hurry up and pull. 
---
The only time you'd stop if the healer was had more than 1/3 mana would be for serious or big pulls. For general pulls and almost anything in VC, I'm not going to be losing anywhere near 2/3 of my mana bar. 
---
&gt;Let dps die if they pull aggro off you.
---
That's a shitty attitude and I roll my eyes anytime I see healers or tanks support it.
---
You're given Taunt (3 of them even!) for a reason. Stop holding onto your ego with such an iron fist and just do your job, it's a beginner instance. 
---
When I'm tanking, if I lose aggro to something I blame myself and I taunt it back. If I'm healing and I see a mage getting hit, I'll throw him heals or BoP to keep him alive. I didn't roll either class to let people die, and having your whole team die because you let a mob rub rampant to teach a DPS a lesson is insane.
---
Is wow classic really good that people aren’t going to play the other one? Or does it suck?
---
I would vote hunter too. It has the draw for her of getting a cute awesome pet. Chicks love cute awesome pets.
---
Blues and up promt you to type in delete (at least it has for ages in retail) to avoid these accidents, I guess blizzard didn't think it would be a big deal if it happened to greens.
---
It is surprisingly easy to do by mistake when you react before thinking, I've done this way to many times in other games.
---
It wasn’t bugged, it just sneakily did something different than the tooltip suggested (which had sort of the same result). The talent works as it was in vanilla.
---
Not everyone has to like what you like. Enjoy your game. Who cares what other people think?
---
It honestly doesn’t matter that much. 
---
Play what you like. Being a night elf rogue won’t preclude you from end game content and you won’t have trouble finding groups as a DPS. TBH the only time I recall seeing a specific class/race combo was high end guilds wanting a Dwarf Priest for fear ward, and that’s very niche. That’s basically it.
---
Wait until you find out you have to go in Razorfen Kraul
---
are you down ranking too? if there isnt much spike going on, then 2 casts of a lower rank is more mana efficient.
---
Exactly. Data is valuable. If they don't know where they went wrong with BfA, they can use classic to find out what people who stopped playing BfA actually do enjoy about the game.
---
i believe what they meant by that is, no exclusive transmog, pets, mounts etc for playing classic
---
This is the reason why i quit wow classic at level 30 now. Spending too much time while i have a family and good career.. The grind is too long.
---
Yeah I figured it was that. Like I wrote though I don't see it as a worthwhile investment personally. The numbers before any +shadow damage is added are these( not going to have a crazy amount of +shadow damage when leveling):
---
Lvl 38 drain life= 41 life per sec. 10% improved = 4 life more per sec.
---
Lvl 46 drain life= 55. 10% Improved= 6 more.
---
Finally lvl  54=  71. Improved=7 more.
---
  Dark pact I don't want to drop. Exhaustion I could see dropping if I played horde or on a PvE server. There are so many undead players and the lack of honor for PvP kills phase 1 doesn't seem to have caused any less PvP. Was briefly in Ashenvale and got attacked right away. 
---
 Appreciate your input though. It's a difference of opinion what to go for. I don't think there is any right approach.
---
i still dont believe this.
---
If anything it will help it when Blizzard realizes people LOVE having to interact with each other and build communities so Dungeon Finder and LFR might get finally removed so the MMO in MMORPG comes back

The mage that won WF60 layered for literally the last few bars you dramaqueen.

Bring value and having a presence are different things. Value is positive, presence is just having an effect in someway, positive or negative.

Hunters and warlocks are the easiest for a beginner.

Questie is useful.  You probably won't need any other addon.

Professions aren't vital.  You can ignore.  But it can still be pretty easy.  If you want professions to be really, really easy, pick 2 gathering skills, like herbs/skinning/mining. You can sell what you gather at the auction house.

As someone who has only watched his stream once, which was today, he seemed like a nice guy for the most part (his use of the word ‘retard’ to an audience of 65k was a little disconcerting, but ya know, gamer word) but his constant complaining about not getting the drops he wanted really turned me off. The wouldn’t really be fun if the exact item you needed dropped every time you killed a boss. Isn’

I got one of my employees and his friends to start playing. He was asking me questions about what to do and how to do certain things. It made me so excited for him that he gets to have the same experience I had. He’s the same age as I was when I started playing too!
---
That's what I have right now (corpsegrinder from RFK) but it never fucking procs so I've just been using rockbiter.
---
I'm not going to explain this to you.
---
All you need to k ow is your not getting rank 14 with wpvp
---
I wasn't aware of him until recently. He makes Sodapoppin seem mature.
---
I do watch twitch, i never said i didn't. My point is just ignore him if you dont like it. He hates on him while trying to get his attention.
---
People have been playing osrs private servers for a while. Yet when Jagex released it the popularity exploded. Getting burnt out and simply getting bored with Classic are two very different things. They will *have* to release content.
---
I would have liked it in the game too, but nope, no achievements. I don’t quite understand why people are against it, honestly.
---
Honestly I would just play whichever class sounds the most like your playstyle. Druid may be the worst for amount of buttons and things, but the rest aren't terribly complex.
---
Questie and mapster are two good add-ons. The rest aren't needed, it's just customization for what people like.
---
Take care of yourself! How are you going to be the best version of yourself with ress sickness?
---
I turned on Asmon once just to see him get triggered and dragged into a political "debate". He's a clown
---
Yeah I don’t think these people who want XMOG realize how much it would change things. How would I know in pvp if a warrior has ashkandi and could one shot me for example.
---
Yup. I had skull flame shield for a long while with best shield spike I could get
---
You are seething with anger. I wasn't even trying to troll, but your reaction made this entire interaction worth it. I hope you sort out your anger issues.
---
Pretty sure also the people who got BFA get the boost too
---
Clearly they never recovered from Vanilla WoW.
---
This accents the clear dangers of overfishing.
---
Madseasonshow is the chillest person on earth. His what class to play vid is what sold me on classic.
---
moon sheep, star sap, blue square is usually freezing trap.
---
skulls is 1st kill, x is second.
---
orange circle is a condom that you mark on someone and then laugh at them for having a condom on their head.
---
You are either mage, rogue, hunter (and later fury), or you are a supporter. Supporters won't top DPS charts but they bring important buffs. All speccs have their place in raids (except maybe cats). 
---
For example as an enhancer your role is to provide totems (especially windfury) to your melees and often you use weapons that debuff the boss. Supporters are very important for every raid and since everyone wants the big DPS, they often have spots open.
---
Afaik warri DPS is very gear dependant and is only great in later tiers. As a warri you will be expected to tank, at least sometimes. 
---
Generally you can do whatever and will probably get a spot in a casual raid, just don't expect to have a shot at topping DPS charts
---
That I am aware of as I helped many friends level this way.  But that was just one or two high level players wrecking everyone.
---
TBC and WotLK will be featured, keeping Classic servers and population healthy and progressing.
---
I'm half way to have my mount training in the house by working hard. This guy here begs for gold from his fans. Pathetic.
---
Im pushing 26 on my warrior and I have a love hate relationship with him rn. I love tanking, I hate questing, and I hate dungeon groups that don’t listen. Am I the average warrior? Full of rage, salt, and hate, lol.
---
It is a talent in the demonology tree, the one that increases your stamina. It also reduces your spirit
---
Play what you want. You could probably* be skilled enough to out duel someone with a more optimal build
---
That bit is disappointing too. Too many of the high exposure streamers are definitely approaching it with a retail mentality. It's sad. Thankfully there are others who aren't. McConnell, Smooth McGroove, Mad Season, Kevin Jordan are some who I'm enjoying still.
---
I’ll follow this up with another clarification. They group pvp well but aren’t as good 1v1.
---
Excuse us, YOU are the pro here.
---
Good luck dude. It's the dream to make profession out of a hobby.
---
What's the xp, time to lvlt, and gold tracker add on you are using?
---
No.  It's running on the last patch before BC pre patch,  1.12. Although i think they're calling it 1.13. Which means we're experiencing later vanilla stuff, like talents, linked ah, itemisation etc. But the major content (raids, dungeons, pvp system) is being time gated similar to how it was.
---
Can confirm. Twice I get a Druid to 10% hours with some windfury. He morphs away, heals then comes back at me til I’m dead. Fuck that guy!
---
DansGaming is also a solid choice. None of that spam SM boring crap that other streamers are doing.
---
what does money even have to do with the topic?
---
Quiet Sunday in Classic.

have you paid _any_ attention to the horrendous "run away in fear" pathfinding we have in classic? Walls and floors and ceilings become immaterial to a fleeing mob.
---
my Classic WoW folder without retail installed takes 4,1 GB.
---
It might not be as special to you as you never played it before.  However, it was a quality game, with engaging content, and a (mostly) good community.  Things are different now, though.  There's many younger people trying the game for the first time, YouTubers or whatever they are bringing lots of people with them, so the community will be more modern this time around I think.  The mechanics will remain the same, and they're fun.
---
Because he is a shaman tank. Warrior is there to level so he can shine at lvl 60.
---
So, Ill be fine as a night elf rogue?
---
Both Icy Veins Classic and Wowhead Classic have very comprehensive and detailed guides (classes, professions, etc) and all are written :)
---
Was wondering if anyone was going to fix this one. Thanks!
---
Hah. Hahahahahaha. God you people are blind as fuck. FF14 has both those things and has a massive interactive community and just released an expansion to amazing praise. They have LFR and Dungeon Finder. That isnt what stops a community from being built its whether YOU as a person choose to interact. My retail server is lively with chat and I always find groups for my daily WQ's. You people are fucking ignorant and stupid. Retail is not going to remove those things and you're naive for thinking so. Got you classic babies need to get a fucking clue.
---
My thought exactly
---
I feel personally attacked 😂
---
What you just mentioned sounds like a BFA version of classic. I think the point of classic was to have the game like it originally was in vanilla, not a version with all the stuff and features they added later. The only thing I think they could add would be maybe guild banks.
---
Well you can’t fix stupid.
---
Ah thanks. That would be it!
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Thanks friend.
---
But it’s not a mandatory daily grind because of daily/world quest, it’s grind at your own pace. Granted there are weekly raid resets, and most will miss out on the first few of those, but I think the “daily grind” with WoW usually refers to dailies.
---
Only do that if you have friends to play with. Most people would rather spend two hours looking for a warrior than running with a shaman as tank.
---
Disc priest might be what you’re looking for.  You can I heavy disc and focus remaining talents on holy or shadow depending on what you’re trying to accomplish.
---
LMAO. Asmongold is the absolute lowest of low entertainers, especially on youtube.
---

Please, don't use zygor to leveling, is a mess. Only its useful if you want travel and don't level up. Check their forums. Now I am using classicwow.live and it's so much better. I feel so stupid paying for so bad "leveling" guide.
---
and they don't usually call it world first when they beat the record time. So what's your point?
---
If you are ok with one button rota in raids :D
---
Don't like it.
---
I don't want the classic community lured back into retail. That's less people for raiding/PVP/etc in classic. 
---
Classic4Lyfe
---
I’ve been gaming for 30 years... there were just as many good and bad people back then as there are today. The top couple percent of gamers have gone *way* up I’ll give you that but if you’re talking your average player... not so much. If even say the *average* gamer is much much worse.
---
I mean did you try the rerelease of MC at the 10 year anniversary? God damn it made you remember how awful some people could be.
---
Either way the comparison doesn’t really apply to the kind of people who’d level up in a week... they’re always going to be at the higher end of things.
---
Its a good practice dungeon and people are always running it, gotta go to orgrimmar eventually anyway
---
You can't. Download an addon if you want that.
---
I would really love to see this game rebuilt on a new engine in my lifetime. It’s so fucking good.
---
Classic is shiny and new again at the moment.  I think in the coming months it'll balance itself back out.  It's great that one fee gives you access to either so when I'm sick of the classic grind and drinking mana water, I go fly around BFA and pwn some azerite dailies and farm battle pets
---
BFA holds little interest for me so blizz is only getting my money bc if classic and BFA if a bonus when I'm in the mood.
---
&gt; Only to spam Scarlet Monastery to level.
---
To be fair that feels like half of the playerbase right now based on the trade and lfg spam
---
No world bosses yet.
---
Flame shock is only worth using if you’ll get the entire dot damage. If not it’s a waste.
---
I think it comes from how late game when you get some good +healing gear on you, lower rank spells *do* become more mana efficient. But while leveling, it seems to all be about equal. I've been trying to time using primarily my biggest heal instead so that I'm casting less and getting more mana regen.
---
Now, Classic is mich bigger
---
In my mind the benefits of 5% crit, the attack speed from Flurry, and the massive utility from Piercing Howl vastly outweigh tactical mastery.   
---
the 5% crit alone is the equivalent to +100 agility. Piercing Howl is also phenomenal for kiting big pulls in dungeons around to let the healer catch up as well as escaping large pulls in open world combat.   
---
To each their own for sure, but Fury has always been my preferred leveling spec for classic, that is, until level 40 and Mortal Strike becomes available!
---
Why not?
---
We're all casual. I wish people realized this.
---
Yeah it's hard to solo those kind of mobs in Classic WoW.
---
I have these too. I'm not sure what to think about the price because people are selling for 7g when I know it should be worth more
---
TIPS OUT IS A FUCKING PHONY FAKE CLASSIC WANNA-BE! CHANGE MY MIND.
---
Oy, come join us @stonespine, feelsgood to actually be able to play the game after work hours.
---
Bro I’m level 15, I wanna re live it too. I won’t be 60 for a long time let alone getting through MC. I really hope they take it slow so I can progress at my pace. Not everyone is a pro gamer- I’m in school to be a doc in the US and as such have very little time- it’s extremely fortunately I was even able to play as much as I did so far.
---
I know this isn’t the best place to make this post (replying to your comment) but it needs to be said and I don’t know where else to say it
---
Hi, /u/RdotDollarsXBL

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cygw7v/out_of_all_the_rp_and_rppvp_servers_which_one_has/).

&gt; Druids are primo healers.
---
Every other class that can heal is a better healer.
---
I'm pretty certain that "reality" shows are the definition of cancerous TV.
---
That’s really only true in raids and most dungeons. They are major damage sources while levelling
---
Why does this matter tho? Why are you guys so morally righteous when it comes to streamers like you wouldn't do this shit as well?
---
some shitty rat faced neckbeard isnt playing a game the way you want him to so you post an overdramatic break up letter on reddit. lol
---
\&gt; You had a second chance to re live classic wow and you threw it all away. 
---
Asmongold actually started playing in BC, he never played classic.
---
It all just reeks of the hubris they seem to have developed. The entire classic version was basically forced on them by the community, and despite constantly saying otherwise, it seems apparent to me that they really aren't hearing what we've been saying for years: Vanilla is a better game, and the current direction of the game is going the wrong way. How were they not prepared to handle the highest numbers vanilla saw at launch? Sure not everyone that was there for that vanilla peak was going to login, but clearly many more would be. But no, they wanted to stick to their guns and prove they were so sure of themselves that Classic wasn't going to be huge, and I think it just once again shows how out of touch they are with the wow community. No doubt they're going to apologize and say they're blown away and they never could have expected this level of engagement, that's just a plain bullshit excuse so they don't have to admit once again (well not really, because they refuse to in the first place) they're out of touch with their audience.
---
Like fine milk.
---
Ganking is part of the experience. Avoid zones which are heavily sided to the other faction (ashenvale for ally for example) 
---
PvP is the best way to learn the limits and extent of your class
---
WoW is dead, long live WoW!
---
I'm on the realm Judgement EU. There's only a couple hundred people online, and the highest is level 27. Is it worth putting time into a character on a such an extremely low population server? I'm concerned about the long-term health of the place. Also, if anyone is alliance on this realm, is it more populated over there?
---
It kind of is. Yes, there are(or were, not 100% up to date there) ways to get absurd amounts of gold quickly, but they're not quite accessible if you haven't already invested some time in the game.
---
Last expansion I could make 150-250k an hour selling m+ carries, the content was easy enough, we could plow through +15's even as a, for all purposes, 4-man group. The longest dungeons would not take more than 15 minutes, and would net each member ~40-50k(+TFs). But to get to that point there was a lot of time investment; Gearing up, getting to know the ins and outs of each dungeon, etc.
---
The same could be said about any other activity in the game, as casual as they may seem, they all have their own little requirements. So unless you already have a foothold on retail that's not something I'd recommend you to do.
---
&gt;Zandalar Tribe
---
that is PVE-RP?
---
You're doing it wrong
---
Even so, it’s more efficient to run those dungeons with good 5-man groups than raids. This only helps the bad players or shitty classes. In the long run it doesn’t matter. People blow through the dungeons without CC regardless. Hell, I’ve ran dungeons without tanks (5man). You should’ve just played the game instead of wasting your time with this post.
---
Doesn't make them better players than Method at WoW though, as much as you guys get your panties in a twist when ppl say that retail players are better than private servers (which they FACTUALLY are)  these players  need to shut the fuck up and prove to us that they can compete in the mythic raiding scene.   
---
People might hate BFA but you're literally the biggest retard in the world if you think classic raids can even compare to the difficulty of Mythic  raids. 
---
Classic has been cleared, there's no world first, that happened 15 years ago. Trying to ridicule a dude who's stating facts is just braindead  and proves why the Classic community is so trash.
---
They stated this before the game was even out.
---
So you're saying they spent millions to get classic up and running, just to not update it well and abandon it? Riiiiiiight. Try to think a little more instead of wishing the worst for everything, bud.
---
Wanna know why people in WoW chose to not interact?
---
Cuz Dungeon and Raid finder and groups with auto-invites to do WQ exists, so it doesn't matter if 2 people try to interact, cuz other 8 will just be robots
---
Also, you might think I'm not a retail player or something, but I am, so don't try to come up with this "I get groups for my WQ" bullshit like if we both didn't knew all we have to do is press the eye icon right next to the quest and automatically join one of the groups doing it, cuz that's how you make groups in retail, if you talk to someone they are going to either ignore you or decline your invite and you and me know this is what retail is right now, so if I'm "ignorant and stupid" for expecting people to one day have to TALK TO EACH OTHER IN A MMORPG then you are a full of shit liar
---
If you can stop yourself from getting kicked go for it, no judgement here, this is on blizz’s shoulders.
---
Who cares? Don't watch the stream then and play the game. I cannot imagine having such an emotional response to someone else playing a video game.
---
[QUEL](https://twitter.com/QuelFabulous) drew this
---
I can honestly say in my years when I played wow the most fun was the first week playing and knowing nothing and second was levelling an alt slowly.
---
I don't think you need to abuse layers, you just need to get a group going, stick together for an hour or two, and knock off those quests in a fun way!
---
Graphics? Lol, we're talking about backend. 
---
You don't know anything about software development or servers. PoE is fully done in instances, which makes it easier to spread the workload across multiple servers, you never have thousands of people in the same area in PoE
---
Is there any special order to questing or do they infinitely generate quests? Should I be looking for particular quests or just do every quest I can get?
---
As a returning WOTLK/Cata era player to vanilla I will say thing that made me leave to begin with was the simplification of the talent trees at MoP (as well as just less time to play post college).  
---
Thoroughly enjoying myself in classic (aside from there still being hours long queues on my server which may put a HUGE damper on things once my vacation days are done after tomorrow).    
---
I've grinded SM some yesterday and today personally and it largely is because the early 30 alliance zones just feel terrible or already laden with griefers roaming in groups targetting squishies (playing a priest).  Moving on to desolace now after a very out of the way run (which again was a reason I grinded SM some because it is so long a walk to get to desolace for alliance).
---
I think there is a balance to be had with SOME of the retail changes but there are key ones that were quality of life changes (summoning stones, reduced respec costs, fleshed out talent trees, increased number of flight points, etc) that made the game more about doing what you want and less about being pigeonholed into grinding and made your character feel like 'you' instead of just another member of your class).     
---
There also are changes that kill the key things that have made classic feel great so far (community) like LFG/LFR,  level boosts, different raid difficulties and by extension shrinking of raids because they needed more skilled members/more time sunk,  rep grinds that locked races behind them, long repetitive power grinds that just result in being stronger and not feeling as though you improved your character (i.e the raid progression in classic keeping all raids relevant compared to gear catchup, etc.
---
i didnt even consider that my bad haha
---
Any popular streamer gets fed 
---
Gold
---
Items
---
Conviences
---
This is not unique to classic
---
Hold onto it, it's a pretty good ring for 19 twinks.  Currently it's not worth anything significant because there are no twinks and there's no gold.
---
Yes you are lmao. I'm not saying you should or will be banned for it, but theres literally no way to say that that isn't account sharing. Someone else played your account, doesn't matter who did or for how long.
---
I too was shocked by how big of a douche bag he seemed to be.
---
His monotone voice is so comforting. I don't know why.
---
Once a Rogue, always a Rogue! Although I'm trying out Human Rogue this time. Me and a old friend in high school had almost identical Gnome Rogues and had a blast in world PvP. Felt like Yoda jumping around killing shit.
---
No really since there's only like 10 method players actually grinding. It's pretty obvious to anyone who watched that they weren't going to be anywhere near first to anything. I dunno if it's genuine ignorance or actually toxicity but sometimes the "classic community" just feels so off.
---
Warlocks have abilities to restore their health as well. And also, i rather have my tank survive longer than a warlock pushing out 3 shadowbolts extra.
---
As for now, when I'm doing dungeons, either the fight is going well enough that we don't need every bit of dps to get through it before I go oom and the tank dies, or it is worse enough that every bit of mana I can spend counts.
---
Also every lock I've had until now did the lifetap between pulls. And I ain't gonna heal you only so I can drink afterwards. I had a lock flat out tell me he had no drinks because he just lifetaps. Well if he can just lifetap instead of drinking, he can just heal himself, because I'm not drinking for him.
---
Quests are cool because they appeal to a lot of different player types: for people who like concrete, measurable goals they offer another set of boxes to tick off; for people who like to get immersed in the game world they can introduce NPCs and plot points and setting details in a way that's more interactive than cinematics or lore books; for explorers, quests can be both an excuse to go check out a new location and a reward for exploration when there's a questgiver tucked away someplace off the beaten path; for social types they funnel characters into the same areas and give them common goals to group up and work on together. Even outside the game quests give players a set of common experiences to bond over on the forums or whatever.
---
While you’re levelling, stats don’t really matter tbh. Most of your gear will suck. That being said I always prioritize spl dmg over int, spirit, etc
---
I tuned into XN stream last night and he said he was actually shocked to discover that MC was easier than on private servers.
---
They must be so fucking desperate lmao.
---
Always figured the best flying fix is make it only on the zones/area it's required like uh.. the pink zone in northern outlands. That way it's just a cool extra mechanic not the game changing thing it was.
---
According to Monkeynews from APES the optimal comp is warlock/mage/paladin/priest/warrior (who's main job is looting lol)
---
Between discovering mmorpgs with classic 15 yeara ago and now I played a couple games D&amp;D. I got so much more appreciation for the RPG part. Granted I still skip over most quest texts but damn it feels good to go on an adventure. No guides. Still lvl30 even though Ibhad the week off. It's so good. And everyone is so nice I cannot stress this enough. Yea there'll always be some jerks but I thin classic right now has the best community because almost everyone involved really wants it to.
---
I can't really understand the issue? You can manually put in any number you want, certainly there must be one that fits you, right? I have mine on 0.68 or something, try smaller intervalls
---
It’s not necessarily being casual to appreciate the scenery as one is leveling; after all, the main appeal of classic is the nostalgia for some of us. The value in the game comes from what you enjoy the most. I have some characters that I take my time on and other characters that I level quickly.
---
Yeah, you could be a 32 year old father of three like me.
---
Take THAT demographic statistics.
---
I might be a bit weird, but I never watch a stream if I'm interested in or playing the game.
---
No he doesn't. Terrible unoriginal video. Fuck off. I love the 0 upvotes.
---
KKonaW
---
and I'm jealous.
---
here I am at level 30 with like 6 gold to my name.
---
Which is faster for leveling up? Killing creatures or questing? Which should I focus on more?
---
&gt;Majority of players spam dungeons in raid groups, majority of players exploit layering, majority of players are cheesing the hell out of this game. 
---
Definitely not true. The masses are the people playing normally.
---
Is there still the option to play to level 20 for free?
---
They are a form of damage sources for leveling, but not major.
---
That's account sharing.
---
I'm a new player coming to Wow for the first time with classic and I'm loving it. I had played on a PvP (BGs) pserver but that's it. I know what raids are, but I've never done one.
---
Good alliteration. You'll forgive me if the phrase reeked of the kind of weird shitty internet machismo that pervades the WoW community and especially some streamer communities.
---
High population servers are more fun for the multiplayer aspect.  If you don't care, sure.  But if you want to have the option of several big guilds and more active players I recommend you stay on a high population server.  Don't get me wrong, smaller servers are fine too.  Especially if you find a small guild with active players that actually log on and do stuff.  I had a horse char on a high pop server and an alliance char on a low pop server.  Don't forget auction house prices are also affected by server population.
---
There's a finite number of quests. Do quests for your level and if you struggle then skip it.
---
Q4 report, enough said.
---
The community is dumb though
---
I mean id call myself a beastmaster hunter not mm. Considering a bm hunter wont have trueshot aura
---
You get intimidating shout which is aoe fear and bandage when theyre feared. You can also hamstring to slow(arms tree has improved hamstring which can immobilize) these are your escape tools. You have charge/intercept which can stun but these are not escape tools on 1v1. You need to pray for fat crits if you wanna kill someone that attacks you from behind
---
Playing on a PvE server in Classic seems weird.
---
And that's coming from someone who's exclusively played PvE servers since I started playing WoW. There's a reason almost every realm Blizzard has added afterwards (on EU at least) are PvP.
---
Most of Classic is raiding so you can do PvP afterwards. Blizzard then changed their mind of what the 'purpose' of WoW was afterwards from "raiding to excel in PvP in classic" to "Raiding to excel in raiding" afterwards
---
You are not alone. That's farther than most old vets from classic are going to make it. Any "vet" who played past Cataclysm is a no-lifer, a kid, or a tryhard look at me. There was one era of World of Warcraft, and that was Classic-&gt;WOTLK. Period. End of story. Go back to retail.
---
pretty sure gold in pocket is only on retail, but swapping gold for a token/game time, also affords classic time since they're linked to the same paid account
---
Stacking soul shards!
---
Traditionally, power levelers recommended avoiding dungeons as they are less time efficient than solo questing. Casual levelers still like doing dungeons because they're fun, change up the pace, and also contain the best loot at any given level which makes solo questing easier/faster. 
---
Progamers noted changes in elite mob health and armor pools (and maybe XP) compared to private servers and recognized that dungeon grinding would be the fastest and most reliable way to get to 60 fast. This strategy requires specific group That's why you may hear about it a lot online.
---
Sorry to hear that’s happened :/ glad you’re sticking to your guns and playing the way you want to play. Hopefully the community will calm down once some of the haters are weeded out and we can earn back your trust. Til then I hope you and your guild enjoy the game. And if you wanna add someone who won’t /spit at you the name is Hakan -Tauren Shaman✌🏻.

Grinding is faster, but combine it with quests to make you a bit faster, and also keep you sane.
---
Not sure the server pops you guys are dealing with but at 10 am on whitemane there are plenty of ppl to justify layering in the barrens.
---
Because they know you are broke ;p
---
Unknown. Some of the community want that, some want a new development path along classic's design philosophy and tend to refer to it as Classic Plus.
---
Blizzard has stated they're not sure where it's going yet.
---
What does that add on do?
---
Asheron's Call had spells that exchanged stamina to mana, health to mana, mana to health, mana to stamina, etc. All of them cost mana + the resource you're taking to restore the other resource. So if your mana conversion skill was shit then it would barely do anything at all. Pretty funny
---
Ftw ;)
---
I know red is ability cool down and blue is your auto stack cool down
---
Yea, he changed it. That was a super weird move.
---
I legitimately laughed at this. 
---
LLOL?
---
I dropped down the menu and it only says 'WoW1'
---
level 1-20 in that game was incredible.  i think they ran out of time as after that it was a "regular" mmo.  still very good until about lvl 75 where you completely ran out of ways to level outside of pure grinding of instances (which also sucked)
---
sanctum of burning souls though... god damn what a dungeon
---
Don’t much care, I skimmed, not the only example of them being shit

Never played vanilla. What spec has the most synergy with getting the biggest crit numbers possible? I love seeing those huge yellow numbers. Pls and thanks for th help

Playing Warriors a blast but just be warned you are extremely gear dependent, when you're well geared it's one of the most powerful classes in the game when you're under geared it sucks
---
They will never merge. They will offer realm transfers from high pop realms with queues to low pop realms.
---
The post you’re responding to is advising against trying to farm for tokens if they’ve not played retail....
---
Why pretend money isn't relevant..
---
It's hard for me to watch someone when I don't have any respect for them. It's important to me that people do what they say. That's my red line.
---
Eh it’s not comparable. Game starts at 120 in retail and that’s not the case in classic.

Dude.  Enjoy that wilderness and that lake.  Where are you?  Saranacs?
---
No in the Blizzard Start Screen. You will have the option for Wow Classic
---
I'll rip the secrets from your flesh!
---
Yeah first time in classic, quite enjoying it, already got almost 4 days played lol
---
I put about 1000 hours into wow between TBC and Cata, but only ever as dps. I’m thinking about going alliance tank, but I have no idea what to pick between warrior, pally, or Druid.
---
Level 10, hop on the tram and head to Westfall.
---
but this is classic - no changes
---
Go be a sycophant elsewhere.
---
 Aren't there only like 7 people from their main team racing through Classic? Were they gonna do Rag with 7?
---
Instance quests don't bug me as much but yeah that's another blocker to really doing at 20 (without high level friends to carry you)
---
And i just hit 22 with my “lets try another class” to re- roll “main” again lol
---
Well no, it comes down to what you prefer. Smoothness or image quality.
---
Dude I found this guys guide too and it was amazing. He was so detailed I found myself even listening to some of his other class guides that I don't even intend to play
---
It is about playing how you want. In fact, the person you're responding to specifically says that. He's just pointing out the hypocrisy of saying "We want Vanilla because of reasons X, Y, Z" and then doing the exact opposite when Vanilla comes out.
---
It makes it seem like he was just using any argument to get ***his*** way, even if it was a dishonest argument or one that he doesn't even support.
---
Those fields aren't even particularly green.
---
Shut the fuck up. I don't know or care who asmongold is. Shut the fuck up you stupid zoomer you and let him play the way he wants. Go play on a different server you fucking retard. Boo hoo he doesn't play the way I want him to shut the fuck up
---
There are other people in the world to talk to and quest with in Classic that are on your server and part of your community. You can't just pull 10 mobs and burn em down in Classic and burn em down with ease. You have to make friends and join a guild and talk to your server community to do dungeons, which actually took time and some semblance of difficulty instead of pressing a button to fly through a dungeon with silent, nameless faces. Quests actually made you explore and go to different areas instead of taking one linear path through the zone. You don't get any power increases while leveling in BFA, especially if you have heirlooms. In classic, a simple green can be a huge power boost whereas in BFA every item for your level, if you don't already have heirlooms, is going to have the same stats based on your current level and aren't really gonna feel that powerful since you're never in any real danger anyway.
---
God I hope not.  It's very fun when you see the same people over and over again.  Like in a PvP server you'll see that same enemy kill you every once in a while, then rivalries are created.  It's literally its own world.  Very fun to experience.
---
way to prove me wrong buddy
---
Implying store mounts were the reason, lmfao
---
Asmongold and Esfand didn't give a shit about levelling fast, and they still did it.
---
!RemindMe 8 hours
---
Don’t put for sale until the AH stabilizes
---
Scroll down to the lower ranks of wow streamers. You’ll find lots of people just playing. GL!
---
Definitely had to pay him a visit on my first trip to TB.
---
Buddy, I'm just asking a question if they are going to fix it... Lol... I wasn't complaining.. It was a question. I'm willing to wait 3 hours to play on this server.
---
The tool tip says it generates a high amount of threat. All you have to do is read.
---
Honestly, he is probably set for life. He has 25k subs + donations, he probably makes around 200k/month.
---
I mean I am shocked that an entertainer is bullshit.
---
do you really think that Chris Evans is capt. america? or if any of the tonight's show hosts are really that personality IRL?
---
like at this point, streamers = entertainers, they may come from esports background and have some chops, but more often than not, they are just entertainers, not strictly the best at the game.
---
being best at a game is boring, you are thinking of how to min max, not how to make a good show.
---
&gt;He keeps shielding, and going for the big inefficient heals rather than downranking and being efficient.
---
Downranking spells is less mana efficient.
---
If you think one mob will move the bar that much you're insane.
---
Unless you’re destro or have a bad wand your wand probably does more dps then immolate
---
We do care about the game tho. Gate keeping is always wrong though I don’t fully blame the classic wow elitists, they’re just trying to stop the game from turning into retail.
---
I disagree with the community thing, my server is packed and I’m always interacting with people and making friends. Can’t say the same for Retail.
---
no, these people are misleading you. escape artist is incredible in pvp. the whole "racials don't truly matter" thing only applies to PvE, if you are not playing a gnome you are gimping yourself.
---
Don't know what I had back then, but right now it's 2160p and i still have to scroll.
---
But WoW Classic is easy... It was hard back then because it was a brand new MMO with no knowledge of really anything.
---
After so many years of private servers, information being released, beta testing and people playing WoW expansions, the game became incredibly easy. Incase you didn't notice, a team of private server players rushed to 60 and cleared Ragnaros in less than a week. It used to be hard, it's not hard now though.
---
Can you explain for those that have never played BFA?
---
Yeah the issue is Classic needs to beat retail's sub numbers several times over to out-profit the microtransactions.
---
That said, Activision hasn't had a lot of wins lately, so they may cling to this exclusively to keep Blizzard a worthwhile brand, even if it doesn't make as much.
---
You're right. We dont.
---
Yeah I know that's how they do it mostly, although there have been server merges in the past. The servers that are currently full probably won't have queues anymore in a few weeks time so I doubt anyone would change to a low pop server by the time they offer a free transfer from high to low pop. I guess we will see. Currently the population looks very healthy on almost all servers so I wouldn't worry too much yet.
---
Vanilla WoW was wonky with attacks, if you performed them at the wrong time it would interrupt your auto attack and use the ability, forcing your character to then have to go through the auto attack animation again, causing you to lose DPS... if I explained it right.
---
This mod for shows when you're doing the auto attack and the bar will be red meaning you shouldn't use an ability during that period, when it's safe to use an ability the bar will be white.
---
sword in azeorth from sagares
---
I maimed feral in BC, so I'm fairly familiar with the vanilla concepts. Lots of power shifting I'm sure.
---
Nice, but ima play warlock
---
Gotcha!
---
Yeah dealing with merging AHs, names that are taken on both servers, databases, all a massive nightmare compared to letting people choose to move a character.
---
Well we've known this was the strategy for Classic since we learned the sub was shared 6 months ago. They want people to crossover. You can bet the phase drops for Classic will be timed in between content patch launches in BFA as well.
---
Yep.  I actually played SWOTR at release and most people coming from WoW were mentioning how terrible and clunky the gameplay/engine was.  Of course we were flamed out of the forums by blind fanboys but so the story goes for every new release.  Went back to WoW shortly after and SWOTR went FTP like a year later lul
---
I never understood why people watch Asmo anyway, but this was funny to see. I checked a few streams during classic launch this past few days, including his, and groaned as soon as I saw the dungeon spamming. Booooring.
---
It’s worth countless lives of middle earth.
---
Reddit was Not built on memes.... l2 be older then 12.
---
&gt;That is such an over dramatic term, 
---
I mean, not really. There are plenty of functionally 'dead' games that have relatively healthy numbers of active players. When you can go through an entire zone without seeing another player, even on a high pop server, that's a dead game.
---
Why clog up the game if you aren't playing?
---
OK, sorry new to Wow.. Someone on my guild said that they should add more layer. I didn't know what that meant. Thank you for telling me what it means..
---
It's something you can watch while doing other things.
---
Ziz and Nugi will probably be busy with PoE and will also be in EU
---
My realm is never full and I'm always taken to the server list too.

I've seen a very interesting video today, which basically concludes: doesn't matter. The enchants are balanced to do equal damage. The slower your weapon the more damage flametounge does. Frost is good when mobs like to run and windfury is cool for the oneshots. While flametounge is very consistent. Rockbiter is indeed nothing for dungeons. I think frost has the best utility, but im still a windfury boy
---
Streamers like Asmongold are mostly about the interaction with his chat. The entertainment people get is from watching the events he puts on and his responses to things his chat says. It's a lot more like watching a podcast or talk show than it is sports.
---
Some people want to enjoy it differently. I want to get to 60 which is what I didn't get to do as a kid. I want to be part of my guilds core raid group and get through all the raids and be ready for each phase. I want to get rich as a mage and have the cool pets and farm the cool mounts.
---
I'll make an alt later and enjoy that too, at a slower pace probably, maybe read all the quests again. But my priority is to enjoy the parts I didn't get to enjoy the first time.
---
Getting so sick of people telling me how to enjoy the game. I am. My toxic ass guild leader is doing this same thing, telling people how he thinks people should enjoy it which oddly involves skipping all the content by grinding dungeons in 10 man groups.
---
Should I play as a gnome then?
---
He doesnt really like vanilla as a game and the gameplay of it. Its all fake. Thats the truth. He convinced himself that he likes vanilla, but he doesn't. He is a retail kid.
---
He said it himself. he hates leveling, he doesn't like how slow it is and you need to walk and so on, pushing through the struggles and obstacles, figuring out quests and so on, or that you can be ganked. 
---
Imagine supposedly liking vanilla and being a fun of it and hating questing/leveling in it?!!!! 
---
Pretty much all ppl that FOR REAL love vanilla as a game, enjoy questing and 1-60 journey and its one of the favorites parts of the game actually. soda, staysafe, esfand etc. asmon doesnt.
---
He doesnt like to farm gold, he likes to be given things. For instance staysafe said he doesnt take gold/gear donations, not because of any moral stance or anything, but because it makes the game less fun. You are stealing the game from yourself. Its like playing with cheats. playing with cheats is maybe a fun for an hour, but then what?
---
Asmon doesnt care about such things. (again he doesnt like vanilla gameplay). to remind you, Staysafe plays on the same PVP server as Asmon. somehow it didnt stop him, aswell as duo leveling in the open world through quests. 
---
He continuiosly shitting on vanilla pve and raids, and says how unintrested in it he is, and how they suck in comparison to retail raids. Pushing maximum out of your chracter (farming for hours "to cut few minutes in a raid") etc. He isnt intrested in speedrun meta either.
---
He said he doesn't like bgs either, Esfand was all enthusiastic about it, Asmon is like whatever... i don't care, "we do it abit i guess."  Twin peaks is his favorite, he thinks its much better then wsg, and he hates arathi etc.
---
So what does he like about vanilla? he really doesn't like the gameplay of it, thats why he avoids it. Thats all the points that you wrote. 
---
To sum up: He isnt excited about bgs. Vanilla pve perception is that its shitty and borefest, and who cares. Pushing limits of your character is stupid. Leveling sucks, slow and he hates it. Gold/items/enchants etc. i dont enjoy going throught the struggle and farming it myself.  just hand things to me.
---
Only thing he enjoys in vanilla is the large scale open world pvp battles. Everything else he doesn't like about the game. Thats the truth.
---
then play pve, but apparently their ego won't allow it.
---
i hope they do what PoE does (and what OSRS does with deadman mode) and make challenge servers, with the existing content "remixed" and new things added.
---
I hope they dont do what they are doing with retail and just add a new raid tier every 4 months.
---
God I can't wait for the comparison posts to stop. You like classic, okay classic. You enjoy retail? Cool, nobody gives a shit. Not every feeling you have requires a post about it.
---
Yeah as a Priest I don't even drink unless we're going wild with pulls and the healer will probably end up dying eventually if you want to leave the DPS to die lol.
---
&gt; Honestly I was stunned, who the hell are these people?
---
It takes time for the whole "you have a reputation on your server" thing to take effect. Blacklist them, move on.
---
Except 3g now is more valuable to most players than 30g will be in 2 months time.
---
Perfection
---
There isn’t that much ganking normally but phase 2 is going to be crazy.  You should be able to avoid it and you should go with your gut. Worse case scenario you just wait to resurrect until someone gets to bored to camp you. Which is usually 5 minutes. Play the game the way you want.  If PVP motivates you then go for it. As long as you don’t play the most competitive servers you will be fine.
---
You actually can get R14 from world pvp. And it will be done in Classic.
---
When I read you thought highly of him I thought this was actually just a joke post and I hit the punchline. Sadly it wasn't..
---
Look at the mechanics from classic and then look at the mechanics of literally any modern boss. Retail mechanics are ten times more complex than anything classic had to offer - people just had no idea how to play these games and the resources (add-ons, strat videos, etc) did not exist like they do today. Classic WoW is a joke in terms of difficulty.
---
Like, the best range class literally just presses one single button for their rotation. C'mon, classic is objectively simpler and that's totally fine and expected.
---

---
Above the play button you have a drop down to select which version of WoW.
---
Yes, it's stupid.
---
As far as I know, Warlock is all about high shadowbolt crits.
---
i cant tell if this is a troll post or not
---
herrr derr games been out 4 days and you arent a complete pro at it!  Get a life dude.
---
Just watch staysafetv lmao
---
Maybe that's true, maybe not, but Classic is a finite game, it's gonna run out of content, and people will go back to retail anyway.
---
Did you buy all of the pages?  I don't get it.
---
I get that it's a little gain but each tick adds up and lowers downtime to speed up leveling. This is the logic I see behind the 5/5 improved drain life at least.
---
Sometimes I wish wow had some of the HS streamers. Brian Kibler, Day9, Trump, Dog... Fuck even saltlord kirp would be nice
---
Behold the field in which I grow my fucks! Lay thine eyes upon it and thou shalt see that it is barren.
---
I had to buy online gold from farmers for my epic mount.. I just didn't have the time or patience.
---
Yah I love classic and am dedicated to playing it despite the limited endgame because I love making shit tons of gold and twinking out alts. 
---
But I have no delusions that a lot of people will hit a wall post 60 get bored and go back to retail. 
---
And guess what. That is ok. Even healthy
---
Interesting.  Zerg raiding it just doesn't sound as nostalgic
---
I’m so sorry for your loss.....I’m glad you were able to find comfort within Azeroth for that short amount of time; that is why I love this game.
---
I joined on a medium server a few days ago and haven't had any issues logging in.
---
Kinda was his fault though
---
Tell em to bring you more hot pockets on their way down

I am glad you put so much effort into reading my parlor account. What a terrible waste of time and depressing life you must have. You must still be level 14.

Big fan of vuhdo in both classic and retail wow. Highly customizable.
---
Welcome to mancountry, boy. Suck it up or pucker up.
---
“That was your first mistake” on stream lol
---
I don't have much sympathy for them. The other DPS classes have more utility, similar DPS and have CC. Frankly they are just another hybrid to me, never understood why people don't think about them that way.
---
Can the someone banned be you?
---
&gt; I feel like something is different.
---
Yeah the first time round everybody didn't start the week the game released so the zones weren't as busy
---
&gt;Never experienced that on private servers
---
Private servers are poor reference point for this because mob spawns are server controlled, and without access to server code everything server side had be guessed and emulated.
---
That is probably true I guess at least for some versions of Vanilla.  In 1.0 there was definitely not any dynamic respawns, but by 1.12 I think there were.  It's a mixed bag I guess -- either way, you're definitely right that there are a *crapton* of people playing, so that greatly affects the respawn rate.
---
Personally, I wish the original algorithm took into account how many of that particular mob type were dying per minute and changed the rate for that mob instead of just basing it on the whole area's population.  500 people AFK in Lakeshore = millions of respawns for those dang gnolls up the hill.
---
You should feel like you're overdoing it  because you are.
---
Logically: yes.  
---
Linguistically: no.
---
Idc what anyone says or thinks, video games have the ability do unite people in an unrivaled way that still amazes me. Thank you for the condolences, I hope it gets easier.
---
Literally just got out of this dungeon. I play a shaman speced enhancement was healing. Had to pick up the slack from a two hand enhancement shaman.
---
Basically he wants to max dps by flame shocking then earth shocking everytime he can cast a shock. At this level thats every 6 sec and he only has 2. Also rockbiter weapon has been praised as best weapon enchant so he ran that instead of the flame enchant. 
---
Obviously he knew some stuff but it was all to the detrement of me the 700mp healer.
---
My suggestion if your a shaman is embrace your hybrid nature stop spamming shocks and cast cure poison on the tank or drop totems or just white hit and spot heal if things get dicey.
---
I’m so sorry for the loss of your brother. I started playing WoW shortly after I lost my first baby and my husband mobilized with the Army. It really was a great community to heal with and get lost in.
---
There are a lot of wow elites or they thought they were elites, the big egos.
---
Do you realize how quickly tech advances?
---
I use to play in the UK but now I live in Japan and want to play on the oceania servers, however when I go to the server list I only have the options for EU servers. I tried changing my location to Asia in the launcher but it doesn't change my choices. 
---
Any idea how to play Oceania?
---
wow classic is basically vanilla wow with upgraded graphics and other stuff and right now has a ton of players wanting to play it (many players that were playing the actual wow before)
---
Out of all the races, NE might be the worst for Warrior.
---
Your dedication is inspiring. Blood and thunder
---
I'm a 40 undead mage and saw madseason in STV yesterday killing panthers. We waved at each other and kept farming. Everyone in the zone chat was saying stuff like "if you gank madseason you are banned from groups" lol
---
you can if there are no battlgrounds you braindead idiot
---
As a priest I love chasing down suicidal warriors.
---
Yeah for sure. 
---
 But also have to take into consideration imp curse of exhaustion making you able to not die in a PvP encounter. That saves time as well. Like I wrote I wouldn't put 4 points into exhaustion as a horde lock. Fear is much more powerful on horde side. Wotf changes things for me. I rather have the very small number loss but a powerful slow I can use to get out of trouble.
---
So look at it from this perspective: What are the benefits of reducing the exp from 10 man's? The only benefit is preventing people from getting to 60 as fast. At this point, the race to 60 and both major raids are done. The only thing you'd be doing is making those objectives harder to achieve for everyone else. What are the cons to reducing the exp from 10 man's? Everyone that still just wants to complete those things even after the race are just given a disadvantage compared to everyone who has already done it.
---
The only other argument is people who want to level the closest way to vanilla as possible - and they can just not join 10 man groups if they so choose.
---
I really don't believe there's any solid logic to fixing the bug unless they they were to wipe all the servers and start fresh - which obviously isn't going to happen.
---
How would it not make a profit? The only thing that it would be costing you would be repairs from the mob farming chipping away at your gear
---
Virgin Human Paladin vs Chad Undead Paladin.
---
so its best to use my spell right after my auto attack is done?
---
It seems like everyone else wants to sing it's praises and every person says the same thing "You're wrong because I had a good experience." I seriously have no reason to believe it. And as always I'd love to proven wrong. The game is great obviously but there's no point in playing it when the entire community is set to just ignore me. If you can find me a server, or a group that actually does care and is always helping new people level I'd love to see it. But if I literally never get that experience it may as well be the same game as retail.
---
This meme speaks to me
---
I think this is a bit of revisionist history. A lot of the changes made to WoW were supported by a very large percentage of their paying customers.
---
The irony of “you think you do, but you don’t” is it’s about Retail more than Vanilla.  From LFG to Heirlooms to Flying Mounts to “bring the player, not the class”, all of these contributed to the mobile/Destiny-fication of WoW to turn it into the unrecognizable game it is today.
---
The warlock succubus scenario is slightly different though. The succubus is more of a QoL/DPS improvement and isn't crucial to get unlike the warrior defensive stance which is crucial to tanking dungeons effectively because it let's you use skills like sunder armor and make you less squishy. Most locks I know choose to get their succ after getting their mount, which is understandable
---
this is 100% wrong. Druids are really freaking good at lower levels. The key is you have to use your whole tool kit and not just part of it if you want to do well. While leveling you can basically non stop fight mobs killing them in bear form and then healing back up with mana so you don't need to drink/eat. In dungeons you have a ton of utility with dps/tanking/healing.
---
No, since you have now what? 6 expansions with dailies and 2 with WQs? Didn't do reps from Legion? Too bad, even when you're way overlevelled you can't progress at whatever pace you want.  
---
Yes, people can quit the game after they get to the end. That's precisely why Blizz introduced the system, to keep players with a reason to return, and eventually they transitioned into a system that tries to control how much rewards you get for the time you put in so as to get people subbed for as long as possible.  
---
I mean, this isn't cherry picking, this is literally how WoW was before and some people prefer that. And I'm not even playing either of them.
---
Ooooo you best save that bad boy.
---
no idea it becomes near full at peak times and goes down to medium. The world itself feels fine always ppl.
---
Hello all! What's the name of the addon that shows spawntimer for mobs?
---
I'm glad to hear you were able to work through that, I'm still waiting to wake up honestly.
---
Mark yourself on the map lol
---
Whoa... that’s heavy. Take care of yourself and make sure you take the necessary steps to heal and seek professional help if you need to. So sorry for your loss.
---
I used to do that too but that doesn't mean you can't appreciate and enjoy new things.
---
That sucks but take it as a lesson, start your own groups so can kick people like this. And as others have said, blacklist him so you don't have to deal with them again.
---
Or be a warlock and visit the trainer with 2gold and leave with 50s. Demon spells suck :(
---
Constantly see people looking for dungeon farm groups. Never once saw that in vanilla but everyone now has the mentality of getting through 1-60 like it's a roadblock. Kind of sad, but I dont think it's because streamers influenced that behavior.
---
As a side note, I've also seen people asking for levels 20+ only in deadmines and 33+ for gnomeregan which is pretty dumb
---
Remember when Rift claimed it would be a WoW killer, but then it went f2p? I genuinely believed it would be, too. Good times...
---
I sure you are. It will take time, don’t rush yourself. Grieving is so hard and so personal. ❤️
---
Based on my friends list,  it went from 10 people playing retail for about 2-3 hours a night, to 30 people playing classic all night. 
---
Nobody on my friends list opens retail unless it's raid night.
---
I can understand why people feel this way, for now at least.
---
are you really blaming blizzard for ques....  
---
i would say here YOU are the bootlicker.  fuzzy pink boots at that
---
I wish the mods would enforce rule 1. When I want to see Streamer drama I go to LSF.
---
No, just weird.
---
Unlocked ultimate mode eh?
---
Questie op
---
Found the wanker.
---
Has nothing to do with being hit hard, they're trying to bring people back who quit many many years ago
---
Imagine actually caring so much about this to make a thread and type all that garbage out, lmfao

Fact checking on point. Got the names wrong way round!

---
Thank you, I'm working on it step by step.
---
Love this shit
---
$900 each or total?
---
I think they knew classic were the thing even with "you think you know but you dont" so the devs have to split resources during BfA. remember wod expac and they said "we put more effort on delivering next expac" 
---
I dont think you give 50-50 resources on this, there are some classic tech that needs to be redeveloped like eye of the beast because blizzard lost that portion of code..and some stress test and also adopting some tech from live to be implemented in classic (API addon etc) while the live servers dont need that kind of thing..
---
oh no the humanity, that would truly ruin the game forever! /s
---
Not balanced at all. Pure DPS classes are basically the only contestors for top damage. Hybrids like shadows are generally supporters, they provide buffs/debuffs and do not as much dmg. Biggest problem for shadow is the debuff limit, so you won't be allowed to dot bosses. Still supporters are very important, even if they can't top DPS charts.
---
It is an exploit. Arguing otherwise is stupid.
---
Hello! There is a logout grace period which should allow you to get straight in. I used this myself last night to move from my desktop to my laptop when I was winding down in bed :P
---
I did. About 10s each for most of them.
---
The only difficulty in Vanilla is the grind and he choosed to skip it.
---
Play the game how YOU want. It may not seem like it, but a lot of this is uncharted territory. Lvling in classic isnt like retail where you pick a spec and stay in that tree.
---
You can just be a mutt for a while and experiment with things until you figure out what works best for you.
---
&gt; Only one tank was geared, others were DPS that simply respecced for OT.
---
This is how Classic works.. You only need one geared tank.
---
&gt;Additionally their hunter wasn't even 60 and didn't have Tranq Shot.
---
They got him level 60 and tranq shot before they needed it.
---
The money is what drives everything. Why would his merit mean anything, why would he care if some random person thinks he's a decent person or not.
---
Is he wasn't making a fortune from acting like this then it wouldn't even happen.

Haha noobs only played wow for 13 years
---
Kind of ridiculous standards to hold for someone who constantly brags about ninja looting and griefing other players and puts other asshats that do the same on a pedestal.

Interested aswell

Right on. That’s different than me or I would have definitely sent you a friend request. Anyway good luck friend!
---
Yeah, you can do it manually, but this mod makes it much easier to keep track of.

Underrated comment.  I was in the same situation last night killing those boar people in southern barrens waiting for the dagger,  shield and wand to drop. Started to get annoyed at the drop rate then suddenly realized I was about to level up. Great exp
---
This is awesome!!
---
What skills would you suggest skipping? Should I just focus on Resto and feral skills for now?
---
&gt; We thought more highly of you. 
---
what do you mean we? lol
---
Damn, this one hurts and it’s not even directed at me.
---
Then they wouldn't be able to gank people when they do get to 60 and would lose a ton of viewers.
---
He's literally escorting robot chickens and killing ogres in Tanaris right now. Stop crying and adding to negativity/drama.
---
What addon allows you to move the hotkey buttons to wherever you want like what you did with the melee and ranged attack buttons?
---
I agree and therefore have given you my upvote
---
Bartender4 has always worked for me
---
Grobbulus, for sure.
---
Not all heroes wear capes! Ty
---
NO
---
The irrelevance of your point keeps amping up. But I'll be sure to talk to that SM64 speed runner about their world first.
---
You can play when your room is clean and you've done your homework.
---
Work work!
---
Well shit my queue was 10047 but 297 minutes...
---
Is one of the things I think is better for the game. For the people who want keep on same server Ande for the people who want move on.
---
That seems like a strong reaction to someone not liking a genre of music, but to each his own.
---
It’s day 6.  Just play the fucking game and stop worrying about tryhards and streamers.
---
No, they were not ambiguous. Method was racing and Tips is just straight up lying.
---
\&gt; 2019
---
\&gt; still not realizing Asmonshit is a disgusting piece of shit.
---
I'm almost conditioned to avoid groups on live cause of all the assholes, while questing on classic me and my friend reluctantly grouped with two others for a quest and they turned out to be absolutely fantastic people and have played together since.
---
It's been such an integral part of the magic which made classic wow such a blast back in the day, that I'm amazed they've been so seemingly adamant to kill it off with most of the expansions and 'features'
---
Just use demo roar. Both this and shout are generating insane threat on classic.
---
&gt; you're handed gear at every opportunity
---
Didn't they even go as far as to make virtually every quest have a quest reward for every class? Or even at one point you didn't get to choose a quest reward the game gave you one matched to your class and spec? And was about to say that made things hard work to collect off specs but then didn't they also make it so gear changed stats e.g. dps to healer gear. God they really took out all the RPG from the RPG it's just an on rails questing game i guess.
---
Wow, I am honestly speechless. Fucking hilarious.
---
Just got 99% through and the healer leaves. Anyone want to run all the way to the end and complete none of your quests????
---
That dude is a sweetpie. He deserves everything.
---
It would be savage af. Just like the good ol times in blizz on 2005
---
Welp looked him and up and will check out some of his stuff, seemed to have a ton of recommendations. Cheers
---
Could never watch Asmongold. He is absolute garbage
---
Yes, Make Azeroth Great Again is a MAGA hat. The day you leave will be a good day.
---
Did I really click bait this or do you think I just didn't realize people knew about this and I just figured it out. Regardless take your misdirected anger and shove it dude.
---
"Rock things" LOL
---
even 10slot bags are only 30s now on my server. I don't know the price it takes to make them, but I don't think that's the goldmine it used to be.
---
I paid 1g for my 4 bags (4g in total) on Wednesday I think, lowered significantly
---
Shift clicking items searches them in the AH.
---
There's a pretty big overlap in the Venn diagram of "classic WoW players" and people who are deliberately obtuse.
---
The post says the private server guilds have to prove themselves in classic. Nobody has said shit about mythic raiding or whatever it is. Nobody cares. What it's about is people somehow believing that guilds like Method, who are all great players, would stand a chance clearing old raids vs guilds who have been speed running them for years. And they won't stand a chance clearing BWL, AQ or Naxx. That's what this entire topic is about, not mythic, not bfa and not who's the better players.
---
Not really you can do all these in one giant sweep. Handing them in halfway through would be more of an annoyance than anything.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It was clear the WoW devs had a completely different design philosophy starting with the later patches in WotLK. 
---
You mean right along the timeline with the Blizzard Activision merger and a lot of the old blood got canned?
---
Yep
---
#Alexwasright
---
I mean there are plenty of free private servers with a couple thousand players and it’s pretty sustainable.
---
Well I personally rolled druid in classic like I did in vanilla for the reasons that they are much more flexible, generally have better sustain at the lack of burst damage, and much more mobile and resistant to some CC. At lower levels they generate rage faster than warriors, and hold agro slightly better as well.
---
Warriors may be viable as tanks and dps, but not both at the flip of a switch. A feral druid in an instant can become your off tank, or throw a few heals if necessary and then go back to dps like nothing happened.
---
The 15 year old argument of why pick a druid when X does it better isnt an argument at all unless you narrow your focus to only the parts of the game that they dont excel in.
---
I think it’s Sticky Targeting in the combat settings in the interface options
---
For level 18?! No way my fury warrior would kill for that weapon.
---
Yeah that's what I did! Gonna log out a little later and start right up again
---
A lot can just be common sense or personal choice aswell, i'm not training new ranks of Fireball personally, when I run into frost-immune things I just make a new friend by tossing someone food and water and have them help me while I wand
---
Thank you, gonna try this out tonight
---
I can respect that.  Just know it will be harder finding people wanting to install another app when they already have discord.  You could also use in game voice instead then.  You already agree to wow tos shouldn't be an issue then.
---
Triggered? Go back to T_D loser.
---
Hard to see but the mouse is just on the right in the Pic
---
Druid giving gifts of MotW
---
it's free publicity and helps the game even if it does turn others away who think they're too far behind. those people more than likely weren't sticking around for the long haul anyway though.
---
Something feels really off even in the lower level dungeons. We been doing some of them with 4 men.
---
This is what most people don't realize. They think they are going to Joanna/Madcow a the way to 60 as a priest or warrior, then get geared instantly. 
---
Without a solid guild, you can't play Vanilla as more than a cheap RPG. That's why things changed
---
I didn't realize that. It's been so long I forgot it was added in the ZG patch
---
Westfall took me three times longer than it would have if there was no one else around. I tried to get Old Murk-Eye eight times before I succeeded in tagging him first
---
So the best reasoning I can see is that players with the worse leveling classes, (warrior, rogue) aren't able to go to these groups. Meaning that warrior and rogue players feel EVEN worse than mage at leveling. As well doing this encourages people to boost levels harder. Having certain classes gain more exp and exclude classes. Another thing will be if people want to boost alts to do another mc run or something its better to have the entirety of this nerfed to its intended state.  
---
I personally dislike seeing so many raid farm groups cause that isn't in the spirit of how dungeons are supposed to be completed. Hence the addition of 5 zone ins per hour etc, they aren't meant to be hard grinds. But players will always find a bug to exploit, so the problem would still be there...
---
Im personally tired of all the posts suggesting retail babies which i suppose by definition i would be considered as trash people who would ruin the classic game.   
---
This discussion was showing that someone who enjoys retail is loving classic, and how i believe these two games can coexist and be enjoyed.
---
depends. If you try entering strat with everyone at lvl 21-22, you're definitely gonna need to cc on a few pulls and will need to spread out and so on.
---
If you do the dungeons at the level were every mob is yellow, yeah, probably won't need any real tactics.
---
Well folks this is exactly why a large number of people wanted to avoid the streamer server. Their celebrity causes people to give them significant advantage, even if it's not asked for.
---
As noted here there are plenty of good streamers out there, Defcamp, Melderon, madseason, kargoz, punkrat, towliee, etc.
---
A lot of steamers and content creators have good portions of their streams or videos. There are very few I have a large problem with, but Asmongold just has the most annoying persona on camera. It doesn't surprise me that he's stopped to this level.....again.
---
I’ll still me ruin it. As it’s a right for me to do. I’ll still report it as that’s also within my right. Weather the mods remove it or not is up to them.
---
I started playing wow after watching azmon, I agree, he is a big hypocrite XD
---
Haha I was just quoting the OPs exact whine in defense of beta males sarcastically. I wouldn’t waste the time defending beta males. Or whining about people not liking a version of a game I prefer.
---
***of Warcraft***
---
This was my thought too. I wonder if blizzard will introduce new classic like osrs did.
---
Each
---
Stalagg. Same for any original server though that guilds committed to.
---
Did this guy just...click??
---
Look up 2 min mage (requires a lot of gear to pull off though )
---
They will lose a ton of viewers who WANT to see them get wrecked. :/
---
I wonder if blizzard had that on their wall this whole time.
---
Asmongold literally has his own army. He has 4 guilds with over 1k people. Im sure they wouldnt mind being his bodyguards while he quests.
---
You should avoid tanking dungeons until you're well within the median range for it. You should aim to match or outgear your group always, or you're going to have a terrible time.
---
If you want to do the dungeon earlier, just join as DPS.
---
There are some threat meter addons out there
---
Staysafe is on the same PVP server and doesnt take gold donation. 
---
Not because of moral stances or anything, but because it takes away  the fun of the game for him. Also he leveled 95% in the open world duo leveling on quests.
---
I think its easy to see who is actually looking for vanilla GAMEPLAY experience. 
---
I don't think asmon really likes classic as a game, or looking forward for such things. Otherwise he would think and do the same. for him he doesnt look forward for such things, like enjoying getting through struggles and obstacles and getting things done by yourself.
---
As a mage? Very early. You're probably very close to that already. The orcs in Wetlands are a good spot (Angerfang Encampment)
---
Explain like I’m old as fuck: yeet
---
You're fucking garbage. Eat it.
---
the other day he's in a group doing quests and they come upon a chest. 4 roll and madseason wins, the 5th says pass. opens chest, 2 10 slot bags. wow! he INSISTS the 5th person rolls, and they win. he congratulates them and carries on. insta subbed!
---
I mean i can understand soda, he didnt want to stream classic at all and just wanted to play the game without streamsniping. He usualy just does his thing, doesnt beg for loot and doesnt make those big eventa where he ask people to come and help him.
---
Asmongold on the other had asked for it, he talks way to much shit, his presence distrupts the game and overall tickles some people in the wrong way. He got big criticising retail and praising vanilla and now wants to play vanilla like retail, and even for someone like me who never really waited for classic (im having fun lvling and engaging with community but its still not really my kind of game) he is simply obnoxious.
---
Is this a first in gaming? They are literally offering an entire expansion pack for free just for playing another version of the game.
---
Do dungeons underleveled with friends and you will maintain this experience.
---
What’s so bad about 25 man raids?
---
Shaman tanks work great at lower levels. They have solid threat generation early on.
---
Yeah I completely forgot about the whole layer part. Yeah the high pop servers will probably get queues.
---
Yes, it sucks if there's anyone else in the area. You can start around lvl 22-24 but really it only gets super good at 40 with barrier and mount. I think minimum is more like 5-6 mobs. 7-9 mob pulls are good, 10-12 mobs is when you're in turbo mode (there's really only a handful of places where you can do that though). Unless you're level 40 by now or are on a very quiet server I wouldn't go full aoe spec now. You can still pick up imp blizzard and do it every now and again, but you can't 100% level with it.
---
Ugh. This is sad. 
---
Just go fucking camping and play wow when you get back.
---
Yes it would. Back then they weren't shy about handing out bans. It being a mistake in their code doesnt matter. You know raiding isn't meant to be a viable form of grinding experience, and it should certainly not be offering as much xp as regular groups. 
---
Intentional misuse of bugs of broken mechanics should at the very least get everyone rolled back that used them.
---
That would be phasing, which retail has. It could be implemented in classic but #nochanged crew.
---
You can be a pom pyro fire mage and instant delete anyone pretty much every 3 min.  Still good between that cd also.
---
Yes, it's really killing BFA by funneling more subscription money into it
---
I didn't think of him highly what so ever but yes all streamers failed classic wow.
---
Class abilities may be lesser... lol
---
I didnt play BFA cause it stopped at Legion but tge abilitues were already toned down a lot.
---
Mixed with arcane you can one shot people.
---
Overall I'd say play what you like, especially while levelling. You can always switch back to frost if you don't like what fire offers you or when you want to raid. (molten core mobs have fire resist)
---
It's min/maxing for the low experience crowd. 
---
But also, these people ran dungeons to level and likely passed the best gear to the tanks and healers right away, because they were working as a unit. 
---
You don't need BiS as DPS until you get to DPS check fights like Rag - and even then you only need a few people who have it
---
We talked about retail WoW today in the guild I'm in on Classic, and only 2 people of the circa 25 talking about the subject played BFA. The others (including myself) quit somewhere along the way, or only play the first few weeks of a new expansion.

---
Yeah each QoL thing seemed great in isolation. But then several years later you look back and realise what made the game the game has been completely gutted.
---
For someone who watches his stream a lot, you may have forgotten: He said that he is probably going to make another character on another realm and play it off stream to regain that element of it. 
---
He also stated that because of the fact that he is a streamer, he has to play in a completely different dynamic. To avoid getting camped all stream, he has to be ahead of the curve. It’s not good content to keep getting farmed. He just wants to provide an entertaining experience for the majority. 
---
Yes, he will upset some people who want to play slow and savor the mystery of the game. But as popular as he is, he has to take the game as he is doing it. 
---
Sorry if this has been said before in the comments, i just didn’t feel like scrolling down to see if it has been. &lt;3
---
Or just don’t watch streamers and play the game yourself — the way you want it to be played.
---
If you can't see the relationship I don't know what to tell you. It's super obvious. Perhaps you could try rereading my messages. Maybe I should use fewer words?
---
Yeah I was really disappointed when someone recommended me it as a replacement when I was looking for MMOs. I don’t wanna sound like *that guy* but destiny PvE felt so... empty. PvP was nice though other than the obscene amount of pulse rifle only shit.
---
Its kind of nuts how many elements of games like The Witcher and Dark Souls I’m picking up on in this game now. If you play a warrior and engage with the gathering and crafting systems, there’s a very similar feeling to it.
---
Low, medium and high are relative to the other servers. It doesn't really tell you much about the actual population.
---
Who the fuck are these people who actually watch streamers.
---
Oh shut up......5 hour queues are not acceptable at all. They should be fixing this problem NOW. They should be implementing free transfers off high pop realms NOW. It's a DATA transfer. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.
---
Creating characters on a FULL realm that you do not already have a character on SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED. This falls 100% on Blizzard for not figuring something out besides a FORUM POST 90% OF THE POP DOES NOT FUCKING READ.
---
Why should we care about how someone else play the game ?
---
Played for an hour or two in between activities. Calm your tits
