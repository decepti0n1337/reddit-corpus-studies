I´ll also leave this is not healthy anymore. Anyways see you tomorrow.
---
---
---
The old stealth is just bad animation though... the speed of the character doesn't match the speed of the footsteps. Especially w/ sprint.
---
Honestly, with a modern SSD, I haven’t seen a wow loading screen in years.
---
Sure. That's probably the best build you could make for a Ret Paladin who wants to tank. 
---

---
It's all about threat in Vanilla, not damage mitigation.Consecration + Sanctity Aura is a shitload of threat.
---
[deleted]
---
An incorrect animation lasted through all of vanilla and then was fixed.  How's that statement absurd?
---
The smooth sliding isn't walking nor running lol.  It's a walking and running animation not a standing slip and slide animation or crossing a lake of ice animation.
---
I'm fine if they restore it.  I'm also fine that people prefer that smooth one.  I'm just saying it's not a walking nor running animation it makes no sense even if it looks cool.  If my champ randomly moonwalked when I held the back button which is supposed to show me stepping backward I would think it was way cooler than the stepping backward animation too but it also would make no sense as a walking animation.
---
Problem was when you ran into another blood DK. I had to get a friend to travel from SW to hellfire peninsula because some guy thought he'd fight me over a mining node... but our self healing was bigger than our dps
---
you choose... wisely.
---
So no master Demonologist builds? Shamefur...
---
There's a LOT of people in your position, me included. I think it was WoD that crippled my view of Blizzard and BfA that finally finished it off.
---
People who have access to the beta will have two “beta and stress test: wow classic” options in the bnet launcher
---
Every tauren character I ran alllll the way to quest in durotar starting. I had to do a wallclip jump which saved me like 15 extra minutes of running lol
---
&gt; The numbers in vanilla was around 3 -5 million not the numbers people remember from late tbc or wrath.
---
Vanilla had a worldwide launch of 1.5 million.
---
TBC had a launch of 8 million.
---
WotLK had a launch of 12 million.
---
If the popular streamers are able to hold onto their viewership from a closed Beta, which I doubt, we're talking about 1% of the playerbase watching them.
---
It's not going to matter.
---
And then you accidentally HS back to trisfal when your friend says 'Let's hearth back'
---
I want to go ench shaman but all I’ve heard is how unviable it is in PvE content :(
---
There's basically a few major problems that set them back.
---
1. Druids lack an equivalent to 1.5 second heals. Druids are forced to downrank to rank 4 Healing Touch, a 2.0 second cast while talented or else it takes too long to heal someone and you just get sniped by other healers who finish their casts a full one to 
---
 one and a half second faster than you do.
---
2. In PvE that means that Druids are always slightly slower than other healers who mainly use 1.5 second casts as their bread and butter raid healing spells. Druids need a lot of bonus healing to compensate for their downranked spells having less scaling, so their healing output suffers because their casts are slower and their scaling is worse.
---
3. HoTs don't get as much scaling in Classic as they did in later versions, and hots do not stack on one target which means that you can only ever keep one rejuv, regrowth and renew up one one target at any time.
---
4. No dispel protection talents for your buffs in Classic. Dispels are insanely efficient in classic because there's no dispel resist and dispels generally being very mana efficient to cast.
---
5. Druid damage is a complete joke, sad to say. Blizzard honestly didn't finish the class until WotLK when balance and feral DPS finally became good. It honestly took them way too long to bring them up to par with other classes but it is what it is. Feral can sort of work for single target DPS with wolfshead helm/furor shifting but the class has almost no aoe which is a big downside when raiding. It also takes a *lot* of work and effort every week just to make feral function decently well.
---
Despite all the flaws I still love the Druid class and plan on playing one in Classic. Druids are strong despite all of their drawbacks. Every raid needs at least one Druid, and every warsong premade also needs a Druid because they're the best flag runners.
---
And you overestimate it lol. It will ofc be very successful - but no one can know how much. I do think it will bring back a type of game that doesn't really exist anymore and because of that alone it will be successful. But we will just have to see if people are as interested in it as they were back in the day.
---
Same reason. Portals everywhere in cata
---
Maybe because Classic WoW isn't a released game yet, and hell, the Beta has been out for what, 3 weeks?
---
Ensure you put the wand shoot, and not the wand itself. Otherwise it will just try to equip what is already equipped.
---
"pserver experience"
---
Are you memeing or serious?
---
You think druids can't defend AB flags well?
---
Agreed, priests are super fun if you like healing. I found healing in WoW to be more challenging than other MMOs and personally I really liked that! Plus you'll never have a hard time finding a group.
---
I guess his bug report was successful. Yesterday morning I ran some tests on known quests and they gave full rep when gray. However, after yesterday afternoon’s WSG patch, I ran some more tests and verified that rep decay is now in effect for gray quests. You can see the results of my tests in this thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bshono/regarding_rep_gains_on_grey_quests_closed_beta/
---
I can explain the meme but beware Avengers' spoilers: &gt;!Captain America goes back in time to live with his soul mate, Peggy. This meme is him knowing future events.!&lt;
---
&gt;We all know that the primary appeal of Classic is mostly nostalgia for those who played it (or a phantom nostalgia for those who didn't).
---
Speak for yourself.
---
They can but they aren't often used for it because there's better alternatives like mage and hunter..
---
Fuck being a shaman at 39... lol
---
Windfury is still the best mechanic ever invented
---
I'm rolling Druid this time though, so no wf for me :(
---
I mained a paladin in vanilla and took him through Naxx. Long as you don’t mind being a support class and healing/buffing/cleansing your way through raids, you’ll always have a spot and fantastic gear. PvP offers some opportunities but retribution is broken as shit until BC at the earliest.
---
AV pre-nerf
---
Fuck yeah get em dude
---
Sounds like a great plan that will last till about 2 minutes and 30 seconds after the server launches to work out which one they're on.
---
FW isn't just for PvE lol, it's amazing in PvP too.
---
That fact that they already have oceanic servers based in sydney it should be a no brainer as for the #nochanges thats already been ruined with changes so id exspect oceanic servers to be an accetable change
---
After the first 10% of the leveling experience, both Alliance and Horde are basically in the same zones.
---
I’m really hoping Classic influences Live to bring more RPG aspects back. 
---
I started in WoD and while there’s a lot I love about the Live game, I’ve done enough research on Vanilla/TBC (and I plan on playing Classic) to know that some great things were lost for the sake of convenience and “quality of life”.
---
True old school IBM keyboards were mechanical.
---
I AM WHEEZING
---
some people in US* have less, most places you get a minimum of more than 2 weeks
---
I asked a friend once how many times he clicks his mouse during a Starcraft match.
---
In the middle of one.
---
Cant play both on the same pvp server
---
Most people plan to choose their server and create up to 3 characters 14 days before launch.
---
What, lol. Hunters are not the laughing stock of vanilla at all... they're amazing in PvP and still perform better than all of the meme specs in PvE.
---
They're not topping the DPS meters but they are legitimately useful at every stage of the game. Hunters have it way better than most classes honestly.
---
Next, he'll probably give us, a "how to login solo guide."
---
Alliance has the best cities and early leveling zones.
---
Uhh, you mean 4-7 days right? What country? Do you have employment opportunities?
---
Yes, resetting prices of items is something Goblins do. But prices are volatile, and it's usually a reaction to prices of high-volume materials dropping very low. Price resets only hit people who need a specific item at a specific time, as I mentioned in my previous post you can lower your spent gold by buying at the correct time of the week. 
---
Take for example a look at [this](https://theunderminejournal.com/#us/argent-dawn/item/152639) where someone who NEEDS flasks at a specific time may pay double the price of someone who checked the AH every now and then and makes sure he has something available.
---
In fact, "stupid goblins who go too far" are usually not fucked by farmers, but by other goblins who post their stocks because they want to sell their own stocks, undercutting eachother until the prices normalize. It's often these goblins that make the fall of price go so quickly as you can see in my provided link. 
---
Full items are less than mats usually because of profession rank 3 or tools of the trade allow for multiple procs. For example for alchemy, one set of materials is on average provides somewhere around 1.75 products. That's usually why farming the mats may seem like a loss of profit. But even so, you can sell your mats and buy the finished products instead. Nothing stops you from doing that and mats sell quickly.  Make a habit of farming a little bit of mats, sell on reset day or in the weekend and buy your chosen product on monday or whatever day they get low.
---
There are also other reasons why the price may be lower for full items, such as the full item soon become obsolete (which is true for our current flasks. This is the first expansion we've gotten upgraded flasks in a while so many people(goblins) have stocked up on tons of flasks to resell in 8.2. Those are now getting dumped)
---
Like if you just look a little bit deeper into things, there are so many ways even people with less than 50k gold can earn gold without spamcamping the AH. But the difference in BFA from WoD, Legion and whatever is that you dont gain enough to spam pots in m+ and mythic raids by simply doing your daily's and weekly's. 
---
But there's a huge difference between needing to actively look for opportunities to make - or save - gold and your economy being held hostage by goblins.
---
Does anyone have some of the old raid videos people put out? I remember death and taxes put a few out but what about some others?
---
By level 40. You can see the guide here for [yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM) :) 
---
He talks about being able to do the same with rams aswell
---
Not everybody will enjoy classic, doing so does NOT automatically mean thier inferior or a hater.
---
Lol open up all the dungeons at level 30 to raid like Uldaman and RFD.
---
Would be interesting for sure. 
---
40 man ST lol
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, rams and maybe even robotchicken might be possible as human.
---
Some real marketing geniuses came up with this date. Probably the same ones that came up with the tiered streamer beta that doesn't even have enough players to test WSG without massive queue times.
---
?? The top wow streamer is austigold and hes alliance.
---
From a raider's perspective the class design was better (not great but better) and there was some semblance of gear progression and a reward structure that made sense.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also from a PvPer's perspective class design and having a gear vendor is a big positive as well.
---
Yeah that's my second toon after my druid! So iconic.
---
Having a mage defend instead of peeling on roads? I think you wasted your “4 years of pserver experience” mate
---
Damn
---
Man that was lovely to read. I’ve had plenty of similar experiences recently because I started on a private server. Lots of nostalgia and just good fucking gameplay
---
Oh yeah I meant roles rather than a specificed spec. 
---
Warlocks can only DPS
---
Mages can only DPS
---
Hunters can only DPS
---
Rogues can only DPS
---
Shamans's only truly viable competitive role is healing
---
Druids's only truly viable competitive role is healing
---
Paladins's only truly viable competitive role is healing
---
Priest's only truly viable competitive role is healing
---
Warriors are the best Tank and are a top tier DPS as well - So two roles can be occupied efficiently by them unlike any of the other classes
---
Good thing I avoid pvp like I avoid anti-vaxxers out of fear I'll contract their stupidity.
---
That was me for basically the whole of TBC. In Vanilla I didn’t have a 60 main, so I can’t relate 😅
---
That is a true brainlet statement
---
nah
---
So I didn't play original vanilla, so please don't flame me with this question but;  
---
I am interested in playing a rogue maybe with Classic, when playing stress test and private servers, I am finding that  when in stealth, everything/everyone can still see me. Can someone explain how stealth works in Classic for me?  
---
Thank you in advance
---
im only down for paladin warrior if i get to be the warrior
---
They are telling him to reroll (jokingly) because it doesn't matter. It's beta.
---
I would if he didn't live so far away! I'd ask him to play classic with me, but he was very hooked on it and his life improved vastly when he quit and I would never want to undo any of that
---
Wow went downhill in 2001 when they admitted that the game was being designed for casuals , true gamers play EverQuest
---
OG Blizz team knew what the fuck they were doing (for the most part), that's for sure.
---
Very interesting. Where did he get his data?  
---
For example is it possible that Teldrassil has roughly 4.5k to 5k rep instead of the 9,555 rep he mentions?
---
you will destroy everything as an orc hunter in pvp, BGS and world
---
All of your examples are great and amazing game elements.
---
But the stealth walking/running animation isn't a design element.  It was just what happens when they didn't properly animate a specific type of run animation.
---
You think they meant for stealth running to be this weird half walk half slipping on ice?  It doesn't matter that it looks cool.  It isn't a choice they made.  The choice they made was to not care or fix it till later because it was insignificant.
---
You think the fixed animation looks worse, that's a good opinion to have, it's fine mate.  I'm fine if they stick to vanilla roots and give rogues the slip and slide animation again.
---
But it was never intended, it's not a run animation, it was eventually fixed.
---
All that other shit was intended, purposeful, significant.  If Ragnarok looked like a water elemental during one of his attacks by accident and even though WOW HE TURNS BLUE SO COOL.  Then they fixed it so he remained the fire he was supposed to be and you're here claiming OH NO THATS NOT AS COOL MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE WATER AGAIN.
---
The old animation isn't a run animation, it was never intended to look like that, but it did.  Then they fixed it.
---
Humans have definitely changed in the last decade, and community is something of the past. Today the individual rules, which is the natural evolution of society. Community only existed for survival, now that survival is trivial, all that matterts is self-realization / actualization.
---
This is the proper development for a species.
---
Alright someone explain this to me. Why would the queue take longer with more people? Do they only run one game at a time? Wouldn’t having more people allow for faster matchmaking, like how Xbox live shooters work. (Forgive my ignorance, just wondering)
---
&gt; But the real ultimate potential in a successful Classic launch? To take a whole new direction with the game post-Classic.
---
No thanks. I want TBC in 18 months after launch and WotLK 36 months after launch. You can do what you want after that.
---
Not even close i think he sound like a genuinely nice dude i'd have him in my group 100% of the time! :)
---
They used to do the level 60 thing with full tier 2 before a patch during vanilla. Everyone wanted in on the PTR back then to have a fully epic charecter while testing.
---
It's like a when a guy steals your girlfriend, you try to fight him and he beats you up and she runs off in the sunset on his lap
---
I wish i could upvote this 10000 times. It looks awful
---
as someone who's played both WoD and BFA... WoD was clearly better, which really highlights how awful BFA is.
---
Dark Age of Camelot had a horseback transport system, you could jump off whenever. It was ok except you couldn't afk too long because you had to manually jump off when you got close to your destination.
---
It's not something easily inferred without any kind of detail beyond company.
---
Which is funny, because people look back fonder on the end of Mists than they do the beginning of Cata in terms of class design and gameplay.
---
theres no holy resistance bro.
---
The nostalgia wore off years and years ago. It's just genuinely the best game I've ever played in my life and I have been playing it for years on end now without any real breaks.
---
lmao, glad there are people out there who admit this
---
I finally decided on Druid and I’m very excited about it. Gonna support my little heart out.
---
Well you can watch the streams yourself. You can see the flag carrier up on top from way down in the tunnel.
---
what color should i turn my RGB on
---
Your profile checks out. Active in: r/iamapieceofshit
---
When your spec relies too much on engineering to be MINIMALLY decent in PvP it surelly doesn't mean its good at PvP.
---
And I'm not even talking about this clip, but 60 content, be it World PvP or BG's. And if you don't trust me, just ask someone like Savix.
---
Red duh?
---
Lok'tar
---
No
---
Thanks for the idea, I'll make that one next for you.
---
Damn, this dude can sing
---
I think much of the streaming community won't last to 60.
---
Its an old game with fixed content, that naturally makes it hard to make an interesting stream.
---
Theyll do a few city raids and zergs, get the current tier of loot, and then start playing other games
---
Some strange bug with Charge. Not exactly sure what's happening here, maybe it has something to do with line of sight.. idk.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentWonderfulCodFailFish
---
Some people would only play classic.. others will only play retail. I feel there might be a small subset of people who would log into both. Point is I think this would be a net gain for revenue or they wouldn’t be thinking of doing it.
---
Yup, my summer ends the Aug 19th and Fall starts Sept 26th. Perfect timing
---
Yep, clearly visible, no tilt, and also, no "front-tilting" when descending, the current animation is some sort of gliding down straight, while the old one was actually diving
---
I trust that Pantheon will be able to overcome these new age problems (it's kind of the point of that game).
---
Imo the vanilla specs have more class identity, they’re just not balanced well at all so you only see a handful of specs legitimately played.
---
Thank god most streamers are in US. :P
---
Downvotes in ... 3... 2....1
---
This subreddit doesn’t want to hear that.
---
It's a good enough question. Being killed AFK isn't really a decent test. Mage is a very active playstyle that requires active damage mitigation, movement and control. I hope you stuck with your mage.
---
Would it have been right for Blizzard to make Paladin DPS a viable option in Vanilla? Consider the fact that that would have theoretically given the Alliance access to two jack-of-all-trade classes to Horde's one since Shaman tanking was a half-baked concept. Hell, it barely even made it to the oven really.
---
There will always be a huge demand for dungeon tanks. Raid tank slots are few and far between, however.
---
Well Put!
---
I was going to suggest you just pick up a copy because they are cheap on Amazon (I myself bought another copy a few months ago because my old one was missing the AQ and BFD sections) and jeez, their price sky rocketed.  Hope you can find an alternate source or another seller. I'm sorry I don't have any other suggestions :(.
---
So you will be starting the following semester correct?
---
You can play a ret paladin with succes at any level bracket. You are just set in your ways, and it is fine if you believe what you say is true, but it simply isn't. There is much succes to be had in a premade with a ret paladin, and just fyi most people in this game are generally not min-maxing, no life spergs.
---
Oh yeah I sure campaigned for free 110's, titanforging, loss of class sets etc..
---
THANK YOU for bringing this out. I've been trying to lobby for this for years and thought I was the only one.
---
The bug happened about an expansion before, though, in MOP. Check out this 5.1 flight path.
---

#nochangeS
---
Im in the same boat, but as a teacher. This school year was delayed a few weeks so I thought it might line up perfectly and give me some time to play. Nope. Teacher work days starting the 26th.
---
I'll see you on AOL mother fucker.
---
I’m going to play Druid!
---
Well nobody was kept from playing what they want. They were simply delayed by an hour or two when they created their initial character. Once the character was created you were never  kept from selecting or making characters on that server. It was only ment to keep the faction imbalance from being too lopsided
---
Yeah, cast innervate!
---
I've got an overwhelming amount of people saying, Engi&gt;all so that'll be it. Thanks for the advise, guys! Have a good one
---
I believe I heard 20 servers to start.
---
Theres aomething really nice about being on a continent with like 50 different languages lol no-one can really build up a following XD. .... oh shit i just had a thought..... all the russians 🤤 lol i kid love me some ruskies.
---
*Cries in Shaman*
---
Multiboxing is bullshit. It gives people an unfair advantage and the reason it is allowed is because blizzard makes money with iz. Not just pvp but also with farming. Its a huge advantage to multibox. I mean i play on 2 accounts but i dont use a program or anything, but i use the second one to farm and level while i wait for groups, traveling etc.. that gives me a huge advantage over people who dont do it. I would be ok with even that not being allowed. It also looks really out of place and especially on this subreddit where people talk about immersion so much, how immersive is it to see 5 mages named magea mageb magec maged magee following eachother around mimicing everything the guy in the front does? At the very least on RP servers it shouldnt be allowed.
---
This is a dumb complaint. Instead of him slide-stepping, he actually steps the right distance. Still smooth.
---
Yes.
---
They're not so bad in 1.12 but in early Classic they had quite a few drawbacks, not least bear form having only 120% armor bonus at lvl60, and key abilities like innervate and hurricane being locked behind talent trees.
---
No joke, I've been planning my Fall classes out for months and I'm getting the syllabuses from current students now. I'm going to do as much work and studying as I can over the summer to prepare.
---
I'm surprised priest is top 3
---
Only in your first year. After that, teachers just blow through the syllabus in 10 minutes and dive right into the first lesson.
---
With a primary focus on PvP, does it make more sense to roll an Orc Warlock instead of an Undead Warlock? My thought process is that it would serve one better to have some protection (stun resist) from rouges, warriors, and paladins rather than the ability 'Will of the Forsaken' which would help more against other Warlocks and Mages. Since there is a PvP trinket that will help with that and diminishing returns on those abilities, it seems like stuns would be the highest threat.
---
What do you think? Are the Orc shoulders too big to roll a Warlock with?
---
We don't hate, we are saddened that there are people who can't enjoy the good things in life. Just like we don't wish people to suffer from Locked-In syndrome, neither do we want those poor retail players to suffer like they do.
---
Harsh. I think most professors, where I went to school, would've loved to have some students not show up. First day of class was always a damn fire hazard.
---
Hashtag nochanges btw.
---
I thought you weren't able to make an opposite faction character in classic?
---
Yeah but when you're in a serious guild and you're competing with others to top the meters dying can be annoying nonetheless. Especially if you die because of reasons outside your control. Like if the off tank didn't pick up the mob he was supposed to take fast enough.  Or if a random dude blows you up on Geddon or Vael. Basically means you can't compete with those who were lucky enough to keep their world buffs that night.
---
Yup definately was put on Academic probation because of wow
---
-screaming in hunt main-
---
You're going to have to run Ony, Bwl and Mc for months, and be a dedicated and valued player in your guild to be higher in priority for the pieces, otherwise it's going to take longer.
---
Unless you run your own Pugs..
---
I miss when gamers didn’t whine like bitches because they didn’t get in to beta.
---
This seriously needs to be fixed. Why would they even change something like that anyway?
---
Probably something to discuss in 2-3 years..
---
Why is this supposed to be funny?
---
Oh god you do “Edit”s too. Oof.
---
Wow you're one of those people. I bet you also think classes shouldn't be balanced 
---
My favorite class and the one I resonate with is a Balance druid, and I've been told no guilds are going to take me.
---
I'll let you know that I will balance the shit our of raids and be top DPS also. Class balance needs to happen or this circle jerk of a game will die when the next wow expansion drops
---
Yes they were. Also doing the quest gave you the riding skill which is the main reason I did it.
---
Ya and if we let gay men get married then what, dogs?!?!
---
Slippery slope is the biggest logical fallacy of all the logical fallacies. Regardless of if anyone thinks it should be changed or not, this is simply the worst argument and is used by the no-change crowd way too often
---
What’s the best way to level?  A hybrid build with the majority in Holy so dungeon healing is still good enough?
---
Well the thing is at my classes there are people lined out the door trying to add into the course. So an empty desk to the professor makes you look less deserving compared to the people showing up on day 1.
---
It’s going to take months to get a full set. Chances are there will be  2-3 if not more rogues In your group and your fighting with everyone over them. Plus you also have to pray that they even drop.
---
Its something i guess.. but its not really an 'epic' questline like the others are.  Benediction, Rhok'delar, Quel Serrar, lock and paladin mounts, all have a bit more to them, and are a bit more iconic..
---
AIM :(
---
As a casual back then, and a scrub tank who was so bad at the game, I failed at lvl 55+ dungeons, I still had lots of fun and find plenty to achieve once reached 60.  They may not have been game recognized achievements, but enjoyed playing the AH and doing combo's of profitable gathering and crafting to make gold.  Running fellow scrubs in low lvl instances, in my scrub guild.  Making good friends, despite most of us being below average in the game for class.  Going into bg's against and being rolf stomped against a pre-mades.  I really didn't care.  I was carried through some raids due to my attitude, and generosity.  I made having fun and being social my achievements.
---
Pretty sure that's J. Allen Brack's account.
---
Runescape and oldschool runescape have been under the same platform even tho oldschool runescape is way more popular than the current version
---
Minus the two thousand four negative connotation of the word gay.
---
Seriously. This thread is the biggest dick wagging contest. 
---
"Haha this noob doesn't like classic leveling??! He's not a *true* wow player like us. Stick to retail with your flashy buttons, kiddo."
---
First and last time I check this sub, yikes.
---
meanwhile i quit in cata and havent played since but now here i am
---
The fewer Hunters and Rogues I have to compete for gear with the better
---
Yeah, cause having to drink after every mob at level 58 def did make me feel stronger than level 1...
---
Also you are missing the point (like everybody here almost it seems) RPG elements that make your char grow and progress along the way? Everybody will love it. Does that mean the first [x] amount of levels have to be boring? NO. "weak" ingame doesnt mean the gameplay should be boring. It can"t be that hard to grasp for people right?
---
This is a conservation project, not a re-imagining of how Classic should have been.
---
Hmm let me see who's most important:
---
A) A random guy 
---
B) A random guy + hundreds if not thousands of people watching the guy.
---
Lemme think real hard about this one.
---
That's my trick, I have no need to be in a serious guild because vanilla content is old and there's no point in tryharding it
---
"Ret paladin is a joke in pve."  
---
like, in a good way or in a bad way ?
---
Having multiple servers means that blizzard has a chance to do multiple different things after Classic. But one of those things is definitely going to be burning Crusade.
---
I'm pretty sure the spell batching in classic is more delayed than it should be.
---
Why use an old guide people have been making new more detailed guides online for years...
---
there are 4-6 per guild you will be good.
---
What made the Gryphons mad? Not enough hay in their beds?
---
I've seen far to many people who roll Warrior thinking they are a DPS only.
---
Shitty warrior's will be dime a dozen, but not all of them will be able to tank, even when it comes to 5 mans.
---
Well BFA has been pretty well regarded as a failure. Vanilla was very popular originally, so I would say WoW Classic has a better chance of maintaining interest
---
Just Like the good old PvP Videos Witz Windows movie maker^^
---
It is more efficient... if you want to play with friends
---
See that's why private servers just aren't worth the investment of time (at least for me) it's not a matter of if they will get shut down but when.
---
I know this isn’t about server names, but Echo isles was my shitty server back in the day. a lot of good memories.
---
First tip, try to banish the idea of thinking in terms of a server being dead. Service will never have zero players. And you can't predict how any arbitrary number of players is going to make you feel. If you have friends on a server it feels full. You have to make friends in order to have friends. You have to join a server in order to make friends.
---
Or you can get involved with the community now, make friends now, plan to join the same server together. Communities don't just poof into existence, they are built with thoughtful hard work
---
That video is outdated and based on private server information.
---
You get a lot less rep in beta. you're not going to be hitting exalted by 40.
---
Sad to see Pally at the bottom. I hope more people give them a try. Slow, steady with enough utility and tricks to handle most any situation. I'm looking at them again now, I'm older, I'm not hyped up on caffeine like I used to be and I don't really crave a high (Well, high for WoW) APM class to play that does big damage and show-off-y tricks. It'll be nice to have a reliable leveller and always be a boon to a group, salvation truly is a blessing.
---
Not in these comments it isn't.
---
Really?? You seem bothered.
---
Now hear me out: Bald eagles are old hat. People like them and all, but we want new and improved bald eagles! So instead of setting up conservation ranges for them, how about we genetically manipulate them into having *red* feathers?! That'll definitely keep public interest in them. Brown bald eagles have been around forever. They're boring, okay? Deal with it.
---
Tedious =\= difficult. Try again.
---
Why? BFA still has 4:3 loading screens.
---
Shadow is good enough for dungeon healing!
---
The jerkiness makes sense when you're running. If you're trying to be sneaky, it makes sense to keep your movement limited and "glide" (not literally) across the ground.
---
It doesn't launch for another 3 months, how can you be late to the party?
---
So any way to seek out decent guild pre release haha? I plan to grind out 60 hard/book off a week of work so I will be gold farming afterwards for BIS pre raid. Hopefully I will have what I need to be competitive in raids by the time groups start doing the content.
---
Love the soundtrack
---
All the better for those of us that know how to play the whole part of the class.
---
A warrior that can't tank shouldn't be able to get gear.
---
God knows I'm not going to pull shitty "rogues in plate" through 5 mans to steal my BiS
---
It was in the Cata pre patch. They added old world flying and master flying.
---
I can let you know later tonight.
---
It is more a theoritical but now ive realised i live in europe and most if streamers are us based. So fuck it, they're your problem. Have fun with the streamers and the chinese ;) itll be pubg all over again =)
---
Orc is really the only choice for Warlocks. Stun resist is key in PvP and 5% pet damage comes out ahead in PvE.
---
yes lv30 wsg is completely shit, i don't think that comes as a surprise to many.
---
The problem is that almost of the original developers of the game are gone from the WoW design team. Trusting Blizzard to learn from the game and truly implement new content that goes within the Vanilla mindset is something that is probably not going to be heavily supported, as people have seen what they have done to retail wow.
---
Good thing i live in australia but thanks for assuming im american :)))
---
I can't believe people are arguing about which ones looks better. The point is, it doesn't matter. The first one is vanilla, the second one isn't. They should absolutely fix this.
---
think about the 2x4 technique with pullers / killers in Bfa. You can adapt it to classic , but instead of grinding a static spot you use an addon to make an optimized route with perfect respawns. Boosted character has to be a class with at least one fast and spammable long range spell or weapon. But i'm still unsure if they'll keep the mob tagging in release
---
What if my staff is mushy and doglegs sharply to the left?
---
You.. I like you!
---
&gt; I bet you also think classes shouldn't be balanced 
---
Yeah, most people think the classes shouldn't be balanced. They are recreating vanilla wow, not your vision of what vanilla should be.
---
Do you have au servers? Thats awesome for you if they do. Sorry i thought they only had chinese, eu and us servers
---
I'll accept Tirisfal Glades to Nagrand. Making it across Barrens as a level 1 is a challenge worthy of mentioning.
---
Have you never looked at the tabs down the bottom when you click change server? We've had them since wotlk if not tbc
---
I used to have hesitancy on big shoulders.  But honestly, it looks super cool on an orc.  This is subjective, of course, but I think it’s tied for looking good with the undead.
---
Wildstar was awesome from what I’ve heard, I wish I had gotten a chance to play. However, I do remember seeing it and thinking “meh, I don’t want another WoW clone.” And also being uninterested in their aesthetic. Up until about 2015-2016 Classic Style MMO’s were pretty easy to come by and WoW was better. Now WoW sucks, and there are no classic, non-p2w mmo’s being developed. WoW isn’t an MMORPG anymore, so the hill has gone empty on an entire industry product segment. 
---
I think Classic will fill that void for a lot of high school gamers who want to experience nostalgia and the style of gaming they grew up on.
---
By the time you finally clear the raid it always seems to like half the raid-squad is incompetent
---
&gt; I'll accept Tirisfal Glades to Nagrand
---
Uhh...
---
&gt;Nagrand
---
What?
---
It really doesn't matter. The new animation is not from vanilla.
---
Blizzard quite literally said they'd be open to Classic TBC; my argument is literally the same that we used to get Classic WoW.
---
Classic WoW took this long because of those exact arguments.
---
Thanks everyone for your comments ! so  got the concept pretty much, the heal-only paladin is at lv 60/raiding, from 1-59, i can do pretty much whatever spec i want.  
---
And with the slow paced combat, i guess i will have no problem at doing some dps on dungeons.  
---
One last question. From what i heard, since healer paladins are int, a lots of time i will benefit from cloth armor. Is the gear really spec centered at the time of leveling ? i mean, if i want to heal, will i have to wear cloth-int armor, instead of mail strenght one ? or i will pretty much heal/tank/damage with the same gear with few exceptions, like warriors for example, who pretty much tank or do damage with the same gear.
---
Hold on, from what I understand you're comparing a 60 stealth mechanic to a level 1 stealth mechanic. Honestly I don't know what your specs are like. And from what I understand the higher-level you went on the ability you got an increase in speed and a decrease in detection range. 
---
I know you're solely comparing the animation. But back when I was playing vanilla the mechanic changed the higher level you got everything seemed a bit smoother. Nothing really seems any different. I always remember the lower level animations looking like shit, but once I talented for master of deception and got my higher level tiers of stealth everything smooth out.
---
I never claimed otherwise. :)
---
I found the guy that doesn’t maximize dps by spamming his keys
---
Not really. I checked the battle net drop down for things like overwatch but it only shows me eu and us i think. In eu because of all the different languages those tabs used to be dedicated to language specific servers but pretty much everyone played english speaking servers.
---
Love it. By chance has anyone done this and gotten to exalted with orgrimmar by level 40? Curious how feasible that is
---
Yeah, they put us on "us" for the launcher but once you actually launch any of their games you can generally pick oce, they have an office in sydney.
---
Kevin Jordan, one of the principal Vanilla designers, also streams on Twitch and I'll always remember an example he gave, it went something like this:
---
&gt; “Lets say metrics tell us that Paladins are refusing to do Sunken Temple because it turns out there's nothing worth it for them there. What do you do? Do you consider that as an organic outcome of a naturally divergent world, or do you see it as a problem to be fixed?
---
&gt; Lets say they decide to incentivize Paladins by adding a drop just for them. Sure, now Paladins start running ST, but that item is going disrupt a carefully balanced item flow. If a blacksmith made a comparable item, now they're disincentivized from making it. There are huge ramifications to ‘shoring up’ content. By trying to patch every hole you've ended up destroying the original flow.”
---
Oh, I didn’t know that would be different. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
Is this guide [https://youtu.be/exh-niEWk-E] outdated aswell then?
---
Ooooo me too!! 
---
To be fair I quit the first time during Cata. Quit again MOP. Hubby got me WoD for Xmas and I played for like a week before quitting again. 
---
I’m so excited for classic I’m about half a step away from getting one month on retail just to mess around.
---
[This one is catchy AF :))](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvvYhBaGEi8)
---
Sorry instead of mechanic I meant animation
---
Here, found the reason why I wasn't sure!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHf-ry4grSM
---
Footage from March 2012, which means something like the beta of MoP? So you might be right with 5.1, I'll try reading the patch notes
---
Actually interesting question. Apparently it was there for most of vanilla but was taken out in 1.10 for unknown reasons like you said. Interesting. I feel like if they added it, it wouldnt be nochanges but at the same time its the 1.12 patch/client even though blizz will be phasing out the content plan...hmmm....
---
I agree, but sometimes a 60 camping a lowbie can lead to huge world pvp moments. One lowbie gets killed a few too many times, so he calls his guildies, then the camper calls their guildies, and before you know it there's dozens of corpses and players duking it out for hours.
---
Part of reason I'm going Druid. I like tanking dungeons, and they're decent at it.
---
Your complaining about level 30 people doing BGs and using abilities they unlocked at level 30?
---
Ah fair enoughs well im happy for you all then.
---
Loginqueue, not bg
---
Iv mained prot pally from BC - WOD, Ret in legion. Ran an Ehn Shaman as an alt. Tanking is my favorite position, and i have never tried my hand at healing. With that im trying to talk myself into staying away from a plate wearing tank and do something completely different i have never done, even though prot Warrior is  still an open option for me in my book. My other option is running a priest. Im honestly just worried ill stink at being a healer and dont want to disappoint lol.  I cant decide.
---
Definitely can
---
Who said anything about changes?
---
Double pally number though, because horde dont roll them.
---
RemindMe! 93 days
---
missing the unregistered hypercam 2
---
&gt;I felt like I did half the damage that other classes with double the effort no matter the spec or gear.
---
That's everything about a Druid.  Half the tanking, half the heals, double the effort.
---
That's the reason they aren't played.
---
And hunters
---
Maybe if your job requires brain activity or something but when I worked 10 hours a day at a job where I didn't have to think it felt really good to come home and play video games
---
I would want more raids, not with better gear than naxx, but different gear. Maybe some different sets, sets that help hybrids more. Just more raiding content in general. Maybe stuff not quite as good as the tiers, but still really good and different.
---
The hybrids have good talent trees, pretty similar to tbc, but the gear isn't really there to support them.
---
I dug through the patch notes and couldn't find much about flight paths except this:
---
"The Guild Perk, Ride Like the Wind, should now properly increase flight path speeds by 25% in Pandaria."
---
I'll keep digging on later patches
---
I've only been duelist a few times back in BC because my partner refused to grind enough gear to play that high, so I have a bit of competitive pvp experience. That said, some of the most fun I've had is just getting a few buddies, getting drunk as hell, and rampaging STV/Tanaris.
---
Don't worry school will always be there.
---
i started in MoP, miss that shit homie.
---
they've gutted and straight up made retail into a weird zoo-like game.
---
hyped for classic!
---
It will take a long time of weekly raiding considering you'll likely raid with 4-6 rogues per raid and bosses drop 2-3 set items for the entire raid. So that's on average 1-2 pieces of bloodfang every week once you clear MC/BWL and Onyxia on a weekly basis.
---
Bag space limitations are a huge part of the game. Main reason why consumables only stack to 5.
---
In the grand scheme of things, needing 1 or 2 bags for soul shards is not that bad. Druid tanks need at least 3 bags filled with different sets of gear and reagants. Warrior off-tanks are similar (minus the reagants).
---
No, im talking about questionable game design where half of the builds/classes are flat out useless or highly inferior to the top class builds. 10% damage difference in BFA between classes? Get your pitch forks! Litterly doing double the dps as rogue compared to low performers in classic? That"s just good flavourfull game design, looking forward to it. *Rolls rogue.
---
Bring 10 turtles to the water? Not this repetative BS again! But meanwhile let me grind 4 hooves on classic for 2 hours and call it engaging.
---
Account sharing / win trading to reach rank 14 in pvp? Good design. Those people were just so dedicated that they had to cheat to get it.
---
Spirit on everything? Hell fucking yes.
---
Haha this gave me a good laugh. Gl topping dps as a boomer in a even half serious raiding guild
---
I'll probably play on 2 diff servers one for the glory of the horde and one for the meh alliance
---
I really hope Druids, Paladins, Shamans, amd priests aren't forced to just be healers in this new Classic. Sure they were sub pair compared to Warrior tanks, and pure dps classes, but most players in the 40 man teams were sub par players or flat out AFK anyways.
---
You will be wearing a dress
---
regardless it will be known which servers they are on and that information will get out before launch
---
Going Druid. Not sure Horde or Alliance though. 
---
Druid because: can tank dungeons which I enjoy and is fun imo. 
---
Good at levelling. 
---
Lots of quality of life. Teleport moonglade, stealth, heals and so on.
---
Can buff strangers which feels nice.
---
Not as reliant on engineering, so feel safe to take herb alch which incidentally is great as it works in animal forms. Also no need for tailoring for bis recipes like clothies. 
---
I'm a wpvp carebear and druid is great at avoiding conflict and escape. 
---
Can farm decently well even with healer spec and gear at max level.
---
Definitely Rogue by far. 
---
Warrior would be up there too.
---
Well yeah that's just a fun way to get organised with friends. Unless you're particularly attached to being LegolasPikachu though it won't control what server people roll on.
---
Deepfrost mage can do decent aswell
---
Any healer as well.
---
Check out Stormx on YouTube. Druids are insane.
---
Well it works in BFA with Warlock and Hunter pets so I don't see why it wouldn't in Classic.
---
Yeah. Not saying it's not fun to occasionally world pvp, but it doesn't interest me to grind ranks. And yeah I feel you haha I was never fully geared when I did arena.
---
:(
---
I was our guild's MT all through vanilla and I wanna do it all over again!
---
I only kill people that have a chance to kill me. So if I'm 60 maybe 55+ depending on how well I'm geared.
---
....Shaman? You don't even need to kill a Shaman. Just cast Curse of Tongues and tab to a different target because he's going to be useless for the next 30 seconds.
---
I agree. The same mentality was kept with OldSchoolRunescape. A comprise was reached where community feedback was used top drive updates. I trust passionate devs like Omar to keep the feel of Classic.
---
Do we as a community really hate arena, class balance, new raids? I'm hyped for classic and I think it will easily pass the population of BFA. But classic will feel fresh for a year, it will feel fresh for 2 years.. Then once major guilds have Naxx on farm then what? Pvp will feel the same always... The good classes will always be good, the bad classes will always be bad.. No meta shift ever. 1 meta can only feel fresh for so long.
---
Games like League of Legends and Dota have such an active playerbase despite having the same game, same graphics.. for a decade. Why? There's balance patches that bring in new metas, new theorycrafting, new item builds. Classic can do the same thing!
---
I noticed something while watching the streamers. There’s a huge sense of community that classic had that was lost sometime after BC. As much as I adored WOTLK for the gameplay aspect, the community feel was gone by then. 
---
Man, it was nothing to just group with random folks going the same way to try and finish quests. To get help from others in the zone against a ganker. When I played Cata And even WOTLK like I said above, the community was long gone, everyone was off doing their own thing. and god help you if you weren’t already well-versed in something! 
---
Wow classic was a game where you really could solo but the community was really still there. I’m anxious to see all of you again. I’m anxious to escape from “hurry up and level n00b, why aren’t you maxed out yet?!” that I felt when I quit.
---
Keep in mind layering will exist, so queue times will not really be a thing, and even then if you were on, say, Soda's or Asmon's server, you might be in another layer anyway so those groups and mobs will sometimes not even exist in your world.
---
This community here is actually a bunch of shitter elitist spergs and the sub runs like a slighty less racist public Discord channel.
---
Doesnt the intro cinematic say tirisfal outloud? &gt;_&gt;
---
Dancing rune weapon nerf killed it. 
---
You just used full runic power. Popped drw and cast bloodstrike lile 4 times and everything near you was dead lol 
---
I miss that and the corpse explosion that could proc more corpse explosions.
---
It was really refreshing after how boring heroics were in Wrath. Those dungeons really taught me how to tank and how to play better in general.
---
tldr;
---
Carry my ass guys, I will take the loot though :)
---
sorry man youre going to have to deal with it and its literally a second or two of loading
---
what if you enjoy playing regardless of lockouts and honor?
---
Just stating that in Vanilla the bracket ended at 29. Druid Travel form wasn't available and vs any other classes extra talent or spell, was extremely OP vs other 30's.
---
If this was 39 then it'd be fine, more slows and stuns and control options are available to all other classes.
---
yaaaaaaa youre wrong
---
How can I try a private server?
---
I have 1200 hours played and have killed uber elder, somehow I don't think that's it. 
---
More like there hasn't been a decent league since breach.
---
It’s the bottom of the next bracket. It has nothing to do with the 29 bracket.
---
Should we tell him where wow is made?
---
I remember trying to get my friend who got me into the game and was already like level 25 to explain to me what battlegrounds were. It was a concept I just couldn’t grasp as a lowbie leveling in elwynn, it blew my mind
---
Can you enchant items like the arcanite reaper without removing their chance hit special?
---
Oh look it's th-th-th-this thread again
---
Yes - it’s the perfect time to jump in as a new player.  Everybody will be starting at level 1 with you so the game will actually feel like an MMO.
---
Yeah leveling in BfA was absolutely sweet I thought. But the rest of it. Yikes.
---
You can definitely guilds that just have fun and let not so great specs play. The only problem is you need to play well and still might not perform as well as good specs with bad players.
---
Druid off tanks really are good, but raids don't need multiple. Ret brings unique buffs and does ok dps. If they pay attention they can save a raid with lay on hands. Shadow priests, maybe just 1, are usually brought along for their shadow debuff.
---
Enhancement shamans don't really bring much that resto can't do and does the worst dps out of all these, so they're in a tough spot.
---
What if she changed her mind after 4 years and decides she's not ok with you having hookers, opiates and alcholism as hobbies and though she was at first?  
---
    
---
This reddit meme that there is a clear and obvious moral compass in relationships is hilarious to me.
---
That assumes the hybrid players aren’t equally subpar, which won’t be the case.
---
31/20 holy paladin as always.  Best class in classic
---
Are you forgetting layering will be a thing? And if you're European then why even bitch?
---
100% YES!
---
I didnt reach max level for the first time until tbc. I love horde leveling love the barrens and trsifal, but I've done it so much I need to try something new.
---
He said “they won’t”, based on no evidence or information. Not “they don’t” based on a beta. Have a little faith; what’s with the knee jerk negativity?
---
I’m not looking forward to fighting tooth and nail for the flask recipes even though I’ll be an actual Alchemist and I want them so bad ;_;
---
Yea, exactly! And the gear can even be polled. Different gear that's better in different circumstances that allows us to theorycraft all over again. That was half the fun in Classic... Experimentation.
---
And minor buffs or nerfs to keep the meta fresh and changing. Does increasing Starfire damage by 10% really take away the "classic experience"? No, now you just have druids feel like they might be able to compete for a patch as non resto and theorycraft item builds that maximizes arcane damage (just an example).
---
I mean... to be fair, IT IS classic wow subreddit.
---
Classic.wowhead.com 
---
There are actually a bunch, just google it and you’ll find plenty of options.
---
So you are telling us that an exploit isn't working and demanding to fix it? 
---
Did you watch other battleground matches on beta? Do you want to be feared through the wall in flag room or look helplessly at enemy flag carrier who climbed to the top of alliance building?
---
Your "amazing" tip gives potential for uneven battleground matches.
---
In a bad way. That being said play whatever you enjoy playing.
---
It surprised me when I played in a private server recently how many warriors tried to join dungeon groups as DPS.  When I played in vanilla and BC no one would let a warrior DPS in a dungeon .
---
I understand that. But it's only one level after 29. I don't think you understand what I'm complaining about. It's not a big deal but it does ruin the true experience of the bracket in Vanilla. Travel Form &gt; Any other spell or Talent anyone else gets at 30 by a Large margin.
---
Anyway, I'm not trying to argue about it. Just feel bad watching fellow rogues have no way of stopping the FC.
---
This is like the 5-6th thing in the last few days that's come up that they've ignored.
---
If they change it that's awesome, but I doubt they will.. With the whole character model thing, they pretty much just said "Nah, we're right. Even though none of you can test it, just trust us k".. even though every screenshot posted here shows a size difference. 
---
Same with the flying mount thing too, they didn't even add the flying animations, and apparently they aren't changing it.
---
it's not that unpopular. i wouldn't mind it. 
---
but then again, i also want barber shop and people will probably crucify me for that.
---
I don't trust the community to not ruin it. Have you read some of the posts on here?
---
Where my druids at?!
---
It doesn't really matter if Warlocks are weaker than Mages (they are). Warlocks are much rarer, especially on Alliance. You will find raid slots more easily as a Warlock than a Mage.
---
If you like Warlocks, then play a Warlock.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you've never played before, I suggest you try retail, dont buy the game or anything, it's free to lvl 20. 
---
New accounts don't have heirlooms &amp; enchants to one shot everything, it will feel somewhat close to classic. 
---
Keep in mind though, in classic, leveling will be waaaay slower and you won't have all the cool skills you had on retail. Also monsters will be harder to kill.
---
Basically, try retail and decide if you'd enjoy doing the same thing but slower.
---
quit after cata realise, delete character, sent to blizzard angry email.
---
The 20-29 bracket still exists... you’re seeing the 30-39 bracket, only the max level is 30.  
---
Really, what’s the point in even complaining about this? It’s a unique situation that’ll never happen again after beta is finished.
---
Rouge
---
Full circle aka we went from Anduin to Varian to Anduin, and then Anduin again?
---
They would have a better chance at re-starting with Classic and releasing a new expansion without flying, group finder, cash shop, horde+alliance capitals, etc.
---
The "World" in WoW is dead. They have sold all of the best looking mounts so nothing means anything. It used to be if someone had something cool looking, they did something or were really lucky. They would have to start fresh and undo bad design decisions.
---
Forest Leather Belt. +4 strength, +4 stamina uhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhuhhhhhhhh
---
Or we can make a thread for people who actually like bfa and they can discuss it there, since the majority of people dislike bfa. There’s no reason to not bash a garbage expansion for a game we’ve loved for over a decade and have poured countless hours into.
---
Lol
---
Armorsmithing would be the best thing for your guild, having someone who can craft lionheart helm and all the resistance sets is an amazing asset for the guild. That being said, usually tanks roll armor smithing cuz they have it already have it planned out that they will need the gear, but, you can also free up that burden. I also read in one of your posts that you didn't want to go engineering but I highly suggest it as a prot paladin, the shield you get from it is insane for speedruning 5 man's and is also the best thing you can get if you're having threat problems. Also having engineering in pvp gives a big edge against those who don't have it.
---
Lol the post you’re referring too was fake.
---
LegolasPikachu sounds cool, gonna consider reserving that here and there
---
I get where you were coming from, if they had a do over maybe they would have made the beta stop at 29 knowing they were going to test WSG.  But its not really a big deal this stuff is all irrelevant in a couple months.
---
I remember getting my embertsone stone staff out of deadmines like it happened yesterday.
---
girls i swipe and girls who swipe me
---
Only time I ever got taken on a raid as enhancement was when I was in a guild ran by a very close irl friend. It’s a goddamn blast to level, but super unpopular in raids.
---
I played a ret paladin extensively in vanilla in a top tier raiding guilds and even then I had to play holy about 75% of the time and fight for dps loot and the occasional raid spots for ret. it’s just not worth the frustration. it’s a bad spec (pve wise) and not worth the fight and time investment to get high end dps gear. Then you look at prot which does not exist period in raid environments. Most sane people aren’t going to play a paladin unless they are okay with healing in raids or are in a position of power in their raid group and know they will be allowed to play the “bad” specs.
---
There it is. Thank you!
---
All aboard the ruse cruise
---
Alliance Warlocks are probably the most needed class in raids, while Horde Hunters are the least. Have fun sitting on the bench as a Horde Hunter while the Alliance Warlocks get their full tier set in 2 weeks.
---
Holy Paladin all the way!
---
SMH layering is not the answer
---
For Great Justice!
---
Created a character and logged in.  All his gear was white.  Nothing orange or even purple.  Shit game.  Why would I want to play as some fucking scrub character?
---
Taliesin plays priest when hes on. Though I'm not sure how much he steams.

Why does it really piss you off? Tbh i like the fact its put WoW back in spotlight.  Yea it sucks to not get to play beta, but not really.
---
You honestly believe they’ll be able to keep this a secret for more than 30 seconds tops?  It’s as easy as a /who...
---
Maybe if you’re a freshman. In my upper bio classes we’d do syllabus and then start right into notes/intro material after going through it.
---
I’d disagree with how much more frequently real life is implicated in internet drama.
---
Pupils also dilate upon the release of adrenaline from the fight or flight response. It’s quite possible she’s thinking of flight.

Jesus drama queen christ.  They're entertainers doing a job, stop crying like an infant.
---
I'm super bitter about my duelist title in TBC. Me and my friend got to the rating that would have gotten us Gladiator (we didn't know then) as Warlock/Warlock. Then we faced a shitton of Warrior/Druid with Skill Herald and the rating tanked....
---
I’m currently having a bit of a dilemma, I like shaman healing but do I really want to heal the entirety of classic?
---
Shamans can do other stuff but i’m worried that I’m going to be gimped in WvW/pvp.
---
&gt; only has certain metas that work
---
I'd say most class/race selections work, being able to use what you are given is probably the most important skill in the game, even at the top level there are probably 8-10 end game compositions that are competitive. 
---
You will lose and/or not place top 4 in most your games starting off but it gets easier after you get past the first hill in the learning curve. 
---
&gt;most people are waiting for that to not waste time with progress that doesn't go over.
---
I haven't really heard this from anyone who is actively playing autochess. You get FOTM players in every game, I'm waiting for the new game but I'm not going to stop playing autochess in the meantime.
---
I feel like you should be doing a duet with Archie Bunker about the superiority of the Vanilla playerbase
---
What is layering?
---
Roots not working indoors sucks. Having a bunch of talents, abilities, and even set bonuses all not work indoors is just miserable. 
---
I feel like the class is either a bit weak or too hard for me to play. Shape shifting is like stance dancing but on hard mode.
---
😂😂
---
Yeah some of us don’t leech of others.
---
Few streamers, low ping, normal raiding hours for Pacific region people. Oceanic servers are quite tempting.
---
Prot Pvp? Do tell.
---
I played a ret paladin extensively in vanilla in top tier raiding guilds and even then I had to play holy about 75% of the time and fight for dps loot and the occasional raid spots for ret. it’s just not worth the frustration for me to want to play it again knowing what I know now. I had fun dueling and pvping as ret but it is a terrible spec pve wise and not worth the fight and time investment to get high end dps gear. Protection might as well not exist outside of pvp gimmicks for fun. Most sane people aren’t going to play a paladin unless they want to be a healer in raids or are in a position of power in their raid group and know they will be allowed to play the “bad” specs.
---
Yeah. Knowing there was a huge amount of content being explored by some people, but not me, made the world seem so huge and scary
---
War fronts. Lawl. Raids were rinse and repeat it seemed like. Super boring. I only made it to like the 7th or 8th boss in the first raid. 
---
Zone art was incredible. I loved the quests and the storylines. At least horde. I thought alliance was a little lackluster. 
---
Shitty art design for gear though honestly. Idk it had the most potential of any expansion IMO and they fucked it up hard.
---
Ou that's a really nice analogy.. Here, let me try!
---
Now hear me out: VHS tapes are old right. They're fun.. They look cool.. I love using my hands to manually rewind them.. What a Classic experience! I cry tears of joy everytime!
---
But wait, VHS tapes didn't do Rihanna music.. She wasn't big then! I don't care if I like VHS tapes for the VHS experience, I also want the exact same song from the 90s playing on repeat for the next couple years. That'll bring me back to the good old days and keep me interested for years to come! Naw, don't add any new songs for VHS or even improve the existing sound quality for the songs to what we have now... I want the good old raspy feeling for life!
---
You want newer music to keep things fresh? Go use Spotify! You're not wanted in this sub.

play runescape classic and eq tlp first
---
Ah yes, the White Lady, and the Blue child.  I remember them fondly.

That’s when you say fuck it and spirit Rez and go somewhere else. Just part of them game bother
---
The subreddit has nothing to do with BFA. Why should we make a thread for people who like it? It's kind of a given that people here don't. There's a great subreddit where people pretty much constantly bash BFA... it's /r/wow lol. 
---
I don't see the constant stream of posts about BFA serving much purpose here beyond making people look like they're insecure and petty lol.
---
With T2 and a equivalent weapon, hell yeah. They just don't die
---
I’ve got the atlas around somewhere.
---
when i did my poll i had options for roles, there wasn't many votes because i posted it during aus times but there was more tanks than dps warrs https://strawpoll.com/bbd4zcc1
---
Same. Quit 2 - 3 months ago. Can't make any gold in BFA and it's not fun anymore. Hoping Classic is.
---
It's just fun to read. Lots of pictures, graphs, tips, lore for everything, maps, detailed spawns, stats on everything at a glance. It's just neat little books.
---
Sorry, but no.   Look at all of it more carefully.
---
Have you though of pagination for your write-ups? I think it would make navigating/digesting the content a lot easier.
---
Like others said, any healer is great in pvp. Frost mages are great. The lock like you mentioned.
---
How much pvp you going to get camping lowbies lol
---
When you opponents throw away their cs for no reason it does get a lot easier.
---
Were you replying to another comment or something? My response was on point (I care, but don't need to see it every time). Yours has nothing to do with my post.
---
There's really no way out in this subreddit, there's 2 opposite communities in here and it shows. People downvote any kind of comments even the ones that show facts. Seems like the only kind of comments that get upvoted are the ones filled with nostalgia and memes.
---
They clearly just need to make it so that there are no run animations, just walk animations that slide around. You know what? Fuck it. Just have them stand still and slide around. I'm sure that's how the game existed at one point before it released so that's the purest form, right?
---
I checked the current client and the default value is already 3 :)
---
Ya, i just hope guilds start focusing on the player and not the class. A shadow priest that fights is better then a mage who afks for the first 5 bosses of MC.
---
Per raid*
---
Actually they said they will get rid of layering before implementing phase 2 because of world bosses which could be exploited.

Literally every screen
---
Really? Starting with Black Fathom Deeps you can solo Baron Aquinas for the Outlaw Sabre quest reward. The rare spawn from Mara for his chest piece, the bartender in BRD, Lethendris in DM East etc.
---
Just go wand talents and rest in Shadow and you're good to go. Blizzard intentionally overscaled healing spells while leveling so that anyone could heal no matter what as long as they had the latest ranks.
---
when people shit on ret/boomy/ele, they aren't talking about pvp, they are talking about pve. the issue with this however is that to get geared and not usually be a drag for your raid, because you kinda have to pve to get pvp gear at the start, you have to heal, or come in pulling half the dps of the norm.
---
This was me. Never came back. Might play Classic for nostalgias sake. I was hoping they took Classic and made WoW 2.0 in a different direction
---
You are missing the point of Classic.
---
If I want to go play an old retro game that I loved like Super mario 64 or Pokemon Yellow I can do it. But if I want to play Vanilla WoW I can't, it doesn't exist anymore.
---
Thank you for the insight. The only thing I'm worried about while playing a warlock is threat. It sounds disheartening to know you have to limit dps bc of high threat, especially since I plan on playing horde.
---
It's basically impossible to make any informed decisions as there is no way to predict what server is going to be successful.
---
Your best bet is to pick a server in your timezone and just play the game.  
---
My friends and I are going to wait for the server list to come out and pick a name we like. If server lists don't come out beforehand, we're going to roll on Xth server alphabetically (agreed upon beforehand) in our timezone.
---
Wrath heroics should never have been released in the state they were... that was the point I was let down in the game. Had pretty much our best gear end of December and compared to BC just wow.

---
Show it to people like this guy you replied to if ya want.
---
Just because they're re-releasing the game doesn't mean they have to make it look like ass.
---
&gt; The point is that everyone has their own idea of what changes they would like in Classic. If Blizzard changes something, the community will be split - some will like it, others wont.
---
Who cares? Unless they actually unsubscribe over it, they can be "split" all they like. Heck, people are "split" over existing design decisions. It is not the end of the world.
---
To me a good raider is someone who shows up early, shows up well prepared and is able to take some god damn critique without making up a ton of excuses.
---
WoW subscription numbers are a very important part of the earnings call for ATVI. Revenue can be flat but if the subs are going up the shareholders will be happy. 
---
I wonder how many extra subs they got this quarter just from people trying to get into the beta?
---
(They don't)
---
That's so old, i felt young again for a minute, thanks

The makeup expert
---
MC will be to easy to force people to stash out in full prebis raid gear. Just prework the first raid phase gear
---
I agree with that. But it's fun currently because zones are brimming with players and it feels like an MMO.
---
A year or two in, most content will be on farm. Existing players won't create new characters because there's like 3 viable classes. New players won't play because low level zones are now empty and they're so far behind the crowd anyway.. Why bother?
---
You can't control people feeling like they're behind the population. What you can control is getting existing players to try other classes because there's new items to theorycraft some random build or some obscure spec is now viable. This will atleast keep low level zones populated with people wanting to try new things a year down.

I'm glad you finally understand what's so great about Classic WoW. Good for you! But really, the proper tech to reference would be vinyl records. VHS is for videos, of course; people don't really use them for music.

People naturally stop hanging out in Stormwind after they're done with STV around level 39-41.
---
Yup I plan on just cruising to 60. If it takes me a month then thats exactly how long it will take. Fuck this binging shit at launch crap.
---
Only to start with ie: phase 1. I only realised it was a us problem after someone mentioned it in the comments.
---
Stealth movement speed penalty decreases as you get more ranks so it becomes smoother.
---
Idk man, that definitely party of the vanilla experience lol.
---
Whoa there buddy, that makes sense. Stop that.
---
These circlejerkers only want models where they can count the polygons and animations where they can count the frames because they don't understand aesthetic appeal.

/#No Changes
---
Same could be said for the classic fans who constantly screech and moan about retail. Both sides are full of douchebags just ignore them and move on.
---
I'd love to have some friends to play when Classic comes out. But sadly they are all playing retail/quitting WoW for good.
---
Plus you also have to wait for BWL release. I'll say, you've got a fair chance at the helm at least. Just keep running Onyxia.
---
played theough it all ...... we shall see bliZ we shall see
---
Druids are niche as fuck. Either heal in pve or stick to group PVP. Otherwise, you arent as effective as other classes.
---
It's wrong, look at what I just posted if you want proof.
---
Also the griffon thing was posted 12 hours ago, how fast do you expect them to fix or respond to things?
---
No, hes saying we (retail) have come full circle. Anduin to Varian back to Anduin again.
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
I might switch to engineering after I’ve used mining for a while to farm up mats. 
---
I did really love engineering in retail, it could be fun to get back to it. I’ve got a few friends who will just be going with pure gathering professions, so I may leech off them.
---
Reminder that Martin Falch edited almost all of this himself, throughout months of work.
---
There is *so* much love poured into this. Obviously it's got impressively animated and choreographed Anime-style action, but the detail is what impresses me. Every time characters who wear armor move, you hear it rattling or moving against each part. On top of that you've got a ton of small lore bits and character quirks, like the Lich King complimenting Blazer on hurting himself to hurt the Lich King, or stuff like Al'Akir and Brox being referenced.
---
These videos are absolutely ahead of their time and are something I watch every now and then. They're true works of dedication and love for this franchise, and show a fun self insert story of a character beating up the Lich King.
---
Is it over the top and a crazy power fantasy? Sure, but most gamers enjoy over the top action so it suits Warcraft just fine.
---
The storytelling and Voice lines are also well delivered, the music while at times a bit questionable is well chosen (Using Naruto OST only reminds me of sarcastic uses thanks to memes) and man...I just love this stuff to death.
---
Machinima forever. This stuff rules. I LOVE how involved the community was with WoW, especially from Classic to Cataclysm. There were so many Machinimators, and they each did such cool things. It reminds me of TF2 and all the goofy Gmod and SFM animations you find surrounding that. It just feels like these games have so much value even outside of the game themselves thanks to the community, I love it.
---
If you read this, thanks for reading my gushing about some fan fic made into crazy well made machinima. I love this shit, man. If you excuse me, I have a movie to watch.
---
What is this baby talk I see repeated all the time?
---
yeah, i'm too busy to enjoy my game because i'm bothered with misdiagnosing others about their passions.
---
seems legit
---
&gt; To me it would absolutely break the race.
---
If something like that breaks it for you, please tell me you're going to pull out an old video card to run the game at low FPS because that's clearly the aesthetic you seem to desire.
---
They 100% did say this, you just didn't see / hear it. They very much said that they will remove layering regardless of what that means for the queues
---
I hope mine are still relevant.
---
Is he though?
---
that bent staff will hit the g spot 100 percent
---
this is fucking with my I M M E R S I O N
---
Oh whoops I meant to quote the part about model sizes. The flight animation is broken and needs to be fixed but as far as I'm aware, blizz hasn't commented on that yet anyway
---
Being able to shut up and take orders. Suddenly having 40 people in 1 channel is gonna be hard for the "im here to entertain" raiders.
---
This does relate to classic wow why was this removed??
---
Yes....?
---
Also wands. Wands are cool and useful.
---
You’ll also die a lot on trash. Once saw a shammy die three times on the same trash pack pulling aggro in AQ.
---
Because every community is different and that's the way it was. I'm definitely not remembering wrong, I also don't wear ruby-tinted goggles about Classic. How can you claim multiple people who specifically remember calling it VC? Stop trying to sound like a know-it all.
---
For PVP the end of MoP was the pinnacle of WoW class design IMO. Arenas were Great, kits were full and really fun, the rated BG scene was popping and really fun to be apart of. PVE was great from ToT to Siege of Org but siege just lasted WAY too long. (over 420 days... wow) I think the pvp and the great stretch of PVE in the middle is why MoP is held in such high regards while looking back.
---
Even better is when you don’t have a main, and they don’t kill you, they just kill the flight master, and you don’t have riding, and no one around is able to help. Love you Hillsbrad.
---
Just because you think it looks like ass doesn't mean it does. you could say that about literally anything, maybe they should put in the new water textures just so it doesn't look like ass
---
I recently applied to a guild recruiting now for classic. Told them I'd like to go warrior tank. They said no, we already have enough but we lack rogues.
---
That's not how I remember classic...
---
I'm definitely skeptical lol. The majority of prot talents are pretty worthless for Pvp. You get what, more armor and a stun on CD? You can't even take advantage of the +10% dmg from OHWS. Without enrage, MS, Imp Hamstring, etc. you're going to have very limited burst and overall output. Your rage gen will be severely reduced and your ability to do maximum damage when you're in range is severely limited. I could definitely forsee a prot getting kited to death pretty easily against basically any competent pvper.
---
&gt; how fast do you expect them to fix or respond to things?
---
If hundreds of random players can see something obviously missing that was in Vanilla, why are the people who built the game not picking up on it?  Why were flight animations ever removed from retail WoW in the first place? Laziness.
---
It's not a meme, you're ridiculous. VC was used on multiple servers. You just want to sound right.
---
I tried to upvote this more than once. Max nostalgia.
---
Glad to see it!
---
On a side note:  Holy hell you need to adjust your brightness.
---
This! I didn’t even notice but wow it’s such a huge difference. The old flight paths looked and felt so much better.
---
Dwarf rogue for me. 
---
Well for at least today, we’ll see if I change my mind tomorrow.
---
Blizzard wins. The games aren't in a competition. If anything, classic is going to subsidize retail expansions so they do.
---
I bought one 3 months ago for about $8 on Amazon and now the lowest offer is $65.  Crazy.
---
If you’re good, you don’t pull aggro from the tank.
---
This is amazing!
---
all the models in classic are ugly, but horde races have a reason to be ugly.
---
I played the stress test as a mage and I can safely confirm that this poster is full of it. 2 fireballs get wolves below 10% hp as it's always been. Mana cost looked the same as usual. 
---
But that's ok, I can understand the pressure of losing additional players in the increasingly empty retail.
---
Thankfully the pvp rewards are only delayed until p2. So anyone taking their time getting to 60 won’t have to wait long before they can get rank 3 for the discount
---
*Laughs in Warlock*
---
Random windfury crits are random.
---
Eh, maybe not in pve, but pvp ret should be pretty good considering it's 1.12...
---
I know you're probably speaking about PVE only but you didn't specify that, so 2 exceptions to your list would be Elemental Shamans and Shadow Priests for PVP. Both incredibly viable (although healing would be preferred on those classes for premade vs premade)
---
Who would have thought it, the wow killer was itself.
---
It's what happens when people complain about things they really have no idea about. The experts and the informed are almost always outnumbered.
---
For your words*
---
That makes sense and I get your point. However, Super Mario 64 and Pokémon Yellow are single player games... You play when you want, beat the game, move on. Maybe you do that 10 times if you love Super Mario but the point is that number is finite.
---
Vanilla is an MMO, it's playable and [arguably] only fun when there's people to play with. Similar to Super Mario, you might want to play it one day in 10 years but unlike Mario, with a low/non-existant community, you really won't be able to play the game (or atleast have fun doing it). Change, even small ones like balancing, keeps people around and new people trying the game. That's all I'm trying to say here. League of Legends has been rolling it for a decade now.. Same game, same rules, same map. It's the balancing and minor changes that keep it fresh.
---
Rogue seems way too far down this list...
---
I think they're viewed as bringing less to groups and raids than the other healers, and because their itemization is all over the place.
---
Except you're arguing that they should keep something that literally looks unrealistic, immersion-breaking, and physically retarded.
---
Besides the nostalgia circlejerk, what value is there in keeping it? Don't even bother screeching about "no changes" or "that's how it was in vanilla" because classic won't be vanilla. They've already jumped ship with layering so they might as well bring in the changes that don't actually alter gameplay but are visual improvements.
---
Imagine going to get your main but it spawns in on a different layer and can’t get the guy that’s camping you.
---
😂 the main reason I can’t roll a holy paladin, they have these beautiful tier sets and I’ll be wearing cloth and leather from start to fucking naxx.
---
I, like many, played Vanilla but I spent most of my time standing in IF jumping in circles. IDK why, looking back I literally wasted so much time doing fucking nothing. Still, I have more memories of that than I do with anything past WOTLK. LOL
---
Trolling then:
---
&gt;genuine satire, you just got rickrolled!!!! XD

Trolling now:

&gt;fascist dogwhistles
---
You wouldn't know a good player if it hit you in the face. Just to let you know I have applications in with the best top guilds in the game. I'll see you in my T3 and Atiesh
---
And these people get beta invites. Sigh.
---
And retailers are like the older sibling going mad because the new kid gets more attention
---
&gt; At least horde. I thought alliance was a little lackluster.
---
Drustvar was good.
---
Nobody is forcing anyone to get full pre-raid bis, where did I say that?
---
It just shows who is dedicated and who isn't.
---
also, learn the difference between to and too.

only class where racial is that important is dwarf priest for fearward i think
---

---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Drustvar was fucking tighttttttt. I will say that Haha.
---
Not that I agree, I think I started learning which classes I enjoyed in vanilla around 10-20 depending on class.   
---
But why would anyone think that's good design? That you can't have fun without putting in over 10+ hours? 
---
This is why shitty games like Fortnite and LoL have such a huge following, easy to get into and have fun even without skill. (Of course to get good you need to invest time). Yet everyone here seems to think you can't have fun without investing over 10 hours first.   
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm looking forward to Vanilla (but i've already experienced everything except for BFA), I agree retail became job like but if anyone wants to recruit a friend at this point why force them to level at a snails pace for content that's not relevant anymore?
---
I really don't think it will be that big of a deal for most raids, the biggest one will probably just be for the Alliance with Dwarf Priests, besides that big one though, I think it will mostly not matter, just pick what race you like the most and don't mind seeing the most.
---
Because finding human suffering humorous is ghoulish?
---
I can't decide between druid, shaman, mage, or my first true love Warlock. But I also like the idea of being a priest, too. Ahh. It's such a hard choice!
---
Vanilla started with 1.5m and ended with 8m. Wotlk Started with 11.5m and ended with 12m. Wotlk is to blame for wotlk numbers which weren't impressive. Most of wotlk numbers were hold overs from BC. which started with 8-8.5m and ended with 11-11.5m
---
My conclusion is that Classic made BC numbers, BC made wotlk number and wotlk was the nail in the coffin.
---
Almost no impact. There will, of course, be those people who are mentally challenged and refuse to invite anyone that isnt absolutely min/maxed but for the other 99% of the time, I won't matter very much.
---
I think attitudes will consolidate as we get close to naxx hitting the servers whether we want to see classic+ or tbc then wrath. Either ways some classic servers with patch 1.12 should be preserved.
---
Almost none. The only racial in the game that makes any sort of significant difference in pve is dwarf fear ward, and even that isn't super strong. For tanks and dps and other healers it makes almost no difference at all at the success of the raid level.
---
I highly doubt we'll leave flying behind even if blizz moves forward with more stuff after classic, TBC had huge numbers and people will want that back.
---
Play what you want. don’t let people tell you what to play. If you think it’s cool just do it
---
&gt; They've already jumped ship with layering so they might as well bring in the changes 
---
This train of thought is exactly why #nochanges was so important. As soon as they give any leverage, people like you jump on it and try to change everything else. The slope is actually slippery.
---
The point of Classic is to go back to the gameplay and style of Vanilla. That doesn’t bar new content that maintains that gameplay and style. This is an MMO which is inherently designed to be an evolving world so comparing it to single players games is ridiculous. And if you want to stay with the same content for the end of time, then Blizzard can let you stay on a content frozen server for all enternity. You got what you want so stop being greedy like the No Vanilla crowd has been for years when we asked to have Vanilla.
---
I love the dudes background. That’s hilarious
---
Dude how many times will you get to experience the Re-release Of world of Warcraft though!
---
Just play what you like and enjoy the ride. Staffing up rosters is going to take prevalence over min-maxing everything even among many high-end guilds, so unless you plan to compete for world firsts I wouldn't worry about it at all.
---
Vanilla is not for everyone. You think you do but you dont is accurate. Just not for all people.
---
Professions were all I did up until sometime during mists. I'm so excited for them!
---
Yo I know this font. You got to ISU don’t you?
---
Not only that, but a loyal hybrid player who is happy to have a home is more desirable than a pure DPS player that leaves and takes their loot with them when a more progressed guild comes calling.
---
I've always thought that would be a neat (if unlikely) direction to go post-Naxx
---
Don't just re-release TBC, rework it without flying.
---
Release WotLK and Cata and MoP and WoD, but not LFG/LFR or sharding or WF/TF.
---
Like I said, this is unlikely, but and a sort of "alternate timeline" version of each of the  xpacs would be awesome.
---
Unless no one goes back to retail after playing classic...
---
SM/ruin is a all around okay spec for both pve and pvp.  Not the best in each, but adequate for both.
---
This topic pops up a lot. I can't speak for anything else, but Darnassus (as a human) is definitely possible by ~44 on private servers that *don't* have spill over. I've done it.
---
And yes, there is the potential that a handful of quests on Pservers have incorrect rep values but I've been able to confirm many using the waybackmachine and looking though allakazam and thottbot.
---
I've been told that spillover (getting rep for doing other factions' quests up until the middle of honored)  is functioning properly on the beta so it may be even quicker on Classic.
---
Priest 3rd. LIARS! LIARS THE LOT OF YOU!
---
Well it's because the most efficient way to get honor is doing WSG, and rogues are pretty mediocre in group pvp so they usually get stuck with guard duty. Same if you do AB too, you guard farm or stables.
---
Private servers might have some new meta that's better, but that's how it was in vanilla.
---
What's a better spec for PvP?
---
I don't know much about vanilla outside of the last few weeks but in TBC the 39 and 49 brackets were fun as hell.
---
If you're paid $.5 per hour it probably isn't, if you're a billionaire it probably is.
---
don't mimimize the struggle you fucks horde or alliance, the struggle was real!
---
Naxxramas is ours
---
Except it doesn't. It still has great story content. It still has raids, pvp, mythic + and many other things to keep you busy if you want. WoW transitioned into a story first linear game which it was destined to do after awhile. People want that Warcraft soap opera.
---
Wait what? I've played Vanilla since day 1 and never had a dungeon group without a healer...? Maybe because I played custom games on Warcraft 3 but I've never even heard of anyone not bringing in a healer (anyone who could heal, they didn't have to be main specc'd healing).
---
Or you can just say "we're drawing a line with the changes", something retail never had but Classic obviously has.
---
Something like mailing more than 1 item will never lead to Dungeon Finder.
---
Agree, personally i would like 1. Cds to reset in duels 2. Arena 3. Make pretty much all group pve content harder maybe by buffing hp/dmg and maybe even adding mechanics
---
Rolled a troll in 2004. Can confirm
---
you could also make portals for your main and enchant stuff :P
---
That's just simply not true. 8-8.5m at the end of vanilla. 
---
Btw Wotlk only saw 500k additional subs, the game STOPPED growing during wotlk. 
---
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ibJJaNnI4T0/UyLWBayUk3I/AAAAAAAAFmk/oAvYUpHCQmw/s1600/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin_b.png
---
Personally, I just don't want the gameplay changed. I don't care if they make the game look *better*. If there's anything that retail has it's that it looks good.
---
The fact that people in this sub have accepted layering but are getting absolutely butthurt about keeping shitty animations is like fighting for pennies when someone is stealing hundreds from you.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?npcs&amp;filter=type=\[1\];](https://classicdb.ch/?npcs&amp;filter=type=[1];)
---
Why not just have alts on the same account?
---
IIRC, disc with a little bit of holy at 60 was the primo priest healer spec
---
Not reliant? Maybe not, but certainly one of the classes that benefit from it the most. Gnomish net for extra peel, rocket boots for extra speed, invis trinket for stealth in combat, rocket helm for mobility etc. It basically enhances your already super strong toolkit of mobility. A druid with engineering items equipped is next to impossible to kill for one person.
---
Cheers for that
---
People aren't going to abandon retail. Some people have put 15 years into that game and new people like it because it is more fast paced and you can pretty much just play an hour a day once you are max level unless you decide to run Mythic Raids. 
---
I will probably cut my time down on BFA so that i can play classic a little more. i'll split my time 70/30 because i enjoy the pacing of vanilla more.
---
So true. Make it happen blizzard!
---
It seems like the best option for a pvp'er who cant really invest the time into getting geared.  Even if I dont fully "twink" out I think I can be competitive even with twinks in that bracket because the gear is all good. And yea it is basically like 60 pvp at 49... you have you 31 point talent and most abilities. I would say even more balanced because no raiding gear.
---
Welcome to the new world.
---
Presumably they had to level the bank alt to 60 and take it through BWL and the whole quest line.  I'm having a hard time believing anyone would go that far, since they'd already be investing time and effort into one or two "real" Scarab Lords-to-be in the guild.
---
I was playing daoc, I may try OSRS
---
PGY-2 kicking off too
---
He then took me to barrens when I was like level 20 or so and we “raided” camp taurajo, was pretty insane
---
Why would you do such a thing? Tirisfal is a great place to level.
---
Yeah the side grade idea is what I would like to see. The only difference is the looks and maybe set bonuses. That way you get more customization without adding transmog which maintains class identity and it keeps away power creep.
---
"Don't be a tunahead"
---
Me and my friend group from Hugh school are doing this. All in our thirties. We bonded over wow back in the days so it felt fitting to relive something we did every summer back in those days.
---
Or simply find a work around, like if there were a spot where you would originally have to fly your mount, maybe add a flight master or something
---
People are good at blaming things they dont understand.
---
The developers themselves arent responsible for the changes to WoW. Its business. The game was started in a time before (and contributed to) MMO's becoming a multi-billion dollar industry and business simply took over once the business-side see a product that can be harvested for $$.
---
This is the world we live in, it applies to everything that becomes mainstream. Developers at the end of the day, are there to pay the bills and feed their families. They get told to make it easier to appeal to new markets (non-gamers or younger gamers).
---
There are cycles in popularity trends though, which is why classic has come to be - just like hipsters, retro pop culture, etc. It will repeat itself forever.
---
Same
---
I keep my contrast pretty high up but adjust brightness and gamma until it looks really good. High contrast looks really good if you have it set up really well.
---
Also Dwarf Rogue.
---
Corn staff!
---
Okay, that definitely is good to hear. I appreciate the input!
---
Haha, you're not wrong. :)
---
Check out some of the twitch streams. Literal pvp blood baths and people doing scarlet armory as lvl 30. So much pain and joy.
---
You definitely ported to where the group leader queued from. You could use it as a HS as you said but I remember our group would queue at the Silverwing outpost and we would all end up hanging out there.
---
This needs to be reported.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy)
---
Fresh servers would decimate the player base. Just cause a group of hard core dedicated private servers did it cuz their old server got shut down, doesn't mean that will work out for the masses. Many people would just quit or go back to retail if they did that.
---
**Black comedy**
---
Black comedy, also known as dark comedy or gallows humor, is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues, by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience. Popular themes of the genre include death and violence, discrimination, disease, and sexuality.
---
Black comedy differs from blue comedy which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity, sex, and bodily fluids; and from straightforward obscenity.

Except that's not an mmo and no not everyone wins there, server merging in general kills immersion among other things.

I think the old one looks better thats the value in keeping it =)

Mirror?

Tauren Druid 5eva
---
Doxxing is worse now, yeah, but as far as censorship of offensive words goes it's a lot more strict.
---
Pretty much any server that doesn't have a streamer on it will be fine. It won't have long que times (esp. when the streamer is playing) because every fanboy wants to see their fav. streamer in open world for 2sec. And if that streamer quits or jumps servers, the pop. there will take a huge hit. 
---
It's hard to guess which servers will be pop. and unpop. but it's probably a safe bet for any. All you need is a good guild and 39 peeps to get shit done.
---
Except we don't need to keep splitting the community, that's not really what keeps everyone happy
---
Horde has Auctioneer Thathung
---
The top Horde guild on my server was "Illuminati", run by "Jurkk" (or something like that).  So I (Alliance) named my bank alt "Jerkk" and put him in the guild "Illuminaughty".  I think only one or two people ever got it.
---
And of course I decked him out with the obligatory cane, rings, etc.
---
Here's a thought -
---
If BFA had talent trees similar to classic, similar leveling difficulty, no flying mounts, no instancing, no group finder, no Titan forging, no transmog (these are just the major things that come to mind), would you still be playing retail happily?
---
I'm just arguing that a lot of us love Vanilla for the mechanics and the MMO feel, not strictly for the content. Classic is a chance to start over with the same mechanics that we all loved.
---
This sub loves to say "if you want change go play BFA". That's not the point... If BFA had classic-like mechanics I gladly would.. But it doesn't - it feels like a different game.
---
There were different ones, we mostly did it when we geared someones Alt so there were basically one fresh dinged lvl 60 whatever class, me tanking (Warrior), Priest or Pala healing, and then we filled the spots with whatever dps was available, mostly there was a warlock and a rogue with us.
---
But at that Gearlevel you just bruteforce the Dungeon with your insane dps. I also tanked in the fury-tank specc where you have Bloodthrist for maximum TPS (was also my Job in the Raid as the Offtank), and also wearing stuff like Lionheart and not T2 Helm.
---
Yeah that's unfortunate for that classwork for sure.
---
Nah its the other way around matey. Most vanilla players are hateful to retail so retail players are just giving it back to them.
---
Yeah...in order to avoid this issue, just watch their stream on launch day or create char after work/school.
---
He doesn't have to be right about everything to be right about classic. But I agree , you shouldn't blindly follow ppl like this, even tho I agree with the things he said.
---
I had two accounts for the end on vanilla and into burning crusade. Its not worth it in my opinion. Dual boxing is kinda hard and not really fun.
---
It also couldn't see (very importantly) when you stop casting a spell. It only read the "starts casting X" and gives a casting bar timer based on that.
---
Vanilla content isn't so hard where racials make that much of an impact
---
This is why I stuck to AB premades once it came out.
---
First time in a long time I see actual skill used in pvp in world of warcraft. Well played.
---
Everyone should watch it. It's educational, funny, sad and infuriates you at the same time.
---
I mean if you really wanna manage to accounts like that sure. I just feel like it isn't necessary
---
I played briefly on Deathwing from Cata-WOD. That server was...interesting.
---
You can but it’s kinda boring boosting like that. Personally I’d have a lot more fun doing dungeons with the right level groups.
---
I killed (or tried) anything that moved on my path. Didn't stop to particularly camp anyone. But if I was grinding and they keep showing up, they keep dieing. Grey or not. It's war, red=dead.
---
I hear their healing is worst in game.  But how much further behind the others is it?    I want to heal anyways and interested in druid.
---
It wasn’t even a link, it was a picture. Find me a link and I’ll “look at all of it more carefully.” It’s fake.
---
Thinking about trying that.  I gave my day 1 account to a guildmate when I quit in TBC.  
---
He played up through cata and hasn't logged into Bnet since then.  
---
Not sure I remember my old addy and number though.
---
That would be cool to branch off.. Leaving a 1.12 and going to BC. I just hope that along the process, some of the negative parts of retail aren't brought back. And to determine what's negative there could be in game polling with a high % req to pass, similar to osrs.
---
But the thing is that your analogy falls flat. There *are* music enthusiasts who literally go out of their way to buy vinyls, insist on the practice, and create an entire subcultural industry for it. They actively disdain pop music, and they're happy to listen to old stuff for years on end without any alteration to their behavior.
---
I honestly am not utterly repulsed by "Classic Plus", per se, but I have no need for it. I will happily play Classic for years on end, and I'm far from the only person who wants that. If other people want "new content", BfA already exists. They are the Rhianna listeners to my vinyl enthusiast. There's no problem with them liking Rhianna, but to say that I can't continue to enjoy vinyls as they were made to be, and supplant them with new vinyls that spin differently, don't sound the same, play remixes of music that didn't need remixes, and at the same time prevent anyone from getting their vinyls as they wanted them, would be utterly egregious.
---
Filthy casual
---
Nope.
---
There have been so many questions asked about this. Just play what you like and find fun. Classic isn’t about min/maxing as much as its about exploring Azeroth as who/what you enjoy.
---
There is no "best spec" since it all comes to your personal preference. 
---
Besides SL, which has the edge in duel scenarios. 
---
Raiding takes way less time than ranking does, and SM/Ruin can fit for both purposes, but as it's already been said - not the best yet very feasible.
---
I decided I'm going to roll a hunter. I didn't get the chance to play vanilla as I started WoW beginning of Wrath and never played private. I'm not the greatest player in the world, but I enjoy the journey of a character and social aspects of the game more than anything, and like the class fantasy of hunter a lot so I think that's the best option for me.
---
Most of the warriors will end up as rogues.
---
There's a pretty wide margin being covered by that statement.
---
There are *some* applications for paladins in Raiding but they are niche. You can tank the suppression room really well with Consecration and some thorns gear, probably better than a Warrior can.
---
You can definetly level and do dungeons both as Ret and Prot at maxlevel for sure, but don't expect to be invited to all the raids. You'd be best off making a guild that's fine with less conventional specs if you wanna try stuff like that out, that way everyone involved will be fine with that.
---
Sounds fun to be honest. Best of luck to OP, however they might choose.
---
The human weapon specialization is big. If you end up in a serious guild and become a dedicated raider, just know that you are losing out on dps/tps as a nelf. Some people would be greatly bothered by that fact, others not so much. Depends on a minmax mindset or not.
---
I was a pally main back in the day and I never got over the betrayal I felt of protection paladin. Going into a class thinking of all the awesome things you will do with you sword and shield then being relegated to spamming flash of light for 4+ hours in raid........
---
I do realize that they can function in their other specs, but I remember being so freaking salty that the best hybrid class in wow was the warrior. 
---
All said though that is my hang up, I do remember some good times on my paladin, shockadin being a particular highlight when you gained access to BWL gear :D
---
orc warlock will be better than undead warlock 100% of the time on horde
---
just like gnome is for alliance.
---
My only concerns is post-60 (if I get there), how limited will it be?
---
We colluded back in Vanilla also.  I only hit rank 11 but it was well known you were expected to abide by the "cap" if you intended to go higher.
---
Yes, it's one of things it could be done, although it's also often abused to make more pageviews. This could be split into like 2-3 separate articles if needed.
---
this was the best part of the movie.
---
Nah man lookin at your post history you’re definitely the one to talk about lame if this is how your spend your Saturday nights. Also the animation wasn’t fixed because it was broken it’s because the models were updated, thus the animations are different now than in the Vanilla game thus they should be changed to reflect how it was.
---
Have a good night tho homie
---
Ah I see. There are some good Destro specs for pvp/pve i believe, right? Might look into some of those to try
---
For boosting? Probably not. You could just get a friend to run you through low level dungeons. Now, if you want to play both factions on a PvP server, it's really your only option. I've thought about it, but I think I want to keep the whole faction rivalry thing intact.
---
Esfand, a big streamer, is planning on playing Ret and explicitly advises against trying what he is doing. Ret is great for leveling and can work in PVP, but Paladin in Vanilla is such a strong Healer and does so little DPS as Ret that it's hard to justify bringing multiple Rets to raids.
---
Having like, one is probably fine as you still bring Auras, buffs etc. with you.
---
That's kinda the point, there's too many variables make the decision for op.
---
&gt; o an empty desk to the professor makes you look less deserving compared to the people showing up on day 1.
---
&gt;Professors at my college drop any student who doesn't attend the first day
---
Yea but that makes no sense. You can't say it's 'undeserved' when the only reason people show up is out of fear.
---
By 1.12, flight paths were connected and all you had to do was hit your final destination.
---
I'll be surprised if the majority roll warrior. Most I think will reroll before 20 since you are only investing a days worth of leveling. 
---
Hope you all have a pocket healer.
---
Yea I understand that, but when you have that much info, sometimes it's good to break it up.
---
there for sure will be guilds that are formed from lvl 60s in classic, and not out of game, so if you are a decently geared lvl 60 rogue ahead of most of the server you have pretty good chances of being picked before others
---
Consumables are not for certain fights. They are for every fight. If you’re melee and aren’t bringing jujus+elixirs+food buff you’re going to be doing much less DPS than you could be doing. If all raiders aren’t putting out max dps, raids go slower and have more risks of wiping. Slower raid plus more wipes equals low raid morale. Low raid morale equals people guild hopping to better guilds or quitting the game/raiding. Always bring your consumes if you want to be a good raider.
---
Prob for the best.
---
Oh they forgot about you alright. They did it on purpose because they dont even know who you are.
---
Druids are better in 5 man's than warriors. They generate more threat and they provide the feral buff for your melee dps. For raiding druids are quite frankly just as viable outside of a couple select boss fights just because there isn't any gear options for ferals.
---
Because they didn't.
---
Why do you double that number?   That's still the people who will play pally?
---
&gt;Is a very new idea
---
Doing *decent* damage, sure, but even in Ion's ZA speedrun video you can see him playing Resto and in his downtime, he's casting some lightning bolts and throwing out Flame shocks.
---
It's totally fine to sneak in some damage here and there when healing, as long as nobody dies and you're fine on the mana side of things you can do some dmaage here and there, esp. once you're overgeared.
---
In general, I'd agree though. You will most likely not find a lot of time doing that, and spells cost a ton of Mana in Classic. Unless you're an AQ40/Naxx geared Pally, you'll encounter Mana issues if you start using damage spells for DPS in healing downtime.
---
I bet they've never killed a wolf or cast a fireball in real life.  You'd think the fantasy of being able to do either, would be a tad better than mediocre.
---
&gt; What if she changed her mind after 4 years and decides she's not ok with you having hookers, opiates and alcholism as hobbies and though she was at first?
---
Sucks to be her, she knew what she was getting into.
---
Yes. If you enjoy reading quests, yes. If you enjoy things you do with your character in terms of points, yes. If you enjoy slow, meaningful progression, yes. If you enjoy having to form communities to play in the end game, yes. If you enjoy playing in groups, yes. If you enjoy playing a role or role playing, yes. If you enjoy ganking the Alliance in Stranglerthorn, yes. If you enjoy ganking the Horde in Crossroads, yes. 
---
TLDR: Yes you noob.
---
Or things like more strength on mail for enhance, spell damage on plate for ret and prot, or good items for druid tanks.
---
Me
---
its the perfect intro. trust
---
I dont believe any viable pve spec goes past ruin. So either SM/ruin or DS/ruin
---
This guy has been playing for 15 years and will abandon Retail as soon as Classic launches. No need to mindlessly log in to do Retail dailies that hardly matter when I can log into Classic and do everything that matters.
---
Poor burst healing, mainly used to heal raid party while priest and pally focus on the tank. Druids also have Mark of the Wild which is useful.
---
Bring back gatekeeping. this is getting ridiculous.
---
Man, I never played druid in my wow career.   I've never healed.   I'm thinking of rolling it so hard and getting excited
---
&gt; an out-of-shape useless sack of shit who refuses to enter the real world
---
Doing whatever activity you enjoy ''in the real world'' is no more a better hobby than gaming.
---
No it actually doesn't say that!
---
1 is abusable (paladins dueling to reset LoH cd) but if implemented correctly, that would be an awesome plus for dueling (an example is only cds that were actually used during the duration of the duel get reset afterwards. Maybe cap it so this doesn't affect cds longer than 10 mins. This will allow 2-3 min cds to come back for subsequent duels while maintaining the feeling of "going all out" when using powerful and long cds like lay on hands).
---
Whether it subjectively looks good or bad, it objectively looks wrong.
---
Just make sure you use a different password than what you plan on using in classic
---
I start 10 weeks paternity when Classic releases.
---
K3 was horde dominated. But yeah most pservers it's ally favored
---
This is literally me.
---
Obligatory, do you think it would be worth it this is a subjective question
---
I might actually try that on my server if I remember to do so. Having a bit of Gold and a potentially okish trinket as well sounds neat for starting out.
---
Is there guild recruitment threads in this sub?

I thought it came out the 26th for NA?
---
It really depends on how serious you plan to play. If you're going to play casually or semi-hardcore, it won't matter *at all*. The differences are relatively small in the grand scheme of things.
---
But if you're going try and shoot for a server/world first guild, they ~~may~~ be more picky. If you're trying to be as effective as possible, there is no reason to not chose the most optimal race/class combo.
---
Aw, I love Mulgore. Always been the most peaceful to me.
---
Because there will be cross realm bgs, you shouldnt have an issue in any of the brackets.
---
That contrast though. http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/
---
Out of all the garbage that’s posted here this is the most bizarre way to go
---
SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin are the pve choices. 
---
For pvp, there's a deeper destro spec that's viable.
---
Minimal. Some are better, but raid leaders bring the class not the race.
---
Depends on your class. Melee is best as orc, fury is just better. Warlock is better as orc since UD have no dps racials. Troll is better as a mage than UD for the same reasons. Troll would make a better shaman for cast times. Troll would also be a better priest. Hunter is best as orc. These are all for pve. Orc has best racials in the game for PVP
---
Honest answer? Because the pserver community has had some degen server owners in the past and I wouldn't put it past some of them to sell your data to hackers or scammers. Or do what the original Chinese gold farmers would do and try passwords you used on other sites for your wow password and steal your gold

I've only ever tried one mmorpg game, and that's vanilla/TBC wow.  I only allow myself to have one game to consume me per year due to the time sink.  I think I'll allow only one mmorpg per life time.  But FFXI does sound fun!

---
The 39 bracket is significantly more popular than the 49 bracket. However with cross realm BGs I expect both to be very active. If you're really concerned about population you could always leave your character at level 35 until WSG releases and then ask around about how many different BGs are going on in each bracket in your battlegroup and make your decision with that info.

This reminded me of the Rhok'delar questline, or when I had to solo the Sunken Temple drake for Devilsaur eye trinket because I couldn't find a group.
---
at launch? I thought that was coming in a later phase?
---
Destro specs are definetely viable in PvP (for example 5/7/39 or Nightfall/Conflag) yet they are the squishiest ones, but with the highest damage output. 
---
Sadly there is nothing good PvE-wise about them, but we might see some top-edge guilds trying out firelock specs for the sake of debuff slot management.
---
&gt; DireMaul in the classic days.
---
This one should definitely be in the game. Dire Maul Tribute farming is a huge chunk of why I'm rolling Hunter.
---
oh ok, cool. Do you have a link to any reputable website for those builds?
---
By definition, he’s gonna get a lot seeing as how it’s still player vs player.  Now, how much fair PvP is he gonna get?  Probably not a lot unless some people show up to help the lowbies and he isn’t too scared to attack people his own level as well.
---
lmao whatever you say
---
It dosnt matter bro
---
49 was a great bracket. You have most of the abilities and mounts.
---
Pretty sure Brady Games got their info from the developer directly.
---
Also second monitor is for streams too.
---
&gt;	but I’m 35 now and have a shit ton of kids 
---
Bro maybe it’s time to get the snip snip done?
---
Just practice leveling on pserver like I’m doing, you want a crazy launch experience play on the one who rhymes with tale, it’s insanely populated in the leveling zones right now almost every day
---
I'm a bit late to this, but also worth mentioning that the dreadsteed was quite expensive. It honestly really was about equal in cost with regular epic mounts when all was said and done.

&gt; this is the best time to start, you get a second chance
---
He really gets the best experience. Modern servers/hardware/latency/addons, experienced players that will be able to show him the way, and a plethora of guides if he wants to google them.
---
Lmao real shit tbh, I'm getting sick of seeing these stupid ass nitpicky topics that 90% of people won't give a shit about. I played vanilla on a pserver for a while but this change means nothing to me. Every day I see something that people are complaining about. It's getting old quick.
---
Cut my finger on all the edge in that picture.
---
It’s tough because Druid is really bad until 20 and then spikes insanely hard with cat form. But it’s also a weird one since you’ll be mostly healing at 60 if you want to raid
---
Never experienced that camera issue with mouse turning in a decade and a half of playing.

---
The actual difference is pretty negligable, however on private servers I have seen people get rejected from guilds because they ran nelf warrior or whatever. It's not common but I think some people see it as "well if you couldn't even choose the proper race because you don't like the way some pixels on your screen look, why should we trust you to be hardcore". It's honestly pretty rare though and I doubt many guilds are gonna be like that on classic
---
If you're NA, the game goes live Aug26th @1800 EST.   
---
OP got shit on. :(
---
IF will be the main hub. Both MC and BWL are closer to it.
---
Are you me?
---
The little Payo ofc
---
Same I love leveling a hunter but can’t stand how boring they are at 60 and hate the dead zone mechanic in PvP
---
Wasn't it pretty much just better to go get the regular epic mounts because you'd either have to have friends carry you through various instances or pay for peoples help in addition to getting the reagents?
---
I just saw this Troll today and was wondering why he is there.   
---
This is interesting.
---
[------] breached containment, al... remaini.. fac.. .... evac..
---
He wasn't a marketing guy. He was a producer on WoW starting with the Burning Crusade.
---
The steve jobs video was cool tho.
---
Trolling was a much finer art to do well though, not "hurr hurr I trolled you" after making a shit 'joke'
---
Thanks now i won't be able to sleep...
---
streamers have left the chat
---
yea im leaning towards 49 but 39 ele shaman is fun with having ghost wolf being the fastest on the map other than druids....
---
But with 49 I get the 100% crit chance which means every 3 minutes I can 1 shot somebody LOL.  And mounts are fun but I kind of like the pacing of no mounts sometimes.... more isolated fights and less zerging
---
First ranking and rewards will come out and then bgs will be available later
---
This can't be unseen
---
This subreddit is a cesspool of arrogance, rudeness and whining about the most mundane things, I want to stay subbed for news and funny clips but it’s getting a bit much.
---
&gt; Consumables are not for certain fights. They are for every fight.
---
I was in an AQ/Naxx guild and I disagree with this. First of all, using consumes before the guild knows the mechanics is a waste of gold. An extra 50 DPS won't matter when C'thun eye beam wipes you all.
---
Secondly, I don't see the point of popping Mongoose when the whole raid is decked in BWL/AQ gear and you're reclearing MC.
---
thats a good idea I was leaning towards 49 but I think parking at 35 is a great idea.  Cause honestly for Ele Sham 39 is super fun because of ghost wolf and no mounts...I hope they release WSG quickly...
---
Depends on what you need help with. For leveling I'd look at the kargoz guide, for pvp I'd look for vods of those pvp duel tournaments on YouTube and study that. I've seen some absolute nutter rogues at those, but not many of them streamed from what I could tell though
---
Agreed. There's a few design pillars to WHY vanilla is so fun -
---
- leveling is hard and thus feels rewarding
---
- gearing is harder/rares are harder to come by and no transmog gives the feeling of uniqueness. Random pruned stats and effects allow theorycrafting.
---
- no instancing gives feeling of belonging to a community where you/your guild make a name for yourself in your community 
---
- no flying mounts and group finder forced you to interact 
---
These are just to name a few. Pushing new content while maintaining the design pillars would be amazing and keep the content fresh.
---
Thank you
---
Quit in TBC. This is the only mmo I ever truly loved.
---
I've seen thousands of people in the beta who are just regular folks
---
I wonder if they will balance the classes at all because classic druid sucked in all aspects.
---
I'd say retrowow. You get instant level 60, access to all the abilities and talents right away
---
The hero we need, but don't deserve.
---
It's worse on horde where shamans are flat out superior at raid healing. You basically just need one druid to buff, keep regrowth up on the tank, and innervate or brez a priest if necessary.
---
Next bathe in those moonwells. You can't fathom how much Night Elf pubic hair is floating around. :V
---
Will the 10 second mage be a thing again?
---
Ehm, the first one looks like he's gliding on ice.
---
You do you man, I'll be riding on my skeletal horse even as an orc.
---
I saw someone playing BfA the other day, doesn’t its graphics look a lot like fortnight? Classic was very good looking, you can see the influence of current gaming styles on current WoW . Instant gratification and cartoony cheap graphics
---
It's because everyone knows Warrior is top DPS.
---
yep- they know there is a decent chance classic will outstrip retail in time, and their precious sandpit filled with free toys will become worthless
---
This is one of the things I really missed about old rogue. It's a shame we probably won't get swirly ball back as it was removed in 1.12. RIP swirly ball.
---
Thank you!
---
I played in Vanilla and TBC but mostly did PvP, it wasn't until Wrath that I raided, and I really enjoyed it. I didn't stop playing because of the dungeon finder, I stopped playing because I could see the writing on the wall with Cataclysm -- the game was being dumbed down, and I really did not agree with that. Old WoW had this massive hook that would get deep inside of you because each class brought something unique to the board, and you had more options for how to play in a niche way. The talents were subtle and represented choice, as soon as that character identity went away I lost interest.
---
I think the whole city is

You tell us. It’s your money.

---
I’d say “more sanitized” over “more safe” nowadays. I don’t remember the SWAT being called on anyone for minor transgressions back in the day, they just used mean words.
---
I’d rather have the mean words.
---
Rule #1?
---
"trolling" has lost it's meaning, just like "meme"
---
Now days "trolls" who go "trolling" are usually just people who disagree with you on twitter. 
---
Instead of actively attempting to bait you into a reaction/getting involved.
---
Meme's used to be TEXT picture of meme TEXT, now anything is a fucking "meme".
---
Don't take me serious though, I'm just memeing.
---
D: classic isnt like bfa
---
Equal amount of rogues and hunters, what is this?
---
They say all comedy is based on misery
---
Source for this?
---
“Get ready for a classic summer” they said. “Get an education” mom said. “Throw away my life” I said.
---
too long didn't read
---
Just go back to playing the kiddie game BfA
---
I plan on playing both at some rate.
---
Do you mean 10 minute?
---
Yes, to stay true to the original vanilla experience, about 70% of the playerbase must call rogues "rouge".
---
On top of showing up on time and prepared, being willing to learn or admit mistakes is huge. 
---
Basically just be a normal adult human.
---
The world record was 4 days 20 hours. Casuals will need 6-8 days /played. That's conditional on a) knowing where and how to quest and b) only focusing on leveling. If you play 10 hours a day, that's 2.5 weeks.
---
pvp(dot)henhou(dot)se
---
Yeah I'm really hoping they change their mind and release AB in an earlier phase as it's my favorite BG.
---
Sadly, This is probably true.
---
But retail already did that and Anduin is still the alliance leader aka ?????
---
I say. Loggin on launch day knowing it will be hopeless. But just do it anyway and then explain to her this is how it is on launch day etc and then after 30 min or 1 hour just say “you know what let’s loggin tomorrow instead because this is hopeless. It will be better tomorrow I’m sure babe.” ( I used this move every single expansion with my wife, since TBC. It will make it look like it’s your idea even tho she was about to say that anyway and it will make you look like you are pretty casual about the game and won’t ditch her for the game in the weeks to come... haha if she just knew). 
---
Day 2 will be much better, much much better! But every zone will still be packed so she will eventually get tired coz it is too much waiting around for mobs to spawn especially mobs like Hogger, those usually take longer. This is important now, let her say it... coz she will say like this “honey I need a break,  but you can keep on playing if you want”. This is when your master plan comes true! What she doesn’t know is that you chose to level your alt with her and now that she finally get you time to play you will create your main char which you will play every free available time you have when she isn’t around. This will come in handy later too coz then you can just start boosting her when you’re high enough and the game will become less challenging for her so she will begin to play longer sessions and you get to play more and more.
---
I know someone who legitimately thinks Classic will be dead in a month. We’re gunna have beta for 3 months so if it doesn’t die by then (btw might be only to level 30 for those months) then it will last way longer than a month. He’s so pessimistic it blows my mind. When I call him on it all he says is “I’ve done WAY more in WoW than you ever had.” 
---
People want this to fail. Why not have their game and we have ours. If you don’t like it don’t play it but don’t try and sabotage it.
---
I like my women dumpy and droopy, with a little bit of halitosis.
---
sure, but i dont think the original wow staff knew the minmaxing info about characters quests and pretty much everything else that the community does now.
---
Only if you're planning on doing some weird challenges in game that basically require multiboxing. For example, it's possible to become Honoured with both the Magram and Gelkis centaur clans, if you're in a group with someone farming them but you don't actually participate in the combat at all.
---
&gt;but vanilla pvp ranks mean nothing to me because it has nothing to do with skill
---
But that's false. An average player has zero chance of ever getting rank 14 because you need to get an increasing number of kills each week, to be accurate, over 20% more kills each week than the previous one.
---
In other words, even though deaths do not lower your rank, anyone who ever gets to rank 14 in vanilla has a very high kill to death ratio.
---
We always called em 10 second.. fire arcane combo with presence of mind and instant pyroblast?

I’m all for spreading information but I really can’t tell who this video is meant to be for. I was 9 at the initial vanilla launch playing a Nelf hunter on my dad’s account when he worked late nights and even I figured out for myself that placing traps and slowing beforehand was the best way to go about it. This just feels... kinda useless
---
The games not even out yet and you guys are already asking for possible updates that wouldnt even happen until a while after naxx since they dont want to rush through it even reaching naxx is a long time away... how about you let the game release, stablize in player base then ask the actual community that will be playing if they want furthering content.
---
I played pserver in a semi hardcore guild. We could do MC and half of BWL in a 3.5 hour raid time. It took me about 4-6 hours per week to farm gold and consumables. I used full consumables for every fight and trash because I’m a meter whore, but this also got me close to top priority for weapons and gear without being an officer. Once ZG came out and we were doing Ony, MC, BWL and ZG it became incredibly time consuming. We would raid like 3 nights a week for 3-4 hours and you really have to do that if you plan on being able to clear AQ when it comes out. Classic was announced and our guild broke up but it was becoming a bit of a burn out for me because we were carrying some low DPS players and people who didn’t know how to execute on Chromag and Nef
---
I think they mean people are conflicted about changes in general. Not #nochanges like adding dks or something. I think they mean blizzards “fixes” to issues in the beta is difficult to please everyone.
---
It's less of a realistic problem and more of a nostalgic thing. I actually prefer the first clip because it's what I remember Rogues feeling like then. It's more accurate.
---
I’m not very good at finding bugs or remembering all the things from pre-bc so I try to keep an eye on forums to test things people ask or report things people know is wrong.
---
There are no BGs at all at launch, but when BGs are released they will have cross-realm from the beginning.
---
Not only does it have a geographical advantage with menethil harbor covering kalimdor incredibly well, it also has a very convenient layout.   
---
Between the AH and bank/mailbox there is a nice big open area which just feels better than being in tight streets that stormwind offers.  
---
  the small bridge is a great meeting point for creating PUG groups, and you have close proximity to the BG queue area where another mailbox is located.   The dueling area is also just a 10 second walk from the AH.
---
The gold is a huge advantage
---
Yeah Im in the camp that thinks all BG's should come out at once.... I mean why wait... It seems like theres no benefit.  I understand raids for obvious reasons but phasing in BG's imo is stupid.
---

---
Wtf this looks terrible like someone trying to walk with two broken legs.
---
Yes. What makes it so good? It's a perfect formula of fun and friendship, second to no other game I've ever played.
---
The sense of accomplishment, adventure, victory and defeat, battles and quests. Most of all WoW organically manifests a non-toxic thriving social structure that no other game has ever accomplished. The world is gorgeous, the mmorpg gameplay is as close to perfect as anyone's been able to achieve in the last 2 decades. 10/10 would recommend
---
Definitely hen house. Retrowow is shit.
---
ZG is very time consuming I feel like, add in all the travel times and such between raids and you can end up raiding quite a bit. 20 seems high but I did around 12-15 on a pserver and felt like my guild was fairly decent. We weren’t APES or anything but weren’t terrible. It’s tough to get 40 good players though
---
Because most wives dont like their husbands being "lazy" and not available on command to pay attention to her 24/7. Gotta marry wisely or else suffer eternally until the divorce where she gets everything and child support too.
---
That's not skill at all. This guy has been playing private servers for 5 years. People will catch up fast and higher IQ players will shit on him and his Classicast friends.
---
Why would you boost yourself through dungeons? It’s a very slow way of leveling.
---
Except for all the evidence that it is, in fact, correct. Every time. Constantly.
---
Let's rephrase this to be more accurate - 
---
"Some things you believe to be accurate due to time spent on private servers is inaccurate. We're giving you the thing you've been literally begging us for - accurate Classic WoW.
---
Thanks,
---
Blizzard"
---
Warrior. I plan on being Main Tank and that's the only choice.
---
It's a fun playstyle in both Dungeons and raids and has a lot of responsibility, which I quite enjoy. I'll probably roll a Hunter alt, sounds like a fun PVP class.
---
Sorry zoomers its boomtime
---
It's fine. Streamers will just report people and blizzard will immediately ban them.
---
I agree. Blizzard could release AB and AV at the same time as WSG and then just not put the vendor rep rewards in the game until a later phase.
---
I plan on playing retail just to get hold to purchase tokens, i went down to only playing 1 character now.
---
maybe the game is teaching you that you shouldn't spam abilities, a useful skill later in the game. sounds more like great game design to me.
---
Depends if you want to be tanky or a glass cannon. It’s best to try both out and see what fits you better.
---
Of course, you don’t consume on a fight you will chain wipe on. Yes MC is pretty silly to not do it since it can put a huge difference into how fast you clear. If you’re clearing Mc in AQ gear you want to be in and out ASAP
---
I can relate. I work as a TA for an elementary school and our summer break starts June 7th and ends mid Aug. I'm going to gameless all summer break and going back to work right when Classic launches Q\_Q
---
Yeah I’m not going to raid much so I’m just going to have fun bear tanking!
---
Good luck healing.  I might try that too.  The down ranking worries me a bit though.
---
Depends on if you’re a male or female nelf. Some guilds don’t allow night elf males.
---
Back in vanilla people generally thought that warriors were bad DPS and only good for tanking. Reality is that in the best raid guilds they typically had the best DPS out of all. Majority of the playerbase just never figured that out.
---
This isn't Classic, but I got exalted with Org at level 51 on my Blood Elf in TBC by spamming AV as soon as I could enter. I rode around on a standard Black Wolf until I got my epic mount and ride the AV Wolf mount.
---
FUCK YOU SCRUB!! - Half the wow player base
---
That's right...Coors light
---
And decurse and cure disease.
---
If you need help you can ask me here or on PMs. Been playing rogue since vanilla at high level.
---
Other than that you can look on YouTube for pvp videos and watch what top players do.
---
To add on to the other comment, Vanilla also had different styles of stat distribution. So it wasn't always, "This has a higher ilvl and therefore more stats on it, therefore it's automatically better in 9/10 situations."
---
In Vanilla you can use certain blue items well into raiding and they will be better than the raid gear. A trinket with 2% crit, and that's all it has on it, is one of the best trinkets for many classes and specs through multiple tiers of content.
---
&gt; I noticed something while watching the streamers. There’s a huge sense of community that classic had that was lost sometime after BC. As much as I adored WOTLK for the gameplay aspect, the community feel was gone by then. 
---
That is something that we screamed at them from the top of our lungs would happen.  It was really frustrating to see any semblance of community erode to nothing in the game that I loved.
---
In vanilla and TBC you knew the people on both sides and it was amazing.  No transfers, name changes, etc.  God, I'm looking forward to that again.
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/46/basic-stats-sheet
---
This is accurate for everything other than spell crit per int.
---
There are different opinions and certain groups of people are going to stick to them since they all have their own truth. 
---
Simply said - it depends on where do you see yourself at the endgame, if it's casual then it does not matter, if you are aiming for something more competetive then it does. 
---
Folks keep on asking if hey "would find a raid" group as a certain race or spec, but nobody usually asks "would I find a **very good** group". 
---
So - coming back to your original question, will you find raids as a nelf warrior - absolutely yes. Will you find a spot in a more hardcore and quality raiding group - maybe, since there could be some implications about this matter.
---
Playable, yes. It's still a Blizzard game, not like some esoteric old CRPG that takes a long time to figure out, and you can accomplish the majority of what the game has to offer as a casual player. Leveling to 60, dungeons, pvp, world bosses and even a PuG raid are well within your grasp. The only thing hardcore about it really is that there's more itemization, consumables and talent optimizations that spark a lot of conversation. And while it does take a long time to level, you can progress in it at your own pace.

What the fuck are you talking about lmao.

Faculty here:  semester starts the 26th, fall class is once a week, on Mondays, done by 4:20.  Live in eastern time zone.  Rest of the week and following Monday off.  Glory be to Blizzard and so sorry for you earnest students.
---
College prof here and OG vanilla player   I drop students who dont attend the first full week and only if there is a waitlist of students trying to get in who are showing up.  Might make exception for Classic players ;)
---
Because every class plays both factions. Except shampal
---
I failed one class in my entire academic career. College Statistics, fall semester, 2004.
---
I used to be a warrior tank main in vanilla but definitely going hunter this time. I like solo grinding so gonna make a fortune with Devilsaur, Maraudon and Dire Maul farm, hopefully.

so does this mean everything just gets shut down for a month in the summer if everyone has a legal right to take the time off?

Just because something doesn’t directly impact gameplay doesn’t mean it isn’t important to some people.  You might not care about it, but that doesn’t mean other people don’t.
---
Tragedy is when I cut my finger, Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die.
---
If you like it in TBC then you'll like it in vanilla. The biggest difference is that you have to get used to switching between auto shot and auto attack manually since TBC streamlined that.
---
You could consider checking out Ebnflow on YouTube. He does extended videos dueling particular classes and you get a good sense of how to play in certain matchups. He has a rather high win rate against Warriors, Hunters, and Mages so far in 1v1s with even gear.
---
i know people will downvote this, but this is literally the case in any game ever. if the game gets popular older players with experience will definitely get outranked by newer players with better mechanics.
---
ZG and ZA were added in 4.1. The hardest dungeons (imo) at launch were SFK, Stonecore, and Grim Batol.
---
That's partially true.
---
You're asking the choir.
---
There's gonna be a Human Warrior named "Asmongold" on every single server the instant character creation opens on the 12th.
---
39 rogue was amazing, one shot ambushes definitely happened! Also 49 ele shammy was very very fun, even though that was in tbc so it was a bit easier.
---
You're incredibly lucky you never figured out private servers then, because those who did have been suffering ever since they became a thing.
---
A lot of people have quit the game over the years specifically citing changes to the game design as the cause. The massive drop off in sub counts after Cata even before Blizzard stopped publicly announcing them is proof enough of this. Apparently those changes have only continued down that path of convenience over immersion. I see a lot of people 'trying' retail once they get into classic to test the waters and failing to find the same level of immersion and socialisation they will with classic.
---
That woman.. looks shady for some reason..
---
Go shadow and queue healer, it'll suffice for dungeons.
---
Don't think anything ever prevented daze
---
I was in a top raiding guild in vanilla  and our main tank was a Nelf Warrior.
---
So, no.

joke's on me, i work year-round.

The classic beta does, it is the most private of all servers it seems :(

Some old wowhead comments made it seem like a player daze affect and the NPC daze were different. But I was thinking the same as you.

Clearly Blizzard has nerfed Rag.
---
Sorry I should have said I was talking about some end game stuff. I made a rep guide recently so I was doing some research for Timbermaw Hold. I actually think some of the quest rep has been updated on classic.wowhead since I did the video which is great. I wish I kept more detailed notes now damn.
---
Here a couple of examples:
---
Deadwood Totem quest 1400 rep
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=8470/deadwood-ritual-totem
---
Deadwood Totem quest 350 rep (TBC values doubled should be 150) http://web.archive.org/web/20071010071532/http://thottbot.com/q8470
---
Old comment from thottbot about quest: 
---
lets make it clear:
---
u'll get 5650 XP for turning in
---
2 major mana pots
---
2 major healing pots
---
150 rep TM hold
---
85 silver
---
I assume when quests are marked [DEPRECATED] means that they are at old values?

Also at Cata rep values? should be 100 each

A Blood Elf? In *my* classic??
---
Nope it's 100% trolling. Not sure what OP was talking about.
---
If you assume a 50:50 split between horde and alliance. Then you need to double pally/shaman numbers (or halve all other numbers) to get the proper % values in each faction.
---
For example based on this poll at the time I saw it 288 / 4744 (~6%) of people will be paladins. However,  if you assume half of those people will be horde (no paladins) then 288 / 2372 (~12%) of alliance players will be paladins. This moves it from the bottom of the poll to around 4th most popular. For shaman this moves it to 16% the same as the current most popular class warrior.
---
Ah yeah fair enough.
---
World first! Dude these are fucking great and they soothe the pain of that 3 month wait. Thanks.
---
Classic will have to prove itself to Blizzard over a period of time. Then they may consider further material/expansions/alternatives,
---
No. Bfa sucks, modern WoW in general, dont lose your money and your time, wait for classic to enjoy a real mmorpg experience.
---
That’s one example, I see your point.

This is incorrect it works off of Honor not how many kills I played on daggerspine in 2006 Kurama was rank 14 for over 12 months straight he just played and won games on a struggling alliance side
---
That sounds tough and like a lot of fun! Can't wait to try it on classic.

I'm late to this post but nice catch OP. Looking at it now it so obvious and one thing I remember about early wow. You would have weird moments where you would think your character would fall off cause of the twists and turns the griffon would take.

Ive been playing WoW classic for the last week and on my first night playing, my wife walked in and said, "oh crap, is that fucking WoW?"
---
In organized raid guilds warriors are a dime a dozen, everyone wants a raid slot and people are willing to do whatever it takes, even if that means tanking. Tanking is also a high responsibility role so guilds will go out of their way to make sure at least those players are competent which means having them planned out likely before they even open the doors to recruitment for a lot of cases.
---
Where tanks are needed is random PuGs, people sit in the capital for an hour spamming LF tank because all those established tanks in raid guilds can easily get 4 guildies to run with them anywhere they want to go. If you are looking to fill a group by yourself, you are also looking for random tanks who don't have other people to run with, and THOSE are quite rare, especially because playing a prot warrior solo is downright awful. You might not actually need to be prot to tank dungeons, but a lot of people don't know that and a lot of DPS warrior mains will not want to even try for PuGs.
---
&gt; I've seem some saying it will fail and be a ghost town within 3 months. Some others are saying it won't even get .01% of Live WoW's numbers.
---
People said similar things about Old school Runescape before launch.
---
They were generally right a bit after launch (population started dropping off since people hit end-game quickly and there were no updates), but then once updates started coming in, the population came back, and next thing you know, the old school version has 2-3x the players compared to the main game lol
---
Proportionally to the other classes.  If 16% of people roll warrior presumably 8% are horde and 8% are alliance.
---
When you look at it that way, paladin at 6% are up there with warlocks and past rogues.

I’m conflicted by this.  Played mage from TBC to now.  Paladin in Vanilla and it always felt weak.  All the hybrid classes were weak in Vanilla, as in just not as good as healers or tanks.  DPS was even more slanted. 
---
Love the pure class assignment angle.  Being a mage for so long, I’m conflicted and considering rogue.  Mages, rogues, warlocks and hunters were always bad mofos in Vanilla.
---
While levelling most people hang out near Stormwind because of the human levelling zones.

Once people hit 60 All the raids and dungeons are closer to IF and also Menethil Harbor.

I played on Magtheridon PvP. I remember being a sub-60 Tauren Druid in vanilla and was on my way to kill some quest mob down a crypt in the Plaguelands. I get down there and a dwarf priest (I think— lower level than me) was already half dead trying to kill the mob. 
---
I’m not a ganker. I never was. I only rolled horde on pvp because my ex who introduced me to the game and his buddy wanted to play horde pvp. 
---
I helped the dwarf priest kill the mob. In turn, he waited around to assist me. We both exited the crypt and a human mage was there too; targeted me and started casting. The priest must’ve said something to him because he stopped casting and bowed to me. 
---
A little while later, as a newly minted 60 in Silithus, I randomly ran into the priest again. He dinged 60 in the zone and I cheered. 
---
This is what I miss. I knew the folks on my server. I knew the names in BGs. I knew that freaking Paladin who camped me and any other horde non freaking stop all throughout BC.
---
A good idea until you want to pull or attack an additional target while keeping the voidwalker tanking what it already has aggro on.
---
Keep petattack as a seperate keybind.
---
iirc MC was tuned for like 25-30 people, so 20 moderately skillful players could very easily drag 20 window lickers through it
---
Man, totally unrelated, but seeing this reminds me of an old boss I had several years ago. He was a member of Syndicate, though I didn't know it when I started working there.
---
When I finally found out, it blew me away to find out that I worked with someone that has been with the guild since the days of EverQuest, and had even played a part in the development of WoW via F&amp;F and Beta access/testing, especially considering that he was nothing like what you'd expect someone The Syndicate to be like.

I kill grays once.

Mages are the dopest class.  Play fantasy game, who doesn’t want to cast fireballs or frostbolts?
---
Problem is I played one for like 8 years.  Definitely not going hybrid.

Naw web dev and motion graphics.  Still though, show up or gtfo, I hate when students show up to my office hours asking me to reach them a week of class   :)

Not if you want a life. Because it’s gonna steal your time.
---
Oh man, that's a great story.
---
This clip is the fucking best
---
I remember warriors being sub par DPS and only great if high end geared.
---
You nailed all the hybrids tho in regards to PVE.  What’s sucks about hybrids is re-spec required for PVP and even solo.  Like Ret pally is fine for leveling and solo content but sucks for anything else, mediocre at best in PVP.
---
Lots of specs that are completely bust and never work (boomkin- prot pally) or just sub par (Ret pally, feral, elemental sham)
---
I almost never respond to shit like this but the entirety of mythic Jaina first phase is random and carries over into her second phase as well.
---
I was a warrior tank back then and kept tanking up until Legion, so am pretty confident in that. Was just honestly surprised since i had no issues getting in a raid. Though the guilds i applied to were on the lower end so i guess they just had a lot of tanks leaving there which made room for others.
---
CaN POSt oN InteRnEt FoR upDOOTS!

That ain’t snow all around Ironforge...
---
It indicates that it is (basically) a new game, people can't actually play it yet, and that it has been released to a lot of the top streamers for a week. Honestly the marketing team has been killing it with this one. This was done for free.
---
Nearly everything we hate about retail wow started in TBC and that is the hard truth.
---
This was a good troll, I applaud you
---
https://i.imgur.com/parrLyh.png

This is what happend to OSRS population after release and Classic wow will probably mirror it as with most new games released look like this also.  Hype for a new game comes out, huge interest by players and then everyone falls off. OSRS let players vote and players only wanted content that was in line with the "Old School" feel. After phase 6 the game will probably die but I hope not. Unless we see content updates not expansions. Why not expansions? TBC was a mistake it hurt player retention. Level 70 and new greens that made all of your work invalid. People stopped playing and just waited for TBC to come out. Was harder for people to pull numbers for content at the end of vanilla. I am for TBC content but not as a expansion. #nochanges will not work in the way that people think. You need "fresh" new content in line with that "Classic" feeling. I hope they never expand the level past 60 or it will kill the game again. They have the chance to take the game down a different creative path with the hindsight of their mistakes.
---
Soo.. each time a new player gets famous, they are forced to move to a different server? Just for a new person to sweep in on the lack of big streamer for that server?
---
Perhaps, but I think the popular opinion is mid wrath is when the game took a turn.
---
Have to bring at least a couple hunters to the raid so just do the most damage you can do and realize you won’t top meters
---
hunter daze and mob daze were different for sure on some mechanics but no idea about FAP
---
i will be fite dirud. Mained rogue in vanilla but feel like there's going to be way too many rogues this time around but still want to play a class than can stealth. People say druids in vanilla are underwhelming, though others say they have they can be good. Whatever.

Hi, /u/Lestoli

It was always possible to get to thirty on quests alone, if they slashed experience in half it would be bonkers.

Now *that's* Vanilla footage I can get behind! Seriously, video capture software SUCKED back then. Fraps was horrible
---
Hunter utility consists of basically tranq shot. Nobody cares about hunters. Their DPS is fairly poor, not useless, just poor... The only other decent thing is fd/Rez, but you have to engineer for that and... It's not a sure thing. I could be forgetting something else they may do, but I think basically everything can be covered by another class, in most cases... Better.
---
My plan is to choose a PVP server in my timezone and pick one based on the coolness of its name.
---
mages have water/food duties. warlocks have shard and summon duties. hunters have food/ammo bs. what is a rogues bullshit?
---
The core gameplay in retail is the issue, no matter how many complex out of the box mechanics blizzard comes up with.
---
Paladin, played Paladin through TBC and WoTLK. I know it won't be the same, but lord I want that sweet T2 and Raggy Hammer.
---
I’m in the same boat my friend... may we push through these trying times together! Lok’tar O’gar, graduate, or dropout!
---
Thanks. Fixed the edit.
---
Hi, /u/Mydogfarts
---
This is actually interesting for other reasons. Several classes have abilities whose max rank is trained below 60. If the spells keep scaling as you level then some classes might end up doing more damage with their abilities than they currently do on private servers.
---
&gt; RemindMe! 96 days "do this"
---
RemindMe! 95 days "do this"
---
That graph is basically exactly how I see classic playing out with the drop, except there will be no rise until new content is added. All the hardcore players I know from 15 years ago aren’t coming back because they have already spent 40 hours a week clearing the content. Half the people on here that are no changes didn’t even play vanilla. 
---
Biggest issue I see is blizzard waiting for too long after the drop in numbers to add content and the lack of interest in the game giving them no incentive to add the content.
---
I see. Somehow I always thought equipping stuff mid-combat was impossible. Thanks for the info, I fixed the edit.
---
hunters certainly use way more than just auto shot, they actually have one of the most "difficult" PVE rotations as far as vanilla goes
---
Wouldn't want my travel time to farm Winterspring rep be any longer than it has to, right?

I haven’t played in like 9 years, just subbed again and I don’t want to play anything other than fire mage
---
According to this poll, warriors will be rivaled by shamans on the horde side, unless a disproportionate number of respondents are rolling horde.
---
Not sure how I feel about that.
---
Classic isn't harder it's slower.
---
Yep, after you and a couple other people mentioned this, I added a little edit note at the end of my post. Thanks.
---
Am I the only one that wants to main shadow priest?
---
Yeah that analogy was rough (the bald eagle one)
---
The real way is that you get ported back to the city / battlemaster location once the battleground is finished, everyone in the group.
---
You will see the fall off of initial interest and then there will be bumps in player numbers during each phase release. Blizzard has lost the trust of the player base and its going to take along time to regain that trust. Hopefully they mirror OSRS team and do a great job.
---
Level 19 rogue twink I cannot wait to two shot people again and build a faction
---
PvP wise 1.12 wasn't a great patch for rogues unless you're confident with most classes and use trinketmenus/engineering well. Generally shoehorned into defending in WSG/AB and are somewhat limited in large group WvW. Still maining a rogue but they were past their prime at this point in classic.
---
what was ur build while leveling as a rogue? also how was the downtime? since i heard rogue has alot of big cd... were u able to clear mob packs or u go 1 mob to the next?

Wow head dot com

Well ok, maybe not that useful with wowhead being overall better.
---
There's some nice bits of information here and there like maps of a few zones and its quests, but it's mostly just nice to leaf through. :)
---
Knew instantly from watching a bunch of Grimm PvP videos that the private server version is correct. Hope this gets changed in Classic!
---
Use brain. What happens when you try to use a potion in form? It takes you out of the form. If this behavior is not in the game then you can simulate with an addon such as LazyPig for the 1.12 client.
---
So the macro works.
---
The combination of all "instant gratification" things such as instant pvp battlegrounds and arenas in combination with flying and every "instant queue" type gameplay led to the eventual death of wPVP.
---
I think you responded to the wrong thread. This isn’t a tip and is actually a bug. And has nothing to do with people being feared through walls or anything.
---
In my experience, I've seen it being sold for a small fortune at the AH, since it's an excellent twink dagger. But you're right: it's always a good idea to check the AH every so often to look for good daggers going for cheap. I'll add a little note about that, thanks.
---
It's been weird for people getting in. My main account got invited a few weeks before the streamers got in, and then my wife got in on the opening day with the other people. She has only played since wrath, mine have all been since vanilla. We are F&amp;F but still it's been weird how the invites have cycled for people.
---
If it’s something that lends to you being in better shape than gaming does, then it is objectively better. If gaming is responsible for one being unhealthy then it is a bad hobby for that person until they can at least learn to balance it with a healthy lifestyle
---
Cross-posting to increase the survey size :).
---
It's an exploit just like wall walking and fearing through walls. They fixed it in next patches and possibly in this iteration of the game for a reason.
---
I had 50 days played as a hunter in vanila, so ill go a little in depth on my class and leave out the other classes for others who has that experience.  
---
As a hunter you will usually not reach the true playstyle of the class untill you reach level 51.  this is where your beast mastery specc acquires Aimed shot, which dramatically changes your rotation and how you play.  it makes your rotation tricky and engaging, second to none.   
---
you can allways try early marksman build and test out some dungeons at level 21+ to see if you like it, just make sure you have the addons needed for tracking your rotation timers.   
---
1-9 sucks, at 10 you get a pet, and suddenly solo leveling goes from bad to the best. You only autohit and do the occasional mend pet to level efficiently, which is exactly how you will be grinding non elite mobs even at 60. so for lazy grinding definitely number 1 in the entire game.   
---
But the true role of the hunter is not really experienced untill 60.  your exlusive utility that separate you from others is the ability to pull, kite AND CC.   you will also be removing enrage from certain bosses.     
---
you can absolutely turn the tide in dungeons if you utilise your kit well, and you will have crucial and unique roles in many raid boss encounters.   
---
if you enjoy world pvp i would absolutely recommend, your tracking ability is basically a horde/alliance radar, and you deal well with stealthers. you can ambush every class in the game, and also escape ambushes from almost every class. remember world pvp is not a duel(which you are good at), and you have a f\*\*\*\*\*\* radar and 41 range.  
---
I can go on, but i want to keep it as simple as i can.    
---
But to summarise:  
---
 hunter is not easily determined early like most classes and is less simple than most think it is, due to key roles showing up later on.   
---
however, since hunters are less gear dependent and the most independent class for soloing, you can also easily level a hunter as your second character if you'd like to have a character for farming and fooling around with, without having gear requirements to do so.
---
A lot of people prefer the older art style, myself included. You think the graphics are better, someone else things LFG is better, and person three thinks Transmog is better. You can't all get what you want.
---
You got a declarative in the first half of your statement, followed by a term with the subjective definition in the second half. Casual means different things to different people.
---
youtube "perplexity"
---
Did you play BC and WoTLK? They were amazing. I think after lvl 80 you do new content.

DPS meters will clearly show that BOAR did all the work.
---
IKR! Anduin has some huge feet.
---
I'm so torn, I played NE Rogue in vanilla, and I learned and loved my shadow meld, but this time around was thinking human rogue for end game raids.  I dont know what to do :(
---
&gt;This is incorrect it works off of Honor not how many kills
---
Wat. That is how you get Honor, from kills. That is what I meant. Vast majority of your Honor will come from kills than from other things like winning a match.
---
YES! This was one of my favourite things about rogues back in those days, I loved that smooth stealth animation, would love to see it brought back!
---
Classic devs are completely different then retails devs btw.
---
A skilled spriest is easily the best pvp class in classic.
---
Keyword there: skilled.
---
The guy you responded to?
---
thanks, now I have eye cancer
---
His macro would take you out of bear form as it's only effect. Mine would take you out of bear form, use the potion, then put you back in bear form.
---
dont remember where back in the day. but when i was playing on pservers i would just search "WoW 1.12 addon's" or something along those lines. then just drop it into the addons folder, it would let me know if it was compatible or not when you got to the character select screen where there was an addon menu.
---
It would be organic because they are part of the eco system. Just like school/uni timings impact on gameplay, so do streamers.
---
Flying mounts can work but they need to have some kind of endurance mechanic that fatigues them and forces you to slowfall to the ground if you max it out. Like every 10 minutes you can fly for a total of 2 minutes on a 60% and 280% is like 1 per 10 as a tradeoff for being faster. That should cover all the flying exclusive spots while forcing people to be on the ground more often than not. There's no reason to bust out the 60% flyer unless you are specially flying since the 100% ground mount would be faster overall and the 280% is just that much better since it's 100% on ground.
---
You're a legend, bro.
---
wow, an *actual* bug not based in foggy memory and shoddy evidence.
---
Bravo! I hope this gets fixed.
---
We're talking about PvP here, not PvE.
---
MC is fucking annoying to deal with in pvp. Fear is annoying. Slows from Mind Flay are annoying.
---
Tell that to Path of Exile.
---
&gt;and queue healer  
---
There are no role queues where we're going!
---
You have to roll out Ahs with phases, so classic.
---
I always feel these polls need a qualifier to separate dps warriors from tanks. I feel bad for always voting warrior when in fact what I wanna do is strictly tanking.
---
In these polls, I always double the % of pallies and shamans to get a better feel of how the ratios will feel for each faction. If you do that, there are about as many shamans on horde as there are warriors!! 
---
To each warrior, a windfury. What a wet dream!
---
FAP does NOT prevent you from being dazed while using aspect of the pack/cheetah.
---
It’s more likely than you think!
---
I’m in USA est coast and have my first week of college starting the 26th. Classic comes out the 26th at 6pm not on the 27th?
---
Lol @ all the people who resubbed to get a "beta" invite.
---
TBC killed wow. The design choice to do an expansion vs content release was the biggest mistake. Raised level cap to 70 and new greens that invalidated all your hard work. People stopped playing and were just waiting for TBC to launch.
---
Level 70
---
New greens invalidating your raiding
---
Flying mounts
---
Arena
---
25 man raids
---
On that last point I feel that they should have kept the 40 man raiding for some dungeons and 15-35 for other content. Also there needs to be some open world dungeons also.
---
So not out now. It's in beta.
---
They might get as far as their nearest 10-20 zone and realize what a pita leveling one is going to be. I have a priest and a warrior on the beta. On the priest I can survive pulling 2-3 same leveled enemies, or 1 enemy 4 levels higher than me. On the warrior, I would be walking back from the graveyard if I even tried. I say this as someone who played a warrior all the way the first time around!
---
Blast Wave is called a "daze" but it's basically an undispellable slow similar to hamstring
---
&gt;I was particularly surprised with this one
---
Heh, I'd probably still take the longer one; -2 minutes vs being able to AFK the whole time. :)
---
Idk if they have two dev teams for current content or what, but ever since MOP (which I regret not playing sooner, I thought the Overly Asian seeming panda idea was dumb at first and didn’t play til right before SOO but it was a solid Expac) it’s been solid exp (MOP) &gt; trash expac (WOD — for some reason I had high hopes) &gt; solid exp (legion, by and large at least some mechanics like no weapons upgrades and titanforging notwithstanding) &gt; trash exp (BFA). Reminds me a lot of the trade off between infinity ward and treyarch development in cod games in that they’re two entirely separate entities making the same IP franchise. The ones in between literally feel like filler they have to pump out to stay relevant but end up destroying like half the user base every time and just making the game more irrelevant. 
---
I think cata started off well with some big ideas but definitely got bogged down at the end with some like quickly nerfed heroics and eventually raid finder, but there was some soul in that expansion at least and it gets a bad rap IMO. The shit ends of cata were only carryovers from end of WOTLK decisions when the game was apparently at its height.
---
What did the warrior tank that clipped inside Ragnaros, the Firelord's model say?
---
I'm on the rag
---
But the head is of an eagle which means it must have an eagle's brain right?
---
Druid tanks were pretty good in vanilla.
---
There's a intro cinematic?
---
Wow, maybe I should go pally instead of priest. That’s a whole lot of priests right there. Makes me wonder if the Classic demographics are going to be entirely different from Vanilla
---
There's definitely two moons in Classic, I recall pointing them out to a friend.
---
Most of us will be choosing a server and making 3 characters 14 days before the game is launched.
---
Yea, Wotlk was my favorite, personally
---
Classic was actually the time when you looked down in awe and wonder at the places you hoped to one day adventure through.
---
Stay on bfa please. Thank you from all of people that are able to enjoy things 😊
---
Image macros-&gt; advice animals -&gt; maymays
---
I swear I remember that too
---
I always play Forsaken but right now I am a bit undecided.
---
I am deciding between Rogue, Mage and Priest... in that order. I played Rogue and Mage in vanilla and my buddy will only play as Rogue.
---
isn't only ghost wolf supposed to be allowed? maybe they fucked up with that
---
Dudeeee same, but honestly it’s one of my fondest memories. Nothing like trying to escape the hell hole that is the BE starting.
---
Is that LoL items on your bar? Haha
---
If a streamer chooses a name no one knows, you won't know what server they're on at all.
---
If a streamer chooses a known name and makes the character across three servers, you still won't know what server they're on, you'll just have a guess 1 out of 3.
---
3/10
---
LUL
---
Yup, however I can assure you that 99% of that warrior number are "#nevertank" warriors lol, so you'll be a special snowflake if your plan is to be one I guarantee you lol.
---
That moment of anxiousness during every class StrawPoll hoping that priest isn’t first.
---
Oh yeah. AQ40 set for ele is absolute nuts for the spec. Easily one of the best sets for a dps class in all of vanilla and going into pvp with that set is bonkers. 
---
I'm just saying good luck raiding AQ40 as ele (most mobs are highly resistant or immune to nature dmg).
---
That's also not true.
---
Congrats! 
---
Man, I wish I could make new friends and clear content like OP could :(
---
This. Any spec is pretty good in pvp...but getting the good gear from pve for the pvp...most specs will end up healing to help the raid as a whole.
---
Isn't classic just vanilla rebuilt in the modern client?
---
In TBC I switched from mage to warlock and never looked back. We can pull off some amazing things from soloing content to saving a raid with our soulstones on a healer or tank. I used to come to raids with two shard bags full of shards, and it wasn't bad to refill it during normal play. Was bad enough I picked engineering so had all those gadgets as well.
---
[Why not ten accounts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR7jW9GG0rM)
---
Yeah I’m curious about how popular warrior tanks will be as just from reading Classic WoW, the impression is Warrior tanking will be more popular than ever. But of course that isn’t exactly an accurate metric.
---
You guys know that it’s possible to play and enjoy both games for different reasons
---
We simply forgot ... until BC came out. 
---
And then life was good again.
---
And then that dumpster-fire Eclipse system came out in Cata and simultaneously every Boomy rerolled.
---
you can easily find a raid group regardless of race. your gear determines your PUG invite chance.  your experience and attitude determines your guild invite chance.   
---
however, if you truly want to min/max for PVE, you should play human as a rogue/fury warrior. the sword skill definitely makes an impact on your autohit damage, and if you are aiming to join the top guild on the server, you need to have a min/max attitude.  even as a tank you will be generating more threat as a human, but you could argue for dwarf racials on some content as a tank.  
---
Dwarf priest is another. you want atleast one dwarf priest as early as onyxia. being a dwarf priest can decide if you get invited to the onyxia raid instead of Billy the night elf priest with roughly the same items.  
---
we can all have the skill beats racial discussion, but in the end a good racial beats a worse racial 10 out of 10 times.   
---
But u can absolutely pick any race you enjoy without any consequences as long as you dont want to be a hardcore server 1st player.   
---
If Night elf is what you preffer, thats a great choice. shadowmeld is an incredible tool to have, and can make your class much more enjoyable for every minute you play except for when you chop down raid bosses.
---
The spell is broken af on pservers. You dont even need to get a killing blow on the same target you Drain. Any killingblow on any mob is fine.
---
Dual spec was a really good addition
---
Think soda is getting one made
---
If it makes them more money, there probably will be.
---
WOOT WOOT
---
What movie.
---
Hmmm I was wondering if I would be exalted if I leveled in Org territory from the very start. Would love to have that wolf at level 40
---
You people as in... the people that don't like the direction retail is going and are excited to play classic? Because that's who's here on the subreddit.
---
Difference is, you're spewing nonsense  because you have not played retail in years, so you quite literally have no idea what you're talking about. 
---
"Retail = bad." Sure, I agree. But let's be honest in the discussion as to why
---
All profs have their perks. Mining/engi is good for pvp. BS/Herb/Alchemy/Enchanting will all help your guild &amp; raid group. Leatherworking and skinning will even help your guild as well.
---
My guild through vanilla had a bear tank, the issue is with these off spec classes is that  that the items for them are hard to get.
---
 I remember him wanting to do ysondre every time the dragon was up for the druid mace that he dropped and never getting it. RIP
---
Congrats. You are the first person to understand a joke. Upvote for you
---
Oh I have no doubt. But I'm still curious to see what my tanking competition is gonna be like!
---
I'm actually going to be leveling as Threat-Prot too. Got my wife with me tandum leveling, me as warr her as a resto druid. So we'll at least get to dictate aby dungeon group we choose. Raiding however will be another matter
---
Yea there will be. That was the answer to why there’s still the ‘Blizzard store’ in the beta build. No token but yes, transfers will be there. Wasn’t mentioned if at launch or not though. I can’t remember who said it but it was along the lines of;
---
It was in vanilla through the website so we’re just going to stream line it within the game as it sucks to roll on a server on to find your friends are on another.
---
&lt;DIE&gt; ?

yikes.

Welp, that's disappointing. Thanks for the answer.

I had no idea SmoothMcGroove played WoW, I've been watching his videos for years, awesome!

Other classes gear scales better around naxx as well so hunters drop off. During MC BWL and Ony though on my hunter main back in vanilla I and another hunter often topped meters without Lupos. Hit or miss during aq40 and during naxx dropped to top 10. Doesn't really say much since thinking back most competition was not probably optimized. They are needed though and bring utility. Kiting on razorgore, tranq shots, wolf howl for melee, situational frost traps were helpful as well (ony / nef whelps / razorgore adds for example). Typical raid groups will run with 5 hunters until naxx and then they just run with 2 hunters. If your tank is not great at threat gen hunters really shine as well but that will mostly be in the beginning.
---
And there's going to be thousands of bugs reported by people who only have retail experience or is trying to remember something from 14 years ago.
---
It's hillarious reading how much salt some people have over private servers when they are the reason we get Classic in the first place.
---
Hi im still on the hunt for a twink rogue. Stabnrun was his name i think....and a warrior female undead....think her name was hatchetface. If you see them tell them ill be waiting in WSG.

It’s mainly showing off their gear. I’m sure any healer/tank combo could clear any 5 man in naxx gear.

You know, wow is a easier version of older mmo's. No xp or item loss on death and general ease of combat.  Retail mmo players have dealt with worse and better.

How do you feel about gear becoming obsolete per expansion though?

Not a bug

When you have to have the same game but harder because the game you made is dogshit normally.

Raiding was meant to be difficult and multi difficulty raids I think drew away the fun.
---
I have a feeling many of us are in that boat. After having many members of my guild quit due to problems in cata we ended up disbanding. I quit very shortly after that happened and haven't played WoW since.
---
Wishing this as well as bf wants to go RP while I want PvP. RP-PvP servers were always my fav when I still played, too.
---
This is the answer. They might hold off for a bit but it'll be there eventually. They even said as much
---
A lot of things here don't add up at all, but I don't want to out myself as a private server player so I'll just pretend like it's legit. GZ!
---
I'd rather camp someone with a big audience than someone who doesnt have that.  the moment i go out to gank or camp i leave my honor behind, so i might as well stream snipe if they choose not the delay.
---
none at all, even with people that'll spout, "why would you not go Dwarf Priest for Fear Ward?"
---
there are certain people that'll demand you absolutely min/max yourself to the nth degree, but for 99% of people, they won't give two licks.
---
if anyone was as confused as me, he's basically saying that he wishes they capped the levels at 29 instead of 30, so they could be spending their beta time truly testing out the 29 bracket, which would be much more worthwhile (since many many people will be playing the 29 bracket) than the 30. yes, its still a fine test because theyre all on an even playing field but why not have them minmax at 29 for a few weeks instead and get some more allaround useful data.
---
&gt; You americans Got nothing Else in my interest. Nice try thou :)

I could say the same about Europe.  The only thing I like there is the stuff that happened 500+ years ago =)
---
I really should not be caring about winning an argument on the internet...
---
Anyways, I took a little deeper look and Stoneskin was removed with Stormblood, and apparently I started playing early 2018, about half a year after Stormblood's release. 
---
I then redownloaded 14 because thankfully there's this 7 day free thing going on, went to the cyclops area, waited, and found a white mage to indulge in me in my crazy ideas. 
---
First they casted Protect on me, then I went sync'd in, which removed Protect, I had them cast protect on me again (they themselves were still lvl 70). It didn't work and I was taking heavy damage. Regardless if I was wrong in memory or they changed something, it doesn't work now.
---
... and then they instantly killed it with Doom. ....
---
I... what the hell. This even worse than invincibility.
---
Here's a link of someone else doing it.

Yea once stormwind had an auction house is when it became a more central hub I think due to its locations more related to the flight paths and boats to travel to other continent for alliance.
---
Scatter, Feign, Trap though!  :)
---
Ah yes, the screen we see right before we get to wait for Shield Wall to come back up. I know it well.
---
Goodness some comments. If it makes you feel any better I found this funny even tho I love both Retail and Classic
---
Do not DOT the Sheep !
---
And there's a bunch of obscure bugs that only got identified by private server players. It goes both ways. Go hate somewhere else.
---
Personally, I don't want people abusing BG queues for free ports.
---
Find me a vanilla video with cast bars that stop mid-cast, then.
---
Dude your post is semi unreadable. Can you at least attempt some kind of grammar check before spewing your stream of conscious brain garbage?
---
A lot of shit content is time-gated now for mostly no reason. 
---
A lot of quests require you to send troops on a mission that is completed after 2-72 hours and you can't progress further in the story until it's done. It's literally a phone app concept and major shit is locked behind it. It was worse in legion but still impedes a lot of progress for playing the game.
---
Time gating has always existed in minor forms throughout the game (i.e. only able to farm so many heroics per day for rep) but now they went full fucking retard with it and a looooot of stuff is hardcore time-gated. 
---
Another example is you can only farm a tiny bit of rep for the new allied races each day since they're gated behind world quests (cancer devolution of dailies). If you go ham you might be able to unlock one or two a month.
---
I played a shadow priest in vanilla and ran in a premade every week. One in a group is totally fine and they definitely pull their weight. Don’t listen to these people. Roll UD, Grab a tidal charm and take 5/5 blackout and melt some faces. It works and it works well.
---
I was the second Mage on my server to get the full Netherwind set. I was known by just about anyone who mattered at all of the major guilds on my server. I got random tells from people asking for advice and to raid/5man. 
---
Now I don't tell you this to show off my epeen, I tell you this because community, reputation, getting unobtainable gear meant something in vanilla. I mean even certain Crafters were well known because they farmed super rare item recipes.  They did so many things right back in the day and your character felt like an extension of you.

Here’s the link.

---
But Wrath raids were the best. Give and take I suppose.
---
Like any form of disgust of frustration is automatically labeled as - "you butthurt/u mad".
---
thats not true, this can become anything they want if there is enough support
---
They absolutely will be. Most people back then who rolled a Paladin probably didn't know already what the endgame outlook was going to be like for them, IE only healing, ret and prot basically meme specs (ret being acceptable but not really optimal in any sense and prot being ok for dungeons), so there were tons of Paladins. This time around, people know what to expect, so naturally Paladins won't be very popular. People intuitively know there's no point essentially setting yourself up for a disappointing experience at 60.  
---
That's where the masochists come in lol
---
As a rogue, timing Vanish to immune that stun and pumping out DPS while everyone else was web wrapped made you feel like a complete boss.
---
Wings out!
---
Well sprint gets better at later levels, making the animation different. Agree the og is better.
---
Making poisons :o
---
Heirloom gear, buy it for your alt or alts (account wide) and it scales with your level all the way up through 120(?). Each piece also gives +5-10% bonus xp, think you can get up to bout 50% bonus. So when leveling a new character you have the same armor and weapons til end game except for a few slots, been awhile so I think bracers, gloves, belt, and boots are the non heirloom slots.
---
Of course, heirloom gear is optional, but the level cap is so damn high it's a drag so why skip on the bonus xp.
---
As a note, Barrens Chat is [included in our Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/discords)
---
stormwind took over as hub in 1.12 when the pvp vendor area was added and they were giving away grand marshal weapons to everyone for honor. but that was the BC prepatch so it was the very end.

Mans gave himself Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker

Stonetalon, southern barrens and thousand needles. Those are the zones I'd compare to redridge/duskwood

"Normalizes" not "drops"

Looks like shamans will be as popular as warriors on horde.
---
Sorry you lost them =( looking forward to making some new ones too!
---
Many postulate that faction balance will lean heavily towards alliance due to racials. If that ends up being true, this will be even more weird lol.
---
I really love this comment in particular because it considers not just viability but also class flavor and FUN
---
Vouch, very great site/forum.
---
Alliance due to racial? But horde had better during vanilla, while alliance had easier raiding due to paladins.
---
Yea If I remember correctly IF was the only ah for alliance. Then they added them to all cities. But this spread out the overall supply of everything way more making it hard to find certain things. Or people/guilds would use money to control the price on items by buying any other sellers out and relisting the stuff at their higher price.
---
3 minute mage.
---
Honestly, the feeling of getting your first good staff in Vanilla was something else. The aesthetic difference from a gnarled stick to an elegant, crystal-tipped staff worthy of a mage... it spurred me on. I was always hungry to get the next staff that would befit a growing mage.
---
Stress test isn't a beta invite
---
Vast majority of players for almost any version of WoW, even on private servers, are PvE players.
---
I'm not saying PvP won't exist, it surely will, but due to the trend of interest between the two, there will typically be more Alliance than Horde due to that.
---
I think it looks way better in the original. Looks like he's moving fast but QUIET, new animation looks like a noisy shuffle.
---
tbh the name of the guild escapes me lol
---
it was on the Lethon server
---
I want the old animations but just I'd like to point out that any Rogue spending more time stealthed than not is not actually playing the game

Well said.

Making you salty.

Except world buffs

Stab, stab, stabby stab stab and you'll be fine

Yeah you tend to have to use 2 or more, they all seem incomplete in different areas lol

A healer for sure. Not sure which, hate the fact that hybrids have useless off specs.

I didn't even buy BFA.

MoP and Cata were trash enough.

Bonus rolls on bosses and world boss kills. You can use a prepurchased currency to get a second loot on the kill. Believe you get up to 2 per week.
---
ya

Graphics check out, must be legit
---
Wait, so each soul shard is a single item? Oh, oh fuck.

I think this is kind of subjective, as far as Im concerned berserker stance is pretty damn strong and so is WW axe

Still has Thunderfury from earlier. Love the attention to detail.

One could say that having patience is hard. Classic needs/fosters patience.

Thank god.

Don't you need your previous enchanting rod to make the new one? But yes, the highest level rod you have also works for lower level enchants.

Charge 1g for portałs, and they come to me. If I have to find them, price increases - starting from 2g and going up.

Wrong. Old animation looks nicer to me, and even if it didn't in someones opinion, there is absolutely no reason to change animations.
---
Yeah but it's a misconception about classic.. it's not necessarily harder as much as slower. Movement is slower. Combat is slower. Pvp is slower..

The classes shouldn't be balanced. They should be like they were. I recommend trying this version called Battle for Azeroth, I hear they made all the classes so balanced that you in fact can't tell any difference between them at all!
---
Oh, now you're just obvious with the bait. Try to keep it subtle. Good effort though.
---
I’m not sure but on privet servers you had to keep the old ones.
---
All polls say that Warlock will be more popular than Hunter and Rogue, but I will believe it when I see it.
---
They are specifically talking about flying in cataclysm, not the beginning of all flying in burning Crusade. Or would you argue that introducing any flying on any continent would then make a few ground travel on other continents as feeling less rewarding or being more of an arduous task oh, because we know there are other places we could just fly?
---
This all comes down to feelings. And I know I will enjoy the feeling of moving everywhere on foot in classic. And because I spend that 18 months in classic on foot I will then enjoy it in burning Crusade when we are allowed to fly there, it will feel somewhat new and exciting.
---
Female orc doesn't have shitty walk animations like the male one though. Also good posture.
---
 My wife and I both play. We both currently play BFA and are both looking forward to Classic. She recently played the stress test for a day and really enjoyed it. I think if you have a hobby that takes up a lot of time the other person either needs to enjoy it or at least have an activity they enjoy that they don’t mind doing separate from you. I do love that I can tell my wife about a mount I just got and she freaks out and is even more excited about it then I am half the time.
---
osrs and rs3 werent separated for like 5 years bro lol
---
It was added in 1.9. Before Classic's 1.12.
---
I do remember skinning the cows in Elwynn forest, but that might have been in tbc or wrath.
---
Besides, people could make the argument for that flying damaged World PVP options, but they really cannot say that flying makes the world smaller. When flight is a choice you can still travel by ground and the world is as small or large as you want to feel it is.
---
Why let other people dictate how you want to experience the world?
---
If it's not trolls it's that goddamn hacker named 4chan.
---
What level were they? If they are higher level players they will see you easier. Also your rank of the stealth skill matters a lot, as well as the talents in the Subtlety tree that improve the effect of stealth.
---
Any azgalorian that was in the guild Retaliation or RIP, yo what up.
---
Oh I’ll be draining the souls of the poor rabbits anyway.

I think this is dependent on which class fantasy you prefer. I say go pally since you like having the heals.

And blinding powder, and buying flash powder, and levelling lock picking. Thistle tea too, if you're nasty.

Niiiiice found the person who actually paid attention in English :P
---
People do love their hyperbole in describing outcomes. It would alter the community but it would not ruin the community.
---
Old one looks cooler in my opinion. Who cares what looks more realistic anyway, the new animation isn't vanilla, therefore it must be changed.
---
Talk yourself out of paladin.
---
You have no valid argument.
---
Play Paladin, they are fun.
---
Im still deciding between druid and warrior tank
---
I don't understand the question.
---
Both classes are going to be highly sought after. Mage are kings of AoE grinding and always valuable, Paladins are kings of healing and always valuable.
---
You say Mage is a safe class as if (healer) Paladins weren't, but they are too.
---
Ya everything cant be good but wrath was still a fun time

No?

Amen

Nope. It's who I am, can't change who I am.

---
But she’s “ pokimane” and you are?
---
Look I get it, it sucks but the world is not fair. Just bite the bullet and hold out till launch.
---
That will actually likely be a huge problem in classic if a sizeable community plays for a long time. Tanks in top guilds will get bored, real life will happen to them, and those guilds won't want to gear up an alt or a new player for weeks before they can get back to progression. So, they will just tell the next best warrior in teh next guild down to join and he's got a guaranteed spot and loot priority in a better guild...only a fool would decline. Lo and behold tier 2 guild now needs a tank, and if they poach from tier 3 guild tier 3 guild now needs a tank, and so on...if you are happy in a medium or low tier guild you will probably not struggle too much to find SOMEWHERE, I agree.
---
Well now we know who has the smallest dick on the forums

Which won’t be easy if you haven’t played vanilla in 13 years.

FIX. THE. TILT.

The 2 in the video are NOT in Naxx gear though.
---
The healer has [corn cob staff](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19355) from BWL Dragons, [Wild Growth Shoulders](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18810) from Majordomo in MC, and [the Azuregos healing cloak](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18208).
---
The Tank has [the Feral Shoulders](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19389) From Chromaggus in BWL and the [1H feral mace](http://classicdb.ch/?item=20580) from World Dragons, and [the strat UD rarespawn cloak](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13397/stoneskin-gargoyle-cape)

I was gonna post exactly this. She is technically testing the new player experience for classic? But is classic supposed to be marketed towards that audience? I would say no. It just feels like we now have streamers jumping on the clout train for the quick views.
---
If you were in DIE you would remember lol and they were on illidan
---
All the hardcore pvp warriors like MN and tribe are playing gnome which is arguably the worst pve race for warrior, PvE doesn't require minmaxing of racials at all because your personal impact on a raid of 40 is so minimal its barely noticeable if youre doing 10% more dps because of sword racial or whatever.
---
Well, think of it this way: you'll be experiencing the same thrill and excitement that people back in 2004 experienced when the game was first launched. WoW was an enormous success since day one, so it'll be worth the shot definitely. A huge, pristine world with dungeons, forests, mountains and deserts to be explored are waiting for you!
---
Okay, think about it this way and maybe you'll feel better:
---
Give you Beta = One idiot is analyzing every frame of Beta.
---
Giving Pokimane Beta = 7,000 idiots are analyzing every frame of Beta.
---
&gt; I mean she has literally 0 game knowledge
---
Judging by how many clips get posted here every day analyzing mechanics to death by you arm-chair Vanilla “experts” and your terrible memories, I'd say this doesn't matter for streamers.
---
That’s a problem. If I’m delayed I’m going somewhere else. I don’t want to be delayed for faction balance. Deal with it or play on another server.
---
&gt; There is no reason to
---
What?  How in the sweet tits of Jesus does this make any fucking sense?  Do you know how many people that aren't interested in BFA, but want classic?  
---
Let's be real here.  What do you really think your $15 a month is going for?  Remaking classic cost almost nothing.  The fucking C team, and some interns, and after it's done, it's done.   They shat this thing out in like a year, and if anything, they're sitting on it an extra couple months, because they want to release it when school starts back.
---
Anyone who says flight makes the world smaller. The world is your perception of it and you can choose to travel by ground.
---
In reality this is not true because we can't help but conflate our perceptions with the experiences of other people, but there it is, we choose to fly.
---
That was some Sherlock Holmes shit right there
---
Or they just camp your main...
---
"Tilted" lol. Just let her have her fun, shes a streamer what do you expect. Its obvious and clear that blizzard doesn't care when you made your account or what you know about classic. It's for advertising
---
Probably none. Or if there will be, it will probably be through a black market system...if they even put one in classic.
---
Blizzard doesn't care, this 'beta' has very little to do with bug fixing.
---
That mage made some bad decisions..
---
You need to have a positive outlook of the situation. You don’t want the beta to spoil your return! At least that’s how I feel.
---
Gold
---
You shouldn't be upset streamers are getting in.
---
We want classic to succeed, and advertising will help that. It just means moire interest and longevity in the game we're all excited to play.
---
Betas are just as much about hype as they are about testing things. And there are plenty of people testing too.
---
I definitely remember Ironforge as the capital back in the day, but on private servers? I set my hearth to Stormwind. People turn in Onyxia heads at all hours of the day. There's always a chance that you leave the city with a fat buff.
---
I will probably start with Ironforge early on, when Ony buffs are scarce, then swap to Stormwind later on.
---
With priest as #3, warlock as #4, and both of them above hunter and rogue, I am skeptical of using these polls to temper my expectations.
---
next time just tag me damn...

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
It's Open Now In Closed Beta
---
But if OP got the beta I guarantee he will sink DAYS into the game experiencing all sorts of different mechanics in different scenarios. Guaranteed come this time next week Poki will be playing Fortnite again.
---
I don’t know how that’s possible. I thought BfA seemed so good at first, and it really did. I told my friends they might have something as good as legion(which was the best since wotlk imo). But once the raid dropped I was already bored with the new systems and bullshit chores they had put in place. Everything feels like a chore in that game, and the fun is just not even part of it. But back to my main point, the quests and lead up at first seemed great. Bwonsamdi is still one of my favorite characters ever in WoW even if I didn’t make it through raid #1. I need a little help from bwonsamdi.
---
Why would you *want* to tank?
---
Gonna go warrior cause i wana try my hand at vanilla tanking, also gotta do it for my group of friends who are all coming back together to play
---
Hunters are 100% useless. 
---
Literal tranq shot bots
---
You arent entitled to play the beta regardless of your game knowledge, time invested or money invested.
---
Maybe you didnt get a invite because your account is flagged as a toxic member of the community, judging by your outrage of a new player reciving a chance to play a beta (a non issue). I could only imagine how you react to players ingame when something doesnt go your way.
---
Don't forget warmog's and randuins!
---
Heck I only missed the start by like 6 months or so and still always felt behind until B.C. came out. I was also way younger and inexperienced and was the first of all my friends that had it for a couple months still after so I was basically all on my own for a while. I remember finding a few newly founded guilds trying to start raiding with ZG when that came out and MC but all the better guilds, and I’m turn players were mostly moved on from those by then. Im sure there will be a lot more guilds raiding more successfully this time around then back then since we will mostly all be starting at the same time again.
---
Your such a fucking white knight lmao, why does a non wow streamer get an entitled invite? Your argument is shit
---
JUST GIMME A KEY PAPI
---
7,000 viewers and dozens of nit-picked clips over a week vs. one lone dude and his terrible memory for DAYS, firing off Bug Reports about health regen rates and gnome sizes.
---
Yeah, I'm convinced.
---
What did the tables have in them?
---
The most important thing that MMOs are missing is a good story. I didn't fall in love with WoW just because of the gameplay or anything else, I loved it because it told an amazing story about characters I cared about.
---
Fighting for your Warchief or your King, being pulled into the lore, caring about the consequences, it made a huge impact on how the game felt. When I first stepped foot into Outlands what kept me pumped was knowing this was all leading up to an epic throwdown with Illidan, what an amazing time in gaming..Nothing else has captured me in such a way.
---
&gt;paying customers
---
That's the only type of customer.
---
I doubt she has an active wow sub before her invite
---
&gt; What exactly is she actually testing if it’s her first time classic?
---
Pretty sure you can still spot obvious bugs if you never played Classic. Buy your stupid logic, no one was qualified to beta test the original release because they had no knowledge of the game then either.
---
you have to play alliance, that should be reason enough to not play paladin
---
Probably advertising reasons most likley.
---
Also i dont watch streamer so your way off on that white knight comment friend, way to comfirm your dispicable attitude towards community members.
---
I'll make another post closer to the event, and can message you np!
---
A good raider brings their own consumables.
---
Honor system in phase 1 is in reference to ranking dumbass
---
Why would they want a disgruntled angry person like yourself providing feedback.
---
And? the 10k viewers for a short amount of time are probably more valuable the this guy getting into beta
---
Enchanting rods didn't become backwards compatible until patch 2.0.1, so you'll need to keep them all if you plan on doing the low-level enchants ever again.
---
They'll all Bind-on-Pickup anyway, so you can't sell them to another player. Vendoring all your old rods will give you 17s98c (total), so it's best to just throw them in the bank.
---
Are you making these with Paint? Highly impressive if so!
---
Subjectively, people have opinions. Maybe you like retro, maybe you like high quality.
---
Objectively, that's a bad animation. It would be used as an example of a bad animation in an animation class.
---
Not likely.. 
---
&gt; On August 23, 2013, Blizzard Entertainment announced that the TCG would be discontinued, and that they would not be renewing the game's license.[4] In March 2014, Blizzard released Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, an online collectible card game featuring many of the same characters, abilities and artwork.
---
Objectively, it's a bad animation.
---
The literal definition of smaller world is a topic people have about flying. When people claim the world "feels smaller" they are not referring to it's actual size, but specifically how their sense of immersion is impacted by having the tools to completely circumvent all terrain challenges. 
---
In the same way everyone getting an item that instant kills any NPC without cooldown might make the game feel easier.
---
Being able to not use it is also a non-sequitur. People having these discussions are talking about game design. If everyone in the game has an instant NPC killer and you simply chose not to use it, that would not make it a better game than one where it just doesn't exist in the first place.
---
As much as I want to play on a realm with streamers and such, I know it's a very bad idea. I'll find a nice cozy server tucked away in the corner so I can actually play.
---
In a week she can't get to 30. She CAN but she won't. So she can test all the spells up to level 20 in different scenarios spanning about max 24 hours of gameplay? Your argument is A. Stupid and B. Off base of what OP is saying.
---
I remember being a rogue and having little to no utility value in most raids. I basically had to beg to get into raids until I found a few guilds just starting off in MC and doing some ZG here and there. But I wasn’t caught up to that point till around AQ. Most of the populated and successfully ran raiding guilds were always full and moved on from where I was once I started.
---
 RemindMe! 93 days
---
I just flew from Boralus to Arom's Strand in retail, and CAN CONFIRM:
---
There is absolutely no banking at all. The Gryphon is completely stiff the entire ride. I wish I was able to screen record to show you all.
---
And we each have to decide if we can truly enjoy where we are even when we know where we are going.
---
priorities
---
lol kid is clearly salty he didnt get his beta invite move along
---
People care a lot more about what happens at the high end level than at the casual level in 2019.
---
this subreddit is full of people who pay for pics of her feet
---
why didnt you shoot at him the entire time he was running at you, seemed like you couldve killed him faster
---
Lucky, my SO says that classic sounds dumb because she doesnt like leveling and plays BFA relgiously as a dress up game.
---
Leveling with daggers on a PvP server is an excellent move. A mage will rock your socks, unless you sneak up on them before they have their shield up and 1 shot them with a sick Ambush crit. (psst, don't be tempted to Cheap Shot, always get that big fat hit on them, it's way more important to get them scrambling than to get a few seconds to hit a couple times)
---
I’m glad you corrected me, thanks!
---
&gt; Edit: it seems to me that everyone is a Pokimane white knight beta. Go ahead and support a non WoW streamer :) have fun noobs
---
That's what OP added to the end of his post. 
---
So yeah, dude's a mouth-breathing incel. I'm glad he has to wait till the end of August. ;)
---
The “just in case my gf will eventually play with me” account.
---
That is the core of the issue with retail. An overt favoritism of convenience over other aspects of the game. Classic isn't convenient in a lot of ways. I think the original WoW designers knew that if you make too many things convenient, the reward system of the game feels hollow, it doesn't feel like you earned anything if you got it all too easily. They knew people would take the convenient route if it was offered over anything else however, it's just human nature to minimize work. The modern wow designers haven't got that insight any more apparently, and the game is worse for it. **The fact that the game has constantly lost subscribers over the years, despite efforts to make the game even more accessible during that time, proves this.** Forcing world interaction by ground everyone isn't convenient, you're right. It's sometimes tedious to run everywhere. But by allowing people to swoop in and out with flying, you break that mechanic of forcing people to interact with the world, you break the immersion.
---
I love barrens chat
---
Lvl 11? It looks fake.
---
I played in the stresstest and I was surprised by how few people there was per layer. I played there with EU ping and I even managed to tag mobs and go to level in under an hour.  If launch day looks like that and that was what the stresstest was supposed to simulate I think you’re in for a pleasant surprise compared to how TBC and WOTLK launch days were.
---
Aspect of the dazed and confused will always daze you
---
wat
---
Not what he is asking. He is talking about the in game items you could have by redeeming a code from the already existing cards out there.
---
I put in my 3 month notice that im quitting my job, youre the kind of casual who only raids normal and calls lfr casuals, noob.
---
Not like you really need to go to class the first week
---
Note: I graduated college when I was 36. I might not be the person to take advice from on this
---
It’s essentially the same thing. If you had a larger mana pool you’d kill the wolf faster. But that doesn’t even matter, my point was that judging a game
---
based on the first minute of playing is ridiculous.
---
False. That is your subjective opinion. It isn't even retro lol. It was obviously intentionally designed to look like how a supernatural assassin stalks in the shadows. The dude can fucking turn invisible, what makes you think he needs to have realistic looking walking. Besides, the new animation doesn't look good, it looks like he's injured and unable to walk normally or something, like he's half limping.
---
There will be tokens.. I think they're just delaying them for a little bit.  If they don't, it will reintroduce botters, hackers, and gold sellers which means they need to hire more people to deal with it.
---
Syllabus week
---
Eh, he didn't play super poorly, just got outplayed real fucking hard.
---
No.
---
The flag buff is a buff on the player who carries it. It would be similar to dots on the target player being transferred when you MC them.
---
Paladins are overpowered in pvp and pve, holy at least.
---
Am I doing this right?
---
Flying mounts are a mistake, yes. Less interaction.
---
Yeah but its ragnaros.
---
&gt; It was obviously intentionally designed to look like how a supernatural assassin stalks in the shadows. The dude can fucking turn invisible, what makes you think he needs to have realistic looking walking
---
Jesus Christ the hoops you are going through to validate shitty animations.
---
Glad ya get another chance to make a new one with us soon :D My 19 Hunter was Twinkertown and my 19 rogue was Javlen. Lol. Deleted the hunter after they added xp to bgs, did a few last ones till he hit 20. Javlen is actually 120 now 😂
---
Who's the BlizzCon Champion and Rank 1 players on Horde side?
---
Thanks!
---
For lack of a better term, Paladins lack “initiative”. Whereas while solo the initiative you can create as a Paladin is very limited, while in a group, it’s possible to play Paladins really well, since your “initiative” is primarily tied to your group. *With* a group, as a Paladin you can create very strong pressure, *through your support*. But you need a group to do this. Alone, you’re basically an auto attack robot with endless “oh-shit abilities”. It’s these plenty oh-shit abilities *coupled with other classes’ initiative* that make Paladins—and those other classes—excel.
---
Paladins can almost never set the terms of an engagement. Basically anyone can successfully disengage and escape a Paladin—even mobs in PvE, if they were programmed to, which luckily, they are not. This just isn’t the role of a Paladin; they don’t force nor excel at violence. Instead, they are near-unstoppable, *fantastic* team boons.
---
Shamans &amp; mages, on the other hand, have *plenty* of solo initiative.
---
You should really consider if Paladins offer the kind of gameplay you want, since you are used to a very different gameplay style.
---
I was originally planning on rolling an ele shaman, but gearing up is a problem until ZG and especially AQ40. I don't mind healing, but it's not my favorite. So, I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself fully until classic had been out for at least a year. Played mage in vanilla. Will be going warlock this time around!
---
So real it hurts.
---
Best of luck on launch with 5k people online
---
Why would you do that to yourself?
---
Ploughed through to get a 9 hour 41 minute time in beta to ding Level 20
---
On pservers this was more like 8 hours, so it's a bit frustrating.
---
Changes from pserver to beta didn't do much to my routing or drop rates etc - but I can tell you what sure did - the fact that hunter pets are so broken on the beta. I spent so much time dealing with agro issues, pet not getting pulled off mobs with passive, pet running back to me randomly for no reason, pet going passive when I moved away from a mob for no reason, Beastmaster armor talents don't stick... 
---
I expect we'll see some better times from all the hunters once a Beta patch comes in to fix it - hopefully soon!  
---
Congrats to Druids for largely not copping any wierd Beta issues.

Sony digital?

Bfa bad classic good

A blood elf with the BFA gear on as well, for shame!

It is worth getting sick for. Just saying ;)

Certainly nobody envies blizzards impossible task of pleasing old players, bringing in new players, and finding new ways to make fresh a game that by its very nature people will play over play and burn out and that burn out will affect their enjoyment of the game and this is something blizzard cannot control. It's a mixture of both the onset of cell phones and mobile gaming and more rewards faster philosophy, right alongside the completely logical notion that the brain's reward system works in a way where the game's tolerance. In order to create more of the happy chemical it needs to be rewarded more and more, hence the changes with each expansion in gameplay and reward to effort design. At the end of Vanilla, some players we're at the point where they felt like they needed more Rewards or more options, so those options were given in burning Crusade. Other players at the end of classic were not yet at that point and they could have played a burning Crusade that had many similar tenants of classic while still feeling a sufficient level of rewarding in their minds.
---
If the game doesn't feel rewarding, if a player does not feel rewarded, they will not play the game. And the fact that the game has lost subscribers consistently over the years is true partly because what you said, but you cannot separate from that the inevitable fact of burnout or tolerance to feeling rewarded from a game because of how much a person chooses to play it.
---
I blame blizzard and I blame myself for how I feel less rewarded from the game and how the game feels less rewarding or fun. Both are to blame but only one I can have direct control over.
---
Yah OP might of went a little far there but I think the point is still valid. It IS tilting to see these twitch streamers who are just chasing views with the most popular game get an invite.
---
One thing people have got to realize, Ret Paladins are really strong in dungeons where there's downtime between pulls to get your mana back, just not long raid fights without TONS of consumables. You can Heal or DPS in dungeons totally fine. Their problem is sustain damage in raids because of those mana issues.
---
They are also amazing for PvP in Ret and Holy, their skill ceiling is incredibly high because of how many utility skills they have at their disposal. Don't be afraid to roll a Paladin.
---
Who said I’m angry? I’m simply saying what I feel is right. There’s no anger involved
---
Huh?
---
Are we not playing on 1.2? That was my understanding.
---
No, just the actual reasons for why it was made to look like that. It's really obvious to anyone who isn't below average IQ.
---
You're the one grasping at straws here, thinking it for some reason was just accidentally badly designed, even though vanilla has many animations that look far better than new animations from retail. Like the somersaults some characters like undead female rogues in vanilla do, actually worse animations in BfA.
---
You need to play on a 4:3 ratio man.
---
But then again, no changes
---
I feel sorry for you friend. Needing to go online and get your agression out on a stranger.
---
Do you need someone to talk too? Everything going okay?
---
Bored? This is why I play rogue and 90% of what ill do at endgame
---
I really hope that they go the way of Oldschool Runescape. They took the old, 2007 version of the game and left it as is for a while. Then, people wanted more, so they started adding in content but only if it was approved by 70% of the fanbase. These updates were often content people wanted from later in the original game's life and new content. The new content was tailored and in the general tone, aesthetic, and mechanics of the original game, however. This made the game stay fresh, while adding more and more to it. It now has its own quests that weren't introduced to the live version of the game, its own items, its own raids, etc, and I'm really hoping classic goes this way. I'm fine with new raids, but make me get nature resist gear, make it more viable for X class to tank this over that, or you fight a fire dragon so mages respec for ice, etc.
---
This argument is dumb though. 10k people watching the same thing isn't better testing than one person encountering hours of different situations and scenarios.
---
You think she’s playing to find things wrong with the game? Or to make extra cash off a widely available audience. Use your brain smart ass
---
Read your link again.
---
What's that say?
---
This one right here.
---
Yes you will be able to play together
---
Not in 1.12 it didnt.
---
Yeah bruh it’s not like Xbox and PS4, computer games you can play together.
---
Yes thank you my butt hole is full of hemorrhoids and my eyes are full of stupid posts please send help
---
1) Asmon and Soda routinely pull in ridiculous numbers.
---
2) People can't play Classic, so they *have* to watch it for the time being.
---
3) The game has a 15 year legacy and has been pushed for for about 10. Of course there's a ridiculous amount of hype ... hype that will die down pretty quickly when most people realise it's not for them and they can't dedicate half an afternoon to a handful of quests.
---
What kind of retard gets so upset over a downvote to comment about it...
---
Pathetic.
---
So is minecraft, but imagine if the devs suddenly redid all the graphics to make them "better", everyone would absolutely hate it.
---
You are literally retarded.
---
Is this fucking 9gag now
---
Be as sarcastic as you want friend. Just don't lie to yourself about pain, seeking help isn't a weakness.
---
You’re a bitch lol
---
I agree with you its bullshit
---
Except we have current instances of the redid graphics that do look better.
---
Pretty much 40 for every class. You'll want to get the lvl 40 talent point because that usually is a BIG game changer for every class in the game. A great example is Warrior. Arms gets Mortal Strike and Fury gets Bloodthirst, the only instant abilities outside of Execute that you get on relatively short cooldowns, it pumps up your damage like CRAZY and feels like a whole new class.
---
Paladin does the lowest damage of all the classes. Leveling is a bitch. You're just waiting for auto-attack. Your only saving grace is that you won't need to eat food because you can heal.
---
Until your guild kills Four Horsemen (arguably the most difficult encounter in the game), which won't be released for at least a year, probably closer to two, you'll be wearing a dress. Most of your other pieces will be cloth too.
---
You can't tank or DPS. Seriously, you just can't. Even after you painfully level, making money is going to be a bitch.
---
99% of your combat rotation will be spamming Flash of Light (rank 4 or rank 6).
---
Your buffs last 15 minutes and can only be applied per group. You'll be casting 32 buffs per hour and many more if the groups are mixed and individuals need different blessings.
---
i think objectively paladins bring more to a raid than shaman
---
tbh if it was bc id go horde paladin for sure but its not an option
---
the only horde racial id consider is undead the rest os pretty meh .
---
Tier 2 paladin is the most iconic set in the game. It's extremely appropiate because until you get Tier 2 your basically a fucking chump. You are stuck wearing gear made for other classes because there's so little plate that is actually relevant to you. Tier 1 is okay but only because it's plate with high stam and some int/str to work with, but it still doesn't make you a threat to be recokned with like other people in T1. 
---
You are a strong pvp healer, but outside of premades no one is going to peel for you and your heals are hard casted so you better enjoy fake casting and dealing with chain interrupts/cc/purges all fucking day.
---
If you want to damage people thats cool but your basically just running at kids like a juggernaught until you have to heal yourself and then keep running again. At some point you'll catch up to people but if you don't have engi and frost oils you won't be sticking on anyone for long outside of agressive bubble use. Your entire goal is to outlive people in pvp, it's simply a battle of attrition. A lot of fights feel like they come down to having to outsmart your opponents by planning ahead and biding your time but in reality it comes down to them being greedy or dumb.
---
You might be thinking about those Reckoning videos where 1 shotting people looks fun, but you don't see the clips of solo pallys getting kited and pummeled by geared casters who's damage you can't mitigate without building sets specifically to counter them. You don't see the fact that you can't mount up or swap weps so your stacks just come from getting your ass beat in real time.
---
Thinking about it logically, is there anything more cucked thank playing Paladin? Everything you bring to the table is utility to enhance your teammates abilities. A mage on the other hand has utility to enhance himself and control multiple opponents simultaniously. You spend all your time gearing up a paladin just to give some warrior blessing of freedom or blessing or bop some casters so they can do all the real work on the field. You raise everyone else around you to glory while they give you the stink eye when you express interest in doing anything other than healing. Just think about it logically.
---
I enjoy seeing the new graphics. Don't remove them, but let people have an option to switch between them
---
We're playing 1.12.
---
It's actually a bit different than just saying "I didn't like it". He goes so far as to say that it's mediocre, which potentially has implications about the people who to choose to play it. If he would have just said "yep, now I remember why I didn't like vanilla" then I feel like that would have had way fewer interpretations and is a respectable statement to make.
---
Played like a fucking heroin addict from Vanilla beta until Cata.  Mid Cata I unsubbed for the first time.  Came back at the end for the MoP release, quit a month later, came back for the last 2 or 3 months before WoD release, missed WoD release due to moving to a new state and not having my PC for a while.  Played WoD for a bit, hated it, quit, came "back" just to level every class to 100 and farm garrison gold leading up to Legion.  Played the fuck out of Legion because it was actually good.  Quit a month into BfA because its hot garbage, came back for a month and realized it was still hot garbage, haven't been back since, like 5 months now.
---
Currently hyped for Classic, but at the same time I want WoW out of my life.
---
PC and Mac versions are the exact same games with exact same servers
---
Exact same situation :(. I was 12 when I started classic and had such a shit computer, it got ruined.
---
Haven't played since WotLK, but have no hesitations diving back into Classic. So glad Blizzard decided to make it. There's still the Blizzard we remember somewhere in there, you just have to peel away the Activision to get to it.
---
/goes to check launcher
---
Because then you're hindering your progress and progress is the pinnacle of WoW. 
---
You could just not use flying, but then you're taking an hour to get somewhere that could just take ten minutes. 
---
If you're taking 10x longer to travel while others are flying around, they'll get more crafting nodes, turn in more quests, kill more mobs and basically get more everything, leaving you left behind in the economy while prices inflate due to people making more gold faster.
---
I cant decide between warlock which I played back in the day or mage which I've never played.
---
I know, I used to trade them and still have a bunch.  That's where the cards came from.. each set had 3 loot cards..
---
If they discontinued them 6 years ago and most have been used.. why would they add them back into a new game that's not connected to the original game?
---
What's the point of retail having realm forums when everything is cross-realm?
---
Animations matter significantly to the feel of the game. Stuff like this, the flight path animations, etc all build to make the game feel a certain way, and thats extermely important to making it feel like classic, which is the entire point isn't it?
---
I've done a few pserver launches, always suggest a few alternative plans
---
Hi, /u/runnbl3
---
I'd love to be in a guild with Ron Gilbert. -_-

I forgot about Pink Attack Bunnies! I was part of Vengeance of Azeroth, glad to see some Azgalor players here.

Reminded me so much about how ones reputation and community mattered since you only interacted with your faction on one server. I sure miss it
---
Listening to Tool 10,000 days album while questing in Arathi Highlands is the biggest personal nostalgia bomb. Looking out at the vast planes while Jambi is playing in the background, just thinking about it gives me goosebumps
---
If you want to, hell yeah! Don't let any of the elitist tell u differently , either, cuz guess what? When classic drops ppl will realize how little fun they are to play with . 
---
The best raiders in the world can't raid alone, *don't be a dick*
---
I don't know where this idea that vanilla was or is this hardcore game. Grindy and different from today's game sure. But it was always a casual game, and we filthy casuals were all over vanilla.
---
/tear
---
It isn't. It's just the way advertising works now - Blizzard doesn't have to spend anything on advertising because all the streamers do way more for them.
---
I don't agree with it either, but it's just how it is. A lot of male streamers who never played vanilla are in Beta as well.
---
Of course paladins bring more to a raid than shamans. It's not even close to an argument.
---
You have to go into your account and actually opt into the WoW classic and Warcraft betas
---
Bingo, the simple fact is that each of us has a different brain reward level while we are playing Warcraft. Some of us get to the end of an expansion and we feel that in order to keep saying we need to be rewarded more or giving more conveniences to notice you find Value in the game. However some of us get to the end of that expansion and still feel rewarded by the game.
---
Those players would be happy with another expansion made similarly to the first.
---
T1, T2 druids are better healers.  T2 set bonus is what made shamans even decent in those tiers.  T3 is where shaman started to gain steam and become good.  Shaman are among the worst PvP healers as well, they don't have the CC of a priest or mobility of druids and don't have any way to stay alive when stunned like both of those classes do.  
---
If you want to play a shaman in classic I would strongly advise going Tauren for warstomp.
---
Shut up ya nerd!!1!
---
Literally my life, 6 year anniversary is June 18th. Already put in PTO time for the rest of launch week
---
Also be my friend
---
From what I've heard Shadow is good enough to heal dungeons until level 60, so get Spirit Tap 5/5 first, then Wand Specialization 5/5, then fill out the shadow tree.
---
Also shut up
---
You get to play until level 5 again! yayyyyyyy
---
It’s a good question with how consoles have wars for cross platform! But yes you can. you won’t even have to switch any settings to play with your bro!
---
Only a select number of hobbies involve physical activity/exercise. What if your hobby is chess? Or making model airplanes? Or writing? You could easily turn into "an out-of-shape useless sack of shit who refuses to enter the real world and take care of responsibilities" if you spend too much time on any of those.
---
Precasting, active consume usage, cooldown usage (if you use it well you get more uses on the better bosses etc.), mana management.
---
Mage does cast more than just frostbolt singletarget, but you can believe the memes.
---
Well, with Pokemaine having access, she'll have several thousand eyes on what she's doing. It makes sense.
---
You need more bags dude.  
---
Also enjoy the accuracy of the minimap.
---
Now why would blizzard give an attractive, popular streamer access to beta? These are the things I ponder about, late at night in my sweaty nerd den.,..
---
That’s a concern for me too. I’m definitely looking forward to BGs.
---
Funny, I mentioned being apart of VoA and then saw the screenshot of you outside Zul’Gurub moused over my class leader (Belaganor) haha!
---
Couple of years ago! No more for me!
---
13 year old hog squeezers would sub to follow their queen around.  it'll make  asmongold or soda's streamer privilege look like a joke
---
Both. Hence the reason we're getting WoW classic. Now then can keep us happy and keep the retail people happy.
---
IF is also easier to traverse with only ground mounts . 
---
IF forever!!
---
Publicity is the key. There are many things that are not fair in this world but it is what it is. She got thousands of viewers so it only make sense for blizzard.
---
You're such a salty mouth breathing loser.
---
It's dumb saying her having 10k viewers is better testing than OP. It 100% is a smart business decision to give her the beta. And yah it's not just Pokimane but I would say Pokimane is the most egregious case. She just sayed on stream "What is Stamina". Like cmon.
---
I just miss when betas were closed and actually about testing the game. I made my account Jan 2005 and no invite.
---
i agree with the concern but transfers were in classic
---
there are plenty of legit reasons to transfer
---
You only have to worry about cross platform when consoles are involved.
---
When it comes to PC/Mac you can play with anyone else on a PC/Mac
---
Decent raiding guilds and better will probably have 1 feral/tank Druid. You’re the 4th tank and a support dps. 
---
Your biggest asset is the raid can gear you out while they gear out 3 other warrior tanks, and that 3war/1druid is faster to gear than 4x warriors.
---
Landro Longshot was added in patch 2.0.1. He wasn't available in Vanilla.
---
Hey let's just invite every streamer to classic beta, even the ones that never played or have no clue! Ya don't invite the people that played on Nos and LH that actually wanted classic! Oh btw let's make it so these idiots have to buy subscription to get in, that we can get free money and never invite them hehe xD  
---
You know how manipulative they are when the Stress Test day they gave streamers priority in getting in, that way the people that weren't invited to the stress never know how much of a shit show it actually is!
---
Hell yeah
---
Then we find that us that you talk about is actually split into subgroups. I will enjoy classic for everything that it is, and then when burning Crusade comes I will enjoy that for everything it is, and so on for every expansion.
---
They are both retail, one is just back at the beginning.
---
You've never heard of marketing tactics have you?
---
It's almost like having tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of eyes on the beta and stress test is more valuable to them than just a few thousand eyes.
---
Warlocks were kings of PvP.  Deathcoil and Fear were very strong.
---
Wand spec first, IMO. Wands are like 80% or more of your damage. You're better off with higher wand damage and less mana that early on.
---
The BE, el oh el, trollercopter
---
i think it's a bit of a stretch to say that this was an insult towards the classic wow community. i mean, it could be, though i highly doubt it
---
they are doing it because its free advertising. Companies pay millions for the kind of coverage the streamers are giving, of course they prioritze them.
---
That said, I'd be immensly surprised if they didnt release a full public beta some time before full release to really test the server load beyond the normal stress tests
---
Gonna check it out now, brb.
---
The testing aspect is debatable, but (unfortunately) monetary benefits and advantages reign supreme. 
---
WoW is consistently one of the top streamed games right now and they definitely want to keep that going
---
Soda also isn’t feral, cat form is worthless in pvp.
---
Sure and Im walt disney.
---
I was talking about 2006 you idiot
---
That’s honestly my main point. Closed betas with an NDA so people can’t actually work to improve the game. This beta is just for streamers to pull large audiences of people who can’t play.. Atleast that’s what it feels like.
---
Stop being salty man, if you don’t get in, then relax play something else and move on. The world is built on fairness, learn to accept it.
---
Yup. He chose poorly.
---
Flying mounts are sooooooooooo powerful. The ultimate power creep.
---
Keep crying about it.
---
It is impossible to not pull aggro from tanks in vanilla with a 2h and windfury.  Shaman had threat issues all the way through TBC.  Earthshock was the Shaman taunt of the time and they only swapped the threat of Earthshock and Frostshock in Cata I believe...

You realise I know people who have played wow for 14 years and suck...  Knowing how to play isn't the amount not time you have in something, it's actually learning while you do something. Players with better mechanics? What does that even mean ?
---
Dang I don’t usually watch twitch but I kinda want to now she’s hot af
---
Careful dude, you might be called an incel neckbeard jealous fuck for expressing your opinion (even though you’re right). I realized early on that the “Beta” was actually just a hype promotion for the actual release in August. Once I realized the odds were never in the favor of the “non-streamers,” I just accepted it and moved on.
---
I really paid $15 for one month of Legion to take the edge off....... haven’t played since Wrath.
---
You know what I meant by retail. It's become synonymous with whatever the current expansion is at the time, even if that isn't it's literal definition. 
---
You can enjoy what you enjoy, that's fine, I'm just saying that adding and taking away options changes the ecosystem of the game. If other players are allowed to do things faster/better/easier and you want to keep up, you have to do those better and faster options, even if you would prefer the previous options and a lot of us prefer not to have those faster/better/easier options as we don't like the changes it made to the ecosystem.
---
&gt; but you cannot separate from that the inevitable fact of burnout or tolerance to feeling rewarded from a game because of how much a person chooses to play it.
---
While burnout, age of the game and real life events for players are important factors to consider when looking at sub count trends, 
---
considering the [timeline](https://i.redd.it/b0j1aag43j821.jpg) of WoW population decline, you can clearly see a correlation between significant changes to the game and drop offs. You have a constant, massive surge in sub counts in the vanilla as well as TBC, then a plateau in Wrath (when a lot of the convenience systems that directly flew in the face immersion started to deploy), the all time high peak after Cataclysm dropped, and then a constant fall, barring the periods of time coinciding with new expansion releases. Excluding hardcore end game content, it is very easy to argue that the game has pandered to complaints even more over time.
---
The projected sub count for retail *right now* is less than it was during vanilla, and it is continuing to fall. This is despite the gaming industry as a whole pulling record numbers of revenue and interest worldwide. Now you can say the sample time for vanilla wow isn't long enough to draw the conclusion that the design philosophy of the time was going to be successful long term, but you don't have proof that it wouldn't have been either.
---
Some people may complain that Classic is inconvenient, but my conclusion based on this data is that even more people will actually stop playing if the game becomes too easy or too lacking in immersion, both of which are long standing complaints of the game.
---
To address your final point, you do have control over how Activision-Blizzard conducts themselves. They pay very close attention to how people spend their money. If you acknowledge the game is longer rewarding and stop patronizing Blizzard, they will attempt to address that loss of profit more than anything else. That's personally why I think this project finally got the go ahead from the bean counters at ActiBlizzard. They realized that their design philosophy over the years has deviated significantly from what made the game popular in the first place and that Classic is a relatively cheap way of getting back to their roots and attracting that fervent playerbase once again.
---
The only thing that makes me salty about this beta is the non-wow streamers that have access.  Like the people who haven't played wow in several expansions.  Chances are most of them just know someone at Blizzard but regardless.
---
Yes. I understand the concept of advertising. Did you read my post?
---
How much faster are the stealth runs compared to normal ones?
---
Yes they are giving influencers beta access. No one batted an eye when Quinn got in. Destiny was playing for the first time ever two nights ago. This is the ultimate free advertising for their game. Not only do they get viewers from the league, apex, pubg  and fortnite sections from pokiman, destiny and shroud and other streamers they get the ultimate advertising of people genuinly having fun. 
---
Getting influencers who havent played the game also has the benefit of showing how accessible wow is to first time players. It's literally a no brainer for blizzard
---
Odds are you weren't going to receive the one invite that went out to a streamer like pokimane or destiny. And the thousands of viewers they bring in live and the content they create helps advertise and create hype for the game to bring more people back for launch.
---
We all want to play classic, alot of us would love to be in beta but guess what I dont bring 8000 viewers and millions of social media followers around with me. Get over it.
---
You see, you don't have to spent half the afternoon. Why does everything have to be fast paced?
---
I don't even agree they look objectively better, but even if they do, I still think it's better to not tamper with the old graphics. Again, I'll use the minecraft example because it has absolutely shit graphics, and yet, that art style carries so much about how the game feels to the players. Modern wow looks good in its own way, but it's very different.
---
Imagine if people wanted OSRS to be updated to RuneScape 3 graphics. I mean, of course they are "better", but they aren't better.
---
Benefits of being Canadian. My fall semester starts on like September 6th!
---
I don't think they have even done a FF invite yet because I certainly am not in the beta
---
Casuals will need wayyyy more than 8 days lol. 8 days is like casual speed leveler speed. Actual casuals will take... Month(s)
---
lmao I love how the quality of his drawings get better after each one
---
Good thing that I love to tank then!
---
They're not only important factors but they are factors that are inextricably woven into the fabric of the game and gaming experience. Game change dislike versus burnout is an individual question for each of us
---
Such is the fate of any subreddit of a game in a closed beta. There are a lot of unhappy people that can only watch the game on twitch until August 27.
---
&gt;OMG we just kille.....
---
&gt;You have been disconnected.
---
&gt;Position in Que: 92,354
---
&gt;Estimated time:Calculating...
---
It isn't just about advertising. With thousands of eyes on the beta, there will be more bug reports than one person running through the beta, therefore more bug reports and more chances that a bug will be reported.
---
Is there any confirmation that the same realm names will appear in Classic. I can only imagine the nostalgia that will come back to players joining their old servers and making a character they were known by...
---
There were heaps of resources on the forums for certain pservers (such as that closed by blizzard and it's immediate successor), easy to follow guides by class. Seek them out.
---
No offense to some of the links posted advice but if your pre raid BIS requires a lucky random affix roll from a 245 Engi blue, 300 Tailoring, multiple high value BoE epics and rank 7 PvP gear... Then it's not very practical and you'd be better off just doing MC in greens.
---
I’ll have engineering grenades too. The extra stamina will also be useful. I’d just rather have an ability I can always depend on. Plus fuck gnomes. I’m guna sit on they tiny asses.
---
Stonetalon sees a lot of this, its long and thin. One or 2 alliance 60s can basically hunt down all lowbies easily. Also the Retreat is sparsely guarded by NPCs and I remember seeing rogues gank in the town itself.
---
Started following kala, enjoying his content.
---
Aren’t most big streamers alliance??
---
OMG a multi billion dollar corporation taking steps to increase hype for their game? No way! Chill out, dude. You sound like a 6 year old girl who didn't get their way.
---
Fuck. Mulgore.
---
Plus with a streamer there is video evidence of the bug that i'm sure is extremely valuable to Blizzard. Players can clip from the stream, show exactly what the issue is and see exactly how each mob/quest/interaction is acting and exactly what the bug is.
---
The only thing that makes me salty about this beta is the non-wow streamers that have access.
---
TBC had better class balance, good raids, good dungeons but having separate dungeon difficulties was not good, and flying was a bad thing. I still think Classic was better overall because of what it brings in totality.
---
If they went in and made new spell animations, wall textures, mob skins, armor/weapon skins that are less a reimagining and more an upgrade like scbw &gt; sc remaster. (So Cata and beyond models wouldn’t work, I’d want old skeletons, higher resolution). Then maybe. 
---
But if they were to stick new modern WoW models, textures and animations it’d feel VERY out of place—especially for those of use with memories of 2004-2006.
---
Except its not dumb. this is a subjective opinion. you assuming one of her viewers isn't more knowledgeable then this guy?
---
Something tells me this is the dude that's been screaming wow is dying since cata. sorry to tell ya bud but it's still here
---
Omar said in an interview they dont plan on doing that, and the reason they chose a small beta is so the people that wants to play, get their first experience in the reason version and not the beta. Also they didnt feel like they needed at big amount of players since they are not looking to tune the classes/dungeons/mobs and suchs, since they are already tuned.
---
Call your university make sure they know it cant be fall semester because summer goes until September and you'll be there bright and early after your "classic summer".
---
How do you solo farm corpsemaker? Don't the ads have ranged attacks?
---
As if you would care if you had been invited. That is what is laughable about these posts because the real motive behind the little dissertations about who SHOULD be invited is obvious. It’s about you. Nothing else.
---
For someone that just jumped on the classic wow bandwagon recently and that has no clue about the game, I suggest you stop spewing your nonsense on the subreddit, thanks.
---
I do know what you meant. But there's no reason not to expect blizzard on at least a portion of the classic servers to move forward from expansion 2 expansion as they did the first time around. A portion of the classic servers to move forward from expansion to expansion as they did the first time around. Maybe they will have other servers with other content options, but no doubt part of their decision to move past classic will be based on looking back at how much more popular burning Crusade was then classic, and wrath beyond that perhaps. All that popularity happen in spite of Blizzard deviating from classic design philosophy.
---
For sure I'll be curious to see how they handle it
---
A guild recruiting for classic?
---
*Now*?
---
I am sort of in a same position (28 now, wife and a son of 1 year). 
---
But with time my mindset also shifted to be less competitive given the amount of time I will be able to spent (6 hours a week, maybe more on the weekends). 
---
Instead, I will just slowly progress throughout the game and not rush it as I used to do. 
---
Realistically it will be very hard to do any serious raiding progression but there's lot's of other things WoW has to offer.
---
Keep in mind this is not faction-based. Divide the numbers for the other classes by half, assuming equal distribution per faction, and you see Pally/Shaman will have fairly high representation.
---
I feel that might be hard logistically for them to be able to do that. Since they were physical products with digital keys sold nearly 15 years ago and bringing them into today’s environment. idk how true the statement they made was but when they were first deciding to go back and do wow classic i though blizzard said the earliest backup of a client for for classic they could find like v1.12 or something?
---
Sorry, yeah, I meant "casually leveling" by experienced players. Playing like a casual, not minmaxing.
---
lol sorry but it doesn't take anyone 10 hours to get to 10
---
Blizzard is a dying company, literally if classic wow fails they will be done. All of their games are dying, or dead.
---
Yeah totally impossible to do a side by side and get heights correct.
---
Place all races against a wall, in both clients. Side by side.
---
Measure.
---
Not hard.
---
Reminder that the towns, cities, houses in vanilla pvt servers were literally baked into the map, its not like they had to rebuild all the locations.
---
You guys are acting like its all rocket science.
---
It hurts how much you guys are licking blizzards assholes.
---
(ps no you wont get a classic beta invite because you do)
---
Next up: "Objects and houses in Private Servers are the wrong size!!!" -No actual proof provided just "BUT BLIZZARD CANT BE WRONG REEEEE" like 90% of all the apologist buttsucking posts on here.
---
Simply questing in Wetlands and Swamp of Sorrows were a pain in the ass as a gnome back in the day, because they had to swim in every puddle. Now htey dont. I guess its just magic and nostalgia bugging with our collective brains. 
---
I like how most of the blizzard toesuckers in here probably never played wow &lt;2010. Heck Id say less than 1% of all people in r/classicwow played in &lt;2006 and cant back it up (account management -&gt; transaction history)
---
Calm manner? Nice alt account bro
---
Keep tryna my classic forums
---
I'm fairly certain the world record 1-60 is like 4 days and 20 hours, no way you are going to hit 60 in 5 days lol.
---
I think they should just tone it down, a lot! There is no reason for such a large jump imho
---
My 2004 account got access. My wife's 2005 account didn't. We both only play for 6 months at a time twice an expansion. 
---
I'm sure theres a random element to it, and while I dont understand streamers for MMOs at all(watching mmo combat is kinda boring), it's free advertising and honestly that's okay to me.
---
Shes honestly doing more than I am right now. 
---
I don't understand peoples' hard on for a beta for a game we played before when your characters will get wiped in 2 months. 
---
I've noticed a particularly heavy amount of bitching about this streamer in particular and I dont think its just her being a noob(but noob feedback is also valuable so...)
---
Someone's a cata baby.
---
Nice name.
---
Expansions are not the way to go.  For one, it splits the community.  Secondly, the more expansions we have, the closer we just get to retail again.
---
Ahhh i see. Yea being able to cut xp off was nice...then they ruined the twink game. Could still do it but only for the duration of leveling. Im so amped for vanilla. Rolling holy pally though...but then ill do like warlock or somthing. Dint really touch on locks
---
Just show up to syllabus day and play in class! That’s the beauty of classic if it worked with dialup it’ll work with school WiFi! ;)
---
Nah, took me 4 days 2 hours to get to level 42 when I was 12 years old. Level 43 is pretty much dead on the halfway point for xp to 60. If a 12 year old is on track for 8 days, without knowing any routes and just leveling in appropriate zones, 1-60 is not gonna take more than 8 days.
---
Aim for about 10days played and you are doing pretty good
---
I think I spent the first year just socializing in Goldshire and some of the other lowbie areas. Making friends. Spamming BGs. Darkmoon Faire. I never got past level 50...after a year or more. I had tons of alts across many servers. Man, it was great. I played from the release of BWL to the first week of TBC. The whole AQ mat farming thing was epic, my best friends cousin got the black beetle mount that only dropped once on the server. 
---
I came back for a few weeks when WotLK came out, played for a few months again when Legion came out. But nothing has me as excited as I am about Classic.
---
You:

&gt;  you might be called an incel neckbeard jealous fuck for expressing your opinion

---
Why is he a bandwagon? Cause he didn't play on private servers?
---
'How do you heal up between fights, Do you just wait?' said a friend of mine.
---
I find it funny that as a healthcare professional you're aiming to be 60 in 5 days played 🤣
---
I never said that they wouldnt or shouldnt move on to making more content whether that's tbc or wrath.
---
There is a such a thing as reflecting on the past. At the time those things were fun, but were they the reason for the popularity, or was it that it just gained more traction over time because more people found out what WoW is and it became more mainstream overtime? Did flying directly contribute to the popularity of TBC or was it other things? There are a LOT of factors to consider here and I think you're thinking a little too basic here.
---
Stopped playing mid bc.
---
Name checks out, as they say.
---
I have a feeling that many people will be disappointed, then.  I can use both Warlock and Priest as an example.
---
For Warlocks, they will need to be waiting months to truly be seen as core DPS in a raid comp, as they will be used in T1 and quite a bit of T2 mainly for their stones, curses, and summons.  While a warlock is very decent at world pvp, an ally lock facing an undead with a PVP trinket will have a hard time winning a 1v1.  They are the worst performers in BGs pretty much up until Tier 2-3, as well.  If someone is rolling a Warlock based upon Phase 5+ of classic, they very well may get frustrated with the class long before this happens.  
---
As for priest, it is a case of "with great power comes great responsibility".  Yes, you will be desired for raids, but you will also be expected to perform well in your role.  Druids have innervate, shamans have totems, and paladins have blessings, but a priest has nothing to fall back on if they find themselves struggling.  
---
I am hoping that most players are wise enough to just be the class they enjoy playing the most and instead focus upon how they can add value to PVE content and utilize their PVP kits instead of trying to jam a square peg into a round hole.
---
Kill em one at a time and fd first
---
But we know burning Crusade had more players than classic and wrath have more players than burning Crusade. We can't just say that we don't like moving on to burning Crusade because we know that battle for Azeroth is 14 years down the road lurking like some creepy thing. Or at least I don't look at it like that, I look at each expansion as its own thing and judge it based on its own merits
---
Then again I don't have an icky opinion of retail
---
Something very important that I didn't discover about Hunters until recently, you can get like \~40% MORE DPS by walking in and Raptor Striking between your shots rotations, it's incredible how much damage I was missing this whole time. They are lower middle DPS just ranging, but they can get upper mid/lower-top if you walk up and smack a bitch a few times, quite surprising.
---
Its actually bugged at the moment. Was just tested on Stormx stream.
---
Haha I was in VoA at the end of vanilla! Mostly janky stuff in world pvp I don't remember raiding with them thou. I joined with Forseti and Rambozo
---
I don't even try to consider the factors because I fully admit there are far too many and far too complex for us to State any hard truths.
---
Same. All else aside, I'm excited to get my old talent trees for my rogue back.  I forgot what xpac they took those away but it really hit hard not being able to customize based on my playstyle.
---
1 microtransaction in vanilla and im out tbh
---
Even with T3 gear soloing dungeons in Vanilla was very difficult. Depending on your class choice, you either suffered from low DPS, low healing, or low survivability. A group of 30 elites can melt a lvl 60, it's not like it is now.
---
Well, yes, that's how low player count betas usually work lol.
---
What has that do with my statement? Prove me wrong, oh wait you can't. Diablo dead, HotS dead, retail WoW dead, OW dying, SC dead. Only game I'm unsure about is HS.
---
I'm going to be paying $15 a month for Classic.  Loads of people are.
---
Hunters max DPS literally relied on them weaving in melee attacks with their shots...So you are completely wrong.
---
This is probably the only thing that makes me salty about beta.  I don't even know how much I would play if I got access but seeing IRL or Just Chatting streamers have access bugs me.

Blizzard's not going anywhere dude, but keep thinking that. You sound very salty.

Trading yourself food and water every day would save me a fortune and a ton of time over the next couple years.

6 days then?   haha

the point being i'm hoping for 0 downtime and clear direction from 1-60
---
i failed my first 2 semesters, took a break one semester and came back this past semester (2019 spring) and passed everything with good grades. your story inspires me! thank you
---
Nice strat to dodge valid points that I made.
---
those thousands of people dont have access to the beta so cannot report any bugs...you are joking right? those thousands of people could be having their own experiences reporting their own bugs in their own unique playthrough...
---
what?

I feel like all the videos I see of him and his "big plays" are just people making big mistakes. I don't like his attitude nor do I find his videos a display of skill.

Step one. Poop sock. Step two. Additional poop sock. Step three. Auxiliary poop sock. Step four. Backup auxiliary poop sock.
---
On a serious note in that amount of time roll a druid instead. They're fast as hell and basically rogues with limitless resources while leveling. 5 days as a rogue is absolutely not possible without being powerleveled by a higher level toon with exploits.
---
Am I supposed to feel sorry for kids who get the whole Summer off?

I will never bit upvote icefoe
---
About what dude ?
---
Well... it is a hard truth that flying makes the world feel smaller for a lot of people and that flying creates a situation where if you want to experience the world without flying, you're hindering your progress compared to those who are using flying.

One more little gank mercy

Racials had a much larger impact in TBC than Vanilla. Horde racials are better in Vanilla for PvP and PvE, but MUCH MUCH better in TBC. In fact, in TBC, you could only reliably DPS as a Ret Paladin if you were a Blood Elf because only BE Paladins had Seal of Blood, which was an INCREDIBLE DPS seal that sent them near the top of the charts, especially in Sunwell. Meanwhile Alliance Paladins got Seal of Shit.
---
Keep being a delusional fan boy. Hard to look at facts when you are blinded by your own ignorance.
---
Speaking of leveling fast. If the starting areas are insanely croweded (depends on what finalized layering looks like), Do you guys think it will be faster to quest, grind mobs, or go for exploration xp?
---
Well played Blizzard!
---
Your second statement is correct, but the first is not.  A Tier 3 Warlock is pretty much a PVP god, but they are one of the worst (if not the worst) BG class in the game before this due to a lackluster burst (pretty bad spell damage from gear until T3).
---
In world PVP, a Horde lock can cheese a lot of wins with fear, dots, and coil, but an ally lock relying on it vs WotF and a PVP trinket is going to have a very hard time.
---
And if Classic were a standalone sub, it would be like $5 a month.  Even that is highway robbery.
---
I want a modern mythic raiding experience, Bc dungeons, bc attunements, vanilla leveling, vanilla world, vanilla itemization, Vanilla economy, I’d like to see the debuff cap removed and I’d be okay combat rotations from the Bc-MoP eras—but could also stay with the simpler vanilla combat abilities. 
---
I think all classic needs in terms of content (beyond retuning the current raids to actually need consumables during progression) is a post naxx 20 man aimed at being a difficulty between AQ40 and Naxx. Make the sets Aimed to help make the “meme specs” raid viable. The aq40 sets are a start, but they don’t get ret, spriest, ele, enh, balance, or feral close enough to pure dps to be truly viable. Put something in the balancecset that makes sustained starfire spam not zap your mana. Add a decent bit of arcane damage mp5 leather gear, etc. for all specs. 
---
It would follow the same release theme as the rest of the release as 20 man’s are added to help make harder 40 man’s easier and rock bridge the gap to the next harder 40 man (zg helps mc raiders get to bwl, aq20 for bwl folks to get into aq40...we need a raid to help aq40 bros into naxx) 
---
This would not only flush out off specs as mentioned, but it would help solve the gear inflation problem. Adding a late game dungeon on par with bwl/early-mid aq40 that requires only 20 people will dramatically raise the servers gear floor, making full t3 not nearly as scary. 
---
It would also create an entirely new endgame meta, allowing a new generation of theorycrafting.
---
I take 1-2 weeks off every single expansion launch
---
Mom!  Diarrhea!
---
Lol maybe for an edgelord like you. It’s cool though, even the adversarial element of the 2 factions was way more meaningful in vanilla.
---
That's the definition, I asked what made him a bandwagoner
---
World PvP
---
God Tier: Hunter Rogue Spriest
---
Literal Shit Tier: Warrior
---
Sure man.
---
Hey let's just invite every streamer to classic beta, even the ones that never played or have no clue! Ya don't invite the people that played on Nos and LH that actually wanted classic! Oh btw let's make it so these idiots have to buy subscription to get in, that we can get free money and never invite them hehe xD
---
The outside of dungeons used to have Elite mobs patrolling the entire thing, getting INTO Uldaman took almost as long as the entire dungeon itself.
---
This.
---
Also, the vanilla smooth animation looks better, too.
---
You know your resolution sucks when all you can see of the boss is half his hammer. :V
---
Piss off?
---
Ret is fine, just don't play it like a Warrior or solo-hero and you won't have delusions. Being able to freedom/cleanse/BoP/LoH/etc. teammates is as much fun as dicking enemies directly.
---
Launch is on my 25th bday so I'm taking that whole week off. Thanks for the timing Blizzard.
---
You cant open the floodgates for hundreds of thousands of people to experience the beta because then you kill the hype. Blizzard has told us that they pay attention to the forums and social media, including bugs that people are reporting from streams. That's how the stoneskin bug got found out because someone outside of Blizzard was able to see that Joana took less damage after grouping with a shaman with stoneskin totem and they were informed outside of the in game bug tracker.
---
Blizzard reads other forums. They definitely read this sub and other Blizzard game subs. They've admitted as much in the past. Just because you aren't directly reporting a bug to blizzard doesn't mean that a report here doesn't get seen.
---
I mean you did see the fake blue post about having twitch and cleavage getting you in right? Unfortunately it was actually true.
---
People will still flag up for big pvp battles. The temptation to join in will still be there. The only difference in my opinion is ganking.
---
Poki has a large audience.  Blizzard would be stupid to turn down the exposure.
---
You guys are so incredibly insecure on this sub. It's hilarious
---
And at some point I could see the realms they were just incompatible
---
&gt; Holy Paladin all the way!
---
At first I was annoyed that Paladin wasn't higher on the list... but then I remembered that it's better for me if demand outstrips supply.
---
Roll your priests and druids, fools!
---
I loved baiting interrupts with a hearthstone, caster bars put an end to that years ago.
---
its a very weak class, dont lose the game at the character creation screen ;)
---
Agreed.
---
Really, it depends from player to player. I played up to Mists, and still consider Mists to be my favorite expansion. WoD came out, and me and my buddy went absolutely hard in the paint for about half of the expansion, then it got stale and we stopped. Then Legion came out, we maxed our characters and had a great time of it, but just slowly fell off. Neither of us, me a player since Classic and her a player since WotLK, even own BFA. I know she's just not interested anymore, but I can't get over the global cooldown changes; played a buddy's account for a bit to get a feel of BFA, but I just really can't get over those cooldown changes
---
Not sure what you mean by interest and longevity, this is made for the the classic private server players and the old foggies who are tired of BFA or want to relive the old times. Most casual players will join and quit before max level and streamers actively hurt servers communities that they are on, Classic also has a pretty set longevity as we know all the content that we will eventually have access to. It will be great for about a year and it will probably die off after that leaving only those who enjoy leveling casually or want to struggle to muster 40 people together to raid the same content for the 20th time.
---
" You cannot even have a ranged weapon and a staff/sword/... equipped at the same time. "
---
Unless you were talking about in retail you can't equip both at the same time, because it looked like you were saying in Vanilla you could only have a ranged weapon on.
---
how have I never seen this? Fuckin hilarious.
---
Because not everyone is a casual player
---
try 60
---
Is this on an account that was linked to Battle.net?
---
Im not sure why anyone would care why streamers get into the beta. 
---
I dont know the exact number but there seem to be at least 20000 individual players that are being invited to the beta. Probably even more. 
---
I dont understand how inviting like 100ish streamers to the beta is hurting "productivity" or the "effectiveness" of the beta lol. Its obvious why they invited streamers, you even figured it out. Not sure whats bad about it.
---
Ret paladin all the way
---
Streamers are free advertisment
---
The stress test was a stability test of the servers there was no priority given and all you were expected to do was try and log in and flood an area with alot of players.
---
Playing on a Private server isn't an arguement to how deserving you are to enter a beta also its ToS
---
Paying for a sub for a chance at a beta invite is basically a gamble on your end that you chose to do and the odds were already against you to win that gamble, it wasnt manipulative you decided to do this on your own accord.
---
If you know the definition then why are you asking me still why he is a band-wagoner? lmao you good? Let me break it down for you, he is someone that is only here right now because wow classic is the new 'popular thing'.
---
He's calling other people toxic when his NAME IS LITERALLY ISTOXIC
---
Oh boi are you in for a disappointment. There is no quest arrow. There is no guide besides "read what this person found" unless they streamlined it
---
Yup. And i mean that was how it was in Vanilla. But it was a huge pain. I was really hoping they would change that.
---
Ofc i was talking about retail .... only know because i was given some playtime ( of which i played 10mins before quitting )
---
Shop it out IceFoe
---
In terms of the numbers it is doable, 5 days without sleep isn't unheard of. I'd be impressed as balls if anybody did it without drugs though, simply due to the productivity nosedive that occurs with sleep deprivation.
---
I know with all the fast moving and densely packed mobs in Strat.... youd probably do it faster with a normal group set up than trying to stealth, also druids weren't good tanks really until they effectively overgeared an encounter by a reasonable margin anyway...
---
Your opinion is wrong, and I really hope they fix this.
---
I hope you don't get beta just so I can keep seeing these posts
---
For your race specific mount, you don’t need a particular rep to purchase the mount. The only benefit is that you get 10% discount. 
---
If you wanted to get a Kodo, for example, you would need to be exalted with the Thunderbluff.
---
It's literally just slower paced with some more grinding thrown in.
---
They removed stopcasting from macro and the addon API fairly early. I think it was a hotfix post ZG content patch.
---
Lol what "select criteria"? Having a sub is within all of our grasps.
---
People like this make me hope they invite another 100 streamers out of spite
---
I genuinely don’t understand how someone could consume so much soy that they voluntarily play Alliance
---
I would say that's vastly different if the warrior is supported.... if you're with a good priest-healer who knows how to dispel you then the warrior becomes a dammed dangerous killing machine.
---
I’m avoiding all 3 hybrid classes.
---
Rogue or Mage probably.  Then alt holy priest or warrior.
---
lmao blizzard is def not going anywhere
---
Is gurubashi really only 8 min though? I assume you're talking from orc starting to ratchet to booty bay, still seems more than 8. 
---
Def still worth the gold though.
---
I played since 2006 and never played alliance. I think it would be refreshing to see the other perspective and leveling zones.
---
Sure, after 280 hours played
---
I’m on shrooms and I’m busting out laughing at these posts
---
just spirit rez then. Also if it makes you feel better, they probably got ganked and camped too at some point.
---
[Here's a video from a rogues pov on the 1.11 test server back in vanilla.](https://youtu.be/_uJ09ZDG-qc?t=451) Watch a geared ret beat rogues left and right. My experience from vanilla was that paladins are very dangerous opponents for rogues and warriors 1v1.
---
Oh nice didn't see this disregard my other comment.
---
You armchair devs grossly overestimate your importance in these betas.
---
And if you don't understand why game devs would want to give beta access to famous streamers I'm not sure what to tell you, bud... she's a VIP in the industry, you're not.
---
How can you simultaneously say streamers hurt the server they're on and no new players will play?
---
I'm not denying a big steamer can negatively impact a server, they can and will and I intend to steer clear of servers hosting large steamers like those of the Classicast.
---
The first time I had a max level character in wow was MoP and I'm excited for classic and want to clear all raid content. 
---
Just because you didn't play vanilla doesn't mean you don't enjoy older styled games or MMOs. There are certainly plenty of people that could potentially be attracted to this game via streamers, and more interest means a higher chance at blizzard continuing to give us stuff like this in the future, whether that be TBC servers or something else entirely.
---
ya its business whats ur point
---
Calling them valid does not in fact make them valid. Bruh it will be here in a couple months just chill we already won. We get to play it.
---
I feel this. WoW fucked over my college studies back in the day.
---
But I'm 32 here. Fixed hour job, plenty of vacation days accrued, no kids, my own house, ready to go. I just have a wife which eats up most of my free time.
---
Perplexity is a god tier rogue in pvp, you can look him up on YouTube. Although he doesn’t really do guides you can still watch his pvp clips to learn how to be better
---
What was blizzards 2018 revenue buddy
---
It took years for OSRS to get a separate category
---
Not everyone will log in at the same time, or play 24/7, and they'll level at different rates too. I would think that by the time they need to start looking at the layers, the population will be spread out enough that it won't be a huge issue
---
Its not hard and you gather the materials as you go. Would pair it with skinning.
---
I played a DPS warrior all the way to and through naxx with a minimum of tanking, only tanked when the fight required me to. Except for the odd onyx and rag tanking.
---
In dungeons I was always DPS, you just need to play with friends and it will be easier.
---
hunter really isn't that popular though
---
So... to clarify,  you think blizzard should allow a load of people who play PRIVATE servers that doesnt benefit blizzard in any way shape or form "deserve" to play the beta more than streamers? Who often, btw, play the retail version that DOES benefit blizzard?
---
That's like complaining that Rolex are allowing people who buy their watches to test a new watch rather than people who buy knock offs...
---
Q4 2018 a record $7.50 billion
---
&gt;But that's false.
---
No. No it's not. Don't try to tell me getting rank 14 requires the same skill as getting gladiator. At least half of the player base has the skill to get Rank 14 should they put in the hours. That is the only thing that matters. The hours.
---
sounds fun. Can you give me a quick run through about each spec tree? Your build seems great, but was wondering if destro or demonology are as fun/involved?
---
Wait, if that's the formula then I've got an amazing joke for you.
---
A building in Eridu, Mesopotamia collapses.
---
I know they're getting publicity for the game which is a great thing, I haven't gotten an invite, my nephew came over and he let me play the stress test, which was neat, and i submitted a few bugs for sure.  With that being said, of all the channels that you've watched, have you seen them submitting any bugs, or reporting any issues, or are they just playing like it's retail classic.?
---
Those where the best days of my life.. NA NA NAAA, NAA NA NA
---
your just going to be a healer unpess you want to pay fuckloads of g9od on respec's
---
im actually going paladin to heal and dislike the other builds
---
Bonsai kitten has to be one of the most successful trolls of all time and that's from that era. There were some real doozies back then.
---
Oh my God these are amazing! I like how your paint skills are getting better and better each time!
---
Hope she gets corpse camped. Absolutely ridiculous. Retail WoW is running point on the logistics/beta access, classic team putting in the work. Just have to hope that influence doesn't find its way into the game after launch.
---
Thanks! I rolled undead during retail because it looked cool. Now, I would like to be the green Drake Dog.
---
Imagine getting to 60 without having to kill a single mob /s
---
Holy crap, I completely forgot about ST.
---
I fondly remember deadmines, gnomer, SM, the BRD, LBRS and UBRS.  But Sunken Temple was fucking huge.
---
For real, I would solo some heroics on my pally later into the expansion, it was pretty stupid.
---
Actually new one is better imo
---
Shitty argument. If you want to use a retarded analogy so will I.  
---
That's like complaining that vaccinations cause autism. You don't know shit. "Let's not invite people that wanted classic, that actually know the game so they can find all of our bugs."
---
I am sorry everyone is white knighting the shit out of this and throwing around the word entitled like it makes them sound mature. Your frustration is valid. Try to think of it as advertising instead of an actual beta. Streamer preview or something. Half of the bug reports aren't even bugs and the other half are new features to provide the vanilla experience while also implementing stuff that has never been done in any iteration of wow. Currently on the beta most of the people I see are just leveling shit to practice or leveling things they have no intention of playing in the live version. Honestly I had more fun during the stress test with a blajillion people foolin around than i do in the beta with just a few hundred trying to make videos or streaming. You feel like you're missing out but beta is kinda pointless when most bug reports go to the trash can and most of the people suck.
---
I did. I fucking laughed my ass off because he shouldn't be in the beta.
---
So don't play, no one cares if you feel ripped off.
---
I’d be all for a BMAH for just TGC items as a big gold sink. IF it comes to needing one that is
---
Activision Blizzard currently includes five business units:[6] Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, King,[7] Major League Gaming,[8] and Activision Blizzard Studios.[9][10] Whats ur point?
---
Interesting. I always thought dm ruin was best for dps. I'll keep that in mind.
---
UD starting zone is the only one that gives them real competition. Actually I'd put it ahead of all the alliance ones too. Too bad I have to start in Durotar. :(
---
Yeah I will hopefully make it to all the classes at some point =D
---
I will probably just remote in from work if we’re being honest here.
---
:)
---
That's gonna be a no for me dawg
---
&gt;Why let other people dictate how you want to experience the world?
---
This is the same argument people use to support LFR. "Just don't use it!" doesn't work, because the world (of Warcraft) is all intertwined. If other people are flying, you can't just stick to ground mounts because you're giving yourself a massive disadvantage. Unless you want to pretend WoW works as a single player game (which, as we see in retail, it doesn't), this argument is nonsense.
---
Why does it start that late in your part of the world?
---
this is why i don't feel guilty about running a site that sells counterfeit pictures of her feet, all I did was shave mine and hold the camera far away so they look smaller and nerds lap that shit up
---
D:
---
This sub is really Risin up lately
---
I’m weary of how many other people will try this
---
So you saw a joke and just felt like being an asshole? Got it.
---
Streamer priority aside, since other people have already talked about that in detail:
---
Beta is not only for spotting differences between Classic and the Original Release, it's for finding flaws and bugs in general. Brand new players with no experience are incredibly valuable for this, because they behave in less predictable ways. They don't know what the game expects them to do, so they do weird stuff that's completely out of the ordinary, run into walls that an experienced player might never touch, interact with NPCs in strange orders and circumstances, etc.
---
Don't make the mistake of assuming that just because someone has never played Vanilla (or even WoW in general) that they have no valuable feedback to offer.
---
Well, if they know you play a PS, you can be banned, so I am sure that's why you didn't exactly get a ticket in. As irritating as it can be, more streamers playing means tons of free advertising, which means more players, which is more monetary support for classic, as well as helping extend the life of classic via having a decent playerbase size. We're all excited, and I understand being frustrated, but this isn't going to help you or anyone else.
---
There are other classes like hunter / shaman that also pose a large threat, its definitely true. Especially as gear progresses.
---
Oh gotcha, so no matter where I level I'll still have access to my races mount. But in order to get the other races mounts I'll have to get exalted first, thank you!
---
Streamers (I assume you mean professional streamers, as in that is their actual job) were like what? A single digit percentile of beta/stress invites?
---
Bruh, do you not know Esfand was a classic wow streamer? That's how he literally started his streaming career. Same with a bunch of other streamers, they streamed classic wow private servers. Guess what, they are in the beta.
---
No school has such brutal schedule, so that must mean you fucked up all previous semesters with gaming or whatever, and you had to work double time to make up for it. My compliments if you made it though.
---
Most people with a brain actually believe this is a casual an hardcore friendly game, i think you're getting triggered by a minority. Just breath man everything will be fine
---
If you can prove that, then I can believe your statement.
---
I smell a rat, last week he was level one this week he is killing Raggy, hax!!!! Reported!
---
Did you ever consider that BC had more players because it took time for players to get interested in WoW/become aware that WoW existed?  I know a lot of people that didn't get into WoW because they didn't know it was a good game back then.  
---
I would love to see them somehow make Classic+ with maybe some content from both TBC and WOTLK, but maintaining the community, the level 60 cap, and the integrity of vanilla.
---
Yeah probably, just the thought of someone actively telling others they aren’t welcome because they are new bothers me lol.
---
Like I’m an asshole, but it seems only self serving to want as many people to play as humanly possible AS LONG AS IT DOESNT COMPROMISE THE ACTUAL GAME
---
The only reasonable revenge is to be ahead of the curve on release. Then proceed to gank low level players systematically to the point they actually quit the game. 
---
Voila! You actually made a nano dent in Blizzard’s revenue!
---
[A centipede, in *MY* vagina?!](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/5553)
---
I feel dumber now
---
I think MC/ZG are pretty casual friendly. Maybe BWL depending on the group you hang out with. But once AQ comes out and places enormous mat, resistance, rep requirements just to learn fights? Gonna be rough to keep up.
---
It sure is among gold farmers -_-
---
Logged into retail made a human mage shot 2 fireballs, no mana was gone wolf was dead. Great rpg experience. /s
---
You’re just a nobody, there’s no reason to give you beta. Marketing is a thing. The harsh truth.
---
My mom loves to game and I am getting her a laptop to play classic, so there :) She's 57 and plays ES here and there I was like nope you're playing wow! I also got 4-5 new ppl on board that never played along with a ton of return players.
---
I don't get it. What's smooth about taking one step per 20 feet while sliding the rest of the way?
---
Undead/Undercity is amazing. In fact during original Vanilla release Undercity won best gaming town/city by what I believe was PC Mag!
---
What if i told you that you won't use it.... at all.
---
This actually made me laugh strictly because I pictured you ripping a game from your mothers hand like THIS IS A WOW HOUSE!
---
Also raids that use to last 6 hours will not even last half that nowadays with the simple mechanics and everyone’s knowledge of raiding now.
---
Poor Americans, work themselves to death so that billionaires like Trump get richer. And than half of them vote for that system.  I guess all that work makes them brain-dead too.....
---
Nah no ones saying its just for a specific group of people. The only reason we are here right now is cause of Nos and the community. Obviously people are mad that streamers (not naming anyone), that have never played the game or have no clue are getting in over the people that can actually give input and find bugs because they have played for years.
---
Yeah, I feel that. I want to play classic with my friends, but I don't want to be that guy... Don't want to rope people into my addiction hahaha
---
Looks like SOME one didn't get what they wanted. Isnt that right booboo ahh hudubudududu
---
A well played resto druid is hard as hell to kill.  I had a few nearly run me out of mana on  my lock, and thats saying something.
---
Who's healing?
---
Oh, it's the fucking tree.  Target him.  
---
Every bloody time.
---
flying on my .... ?
---
10/10
---
Then why are you even here? Seem very upset on something that hasn't been apart of your life in a long long while.
---
Both can be quite fun classes in their own right.  
---
In order to help you I would need to know what your goals for Classic will be focused on at 60.
---
World PvP? Organized PvP? Raiding? Dungeons? Solo play?  
---
In general I would say that both classes are best played with a partner to heal or damage, but Priests are a bit more capable for solo play as Shadow, however. You won't have an easy time finding a raid spot as Shadow as guilds will only bring 1 per raid max.  
---
Warrior's are taken everywhere for both tanking and damage but they are the most played class by far so you will need to go above and beyond to secure a raiding spot if thats your intrest.  
---
Really it depends on what your end game goals are.
---
True, well when there are bugs on launch they will know why.
---
Based on what facts?
---
Haha, I didn't even question it at first because they feel like similar zones actually
---
If you don't like streamers then don't watch them
---
I look at it like this. Do you really think that YOU (not actually you just a general you) are the missing link that would improve this game so much to the point it’s not worth a TON of free advertising by giving it to literally any successful streamer? 
---
How can someone be so arrogant lol.
---
Also never stated this but I don’t much care for twitch I have no horse in this race. But logically it’s far better to give it to the streamer
---
In general what is the stray for 1-5 on a launch? Questing, grinding mobs, or exploration?
---
Because Vanilla WoW was the shit, and I'm stoked.
---
Why else?
---
pretty much. my old one was a shitty, HQ Compaq from Wal-Mart like a lot of people, so, i was raiding at a rock-solid 10-15 FPS. it died when i moved and i just never bothered to recover the screenshots.
---
get fucked Robert
---
K
---
Aww, I like BE starting. Especially ghostlands. Tirisfal is better for level 1-10, though.
---
The priority in Stress Test were for Beta Accounts, but whatever makes you happy.
---
Woooooaaahhh Braaaah Shroooms, Dude Weed L M A O.
---
hybrid classes have never been considered bad, they're all fantastic healers
---
Warrior is abysmal to level with but pays off by being the only real raid tank, likely best raid DPS, and a complete monster at pvp with high gear.
---
 Priest isnt great for leveling, but it's better than warrior  they're the defacto healer for vanilla (holy) in terms of raw numbers, shadow is only going to be in raids as a max one of for mana, but shadow is pretty good in pvp. 
---
End of day I can't tell you what's fun for you or has better flavor, I can just tell you their perceived viability- which is strong for both classes
---
Slitherin professors?
---
I understand the game has been around for several years, and I know beta is to fix things, but how many "bugs" or "issues" are being reported,  i'm glad the game is getting recognition, but i'd like a fun experience when it hits retail.
---
Slithessors.

Honestly the fact that the majority that have beta access are content creators or friends and family of Blizzard employees. Is flooding media channels in hopes that it will build hype. To a point it will, but when does it generate audience burn out and implode on its own hype. 
---
Once you have watched your favorite content creator do all the content. What’s the incentive to do it yourself.
---
Another thing the audience isn’t realizing is that the current beta is in and of itself a very close knit community. Classic was one of the few times where the game experience relied heavily on social interaction, player reputation. 
---
If you’re a toxic asshat you will not have as great an experience as someone who is respectful and knowledgeable about their class. 
---
A lot of “New” players will come in with the idea of instant gratification from “welfare epics” and quickly learn there is none. You work for that set you want. 
---
That set is what sets you apart from the plebs that don’t raid/pvp at a end game level. 
---
Essentially the hype will build and the game will be packed for the first month or 2, but then the hype will die off and players will go back to the current content due to it being cruise control with training wheels.
---
Lists of basically every single piece of loot in the game, where to get them, and their costs. Lists of every monster in the game, their abilities and hit points. Lists of drop rates. Just tons of good stuff.
---
What I want is less streamers that have no knowledge of classic or the game getting in, and more people that actually have experience to get in.
---
Even though I don't live there, I have proclaimed it a wow house now lol  She wanted to play back in the day when I was 25 but I was like naw mom lol  Now it's reversed I'm 38  and want her to jam.
---
I said you can get banned. Not will.
---
I mean, its basic mathematics. How many beta/stress test invites were put out? How many streamers were streaming the beta/stress test? Look at any stream when the who list gets pulled and the amount of randoms on the list. You are on the Alex Jones shit right now.
---
well there are like 2k people on the beta, 1% of that is 20 people, so if you extrapolate that to the highest single-digit percentile you'd get 180 to 199 (9% - 9.9%) streamers.  Do you think there are more than 180 streamers in the beta?  Because I don't...
---
I would say that my goals for classic WoW between these two classes would be PvP and raiding. Thanks for your informative reply.
---
Yeah obviously , but if even 2 percent of the people that played because of a streamer stay that’s a huge positive to the game.
---
Most have IT systems blocking all things like Battlenet these days.
---
bg map
---
Why does it matter?  It's a closed beta, and by the nature of that streamers and media types are expected to be included.
---
This sort of rage is a huge problem in the community now.  Closed beta means blizz gets to decide who gets in, and everyone whining about it isn't going to change that nor should it.
---
If anything is getting in the way of "crafting a great game" it's people bitching about this sort of stuff when the game is releasing in just a few months anyway.
---
Many complaining about this crap are trolls.  None of this matters.
---
i doubt player skill is any higher
---
if we are lucky there will be less keyboard turners
---
That doesn't change the fact that Streamers that streamed classic wow got in. I don't get your first point, literally makes no sense.
---
Casual = bad?? I always thought it had to do with time
---
I swear to god if I come down these stairs ONE MORE TIME AND SEE YOU PLAYING ESO there is gonna be hell to pay
---
I'm glad you don't decide that then.
---
he also made a ton of youtube videos and other content for the game, how the fuck would blizz even know your ass played private servers?  Answer: they wouldn't, because you are not as special as you think you are.
---
One of the biggest things we have learned from this beta is that private servers had a ton of shit wrong. People who played LH and Nost will not know any better than a rando. They may actually be worse as they may report things as bugs that are working as intended. As for the streamers you are an idiot if you don't think every other game does this as well. They are building hype whether you like it or not. Marketing and the almighty dollar will always reign supreme
---
will blizzard remove the silver from pick pocketing like some of these pserver?
---
I'm not interested in boosting but I am considering it just because I've been obsessed with the defias leather set since I started playing and the chest has a notoriously low drop rate. I wouldn't have to pay for two subs for long.
---
Hallucinogens and reddit can be an odd combination
---
Correct, however having built rep with your races faction will grant a discount to your mounts cost, which is beneficial since gold is not as easily obtained.
---
We can only hope
---
&gt;..only a fool would decline
---
 A lot of people raid for the mix of killing internet dragons + comradery. Not everybody going to be that disloyal, I've actively poached it's so easy.
---
15 years, plus wikis, plus private servers, plus streamers. I don't think you are considering all the different factors.
---
Never said they made up the majority lol.
---
If only that didn’t apply to the meta classes as well! Then we’d be getting somewhere 😂
---
gear aint really a matter since at the end of the day, ill be no lifing lol
---
There are rumors of them continuing to create content for classic WoW beyond even Naxx. My belief is they will do horizontal content release for classic, while keeping the levels at 60.
---
You will see a lot more druids because of PvP than you did vanilla, specially cause of sodapoppin
---
The main difference between then and now is; 
---
WOW Vanilla was introduced as a better, more casual Everquest. So the players attracted to and coming to play the game were in part, already playing a far more non-noob friendly game.
---
WoW Classic is being introduced where there is very little in the way of good, solid, gridy MMO's and the biggest rival other than FFO is BFA, which is so casual friendly that it's funny. 
---
I think what people fail to voice is that people who start playing games now, often do so with the mind set that a game will be easy and that the things they want to do they will do. This isn't the case at all!
---
this is just wrong gamers are much better than they  were in 2005
---
She is far from the only streamer who has not played vanilla that has gained access to the beta. Destiny has never played WoW period and he has access, and there are plenty of others.
---
Yeah I guess orc 25% stun resist is meh...
---
Just in Asmon and old Soda guild there were like almost 2000 people combined, now count evey streamer that you can think of: Soda, Asmon, Esfand, Soni D, Quin69, Mizkif, Mitch Jones, Payo, Shroud, Staysafe, Joana, Pokimane, Trainwreck, Pokelawls, Swifty, Monkeynews, Venruki, C9 Kala, xQc, Nick, etc  
---
I can't even think of anyone anymore, now combine EVERY STREAMER and compare just with their Guild members, now imagine comparing with the WHOLE SERVER.
---
Your argument is invalid no matter what, dellusional.
---
Yeah, but it’s not like they have many options today right? Like if they playing an older styled game and see what it’s like, why these things were popular in the first place. It may sway some opinions
---
Is it trackable by DBM?
---
Just play TBC dude ;)
---
And there are going to be plenty of people experiencing it for the first time. I still remember flying over searing gorge as a low level on the flight from SW to IF and how epic it was seeing the lava spiders. I was scared to death of that place before ever setting foot in there
---
Depends on how many viewers a streamer needs to be considered a 'streamer'. If the cut off is like +10 viewers, ya I can see that. But you probably right.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKutw1zDgms
---
" People who played LH and Nost will not know any better than a rando." That's the dumbest shit I read all day, you should delete your reddit account.
---
Wait is that world first?
---
I never said I was special.
---
Moron
---
Dont go it then... your posts sound like you have a high opinion of yourself and and should be able to play one of the highest skill ceiling classes in PvP at the top of its level within what a couple of months on an arena/dueling pserver?
---
Go play a ret pally or something.
---
The problem is people thinking beta = early access
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Sure it's not like people's opinion that new players shouldn't play the game actually stops them from playing the game. 
---
But they will no doubt struggle and where you have a huge majority of players learning the game, that will then increase the amount of disparity between veteran players and new players.
---
I'M gonna be tilted if Blizzard doesn't fix this for Classic!
---
&lt;STAMPERS&gt; reporting in
---
You're the kind of guy who thinks you do, but you dont. You'll quit within a week and go back to fortnite, kid!
---
I never said streamers out number the players, what kind of crack are you smoking? That being said, you can do better at listing more streamers lmao. Also bunch of those streamers don't know shit about classic or WoW.
---
Raids in Vanilla were always pretty easy, it was getting 40 people to coordinate and communicate effectively that was difficult.
---
That said, I still won’t consider “being carried” as an offspec to be “viable”. They’ll be about as good as a player afk’ing at the raid entrance.
---
Vael will still be a gear-checking, skill-checking, spec-checking guild killer.
---
Why would a BG added in cataclysm be coming to classic
---
I couldn't decide between Warr, Rogue and Mage for a while but decided on Warrior when I learned I didn't have to solo/open world farm to get the gold for my mount and consumables - just do some dungeons and reserve the reagent drops
---
I wish I could get a taste for how tanking at 60 was on Warr though, I plan to tank dungeons and mainly DPS but offtank as-needed raids but I have no idea if it will actually be fun. I tanked some of Cata as a blood DK, took a break and healed as a paladin in Mists, then played a lot of prot pally in mists and guardian druid in Legion (plus Warr tanking in FFXIV's Heavensward.) 
---
Losing access to good AoE tools and having to yell at my party members to let me build threat first sounds like it will be quite trying on my patience, and I feel like everything will be so foreign that it might not even be enjoyable. Warr DPSing looks really nice though
---
so, not even level 60 for most people?
---
Classic is about whatever you want it to be. Some people enjoy min maxing and rushing content.
---
I mean no at a glance it wouldn’t. But if that kind of attitude catches on and spreads. That’s where I take issue. 
---
Should strive to share and spread knowledge and welcome others to enjoy what we enjoy. Instead of trying to hoard it like some old miser. 
---
AGAIN I am in general not a nice person. But even I recognize the absolute benefit to try and help and bring in new players
---
Of course. But the norm isn't to spend 12 hours a day doing that shit.
---
Most gamers play games at least 8 hours a day. It's a joke. Especially MMO gamers.
---
Ah the moron bandwagoner speaks again.
---
Hunter is still ok for raiding tier 1 anyway, which is the furthest 90% of people are going to get. Same goes for most classes actually.
---
When you test software for bugs you always need also people who aren't familiar with the product. People who have been using the product for 10 years know what they are doing and don't play the game "wrong" so easily and many bugs don't occur to them.
---
At least you admit you are only a novice. Once again, this Beta has proved that Private Servers had a ton of shit wrong. Someone who has only played LH and Nost will be just as good as person has hasn't played at all. If you are just going to be an asshole and not bring anything to the discussion, then just fuck off.
---
It's all just a part of the plan to prevent server crash on launch day. It's gonna go down anyway.
---
Depends on what u wanna do at endgame. 
---
If you’re planning on tanking raids, you’ll always get an invite and loot priority. Shadow priest usually get a spot in raids as well. I’ve played as both and had no issues with finding groups. Both classes have their pros and cons. Whatever u choose tho will be fine.
---
Except sw is closer to yojamba isle for zg buff
---
Or they are so arrogant to believe THEY are the savior THEY would be the difference that makes this game a huge success.......
---
The biggest thing you will need to realize about Classic vs. Retail is that you aren't really supposed to be competing with your entire raid for who does the best damage but rather, you compete with other guild members of the same class.  
---
This was a big part of why there were class leaders for each class in Vanilla, so that the top player for each class who undertsood the game the best could help manage other people of the same class on what they need to do per fight, and who who loot would be most beneficial based on preformance and attendance.   
---
Play what you think you will enjoy, If you like competition that's fine, just compete with people of the same class because realistically you aren't going to beat warrior's rogues and mages.
---
Hey just want to provide you with the interview so you are not so scared anymore https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8. Watch from about 5:30, he says they will be gone as soon as possible expecting to be gone by a few weeks. And 100% will be gone before they introduce world bosses, since they dont want people to have the opportunity to just jump later in order to kill the bosses
---
My asshole is red,
---
and my balls are blue,
---
got trounced by Blizzard,
---
and so will you
---
Man what a fucking journey it's been. Gratz on kill
---
Pokimane brought all the salty nerds out to complain. That's the saddest part. If they're to be believed, and they really played back in 2004, then it means they're grownass men now. At least 30+.
---
Can you imagine being over 30 and crying because *Pokimane* got F&amp;F Beta access over you?
---
Sheesh. Stay classy, r/classicwow.
---
Lucky. I start september first which means I will be in the process of moving for the forst few days of Classic. I will completely miss launch.
---
The increase will be negligible at higher ranks.  By that time you have spell power which is going to be a bigger factor.
---
The time has come atlas
---
It has to be on curse then right?  
---
Ill try to get it up there \^\^
---
play the game when it comes out
---
Tbf you couldve been super young when playing vanilla. But yeah it's sad, imagine being an adult that complains a streamer got invited to a beta because of them being used as advertising
---
Haha true boys
---
It apparently tilts grown men and women as well.
---
you wont miss those things if you haven't played mmo's before.
---
&gt;. I predict the meta of this sub to drastically change in content once classic launches 
---
Seems like a an outrageously safe bet
---
Honestly it’s not wholly on skill. A lot of it is itemization that wasn’t there to support some specs being viable along with bad or broken mechanics.
---
It destroyed our community in the server, I guess you had to be there.
---
Except you have to make an account and sign up for a free trial which probably means credit cards.
---
It is working! ;)
---
I remeber it too
---
Sure, but how young? I mean, even if you were 12 in 2004, that makes you 27 right now. 
---
27 is old enough to not be crying about Pokimane getting into the Beta over you. 27 is working a 9-5 job just to make rent (assuming they don't still live in their mom's... lol, okay I won't make that joke anymore.)
---
I can't imagine the toxicity that's going to come from bosses like vael. It's going to be retail players screeching vanilla is easy why haven't we killed this leading into more and more toxicity until guilds implode
---
Retail still has 4:3 loading screens, so not sure why it's bothering you so much.
---
Something intrensting to note... if it is possible to do the quest for the level 10 quest for wailing caverns, the "Cresent Staff reward" is just absolutetly amazing for anyone that can weild it. Espieally Warriors. The damage on that staff far exceeds anything u can get at that level.

As a management consultant I will probably play my journey of 1-60 from airports and hotel rooms. Because of that, leveling is of highest priority when I choose class. I’ll probably go Hunter or Priest.
---
Correct. Hitting 60 on your warrior doesn’t make you strong. 
---
Gearing the fuck out of that Warrior makes you strong.
---
That takes an absurd amount of hours
---
I'm sorry I can't talk to you, you are actually the biggest moron I have encountered on this thread so far. 
---
&gt;  Someone who has only played LH and Nost will be just as good as person has hasn't played at all  
---
&gt; not bring anything to the discussion
---
Warrior levelling isnt abysmal on the beta. Their HP regen is high, and it isnt hard to play it safe as to not die even when pulling multiple mobs. The difficulty is overexaggerated which might stem from it being harder on private servers.
---
Old school mmo is harder. Its gobna turn him away from it if you lie.
---
It’s inevitable that when a group of people interact with each other there can be drama.. my guild broke up in three parts through the duration of mine being in it but I still loved some of the people there and kept in contact with them. Where there’s real people there can always be drama in my experiences
---
he's talking about a pve environment. ofc orc racial is great for pvp.
---
Right. Far more than 280.
---
Since Classic requires significantly more social interaction than the Retail Game, I would expect the negative side to social interaction to return as well as the positive.
---
What *should* be the most common class?
---
Yeah, it's kind of sad. Like I don't think there's any justifiable reason to it
---
Ret is viable, Feral is Viable, Shadow is Viable. 
---
They all just require guild cooperation, gear and LOT's of farming consumes.   
---
Feral can beat rogues in BWL/MC  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O\_idQn9Vb1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_idQn9Vb1U)

Shadow is always needed to boost warlock damage but can be quite high on the charts with some gear and class knowlege.

Ret can also be quite competative if you know what you are doing.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy\_bEEUZ4bc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy_bEEUZ4bc)   
---
So yes you are right, with the quality of knowledge and skill among players today, these specs can be viable and work well for PvE, but you have to sink a lot of time into gearing them and farming every consumable you can.  
---
Play what you want to play but don't be suprised if you are still asked to heal dungeons and raids from time to time. I would say pick what you want. It may take a little searching but you will find a guild that is willing to take you if you put some time in and show they you are dedicated. That will always be more important to raid leaders than having the most optimal raid comp.
---
so the issue with getting more than one for your guild is that the boss you have to kill in under five hours has a weekly reset?
---
Yes he knows that. He saying the reason people hung out in IF was that’s where the first AH was in vanilla so people got in the habit of it. He’s not saying the SW auction house should be removed.
---
downvoted by white knight virgins.
---
It's kind of fascinating to see how out of touch they are.
---
Twitch bought out the old curse client but it works practically the same. I am hoping most of the classic addons end up there

It won’t be as bad as before. Having a fury warrior tank him is a relatively “new” strategy. Some private server guilds have killed him in under 16 seconds with only gear that drops before him.
---
Was looking for this comment haha.
---
Teldrasill and Dun Morogh might just be the 2 most immersive zones ever created in WoW.
---
As a former newbie this emis exactly correct.
---
Dude same, even though it was over a decade ago
---
Literally my first dungeon run on my first toon (druid) 
---
Shit was so hype
---
Guild drama never ceased to exist. However, I'm very much looking forward to that delicious server drama again. That was always fun to watch from afar.
---
I'm 33. I'm not watching streamers, I'm waiting patiently for release. As are all my old guildies and friends who played. I think your perspective might be being jaded by the vocal minority, ain't nobody else got time for that.
---
I aim to please
---
Lol looks like that dude was the salty/toxic one.
---
Esfand is a legit paladin and legit vanilla player
---
Truth: blizzard won't allow it until some time after launch. When they have half a million viewers on twitch, it makes the whole franchise look good. Which they really need right now, because wow along with all their other franchises are tanking.
---
I know hating on streamers is all the rage on this subreddit, but I feel like Esfand did a good job in this encounter. Faking with Furbolg Form was good, for example.
---
&gt; I think your perspective might be being jaded by the vocal minority, ain't nobody else got time for that.
---
I agree, but this thread was made by OP because they're clearly blown away at the endless threads being made today on this sub complaining and crying over certain streamers “who didn't even play back then” getting into Beta over them.
---
It's really sad.
---
The ground moves faster obviously, while your body stays the same.
---
Ret will always be much much worse than bringing anything else. The "you have to put in more effort" argument is invalid because if you have to compare classes and specs under equal conditions.
---
Paladins are healers.
---
&gt;tons of bad players that run min/max builds but do not have the mechanical skill to execute their build.
---
Not sure there are a lot of hard mechanics of most classes
---
"Phone rings, I answer"... Man, this game is so freaking old.
---
Yup. Plus EPL/WPL (scholo/strat and argent dawn grinding), and IIRC menethil harbour is closer to IF than Booty Bay is to SW (for getting to Kalimdor).
---
Pretending they arent valid doesnt invalidate them either. Cool that it works that way.
---
That's fair, I guess. Still not worth wasting energy caring over imo. If op has that sort of free time and stress quota to meet then I guess let him bitch. Not like reason works on people these days.
---
Remindme! 95 days „imp“
---
Wait so is it only skill if it comes naturally to you the first time you play?
---
I can guarantee you a streamer getting beta access didn't take the spot from anyone else.
---
Why did I learn to read English. Just damm
---
Oddly enough we are all thinking the same about you. You come across as a whiny bitch and an asshole. Stick to private servers you fit there, you are toxic as fuck.
---
Yeah, I checked, they want a cc number...
---
Why would Night elves want a horse instead of their uber cool cats? Or undeads riding wolves instead of neon skeleton horses?
---
Even in pve, I'm not sure how forsaken would be better than orc.
---
Post history, and being an idiot.
---
Is this the new AdventureQuest game?
---
I don’t think it’s there in 1.12 unfortunately. Kind of immersion breaking because quest text and lore books in the world reference the “two moons” all the time
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Well yeah not everyone but it's a really good offer so a lot of people are going to take it.
---
There is also a misconception on what the term hard actually means. Many people seems to think that only raid boss mechanics makes the game "hard".  Sometimes slower actually means harder in the sense that it means more effort.
---
100% agree with the others. SW is better for 30, in general I feel it’s the “levelling” city and has so many quests and important levelling zones nearby. 
---
IF will be the place to be at 60 no doubt.
---
Yes, there will always be guild drama. Will prob be worst in classic tbh.
---
A Warrior with literally anybody to back them up becomes God Tier. Warriors lack hard CC, if a Warrior can attack you, you're going to die, so you don't need a Priest, just any class that can slow/root people.
---
Yeah, I mean, I have been playing nonstop every day. I guess its easy to say "no big deal" when you have access.
---
I think Wowhead is way off on that stuff. Classicdb lists a required level of 17 for Isha Awak for example, which makes a lot more sense.
---
The huge portion of people who wanted this game will defend it against those who are just jumping on a hype train throwing ideas out because now they are interested. 
---
You can teach people sure, but you can't remove habits and you certainly have to smash the thoughts about LFR etc
---
guild drama always happens. Doesn't matter what expansions. 
---
Whats funny to me is that my personal experience with wow guild drama is that it happens way more often in your typical family and friend or semi hardcore raid guilds than in hardcore raid guilds. 
---
I used to raid hardcore for years (world top 30) in 3 different guilds and the only drama in those guilds that i experienced was people that stopped playing mid progress or a few small heated discussions during progress but nothing really guild breaking. 
---
Before that though i was in 2 guilds that would be considered a "family and friend" guild and a semi hardcore guild. The drama in those guilds is awful lol. Like petty he said/she said stuff. 
---
One guild broke because one dude had something going on with a girl from the guild but they had a fight and said girl started chilling with another dude from the guild in teamspeak like every night. 
---
First dude was jealous as fuck and the drama started which eventually led to a group of people leaving and starting their own guild.
---
Being willing to learn and improve. Some people absolutely refuse to do any self reflection or accept criticism, even constructive. It doesn't matter your skill level, as long as you don't have a shit attitude you can become a great player in time.
---
Streamers got in because:
---
1. There can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of eyes on the beta and those people can all bring bugs to Blizzard's attention.
---
2. Guaranteed video evidence of bugs.
---
3. They can play 18 hours a day therefore more hours of data for Blizzard.
---
4. Of course hype.
---
Can't you just make a long swim, die in a certian place, and rez in the zone you wanted to be in? Not that it's general knowledge, so I guess it doesn't matter much.
---
What really bums me out is the modern party frames ..
---
10 avg for the "hardcore" crowd
---
Imagine being around 30 years old and complaining that a random streamer got a beta invite to a video game.
---
What race should i be flow chart for classic.
---
Are you pvping? Yes
---
Is the class you want to play avaiable as Orc? Yes
---
Play orc.
---
It would be cool if they made it right. It's such a small detail but as important as the rest. It wasn't in the original by accident, remember that.
---
They didn’t add it until Naxx iirc.
---
One thing I’d like them to avoid is letting people transfer to low pop realms to get Scarab Lord
---
It’s one of the issues, yes, and certainly the first major one. There are other steps to the quest chain that require a raid team that only drop one quest item per raid.
---
And it’s not just “kill this boss in under 5 hours”, it’s kill 7 bosses in under 5 hours, including all the trash, without wiping.
---
Completing the scepter is easily the most difficult task for a guild in Vanilla WoW. At least until the gates are open and then again later when Naxx drops.
---
Very few guilds will accomplish it. If you don’t have BWL on farm and experience dealing with World Bosses (especially on a PVP server), then it’s just not going to happen. 
---
In my digging, I haven’t found a single guild that completed two scepters in time for the mount. Not even sure it’s possible without the entire realm colluding to put off ringing the gong. And why would they? The rarer the mount, the greater the prestige.
---
I will have a "playing with wife" character I'm starting with her, on a PVE server so she doesn't get frustrating by endless ganking and quit early when I want to keep playing.
---
Ignore the people saying Warrior sucks to level with, that stigma is from the original launch of WoW, not 1.12. Once you get to 20, and especially 30, things are to speed up dramatically. Hamstring kiting, while not super fun, is VERY efficient and lets you chainpull mobs all the way to 60 without much downtime.
---
Also contrary to popular belief, stacking Spirit while leveling is incredible. The problem with Warriors isn't their kill speed, it's their downtime. Get enough spirit to regen you out of combat fairly quickly and you'll be lvl 60 a lot faster than the guy stacking nothing but STR, and wasting tons of gold on food.
---
This is perfect
---
I can see a lot making it to 19/20 and then switching .
---
I'm talking about the real beta server, not stress test. More like 100 out of 2k = 5%.  I shouldn't even be correcting you because I already addressed the point that even if it is 1 person, it not going to change much. I recognize that.  Hurting productivity wasn't my point.
---
Can’t be. There were definitely blood elf paladins in vanilla. 100% real
---
BRD perhaps faster
---
Strat can already be fast though, I would guess it doesn’t help
---
Why would you do that?????? You can just take the two boats through wetlands. Granted it won’t be that much faster if they don’t line up but still should be faster....
---

Envious much? He asked the question before the in-game moon(s) were visible. I was just letting him know that I’d be answering his question as soon as it was actually possible.

You are mindless sheep that gets butthurt when someone makes fun of your intellectual level. Lay off the internet if a non toxic comment makes you upset. That being said I made valid points and all you did was spew your bullshit that literally made 0 sense. Only reason we are here to this day is because of Nos and the community. You are a moron, but you prob already know that irl.
---
No. Ion said not only as long as needed but also 100% not longer than phase 1 because phase 2 introduces world bosses and they definitely should not be duplicated.
---
didnt know it was cata bg map, thats why i asked the question0

Looking back it seems like Lvl 20/30/40/50 twins BGs would have been better than 19/29/39/49.

I mean I am glad that they invited so many streamers. I get to see the game, from many different views. And I get to see how other people react to the game. I knew i would never get the beta invite my self since I havnt been subscribed since cataclysm. And even tho I was playing from vanilla till cata, and had beta access in both wotlk and cata, I havnt seen a beta invite since I stopped my subscription. So ye I like that they invited alot of streamers and I kinda love seeing how people that have never played it before go from being this is so stupid to holy shit I played 10 hours to day, it was only supposed to be a short stream
---
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Too soon...
---
Actually locks and shadow priests benefit each other. They are almost symbiotic. I played a SP in vanilla both over and pvp and ran with 2 different locks depending. 
---
The hardest part was getting over the “But you’re a priest you heal, you don’t DPS” bullshit that everyone had stuck in their minds. When in reality if paired with a skilled lock with both equally geared they can really help one another shine.
---
youre too good at this
---
Found the pleb who doesnt realize wand is an exception and cant spam it XD
---
Please tell me that is thornmail
---
They're ugly, but oh so iconic.
---
Every face option is unique, every casting and running animation distinct and charmingly "stiff"- none of that samey rubber bounce that every race has in the modern game.
---
Just compare Night Elf male running animation, they completely butchered it in retail.
---
He went from Chad to Dora the Explorer.
---
Yeah this is true, warlocks tend to benefit every class while shadow mostly just helped the two. But yeah I think based on all the information out there people will be more inclined to try out unconventional specs come Classic.
---
bruh...
---
This is a question that worries me about classic+
---
Are blizzard really prepared to undercut and retcon their WoW lore from the last 10 years? I wish they were, but it seems wasteful from their perspective

No, you don't know how to have a discussion. If someone disagrees with you, you get offended and call them a "moron" or an "idiot." No shit we are here because of nost you dense fuck. I never denied that. What I said is private servers had a ton of shit flat out wrong. Which means the private server community is just as fresh to Classic as someone who hasn't played any version. If I make 0 sense to you, then I am sorry but you are actually the moron. Now learn to actually facilitate a discussion instead of being a fucking keyboard warrior.

Buck Flizzard as guild name
---
I’m less upset about streamers getting invites over old-school players than I am about streamers getting invites over addon developers.
---
Blizzard is doing weird things to the API and it NEEDS testing by developers. It’s not quite Retail and not quite Vanilla, so pretty much every addon will need to be reworked for Classic.
---
There are a bunch of us working on a LFG addon and I’m the only one that got a beta invite. It makes testing very difficult.
---
A bunch of much more dedicated and experienced addon developers don’t have invites either.
---
Do you?
---
I did that once to level my undead with a friend's blood elf.
---
I refused to go there for about two weeks after just on principle once I learned about the orb.
---
Now that you say it, you may be correct. I honestly dont remember. Havnt played in 7 months or so.
---
The rest of what i said still stands tho :P
---
I agree it would be great to have it fixed. But to expect a fully 1 to 1 carbon copy of vanilla is a little crazy. 
---
There's no problem with this post pointing out the difference, and there's absolutely no problem with people wanting it fixed. But there's drastically more important things for them to work on I'm sure. 
---
They've already stated they're doing the best they can but won't be able to make everything 100% perfect. 
---
Flight path animations might not be something they feel is important enough to be messed with before launch or even after. It may even be tied in the ability to request a stop at the next FP. Which they've said they're keeping. 
---
So I would say it's pretty unrealistic to *expect* this or any other legitimately non game breaking issue to be changed. And it wouldn't be *disgraceful* if it didn't make it in..
---
Would it be a bummer? Sure. Would it be the same as vanilla ? No obviously not. Would it effect the experience as a whole so much that it would break the illusion of being in the early 2000's playing vanilla for real? Maybe for some people I suppose. 
---
In the end they're going to deliver as close to a vanilla experience as they can. But certainly won't be able to adjust every single thing like this, and it's pretty entitled to expect they will.
---
why wouldn't people have access to the flasks, or do you be alchemists?
---
Man how will they even replace a Paladin.
---
There was 12k people online today. It seems more and more people are coming back to practice leveling routes, test things, or just to dick around until August 27th. The hype is real.
---
God damn I hope there will be some restricions to the addons. The gameplay will not be the same if you have som AI type shit addon playing the game for you.
---
Dude I laughed so hard at the orc being feared he just looks so hilarious
---
WRONG druids will make better tanks on average than warriors in 60 dungeon level content
---
It is a dangerous question to ask. I debate with myself about the issue when I wake up every morning till I go to sleep at night.
---

There is about what, maximum 4k-5k players on the beta and I read an article about how many played on private servers were up to 1.3mill in 2016. + then we have a few mill playing the retail. And what like 10-15mill in all that have at some point played wow. I mean they have invited  what like 300 streamers? Still invited the majority of it as non streamers and with as many players to choose from as pointed out earlier. The chance of getting a beta invite without a subscription or anything that shows you will before alot more knowledgeable then the majority(like how alot of youtubers have been devoted to point out the details of classic prio to the release of the beta). I just dont see the reason to be asking for a beta invite, the chances are just not in anyone's favour
---
Nice try Blizzard.
---
Don't play retail.
---
hunter?
---
If you plan on end game raiding human is the only option IMO.
---
I started playing in December 04, and I have an active sub now, I'm not in the beta, which sucks, but I am thankful that Classic is coming out, and it's getting recognition for sure, and hoping that all the issues are being sorted out somehow.  I know it wont be like it will in 2004 ish, but just want to have a fun time with it, without a lot of bugs, and issues.
---
In patch 1.12 that is not really true. Druids are as good as or even better than warriors in 5 man dungeons.
---
lol
---
Hey man!
---
I've seen those films before and at the first glance, it looks very impressive. But with a little critical thinking it's one person and it's one guild. I don't know anything about this guild. For all I know the guild could keep very low standards. 
---
I'm not saying it does, I mean I just don't know. 
---
My point is that one person being able to play doesn't justify the specc itself.
---
About the consumables, the same thing can be said about enhancements. They can use almost every DPS increasing pot in-game, still they get nowhere close to e.g. a mage.
---
I don't mean to be rude, but if you want to impress me you need to present facts. Logs, theory crafting etc.
---
And scholomance was a level 60 dungeon? How did they do the bosses?
---
If you don’t have a level 110-120 yet, it will be hard but still doable if you want to endure bfa, you can make a lot of gold until september, I would say 2-3M is doable
---
&gt; all people want is an accurate and fast database site with a shared comment section from the various private server databases for further insight.
---
These private server databases contain a lot of false information, which is why it would be better to have a database that's directly from the official classic servers. Just wait until the game actually comes out and it will most likely be up to date thanks to the beta.
---
Flask recipes*
---
They are rare drops and very highly priced.
---
not bad not bad
---
So this was a clear example of people calling a bug based purely on an incorrect pserver value
---
Glad to hear. That's for sure a very iconic set and one of the reasons I started playing private servers a couple of years back. Benediction is lit!
---
Holly crap this is perfect
---
goblin = bombs where's the debate xD
---
if you know what you’re doing good making is a joke, you can easily make your sub with an hour on the AH
---
Addons will be more restrictive in Classic than they were in Vanilla, simply by the fact that we’re developing on a version of the Retail API.
---
If you’re looking for an authentic, #nochanges experience, then it’s a less restrictive API you’re looking for, not more.
---
In Vanilla, addons could cast spells, determine priority targets, and change key bindings in combat. You had addons that could intelligently remove debuffs from everyone in the raid just by spamming a button. Other addons would down rank your heals based on missing target health.
---
Something like an enemy cast bar *IS* the Vanilla experience. Addons are and were a huge part of the game and they will be again.
---
You could ask me if you really want to know.
---
I consider Alch good because you still use consumables in BfA.
---
I consider Ench good because you still use enchants in BfA.
---
I consider Engi good because you can still make cool gadgets that are beneficial for engineers in BfA.
---
I consider mining and skinning good because you can still make gold from it in BfA.
---
I consider cooking and fishing good because you still make buff food and need fish for said food.
---
Its true that First Aid was removed, i had forgotten about that.
---
And the reason i consider BS useless in Vanilla is that there are no best in slot items made from BS. The closest you get is Titanic Leggings and Lionheart helm. But they are not bis in naxx tier content. And there are items you can make with BS in BfA (or at least could make while i still played) which are good but not bis. They are basically mythic level gear without the possibility for titanforge procs. In other words they are great for gearing up for mythic raiding but not the best - the same as titanic leggings and lionheart helm.
---
Tailoring in vanilla can make bags, including the Bottomless Bag 18 slot bag which is the only way to get fully equipped with 18 slot bags. It is also the only way to get the 24 slot (i think it was 24) soul shard bag for warlocks. If it were not for bags i would say that  tailoring is as useless as BS/LW.
---
And the whole reason i made the comment was to point out that crafting in vanilla was by no means amazing. It was actually kinda terrible overall.
---
In TBC on the other hand...
---
Uh yeah it's obviously possible. How much is your time worth and is it worth it playing retail (lol) for that amount of time to make happen
---
A subscription is on average 50 cents per day to pay for. I can tell you without even knowing how much gold a retail token costs vs how long it takes to farm that gold that fucking around in retail to pay my sub is not worth my time.
---
Trading classic gold for retail gold/tokens could be a different story
---
There was a question not too long ago about spending $100 to access beta, and all I could think was make it $250 easy. It's hard to put a value on what is essentially Classic WoW Seasons. Currently capped at level 30 for long enough to get something out of. It's a unique, once in a lifetime experience really. When the game gies live it's a rush to 60 for most, it simply won't be like this at lower levels again.
---
The obvious counter is that is not the ultimate purpose of a beta, but in order to beta test you still have to play the game, and the game looks fun as fuck right now. I have to stop watching because I'm not capable of seperating the rollercoaster of emotions I feel by missing out from the reality that it's not as big if a deal as I'm making it out to be.
---
If you do 10 quests per level, and each quest is an average 100 rep, you'll almost ready exalted by 40.
---
I'm fairly certain you'll be lucky to reach revered, though.
---
After the starting zones it's fuck-all which faction you get rep with.   
---
Crossroads has all four factions representing, and then much of the rest of the zone is Ratchet reputation.
---
Work Classic begins
---
Dude take a semester off. That's what i did back when wow first released and I still haven't gone back
---
It seems like the private server population has skyrocketed. Starting zones are packed
---
Sail to Menethil Harbor, sail to Theramore Isle, swim to Ratchet, Sail to Booty Bay, swim to Elwynn. It may not be a fast route but it is totally safe.
---
Back in the day, I built my UBRS key stealth running lbrs. I also finished the .5 tier set thanks to stealth runs. It was much quicker and easier but getting the whole process started and a reliable group of friends to do it is the real trick. If you fuck up especially getting a druid caught, you just burned all that sneak time.
---
Wow, Blizzard dropped Classic subsequent to its biggest fall off of subscribers and least sold expansion pack. What an unexpected genius business move. Crazy how they timed that right?
---
The game obviously needs more work behind the scenes.  They hotfixed stuff while people were playing.  
---
I honestly don't think the game has enough polish on the systems to handle a large beta of seasoned players, there would be too many bug reports over known issues I suspect.
---
Theory:  When the level 40 closed beta starts, lots of 'players' will get in.
---
Blizzard needs hype right now, BFA is failing, and they need to float into their 3rd quarter with people trickling back into wow.  Just go make a new character on a decent server, and you will see a ton of new players or returning players waiting for classic.
---
The one I play on went from an average of 400 to 1900. So yes, the beta affected the population quite substantially.
---
Can't go fire for the first two raid tiers. Everything is immune to fire until you reach AQ40
---
2003, no invite.
---
People.offered up to 1000$ for an Beta invite.
---
And that was while blizz was still handing out invites.
---
Can only imagine prices are going craty since the announcement they pretty much have all testers.
---
My favorite is Cannibalize being on 3
---
that’s what i’ve seen people say. ill def just wait i think don’t wanna ruin it before it even comes out. TY!
---
Next stresstest aka sitting in front of the login screen for 3-5 hours.
---
Just right-click report anyone who is ganking you, thats literally what the feature is for.
---
There is no true MMO to tide you over because popular MMORPGs were born and died with World of Warcraft. WoW, in an ironic twist of fate, will be the fabled "WoW Killer"
---
Will they up the level cap from 5 tho?
---
Layering on launch, dynamic respawns (confirmed from interviews and clips from previous days) means that starting zones wont be a problem.
---
Guild recruitment mainly.
---
For me I could tell BFA was worse than both Legion and WoD just from the leveling. I mean I had a great time, but there were like 10 different warning signals that were going off in my brain that I had to ignore while leveling and all of them ended up being valid.
---
not really caring too much about DPS, just wanted to know if it was viable for me to play one since it's been like, my main for so many years lol
---
How does taking a "you're useless for 10 minutes" debuff help me not waste time? That's the opposite of what I want.
---
There was a confirmation, that names will be new.
---
I'd say that it's all relative... I remember I levelled my priest alongside an Irl warrior friend and we would often beat players around our own lvl, as long as there were only 2-3 of then at most.
---
That's pretty cool, I've played a lot of mmo's and haven't heard of anything like this. Surprised I haven't heard of this from world of warcraft actually, although I suppose this was a long time ago.
---
What do you mean by at least until the gates open?
---
Imagine training an AI to shitloads of these images and then let it convert a wow video in the same style.
---
What’s TFW you get your main and you’re on a different ‘Layer’?
---
Just to pick up a quest later that asks you to go back.
---
Priest and Warrior are both Hybrid classes.
---
y tho?
---
Why should there be no argument against the marketing being wrong? Everyone is entitled to their honest opinion. Classic WoW would be just as successful without many of these marketing ploys. Doesn't make it sit well with many of the consumers. After all, it's only happening because of said consumers...
---
Feel like vanilla* - and yes. You are 100% correct
---
Patch 2.0: In PvP, Crowd Control effects will last no longer than 12 seconds instead of the full duration, with a chance of a heartbeat resist.
---
This is me. I came back just to see what class I wanna play and now I'm addicted to mage. Will gladly level again as a mage as well. I find the class extremely fun and haven't played a mage past like level 20 or 30 ever before.
---
People are practicing up. So they can be prepared for classic. Though they are quite different. I played a bit on the stress test and a lot of values on the pservers are off. I can't wait for classic.
---
Level 21 ally on a server and redridge/darkshore are fucking packed.
---
Damn, that’s the exact point I stopped. I did recently come back during BfA tho.
---
They are already planning on releasing vanilla with sharding afiak but I think they will phase it out shortly after launch. I think it's just a launch thing at least...
---
Maybe to some, but at least in my country school used to start around the 15th of September, and college around 1st of October.
---
Artificial scarcity promotes hype for the actual launch.
---
The AQ gate scepter quest is going to bring SO MUCH drama.
---
I disagree. I think it started towards the end of TBC or the end of WotLK with the trials/tournament. Great raids throughout, though.
---
Fun, feeling of power simultaneously taking on bosses and a leadership role. Taking or avoiding huge hits and controlling a fight is rewarding to people. Holding threat is a game in itself, with a lot of challenge and complexity.
---
Loot priority for some of the best items, loot priority for warrior tier gear - you get geared up hella fast. If you prove yourself to be an asset, you will receive more attention from your guild and be far less replaceable than just another DPS.
---
There can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of eyes on the beta and those people can all bring bugs to Blizzard's attention.
---
 2. Guaranteed video evidence of bugs.
---
 3. They can play 18 hours a day therefore more hours of data for Blizzard.
---
 4. Of course hype.
---
Extremely late, but I played Druid in vanilla. Druids are the best WSG flag carriers and very durable healers. Not as durable as paladins but still very hard to disable or focus, and less likely to run out of mana. Entangling roots acts as good crowd control against Warriors and Rogues. Also you'll get feral charge allowing you to stop enemy spells at crucial moments and get you some space from melee at the same time.
---
They aren't known for AoE healing but Tranquility is amazing when it's off cool-down and can easily let you swing zerg vs zerg battles. Your raid is almost unkillable if you're allowed to channel it.
---
In wpvp they have a distinct advantage with cat form stealth and humanoid tracking. Rogues and Mages make for great partners.
---
Other classes will be better for healbotting a warrior — druid buffs are very weak and they're unable to save their partners from being shut down with crowd control.
---
I'm strongly considering Shaman this time around because Druids hardly do any damage in heal specs, and feral runs out of mana instantly. Balance is a meme. Leveling and farming as Resto was a nightmare.
---
I’ll consider the following categories:
---
Duels, casual bg, premade bg, Solo wpvp, mass world pvp.
---
I’ll say that this is my subjective view.
---
Top tier:
---
Hunter 
---
Mage
---
Solid:
---
Rogue
---
Warlock
---
Shadow priest
---
Druid
---
Below average:
---
Ele shaman / resto ele hybrid
---
Ret paladin
---
Warrior
---
Bottom tier:
---
Enhancement shaman
---
Flying mounts were the single biggest thing that killed the community feeling and engagement in WoW.
---
Once the gates open (war efforts is finished and gong is rung by at least one player), the AQ20 and AQ40 raids will be available on that server for everyone. They are not available until then.
---
practice makes perfect i guess
---
If this is about having the ability to jump off at the next FP I’d rather they do without it and revert it!
---
I don't understand why people like you come in to these threads and "explain" why big streamers got beta access.  It is good marketing for the game.  We get it.  The fact that you think this is super secret and profound knowledge is hilarious.  You're missing the point.
---
Because you have to work harder for a mediocre toon. Never topping dps/hps charts. Have to collect 3 different gear sets. Like rolling proffesions just to drop them once you have your bis item at 300? roll druid.
---
Very fun and versitle class though...
---
&gt; Classic WoW would be just as successful without many of these marketing ploys. 
---
You don't understand marketing. Maybe... go into landscaping or something like that.
---
LOL!
---
TRUTH tho
---
To be more clear, it won't be dynamic respawns like on p servers where there's a new mob spawning every 30 seconds.
---
Dynamic respawns means that a new mob will spawn every 2-3 minutes instead of every 5 minutes.
---
Launch will definitely still be a problem.
---
&gt;The modern wow designers haven't got that insight any more apparently, and the game is worse for it. The fact that the game has constantly lost subscribers over the years, despite efforts to make the game even more accessible and convenient during that time, proves this.
---
It might have even a slight chance of proving anything, IF other mmos had appeared and overtaken WoW.
---
They have not.
---
So as it stands, it just appears the genre as a whole is pretty dead, relative to when WoW was at its peak.
---
Either NOBODY is capable of making fun games, or the market for mmos has just shrank and people are less interested. Hence why less are getting made.
---
Beta has actually increased pserver pops
---
&gt; Please note upload date.
---
&gt; 
---
Am I missing something here or does the update show it happened *in* Classic? 2.0.1 dropped December and this upload date is November. They are using the correct 1.12 values, and should stick with that animation.
---
Solid - thanks for sharing! Definitely rolling Troll Priest w/classic so this grew the hype that much more for me.
---
never forget, ToC was when wow caught the activision plague.
---
 "look how they massacred my boy..." :(
---
Turning gaming into a job did that.
---
FLYING didn't kill the game as much as spreadsheets and DPS charts did.
---
We all remember WoW with fond opinions because we werent analyzing how to play from other people's experiences. We were just playing it. You weren't reading what talent nodes to pick or what BiS armor to farm. You just ran dungeons and got what you got. Or you ran through the world and saw what you saw.
---
Because it makes it seem like a hunter is reapplying the mark every 2 seconds
---
Fuck the griphons, they look better that the wyverns, have you seen how terrible they look? 100% agreed. And it scares me, because in the spirit of all things new blizzard does it exactly fits the lazy theme of all their games rn. Have you also seen the monstrousity of animation sylvanas had in their last ingame cinematic? It looks 10 times worse than a fan made. Sadly blizz really turned into a money milking factory and they care little about flavour details nowadays. Just shows here, when with the with the old tech they had in 2004 they did a better job than now in 2019.
---
Yep, welcome to WoW Classic.
---
MC, at least, is genuinely faceroll. I had heard this, but I was really stunned the first time I went in.
---
Right after taking the screenshot went to  pick up the nearest dreamfoil. Got cheapshotted and dotted simultaneously.
---
The answer is because it's the one thing left in WoW I've never done before. I want to attack Classic with a completely new playstyle and mindset to the one I've always had in Retail.
---
That and I think it's going to be a good challenge. The fact everybody always says "people usually reach a point in classic tanking that makes them change their mind and reroll" just makes me lean into it harder.
---
Would I want to pay a lot of money, yeah. would I, no. It's a beta for a game that will be out before summer is over, I can wait a little.
---
They sell out in 5 seconds anyway
---
Im just thankful I had a computer in bedroom as a child so I bathed in the golden age of memes and forums. I was born mid 90s so a lot of my friends have no idea of the good old days
---
And how do we know 1 layer Will hold as many players as a whole realm? If they are smart they cap each layer at like 1k and have many of them, then instead of merging all at once they can merge some after a few weeks and so on
---
This is a total myth. A good hunter in a good guild who has been raiding regularly in MC, BWL, ZG, AQ40....isn’t going to suddenly be looked over by their guild. 
---
Hunters need less healing, and a good hunters DPS isn’t too far off the mark even in Naxx.
---
Just be a good player, Max your consumables, pots, elixirs food buffs etc, be on time for raids, help support your guild, and you’ll be raiding Naxx.
---
Except those thousand eyes wont watch a minute of actual gameplay.
---
I respectfully disagree. The charts and meters were already present in Classic but they never broke the community feeling in WoW. And all will also be there for WoW Classic but it won't interfere with the community feeling and engagement. Private servers are a good example of that.
---
Wyverns are way worse looking.
---
Add another one to the list, boys!

That might be your experience.  I had tons of meaningful and memorable WPvP on those private servers. Fighting equal leveled alliance over quest objectives and nodes was amazing, and some epic 5v5 fights outside dungeons. Much more memorable than questing to 60 for the 50th time. And yes you do get ganked unfairly sometimes, but trying to avoid a 60 killing you was sometimes part of the fun. And I killed a level 60 as a 51 Paladin with a huge gnomish death ray crit!
---
cLaSsIc SuMmEr!
---
&gt; You could just not use flying, but then you're taking an hour to get somewhere that could just take ten minutes.
---
When Flying was first introduced, it moved at +60% movement speed and it was, in fact, faster to stay on the ground.
---
I did this in vanilla and tBC, and it was fine worked well. You can gear up your alts well and get good xp for the alt just aoe grinding mobs on the level 60
---
You know nothing
---
Would it be right for Blizzard to fix the problem on one faction and not the other? Of course not. So you fix both.
---
Is she logged on? Is her character in the world? No matter what she does, as long as she's playing, she's going to be giving data to Blizzard. Even if she just casually quests in the starting zone, that's still more data for Blizzard.
---
It's good because she might do quests or explore places or kill mobs that veterans might not do because they know it's a "waste of time"  because they wanted to level efficiently.
---
How does skinning benefit tailoring?
---
Relax it was a joke Jesus
---
you could get warrior tanks in vanilla pretty easy... just not warrior tanks you wanted. vanilla tanking requires you to be great or the group/raid suffers and not a lot of tanks were great.
---
not only is tanking a fine balance game and in raid doing so is done in a co-op manner so you need to be intune with your OTs. you also get constantly fucked by misses, parries, dodges and resists (taunt can resist) and you as a tank need to be able to adjust on the fly and save the situation inorder to keep the balance all while leading the raid.
---
all this means is that there are warrior tanks but most of them are not up to the unique task that is tanking.
---
Man, do not level as prot. If you have nonstop personal healer by you while leveling you will be able as dps specced to clear insanely fast with her......and you can tank any dungeon till 60 perfectly well anyway
---
what's a good pserver? for vanilla
---
There was epic flying, even in TBC.
---
Also, 60% flying is still faster if you consider you can skip mobs, world pvp, barriers, etc.
---
Respectfully, I think it would be disgraceful for it not to be fixed. I don’t think I’m a particularly entitled player and I’m used to a lot of jank. I don’t expect 0 bugs or discrepancies on launch. I do expect this one to be sorted. 
---
You spend a lot of time on flight paths, usually several flights per play session lasting 2-10 minutes each. There’s nothing to do ingame at that time except take in the visuals. With 3 months left, there’s no excuse to ignore this. No, it shouldn’t be a hard fix.
---
It was just a little joke and meme :( 
---
I guess this sub is in triggermode now with all the jealousy
---
Barrens chat is what twitch chat wouldve been if it was around at the time.
---
Look into donating plasma, you’re doing something good and paying for your subscription with a very little time commitment.
---
Did he get a new keyboard yet?
---
Yeah, whiners everywhere 😄
---
Beta would be neat I guess, but it get's you nothing, it gets wiped I am not sure why people are heart broken over not getting it. Is it to practice? Or something else? It's a test, not a trial account.
---
&gt;Call me salty because I didn't get beta access. Say I'm a mouth breathing loser.
---
Sure thing. You are a salty, mouth-breathing loser.
---
We're all giving this guy shit but I think the jokes on us.  Withhis current improvement curve, by the time launch rolls around he's actually going a Blizzard Graphical Artist.
---
Because this whole "Blizzard is shady, they're only giving beta access to streamers"-narrative is like a weed that keeps cropping back up.
---
What I'm saying is nowhere near profound to most people - but these dunces who keeps singing this same old tune apparently need to be told a million times before they understand it.
---
To reiterate:
---
# BLIZZARD WANTS CLASSIC PROMOTED. STREAMERS HAVE LARGE AUDIENCES. LARGE AUDIENCES MEANS MORE PROMOTION.
---
/thread
---
Its not just about raw damage, hunters bring stuff to a raid that make you quite wanted to a extent.
---
dude need to chill, I am not demanding for a fix, I am merely pointing out something which I felt was different from what I experienced 14 years ago, and wanted to check with other vanilla players if this was an intended change that happened or not.
---
Shadowhunter, shadowhunterx, shadowhunterxx, shadowhunterxxx
---
slow clap, have an upvote
---
Ret is a great PvP spec, lol.
---
Create you own adventure, no super guides or addons or ways to play from veterans. I played in 04 and it was a blast just going and being random
---
The orc is screaming but is showing up in raid chat... be sure to report bug plz
---
poaching along with the need to run previous raids is what forced top guilds to work with the rest of the community. if a top guild forces the naxx geared people all to run MC for thunderfury for a OT so the run is quick that shuts the door for pugs to get gear and you end the upwell of new blood for the tier 2 raiding guild which you are sucking dry.
---
it also means you can't be a dick to anybody as it can bite you in the ass down the line.
---
I don't want to get counter sniped, so I can't reveal
---
When people ask about viability they usually are referring to either DPS/Tank/Healing/PvP ability. Since Hunters can only DPS, I assumed that's what you were wondering.
---
Every class is viable if you just want to play the game, so I guess I need to know what you mean by viable...
---
They are raid viable with or without the melee trick I mentioned, but I thought it was neat that so many people missed it including myself. I watched a Naxx video of a Hunter doing it properly and he was just below the Rogues in damage, it was cool to see.
---
I'm only concerned that that's going to give me bad habits for when I do try and transition to tanking full time down the line. I've legit never ever tanked in the 13 years I've played. Have zero inherent know-how. Sort of hope that by using prot constantly as I level some of the mob management will rub off on me overtime. But maybe I'm overthinking it entirely.
---
It seemed like you were trying to discredit my statement lol js
---
I mean, I "figured" them, I played on some of the vanilla, TBC and some of the Wotlk servers, actually I was on one of those first completely broken Wotlk PvP servers with insta 80 to try PvP with some classes I didn't have at max level on retail back in 2009-2010. 
---
I gave up on it didn't like their community, especially these days. Some of them are incredibly toxic I hope and I believe will stay on those servers. Some servers also had changes I didn't like, especially balancing. And of course I didn't like the fact it might shut down one day, like Nost.
---
I played on some of the pservers in WoD, then in Legion I completely ignored them because the expansion was good, and now in BfA I tried some, but nah. I'll wait for the real Classic with BfA and other games, but not with pservers.
---
I've never been addicted to pservers, altough I've tried fair amount of them. Altough I love vanilla, changing gameplay and community were big nope from me.
---
I’ve never ever heard of someone being rejected from a group for being a nelf. I’d be totally shocked to hear someone give that as a reason for not letting someone in a group. 
---
EVEN in cases where we wanted dwarf priest for fear ward, we’d still take another priest if they were there first. The demand is too high.
---
NOBODY cares what race you pick for hunter.
---
Warrior is questionable, but I’ve seen enough successful nelf warriors, even in more hardcore pserver guilds, to not be worried
---
yeah this is a true classic, and considering that he posted on a new ALT warrior instead of mage, he probably made the right choice against rogue
---
Well I’m worried because the drop off rate might be too low
---
warriors make great combo leveling people however. even a rogue/warrior doing quests together is really strong
---
Warriors have healers with them in premades.
---
&gt;i just hope guilds start focusing on the player and not the class
---
This mindset is what literally, and I mean *literally*, led to the homogenization of classes in modern wow. No thanks.
---
It seems there's enough : [https://itemization.info/?search=slot%3A%27main+hand%27+slot%3Aone-hand+subtype%3Aaxe+sort%3Adps+minlevel%3A55+maxlevel%3A60#slot=main%20hand,one-hand:subtype=axe:sort=dps:minlevel=55:maxlevel=60](https://itemization.info/?search=slot%3A%27main+hand%27+slot%3Aone-hand+subtype%3Aaxe+sort%3Adps+minlevel%3A55+maxlevel%3A60#slot=main%20hand,one-hand:subtype=axe:sort=dps:minlevel=55:maxlevel=60)
---
However I don't know how to factor Thunderfury in the equation.
---
Damn, the amount of people who come from r/WoW to get offended haha
---
Don’t worry guys, maybe retail/live will be good again one day!
---
It was meant as an inside joke with a friend. He would troll our guild and LFR's by screaming IM FEARED then run in and aggro bosses and mob packs.
---
I wouldn't even watch streams.  Pretend you're in 2004.  Buy a CRT monitor and a computer that can barely run a calculator.  Seriously though, go in completely blind.
---
To be fair, that third sentence is what happened earlier as well. It's just something that becomes popular enough for people to do mass edits. Not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of those memes that followed the text picture format were often quite shit. A lot of memes are
---
the players are literally the exact same I'm not sure what you mean. toxicity is everywhere on the internet even on retail. thats just the internet culture of today, nothing to do with private server specifically.
---
Also there are plenty of servers with 0% chance of getting shut down. Nost was in france which is literally Blizzard's backyard (they have a HQ there), so of course they got hit.
---
Going to school in the US sounds unnecessarily complicated.
---
You have a good point, but...
---
Good MMOs are hard to code and even harder to design and balance. I think it could easily be argued that publishers saw that the development costs of an MMO (initial and ongoing) were too high compared to potential revenue (even if those games were extremely popular), and as such, pushed for less complex games over the last decade or so to become mainstream. 
---
The another counter argument I could make is that the Warcraft IP and Blizzard's name value have still been very attractive to gamers over the last decade. Not enough to curb bad game design from tanking sub counts, but still pretty valuable. See Overwatch at launch for example. Brand new IP, mostly the same game design as the floundering TF2, but still made a massive splash, popularity wise and revenue wise. Even good games don't get popular if they don't have a strong marketing push behind them.
---
&gt; There was epic flying, even in TBC.
---
Never denied that. But to say that flying had an immediate impact is silly. People weren't hindering themselves by staying on the ground as a fresh 70, probably less than a tenth of a percent could afford epic flying immediately. The point was that flying can be implemented (and was) in a way that it is a story-driven vehicle (it was used to get to TK + Ogri'la) rather than one of convenience.
---
"LF Tank and Healer for Shattered Halls" end up finding group of 3 DK's looking for tank...
---
just like arms is still good enough for tanking (infact i would say it is the better option)
---
one thing that is great about classic to WotLK is that you are warrior or a priest etc. first then whatever spec you are doing. today each spec might aswell be it's own class.
---
Interesting to hear pops boom, I imagine that will continue over the next 2.5 months :)
---
Keep in mind Paladin votes are only for Alliance while Priest is for both Factions. So split Priest votes in half and compare with Paladin.
---
Most important, roll what YOU want, don't choose from what others say.
---
You just reiterated what I just told you everyone already knows.
---
I mean, I bought the BlizzCon virtual ticket for the fucking demo so.....probably.
---
All the players spread across all the Pservers. That alone will be a ton of players coming back.
---
Yeah, the kinds of people responding to a poll on a Saturday night on the sub for a game that doesn't come out for three months are definitely not a randomly selected sample.
---
I'm sure the poll is accurate for some group, but it's probably not accurate for the overall population who will play classic.
---
Yeah I was considering doing the same, but I feel like starting on a PvE server kind of closes off a lot of the game to you at the end. But I guess we can always transfer later?
---
Ohhh, got it. and then that Naxx raid is the last raid of classic/vanilla and that's even harder than AQ20/40 and BWL?
---
You been living under a rock?
---
Fireland :D
---
Yeah and after 29 they would set the lvl cap to 39, so noone will get his lvl 40 talent on talent trees 😂 just to keep it clean for the brackets. And also noone wants the mount there! 
---
The og post here is again complete BS
---
Well then, if the majority is made up of randoms who just really want to play wow....that's what you want right? So....what's the problem again? Zero streamers allowed?
---
Do three server types.
---
1. BFA+ for continuing the path they went down.
---
2. Classic+ for making new Classic-like content.
---
3. Classic Pure (the server's currently in development) so that whatever Blizzard does, they can't fuck it up again, they can only fuck up the other two.
---
lul a clicker.
---
Just wait until the voidlords kill uncle owen and aunt beru
---
maybe we just framed like mad but i dont remember them being that hard to get back in vanilla, my other half had them all and i remember the constant runs through scholo so she could craft them xD
---
Looks so bad now wtf
---
Not gonna go into great detail because monkaTOS, but last night I entered a world  with 12k+ people online. Starting zones were packed and I had to wait a good 30 minutes to get Hogger (there was a mage spamming Blizzard at the spawn point, what a Chad).
---
So I'd say they're doing great and are in fact booming right now, because people are so hyped about Classic they can't fight the urge to play it (such as myself). But for me, I'm using it to 'warm up' and get some of my hand/coordination skills back in check.
---
I used to stance dance like it's nobody's business but I haven't played with such determination in years, so I might need some warming up.
---
People are also using pservers to see if they'll like what Classic will bring them.
---
Always went TO tirisfall, personally.
---
Basically
---
No matter how hard they tried, post-WOTLK lore was never going to be as good, because it didn’t have as much of a foundation.
---
Can't get behind calling them shady.
---
It's the beta to a game that releases in less than 100 days.
---
If there is anything to take away from streamers having access is the reality of launch - normal people like you and me won't be able to keep up (not that we have to) but the ungodly hours they have put into a beta is nothing compared to what they'll do at launch. 
---
A big positive to take away is to see that there is interest (yes, obviously) but that wasn't a guarantee just a month ago... I haven't watched shroud play the beta but I would imagine the hooks have sunk in and he'll be playing on launch too.
---
How long would it take you to earn the money for a sub? Compare that to how long it would take you turn earn the gold? Do which ever one takes less time.
---
check /r/wowservers they have a list of them on there, its where i found the one for my classic fix until 27/8
---
World first!
---
will be interesting to see what their population looks like after the first 2 weeks of classic being live
---
fuck YES!
---
Lol that comment made me laugh
---
For sure don't bother with BFA, too many quality of life changes since Vanilla 15 years ago that it's just better to not even see them :)
---
One thing I can't stress enough is make sure you guys don't feel rushed to level, make gold, get professions up etc... just enjoy the zones - learn the quests, talk to strangers and have fun!
---
mostly drop rates are different at lower levels, have 6 and 8 slot bags dropping every 3-4 kills on the server i'm on, not got higher level to check damage numbers on a private server but good chance they will be off compared to classic live
---
I think some of them have confirmed to be shutting down, at least the bigger one did?
---
Farming herbs or what!?
---
Sad part is - August 13th will be name reservations but I'm pretty sure anyone in the closed beta will get to keep their names without having to reserve on 8/13.
---
No official word but why wouldn't they :)
---
Activision blizzard was founded 5 months prior to the release of wotlk though.
---
Dun Morogh? I dunno bud, how much "Get me beer/boar/furs" quests do you need to be introduced to the dwarves?
---
Can we just hol up a second and think about how fucking cool this is? Massive, great flying mythical creatures carrying their leisurely passengers around Azeroth.
---
Last night just as I was crossing the main road that goes through Elwynn I almost got hit by 3 Gryphons one after another, swooping so close to the road it raised a dust cloud. And they were hauling ass, too! I stopped and just said, w O w! 
---
It gave me an idea of a great painting; the forest as a background, with the road in the foreground with some small roadside fences and a Gryphon passing by just inches away from the road, with wings wide spread and tilted at a precise 45 degree angle because *it wanted to be inverted*. Water painted.
---
Barack Obama referred to it as "lead singer syndrome"
---
Dude you need to make a speedpainting video of your next project
---
Top kek
---
Yeah, other classes have to fill bags with consumables such as mana pots but warlocks can generate mana out of life and drain it back if threat allows (or let healers deal with it).
---
Feral druids have to stock up on crowd pummelers from gnomeregan to deal decent dps. You are right, soul shards don't take space by accident. It's by design.
---
&gt;Good MMOs are hard to code and even harder to design and balance. I think it could easily be argued that the big publishers saw that the development costs of an MMO (initial and ongoing) were too high compared to potential revenue (even if those games were extremely popular), and as such, pushed for less complex games over the last decade or so to become mainstream.
---
Either the growth wow saw was going to continue, or maintain, or it was not.
---
If you believe it was not then wows decline is inevitable. If you believe it was, then on balance of probability another mmo (MANY were made) should have taken over had people actually wanted it.
---
Yes, mmos aren't cheap nor are they easy. MANY were made and they all failed. Even the most successful ones were only a fraction of WoW. 
---
If the money was there in a traditional mmo, people wouldn't have abandoned every single new mmo so quickly.
---
(virtually) nobody these days would choose to make an mmo given the money.
---
The same way that RTS games are far less commonly made, and I don't think anyone making them expects a huge payday like with SC or WC.
---
&gt; Warcraft IP and Blizzard's name value have still been very attractive to gamers over the last decade.
---
I would say this is partially the IP, but mainly just that Blizzard is a very large company that can afford marketing, and gets marketing for free.
---
However, when other mmos like Rift/Wildstar etc came out they were VERY hyped and everyone knew about them. 
---
Further to that, in order to fund making an MMO you need a lot of money. You generally don't put that much in and NOT market your game.
---
I don't really believe that the IP aspect is prohibitive either.
---
Prior to WoW I would argue that although the Warcraft series and SC were very popular, it was FAR less so than when WoW came out.
---
With new MMOs the hype was always there, and people didn't seem to be bothered that it wasnt a warcraft IP.
---
&gt;Overwatch
---
They took a tried and tested formula (TF2), added popular IP, and extremely high levels of polish and stability (servers etc) as well as marketing and ongoing support.
---
Again though, it had new game hype. As did all the MMOs that came out. 
---
Only a fraction of the people who started playing OW still play OW now. It's still successful, but I would argue that the bar for success is far lower compared to the numbers that you speak of for WoW.
---
It is also a FAR more casual and easy drop in/out game and DOES NOT have a monthly sub cost.
---
Your argument of the IP in terms of WoW doesn't really make that much sense when you stop to think about it too. If IP has say a 30% chance to stop someone leaving (silly number, but think of the concept) then that is a flat value. If the game were good or bad the IP would still be the IP and it would still have that effect.
---
Now, what would devalue the IP and reduce that %age? That is not a simple question with a simple answer at all, unfortunately. Yes, one factor might be 'poor design choices' in wow, but that would be only one factor and may not even be a remotely important one.
---
You've completely dodged addressing your numbers re. the mmo market itself. And of commenting on the actual market for vanilla like mmos and how healthy that is over all.
---
At least there's some unique points made.     
---
Oh wait there isn't
---
gotem
---
Finals, vacation and as much social stuff as you can thing of. Cause when it arrives you would probably rather play then go to a party. So enjoy the summer as much as you can so you are completely charged for the launch
---
nice! ty
---
Look at what they do with seasons in Diablo 3 today. They start a new season, and season players are separate from non-season. At the end of the season, the season characters get rolled in with the non-season characters and it forms a single character base. Then they start a new season and the process begins anew.
---
This process maintains at most two separate character bases, and nobody loses their characters during a new season. They're just separated from the fresh season players for a while.
---
I think this would be the way to reset classic every couple of years.
---
Note that D3 has special perks every season, and I am not suggesting that should happen in classic wow seasons. The season would simply be a clean reset that you could choose to play in or not.
---
You totally misunderstood and went after this guy for no reason 🙄
---
It is easier to do some IRL work to make that money. It is like 7-10 hours of work to get enough money for whole year subscription. Don't think you will make gold for whole years sub in that time. Just my thought ofc. To answer your question i think it is possible to make enough gold in retail to pay sub (if you know what you are doing). The time investment propably will not be worth i though.
---
I would play wow if it was 32 bit pixel graphics lol I think that would look cool.
---
Less favoritism. But ye u right.
---
Do you play on NA or EU? Token prices are different depending on your region.
---
https://wowtoken.info/
---
Right now tokens are ~185k on EU and ~120k on NA.
---
Let's assume you play on EU. 185k per month is only ~6.2k gold per day. You can absolutely make more than 6.2k gold per day without putting too much effort into it.
---
You can easily farm this kind of gold simply by farming herbs and ore, but there are many other ways to make gold in WoW.
---
I personally make all my gold exclusively by playing the auctionhouse. One easy way to make gold is to buy consumables and current content materials slightly below their market value and then to resell them in different convenient stacksizes at a slight premium.
---
Assuming that roughly 20% of your sales will be profit, you'd only need to get like 31k gold in sales per day to pay for your monthly token, which is easily doable.
---
If you want to learn more about goldmaking, you might want to join the woweconomy subreddit and/or discord server - lots of active goldmakers discussing goldmaking and helping newer players there.
---
Good luck!
---
warriors scale with gear better than any other class this is true in vanilla it is true in retail. however in vanilla the gear needed to start becoming insane was very low get that dungeon gear and a solid weapon and you will be on the top of the charts. infact the good warrior weapon is later on a rubber stamped assurance with the iced barbed spear and unstoppbal force which is in part why warrior is never bad once you reach 60.
---
Just playing the game: doing dailies, professions, missions with followers, WQs, AH market etc. It’s easier if you have alts but don’t level one from 1 to 120 just for 2 months. It’s really easy to make gold in bfa
---
And I don't think anyone understands why we need to see the same thread about "STREAMER GOT INVITE BUT I DIDNT", or variations of it.
---
It's already 1.13.
---
A mob spawns when one dies and there are only a few left - in vanilla at a certain point it was impossible to clear the starting area regardless of how many people were killing mobs. I did several fresh servers then.
---
Yes
---
So for not having played vanilla and already doing some private servers - retro wow is a good way to give classes at 60 a try if you haven't decided on a class.
---
While it's exciting waiting for classic I'd say the best thing would be to completely forget about it until August.
---
Easier said than done but will be worth it, do everything you possibly can that you won't do in september...  be outside for as long as possible, read some books, exercise, spend time with people.
---
It's very easy to get sucked in and when October hits and we are all so vitamin d sufficient and haven't spoken to some non gaming friends in some time - we'll be glad we did it before classic existed :)

---
&gt; Its an old game with fixed content, that naturally makes it hard to make an interesting stream.
---
Not a problem because, to me, streaming is _intrinsically_ uninteresting.
---
Ah, a man of culture also i see.
---
&gt; It worked great for osrs.
---
Has it? The OSRS voting system is a total meme. Anyone who plays OSRS knows it's become a formula for casuals to ruin the game while serious players nit-pick every decision and **Jagex ends up forcing updates anyways.**
---
Just ask any OSRS player about PvMers voting NO to PvP updates and vice-versa, pretty much out of spite because both groups have a visceral *hate* for each other.

just to add to this... You cannot track anything on the minimap at the expected tracking range. Track should have a pretty decent view range, yet people vanish (including mobs/npcs) before you even get close to the normal tracking range.  
---
For example. You should be able to track people in the enemy base with a hunter when you are on the ramp of the enemy base. Here, you can't bc you literally can't even target them. The visual range is way less than what it was in vanilla. It's not phasing or layering, just visual range.
---
You can always try. Why not grab that herb or mine them rocks when you see it?
---
Yeah RIP STEM majors basically. First day of class: here’s the syllabus, “you can read it on your own,” “ok, so let’s get started on the first chapter. Because today is the first day I know you couldn’t read the book material yet, but here’s a bunch of ridiculous questions about material that you never covered in your lower classes anyway!”
---
Everyone should be encouraging any and everyone to play classic - especially pvp servers :)
---
You are not saying anything.
---
We get it, you want to play rogue on easy mode.
---
Hey ty for replying. Prioritising int is something I see too and it makes the most sense to me. However it seems to run counter to what most people feel which is to stack stam/str. What do you think they are missing?
---
They obviously don't know it/refuse to recognize it when a post like this is made every 30 minutes.
---
I can only give you an objective answer if you provide more info about yourself.
---
Are you a student? Do you live at your parents' house? Are you currently working or completely free? Any other hobbies?
---
The BiS way would be find some part time work for the next ~3 months, save up all the cash, in the meanwhile spend some time with the friends and family you have (because trust me, they will stop existing for you as soon as you press the big blue Play button), and in general focus on readying yourself for the happening.
---
The money you save up will be enough to buy gametime and snacks/junk food to live off of, and the time you spend with your friends/family will compensate for the year+ of time you'd be devoid of all life except that within Azeroth.

Go out there and make it count, Billy, because one thing's for certain;... War is coming.

---
Because it lasted through all of vanilla. 
---
There’s a lot of things that could get “fixed” if you want to use that philosophy.
---
I like the fact that the minimap looks like it's a really derpy face for ragnaros
---
play on a local pserver to explore all the xp routes, get fat, grow a neckbeard, pre-sub a month in advance to avoid loaded website, train yourself to stay 18h straight sitting in a chair.
---
Keep in mind theres already been some level requirements to be wrong on these DBs, like I forget the quest name but there's a super good ring from a quest people are doing on beta. I think classicdb said it was lv35 min, but in reality they could get it at 30. Iirc some DBs said it was 30 but others said 35
---
Would really be too difficult to open another server and invite more people.................... ...
---
impossible to tell since we don't know how populated each zone will be.
---
for what it's worth, i've played through multiple pserver fresh releases and the most optimal route would always be straight up grinding. get out of your 1-4 zone ASAP and grind some more. Start questing right around lvl 10-12 or sooner if you think you have outwitted the zerg.
---
this might not be the case come release but take the info with you. just think and plan ahead in terms of getting as much exp per minute.
---
Neither. Classic should remain unchanged and serve as a time capsule for those people who get bored of retail and want a break from it.
---
If you joined retail anytime after launch, you would be at the disadvantage of everyone else having older characters, more levels, more gear. In a way you’d be playing catch-up to everyone who came before.
---
Starting at launch with everybody else evens the playing field immensely. EVERYBODY on the game starting with a fresh account hasn’t happened literally since OG launch. There’s a knowledge/skill gap, sure, but you would have that on retail anyway, and you can learn on the fly like everyone else did. But genuinely, there hasn’t been a better time to start than this since 2004. Whatever comes in later years, you can have been there at the start.
---
Grow up.
---
I played WoW retail til very recently and I'm a Whrath baby, and right now, I can't not whatch classic streams everyday. They don't represent us
---
That's how you get mega dead servers a bit/decent amount of times post naxx release
---
Scholomance can be stealthed for Argent Dawn rep and Tier 0 head pieces. It cuts a decent amount of time off the instance.
---
Princess in Maraudon can be stealthed for the pre-BIS ring.
---
A few bosses in LBRS can be stealthed, but there's really no point.
---
Pusillin in Dire Maul can be stealthed, but you'll die several times. Useful for the Crescent Key (rogues don't care).
---
The most worthwhile stealth mission is BRD. Lord Incendius drops FR gear with random enchants, Roccor drops a feral idol (though relics won't be in the game until AQ drops). Plugger drops a dagger, though it's not as good as it used to be. Most importantly, you can get about 30-50 dark iron ore per stealth run (and use the only forge where you can make Dark Iron Bars).
---
Steve Roggers 10th Sept 2011

Without a doubt. This is one of the most anticipated games to release since World of Warcraft.
---
Wasn't Nano the Nostalrius Dev?

i mean, in how much hour would you earn 13 bucks? Even considering u live in 3rd world country, cant be more than 5h . Ask yourself if u can grind a token in that time.
---
Happy cake day
---
There's a sticky thread on Mondays for guild recruitment.
---
The feel "leave me out already" comes into mind after 3 chain death grips
---
do i look like a fckin idiot?
---
Considering blizzard have already released the game for years, the number of bugs should be comparatively small, combine this with the fact that CLEARLY their decision to prioritise streamers is about advertising more than big testing and we get the reason  behind this... they aren't looking for loads of hard core players to bug hunt, they're looking for players to increase the hype for the games release....
---
And a load of players who play a ripped off version of their game for free rather than pay them wont achieve that goal
---
I'm glad to read that you decided no WoW was better than retail WoW around the MoP/WoD era. That means even without playing back then, you're a true vanilla vet at heart.
---
Which race and progressions are you going with?
---
Ostensibly yes
---
Reminds me of when a warrior on my server infamous for having 5 pocket healers and blasting consumes died. Someone in his remembrance thread posted, "Where are your health pots now??"
---
They were lucky they didnt face an all-retpally WSG
---
It's actually the [Staff of Rampant Growth](http://classicdb.ch/?item=20581) from the Dragons of the Nightmare world boss spawns. Looks similar to the BWL one, but different colors.
---
Why... why the fuck 6pm? Why not 6am?
---
Yeah, I also linked reddit post just in case for more info.
---
Not even max lvl
---
Priest has just magic ranged DD and healing and their damage part suffers PvE wise. Even more now that people are favoring shadow-weaving offhealing builds.
---
Just add an option to use new or old then. I’m personally more concerned with the gameplay being the same as Vanilla more than graphics. To me, this could be a graphical remaster instead of a re-release.
---
That isn’t how you care to see it, and that’s fine. Give us both the option to pick how we see the world.
---
&gt;It's probably an easy enough fix, I would imagine.
---
And in the professional world the rest of the conversation goes something like 
---
&gt; I'll slot in a few hours on this task. That should be enough.
---
And the programmer's shrieks of pain can be heard throughout the land.
---
I don't get the question, regardless of what the rates are compared to private servers - there will be 100x more competition.
---
You'll have to decide on leveling gather or questing - zero possibility of keeping it up with your level unless you specifically take time to stop questing and just level gathering.
---
Another note - hitting 60 then gathering won't make it "easier" when it comes to competition, mount of course will help but 100% of the time nodes will be picked up withing minutes if not seconds of the nodes popping up.
---
The Tier armour is what made me finally opt for Paly over Priest.
---
idgaf all these comic shitstorm going around today sry. not everyone a fanboi
---
I'm amazed by these self righteous people who've been playing the game for 14 years and are ready to come in and report every bug they see. Like dear lord how important do you think you are.
---
legit laugh, send url
---
Good job!
---
I too have been sharing this, eu forum, some bug topics and ticket to Blizzard.
---
I used to do that with my cousin (priest and warlock), but we were T1 or T2.
---
Also, some friends on kirin Tor EU server cleaned the dungeon starting with no gear, they were allowed to wera only what they looted inside. I remeber they made it to the front page in the news on the WoW EU site. That was something!
---
It’s not shady. You’re just upset they are giving it to people who aren’t you. So what if someone else gets access? Your upset you can’t play and others can.
---
whats below 0?
---
Personal opinion I guess, I see competative damage and clearing things without being carried as fun.
---
while free marketing it's not great marketing, you dont give free samples to people that are already going to buy the item, and before anyone goes "but how do you know they are going to buy it" they are watching wow streamers because they like wow its not that hard to work out, they would be better off giving beta to some streamers, and base it on their content not viewer numbers, people like asmongold and some of the others that just scream all the time shouldn't get it people that actually do work on their streams like joana and nobbel should have been in the first wave of streamer beta, and doing F&amp;F like normal,
---
then the other beta invites should go out to people that played early and may not have played in awhile, maybe send them an email inviting them and if it's not taken within so many hours send the key else where, that way you would get back subs that have been gone awhile rather than just getting people that are already subbed, this would mean that you would see a bigger increase in numbers than what we will see from the current model of "marketing"
---
That depends heavily by course. Art course... sure. Chemistry or math or something? You’ll be loaded up with plenty to study by end of day 1 or 2 or if you’re lucky. You’ll have quizzes end of the week or the beginning of second week to worry about.
---
Wrong, it was changed in the pretbc patch 2.0
---
no tree in classic
---
4:3 is part of the charm.
---
I’m right there with you on that. Priest leveling is a whole lot of fun and you can jump into a dungeon group at any time.
---
sounds like serious ptsd
---
Hi, /u/RealisticKiwi
---
Thank you, I’m in love. All the internet should be like this. I can’t even read a news article anymore without all these slidy pop ups and everything. It all went backwards. But the design of this is perfect
---
the only use i see would be for twinking. Much easier to boost urself in dungeon from lvl 1
---
&gt;It wasn't possible back then to make an MMO that had hitscan attacks or dodging. If they could have. They would have.
---
Completely baseless speculation.
---
No one said anything
---
Very common in fact, from my sample size.
---
Why did they never used some mechanics with NPCs (or even AH) to incite players to "change" the main capital cities? Thunder Bluff, Darnassus were nice cities but uner populated, it always made me sad.
---
I wouldn't mind new content after classic but im sceptic if they can keep the spirit. 
---
I would love TBC, its my favourite version of the game.
---
They were present for a small portion of those that were hard core af, nowadays even the casuals got dps meters and bis lists n shit.
---
I don't think flying mounts were overall good for the game, but they are definitely put on a pedestal.
---
exactly. which is why they are not bottom tier in my list.
---
they are great in premades they are great in the rare occassion of a mass world pvp with a pocket healer.
---
they are literally bottom of the barrel solo in duels, casual bg and world pvp
---
That’s how you see it, and that’s not necessarily wrong. I personally would like Classic to have the gameplay of vanilla with graphical remastering (to me, the gameplay is what provides the feel, not 15yo graphics). IMO, give us the option to see it how it used to be (with low res polygons skating around) or with new models (higher res models and stealth that doesn’t skate). It literally won’t affect the gameplay and will allow us each to enjoy the visuals we prefer.
---
Dynamic respawns are not based on time, you are talking about static respawns which are simple timers after mob dies. Dynamic respawns are based on how many people are killing those mobs, how fast are they killing them.
---
Sounds like me when I was in college
---
Are you speaking from vanilla experience or pvt server experience?
---
10 weeks paternity? That's awesome, where do you live that allowed this?! Also, congratulations.
---
i streamed a small part of like the 3rd one last week. Was only to show a friend what i was using.  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427299858##](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427299858##)
---
why are those 60s so bad?
---
Enemy cast bars existed in vanilla. I dunno what that guy is talking about.
---
However, enemy cast bars had the limit of only reading the combat log, which didn't tell you the spell rank. So addons had to guess how long the cast would be.
---
There's only one reason to be against streamers: being jelous because you treat the beta as a demo.
---
Streamers are still reporting tons of bugs, give many people without access some form of access, have video evidence of everything they do (what allows people that don't play to find bugs a streamer missed) and lastly they build hype. Do you think the 200 people battle in arathi would've randomly been organized? It could've happened (it did in classic every now and then), but streamers actually made it happen.
---
There's absolutely nothing negative about it, apart from probably \~500 invites not being send out to random people that think they "deserve" to play the beta.
---
If people stopped treating the beta as a demo and realize that streamers do more for a **beta** than most normal people ever could they wouldn't be so salty.
---
This is the right play unless you are going to play right at release and dont have the backing to be your guild's enchanter, in which case its going to be tough to find a wand before 15ish.
---
No it's not lol
---
Same. I moved 8 times in 12 years, most of that due to layoffs. But I'm back in the area where I grew up. I'm definitely going to take my time with classic and enjoy the ride.
---
When you say "get out of 1-5 zone asap", do you mean by grinding in the zone, or running out at lvl 1 and group grinding on lvl 6 mobs?
---
month at least, depends how many rogues in the roster
---
I've just followed you. You should definately stream it, ill 100% tune in! :D
---
Ty for onslaught girdle btw
---
Stop gatekeeping.
---
And, world buffs in SW.
---
Not you specifically, but if you read the forums over the years you'd see.
---
Some of the healers have similar taxes along the hybrid tax itself. 
---
Paladins are slow as hell leveling-wise, the same goes for shaman. Priests aren't the fastest either, but at least they have a steady one. Slow and steady wins the race. 
---
Farming-wise it gets trickier as well due to being stuck in a healing spec and mostly healing gear. Not to the same point, sure, but their actual strength doesn't get to warrior levels either. 
---
Forced to tank? Lol. Say that to anyone who rolled pally expecting a "holy warrior" (taking the original class description from B) and ended as a jackass in robes. And, alongside pallies, any of the hybrids. You might want whatever, but you'll likely be forced to heal.
---
Classic is exclusive content and many ppl watch it because they can not play it.  I know many friends who dont watched retail beta because of spoilers but everyone knowsh what Classic will be so they just watch it while waiting to try it.
---
My current plan is Priest, Priest or Priest.
---
Lol you think that. Hell you could run BWL and MC right now by yourself and there’s a really good chance you wouldn’t get the full set in a month.
---
thats actually a popular opinion
---
This is a thing and it's missing from live atm. It's an old tanking skill I used to use to move mobs that you can no longer do.
---
Bottom left: https://imgur.com/5QBrvDq
---
Re-read my sentence and see I agreed with you, dumbass
---
Only if you compete for server firsts, otherwise race is irrelevant.
---
&gt;/cast !Auto Shot
---
Doesn't work either
---
What about arcane mages? Everyone forgets about arcane mages 😟
---
Pepega
---
i know the one that started the whole classic debate at blizzard, cant type their name since my spelling is bad, has already closed down, looked into them last night and some of their players where over the moons some were less than happy xD
---
What limits rogue to be in god tier?
---
Yes, unless you accept being a healer. Then you're a god.
---
Yeah, I guess all the competition will make it next to impossible to maintain gathering professions without specifically going out of your way to level them. I don't know if I'll be willing to gimp my leveling efficiency for the sake of leveling mining/herbing. The goal is to hit 60 as fast as possible (ideally between 1 to 2 weeks). The thought of having the black lotuses nodes/rich thorium veins for myself for a little while is salivating.
---
Because it takes a lot of farming and a long time
---
You’d be lucky to get an epic every week raiding in the first 2 phases
---
Tank warrior is a fast gearing process, but fury warrior cant use tier gear, and has to compete with rogues for a lot of leather and weapons. I found loot shenanigans to be very frustrating as fury, as guilds wanted to prioritise rogues for certain good upgrades (daggers/leather that I needed) while not letting me roll on any plate that wasn’t well optimised - which is basically most of it in MC and BWL
---
I’m going prot for classic for ease of gearing
---
I think you misunderstand why people play "ripped off versions of their game". It's not because it's free, it's because they like the content. That's why the biggest classic private server will be shutting down on classic release.
---
Ah yes, the ol' "whine whine whine lol just meme'ing". You are the actual excrement leftover from the processing of legitimate trolling.
---
even blizzard..
---
well damn xD, think that is because it is classic and not really 1.12 but built upon the 1.12 build
---
I played Horde during vanilla days, and I always had this stereotypical thinking that alliance Paladin are just priest in plate Armor...
---
All that change when one fine day in WSG when I got rekt by a Ret pally with a Hand of Rag equppied.
---
I wonder if transferring realms is possible, because then speedlevelers will do on pve servers and then transfer at 60.
---
Quit school, learn to code. You'll make more money and get to play wow.
---
I did, and tbc, and again in nostalrius.
---
Don't think this is a big issue tbh, either way works for me and it's not something I think would alter the classic experience.
---
F
---
no im not interested in any modern blizzard products
---
id pay 30-50 for a classic collectors edition that gave a pet and access but im never buying blizzcon virtual tickets
---
Yeah but Pservers are full of Min/maxing no lifers who are just there to get first KT kill and then move onto a new F R E S H. Pservers have a tendency to attract more hardcore players, casual players are under-represented.
---
I think with Classic, we may actually see more Underdog Specs. At this point we know everything about the raids and mechanics, yeah a Boomkin may not be as good as a Mage, but if you’re not going for Hardcore Competitive Progression, it doesn’t matter that much.
---
I could be wrong, but I hope not!
---
i think it would be nice to go down a different route to what they took with retail but only after the servers are showing decline, no point changing something that is working. and i dont mean expansions i mean adding in lost content that was planned for vanilla but scrapped in favor of TBC.
---
that way if they then decide to make a TBC server they could do the same for that, sort of getting it to the pinnacle of what it could have been had they not rushed to finish it off in favor of the next expansion
---
It says that a macro script has been blocked from an action available only to the Blizzard UI.
---
from my own experience, playing as orc/troll;
---
i'd grind to level 2 or 3 solo depending on how populated the zone is, then go towards tiragarde keep and link up with friends or random players who were having the same plan. these mobs are level 5-6 IIRC so perfectly doable as a two or three man stack. you might be able to do it at level 1 as a full group but i don't know if it'd be viable exp wise. someone reading this might know.
---
after doing this for a few levels i'd bail the group since durotar is a big zone full of nice grinding spots out of the way. i'd change to questing if the zone wasn't too packed but the launches i played through always had at least 6000 people on the server so i mostly grinded straight to 12, except for doing my class quest(s). right around in the barrens i'd start questing but still i'd skip some if the spot was too crowded or the quest i needed to do had a slow respawner, etc.
---
now take everything with a grain of salt because pservers aren't exactly the same as classic and we still don't know how the launches will look like. but good info nonetheless. if you see that your starting zone is FUBAR, forget about quests and start grinding like you're playing a free to play korean MMO.
---
Top notch argumentation right there
---
Nowadays you get the cops called on you
---
don't give them ideas on how to get more money out of us hoping for beta
---
That's not classic, them skins... no no.
---
You want to lvl to 60 with help from everyone so you need to do less and have it easier? 
---
There is a better way! Just hire some speedlevel guy, he gets you to 60 asap and you can enjoy the time outside! What a time to be alive! 
---
/s
---
Maybe it’s for the best if we all just choose to quit the game after 2 or 3 years
---
Do you have an idea what a disaster it would be if they actually got classic+ content *right?* there would be hordes of nolifers, ready to give up the next decade of their life to the gods of grinding. Let us go crazy for vanilla and chill out. 
---
I secretly hope they drop the ball at the end and put in microtransactions with Naxx or something equally dumb so I have an excuse to quit
---
When was the last time you played retail? The community on private servers isn't even comparable to retail no matter how bad the current expansion is, because spamming racist shit for example gets you banned there in no time. 
---
I'm used to toxicity. I watch Twitch, I used to play Dota so trust me, I know toxicity pretty well. Many people on private servers are just edgy racist shits, hateful towards each other. When discussing politics they behave like a goddamn morons. I don't give a shit if someone insults me or someone else in a group with a bad word, as I said I'm used to it, but when it happens so many times it makes you wonder what that community truly is.
---
I'd say that monthly sub keeps toxicity kinda away and I'm glad Classic will have it too. As much as I don't like retail, the community is one of the few things that can't be even comparable to private servers. I'm not saying retail doesn't have toxic shits, online games can't exist without those people. But try playing arenas, the most toxic place on retail, on let's say Wotlk private servers and then on retail. You'll see what I'm talking about.
---
And Blizzard cares about every private servers, owners are getting letters about it pretty regularly, they just ignore it which I wouldn't suggest to do, but whatever.
---
It’s going to be very annoying in large scale models
---
i took my other half telling me no its just a demo not even beta to stop me getting the ticket
---
To be honest, I expect much less toxicity in classic than on vanilla private servers
---
blizzard has marketing events before every game release
---
if they actully wanted to test there wouod be some period where you could create premade 60 characters and test for max level bugs
---
some bugs in 1-30 content does not take 3 months to check
---
I feel like the impulse to binge comes from a desire to make up for lost time with the game.
---
I might be misremembering but I thought the pets being small initially, started in TBC?
---
Enhance shaman again, it's what i started with, it's what i've mained throughout.
---
xD brilliant!
---
My GM was called Puff when I was raiding MC. I always connected to this song.
---
I recommend hireing a speedlevel guy to do the work for you. This way you can say you play WoW and enjoy RL. 
---
What a time to be alive!
---
That's how it worked in TBC at least :-)
---
The thing is that they don't actually understand it. WoW was at its peak during Wrath, but people clamored for automatic queuing systems, transmogrification, faster and more streamlined leveling and more. As soon as those things came, the subscriptions started to sink.
---
And PvPers. It just scales bad in PvE, but for PvP it's a solid choice.
---
Well, kind of! They taught the modern engine to read the old data, but not all of it was there I think, so idk...
---
Just a hypothetical, but thanks for the embellishment
---
Thanks, hopefully Blizz will look into it.
---
skyrocketed alot
---
I dunno, I agree flying can make the world feel smaller, but I don't think it killed community or interaction. I personally feel that the cross realm sharing and layering removed alot of people from the world.
---
I also think that while I like LFG system, it would have done better for the community if it was kept within the main realm or merged realms rather than across the entire continent, at least then you are more likely to meet the same people every so often.
---
If there was less sharding / cr / layering etc; youd see alot more people flying about which would make the world feel more alive.
---
But classic soon &lt;3 yay wheres my beta invite lol
---
I have a sneaking suspicion the murlock pets or polar bear mounts will be the incentive this year.
---
40 man paladin and druid raid yes please
---
My Death Knight was probably my favorite main in my entire WoW career. It was so damn fun to play, and I'm gonna miss it while playing Classic.
---
No, it was a mistake in tbc and especially in wotlk too. After you got flying, the journey ended. You might have as well ported from arbitrary point A to arbitrary point B. Before tbc, I played rogue and it always felt so good to skip something with stealth, after flying it didn't matter, just zip right in and do whatever you need.
---
Exshadowhunt
---
The server I have been playing on hit nearly 13k players last night. When I logged off at 2am there were 8700 people online.
---
Shits insane.
---
Not sure if you knew, but from Menethil, if you walk along the coast to the south and around the outsides of Loch Modan until your map updates as reading as such, drown yourself and you can res at IF. Walk a bit farther and you can res at Kharanos.
---
With only that many spells on your bars, you’d think it’s BFA
---
I believe there are no world chests that are locked (i.e. only a rogue can open them), so yes you can open them
---
Smart 😂
---
I was 30. I spent my childhood playing Jet Set Willy.
---
From my experience on the beta, grinding won't even be possible in the starting zone, unless you're in a tag group. The private servers' dynamic respawn was too good.
---
Hopefully not. Pretty sure they will wipe all data as to give everyone a chance. When I played wow beta I had to make a new character and all when finally released.
---
Not always. There are plenty of functions that have been added to the API over time.
---
You wont get my name, thief!
---
Did you read my comment? I said that the respawn times would be shorter depending on people, but I'm pretty sure that the ex-wow dev confirmed that it didn't go down to almost instant respawns. If respawns go down to 2-3 minutes minimum from 5 minutes then there will still be problems.
---
My memory might be hazy though. Im at work so I can't research right now.
---
Ill level this side, i like the aesthetic more, only thing i dont know is where ill go after atari highlands.
---
Because they said that 1 layer equals 1 realm
---
Is it Jebeli? Lol
---
There's nothing to argument more, you've been proven wrong, you just refuse to accept that you're wrong.
---
Ran Uldaman with a group, all level 42, tank was 44. The last boss was level 47. We got him down to 12 and then 3%, I (hunter) ran out of arrows, and got a new gun during the run. I hearted to if, made us all a superior health potion, some elixirs for more armor, int, agility and spell power shit. Went back in and crushed the boss.
---
My alchemy carried that fight.

\*shrug\* Play. If you like it stay playing. If you dont go do something else. Its a game not a way of life regardless of what the zealots will tell you. :)
---
You should be more concerned about how it effects the honor system. If you are queuing solo then you can't leave the city to go farm/herb/gank in between queues if they are long. 
---
It gives advantage to premades which already have the inherent advantage of being a premade.
---
😂😂😂
---
The thing is, you're thinking about vanilla lock and their popularity. Yeah, they weren't that popular, they were bad at the beginning at people didn't want to reroll. However they were a secret weapon of vanilla after they got buffed.
---
It's been so many years and expansions since vanilla, and warlock has become a favourite class for many people. They've also been pretty good on retail for many years now always with at least one viable spec, so even more people got into that class. Yeah I know vanilla lock and retail lock are completely different, but so many people will probably roll their retail main.
---
And altough I don't like giving pservers as example, it's pretty obvious locks are way more popular there than they were in the actual vanilla. I think we'll see many locks.
---
I got kicked out of my guild because I took off from raiding for 3 weeks due to vacation in the middle of summer after having full attendance for months. Nice. 😭
---
That picture makes me both happy and irrationally angry.
---
- that Tauren looks good
---
- A BLOOD ELF?!
---
- heh, that guy is panicking because he's feared
---
- LOL ITEMS?!
---
I didn't say that it would have an immediate impact. I said that it existed and was not limited to 60%.
---
I don't know if you remember how outlands was in TBC on a live populated server, but avoiding wpvp is a major plus to time when traveling. Outlands wasn't that big and there were a lot of players in outlands on both factions.
---
Charting and meters were a thing, however Less than 1% of the player base actually raided in vanilla. Even less hardcore.
---
One of reasons retail became so shit is because the game became all about the end game raiding. You need to play with the charts and meters now making it a chore.
---
They are not too fast.  The 1.12 animations have the character sliding because the cycle is not syncing with the movement speed.
---
What happens in Deadmines stays in Deadmines...

Here is another link where you can just click "save as PDF". https://ia800909.us.archive.org/31/items/WoWDungeonCompanion/WowDungeonCompanion.pdf
---
And to think pserver population is just a fraction of the amount of people coming back for it
---
Yes, in my opinion, the top 5 most difficult raid encounters for guilds to overcome are:
---
1. Four Horsemen, the 10th boss in Naxx (technically they could be the 3rd boss, but many guilds saved them for 3rd to last). This was usually the fight that kept guilds from clearing Naxx and there were very few guilds that made it this far (some servers had no guilds make it). You needed a lot of geared tanks and many guilds just stole them from each other.
---
2. C'Thun, the final boss in AQ40. He was literally impossible before a nerf and many guilds were halfway through Naxx when they finally killed him. This is another boss many players never saw.
---
3. Twin Emperors, the 2nd to last encounter in AQ40 (since you can skip the optional ones). This boss stopped many guilds dead cold.
---
4. Vaelastrasz, the 2nd Boss in BWL. This was a strict gear and skill check, known as "the guild killer".
---
5. Razorgore, the 1st Boss in BWL. Molten Core required very little coordination (and this boss required 100% coordination), it was a reality check for most guilds.
---
Other notables:
---
* Chromaggus, the 2nd to last boss in BWL. He had some nasty moves and would easily wipe a raid. Plus, his worst debuff (a periodic stun) could only be dispelled with Hourglass Sand from a few trash mobs in the previous rooms. If you ran out of sand, you had to wait a week.
---
* Gothik the Harvester (the boss before Four Horsemen) in Naxx was chaotic as fuck. He split your raid into two and you just hoped you had enough people alive by the time he came down.
---
* Patchwerk (1st boss of the Construct Quarter in Naxx) was a total gear check for your tank. If you didn't have the gear, it wasn't happening.
---
* Sapphiron and Kel'Thuzad (final 2 bosses of Naxx) were very intense fights that required precision coordination, but generally if you made it past 4H, you could beat these.
---
* Broodlord Lashlayer (3rd boss in BWL). Not a particularly hard boss, but if your group failed, getting back to him meant running the gauntlet all over.
---
* Several of the optional bosses in AQ40 required farming resist sets and weird items like frost damage wands.
---
i've played through multiple pserver launches where they didn't have any dynamic respawning. but yeah, it definitely makes it faster.
---
&gt; you've been proven wrong 
---
Where?
---
These are literally getting better everytime! Haha!
---
This is basically a conspiracy theory
---
Holy shit!
---
I once created a Bloodbath and Beyond guild on Zenedar EU.
---
People complained about the lack of community in WoW and now that Classic is being shown to new audiences through streamers and potential players we have sections of this community complaining? This is some low tier gatekeeping and it's embarrassing. We should want more people, so it's successful, it lasts longer and you get to cotinue enjoying Classic. Let's show all newcomers what it's about and start fostering a positive community outlook,don't turn people away because they haven't met your stringent criteria.
---
Free enchants @ sw fountain (tips appreciated) have about 20 more, just open trade!
---
really enjoyed this
---
Can we start just deleting all beta access whine posts? It’s actually sad and makes the greater population look bad
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all
---
The TCG rewards are TBC so it’s a bit early to start worrying about that. 
---
Personally I hope you can enter you’re codes like back in the day. If it’s tied to your account I’m screwed cos I’m in a different region than I was back then.
---
Carefully.
---
Or lvl in another races zones for rep for cooler lvl 60 mount?
---
I swear at this point it has to be trolling with all these posts
---
Yeah uhm it Shows no results, already looked for it.
---
At aug 26. starts my annually 3 weeks military repetition course ... This goin to be a very painful time.
---
You're not entirely wrong about the losing combo points thing, it's been discussed at great length but Blizzard hasn't said anything.
---
However:
---
&gt; you can casually kick the healer next to you and open with cheapshot on one person
---
Kick will pull you out of stealth, making cheapshot impossible.
---
Honestly my brother used to duel 60 mages on his 42 gnome mage outside Ironforge. Mind you, he lost alot but he won a few too. Even a 30-40 character can do 300-500 damage fairly quickly.
---
Its not the one hes talking about.
---
The game is thriving. What even is this comment.
---
Some Fem Troll goon made a hilarious PvP video parody back in 05/06 (goons were on Dark Iron IIRC).  I would have no idea how to find it these days, but I highly recommend it.
---
It supports it. 
---
I'm on 3440x1440 monitor too, AW3418DW
---
Yes, works perfect on my 1440p ultrawide.
---
His response was very vague and out of place, the OP didn't even mention weapons and he randomly says you can't wear ranged weapons with melee at the same time...Obviously I assumed he was saying that Hunters in classic sucked or something.
---
It's almost like they would be raising the level cap in beta like they have already done in the alpha
---
well hot damn
---
it depends how easy it is to manipulate layers 
---
if i can spawn nodes essentially by jumping layers ill abuse the shit out of that phase 1 
---
if its hard to abuse ill just avoid mining/herbing and related professions
---
skinning / letherwork will obviously be fine and is rather simple to level so i may level that wait a couple months then dump it for mining engineering on my main.
---
after i get engineering up on my main ill ditch mining and prob level enchanting or something thst does not need a gathering profession

Vanilla, I started in 2006.
---
literally yes
---
[proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Fd7flRJLs)
---
How in the world would they get to keep their names when the server is wiped?
---
I like the idea of really fleshing it out.
---
we will see
---
i highly doubt there will be any level 60 testing
---
Uhh... the original stealth animation is the second one sweety.
---
&gt; sort of getting it to the pinnacle of what it could have been had they not rushed to finish it off in favor of the next expansion
---
Vanilla *is* finished. 1-60 would need to be redesigned so that the missing content doesn't completely destroy the flow and pacing and power balance of 1-60.
---
I’m not opposed to options but realistically if they added an option for something like this every time it came up there’d be 100 different options for this.  Also I’m not personally concerned with this particular change but I think  when something like this is brought up it should be “how was it in actual vanilla” rather than “some people might like the newer version more”.
---
Yeah people will get bored when there isn't even raid logging left to do.
---
Well played
---
I remember sleblond saying some crazy roleplay shit on the forums about the light and paladins. I played holkan on horde in BoV.
---
That is an ass ton of screen shots. Glad to see so many azgalor names.
---
nice troll attempt
---
What do you mean "shows no results"?
---
Every Monday there's a stickied thread for finding a guild. That's your best chance of success.
---
You yes
---
It is also among the best specs for open world content into Tier 2, where pets are not in danger of dying with full uptime. (ala raids)
---
Blizzard could allow them to reserve names prior to August 13th, do you think we'll actually log in and create characters on August 13th? 
---
We'll most likely just go to a link and reserve names.
---
Which they could and most likely will give beta testers first dibs.
---
I've been streaming the beta on ultrawide, it looks great and has no problems.
---
My friend group recently started playing DnD (first timers for all but the DM) and tbh this is contributing to my desire for classic.
---
Oh man! This is &lt;Impulse&gt; on Daggerspine-US. I got to raid with some of these dudes, but haven't seen most of these names in years. What a throwback!
---
Nope. They sure won’t.
---
Ah okay so it just gezs deleted?
---
I thought it would Show up longer my bad!
---
&gt;Druids can easily hold AB points on their own vs multiple horde long enough for the team to arrive.  They are far more than just flag carriers
---
Holding a flag and guarding a flag wouldn't really be classed as "far more than just flag carriers" :p
---
Feel better now?  Despite me agreeing with what you said, you pretty much jumped to the conclusion I was apart of the train, when I was just pointing out their perspective.   The other person in this thread picked up the same vibes I did.   Does it feel good being above everybody?
---
That makes absolutely no sense. Why in the world would beta testers get earlier access to that?
---
no
---
Thanks a lot. So 34 inch it is then. :-)
---
What GPU would you recommend to have stable 100+fps? CPU is gonna be something like i9-9900k or one of the new Ryzen 3000.
---
Im only playing classic for the next 2 years so i dont want an overkill GPU while the CPU is not meant to be changed within the next 4 years
---
Nope. There will not be any balance changes. What you see is what you get.
---
Warlocks are fine. They'll compete with mages if there's a Shadow Priest in the raid. Not as bad as Hunters (but they don't have anything requiring them in raids like Hunters do).
---
Great streamer, not a great player :p
---
But why not just use a different weapon ench like flametounge for the trash? And then back to windfury on the boss?
---
Because blizzard can do what they want.
---
They will give their employees that opportunity and most likely beta testers.
---
Do you really think they won't let soda, asmon, esfand, staysage, venruki not get the names they want?
---
Missing it entirely because of work overseas. Feelsbadman.
---
I feel like you're misremembering. I've heard accounts from other people who say they absolutely melted through low level dungeons in vanilla, especially mages who could AoE everything down. I've tried soloing on private servers with a shit geared 60 druid, yes even 30 elites hit pretty hard. But now we know that private server elites actually do 2x the damage elites did in actual vanilla.
---
I honestly don't see how you could have trouble in Stockade in Naxx gear.
---
Deleted? No. That link I posted is a list of all the LFG threads from every week. [This is last week's](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqtcvo/looking_for_group_monday_may_20_2019/). You can still browse it.
---
I feel like OP meant to post this in the main WoW sub not here
---
That title makes it sound like the gryphons are finally fed up with carrying nerds across the world after 15 years.
---
He is saying no, but you know that 👍
---
I hoped it'd imply you open on mage for example forching him to blink or get dmg and u being able to kick the other caster next to him
---
The blind stuff on BG is big issue too.
---
Warriorrrrrrrrrr
---
its a good competitor to hunter.
---
I think people would even enjoy just content for a challenge or fun
---
say for example they put in Karazhan 100% same as it is in tbc so meant for level 70's.
---
Now i'm not sure how many 60s you would need to beat it but it would be a nice challenge and you could get a sweet mount everything else it just about useless
---
Wouldn't it be quicker to kill the mob faster and drink?
---
I've never played FF, so I can't really answer those questions, but you should look into [loot lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/). They're fast, efficient, public, and everyone knows what happens to the gear when it drops.
---
But if i cluck on your First link it says " wow, such emtpy" thats why I was wondering.
---
This link works, thanks!
---
I realised I shouldn't have used the word 'prove' and instead 'suggest'.
---
my 980 played ultrawide stress test fine 
---
didnt check actual fps
---
980 is old as fuck though so ill prob upgrade before launch
---
I mean you'll be able to spam mindflay and fear every now and again :)
---
1v1 both are great, premades would take a rogue first.
---
I believe that people that started during Cataclysm and anything after shouldn't be able to test Classic WoW because they know nothing about it.
---
I've been using a 1080ti with a Ryzen 2700x on a 3440x1440p ultrawide. Locked at 100 fps on ultra settings. Haven't checked if it could go any higher.
---
Hmm, not sure why. Look in the sidebar of this sub, under "Weekly Threads", and you'll see "Looking for Group Monday". Does that link work?
---
Posting Pservers names gets the post deleted but I do know of one that sounds like the phrase  “fLightBringer”
---
I got respect for the people playing classic I already know its nothing for me
---
Had a buddy back in vanilla he was a healer, he always kept first aid and alchemy maxed. If he went oom he would start using bandages and would always distribute potions
---
I've played DPS on private servers, and its actually like beyond easy to find a group. Just do /who paladin 20-25 and start messaging people. 
---
I can throw a group together in like 2 minutes as a DPS. No problem
---
The little payo ofc
---
Problem with releasing high level raids is the power creep. 
---
I would like to see some lower level dungeons and interesting long quest chains released.
---
All classes are already viable in Classic so no need for a balance change.
---
Horde dominated like 48:52?
---
Lol, K3 alliance tales to explain why they suck at PvP :D

---
Yeah, like that guy from forums that said that "classic gameplay is mediocre", people have different opinions, but sadly r/classicwow is very toxic and thinks that their opinion are superior.
---
Nope. Ion already said they would be not interfering with actions such as streamsniping, ninja looting, guild drama, etc..  
---
Nothing is gonna happen to anyone who choose to do so.
---
Mfw you grasp the concept of another re release after this one
---
Yes it is lol
---
You realise OSRS was dieing and haemorrhaging players until they started adding new content etc right?
---
https://i.vgy.me/NfknW4.png
---
Like, it's not even a discussion to be made.
---
The 'only benefit' has been that the game isn't dead and is now thriving.
---
the only time they'll disappear is if you use them or delete them.
---
i do have beta access. they aren't a conjured item.
---
No, there's only one "Beta and Stress Test: WoW Classic" option. The Stress Test and Beta are just split into realms but the clients are exactly the same. If you only have access to the Stress Test but the realm isn't up then you just get the error message in OP.
---
Fuck yes. The rpg element. More exploration, mysteries and lore.
---
so a loot list is like a dkp system but for every item?
---
do people just add their name next to every item they want and go in the queue for it?
---
Ah okay, I thought there was less identity because of the fact you just invest point in a skill tree and there no clear spec like it is now. Since they replace almost all skills based on the spec you chose on retail, I came into this conclusion. Thanks for your point then, I'm even more thrilled to play classic!
---
Yeah thanks for 3 year old news.
---
Indeed it does! I recently ordered myself an ultrawide monitor and am looking forward to it. Here is some footage of the wow classic beta running on this 21:9 ratio! https://youtu.be/EdXXJfVy-1s
---
The reason I don’t want TBC is flying. It changed things sooooooo much. Seems like many people started playing in TBC or WOTLK and don’t even know a world without flying. 
---
Go classic and add some expansion or content related to Mount Hyjal and the other content that was planned but never released in those days.
---
Some likes to contribute and leech a bit sometimes at the "right times" though =)
---
The development cost of new content is just too high compared to having TBC that has ALOT of good content already. Blizzard always does what is "safe" and it's much safer to do TBC than extra vanilla content.
---
So with loot lists, it seems that everyone who does their research on what loot they want gets a fair shake at the loot. That sounds like a good foundational system. 
---
How does this system account for priority toward critical roles like main tank?
---
The ground work has been done for classic and they know what needs to be done from now on so it will be much easier and faster to re-release older expansions  
---
We are talking about releasing old expansions vs making new stuff
---
Didn't play this xpac, I HAVE TO BE THERE
---
&gt;Don't try to tell me getting rank 14 requires the same skill as getting gladiator. 
---
No one said that. You claimed that getting rank 14 requires zero skill at all, which is a lie.
---
&gt;At least half of the player base has the skill to get Rank 14 should they put in the hours
---
But that's again false, because only one person per week can become rank 14. This means that you need to be have more kills than anyone else on the server.
---
I'm definitely not misremembering. The only class thats going to have an easy time are Mages in open areas where you have plenty of room to kite through Blizzard.
---
Note that lvl \~35 elites have around 4k HP, that's a lot to whittle down. In MC gear outside of a raid environment you will probably have like 300-500 DPS depending on your class. It's not as easy as you think. It's not impossible obviously, but it's going to be much slower than simply getting a group together.
---
1784, no invite.
---
Thats not true at all. Yesterday I flew from Rachet to Ashenvale and it took like 15min because it flew through Mulgore to Auberdine and then to Ashenvale.
---
My top 3 pets to try and tame as a young buck hunter.
---
White Lion as pictured
---
Black Lion (Humar) North of Ratchet
---
And finally White Bear (Bjarn) in Dun Morough
---
That page I link explains it in detail, but here are the main points:
---
* Every player develops a spreadsheet of the items they want in ranked order. These lists are made before raiding and cannot be changed.
---
* When an item drops, the person with the highest ranking value gets it. Plain and simple.
---
* If an item on your list drops and you don't get it, your ranking for that item goes up slightly. Overall attendance also increases your item ranking values.
---
* If an item on your list is tied with someone else, you both /roll. The loser gets a moderate boost to that item ranking value.
---
* Some items can only be ranked by certain classes.
---
* There are restrictions on what items can be ranked where, the page I linked goes into great detail on this.
---
Actually I play on ascension. And I enjoy it a lot (was actually trying to find a WOTLK server that's half decent too but have yet to be successful).
---
I never said it was a bad thing to play on private servers. I said that just because you play on a private server... neither entitles you to beta access nor probably looks good in blizzards eyes.
---
I joined a guild called ‘No Beta Access’.
---
It has had over 600 people join since last week I believe.
---
For some reason I recently decided to start leveling my Mage bank alt. Definitely noticed the competition for quest mobs, etc.
---
Dude the beta only goes up to level 30 and you didn't even show the loot wtf obviously a private server
---
Can't wait!
---
The que believe it or not is also part of the charm for me. if it takes 15 minutes i have the time to clean up or w/e.
---
&gt; Or would you argue that introducing any flying on any continent would then make a few ground travel on other continents as feeling less rewarding or being more of an arduous task oh, because we know there are other places we could just fly?
---
Kind of a moot point considering Azeroth became largely obsolete in TBC, so traveling there was objectively unrewarding.
---
You're truly in denial about OSRS considering how many times I've seen you spout off against it.
---
Holy shit I forgot it had 2 moons you're right.
---
I support this message.
---
*at least they didn't implement the god-awful post-vanilla mark*
---
Not to mention his PVM vs PVP example is LITERALLY a Reddit meme and only a very small minority actually hates one or the other.
---
What classes it as "finished" there was plenty of content in the game files that was planned for vanilla, plenty more that never made it. 
---
Adding an lv30 instance for example wouldn't effect the game at all. Just make another play through a little more interesting.
---
You and /u/JiffyTube should fight it out and whoever is more persuasive, I'll join. lol
---
For real though, I'm really not sure what I want to do. I'm not really a PvP guy, so I def want to maximize my chances in PvE. That was my original though process when going with Alliance as Lock initially. Less Locks = Higher chances to get into a raid probably, right?
---
Remember trying to tame Dishu for the first time and having a heart attack as I am swarmed by her cubs. Needless to say I did not make it.
---
Please use capitalisation properly. Looks sloppy.
---
I would rather have gradual power creep as opposed to a complete reset with power creep still being a thing with TBC.
---
I don't get it. Why are people complaining on reddit about these things instead of bug reporting or posting on the official forums where the devs are actually reading?
---
Stam &gt; int &gt; str, agi, spi.  Stam lets you live longer, corpse runs cost you time.  Extra 10 str will not be enough dmg to kill a mob faster (you will autoattack the same amount of times) but 10int will give you an extra heal.
---
I mean, no one wants to fight SL lock in WPvP let's be honest.
---
If not big /s then thank fuck for not having to play with those fucks
---
-37, sit down
---
Don't message me anymore please.
---
No. SW had a shitty connection. From IF the Harbour is just around the corner and most of the high level content was fast to rech from there. Only things SW had and IF didn't where Onyxia buff(wasn't important on retail), the pvp quarter master and a moonwell.
---
&gt; Adding an lv30 instance for example wouldn't effect the game at all.
---
The only item where tanks get absolute priority is Thunderfury. They also share priority for Maladath with Rogues over all Fury Warriors. Other than that, they're in the same boat as everyone else. However, it's safe to assume that non-tanks won't have tank items very high on their ranking list.
---
I don't even follow this guy, why everyone is so angry with him?
---
You can test for the layers or just ask people in your guild to randomly inv you, out of 10 people that logged in at different times there is bound to be someone that is on a different layer.
---
You just need to find a few people that you can confirm are on a different layer and from then it's easy.
---
You log in, ask some people to inv you, when you see that you changed layers you found a person that was on a different layer.
---
Streamers have already shown that it's not just possible, but in fact really easy to abuse.
---
didnt fail, but ill sure as hell do it again.
---
I mean to be fair, Esfand plays ret paladin. Class is mostly about class/matchup knowledge and barely about mechanics.
---
Hahahaha
---
This guy sounds like he hasn’t played a second of vanilla wow, I wouldn’t take his opinion seriously. 
---
I would suggest trying both classic &amp; retail though, I personally enjoy classic more but each to their own
---
Burning crusade was my turning point. I remember flying mounts and getting hella mad, I hate changes and they changed everything. Altough TBC is a good expansion I loved vanilla way to much
---
What exactly is screwed up?
---
cash me ousside jow bout dat
---
Possible, it's a near given fact that they'll do up to 50 considering the alpha players are up to at least a lv48 cap which likely means they're on a 50 cap instead. Would be weird for them not to test at least lbrs ubrs Strat and scholo with a slightly higher cap
---
If you notice the spells I show at the beginning he has a life drain, fear and curse. I can't risk having any of these cast on me or I could potentially lose the fight. I need to limit his opportunities for life draining solely to when FD/trap resists so that i'll be able to counter it with scatter or war stomp as I did in the video. His life drain will literally heal him to full hp if not stopped.
---
They are god tier with all cds up, but the cds are long.  Cold blood is 3 minutes, evasion, sprint, and vanish are each 5, and prep is 10.  This makes them strong in wpvp and dueling but in organized pvp, apart from niche roles like flag defense, they're not the best.
---
Streamers get in because:
---
 1. There can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of eyes on the beta and those people can all bring bugs to Blizzard's attention.
---
 4. Of course hype. 
---
She has over a million followers.
---
Yeah that works too, thanks!
---
This and those " iM gLaD i KePt mY VaNilLa GuIdEs" are pure cancer.
---
Mate, youn't even touch that crap.
---
You'll just use your current account and download that crap on the launcher as will the rest of us. Jesus.
---
Was getting the inflated gold rewards before character hit 5 though. If remains as such outside the stress test could prove very broken for the economy
---
This is obvious satire, but it would be believable with the "grrr" which is so stupid.
---
My reaction was "ooo heroic strike feels heroic and I smack ass when I get that nice green staff from hogger quest." Level 5  party killing hogger is fun
---
Correct.
---
So can we make like a petition and sign it so that the classic dev team can be informed? :)
---
Nothing is screwed up I assume private servers just had the wrong values. I don't know what the value difference is just heard it's different. Just curious how different l. As a human on private servers I could get exalted well before 40 with darnasus. Curious how different it will be for classic
---
Scaring them is fun, too. From the low level's perspective, it feels like you have been shown mercy.
---
This post is satire. 
---
Kripparian (he) was one of the most hardcore raiders of all time.
---
I'm pretty sure it's someone poking fun at people complaining, but she isn't a he (iirc the image is a barb from Diablo). Kripp = the past hardcore Diablo player, and he used to play wow a bunch before with hardcore guilds.
---
Yeah haha, just having fun mate. I add the grrr at the end to make it obvious
---
Oh look, a bunch of crap that you won't use.
---
Probably got sharded accidentantly to their classic realm so they grabbed him to one-shot Ragnaros.
---
That’s why the playerbase isn’t even close to what it once was when they targeted ”hardcores” instead of ”casuals”(in your own words). 
---
If anything they’re making big bucks from tricking people with pay2win mechanics &amp; shops, fun game you got there bud. Real casual friendly, Whip out your wallet &amp; enjoy that single player experience!
---
Kinda pointless, we should just find a point of entry, someone to report that to, but I don't know about that
---
Yes but for these devs you have to factor in the cost of classic which is still a lot and would be a lot more without the work that went in for free. They also don't sell classic/tbc anymore so the only potential revenue is subscription compared to selling a new expansion, so yes it is "slightly less expensive" but the revenue is also much lower to it equates.
---
This is just a preemptive reply to anyone that doesn't get the joke - Krip is an old school top-parsing player that started his Youtube career in mid-Wrath.
---
Spriests are one of the strongest 1v1ers in the game, if not the strongest 
---
. Rogues and locks are similarly good in 1v1 though.
---
1. Shotcalling in vanilla is pretty easy as there isnt alot of mechanics per boss, but raiding with 40 people require heavy organising, that where your challenge will be (assignments, positioning, task orders and such)
---
2. I always used zero-sum dkp, there are alot of easier things to use now though, perhaps even some addon to help with loot distribution.
---
3. Just make sure you have enough people to fill the 40 spots, kick those with poor attendance and toxic people. Skill isnt the most important thing in the beginning of progression.
---
4. It translates some, spatial awareness, positioning and reaction time is all things that is equal in most mmos. 
---
5. I would start my own if you have alot of people (10-15+, finding a guild with many open raidspots is though, especially when rules and raid times have to match.
---
Yes, you're ironically right. The *only* benefit has been that it didn't die. Thriving because of the voting system? Unlikely.
---
On a recent stream they’ve said less than 25% of members are voting, plus *Integrity Updates* completely bypass the voting system entirely:

---
&gt;No one said that. You claimed that getting rank 14 requires zero skill at all, which is a lie.
---
Define skill. Is getting top 1% of a ranked ladder in a game skill, or being able to dress yourself in the morning? I think doing what half the playerbase is capable of doing is not skillful.
---
&gt;But that's again false, because only one person per week can become rank 14. This means that you need to be have more kills than anyone else on the server.
---
Again, no. Just because one/two people a week can get rank 14 means nothing. The people who grind the most honor get the title. Not the most skilled player.
---
Coming back to this. Blizzard has added auto-loot into Classic. You no longer need to hold shift.
---
Yeah, he's an iconic WoW player. Completely deserves  Beta invite even though I think any one is deserving to play a game regardless of knowledge or status OR time played.
---
this guy, I did not meant to sell nothing here, so thank you
---
hmm it seems like the system does not reward attendance all that much so people who take a while off are not punished much. i dont want a lot of spare people who want to raid sitting out so id need to punish people who no show
---
sitting out always made people salty
---
also alts get 90% of the same points i could see an alt getting anything over a main being a pretty big issue.
---
it seems fairly complex because there are quite a number of spreadsheets
---
if some addon could handle it for the entire guild maybe but it seems fairly manual?
---
I started uni in 05, dropped out in 06 (here our uni year is calender year based) since I failed every unit due to a huge wow addiction. Wouldn't recommend.... am going to play the shit out of classic.
---
Less than 25% of players vote, lol. Nobody has any ground to stand on to say that OSRS was *saved* by implementing the voting system.
---
Can this thread help me decide between playing *Male Dwarf Priest* and *Female Dwarf Priest*?!
---
i really dont think it will go past 40 max
---
It’s just a formula though from what I understand. If you want to reward players for attendance, adjust it accordingly. Same goes for Alts.
---
Truly, truly in denial. I'm better off just blocking you so have fun.
---
Meh I personally enjoyed flying in TBC.  That being said I also stopped playing WoW completely shortly before WotLK so my perspective is probably a bit different.  Obviously a large portion of at least this sub is anti-flying though.
---
People got exalted as nonhuman too. Not a bug, same will be in classic too.
---
&gt;No, the reason why the game became so shit was because of the implementation of flying mounts and the automation of the game which meant that the whole aspect of the MMORPG process and community engagement were de facto non-existent. To blame dps meters on that is as wrong as it could be. Did you witness N0stalrius, E1ysium and Kr0nos I and III? Everyone and their mom use meters on those servers while optimizing as much as possible and guess what: it made next to no difference on the MMORPG experience.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;About your last point. The retail became shit because raiding was the only thing the game had to offer. Raiding in vanilla was one of MANY things to spend your time on. And that is an essential point to remember.
---
To each their own I guess. It'd be bizarre for them to spend that long on only 1 to 40, when alpha went past it
---
im so happy kripp gets the beta and can stop playing cardstone for a living
---
Damn, triggered by statistics the devs revealed recently. Stay fragile, my friend.
---
just check once a week now they done inviting people
---
or start streaming retail thats prob a faster way in
---
Pom pyro says hi
---
Weird, wonder what happened then cause I don't think Ive seen people on beta have messed up values
---
Oh ok sorry didnt know lol. Too many people complaining as of late I am pretty much just reposting this comment every time I see a streamer complaint thread
---
People have stated that several Quests in the classic beta are giving half the rep they do on private servers
---
All classes are viable. Warlock, especially in alliance, is big in demand. You will find a guild to raid with in no time.
---
do not reply to low effort troll threads
---
It's a good satire because it could be true.
---
Lol most gamers ? 99% of people that game dont spend 8 hours a day playing. Nonsence
---
Ah okay didnt know. Thank you.
---
I had to buy a second copy of the game cause one of my installation cds had a crack in it and when I went to re-instal the game sometime 2006 the installation disc just shattered in my pc.
---
Times were so much more simple when being young and oblivious...
---
yeah id prob just have an alt run
---
if mains dont want anything much from a raid like mc but we still run it for bindings and to gear new players id prob just let new players bid for it and everyone else could just roll
---
What's the backend look like? It wouldn't be hard to make perfect, this is the shortest path problem between two nodes in an undirected graph.
---
&gt; when you queue for BG’s at the Battlemaster in the city, it teleports you back to them once the BG is done.
---
this is correct.
---
What's stopping you from being a happy lad
---
Don't see why you need to incentivize people to play an instance or quest chain. I actually think that's half the problem in retail. 
---
Plenty of instances just weren't "worth" running in Vanilla such as SFK for alliance, Gnomeregan, Uldaman or Blackfathom Depths. Yet I never had issues finding groups for them.
---
Is WoW a CPU intensive game? I'm on a 2070 with a 4770K and 3440x1440 and I get 60 fps avg with heavy drops to 30 in say Wintergrasp
---
 The books are fantastic quality and it's still my preferred choice to have a guide of this sort open  as I play, even with two screens.
---
Plenty of nasty directed at retail players. Don’t put us on a pedestal there are wankers on both games.
---
Hi, /u/Theoxdel
---
Can they detect how many end-users have downloaded/installed the client and make an educated guess based on location? Eg if 10000 people from Australia have downloaded the client you’d probably be safe with 1 pvp and 1 pve server. 
---
Allows for higher pop initially on layers to cotract sadly into single layer servers.
---
If it’s possible to detect that, then it’s simple math to calculate server distribution
---
I like the video but that's not his own song.
---
6% of the voters are absolutely terrible people IRL and will be KOS in game.
---
You guys asked for vanilla, this is vanilla.
---
1. Attendance isn't as important to &lt;Onslaught&gt; because they only have 1-2 raid nights per week. MC gets done in under 30 minutes, Ony gets killed in 20, and BWL gets cleared in under an hour. And we're not talking about AQ/Naxx gear here. They killed Vael in 16 seconds with MC/Ony gear only.
---
2. The punishment for a no-show is there, it's just subtle. If the item drops, they obviously don't get it. But if a player with the same ranking value for an item is there even when it doesn't drop and the other is not, that difference will usually be enough to put the player with better attendance above them.
---
3. 90% is a big difference in this system. It means a main can have up to 10 items on their list that an alt can't beat them at, regardless of their own rankings.
---
4. All the spreadsheets have the same format. You follow a template. That template feeds into an automated guild template which just has to be referenced. The only thing that gets updated is attendance (and they only count attendance for those that are present from start to finish).
---
&gt; Yet I never had issues finding groups for them.
---
That's... I don't trust your memory, tbh. Even on packed, pop-cap inflated p-servers, there was almost nobody running Gnomeregan, even less SFK.
---
You apparently got really lucky, but finding groups for those dungeons regularly is not normal because nobody runs those if they don't have to.
---
If you don't follow him, why did you post this?
---
Its an undead using orb of deception... clearly...
---
You are oddly specific in your numbers for someone who hasn’t played vanilla in over 10 years. I think you’re exaggerating. Yeah caster mobs did a lot of damage, but they also died fast.
---
I’m watching streamers blitz through dungeons at lvl 30 in WoW Classic beta. There’s no way a lvl 60 in Naxx gear is gonna have a hard time with them.
---
Yep.  That first encounter with a ret pally hitting you for 3.5k changes a lot of people.
---
Yes, all the original 60 dungeons were 10 man's with UBRS/LBRS being 15 mans
---
Same for me :) I won't mind a queue. Just wonder which solution they will use if this becomes a thing.
---
Why are you linking a dictionary that shows that the guy above you is using the word correctly?
---
Most things crafted via professions can be traded or sold in vanilla, there are no such things as the ring enchants or epic gems aretailoring only spellthread. That being said though, engineering items are normally restricted to engineers. Nothing that gives much of a boost in pve, but in pvp engineering is huge.
---
People in your guild have a priority to be in the same layer, you're going to be whispering randoms to invite you, most won't and by the time you find someone on another layer and transfer there's no guarantee that the nodes you're farming haven't already been taken.
---
It's not going to be more efficient than playing normally.
---
So you never cast shadowbolt in this spec? Why not get improved shadowbolt?
---
You finally went oom, huh?
---
No. Nothing like that. There are few bind of pickup craftable items though.
---
Agreed
---
Yes, I did kinda misread your comment. Well Mark Kern (If I remember than name correctly) said "respawns increased rapidly", so I am not sure about it now. Lets hope they address this.
---
Yeah, of course. My thoughts were more along where there would be 10k people trying to at peak hours, with 3k capacity for single-layer  servers, that would leave 7k login queues.
---
Ah another one of these posts.
---
Yeah it's Bon Jovi. Who's awesome. Just like the video :p
---
Yes, as long as you use [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall)
---
It's only game. Why we gotta fight?
---
&gt; regardless of what the rates are compared to private servers - there will be 100x more competition
---
why would you think there would be more competition on servers with a lower total population that also aren't international? this isn't even taking the layering into consideration
---
Yes and UBRS 15
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think all dungeons could be raided early on, and I dont think there was a cap on how many, so potentially a 40 man raid. This was because originally all raids (MC, BWL, Naxx) were planned to be inside dungeons so you would have to bring your 40 man raid all the way through BRD to do MC.
---
Bc of this, Im gonna try it. Thanks
---
What's the most?
---
The tanking guides say engineering is a must due to some aoe items. If everything can be bought I guess it doesn’t matter what my second is
---
True. I was wondering about a hypothetical scenario where 50-70% of retail players joined Classic permanently, leaving fewer retail players to spend money in microtransactions.
---
Enhancment shaman in classic was always my favorite(because thrall duh) I played one on retail vanilla and made a few on the private sector...
---
I cant say I'm going to return to the class this time around simply because the gear competition is just ridiculous.Even while leveling, you will be competing against hunters and warriors for rolls constantly.
---
Just got real tired of being at the bottom of priority list for all items ide want.
---
i never healed classic, but as Enhancement I could pretty much 1shot a lot of things with good Windfury procs, and could survive well enough with shocks and totems when my stick wouldn't whack.
---
Not really, he got heal and used bubble
---
The only gamebreaking imbalance that was kinda rough was tanking. Just warriors, and maybe a really decked out druid. Can't say about paladins since I played Horde.
---
I too think this is the most likely scenario.
---
Imagine making a whole spreadsheet just to make another one of these.
---
I really think they invited too few people to the beta. Not just being salty, there's just clearly room for way more beta testers without even having to open any more servers. They could *easily* double the invites. Almost nobody got in. For all intents and purposes, this beta has been a premium server that only select people and their friends get to play on. It's basically an invite-only MMO.
---
When they expect an active subscription just for a *chance* to get in (which turned out to be laughably small if your name isn't on some kind of list), they frankly have an obligation to invite more than the absolute bare minimum. If they wanted the absolute bare minimum, it's not okay to require a subscription to opt in without providing any such information. It was misleading.
---
Is there even a thousand beta testers online at any given time? Let's be real, there's no issue of cost or anything; it's not like Blizzard would have to buy more server space in order to accomodate another thousand testers or whatever. They could probably invite ten times more than they have without any extra trouble or expense. Hell, even start inviting "guests" who can play but not report bugs, just in case volume of reports is a concern.
---
The beta right now is a unique chapter WoW. It's WoW with a level cap of 30. It has its own meta, its own epic experiences, something that has never before and will never again be possible. It's popular for the very same reason that spin-off shows get made: fans of something want to try a different but related aspect of it. It elevated the viewership of WoW from low to one of the highest on Twitch. It's *clearly* more than just testing bugs. It's a unique, exclusive version of the game that almost nobody gets to play. Ever.
---
The testing aspect is whatever, it's something that happens automatically and there's no reason to expect that everyone must approach a beta like some kind of scientist nurturing his life's work. People aren't grumpy because they don't get to send in bug reports, they're grumpy because they're missing out on what looks to be an exciting and memorable version of the game that they'll never have the chance to play.
---
It's quite obvious that Blizzard could invite many more players. There's not even enough players between the two beta realms to really overpopulate a single server. It may be all that Blizzard technically need, but given how they expect an active subscription just for a chance to get invited, I think they should have invited more than a tiny fraction of the community. It's incredibly shady to offer something to an entire community, essentially charge money for it, and then give nothing to 99.9% of those who did.
---
UBRS was a 15 man but LBRS was (and is) a 10-man. Most people don't know this, but nearly all the dungeons can still fit 10 players, you just can't complete quests.
---
The only dungeons that are strictly 5-man are BRD, Dire Maul, Stratholme, and Scholomance.
---
[Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418)
---
jesus, just no
---
shadow priest has to be the single aspect of vanilla people are most clueless about
---
What about in phase 2 with world bosses, where they promised layering would be turned off?
---
I hope you're right
---
This is an instance where screenshots are far more valuable than video. No one can read that shit.
---
Imagine having to go through all the trouble of making a YouTube video and calling someone a virgin to try and look cool to people on the internet.?
---
When did they switch them to 5m dungeons? My first strat run I was level 56 and it was for sure 10m. I joined my 3 year guild on that run. Good times. Thanks for the spontaneous memory.
---
The 1.8%ish overall DPS increase isn’t worth having your personal character that you’re going to cherish be a race that you didnt want them to be. If you really wanted to be a dwarf or a nelf but you felt forced to be human because of a +5 weapon skill racial that you may not even benefit from because you went daggers, that’s a bigger loss than any decrease on the meters.
---
Same deal with people playin dwarf priests, I’d quit the fuckin game if i rolled a priest and had to be a dwarf instead of a human or a nelf.
---
I used to run a twink guild back in TBC and i found out that my guildbank was worth 100 of millions of gold in unobtainable items. I also realized that most of my hundreds of low level alts wear the old starting zone shirts such as Thug shirt which are all worth a million gold each now. 
---
What I'm trying to say is that if you did play back in vanilla/TBC you probably have these old items/recipes/patterns lying around that are worth months of "free" game time.
---
IMO, post-TBC content is the best move. Keeping it as short as possible, I feel as though TBC is a more natural extension of Vanilla whereas WotLK is when the game started to become more modern, the rough edges were smoothed out more with core system changes and the zones and gear looked significantly better than they did in the past 2 expansions. I think TBC fits right in with Classic in terms of visual and gameplay design and so using that as a jumping off point for adding new content is the best move. Things like Flying Mounts did kill a bunch of social interactions, but they can be kept to just an Outland thing as opposed to "Outland but kinda Azeroth". TBC also gives plenty of time for content to be thought out, revised and added without feeling rushed to get something out the door, which helps with not killing the game as a whole.  
---
Also, I think new content should only be added if they are open with their community about their design philosophy and the decisions they are making while taking feedback into account. Announcing things and then going through with them without any community input is a surefire way to kill the game.

I reactivated 5 accounts, bringing my total number of active subscriptions up to 20, just to increase my chance of getting an invite.
---
I'd pay a lot of money (battlenet balance) to get beta access.
---
Trying to look cool? What because i post a video oh god kids...
---
ok so say someone joins and they dont list any mc gear just gear from raids after that?
---
i think thats how id try and manipulate it
---
you should then be in the lead for every item you want by after mc comes out. you can actually do similar with dkp obviously
---
i dont really see how fast a raid gets cleared changes stuff
---
if people no show you need standby's waiting to fill spots , those people are never happy and being on the bench caused a lot of salt in vanilla.
---
also do the sat players get points?
---
if you can find people to sit out and stick around then yeah no show's are not a big deal
---
Proscriptivists still do not seem to have realised that dictionaries are almost exclusively descriptivist institutions.
---
You'll have to effectively double the amount of Paladin votes since they are only playable on one faction (assuming a 50-50 faction split), to get a correct number of Paladins in relation to other classes. They aren't as low on the list as it looks.

You’re calling someone else a kid when you called your video virgin raging.
---
Was fairly certain BRD is an exception, and that you can go through it in a raid group to enter Molten Core. 
---
Atleast I know that was the original intention for how to get to 40 man raids, same as the BWL-entrance in UBRS. 
---
But I'm probably wrong as the memory is fuzzy. I remember being a full raid in a lot of dungeons in the past - for fun - but know that got changed during vanilla in some patch..
---
I've run census over last 3 days during both EU and US peak times and rogue is the most popular class amongst 1700 unique characters seen on horde side.

List in spreadsheet format for readability so it doesn't look so long. "Whole spreadsheet" kinda implies it took any more effort than just writing it, which it didn't.
---
Which dungeons are worth doing while levelling?
---
The rake?
---
Doesn't this suggest that shaman are going to be like the most/second most played? I remember in vanilla they were on the rarer end of classes. 
---
As someone on the more casual end who still wants to raid when I get the chance, is shaman going to be a bad pick due to the number of them around in a raid? A lot of competition for gear that will (rightfully) go to the more dedicated shamans?

To the people claiming it's fake: it is clear people in the picture are abusing the layering system and letting their 120 blood elf friend carry them through MC for powerleveling
---
Judging from [Ion's tweet](https://twitter.com/watcherdev/status/1121853269033328641), Eye of Sulfuras should start dropping in phase 2, and Bindings of the Windseeker in phase 3.
---
Awesome thanks for the heads up. I’m leveling right now but I’ll re-spec when I get that deep
---
Really? Aw...
---
Do the other pets have their voicelines at least? Like the "void if prohibited" pun for the Voidwalker?
---
i would guess 99 pct bindings wont drop in phase 1 as originally they were added with BWL patch
---
What class are you playing? If you’re going to play melee, I would recommend Horde. Windfury as a rogue/warrior is really fun in 5 mans/pvp/raids.
---
Ah yes I have seen this one in a guide
---
Okey, thanks
---
Might wanna look at some forum posts by GM's. They wont do anything about pvp. Its fair game. Go play on a pve server if your not ok with it.
---
Break yourselves upon my body!
---
Cata heroics were awesome. They dropped the ball by not making max level nm versions of the leveling dungeons, leaving people who sucked too much for heroics with nothing to do.
---
I too cried and quit when they nerfed them. Fuck the baddies demanding all content to be easy. Fuck them so hard.
---
Yeah it's a great video. I'm loving seeing the arena getting so much love in the classic beta.
---
Ah that's good to hear. Hadn't seen that tweet
---
I would assume they are going to add the items and quests at their appropriate phases, since they said they would do progressive item additions.
---
According to Itemization.info, this would mean Sulfuras in phase 2 (patch 1.4) and Thunderfury in phase 3 (patch 1.6).
---
It sounds like you really like alliance. You didn't even list any cons for them.
---
r/classicwowplus   
---
The problem with retail is not just spoling but that's a completely different game.
---
Class mechanics are very different from Classic, talents and abilities different, even zones are different, so if you start playing retail now you'll be quite confused in Classic.
---
Play retail if you're interested *in retail* but if you want to do it in "preparation" for Classic, just don't.
---
As for other MMOs, none of the modern ones are similar to Classic but if you're looking for just *anything* to play, I suggest GW2 or SWTOR, they're free to play and very easy to get into.
---
I've been researching reputation on and off for the past year. A safe bet is that reputation will experience a reduction of around 42 to 50% per quest. However, spill over reputation will exist and allow you to make up some of that lost ground.  
---
The reputation values on private servers are from the patch 2.0.1 reputation increase which was almost entirely undocumented and not talked about.
---
Had my account since 2004, no beta access, no stress test invite. Thanks Blizzard.  
---
But I'd rather just play the finished game then blowing my load on beta anyways.
---
Great. I could link you lots of people having 'heated' discussions about whether vaccines cause autism. That doesn't make them have validity.
---
&gt; less than 25% of players actually vote
---
Yes, that's pretty typical. Even in presidential elections only ~50% of people vote.
---
I would also say that the 25% that do vote are likely to be better informed etc than a large chunk of those who do not.
---
If you choose not to vote then that is your choice. You have however forfeited your best chance at influencing said decision.
---
I can't speak to why they did "integrity updates", however I would say that it is certain that they have more data, and more information than you, or any other player has. There will be a reason for their decision.
---
Regardless, this is going very off topic. You replied to someone saying that the approach of adding new content etc to the original game (OSRS) allowed it to thrive.
---
You said it did not. Objectively the numbers prove that it did.
---
Your feelings regarding polls or jagex or whatever aren't the original subject and I doubt many people here care.
---
Classic is hyped. Played pserv until me and gf got beta. Now we only play beta lol.
---
Love this gaaaaym
---
Why though, new one looks better. Classic isn't supposed to be 100% vanilla experience.
---
look, its not about the objective pros vs cons. just listen to the words "alliance" and "horde" and let your heart take you to where you need to be
---
It may have never ceased but the more people you stick together, the greater the likelihood that people can't play nice with each other.
---
&gt; You said it did not.
---
My first character was a NElf Druid, I got to 45 or so. Then Aussie servers came out, I rolled Horde and never looked back.
---
Now I fucking love the Horde to bits...but should I play Alliance instead this time around, just to freshen things up?
---
Ranji got cucked by a chad during high school
---
maybe if you have eye cancer it does
---
you are saying re-releasing older expansion is *slightly less expensive* than making new one from ground up?  
---
lmao
---
Any tips to lvl hunter that fast?
---
then it's alliance for sure
---
the thing is, my irl mates will start playing classic and they're all horde...
---
I'm always staggered when someone calls wotlk the best expansion. It was literally the downfall for dungeons.
---
It had great (for the time) leveling, 2 awesome raids and...???
---
Naxx remake was shameful and 0 fun. Dungeons were utterly braindead and thanks to tokens awarded way too good catch up gear. Dungeon finder was introduced in wrath wasn't it?
---
I mean sure wrath had its moments. The story being driven by one of the most popular characters in wow lore certainly helped. But it was also a huge step towards world of idontreallycareanymorecraft and it irks me that people hold it in such high regard
---
Note to mods: This video is from a private server. Violates rule 1.
---
Exposing immature ragers = being cucked in highschool logic 101
---
Yeah but it's not a meme. The stupid stress test ruined BFA for me and now I can't even stomach to play WoW until Classic comes out.
---
This is the first I have ever heard of this and I played a hunter since beta in vanilla through TBC (although took multiple breaks from the class).  That being said I also never really measured how big my pet was either so who knows.  The only changes on pet size I knew of was when you originally tamed a mob they would no longer be the same size as the non-pet NPC, as they were scaled up/down appropriately.
---
Rouges are Great in duels and Solo world pvp
---
They are good in casual bgs
---
They are kinda useless in premade bgs, usually limited to covering flag room if at all in the lineup.
---
They are completely obsolete in mass world pvp
---
For some reason I didnt even think about him having ranged attacks lol
---
Taken 2 weeks off. Told partner i will basically be unresponsive for those 2 weeks. She's been warned
---
On point
---
Welcome to Vanilla
---
They said no but I hope they change it

Hi, /u/focusabathurguys

 [score hidden] 2 hours ago 
---
&gt;It worked great for osrs.
---
Has it? 
---
--------
---
That wasn't hard to do.
---
You literally responded to the OP. Who made a thread saying should it go to TBC or to new additional content (1.13).
---
He said new content worked for OSRS. You said "Has it?" posing that it had not.
---
The objective numbers show that OSRS was dieing, until new content etc was added - at which point it thrived.
---
As someone who has played on pservers before I am utterly confused as to why you wouldn't just wait in anticipation. Since it was announced I have lost all interest in pservers and will never play on one again when Classic releases.
---
Screw trying to refresh my skills beforehand or some other bullshit like that, I'ma rediscover all that live by getting my ass stomped until I git gud.
---
[It currently looks like they won't bring back the unarmored epic mounts](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit#riding), but who knows; maybe they'll change their mind.
---
For those that can't click the link to the soruce:
---
&gt;**We know a lot going into the six-phase plan now, and the decision on progressive itemization cleared a lot of remaining topics up. Is there any content that’s a grey area you’d like to clarify? For example, can you get old-school mounts up until a certain phase? Or will Classic WoW only have the current vendor exalted mounts.** 
---
&gt;It is the current vendor mounts for 1.12. We aren't putting back the unarmored mounts. We just talked about this recently internally. We know some people are interested in them, but we don't want to put them in for a limited period of time, because we didn't want to influence people through their first leveling experience. Especially people coming back for the first time. We don't want people to feel like they have to rush. If you want to level slowly and enjoy the journey, you should. That's how I like to play--taking it slow, running every dungeon.

---
This is correct.  We used to do 40 ubrs to get onyxia keys.  Also you had to run though BRD to get to MC before they added the blood elf guy outside.
---
Sadly I didn't get any footage of a rogue opening with Skull of Impending Doom, which would render this one trick pony useless. :/ Obviously its a compeltely unviable tactic and spec on Classic, but lap+CC is a fun trick to surprise a rogue with occasionally.
---
Do I require BFA to play classic or can I just renew my sub on my old account?
---
Mage is gonna be my main at first to get gold and level quick then im gonna funnel some money into my warrior to make levelling easier. Love mage pvp and aoe farming hate raiding mc and bwl just spamming frostbolt sucks whereas fury is fun and engaging with stance swapping and rage management etc.
---
It's legit fucked up that they ask for a subscription to opt in and then invite so few. That's scummy as hell. If they knew they were going to invite almost nobody in order to "promote hype," without saying any such thing to the community, tricking people into subbing is a historically slimy dick move, but people are too hyped to realize.
---
you wont be able to get the four twitch primes required in chat at all times either
---
Damn, misrepresenting the conversation like a slimeball. Can I call you Sleazy Silent189? 
---
You left out what followed my rhetorical question: “The OSRS voting system is a total meme.”
---
But I understand why you'd leave that out, because I was specifically talking about whether or not the voting system has been the best way to add content or not (with evidence as to why it hasn't been.)
---
But great way to sleaze it up, sleazy.
---
If I wanted to multi-box Classic Wow, do I need any original versions of WoW to play? Or can i create a blank battlenet account and just pay $15/mo?
---
Lol the guy in OPs picture really thought the world of himself xD

Guild drama, as everyone else is saying, never went away though. Art imitates life, and life is not short on friction between people :p

[Especially if your name is Dave and you're a sadistic, raging alcoholic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSSiHh9ShU)

Boomkin can do both, or tank druid, even healing druid is good in both.
---
I had eleven copies of WoW, six copies of TBC and one of everything else (except BfA which I never bought). I’ll have at least two Classic accounts running. I’ve seen multi boxers running forty accounts simultaneously. The mind boggles. I guess we just know a good thing when we see it.
---
&gt; AM I required to upgrade my account to BFA to play classic
---
No, a subscription to World of Warcraft is all you'll need in order to play Classic.
---
Unless you have a group of 5 premade and can almost guarantee 0 wipes, then usually no dungeons are worth it. Otherwise if you have 3+ quests than it can maybe be worthwhile.
---
Not sure I understand.  Are you calling seduction into soul fire a trick?
---
I tend to do them all, except for Uldaman and Sunken Temple because I don't like them.
---
The bags thing was hilarious when I played. I had more bags than bag slots by level 10. So off.
---
Its been hard friend, they hurt us deeper than the rest.
---
My friends and I all started alliance during TBC. But then they edged out and wanted to be Horde during cata 'to freshen it up' and I never enjoyed the cities and quest hubs as much as alliance (though I did love Tauren for my Druid). 
---
Anyway I think that considering Classic is about going back and enjoying the game and the world as you did then, I think you should also stick with how you most enjoyed it, as Horde.
---
I mean, some people just don't like suffering and wasting their life (I do, pls don't harrass me).
---
90% of streamers are US and 90% of invites went to streamers and their buddies.
---
Warrior is the default choice for me. I leveled w/o talent points to 54 back in '05. Went prot as soon as I found out about them. Prot was a very popular spec on Spinebreaker alliance. I'd expect to see more this time around. 
---
I think warrior might just be popular in general this time around. Which makes me worry about getting a scrub Mt/OT for a PUG that doesnt know wtf he is doing. I used to respec 2-3 times a week on average. Prot for raid and arms for farm/pvp
---
This was a few years back but I was able to just create multiple (starter) accounts and multibox.
---
Pretty much all, at least one run through to hit all the quest rewards in one go. Maybe a few more farm runs if there's a particularly strong upgrade you need to make your leveling easier.
---
Wdym dude you told me that it happened. That's why you're ganking people right?
---
LAP - Goblin Rocket Helm - SF.  
---
Rogues that see you with no pet (in this case because the imp is sacced for 15% fire dmg) will open with shadow reflector/WOTF ready, to negate seduce.
---
Thanks. Didn't want to have to buy retail when I will never play it!
---
Will there be EU servers at launch or only US?
---
I think you mean optimal instead of viable here.
---
Oh man do I regret not picking up that collectors edition back in the day. Looks great, bud.
---
&gt; If I wanted to multi-box Classic Wow, do I need any original versions of WoW to play? Or can i create a blank battlenet account and just pay $15/mo?
---
Blizzard changed the way the game has to be purchased with BfA (or was it Legion?).     
---
Basically everything but the latest expansion is free with just a subscription and only if you want to play the latest expansion do you actually have to purchase a game.
---
Since Classic only requires a sub, that's all you're going to need.
---
Dude lost 6.6k HP falling halfway down that first hill, that's nowhere near classic numbers.
---
This was possibly the least efficient/most obnoxious thing ever.  My guild did same thing for ony keys.  40 man run of UBRS to get 1 person keyed ...  Eventually we split into 2 20ish man groups to speed up the overall process and competed for which group could finish first.  Was so glad when they eventually made multiple quest drops from drakkisath but I think we had already finished at that point.
---
this is B S tbh
---
i was 15 in vanilla, now im nearly 30 and i have a career and ive paid my dues in all the times i had to quit wow in tbc/wrath/cata because of college
---
ive earned taking 2 weeks off for this shit
---
and its because of handling my life responsibilities
---
whats your excuse?
---
If you have reliable people to play with it can be fine but if you plan on solo for large stretches it can be pretty miserable.
---
Would you tie one hand behind your back before going into a boxing match?
---
Your answer to that question tells you if you want to level as a prot warrior or not.
---
I mean there is an element of private servers that is inherently different than being on live. The nature of "ooooh aaaah secret place Blizzard doesn't control" is there so some people act out in ways that maybe they wouldn't last long on live after enough reports.
---
However, the vast majority of my experience on private server has essentially been near identical to live.
---
The cancer happens when you roll F R E S H. If you roll with that wave, ya, you're gonna see the seat of the pants players who just don't give a shit about their attitude or actions because they're gone in a month or two anyway.
---
If you roll somewhere established, it's just the same as a live server. People looking for groups, selling things in trade, sometimes chatting about the latest political news or telling jokes.
---
Like, I often forget I'm even playing on a "private" server. Right now I'm playing on Netherwing (the best TBC option), and replaying progression through SSC TK has been awesome and immersive, I don't even remember I'm on a private server I just feel like I'm actually playing TBC.
---
Yes, there will be EU servers.
---
Now its coming back to me,that change just killed it for me. Because it meant Blizz only cared about getting you max as fast as possible, that the fun ceased being the journey and was soley the endgame.
---
Nah man go for it. You do you.
---
Still a better ending than Game Of Thrones?
---
I did it in 2005 and it was a real pain. It works, but it is very slow and you will likely prefer leveling in dungeons or questing in a group. But: you will meet a lot of people and make friends. If you are a social player and don't mind being behind the pack, you can go for it!
---
300% skillcapped
---
Ah, Hunter gameplay with HunterxHunter music :) Nice vid ! Soloing is a great part of WoW that I feel was way more interesting in the first expansions of WoW, when most classes didnt have defensive CDs/Heal and it required truly perfect gameplay. I'm really looking forward to do it again.
---
Hopefully there is a 6 month cool down.
---
Those are completely different things. Flying is something that changed the game for everyone. Trying to be the best you can be at the game or choosing to play a in a competitive/some other specific way is the player’s choice. No ones forcing it on you. You just sound like a whiner who just wants things to go back they way they were when you were playing as a kid.
---
I was a SW lurker back in vanilla. My PC simply could't handle IF.

Your identical post was removed earlier. That should be a clue to whether or not you should repost it.
---
Pretty cool stuff! :-)
---
I'm wondering this too. I think maybe Burning Crusade?
---
Experiencewise (as in xp/hour): only the ones next to your leveling routes that you have all the quests for, have a ready-made group for that knows what they are doing and doesn't wipe at all, and even then only once. (because you can do the quests only once) 
---
Experiencewise (as in your personal experience): God dang it all of them. Sheer amount of dungeons and small stories inside them still keeps astonishing me almost 15 years later. I have many lovely memories of every single one of the vanilla dungeons, memories and experiences I will deviantly savour till the end of my days, giving me delight for many years to come. From deadmines to scarlet monastery death runs, from bootybay gnomer teleports to the farting Queen of maraudon, I simply adore classic dungeons. Find friends, search and find the dungeon, and experience all what vanilla has to offer. 
---
Or just follow a leveling path and enjoy the Vietnam of StV,  that's pretty fun too.
---
It's a unique chapter in WoW, complete with its own meta and events. While it's more limited in scope than the full game, it's still something that clearly has a huge appeal and has inspired all kinds of events and discussion. There's an upcoming duel tournament that will surely generate millions upon millions of views across the various content creators. This is basically a WoW spin-off show that almost nobody gets to watch. Could you imagine if only a few thousand Breaking Bad fans were invited to watch Better Call Saul?
---
I'm glad to hear I was right in my memory. I'm really looking forward to some of those bigger dungeons.
---
Don't recommend it
---
All? Some interesting items will drop even from the lowest ones and if you collect all quests for them the exp gain is on par or better than questing/grinding outside(if doing smoothly). So at least one run for each dungeon is worth it(unless you know you hate it lol like some people hate f.e. gnomer)
---
Rush to 60. Farm some gold, invest your gold into buying reagents used lategame, blues for twinking etc at a cheap early server price as not as much gold in circulation, wait a few months and cash in.
---
Don't level as prot. Please. The rotation for prot is different but the core of the spec live through out each spec. You wont struggle to transition.
---
Just to say it. Prot does less damage in general but you will also take less damage which will translate into much slower kills combined. At later levels with trinkets and shield spikes it can be a bit more friendly but warrior is already the slowest class to level. don't do that!
---
The element of WPvP adds a lot of excitment but it's frustrating as hell if your main is just ment for PvE, to fill a specific roll for dungeons and raiding that makes him almost useless in a PvP scenario.
---
Once Classic launches and i buy a sub for WoW \[only played in Burning Crusade period\], I'll still probably go to a PVP server just for the added flavor that makes the whole Alliance Vs Horde thing feel more real, it has a lot of grieffing,trolling and toxicity but it does add a lot to the game's world. Even though i'm not someone who's into PVPing much in MMORPGs \[pretty much just sticked to PvE in every MMO i played WoW,GW2,ESO\] i still like the fear and exciting element that out of nowhere i could bump into an enemy that's not just an AI, it adds more a dynamic threat element to the game to make it feel more alive, it's kinda like why i loved the invasion elements of the dark souls games a lot.
---
Am I the crazy one/misremembering?  Everyone is saying they didn't get bindings to drop until post-BWL?  I could have sworn we had something like bindings drop off Garr at one point pretty early on.  Although I guess it did get moved to Rag-only later?  My memory is a mess but it has been over a decade.

**THOU SHALL NOT PASS** this terms classes.

ITT: People arguing about what negative change had more impact on the game.
---
Pretty sure this was changed at some point because it was abused so much. Someone queued you for a BG and you'd just instantly /afk to fast-travel to Orgrimmar or whatever city you needed to go to.
---
You you do me a favour and point out where in this thread, prior to your comment, you found someone speaking about the OSRS voting system?
---
Nobody fucking asked about the voting system, or for your opinion on it.
---
You PURPOSEFULLY responded to his comment in a way that made it appear OSRS was NOT thriving as aresult of new content.
---
It FACTUALLY is.
---
Whether you like the polling system or not is of no relevance. Nobody cares. 
---
YOU misrepresented things from the start, whether intentionally or because you simply have a complex and feel the need to shoehorn your OSRS polling vs into every thread you see I don't know.
---
So pretending to attack my character in order to deflect from your own is a pathetic attempt at best.
---
It's not for everyone and that's ok
---
You nostalgia dads are all gonna quit when you get farmed in wsg. It’s 2019.
---
The last one didn't look tilted, just a tad disappointed...
---
Well autochess went from 100k stable to under 15k stable in twitch. Also the ingame numbers have gone down. That should provide enough evidence
---
Think we need a full summoning ritual
---
Effectively killed world pvp too. So easy to just fly away.

I watched it like 5 times and now I am going to watch it again.

Must be the Rick and Morty of video game cities.  I just don't get the hype...

RemindMe! 94 days
---
Hmm... see edit about Shaman. I do also really like all the Horde races, and not so much the Alliance ones. Aaaargh I would love to go through the other side of the world though, ya know?
---
Awesome. Why is this? From what I remember of sp in tbc onwards, they always got shit on by melee for the lack of escapes they had
---
&gt; You you do me a favour and point out where in this thread, prior to your comment, you found someone speaking about the OSRS voting system?
---
Wow, didn't realize you were the gate-keeper of what people discussed or the relevancy of certain comments. Amazing. Not only do you misrepresent other people's arguments and conversations, but you are also the content-police.
---
&gt; YOU misrepresented things from the start
---
I add nuance to a conversation about OSRS, especially with regards to its voting system. You are telling me that the topic is off limits!
---
Maybe stop policing other people's conversations and you'll stop feeling so triggered ;)
---
IIRC you want 1 enh shaman in melee group for imp wf totem tho.
---
Hunter FD?
---
The excuse they gave is so shoddy that I think there's a chance they might. We don't need blizzard protecting us from leveling too quickly as if we can't make our own choices.
---
Sounds like you just don’t like raiding? Lucky for you you can still have fun in vanilla without raiding. Maybe just let others have fun how they want instead of complaining because you’re not good at it?
---
*Tips monocle*
---
Priest if the two people i know end up playing with me, Warlock if i'm alone, Rogue if i want to ever dip into PvP and be a horrible person that's hated by everyone.
---
Yes, classic wow.
---
Thanks for taking the time to put that together.
---
No it won't be difficult, it will just be more time consuming to level up. And afaik warrior is already the slowest class at speed running
---
It was during vanilla. It seemed like an early change to me so I am curious which month of which year. I started in june 05 and im lost on the time scale atm.
---
I'd agree that the Mage did some mistakes.
---
* The first Blink was unnecessary
---
* Chasing the Paladin in the hut was a bad decision
---
* Polymorph was a bad idea
---
To the Blink: There was plenty of space. He could have outrun the Blessig of Freedom and slowed him after that. If the Mage was afraid of Hammer of Justice or Bubble, he still could have used Blink after the cooldown was burned. The Blink gave Esfand the opportunity to run away - which he did without hesitation. The Mage made a mistake and Esfand took the opportunity.
---
To the chase: Mages benefit from open field. In the hut Esfand could play the LoS game as much as he wants. And the Mage has to engage into close combat. He could have let go or wait outside the hut. Engaging a Ret Paladin in close combat as a Mage is no good idea.
---
To the Polymorph:
---
At this point the combat was pretty much lost. Esfand didn't use his Bubble or Hammer of Justice yet and the mage just blinked. Hammer was on cool down, but the Mage probably did not know that. He should have used the range to just run away. But he chose to give Esfand time to close the game and eventually kill him.
---
Overall the Mage misplayed alot and Esfand punished every single mistake. The Furbolg form bait isn't even a mistake by the Mage in my opinion, it's just the icing on the cake.
---
Instances like strat were capped for 10man in patch 1.3 and capped to 5man in 1.10
---
Concerning trends I remind that with my first lvl60 it was common to raid it with 10 players but a few months later, people were 5man-ing them as intended
---
You could before patch 1.3 (Dire Maul). But that's also when they added the attunement to MC to bypass BRD.
---
&gt; Not only do you misrepresent other people's arguments and conversations, but you are also the content-police!
---
So in other words, you can't. So now that you've realised you look like a tool you're going to try and play it off as trolling.
---
&gt;You are telling me that OSRS's voting system is off limits in this thread!
---
I said nothing of the sort. I told you it wasn't relevant and nobody here gives a shit about your opinion on the subject.
---
You're free to do what you want, you just look like an idiot.
---
You've being very defensive and getting very upset, along side trying to attack my character personally... for someone who supposedly isn't the "triggered" one 😂
---
And he’s a horde paladin.
---
u mad brah would suit pretty well right there
---
Nobody plays 4e though. Its either 3.5 or 5.
---
People want it the way it used to be because that's how it was in vanilla and that's fair enough  
---
However it's pretty funny that people are actually trying to argue that the old unpolished method is more realistic and makes more sense. You are sliding across the ground for fuck sake lol
---
Except when you don't have aggro when you level with friends.. Thats why i'm opting out of this spec and just go for a backstab build.
---
Also if e.g. you're a priest... alliance have better priest racials (fearward and desperate prayer ftw). For PvE humans also have that +spirit %, faster rep gains as added bonuses... but for PvP WotF is just dammed amazing.... basically a free pvp trinket at lvl1
---
Oh, I was watching it on my phone and couldn't make out buffs or nothin'.
---
Engi and alch is pretty strong.
---
No there isn't
---
On guild creation, how many ranks does a guild have, what are they called, and how are they ordered (top to bottom)?
---
Is it 5 ranks, named and ordered exactly like this?
---
* Leader
---
* Officer
---
* Veteran
---
* Member
---
* Initiate
---
either multiboxlove or changing keys for gold with unnamed farmers :p
---
No it's really not. If you don't mind it taking a year to level then sure, go ahead. But if you realistically wanna do some end game content then level the proper way.
---
I do the exact same thing on a daily basis
---
worst idea ever
---
How can you get thunderfury without having killed ragnaros \^thinkingemoji\^
---
I miss the teacher was actually a bear post from the dmaw forums :(
---
Yes, probably. But we're discussing a hypothetical situation here. What happens if a majority of Retail players make a permanent switch to Classic on the long term?
---
Raiding in Classic WoW is far easier than raiding in FF14 or retail WoW from a mechanics standpoint (both bosses and classes).  If your guild has 121 members, you’re more than fine. 
---
There really isn’t a ‘best’ loot distribution system. You have to use what works for you and your guild.
---
Probably the most generic recruitment video I've seen. Why not spice it up a little? Kinda like this:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH0FNoo3vcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH0FNoo3vcE)
---
How much do you get paid for that in your county?
---
This definitely happened to me the first time I queued for a bg in vanilla. I found myself in a brand new city I'd never seen (Stormwind). Tbh, even back then I figured it was a bug.
---
Exactly!
---
Our guild uses those ranks:
---
* Guild Master    
---
* Officer    
---
* Officer-Alt    
---
* Class Leader   
---
* Raider   
---
* Friend   
---
* Alt   
---
* Trial 
---
But I guess you could do with less.
---
Any spe is viable for leveling, about the prot warrior I wouldn't say its difficult but **it's slow af.** Keep in mind that most of low lvl dungeons can be tanked with your dps spes. For example i remember a lot of Wailing Caverns runs with fury warriors equiped with a shield and a very fast dagger to maintain a solid threat. Vanilla gear isnt normalized there is plenty of room for atypic builds
---
&gt; ok so say someone joins and they dont list any mc gear just gear from raids after that?
---
&gt; i think thats how id try and manipulate it
---
&lt;Onslaught&gt; isn't a first-come first-serve raiding guild. If there's another player that performs better than you not currently in the raid, you will be replaced. Holding off to get any gear until BWL drops means you likely won't be in the BWL team.
---
&gt; if people no show you need standby's waiting to fill spots , those people are never happy and being on the bench caused a lot of salt in vanilla.
---
There's really no such thing as a no-show in &lt;Onslaught&gt;. They have so many raid teams and often split their raid teams up to 20-man the content that there's almost always a spot. If you meet their standards, you will get into one of the raid teams.
---
tell that to female dwarf players
---
Comfy. FeelsOkayMan 👌
---
&gt; least played class in vanilla, any vanilla experts out there that can tell me why exactly 
---
They are the least played because there's only one class available per faction to play Druids. Many people try to find gameplay explanations, while in reality the vast majority of players play what they like from a visual/lore perspective long before thinking about racials and endgame. 
---
Visuals are also why there are significantly more Druids on Alliance side than on Horde side (Night elves being way more popular than Taurens), and why there was a clear Alliance/Horde population unbalance in Vanilla in favor of the Alliance, which literally vanished with BC once Blood Elves got introduced as an Horde race. The better looking faction had the most players,a s simple as that.
---
Concerning Druid gameplay, it's super fun and has a lot of variety, but can be unsatisfying, as you're rarely be on top of any meters without tons of effort comparatively to other classes, wether it's DPS or Heal, and generally won't be an extremely valuable individual in most Endgame content, wether in PvP or in PvE (with some exceptions of course). 
---
This is all, really. For the rest, Druid is awesome as you can Heal/Tank/DPS dungeons and solo farm in a single spec at max level, can run away from most fights in WPvP and generally avoid ganking with stealth, you have an easier time to gear up because of the lack of Druid players, and as nobody expects you to top meters in raid you have 0 pressure on you. It's lovely, really.
---
He was, but it's not a very uniqe name though. I bet there is thousands of players going by that name.
---
All the comments I've seen here have said it's once per spell, but as yet I haven't seen anyone confirm it from either being on the beta or watching somebody stream Clearcasting on the beta (they've all just been assuming that's how it works on the beta)
---

---
There is no way you could do alexei with any healer/tank combo that doesn't have a druid because of the curse debuff and I also highly doubt you could gandling without a tank that can heal himself and a healer that can tank.
---
Please stop making this thread. This has been discussed ad nauseum.
---
No, I perfectly understand it, but it's that part of the fallacy that makes it a fallacy. Most things aren't slopes, a slope implies that BECAUSE you made the first change, other things will also change. But there's no logical reason why that would be the case.
---
And NO, it is not more likely, BECAUSE it is not a slope. How can you honestly not get this. They have already made changes compared to classic - updated graphics, auto-fill mail, etc. Those things do not bring us closer to LFR in any way. They could have very well pulled us further away from LFR from a pragmatic standpoint, but that is not a cause and effect relationship either.
---
In truth, Classic WoW was always bound to follow a different path than vanilla WoW did back in 2005 and things will be different, but your aversion to each change that they make should be on the basis of the merits and demerits of the change itself, not because of other changes that you think could follow.
---
Yeah, I think you'll often need more than the default, and also maybe change them if your guild has a theme or anything. "Friend" rank :D
---
I'm just looking for what the defaults are though, for something I am making.
---
Got mine on the 8th. But if you look at it in a positive way you might find more people to group up with.
---
new generation, new names
---
all the memes
---
Lol you bullshitter you xD
---
Nah man,
---
https://youtu.be/OdWiUzV110A
---
It's a fact that Retail players generate more income than Classic. They both pay a subscription, but the Retail player also spends X amount of dollars each month on top of the subscription. Classic can never spend more than a subscription per month. Unless of course they introduce microtransactions in Classic as well.
---
We can hope that more players in total proves to be more profitable, even if the average WoW player convert down to a lower profit margin.  
---
I think either way, if we sit 1 year out from launch with 1+ million Classic players, there will be a strong incentive for Blizzard to increase monetization of Classic.
---
This is good feedback, glad to see beta testers actually using the beta for its stated purpose: testing and making comprehensive reports.
---
YOU SMELL THAT??
---
This is maybe two years from now. WoW Classic could be dead by then. If it's not, Blizzard will figure it out then, but they're not entertaining any ideas right now. All they've said is TBC and WotLK servers are possible if the community is large enough to warrant them. I seriously doubt Blizzard is going to spend any design or developer manpower on re-making content beyond "get it working and release it".
---
*Classic* *is* *harder* *than* *retail* *while* *levelling* *because* *the* *game* *is* *poorly* *designed.*
---
There you go, summed up in one sentence. :)
---
"Everyone has Naxx on farm" Unlikely alot of people will have Naxx on farm or even go through naxx, not that its overly difficult, yes it has its hurdles but people know the Mechanics and Consumables needed to just swish on through hardest part is just getting the people. Most the player base wont be having Naxx on farm only the hardcore.   
---
That being said I reckon after a couple years they will release either content for Vanilla like OSRS have done or just release BC legacy server. I would love to see BC legacy server without flying though, would certainly be interesting and they'd have to change some things but overall alot of people consider BC the pinnacle its just a shame flying is in it.
---
I don't have it :') well I got access to the stress test, but I had to work with clips and all for documentation, sad
---
People like me? I haven't downvoted a soul. I assumed this reddit would be full of mature gamers who accepted people had differing opinions.
---
I stand by my opinion, the way a griffon glides affects nothing. Doesn't affect gameplay or immersion. I hope they fix it, but i don't see it as a priority at all.
---
Don't think people owe an apology for being wrong though. But it sounds like he concedes to your point. That should be enough for you.
---
its the same for walking backwards, it's supposed to be smooth not 'steppy'
---
Yeah, like, community and interaction still existed plenty in TBC and early Wrath. 
---
As far as killing world pvp, well, if they were flying away, they clearly didn't want to pvp in the first place. You aren't entitled to waste other peoples time.
---
Regarding macros:
---
#showtooltip Backstab
---
/startattack
---
/cast Backstab
---
Does this mean my macro will use the highest rank of my BS ability?
---
You can do it if you want to, but you are just slowing yourself down for no real benefit.
---
&gt; I'm just looking for what the defaults are though, for something I am making.
---
Ah yes, I think the default ranks are indeed: Initiate, Member, Veteran, Officer, and Leader.
---
&gt; I think right now everyone is wondering what Blizzard will do after everyone has Naxx on farm. 
---
No. It's just you and your original thoughts.
---
Just a note IF will probably end up the main alliance city like it used to be as itll be closest to relevant content
---
Honestly I have no idea. I didn’t know the night elf one existed. Do you have a picture of it?
---
You deviant, you!
---
Pretty annoying yes. Before you could just check your account for a PTR account but now you need to actually login..
---
Thank you for the information. I'm thinking that at the start a few stealth runs on easy bosses can ensure some loot before doing full runs later on :)
---
Here y’all go

---
Unlikely to be possible in Classic (except for 10 man UBRS/LBRS) as it was changed in 1.10.
---
This video was the reason I leveled a priest back in the day. Too bad they made many of the npcs immune to mindcontrol.
---
How realistic is it to have gold for mount at 40? It seems completly unreasonable on a fresh server with no auction house activity? 
---
After watching some classic beta, people seem to have 4-7G at level 30.
---
I kinda agree,. its like he is saying ''this is the druid playstyle in vanilla and I don't like it''. Well if that's the case don't role druid? 
---
I'm unsure whether this post is about asking for advice on how he can improve or say ''i was high rated and this class doesn't feel good'' to insinuate that the class needs changes (never going to happen). Anyway a lot of classes/specs in vanilla feel underwhelming and the truth of the matter is, don't play them unless you are willing to face that fact.
---
Ah yes, I'm not opposed to normal runs, but if ever a group forms up then I was thinking it would be a good option.
---
Tanks aren't in short supply for raids, its dungeons where warriors want to dps using heroic strike as their dps ability even though they have cleave/slam.
---
The reset instance command or drop down doesn't work when you're inside the instance. You have to make your own way back to the entrance, either by dying and corpse running, or just turning around.
---
And you only get 5 instances per hour (for all dungeons combined).
---
I have been able to find most of all books on this, good luck
---
http://gen.lib.rus.ec/
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I doubt it. I don't think you'll naturally become exalted with any racial faction just from quests by level 40.
---
My hunter still sits in my character list with her OG Humar the Pridelord :)
---
Thanks for the info. I guess stealth runs on early BRD bosses to get some easy loot before doing full runs might be the way to go. :)
---
I had a slightly different one playing during BC.
---
Leveling a paladin, in ashenvale in low 20s. Group of 4 enemy players come along. Gank me while I was fighting something. Oh well rez, and get back to it. No, back they come and do it again.
---
So I relog my 70 rogue. Kill them all. Relog paladin. Continue, but they're not perturbed. They gank me again. Ok, relog rogue kill them all twice. I go back to leveling.
---
Then I see them again with their 70 mage guildie. Gank me once more. So I relog rogue, sap the mage kill them, and then the mage.
---
After that, I wasn't bothered any more.
---
I suspect the mage was pve geared though. Which makes me wonder why he wanted to take on a rogue.
---
I really liked IF as well, ty for the response!
---
The first clip looks awful.
---
How it looks in classic is much better.
---
Oceania is a thing too you know. ;)
---
Coolio :)
---
Good stuff, definitely got a bit scared when he pointed that out. Thanks!
---
Oh good not this autistic screeching again. Please don't let mentally challenged people post in Reddit.
---
I respect that, but if you're neutral it's better not to react that way. You can see a lot of people care about this, so maybe you think it doesn't but it DOES affect immersion. Just maybe not for you. When you spend most your travel time on flight paths, you'd rather have them immersive, look like actual birds and not dead flying seats... We disagree and that's fine, but stating your opinion as facts does not work, especially in a beta where the point is to recreate the original experience. This is wrong, I said it, that's it
---
UD rogues also negate one of priests best defences
---
I don't want an apology for him being wrong, I want an apology for my arguments being called "nonsensical" and "bullshit".
---
Nice link dude
---
Personally, I was here for the gameplay, not the graphics.
---
To each his own I guess.
---

---
Sunday Fishing Tournament - not so much a quest, but being able to turn into a fish in Arathi Basin PVP is a must :-)
---
What is "worth" to you? I'll be trying to do all of them once.
---
I might be misremembering but the game was never on cds.. Iirc cds only hold a few hundred megabytes and even the original game was several gb, almost definitely sure it was 4 dvds.. Again I culd be misremembering.
---
Thanks for your reply! I think druid's very interesting but I'm a little intimidated by the shapeshifting playstyle. Seems kinda hard!
---
Any classic+ ought to be a one way character transfer. We should keep pure vanilla servers around forever
---
You think you don't, but you do.
---
This reddit is not, i repeat not, an accurate reflection of what people want or care about.
---
I could discover a gnome's nose was 0.1mm smaller than it should be and it would get 500 upvotes. That's just the circlejerk atm. I've watched  dozens of hours of new classic streams and not a single mention was made of it. That's more telling imo.
---
On the flip side, i've seen many errors that streamers have flagged up which everyone agrees needs a fix. Not griffon flights though. Wonder why??
---
It feels like the start of the animation is played over and over again.
---
don't think it worked like this on live.
---
Realm transfers and name changes were a thing in at least TBC (I quit after wotlk came out).
---
Ion already stated that any "new vanilla content" is a definite no. Why are you making these dumb threads?
---
"Your opinion is not the same as my opinion so therefore it is wrong."
---
Really dude?
---
The rate at which you get gold picks up a bit after level 30.      
---
As long as you don't buy too much stuff from vendors or the auction house and only learn new spells that you actually need for leveling you should be fine. If not you'll probably have the mount at around 42 the latest.
---
From what I remember of warrior talents, being pure prot doesn’t even make you a better tank for five mans until high end raiding. The ideal is probably hybrid
---
Well I for once support your logic, as it is mine as well. Silly of him to use derogatory language though.
---
Blast from the past!
---
My friends are rolling Horde too, but I told them I was going Alliance early so there's no hard feelings.
---
Everyone hangs out at either Undercity from Hot Blackrock Mountain/Naxx action, or ThunderBluff for AQ.
---
For me it's what do I want to play. A oversized Bullman that can potentially delete people with a windfury is right up there.
---
Gameplay being the same &gt; graphics/animations being the same.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
I have never played classic back in the day but I‘ve been active on p-servers. My exporience from there is that the game by itself is not „harder“. But the retail version is much more forgiving. 
---
For ex. Questing nowdays - get the quest, go to the marked spot on the minimap, pull everything you see, nuke it, hand in the quest, repeat.
---
In classic you had to get the quest (what was hard by itself, because there were no quest marks on the minimap -&gt; find everything by random walking in buildings), then you had to read the quest for the informations (there were no marks on your map) and thus you has to quiet walk around some time, when you found the exact point you were not able to pull everything. After 2-3 mobs you are 100% out of mana. 
---
The fact that there was no accountboubd lvl 1 mount and that you had to get to lvl 40 to even be able to buy the 60% mount (IF you were wealthy enough) slowed that leveling down as well.
---
You normally didn‘t have enough money to buy all new ability levels. So you had to chose between them for what suits you most/is the most valued for you
---
Neither do you.
---
:/
---
ye I guess we can still be on the same discord and enjoy playing, I could just catch up with them later
---
Hmmm...PooFlinger?
---
So because I'm specific with my information rather than being vague, that causes you to mistrust me? Alright man have fun in the game.
---
Hate to burst your bubble, but retail vanilla had cast bar addons too.
---
But does the /camp work? And u should log back in and be infront of the instance and should be reset.
---
Pssh taken from a private server! I can tell by some of the pixels.
---
Hey all, I’ve never had a bank alt but I feel like classic might be a good opportunity to get one. Could someone please explain how best to use?one (other than a good name and fancy clothes) thank you :)
---
Yeah, it would actually make more sense if you didn't know exact numbers after not having played for such a long time. You naming specific enemy health numbers even though it's been over 10 years and you couldn't see enemy health in vanilla without the use of addons, raises a major red flag.
---
Its almost as if they are testing it in beta and they haven't locked anyone yet while they do so
---
Dont forget the raid frames, that aint vanilla frames
---
That's disappointing. I was looking forward to it!
---
Queue times for the lulz!
---
on private servers....well no shit.
---
If anything bliz are going to come down hard on them on the run up to their classic release
---
Hi, /u/alfatems
---
I don't think they'll make Classic "extended".
---
BC-classic is very much a possibility.
---
If classic does very well you'll see many classic features make a comeback in the next retail expac IMO.
---
Ehh, whatever. Thousands of people die every single day, can't burn a candle for all of them.
---
Happened to me. I was leveling up my mage twink (around 43) and some rogue decided to gank me. I got mad and logged into my main to get him. He killed my main twice. Yeah what did i expect with a lvl 60 resto druid against a pvp rogue 😂
---
/camp logs you out, when you log back in, you'll be exactly where you were in the instance.
---
So even though this is a vanilla feature, is this something you actually want in classic? It feels to me like this wasn’t particularly well know but no one wants to be in a Bg where half the group are just there for a port.
---
I think he meant gameplay wise, how is rogue able to solo bosses as a melee and wanted an explanation. I only did rogue pvp twinks, so I'm probably wrong, but I'm assuming it has something to do with the old school enchants?
---
You must have picked a server that wasn't popular. I pickef Arthas and because it was the "first" (listed at the top) pvp server, leveling was exactly like the stress test where there with 500 people in each zone lol. It thinned out as you level up because people have lives or quit though.
---
This is no true its really dependant on the degree.
---
Like every single one you can do? Wow classic is hard in leveling. You'll want to do every single quest in all the areas you go to.

Bad link, post removed.
---
I mained a rogue during vanilla and never managed it. I wasn’t in a hardcore guild but we were serious and raided the T1 and T2 raids every week. You’ll need to be in a guild that takes raiding seriously and comes out of the gate running from launch. Turn up every week and be on time. Have your gear up to date and fully enchanted. Bring enough consumables and don’t slack. 
---
You’ll have two full phases of raiding only MC and Onyxia. You should be able to secure the legs and head in that time. You’ll then have two phases of BWL during which, you should certainly be able to get the bracers and belt and probably the boots and gloves. The shoulders and chest will depend on how hard your guild has been pushing and how long the phases are. After that, you’re into AQ40 and then Naxx and you might find your guild just doesn’t have time for BWL any more. 
---
A word of caution though. Don’t hoard your DKP for the T2 pieces. You’ll need to get the weapons and accessories too and not all of the T2 pieces are BIS either. If you fall behind the curve because you’re hoarding DKP for vanity pieces, you may find yourself not being invited to raids at all. It’s a nice goal to have and worth working towards but it’s not as important as being there for your guild’s first C’Thun kill.
---
Multiboxer detected
---
Nothing in phase 1 has anything to do with phase 2. Phase 2 is the same thing every time barring broadsides getting delayed for a first seconds here and there.
---
a fraction can be 3/10 or 9/10, still a fraction but how can you argue with the fact that reusing old assets is cheaper than creating new ones?
---
Yes it will. I have a much worse laptop from 2011 and it can run the game at 60 FPS at the lowest settings.
---
Prot is overkill early on.
---
Never had a syllabys day let alone week in college we always just hop right into notes on the first day.
---
Yea you can run wow on a 600$ laptop. Should be able to put setting at their max if I'm not mistaken.
---
Also if u grp up with some1 right before doing the command /camp?
---
Poll number 101291481249129420120912 on this subject.

---
Skull of Impending Doom
---
I agree with this guy. Don't be wasteful, make sure to always empty out your bags as much as possible so you can pick up absolutely everything that drops, and you'll hit 100g around level 40 without much trouble.
---
You're hilarious...You realize there are Vanilla databases with accurate information still available right? I took the time to research before I answered your question, you just don't like the answer.
---
You are going to struggle to power level yourself through dungeons until your main has very very good gear, and a lot depends on your class choice...This is irrefutable...The time it takes to gear up your main and rush your other account is most likely NOT worth the effort over simply joining a guild and running it with them.
---
the beta is only till lv30 kind of really hard to test stuff like that when nothing lives long enough.
---
Bigwigs tracker breaks because of the randomness of P1 Mythic jaina idiots replying who never played the fight
---
Then show me this database with enemy health numbers?
---
Tut tut!
---
Yep, you'll still log back in at the exact place you were at. We tested this extensively in Blackfathom Deeps. If there's another player inside the instance, you show up wherever you /camp. If you're the only player inside the instance, you show up wherever you /camp.
---
Why are you all riding unicycles instead of playing wow?
---
Nah that was cross realm dungeon finder.
---
Haven't they been doing that for years now?
---
Wasn't aware, could you kindly link me to a similar poll that's filled in properly?
---
Can you duel inside IF in classic or did that come a little later? I remember you could around 2007/8

---
How would you guys implement flying mounts if you absolutely HAD to have them in an MMO?
---
Perhaps make them fly up only to certain heights? Have them have a form of stamina and become forced to land after a certain amount of time? Have them have some combat capabilities?
---
I mean I don't think a single thing killed interaction in wow, there were probably a lot of factors to it and I think flying, sharding, lfg etc all were a part of it.
---
I forget if it told you in Vanilla, but always choose the quest reward option that sells for more (if you don't need any of them obviously). It's nearly always the heaviest armor piece, or a weapon.
---
Yes I have not played the fight since I quit bfa pretty early on. Doesnt make me an idiot tho.
---
So, blizz has 1 out of 20ish bosses that does what i am looking for. Cool, but not enough to keep me hooked or change my mind that MOST bossfights are dance dance revolution
---
Raid frames in classic are the modern ones.
---
Absolutely not true. There are plenty of quests that are not worth the time investment where grinding for that amount of time would be more beneficial.
---
Also quests that require you to pick an item off the ground (that one from dwarf starting zone where you have to get the guy's tools) where it just isn't worth it if there's more than one person doing it due to the long respawn on the items.
---
Balance was poorly balanced
---
Yep, it makes a really good interaction stream for streamers that interact heavily with their communities.
---
WoW Classic if streamed actively by those that have more controlled and respectful streams will do well, whereas those with faster chats might find it struggles as people drop off due to the game being less visually active.
---
Have fun in BFA then bud
---
Okay nice for the replys mate. I would like if u could test one thing for me, that I think u have not tested yet.
---
Go inside rfc, kill 1-2 mobs. Dont grp up with anyone, u have to solo it. When you have killed them, invite some1 to u grp, and when they have accepted. Then press /camp and let it log out. When you log back in, you should be in front of rfc with an reset instance. Can u test it for me?
---
That’s fine don’t worry about it. These people do not belong in classic.
---
it's hard and you will have to grind a level if you don't get skinning in my experience. Skinning gives you lots of gold and incentivises you to grind beats that drop good greys
---
Dude you realize we used an addon called MobHealth3 back in Vanilla right? It was a community driven addon that collected damage numbers from everyone and gave us the average health values of monsters...This is how we figured out the health of mobs back then.
---
VanillaWoWDB uses it's information and gives accurate numbers for most mobs in the game. Plus after you asked about this I went back and watched videos from vanilla for fun, and it's pretty much exactly how I remembered it.
---
Mobs have a lot of health, and we don't have a lot of DPS.
---
Assuming topping charts is your only goal.
---
I mean specific ones man for item rewards

Doesn’t matter what you think looks better, if it was in vanilla, it should be in classic.
---
if you played since late vanilla you should know the answer already
---
Of course it isn’t true. Wish people would just answer my question and stop telling me how to play Vanilla when I’ve done so the last 3-4 years on private servers and leveled multiple 60s.
---
Putting graphics in the same category as animations is the mistake you are making here. Animations are actually part of gameplay, the graphics are only a visual aspect and do not affect gameplay.
---
I have been thinking about it as well. But since you can very easily tank 1-59 dungeons and (questionably even 60lvl dungeons) as fury/arms with shield on, protection at the end of the day doesnt bring anything positive to leveling table, only making it slower. If you want to stick to 1h+shield, I would still choose other talent tree, that will boost your dps
---
Super interesting thanks , do you have a discord for optimizing
---
Still banging out dark souls 3, that’s been scratching my pvp itch for a while now
---
Sorry, but I can't. To my way of thinking, affliction is the only "true warlock". To me, demonology feels like a wanna be hunter and instead of doing that I'd rather play an actual hunter. And destruction feels like a wanna be mage, and instead of that, I'd rather play an actual mage. The biggest disadvantage of affliction is lousy burst damage which sucks for PvP.

And the person cant go inside the instance with u
---
Truthfully there are very few skills you're actually using in each of the forms. As restoration you'll just switch between humanoid to heal and bear for the bonus armor and feral charge, bash, and bear self-heal (forget the name); cat for the stealth and sprint.
---
It will be very obvious when shifting is a good idea. A few examples: "I'm getting mauled with physical damage/there's a rogue sneaking nearby: change to bear form..." "They're ignoring me/I need a quick heal: change to humanoid..." "I need to break this root and get away, change to travel..." "I need to interrupt that spell: change to bear." You get the idea. In fights where you're properly in the back line and being protected you won't shift at all, and when you do need to shift you'll be spoiled by the ability. They're pretty much "I-win" buttons against a whole bunch of effects most classes just suffer through. Think of it as a privilege :)
---
Of couse, in fact, imho vanilla is more casual friendly than retail. Of course, you won't be the best geared char on your server, and probably not inside the best 1000 geared people on the server, but who cares? You can still raid in pugs, you can still level alts and pvp twinks, etc. you just will be much slower than the guys at the front.
---
&gt;I think doing what half the playerbase is capable of doing is not skillful.
---
Again, it's not something more than a tiny percentage of people are capable of. I already proved you wrong, why do you repeat the same false argument? It's not something half the playerbase is capable of, if only 1 person per week can get rank 14. The best person per week, lol.
---
&gt;The people who grind the most honor get the title. Not the most skilled player.
---
These are the same thing, only the most skilled players are capable of grinding the largest amount of honor serverwide, as it requires a very efficient time spent to kills ratio.
---
Thanks. Starting school at launch. Needed a laptop so it should atleast let me play classic t launch
---
Everything up to AQ is possible. BWL might be rough but should clear in time with gear. But AQ/Naxx is when the game expects the raid to start stacking resist/pots/comps.
---
Where do I say that?
---
As people are saying, it's working perfectly, and to add to this, it doesn't stretch the screen as much as most games do on these monitors, at least not on my LG 34UC79G-B .
---
So you prefer to stand still and press 2 buttons the entire time. Theres no challenge in Vanilla raiding and the earlier people realize this the playerbase will drop because theres's no real end game goal and any relevent PvP goals are too much of a grindfest for the target playerbase to accomplish.

They absolutely monitor this place.
---
Of course man. Just expect and accept that you’ll be behind the hardcore players but it’s all about having fun and that’s all that matters. There’s plenty of ways to play an mmo like Classic WoW. I never even reached lvl 60 in vanilla and I had the most fun ever!
---
I think the main reasons its remembered so well are the iconic bosses/locations, and (moreso) the population was at its peak. Wow was so full, it felt alive and bustling, and that transfers a lot of meaning into all activities
---
Yeah, we tried the old way of resetting instances and getting back to the door too. Didn't do it in RFC, but that doesn't matter.
---
Destiny 2 has a new raid in a week.
---
I completely agree on the shitty design for gear...    
---
The last expansion was all about class fantasy and... then they just get rid of everything and make everyone look the same?    
---
I don't get it... the only reason I can think of why they did it is to save time and resource which is absurd.
---
Inviting you has no benefits compared to someone with a massive viewer base.
---
Harsh truth, but you don't really matter.
---
I just wanna be a paladin so i can sing "here comes the heals, please tell me how they feel. I cast my holy light, or bless you with some might."

Blizzard HATES him.
---
Si. Fly.
---
Worse than WoD really?    
---
I don't think BFA is great but I still think WoD is the worst expansion.  
---
The leveling, the zones, the garrisons... everything was just boring.
---
&gt;And you only get 5 instances per hour (for all dungeons combined).
---
Did you actually test this? I heard that 5 instances per hour cap was not in the beta.
---
Late reply but I also suggest considering a widescreen monitor. I always find having that extra screen space in mmo's quite nice. Can have your chat windows etc off to the side and have a nice clear area in the middle.
---
So the thing where u are the ONLY ONE inside the instance, and u have cleared something. And your mate is outside of the instance, and u grp up with him, and he stays outside when u press /camp. U still end up at the same place, with no reset?
---
Both, but Alliance as my main faction so I voted for that one.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7727
---
Oh no you've been rend/wounded/whatever. You can't stealth! Whatever shall you do?

Can't confirm 100% that this is still the issue on classic beta (but It was a problem on blizzcon build), as shown on this 1.13 sandbox:

---
How many hours a day/week (excluding weekends) do you think you'll play? Bottom line it. I bet it's still enough to be considered "hardcore". The only thing that really required enormous amounts of playtime was PVP ranking. Raiding on Pservers is like 3hrs a week.
---
Also, they'll be a LFG addon. We're hoping by launch, but only one of us has beta access, so it's difficult to test. You'll be able to level those alts while you wait in queue for a dungeon on your "main".
---
It won't struggle even just a little bit, lol.
---
I think this was always changeable in settings but maybe not.
---
Can I give custom names to guild ranks in Classic?
---
That's the neckbeardiest thing I ever read. If he's not making cringey attempts to hit on the girls he's calling them whores.
---
Thats, like, your opinion, dude. 
---
Never claimed vanilla was challenging. Just said what I dislike about current raiding.
---
But, I am glad that you enjoy it and I hope you can enjoy it for a long time.
---
Go warlock :)
---
Honestly man do yourself a favor and roll as arms. You get talents that let you stance dance which makes life so much better and you can easily tank all dungeons to 60 as arms.
---
If you want to play sword and shield go for it, but be prepared for a long trip with a fair amount of downtime unless you have a healer on your trip to 60.
---
I have a cheap laptop as well, about 5 or 6 years old and it was 500-600 dollars. Wondering whether to stick with it, I'm sure classic will run fine, it's an old game...or do I buy a better laptop for it?
---
Damn. that sucks. I guess it's something they won't leave in this version of classic lol
---
I remember seeing this and trying it. It was as fun as it looked.
---
My favorite part about pvp servers is controlling contested zones. I honestly think huge pvp battles are a bit overrated. I know I'll take a long detour in Ashenvale at 29... Holding down Maestra's Post and stopping horde from using the road... Bringing the fight to Zoram strand and pushing them back into their camp. It's a war out there boys.
---
&gt;retail WoW is harder in every other facet of the game than classic is.
---
It can be if you select the highest difficulties. But that is my point... Too easy suddenly becomes too hard. Being a casual you don't have the time needed to overcome the too hard part, all that is left is the too easy.
---
Since casual is relative: When I think casual, I think someone that plays sporadically. The total amount of hours, while low, is not so important in my definition as is the ability of setting aside specific hours of the week. If someone plays from 8 to 10 pm 4 times every week, that person doesn't play casually, but religiously.
---
&gt; Can I give custom names to guild ranks in Classic?
---
General advise will be to level as fury initially, switch to mortal strike once possible and then respecc only at 60 into prot. That being said, WoW is about "your journey". Therefore if you want to level as protection, go for it. You'll be able to decide for yourself if it's something you wanna do or not.
---
Yes. I soloed the first boss of SM Graveyard with no group, invited a friend (he was in Stormwind), /camped, and logged back in at the exact same place. It was the same for a regular logout and an intentional disconnect by turning off my Ethernet.
---
What classes could potentially solo BRD Emperor?
---
I've seen it done on a well-geared Rogue. I'm assuming a Hunter could pull it off too. How about Druid, Warlock or Shaman?
---
I'm talking absolute try-hard mode; consumables, specific trinkets, the whole shebang.
---
Thanks in advance, love ya reddit &lt;3
---
Oh :(
---
Main quest for SM and RFD reward nice swords.
---
Back around the time of nost going down I had a very shitty laptop way way worse than this and I was able to play classic at 60 on low settings. This game is meant to be played on 2004 hardware so just look at it like that.
---
If they ever happen to create TBC realms, they should definitely do it with no flying and then fix the quests that required flying.
---
pls go away with your LFG Addon. There is world chat and that's enough.
---
Yeah you can do it of course. It will be slow but if you want to build RPG lore on your own character as a protection warrior go for it :)
---
I think my favorite experiences are when your faction is getting killed by groups of the opposing faction so you rile everyone up in general chat and get and impromptu raid going. Making sure the horde couldn't use a road or clearing some gankers always felt like you won a victory for your faction in contested zones. Makes it feel like a war zone.

They do though. I always enjoyed playing against ret paladins, they pose zero threats.

Always good times with Seti haha. I assume you meant Rambow, the dwarf hunter?

wow if thats working its a game changer..
---
10-12h per week, weekends could be a lot of time or none 😂
---
Yeah, somehow I had "Classic" in my head and not "Originally" my bad.
---
Just wondering who has the highest DPS in 1.12? Anyone have a quick Tier list or link?
---
Damn, that is not how it should be on the beta. You cant rly farm mara or dire maul then :/ They need to fix that!
---
Yeah jusf make sure to take care of yourself and your personal life because wow will ruin it if you let it. But it would be better to start classic than retail because it is imo a better game. If you went from retail to classoc it may seem much slower paced which turns some people off.
---
Rogue was my OG character for vanilla and I loved it but this time I’ll be going rogue as my alt and Druid as main. I fell in love with healing during TBC
---
God save the queen
---
Looks pretty completed, well you will have to spend enough time to farm them all 😂
---
You'll have enough at lvl 40-45 if you don't buy anything, and don't learn all the (useless) spells at the trainer. Cooking is also very good to make money at low levels.
---
Can druids level that well with healing gear/spec? I didn’t play Druid in vanilla and only during TBC onwards.
---
Luckily I love healing so.. win win!
---
What is the core gameplay in your opinion? To me the core gameplay of retail is high-difficulty raiding; and that is the thing... Everything else (but PvP) is neglected, becoming meaningless.
---
Engineering is a must in in pvp. And also in pve if you want to minmax your characters. If you want to minmax forget about those guides that suggest tailoring and enchanting
---
just stop learning ur useless miscallenous spells and you'll be just fine for the mount by level 40 without any special effort put into farming gold specifically
---
Can't have 3 consecutive letters in a name.
---
Mine was a crappy Dell, I remember I had a solid 512mb of ram haha. I’d never enter Dalaran, Shattrath, any of the major zones everyone hung out in. I only kept spell texture at Ultra for raiding, still got a solid 10-15 FPS also haha. 
---
The hard drive ended up getting fucked and I didn’t know any better at the time so I convinced my mom to go to geek squad to see what they’d say. Told me they couldn’t recover it :(
---
Did he drop any good loot?
---
I'm not a mage but I'm 99$ sure its once per spell. Except channeling spells have a chance every tick.
---
If I roll warrior or warlock instead of mage I'm doing this and having a mage alt that I'll level once I have pre raid bis. To farm and port myself around.  It's just $15 a month.
---
I could be misremembering but I could swear there were holiday mounts too.
---
The first animation is a lot better even though the "realism" isn't on point, it still is a better animation. Hope they will revert it before launch.
---
Yes in stress test I tried some things about rep. A quest that was supposed to give 250 rep according to pserver, was giving 100 rep. 
---
Also I started as night elf. Quests on my starting zone only gave me Darnassus rep, no spillover. But when I went to Stromwind and did a quest there (the one you got a bottle of wine), it gave me 75 Darnassus rep an 18 rep spillover on all the other factions.
---
I have memories of leveling up a female dwarf paladin (Esk &lt;3) in vanilla before TBC came out and was exalted on all reps at 40 and bought all the mounts. I just did the leveling trying to do all quests on all zones meanwhile they were "green" just 1 level before turning "gray". So I think it will be doable in classic too (I think I will do it again on my Alt, on my main I want just to level chilling and go with the flow :)).
---
Bindings dropped off gare and baron ged after BWL was released and eye of sulf dropped off rag.
---
Depends on the raid.
---
But typically warriors are always up there. Rogues mostly in t1-2, and mages start going hard in AQ-naxx. With full BiS warlocks can get up there too.
---
Or play lock or pally!
---
You no take candle!
---
We dont need a lfg addon thats kinda against the point of classic.
---
I don't remember this at all
---
If you don't waste money on useless shit like gear, respec and bad abilities, and you grind a bit of good gold mobs at some point from 30-40, you should do fine.
---
If you couldn't tell.. that last line was sarcasm.
---
Those are items that just transform your mount temporarily
---
So i could play current wow too then?
---
My first toon was a Druid I made back in 2005. He was shelved since BC But I'll be hitting Legion with him. His clocked 89 days of play time on him and last night he dinged 100. I though of this song as took a moment to reflect. Good times.
---
OMG the hype is real
---
Yes. The "You have entered too many instances recently" happens at 5 per hour, which is how it should be, as [that was added before patch 1.7 during a weekly maintenance](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-general/4568259.htm).
---
Omg the mount doesn't tilt back, omg it breaks my immersion. Seriously ppl  bitch about every single thing there is. You won't even look at the flight cause you'll either be afk or watching 2nd screen/alt tabbed.
---
&gt; So i could play current wow too then?
---
Up until level 110, yes.     
---
For anything beyond Legion content you'd have to buy BfA though.
---
Yeah, and really well. I'm playing the beta now without a gpu at 140fps @1080p with graphic setting 3. Looks good and plays really good
---
I took two weeks off as well. Mainly because it was nearly the only time of the year left to actually take some days off. So I got kinda lucky.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview)
---
Brewfest Ram was BC, Big Love Rocket was Wotlk and it seems like the same applies to the other Mounts, they all have been added after Classic.
---
In premades or wpvp, assuming you do not quedodge like people did on nost etc but play vs good people as well, the role of a priest (especially horde side, they always bring 3 discs) is dispel/offensive dispel/shield utility etc.
---
All those things a disc/holy does better than a shadow (more mana, better healing power and talents) whilst they are still able to assist with a mindblast or whatever.
---
What does a shadowpriest provide? Decent damage, godlike 1v1 potential.
---
Do you 1v1 in a wsg? Not even once.
---
Is your class desirable if you have to drink after your general rotation? No.
---
It's an inferior warlock or mage, it's the same as retpala.
---
Some trash tier players who will never play at the top 0.1% will try to delude themselves in saying "but he can bring utility!!".
---
Stupid mindset to have, the utility you bring is vastly inferior to the real deal and you cannot do your intended job as well so you are a waste of a dps slot or a heal slot, everything damage related is worse to dps classes (cc etc as well, much worse) and everything support related worse than priests who are holy, ergo you take 1dps and 1 disc/holy.
---
SP works in duels and in the 1v1 world encounter but you are oom afterwards. It's a one trick pony, probably bottom 3 in all of vanilla specs (druid as a class is still worse than shadow tho).
---
The shadow tree has some good stuff, silence and mind flay (slow), but you can just have a healing priest spec down to silence that is not unheard of.
---
Let's not talk about PvE either where a heal priest with shadow weaving using r1 mind blasts is better than the shadowpriest "dps".
---
I remember always going to the realm forum first, actually 90% of my forum time was in the specific realm forum, the other 10% on realmpool forums.
---
So you'll reach 60 in about 2-3 months and then have plenty of time to raid. MC clears on PServers (with MC/BWL gear only) take about 30 minutes, definitely not longer than an hour.
---
Played a Resto/Boomkin From Trials of Crusader through til Blackrock Foundry, very fun to play
---
Aww RIP Brewfest Ram.
---
*Ganks lowbies then posts a video with music that makes me want kill myself trying to act like their cool* you have the opportunity to get a life but i doubt you will take it.
---
What do the numbers next to the mounts mean?
---
I like when the warrior tries to help and then gets hit for 1600 and goes “nope”
---
What Tigole and Furor did to Paladins on Classic is god-awful, too. WotLK Pallies are the best.
---
yeah r14 on nost when everyone quedodged each other and the almost no top premades existed skill wise, the meta has since developed a lot.
---
Ret is laughable in performance but go on and play with one in classic and be farmed by the nolife 0.1% premades because it's a burden to any team.
---
No one cares if you can farm a chinese premade with no gear or some solo Q players.
---
&gt;Both
---
not on pvp server you wont.
---
How dare someone enjoy ganking lets assume he dosnt have a life and insult him because we dont enjoy his video
---
I have no idea what you're talking about...
---
Ill do the ones for Warlock only. There is a bunch of combinations considerd good for Warlocks, but this is a choice up to you, what do you intend and what will help your playstyle more.   
---
**Tailoring/Engineering** \- **Tailoring** for an epic robe at 60, then later on when ZG is out you can make 3 more epic gear bis. **Engineering** is a must have to PVP  
---
**Tailoring/Herbing** \- **Herbing**, so you can herb flowes to make potions for PVE and PVP  
---
**Tailoring/Enchanting** \- This is a good combo because **Tailoring** helps **Enchanting**, but it is expensive. And the best selling highend enchants are from raids or very rare drops.  
---
**Tailoring** is good because it created best in slot items 2 times. 1. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=14153](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14153) Prebis - all the way until BWL or ZG. 2.   [https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421)  These will last you until Naxx. So as a warlock you want **Tailoring.**  
---
Your Second proffesion are up to your playstyle. Personally i like **Engineering**. Its fun and its Mandatory in pvp.
---
I don't plan to have my mains on a PVP server anyway.
---
Outlaw Sabre (http://classicdb.ch/?item=16886) from BRD is an insane main hand at the early '20s, definitely a must have IMO.
---
Use it or don't, we don't really care. But as long as two people on the same faction and server are using it, they'll have an advantage.
---
wasn't there a quest with a car and a dirt track ? that was neat
---
Outlaw Sabre (http://classicdb.ch/?item=16886) from BFD is an insane main hand at the early '20s, definitely, a must have IMO.
---
On horde rogues and warriors will always be the top dps. In later endgame (aq/naxx) you will see some warlocks creep up and usually one mage (because of how ignite works) really high.
---
Instance farm and /camp does not work as it should.
---
So from my understanding, it is Blizzard’s intention to keep the old farming methods intact (Dire Maul E/N/) and Mara etc. 
---
Propper behavior as far as I know is as follows:
---
1. Farming run done (Alone ofc).
---
2. Player invite some1 to grp
---
3. Player /camp and wait for logout (or use another command)
---
4. Player logs back in, should appear at the start of the instance with it reset.
---
Does not work.
---
When inside rfc, solo 1-2 mobs, invites some1 to grp, press /camp, its logging out, but when looging back in, no reset, and u are at the same place inside the instance.
---
1-2 Weeks would be my guess that in the strating areas things slow down a but and you can comfortably start your own levelling :)
---
Ganking lowbies is a completly doffrent thing from ganking someone of equal level. Ones a fair fight the other is like shooting fish in a barrel. So i can assume you dont confidence in your pvp abilities or have a life. Plus that song is really fucking with my hangover.
---
You can do, but none of your talents give you more shadow damage, so you mostly rely on fire spells. Searing pain does quite good dps in this spec and the immolate conflag combo is very dangerous. 
---
Also improved shadowbolt only increases your damage after a crit, so it's quite unreliable in PvP and would require multiple shadowbolt hits which rarely happen in PvP even with its relatively fast cast speed. He does spend points into Pyroclasm which gives you a pretty good chance at stunning with your soulfire opener. I wouldn't doubt the guy himself but I would maybe spend those points into Aftermath instead since it affects all destruction spells.
---
Kids.
---
why shouldn't you be able to farm then? It just takes longer, because you have to run back. /camp was definitely not intended by Blizzard in vanilla, so it's a good thing they fixed that.
---
Was the Zhevra RAF mount in Classic?
---
You'll need an addon to see vendor prices in classic. Generally weapons will always sell for more, especially 2h.
---
Right with you dude. This situation now is perfect: they can fuck off to their slot machine retail wow and stop polluting classic.
---
They are not, especially not in the gear department.
---
Ret cannot even really win duels except vs a bad rogue as reckoning spec.
---
You are in for a huge disappointment if you seriously believe ret is viable (farming honor as a premade via quedodging does not make ret viable, neither is farming solo teams as a premade).
---
Ret has no utility holy does not have, it does not have the holy benefit of pseudo cc immunity (blessing of sacrifice on range on a tanky healer, ret is front line and just dies lol) no MS effects and shitty healing/dispel/buffs due to bad manapool.
---
Their damage is also crap except the 1 in 1000 proc crit, holy pala can burst just as good, reliably, once they have t2 quality gear (a bit weaker I guess but it's consistent plus more upsides to it) and they are actually not in the way of the team or have to use freedom on themselves to autoattack people.
---
Don't buy into the meme that ret works in pvp or you will be really sad.
---

not a good thing. it was there in vanilla, and it has to be fixed. we cant grind gold propper now
---
This man levels. So much better... Just avoid that shit fucking cave
---
Im pretty sure they said they will ban these kinds of addons and maybe evem the people using them.
---
Dude yes, agreed. Loved wrath, it had all that and great pvp 2, but I genuinely hope classic never goes there
---
The 2019 experience for ret paladins is never being able to attack because you are kited with no movement abilities, and any premade would kick you for life, and guild kick, if you do not use freedoms on warriors or flag carriers.
---
Aye charity epics dilute the experience not just for the hardcore but for everyone
---
Ah.. the manual that mages used to claim they were superiour DPS and warlocks had to be nerfed because of that :D
---
Lame that Blizzard doesn't want to have non-armor epic mounts out, yeah they said they didn't want people to rush 60 but they could have left them in the game for like 3 months, which should be more than enough time for most people to not rush 60 and still obtain them.

I was 10 when I started playing a couple months after EU release. I wasn't allowed to have my own acc, but then my dad finally agreed to start paying for my own account since I was disconnecting him all the time.
---
Got carried through Onyxia/MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 by my dad's guild but wasn't allowed to come to AQ40 and Naxx :)
---
I only ever leveled to 40 on my own.
---
I honestly feel like they should and will just add tbc a wotlk while keeping past versions available to play. Also adding league mechanic to the previous expanisons.
---
Not quite. They said "we MAY be restricting some of those new things as well" when talking about the API functionality in relation to addons that disrupt the vanilla social experience by being able to communicate together. [Source](https://youtu.be/wS1juqaiW3o?t=2542).
---
Except our addon only uses API calls that the major "must have" addons use, so if they're gonna break ours, they'll be breaking just about everything.
---
Nope, added in BC.
---
Layering is meant to be server-wide, it can't affect only certain zones. In this sense, it's worse than sharding.
---
It's an offtopic here.

You're lucky then.
---
I have fond memories of groups that would include a shaman, but said shaman would say things like 'i dont heal'. 
---
"You're the only one in the group with a healing spell?"
---
"I don't heal"
---
Off by 3 days. Damn close friend. Damn close.

I’m not sure on the reasoning, but schools in the U.K usually start after the first week of September. University starts two/three weeks in, as there is welcome weeks and people moving into halls.
---
Vanilla WoW was the reason I spent 7 years in school and walked away with a 2 year degree that I don't use and more student loan debt than my mortgage. 
---
ENJOY!
---
Haha I remember a private server that started it all having the same bug on its Beta :D
---
Not sure if this was a thing in Vanilla, but it's been a thing on retail and pservers for a loong time.
---
flight paths used to do this in vanilla, I remember it vividly, even the wyverns would tilt around corners n shit, was really cool.
---
Then all of a sudden, around cata i believe? the flight paths just went in a weird straight line with awkward turning... 
---
I hope we get the tokyo drift flight paths again

"Send me BACK!"

We will see

Legion post s3 was a great time for pvp 2, it’s scaling made gear a very small factor and established an actually competitive environment as a result. Every class had atleast 1 glad viable spec as well and I found most of them fun (i did 2-2.5k with 7 characters - the elite sets were awesome). I do hope classic gets arenas at some point but in that case I hope they just completely template us while in there (or otherwise stop pretending it’s a competitive esport - you can’t have both. If CS started giving +gun dmg to you the more you played it would break down so fast)
---
**What happen to your old friends, did they all die?**
---
It's a combination of everything that they added that killed the community and thus the game.  LFG is shit because it removes reasons to congregate in cities and around other players in general.
---
Hah oh lord
---
Plot twist: it’s a legit project
---
1) Consistently on time.
---
2) Prepared with consumables, ESPECIALLY ON FARM STATUS RAIDS.
---
3) Not playing a meme spec.
---
Especially point 2 and 3, once ZG hits there is a ridiculous amount of content to be done WEEKLY to prepare for AQ.
---
Your guild will have to raid MC weekly for gear and bindings (sulfuras sucks anyway no one cares), onyxia, ZG and BWL. That's quite a lot.
---
Do you think people enjoy spending 4-5hours in MC because some people want to play le epic ret pal? Spend so much time because people are too lazy to farm consumables? This affects morality, one of the most common guild killers.
---
You also need to split your raid in half, give or take, for ZG and later on 20-25man molten core even.
---
For mage in particular, have dark runes potions elixirs and even flasks. Have proper gear, know how to farm gold efficiently to fund your raiding and in a really good guild where a lot of good players exist be willing to spend a week worth of gold to fund consumables for someone else as well (IRL problems, assuming said person is usually on time and prepared as well it's a good thing to have each others back).
---
When I played on private, I played a mage and bought ALL the spells up until 40, re-specced 4 times, had enchanting and tailoring (so most gear went into money sinking) and constantly repaired due to how much I was dieing. Still managed to get the mount by 42. My warrior friend got it by 45.
---
I went mining on my last private server and sold bars to the vendor after smelting them. I’d send stacks of ore to an alt then when I was going to stop for a while I’d mail them back and afk making bars. I don’t know how it compares to skinning, but I made a fair bit from it

---
I played a paladin, i think i was like 10 years old. I did 0 quests until lvl 40 i also had no clue what talents was so i had 0 talents...i also saved gold because i tought as a paladin i had to buy mount. Then one day i stumbled upon another paladin and when he used Seal of command and i asked him what that cool attack was and he told me how to get talents. At lvl 60 i healed ZG with full ret spec/gear and had no clue what i was doing. Raidleader told me to just heal stuff. lmao
---
If I can judge by the amount of streamers saying mages are op were going to see a ton of mages...
---
Nope, ghost wolf arent allowed either.
---
Not only that but who the fuck wants to give a ret paladin gear when you can give it to a warrior.
---
Oh neat. Since I'm gonna level a priest this time I know what I'm gonna do when I reach lvl 60 :D
---
You're full of it
---
Can't decide between:
---
Priest - I wanna heal in PvE, melt faces in PvP as shadow
---
Warlock - Godly in both PvP and PvE
---
Hunter - Deadzone scares me but seems great overall
---
Druid - Played since vanilla, got the muscle memory down already
---
My classes end August 13! Gotta do exam prep tho, but at least no classes.

This is a camera follow setting, you can turn it of to never.

Imho it was like this in vanilla. Probably due to spellbatching

SW didn’t have an AH back in the day.

That's not the reason they killed World pvp.it died because it didn't matter if you even flew into each other... You couldn't start a fight mid air.

I knew what both of these were before clicking xD  +1
---
I’m feared! I’m weak 😂
---
Will I have to create an account when the game comes out or do people use their BFA accounts?
---
I know this is the case. I think the problem is that these addons can be massively improvent in classic, and the availability/awareness is much higher compared to fifteen years ago. I am not sure how more mature players played vanilla, but personally I was not aware of any addons that could "exploit" these kind of things in Vanilla.
---
Hello folks, I was wondering if skinning/leatherworking is a good idea for a healer shaman? I saw a lot of people reccomending alchemy but I very much like the idea of creating my own equipment, also when leveling a shaman, should I put talents in restoration if I plan to heal a lot of dungeons when leveling or should I pick enhancement and respec at 60?
---
Between shadow form’s damage reduction, shields and inner fire, shadow priests were very tanky in vanilla. Shadow word pain does a ton of damage if left un-dispelled/healed.
---
From my understanding, shadow priest is not highly desired in organised pvp. They run out of mana quickly and the benefit of one over a mage/lock may be low. On horde, without paladins, you’ll find a lot more luck as disc or holy
---
Is there a maximum number of ranks in a guild? If so, what is the max?
---
Can use your BFA account. Just need to have a subscription.
---
Ah yeah you're right. Was a cata thing, for some reason I thought it was in wayy earlier
---
Probably not. Druids tend to level in feral spec.
---
If you already have an account (old one or for BfA) that'll work.     
---
If you don't, then a new one will do fine too.
---
You should go to MIT and tell them that you can prove the first law of Thermodynamics wrong, because I'm pretty sure pressing keyboards doesn't GENERATE calories and make you fat.

Mizkif is lvl12 priesting.

Yeah, only thing I could find is [this](https://www.wowhead.com/item=21212/fresh-holly) which transforms your mount, but that's about it.

Sucks to suck
---
okay buddy
---
When i leveled a hunter i ran all the way from dun morogh to darnassus at level 10 to tame a white owl pet at level 10.  totally worth it though since its (imo) by far the best pet for leveling all the way to 60  if you pick up pet skills for it along the way.  
---
and white owls arent seen untill winterspring after that if i remember right
---
It had to do with age and just general knowledge on gaming. We know a lot more today that helps us (key binds and everything) along with having infinite information online. Combine that with young kids and yeah, I'm not surprised most people sucked.
---
I was 10 in Vanilla
---
&gt; Yes MC is pretty silly to not do it since it can put a huge difference into how fast you clear.
---
It takes more time to farm the gold for the consumes you use in an MC farm run than you save while doing said MC.
---
I was 16 when I started in Feb of 05. It was the first mmo I had ever played so that probly played a large role in me sucking for a majority of it. Still one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.
---
Meanwhile healers be like Oh! :D
---
I'd say that Classic is more suited for casuals, than retail. In retail (and many other modern day MMOS) due to dailies/weekly quests and different events on a periodic basis a player has to log in and do repeatable stuff every day or at least 3-4 days per week just not to fall behind other players. It creates a hamster-in-a-wheel feeling and quite exausting, imo; the game turns into filling constant checklists. In Classic there are no dailies and weekly quests, so even if a player doesn't play a week, they can start exactly from the same place they were before. And they'll eventually reach their goal, even if slower, than others. Imo, old games are perfect for middle-aged casuals like myself, hehe.

That's actually an awfully accurate and peculiar comparison. Thank you.
---
In legion (maybe before?) they added an heirloom trinket that gives 50% xp from battlegrounds - you get it with 13 gurubashi wins! My old rogue had 12 from being a twink for a while !! So I had all my arena friends come help me, took a good hour at least, then I got it. The reason I had 8 max lvl toons in legion was entirely due to that trinket, 1 by win was like 60-70% of a level if I had that on. Went on to get more than 7 elite sets. Great expansion for pvp imo, shame beta for ass a lot opted to ignore it
---
Nice poll. You got an upvote from me!
---
You can have both on different servers it’s what I am gonna do
---
.....really
---
If I'm not mistaken the maximum number of ranks for a guild is 10.
---
Except it shows the word is being used incorrectly though?  
---
Not that I care if he is misusing the word or not... but he is.
---
The potential database differences aren't relevant since an official 1.12 client now exists and can be datamined. However, the comments people have left over the years are precious and shouldn't be discarded for no good reason. My whole point was that a new database site is needed, but wowhead is trying to be too many things at once to fulfill that role better than someone else.
---
jesus christ this guy hits as hard as naxx bosses
---
You have to bear in mind, especially given the amount of votes (and how statistics works), that this poll is very accurate but for the *sample population*.
---
And that's where the discrepancy will lie. This poll is the opinions of knowledgeable and/or hardcore players, who browse this sub.
---
Adding together all types of players for real at launch will mean the class spread is quite different.
---
Probably resulting in hunter moving up in popularity, warlock down, rogue up, etc.
---
Layering =/= sharding
---
I would love to be in a guild that could kill vael in 16 seconds every week. Sounds implausible to me.
---
The first one is a ninja, the second one is making  quiet run for the toilet at 4 AM
---
Paladin and maybe druid.
---
It's still his cover. I don't think anyone was arguing that he created the lyrics himself.
---
It's the same as Michael Jackson and Alien Ant Farm with Smooth Criminal.
---
14 maybe.   
---
I remember doing a gnomegran run for the entire day morning to night without finishing it. Had to replace people a few times. Biggest problem was I was tanking as fury in berserk stance with no shield. We did kill a few bosses though which was nice and I think 1-2 people stayed for the entire duration which just showed how patient some people were and I hope we had fun. I did at least.   
---
I use to think it was super hard.   
---
On the brightside the couple of times I did it in lfg a few expansions later I at least new which way to go.
---
I was 5 when I started playing in vanilla. I couldn't read the quests on my own and had to get help from my family almost constantly. So yeah, I definitely sucked at the game
---
Cuz I like twitch and I'm a big fan of these streamers?
---
This is true. You also don’t need to have played vanilla to report a bug. If you see floating objects or mobs moving at speeds more than they should, or not pathing correctly, or if a spell isn’t working as described, etc... all of those can be reported without knowledge of the game. They also did invite a lot of actual vanilla players to get those kinds of bugs reported. Also, the stress test is another useful way for them to find out bugs which a lot of us got into.
---
Yes it is. Check this channel out, [Hardware Numb3rs](https://youtu.be/c5fHtDZehmw). He has some really good benchmark videos for WoW. 
---
Note that this is the BFA client which can use dx12 which optimizes multithreading. I read somewhere that Classic does NOT have this option. Hopefully they'll add it though. If anyone have more info regarding this please update me!
---
Dwarf priest is huge. Human/orc for fury warriors are also huge. Everything else is minimal
---
If I MC a Tauren druid can i make them cast teleport moonglade
---
I believe there are ways to do both. I would much prefer tbc because its my favortie expansion. I dont think new content after naxx should come in the form of a new raid/gear/balance change. This literally goes against the point of classic which is for people to play the game how it was. I believe they should just keep classic servers up and release tbc, have 1.5-2 year league servers for classic nd have insentives to play all expansions. Like maybe a sort of like a very hard quest/achievement that requires all expansions (wrath included) and after finishing you get a tcg mount or something. Also that if you want to do a raid and get cool gear than you cannot run it on a higher level character you must do the raid on the expansion it was meant to be played. 
---
New content worked for osrs because the game was not made in a raid tier fashion. If we made extra raids for classic than it would be a complete shit show because we would have better gear than naxx which is already very powerful. Make the gap of fresh 60 and max geared player too insane escpcially in pvp, this is called power creep i believe.
---
Damn really no non armor mounts ? :( 
---
Back in classic I wanted an armor one. Had the gold already but waited for patch to get the armor mount :/
---
Little I have known what a shit decision it was :/
---
Worst case scenario people will just alt tab out of the game and use a website to LFG.
---
I was 17. I played mmos before WoW too. I did alright, but looking back I made a lot of mistakes too.
---
Even when lvl 60 you don't need to go prot to tank dungeons, and tbh going arms/fury is much more fun and better for lvling. Respec to prot when you hit 60 and have some pre-raid bis.
---
Fair enough. 
---
I  feel that original is worth mentioning as well either way.
---
I got paid 50 bucjs each time you were able to go like twice a week. This is in the us
---
So u should know then, shouldn't u?
---
is this game started over the battle net launcher?
---
The obvious answer is - yes you can get enough gold for more than one token in less10-15m of daily log ins. The thing is... you have to know the market.
---
Maybe they do 1.1 talents then? No, they've said basillion times that everything except content gating will be 1.12.
---
I played on Sen'jin too! I was a kid during classic but I rememember looking up to people in the guilds Grey Council, and Defiance. I have a little dream for classic that Sen'jin players all join the same server. I was in a casual guild called &lt;Cowboys From Hell&gt; in late vanilla/early tbc. Eventually lost touch with thise guys around wotlk times. Would love to get back together
---
My memories are so faded but one player I remember from TBC and maybe classic was Palar. Best enchanter on the server. I hope he comes back and can enchant me
---
I'm the type to get burnt out so I'm gonna wait.
---
Very true! :D
---
I don’t know if we even get paid for donating blood in Australia I think we get a cookie, drink and a bandaid. Ive never given blood before however so I could be wrong.
---
&gt; So you will have the same name as in BFA?
---
Account name and/or Battle.net-Tag? Yes.
---
Character names? No. Everyone will have to start from scratch.
---
They are awesome, even with low gear.
---
&gt; is this game started over the battle net launcher?
---
15, almost 16
---
Dont its painfull, go fury or arms and you can still tank as lon as you have a good 1h shield and more tanky gear
---
You will need to create a new character so you will pick a name on creation. Your btag name wont change.
---
Deathcharger's Reins is an epic mount.
---
The TCG Riding Turtle wasn't in Vanilla. None of the TCG items were. The NPC you used to exchange them, Landro Longshot, was added in 2.0.1.
---
Yup, they confirmed that they won't be adding them because otherwise people would be rushing to 60 in order to get them before they get removed again.
---

&gt; We aren't putting back the unarmored mounts. We just talked about this recently internally. We know some people are interested in them, but we don't want to put them in for a limited period of time, because we didn't want to influence people through their first leveling experience. Especially people coming back for the first time. We don't want people to feel like they have to rush. If you want to level slowly and enjoy the journey, you should. That's how I like to play--taking it slow, running every dungeon.
---
One of my best mates decided on Paladin and that was it for all of us. I pray you don't get stuck like we did!
---
What a great story mark
---
Wait unless you care about knowing everything or anything off the bat
---
You could bring up night elves dancing naked on mailboxes, but that might backfire depending on their preferences.
---
I tuned in briefly to staysafe to see him find a spot at the dark portal in blasted lands where there was an invisible wall.     
---
His stream spammed to report it and he didn't notice and died shortly after.      
---
I didn't stay much more after that, for all I know he reported it shortly after.       
---
People forget streaming isn't just sitting here focusing solely on wow. They may have excessive amounts of time to play, but they are there to entertain along with play the game.
---
I think half of the 150k views on this video are from me.
---
OOM in 3... 2... 1...
---
It's only 3 months just wait
---
&gt;The increase will be negligible at higher ranks.
---
Unlike you I am not 60 in the Beta, so I dont know.
---
More non streamer/Influencers were US than any other region comparing both US/EU forums, but that's understandable since its located in the US.
---
Consistency. If you show up and do what they expect of you (bring consumes, have your pre-raid bis or close, listen to what they say) things will be in your favor.
---
True, probably not many that know that it wasn't him that created it.
---
Sounds nice but it's all about the marketing.
---
Look at the game, it appears ready enough to be released today if they wanted. The small bugs that are still present could be patched out during normal maintenance.
---
The game really doesn't need a beta as it's not being built from ground up but more akin to taking a fully functional pre-existing game and porting it onto a new framework.
---
The only mistake Blizzard made was calling it beta, if they had called it the promotional testing period, there wouldn't be nearly the outrage.
---
Lucky you guys, at least you have a good launch time haha
---
I grew up playing WC2 so the expansion to me was amazing. I am not huge into hardcore endgame because of family and obligations but the story and visuals were top notch in my opinion.
---
I was being sarcastic, yeah, I am tired of seeing people push for changes to a game meant as a historical preservation project.
---
"WE SHOULD TOTALLY MAKE THE GAME LIKE BFA BECASUE TRUE CLASIC FANS LIKE MYSELF WANT LFR IN CLASSIC"

Yet you cared enough to reply to the thread. LUL

&gt; Deathcharger's Reins is an epic mount.
---
Wowhead shows it as a blue and so do other vanilla databases, which is why I made it that way, I'll fix it as soon as they do it too just to be sure.
---
Also I didn't know that the Riding Turtle wasn't in Classic, thanks! Someone told me that it was which is why I added it :D
---
Plasma not blood, they put your blood back in you after they take the plasma. They pay you for plasma in the us because its used to make meds so usually these plasma companies pay you a small fraction of what they will make selling it or making meds and selling it. Just look up plasma centers in your area and see if they pay, I wasnt able to find much googleing it myself.
---
Does classic support widescreen so you can use all the space?
---
If they’re serious about raiding, paladins and Fear Ward should swing it. If they’re serious about PVP, you might have a tougher time convincing them.
---
Do you know that classic supports widescreen? If it does, I agree that would be nice. If it doesn't, that would be a waste.
---
&gt; Perhaps make them fly up only to certain heights? 
---
This is not the main problem with flying. The main problem with flying in my opinion is that it kills all interaction. It kills world pvp, it kills all sense of danger in the world. 
---
Its almost like adding fast travel, the journey stops mattering. As another commented above said, as a rogue you get that perk of being able to skip stuff. That makes it "a special" thing of playing rogue that most classes do not get to experience. But with flying this all doesn't matter. Imo no flying at all is the best for the game, there is literally no good way to implement flying for me.
---
Killing. People slowing down the already cancerous vanilla lvling. Results in hilarious whispers thats why i do it
---
Are these league items on your bars? Like ruby crystal, warmogs, randuins omen???
---
Yeah, you couldn't finish quests. People made class raids so there wouldn't be too much hassle over class loot (which was an awful time for rogues and hunters, I can recall there being a huge overpopulation of those).
---
The quest rewards were usually not worth the hassle to 5-man the dungeons, and having an Barov Peasant Caller early on was quite a thing.
---
Aside from the risk of tourists burning out before the game is even out, I think handing streamers Beta keys was a stroke of genius.
---
Marketing + a legion of over-excited backseat bugtesters = win win
---
yeah, and that's to be expected. If I played a fury warr and the raid leader asked me to respec prot to tank, I'd do it without hessitation. That's a sacrifice you'd have to be willing to do being part of a guild, and I've never seen anyone having any issues with it. People act like someone wanting to play a ret paladin would out right refuse doing anything else than dps at any time.
---
“Only” :D
---
Go out and enjoy the sun and summer weather. You won't enjoy it for a while once Classic is out I can promise you that ;)

Layered is basically single server shardering, better than sharding, but still bad

Paladin is a strong contender for sure, sadly I'm going Horde so no Bubbleboy for me :(
---
&gt; Obviously a large portion of at least this sub is anti-flying though.
---
And Blizzard themselves. They've stated many times that they regret ever adding it.
---
I mean there's been a ton of bugs, and we haven't even seen the other half of the game yet
---
DM/WC depending on your faction are definitely worth it if you have the quests for them, and you should get the quests.

If I recall correctly Spell Penetration on gear was not a thing, until TBC, it might have been on a select very few items. However warlocks did have about 75 spell penetration via curses.. or something?.. 
---
I believe that the native resistance was 1 per level, or so... you could be at level 60, it said you had 0 shadow resistance, but in fact you had 60, you just have 0 extra for your level, which is what the stat showed.
---
This is also why a lvl60 could resist spell such as Fear, from a level 18 warlock for instance, due to that spell resistance..
---
The curse also reduced resistance, so that a level 60 could get fully cc'd by lowbies if the correct curse was applied.
---
I have no math behind this.. The baked in 60 resistance is guess work from my testing during vanilla.. As a main warlock I did a lot of testing myself, and enjoyed toying with people as well as low levels..
---
I should put a fake bubble around a beast monitor like I'm cosplaying my setup ;)
---
You forgot the B
---
BOOM
---
Hahah thats one of my highlights too :) also love when the mage comes out of the cave at 4:42.. the guy almost gives up chasing him but the mage is like "wait.. was the NPC just chasing me?" yes. yes he was!
---
If ur talking about your mouse randomly accelerating there is some command for Mouse input. Happened to me in stress test and on live
---
maybe someone has the link.
---
I really liked your reply, you have convinced me.
---
Porting a pre-existing game to a new framework can produce more bugs than creating a whole new game. A beta absolutely makes sense for something like this.
---
We got to make sure this kind of NPC remain MC'able in Classic and hit as hard as on retail, it's gonna be so much fun!
---
With good gear they are like 3-minute mages but shortened down to like 1,5 minutes or maybe 2 minutes with ZHC. They have scary offensive powers and no defensive. They have no health, no mana, just insane burst. Very fun to play if you have friends to cover your rear. Also they are protected from the engineering deflectors and nature resistance is really rare. 
---
Seeing one is rare though, but you can't unsee a shaman vaporising 3 targets with one spell combo.
---
Are you sure? You can 10 man all the other dungeons? Has this been tested in the beta?
---
Agreed. Im a big fan of prepping so I suggest this as well if u don't want to go in dark.
---
BUT MOMMMMMM, I WANT BETA ACCESS NOWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Also planning on leveling a warrior in vanilla.  Never played a warrior in vanilla, was a mage from day 1 and never leveled even 1 alt. From what I have been reading I will be speccing fury/arms. Apparently I will still be able to throw on a shield/1h and tank whilst leveling.
---
You should be able to run it pretty well. Wow is a single core intensive game and even though it's old, you might get some major fps dips in large group world pvp. Nothing too crazy but enough to lower graphics temporarily.
---
I started right before TBC launch and stopped again about 2 weeks into the expansion. Hated the leveling and wanted to focus on Starcraft Broodwar instead. I must've been around 13-14 or so.
---
I think they're fun, it's interesting to see the opinions of more people, many just lurk and don't participate in the comments.
---
Feral dps actually picks up in aq because thats where most of our bis gear is at.
---
Hi, /u/ThatBoiRen
---
Shadowed unit frames! Still use it in retail to this day. Great news.
---
Fuck sodapoppin
---
I seriously hope so. NO CHANGES!
---
Being 31 and excited like this is refreshing. Most things make me huff and puff like an old man. A feeling of been there, done that and I am over it has consumed my gaming career. Having classic back has me grinning from ear to ear! I am with you!!
---
Good! then don't be so negative bro! just enjoy the ride and lets all have a kick ass time!
---
Haha I can't believe his voice is so calm not only when making videos but when actually playing the game haha
---
I'm starting to doubt the validity of these screenshots.
---
I was 8 years old. I had found it from the South Park episode. But I was so bad at this type of game because I never played it before. I always bought armor from vendors. I had no idea an Auction House existed. I remember the yellow colored Chainmail for like level 12 or 14, in Stormwind. I was then in awe at how expensive and how good the Scalemail armor was. It looked so cool too.
---
These is either a troll or someone that doesnt even like the game and plays for an hour every second month.
---
Especially bad on laptops for some reason. I remember my internet went down just an hour before my first raid with a super hardcore guild. Newly recruited and went into Naxx for my first time and this happens. I tethered my laptop to my phone's internet and raced down to my friend's house while downloading the client. I made it but the camera issues were immediately apparent and needless to say I played horribly. Luckily they understood my peril and accepted me anyways.
---
This is just not true. Between high armor, NS, poison cleansing and grounding totems Ele shaman has good survivability if you know what you're doing.
---
3 months is a long time though.
---
Realm Discord servers will be a thing I guess.
---
I was 6 or 7.  my only memories were the few times a year i went to my cousins and hed let me play his acc.  Little did i know i was just farming tedious shit for him
---
Other sources seem to agree. Thanks :)
---
Or he leaves by the time you get there, happened to me alot. Hated it. just wanted sweet revenge
---
Tell us more.
---
Monotone murloc. I love it.
---
No it is not. The crosshair only showed for a short time when the mark was applied/reapplied. Only the overhead arrow stayed there the whole duration.
---
Sure its better than tremor totem in pvp, but at least tremor can break fear still, sometimes fast.  It is simply far and away better to never have your tank get feared by something like nefarian then to be able to break the fear immediately.
---
Lol first week of class is bulls hit anyway get to lvl 30
---
Macros could still use /script SpellStopCasting() throughout all of vanilla (it was actually a secret weapon for caster DPS) but addons couldn't see it from other players.
---
What makes hunter top tier in your mind?
---
Does renewing an old subscription also require purchasing BfA?
---
Spriest is not a wanted spec for premades, they are great at 1v1ing but in group play they simply don’t have enough mana to do sustained damage.
---
I actually have the same 2 classes as you to pick from, I can’t decide being a rogue (pro: can pvp and pve in combat swords to a pretty good casual level, very very hard to find groups for dungeons which is a big downfall for casuals) or priest (insta invites for holy priest for basically everything, would play shadow for pvp though requiring respec). I can’t choose!
---
Didn't start in 2004? Haha BC baby wait your turn while us vets flesh out the beta
---
I’m the same. Do I really want to do exactly the same thing I did 13 years ago though all over again?
---
Since I will be levelling with a group I will be in resto spec from the beginning. It's gonna be a challenge :D
---
&gt; You'll have to effectively double the amount of Paladin votes since they are only playable on one faction
---
Using that logic, this poll would indicate that we can expect more Shamans than Warriors on Horde (2080/2 &lt; 1068).  Maybe people are voting for what they're most excited about rather than what they're actually going to be maining.
---
Shouldn't do no.
---
Depends on if you ask Vanilla players or pserver players.
---
Vanilla: mages/warlocks then rogues.
---
Pserver: WAAAARRRRIOORRRRROFLMAO
---
But seriously. Warriors are pretty beast in 1.12
---
&gt; Does renewing an old subscription also require purchasing BfA?
---
No, unless you actually want to play BfA.
---
Stupid question but.... what is the release date for Classic? The WoW website says August 27, but I see streamers playing it (they are all level 30 though?) currently.
---
This is great. It’ll keep MC relevant for longer.
---
Again, when you have world buffs you want to maximized them. If they last 2 hours, you want to clear as many bosses as possible. Also most guilds want to get the weeks content down as fast as possible to give more time for progression or just to make sure the raids finish in 1-2 nights since many people like to respec after raids are finished for the week to pvp. If you’re a casual guild who doesn’t care about finishing the raids for the week or maximizing progression, this doesn’t apply. Any guild that actually cares about clearing content should be bringing consumables and world buffing.
---
It is players such as yourself that make individuals simply not care about the game anymore. It has become a toxic community simply put. People want a harder game, classic was undoubtedly harder than BOA. People like actually interacting with other players, classic wow gives them that, BOA does not. Stop being a troll, stop being an ass, you're absolutely allowed to have your opinions but you're by no matter of the means allowed to say others are idiots for not being of the same mind as you.
---
Nope, youll be subbed with everything up to Legion, just no BFA content
---
I am honestly very very surprised to see the low number of votes Rogues gets... they are beasts all game from early to end and surprised by the number of ppl wanting to play a warlock compared to a hunter.
---
I'm curious to watch the "Vanilla Vet crowd" enjoy their nochanges for 1-2 years and see how they enjoy the game. It'll be forgotten, and useless. "Play the game how it was" is another bullshit statement that just isn't true. They are acting like a small Reddit is indication of the population, but I would make a pretty good bet and say the majority won't want the exact same game for years with no updates.
---
Vanilla wasn't stagnant, it had tons of different changes and these were *unknown* changes. That means people playing shit like Feral Druid were hopeful of buffs, and continued playing. They also just accepted they weren't the most optimal, because nobody wanted to level for another 3 months. That being said, this time around will be super optimized, and we won't see the same behavior that we did back then.
---
Streamers are playing the closed beta test.
---
- solid dueling class, regularly taking top spots in private server tournaments
---
- arguably best solo world pvp class
---
- best mass world pvp class
---
- solid casual bg class
---
- very solid premade bg class, backbone of every deff in WSG
---
like mage, hunter is very viable in any pvp aspect, completely excelling at some.
---
They have access to the beta and the level cap is 30. Actual game does come out in August.
---
Yea I am in but don’t have my hopes up
---
&gt;This is not a community for private servers or current World of Warcraft.
---
Noted. Seems a bit arbitrarily enforced, no? [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a4we7l/theres\_a\_maniac\_on\_the\_loose\_best\_classic\_pvp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a4we7l/theres_a_maniac_on_the_loose_best_classic_pvp/) Quite a lot of pserver content here as it is.
---
I had never played a Shammy during vanilla past like level 10 so take this with a grain of salt but the general rule of thumb is to level as a dps spec because you will still be able to heal dungeons in that spec.
---
It is definitely a good idea, especially if you enjoy crafting your own equipment. If you want to make money though alchemy is probably the go-to, although if your server lacks Leatherworkers you can make a decent buck crafting the Devilsaur set or Hide of The Wild if you manage to get the recipe.  
---
I would absolutely urge you to not spec into Restoration until you are at or very close to max level. Simply keeping an off-set for healing will be more than enough for low-level dungeons. That is unless you really love healing. If anything go 21 points into Resto for Nature's Swiftness and the rest in another tree.
---
Will we be able to have both horde and alliance characters on the same realm?
---
They're way more interesting than the trillions of threads we get every day about "layering is bad", "new player here, is Classic worth checking out?", "which class?", "which faction?" etc. So mind numbing.
---
[Here ya go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm0akw/z/emstcpl)
---
Well, I was 36, and a native English speaker, and I sucked too.  People laughed at my woeful rogue PvP skills.  I didn't have gray armor though.  Still, I had a blast with my friends and guildies, and I still remember the night we stayed up until 4am and finally got keyed for UBRS.  So awesome!
---
&gt; Will we be able to have both horde and alliance characters on the same realm?
---
Not on PvP realms. It's possible on PvE realms though.
---
Florida Pig
---
I have 236 hours of PTO I’m going to use when it drops I’ve already put in for it. It will be legendary!
---
My main was a Shaman, I got very much used to spamming a few heals xD I definitely feel your pain, though. I signed up to be MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS\* (\*master of chain heal and a rather nifty totem macro :P).
---
I think my favourite part about my old pally, more so because I only raided with mine in BC so spent most of vanilla leveling and running dungeons, was just how reliable they were to level. Rather thrill-less, but a sturdy class from my experience.
---
No. The beta (and Classic) is locked at 1.12.1. All the dungeons were raidable in early vanilla but by 1.12.1, this option had been removed.
---
Love the editing on this
---
My friends want to go horde too but I told them I'm rolling alliance and I'll kill them at Ashenvale lol
---
I seriously doubt they will reach past level 20 because they're not into the slow paced leveling gameplay. Instead they like competitive shooter games.
---
I did convince my girlfriend to go alliance though. Very easy with the night elf model XD
---
my goal is to see how much gold I can grind up before the pvp rank system gets patched in,  I'm not gonna do a whole lot of raiding this time around but I'll still try to at least get pre raid bis tho...and my focus will be on trying to get to the higher ends of the ranks like 12/13/14.
---
I long for rank 14, I hope I can find a guild that would help me accomplish it.
---
Because it won't be summer weather anymore.
---
Its fascinating to me, i think even if i was stuck in 30/40 zones without reaching max ever id have a blast with world pvp and interacting with other players. While in retail the whole leveling content just feels like some shitty meaningless task i have to complete to even start playing the game
---
Warned my misses well in advance, Said i took 2 weeks off. don't expect anything
---
The game was designed with 2004 hardware in mind.  Youre laptop would have been impossibly powerful in 2004
---
Speak for yourself lol, some of us live in hell
---
The irony isnt lost but my point is valid.
---
I also belive im qualified to say if someone is toxic.
---
[shrug] I just think people take words too seriously. If words lose their offensive meaning, fewer people will get their feelings hurt.
---
Not a chance in hell
---
Oh crap, yeah they were.  Not until later though IIRC.
---
No, they cant keep anything. Beta servers will be gone in launch, so are the chars that were in them.
---
Fuck off with your shitty addon.
---
Can tell that there's a lot of retailbabies lurking on this sub that dont care about Vanilla at least. Otherwise my post defending a feature that was IN VANILLA would not get downvotes.
---
You people should not be allowed to have an opinion if you cant respect the game for what it was.
---
Bit unfair wouldn't you think hahah
---
Don't bats only shi- I mean guano when they're sitting upside down?
---
Any word on right-click ignore lists? Is there a limit to how many ignores you can have? Can gold-spammers be reported? Will gold-spammers and gold-farmers and gold-buyers be banned?
---
NOTHING ruins WoW experience so quickly as receiving 5 messages per minute advertising gold, levels, toons, etc. for sale.
---
Why wouldn't they just take it out of retail then?  They have had a lot of expacs and it would be pretty easy I would think to just do away with it for new content.  Only reason I can think of is because the retail players would be outraged by it.  Having to constantly build around flying has to be annoying and it would probably have been remembered much better if it was a 1-off for the TBC expansion and not carried back to Azeroth for wotlk and future xpacs.
---
Eye of Sulfuras started dropping in 1.4 :) The old Thottbot comments were revived on [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) so we can see that people started talking about them around 1.4 and several people claimed their guild saw drops by 1.4.2 :)
---
...seriously? Why in the hell would u think they would?
---
&gt;What kind of retard gets so upset over a downvote to comment about it... Pathetic.
---
Imagine defending people who abuse the downvote system for no reason.
---
Come on man, at least have no music instead of having a track being played with an very annoying sound
---
Alliance areas = symmetric
---
Horde areas = asymmetric
---
Alliance areas = Bright and/or cheerful visuals
---
Horde = dark and/or gloomy with exception.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nVQcGs9c0E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nVQcGs9c0E)  this video is talking about it
---
Elemental shamans are fucking insane, one of the best specs in pvp peroid.
---
Stress test AND beta :)
---
Good content, but the video quality is terrible.
---
I was a orc warlock during vanilla with great gear so maybe I’m bias.  But I could destroy all classes as Warlock 1v1.  I remember when talisman of ephemeral power and ZG trinkets stacked.  I could almost one shot most classes.
---
It became popular in some recent games, beta became a soft-launch essentially
---
It has never been the case with wow though
---
Dusted off my dungeon companion because of this post and also happened to find my Burning Crusade book with Outland quests and dungeons
---
This sounds really neat, I might copy that for myself.
---
Good luck with those last 3 months of waiting!
---
I mean, while I understand where you're coming from, that's been the case since late Wrath at least. The WoD change was just bringing professions in line with how the game's been played for years. Not saying it's necessarily a good thing, but the change in WoD wasn't the cause of it.
---
Yep, was just wondering if there was something more than this.
---
Thanks! :-)
---
I was 13. My parent did not let me stay up on nights for raid so I dedicated to myself to pvp. Well, I found players to play with in premade and I managed to get rank 14 as retri paladin. That was awesome time, although it was hell of a grind. My goal was from the start when I created my character to get that shining golden armor. Afterall my character was named Goldenpower. It was dwarf of course.
---
Thing is though, resto healers dont go deep resto till very geared, they go for moon glow. So its not like you miss out on a lot.
---
yea Gadetzan! and idk either, I could have been on a different character at the time. Thanks tho!
---
&gt;As far as killing world pvp, well, if they were flying away, they clearly didn't want to pvp in the first place. You aren't entitled to waste other peoples time.
---
This is the dumbest argument I have ever seen. OF COURSE you are entitled to waste other peoples time. It's the whole purpose of a PvP server.
---
We can confirm who the actual virgin is here by looking at how OP defends himself in every single comment.
---
Hi, /u/BOBBYBOYBAYOOOO
---
i have never encounted that problem, but then again i have never played on a pserver, and only played last 6 months of vanilla, so might have been fixed before that, i dunno
---
Then just roll hunter. They are the king of solo play. Make a mend pet gear set and go nuts.
---
13 here, had little english skills that helped. But i could not understand even half the game, and therefore my best memories is from TBC.
---
I am so excited to get the chance to relive this amazing game, and my hopes are that they continue adding content till late TBC.
---
&gt; "Fair" WPvP has never and will never exist. It's always ganking, camping, or 60s sitting in lowbie zones being assholes.
---
And it was never meant to be.
---
There actually used to be a warning that would pop up the first time you made a character on a PvP server warning you that this is likely what will happen.
---
And that is why I'm glad PvP servers exist, to filter people like you out of the good servers.
---
Odo’s ley staff for me, don’t think i’ll ever forget
---
Ha, that's why I always go to MC through BRD.
---
This is not an exploit either, an exploit is manipulating a bug in order to gain something from it, this is just blizzard using the wrong recycled code for flight paths and has nothing to do with being feared through walls. 
---
Aside from that, being feared through walls is indeed a bug, or I guess an exploit if someone is doing to you on purpose. This bug though was present for many expansions, including my earliest memories of classic bgs(being feared outside through the Warsong Mill from inside) and actually bgs from tbc-cata(through the stables walls in AB or the pipe in the Horde base in Twin Peaks).
---
I was 15 when I started, didn't really struggle with any of the mechanics of the game but Diablo 2 hsd left me with some OCD for exploring every inch of every map so that made leveling super slow and it took me 3 months just to ding 60.
---
all that matters is when an ele shaman is at 50% mana 2 enemies are at 0% hp.
---
Current Spellbatching timings are slightly off in beta.
---
Okay this turned into an essay.. you can skip the first two paragraphs if you only want to know how casual the raiding is.
---
The big difference between Classic and BFA imo is that you can do progressive content in a short timeframe whenever you want. You just log in, put yourself in queue and you're done within like 30 minutes to an hour. If you login to Classic and try getting a scholo run going it can take 30 minutes just to get a group going, then like 20 minutes to get out there, gotta find a key and then the dungeon takes at least an hour for an average group, less if you're overgeared and good of course, but it still takes a lot of time.    
---
LFR can be done at any time while Classic raids have to be planned. "Real" raiding in BFA of course requires the same planning as in Classic, but at least you can get into a raid in BFA without scheduling it. I think the lack of progressive content is one of the greatest faults of Classic, understandable ofc since it's so old.
---
In the AQ patch there's some quests you can do in Silithus for combat badges, tactical badges etc and essentially you have to kill mobs in Silithus to collect stuff and turn in for badges. Once you get enough of them and rep with Cenarion Circle you get some gear. I only know for Warlocks but the Rockfury Bracers you get from those turnins are actually the best bracers in the game. I really like those quests because you can login when you have like 20 minutes and kill a couple, maybe get a badge and then log out again. To my knowledge it's the only type of quests like that but there might be something similar with Argent Dawn and Naxxramas.
---
Anyways, about the casual thing. The stories about people raiding 24/7 mostly comes at the end at of Classic. The way the raids work is that they are designed to be relevant the entire expansion. So there are items in MC and especially BWL that are best in slot even in Naxxramas. At first this is pretty cool. More content to raid and it goes faster and faster every week. But once you're progressing through Naxx you not only have 15 very hard bosses to crack your head against, you also have MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and AQ40 to raid and you probably need items from most of them. A lot of guilds will probably still be progressing on C'thun by the time Naxx comes out which means their AQ runs will be pretty shaky and require a lot of time.
---
At the start though, you can easily do MC in an evening even in phase 1.
---
They are forced to hang out in Orgrimmar, which is hands down the worst layout of any capital city.
---
Have you tried
---
 /cast !Shoot
---
As the spell is called "Shoot" not "Auto Shoot"
---
Well guess what comes to a cash shop a few months after launch
---
Im a social. Person im bored and a degen but. Im  no virgin
---
No gaming just wasnt so mainstream and there werent many resources to learn from or the competitive appeal gaming has now.
---
&gt;it also means you can't be a dick to anybody as it can bite you in the ass down the line. 
---
Imagine needing a selfish reason to not be a dick.
---
I was 13 at the time playing a dwarf hunter, leveled as marksman but it was not a problem. i couldnt find a raiding guild because i was terrible at writing guild applications.   
---
But i had compared to many other players a little bit of talent when it came to pvp, and even with blue gear and the Blue crossbow from the AV quest i could 1v1 most players even raid geared ones, while playing on my dads laggy laptop that couldnt even do AV without critical FPS drops.  
---
the playerbase now has online access to all the info they need to learn how to play, back then i had the advantage because i took the time to fail untill i succeeded in my pvp strategies.   
---
people were hands down alot worse back then, and i doubt my whole server was 13 years old.   
---
But even today with 2300 arena experience and hundreds of thousands of honorable kills,  a duel against my 13 year old self would still be a tough fight.  
---
i dont think age matters that much on a mechanical skill after age of maybe 12+?    the problems i had with age was more related to raiding. i wasnt mature enough to be a part of a team.   
---
so dont underestimate youngsters. from my experience they should have more trouble in raiding content due to being more immature and having a harder time with raid schedules.    once you're decked with BWL gear and learn your class well you should have the advantage over the next generations  
---
but people are different. some people may reach a high skill level at a younger age, and some people may reach high skill levels at a higher age.
---
Hunter or Priest, the debate between both in my head is ridiculous
---
&gt;And that is why I'm glad PvP servers exist, to filter people like you out of the good servers.
---
I actually find people like you amusing. You play an MMO, and then you actually feel entitled to get to play the game solo in any way you want at any time you want to, to the point where you start to complain about ganking and try to rebrand this very core player interaction as "Wasting peoples time".
---
Pathethic how weak and spineless some people can be.
---
As with most vanilla players. I do have realm firsts from wrath though.
---
Torille.
---
He is by far IMO the best wow content creator, if you like dat monotone.
---
Will the beta players keep their progress?
---
Yeah super absurd. Considering the amount of money they're making from this fucking game lmfao. Gear design used to be so awesome. I feel like once they added transmog, they kind of just said fuck it. If they want cool gear, they can go get old shit lol.
---
People moving on to BC or Wrath because that's what they want to play isn't "splitting the community"
---
&gt; Pathethic how weak and spineless some people can be.
---
... are you just trolling, or do people actually talk like this? Because that sounds pretty psychopathic.
---
No. Everything will be wiped for launch.
---
But... my turbo charged flying machine :'(
---
The deathcharger is blue quality, but has the "very fast mount" tag. Meaning that it moves at the speed of an epic mount, but doesn't require the expensive skill to use it.
---
&gt; If they’re serious about PVP, you might have a tougher time convincing them. 
---
Incorrect, alliance dominates group pvp thanks to this little class called paladins, racials are trivial in comparison
---
&gt; Will the beta players keep their progress?
---
Almost certainly: No. 
---
As far as I know there hasn't been any official statement regarding that, but it would be highly unusual if they were to keep the progress since that hasn't happened for any WoW Beta yet.
---
Less people too.
---
30 minutes are speed runs though and they are skewed in the way that it counts from the first boss being pulled to Ragnaros dying, which means they kill all the trash up to Garr before pulling Luci and starting the counter. I'd say 2 hours is a good bet for "casual" guilds and maybe 1,5 hours when they get geared. 
---
Unless of course private servers are all wrong and MC is way harder :D
---
It's a real tough one... The mana thing sucks tbh... But I'm leaning towards priest on the basis I could probably gear it better than a rogue with the insta invites.. And a friend is going warlock so could be a good duo.
---
Someone who actually deserves to be in the Beta! Congrats. Go find major issues man!
---
/s?
---
Enjoy yourself now, it won't stop you from enjoying classic 3 months down the line
---
Will they stick to retail? Some might  but honestly the way retail wow is right now I doubt that many will stay in retail.
---
Wrath was when I quit, it was clear already to me then that Dungeon design was starting to take a hit and atleast on Thunderhorn EU the community was starting to lose it's charm. Personally for me, late Vanilla and BC was where WoW truly shined, which is why I'm actually tempted by Classic.
---
Hehe I'm talking about consecutive summers where you're too busy raiding/ranking ;)
---
we are all a bit of a dick to people from time to time what vanilla unintentionally had was the punishment when you was that dick.
---
Enchanting mats sell really well. Guild enchanters aren’t going to just enchant your gear. You need to provide them with mats which are costly. Rare patterns like crusader can be done for a charge fir being one of the few on the server to have the formula or whatever it is.
---
No, full reset on everything at launch.
---
Any good mage guides, specifically PvP or leveling focused?
---
Tailoring + Engineering for sure
---
How do they fare in premade vs premade scenarios? I've always wanted to try a shaman especially in pvp.
---
If you are going engineering you have to buy all materials as well, which can also be pretty expensive. The good thing about pairing tailoring with enchanting is that you can disenchant your worthless green tailor stuff into materials and it can potentially be more worth than what you can make in tailoring, so in the end you may be able to make good profit out of tailoring ... plus tips are expected at max level.
---
One of the best 1v1 specs in the game, youll shit on most things
---
If you wanna be pedantic yes, in general talk a fraction means a very small part.
---
just as the quest-attained winterspring frostsaber
---
Cause I laugh with the player reactions with Omar.. that's it. Why do I need to follow him, only seen like 2 videos of this guys, if you have a life who cares...
---
Dude for sure. Been saying this for weeks.
---
More than slightly but as inexpensive as you think it is.
---
People in the comments say classic is “their game” and the retail is the other half’s game. Love how classic has literally split the wow community in half
---
You can play on low setting on integrated graphics so I think you'll be just fine with whatever you choose to get.
---
I would recommend to go mostly Ele and still hit stuff in Meele during leveling, and heal in Dungeons with what you got
---
Think I was 11, I played dwarf Paladin ...  was ret, in mc and used righteous fury ... improved a lot in tbc though as a holy Paladin, and ended up with hand of Adal title. So there is hope for everyone!

Most of the time you will get more money from vendoring greens instead of disenchanting them.
---
sjw
---
I am from across the north sea, same here, but the introduction stuff usually is late august/ early september, and by the 2nd week  it's full speed again.
---
I was 7 and watched my dad doing stuff until he let me play in BC era.
---
So I was not able to actually experience classic and raiding really. I had fun then but i’m looking forward to being able to experience it on my own terms.
---
Do we need a new account for classic? Or is it possible to merge the accounts?
---
(I haven't touched my account since 2009 but still...)
---
You'll be leveling up with wands and Enchanting lets you make them. Some speed levelers pick it up with tailoring ot make the first wand then dump it for something else.
---
Yeah i'm sure those guide books are gonna be really useful [PepeLaugh](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/028/577/pepelaughz.jpg)

If you post about what quests you have to do. People are going to tell you what to do.

---
&gt; If they last 2 hours, you want to clear as many bosses as possible.
---
You re not going to a farm raid with the world buffs tho
---
Miss dodge parry is a cruel mistress
---
Or just offer flying mount as a part of those quests specifically.
---
Based how many fights you pick based on your post history i’m sure you’re in the same boat as him buddy.
---
(Maybe not on the topic of the n-word but...)
---
You’re not better because you think your vocabulary is more moral. If you were around during the old net you’d be starting flame wars and picking more fights than ever.
---
It can be a little cringe at times but I still love that machinima.
---
For raids on farm status my guild will begin to talk about meme specs. For progression absolutely not one slot will be given to them
---
PoM Polymorph :P
---
Yeh it’s always good to synergise with your friends. My girlfriend is going warlock as well, maybe I should try and get her to go priest so we get invites!
---
Sure thing, u/bigdicktoilet.
---
Kinda funny you [applied the same 'overused meme' yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/HvSTpUR.png). Guess we share that nobody found either of us hilarious.
---
yeah sry i opened something on a wow related subreddit and was trying to find out what the fuck this meme is from the comments
---
They could be doing both...
---
We miss some, which is absolutely true and I imagine a bit frustrating. Please report them when you find them, but we do the best we can.
---
I haven't played since Cata so I'm no retail expert, but I believe they actually wanted to do this for Warlords (and beyond) but there was backlash. Again I could be mistaken but I believe since then they've waited a little while to enable flying for each expac.
---
Premades bring ele/resto shaman, so they are good, they always have a spot. WSG meta brings 1. AB meta brings 2.
---
Shaman has effectively been one of the highest in every strawpoll I've seen once you double it to account for being Horde only. 
---
Makes me think raid spots and gear might be difficult to get.
---
There are two definitions listed there.  
---
1  **:** in a [literal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literal#h1) sense or manner  
---
2  **:** [in effect](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/effect#h1) **:** [virtually](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtually)
---
Im not sure how they do playing against high rank pvpers. In theory they should be one of the best if not the best ranged dps because of the burst they provide in a short peroid of time.
---
Hell youre even a decent healer cuz ur main pvp spec is primarily resto and other points in ele.
---
If youre looking to pvp you wont go wrong with an ele shaman thats for sure. Dont touch enhancement though lol.
---
Google "wrex elemental shaman pvp vanilla" and just chevk out how he just obliterates people with just chain/shock combo. Seriously ele is insane. There are few specs this broken in pvp id count warlocks somewhere around the same bracket
---
Well, there's always fire mages and engineering affliction locks (parachute)
---
Engineering is a money pit. Pairs with mining. 
---
Alchemy will be a money pit without herb. 
---
Tailoring is your best bet. You make greens to DE for mats and either sell the mats or use them on the gear you make. Then either sell the enchanted gear or DE for more mats. 
---
As a lock, wand progression isn’t as demanding as a priest but is a massive QoL item. With Tailoring and Enchanting, you can make 2 very good wands for leveling. You can easily make a Lesser Magic Wand by level 6-7 with some farming done. Plus, coke server start, you can make a lot of gold quickly by selling wands bc they are just that damn good.
---
What about PvP? I haven’t played vanilla, but doesn’t it force you to play weekly to rank up and gain your PvP set?
---
Youd never fly into anyone anyway dude. Flying added another _infinite_ axis to traveling. You can go soooo high that its impossible for anyone to know which way youre coming. You cant block the entire sky, like you can a chokepoint in Isle of Queldanas or Barrens or Stonetalon or Hillsbrad
---
And paladins, this why you should always use Blessing of Protection.
---
&gt; Do we need a new account for classic? Or is it possible to merge the accounts? (I haven't touched my account since 2009 but still...)
---
You can just renew the subscription for your old account once Classic launches. No need to create a new account - unless that's what you want to do.
---
I mean I guess we can turn this into a if I do the exact perfect thing and they stand there....Sure you can destroy shaman.  But a good shaman between totems, purge and earth-shock. Shaman is one of the more difficult foes for warlock.  Also curse of tongues is worthless most shamans will heal one time during a fight/duel and it will be natures swiftness instant cast.  Plus all there shocks and totems are instant cast.
---
What are the easiest collecting professions to level while leveling? I've tried mining, but I never find enough mining nodes in zones I'm questing in to keep up with the rate that I am leveling, thus I fall behind and eventually can't mine anything in a zone.
---
Just because you were garbo in Vanilla, doesn't mean everyone else was.
---
Knowing how to play and gear your class correctly was absolutely something people did back then.
---
this is very helpful thank you very much :) I'll google the wrex guy.
---
I still love this machinima, always liked how they created an Arthas lol.
---
Let’s keep in touch and play together if you want. I’ll be casual too. Pretty much everything you wrote is my exact situation. I’d love to play more but simply life gets in the way. I love playing solo but also enjoy grouping up or dungeons and pvp, and want to raid eventually. 
---
Hit me up if you want a chill casual in game friend.
---
I haven't read the thread but i can bet someone made a feign death joke there too.
---
Classic pally winning pvp while burning everything is not impressive.
---
Happy to help. :)
---
Wrex is why I’m rolling Tauren shaman. Can’t wait to warstomp and chain lighting some noobs.
---
(It aged poorly)
---
Max rank heals? Shit. Ret aura? Shit. Hand of Justice? Dogshit!
---
I know....my little gnome mage felt badass.
---
pretty sure he was talking about the receiving end of the chain lightning.
---
Came here to say this but that's definitely spirit visage. Force of Nature was removed when they stopped with the Nexus Blitz game mode
---
I have been searching up on hunters in classic as I played one when I started back at the end of BC I haven't played one in a while and I'm trying to find guides for pvp gear in classic. I don't want to be that hunter dick that rolls on everything especially since hunters can equip pretty much everything. I of course won't roll on plate and cloth would suck for the casters but any mail and leather is fair game (if it truly is better for me). Oww and I'm looking forward to going against you in WSG and Arathil Basin.
---
Might not get a wand until 12-13 or so. In which case spirit tap first isnt bad. +15% wand damage when for a wand doing 27 damage is literally nothing.
---
I diddnt know until I saw the list. As im a contrarian. Now I know paladin is least popular, it will be femdwarf paladin most likely.
---
That’s just someone who got infinite time on their hands. Someone who, if they play a game for 8+ hours a day don’t miss a single thing irl. It’s actually sad
---
You are most likely correct, it would also make perfect sense. Thanks :)
---
Ive watched the whole vid for a few times now and i still get caught off guard how he just randomly deletes people without any effort whatsoever
---
The human male one was pretty impressive, I have no clip though sadly
---
They are actually very strong, but you are not a 1v1 spec.  your role in pvp is being a burst turret that can annihilate targets with a lightning bolt-chain lightning-shock combo, and you have totem utility.   those 3 spells hit at the same time for incredible burst.     
---
with just blue spellpower gear your combo (no crits)  will deal about 1800-2k damage, and it only has like a 6-7 second cooldown before you can do it again.   
---
so if you get lucky and crit with those spells, you can basically one shot some players also wearing blue items.  
---
You also scale very well for pvp. in AQ 40 gear you can crit like 1700 with lightning bolt and chain lightning(up to 2k with a flask). your shock spells crit for like 1400-1500.  so yeah, it is basically the highest burst damage in the entire game along with a pom pyro mage and a recklessless warrior with sword skill procs. but your combo is on a 6 second cooldown, not 5 minutes or 30 minutes.   
---
You are absolutely terrible at PVE though because of high mana costs, so it is a pvp only spec. and you will have mana issues after a couple combos.  
---
You struggle vs warlocks (curse of tongues and you can go grab a drink) and melee dps makes your life misserable since you rely on hard casting for 4 seconds to dish out your damage potential.  
---
so for BG's in a group environment, you are a top tier spec, and things only get better as you acquire gear.  keywords are crit and spellpower, but its hard to get proper raid items for the spec.
---
Raise your flippers to the sky!
---
Personally as old paladin veteran, I don't recommend playing the class unless you are 100% sure what to expect. I was doing pvp as retri paladin on vanilla, it was enjoyable, but note that only viable role for raiding is being healer/support. I'll suggest that you think about first which is your primary role and focus picking class to that suits your playstyle. If you want to heal, then priest/shaman is viable option. Druid has issues as well, it's jack of all trades but master of none. Holy paladin has efficient healing capability, but it may be boring to just use different ranks of flash of lights and keeping buffs up on raids. If you are more interested in pvp, then paladin is great fit to team. It's defensive/supportive class meant to play with others. But as I noted, I wouldn't touch paladin if you are not 100% dedicated to do so.
---
5 man dungeons are viable with any specc, but if your aim is pve raiding, then you have hard time finding spots for other speccs than holy. It's not impossible, but you know, why waste your effort if you can make it easier with other classes?
---
What you describe sounds like a problem that never happened to me and I played about a week after vanilla launch.
---
Realm firsts and toxic attitude ...
---
Ony buffs will be much more rare on Classic than private servers.  Private servers removed the cool down on world buff turn ins.
---
Everyone enjoyed flying in TBC and few if any here are anti-flying *directly*.
---
The anti-flying sentiment comes entirely from how it effectively ended world PvP, removed the functionality of world design leaving only the eye-candy part of it, and started the descent towards a game without any actual community.
---
The sentiment put more succinctly:  
---
Flying is essentially paving the road to hell.
---
Technically speaking...Warriors are the _only_ hybrid since they have two viable and optimal roles in pve. Best tank, obviously, and arguably best dps. No other class can say that they’re the best OR even cutting edge viable as 2 different roles.
---
Skinning is the only one that can keep up if you're focusing on leveling. Herbing is easier than mining but you still need to go out of your way for it.
---
Can i loggin in my old account ? Even if not on active subscription? I am not sure what my password was ;-)
---
How do you expect anyone to be able to make your own choices for you?
---
These make me so happy. You're the bestestest.
---
Why would anyone be mad anyway. How much of a greater change you think youd have if the odd 100 streamers didnt get access? Such a stupid thing to be mad about.
---
If the ignore list has a limit there will be an addon to solve that
---
They already stated no cash shop in classic, but okay
---
Wasn't it confirmed that Classic will have cheap skills and expensive mounts as was the case during almost all of vanilla? Can't remember if it was actually confirmed.
---
Absolutely. I am an absolute casual player that has enjoyed Classic a lot.
---
Goldshire &gt; Outside Orgrimmar
---
If that's the case, tether from your phone.
---
Pallys used to be able to solo a lot of elites. Also, dying felt almost like a chore, since you had sl many ways to prevent it.
---
the way it used to work was that if you were the only player in the dungeon and used the reset instance macro before logging out, you would get teleported out of the instance.  did you test this?
---
Why? What specific reason makes you feel that way?
---
Test classes out.
---
Don't forget that the red qiraji mount is the fastest ;)
---
Shall we make a guild for casuals? :D
---
But streamers don't test anything they just make money on people's nostalgia and on limited access to beta, I have weird feeling about this
---
something something penis innuedo
---
This guy's going places
---
It was common to call out clickers and keyboard turners during the period.
---
I would contact blizzard if you are having trouble with accessing your account.
---
*Cough* me *Cough*
---
But really wow was just an excuse/enabler it doesn't deserve the blame.
---
I know and it looks so fun haha. I can’t wait to blow up 60s and be known for torturing lowbies. Crits must be even better on low levels 😂.
---
I also can’t imagine playing a class that can’t heal themselves since I used to main a retpaladin.
---
Best proffesions for a Warlock.
---
I am thinking Enchanting/Mining or Herb/Alchemy. 
---
Could also go for Mining/engenering.
---
Nope.. there are no "PVP Sets" like you know it, only for Rank 14 and 13, and basicly only a Hand  full of people will ever get those. Everyone else joins the BGs with their PvE gear.
---
"Boo hoo hoo" is all you write. If I imagine that everyone I gank is like you, it makes it even better. Delicious weakling tears.
---
I guess the Blizzard Customer Support should be able to help you out with that if you can prove you are the owner of the account (ID or original CD-Key should do it). 
---
You should be able to log in to the account [on the Battle.net page](https://account.blizzard.com) once you have the password again.
---
assuming his friends all have OCD
---
Maybe it’s just me, but the whole purpose of hunters mark is to put a big obnoxious red arrow above your head so you stand out. The blinking doesn’t really take away from the spell, it actually makes it work better.
---
I like SWTOR for the story lines, I think it will do a great job of holding people over for a while, if you are into the Star Wars universe that is.
---
He just got into beta? Someone at Blizz should be fired for the fact that I got into the Beta before him.
---
Yup! The only thing they are good for right now is getting your characters looks down so that come launch day, you can just do all that stuff super quick, grab your name and then hop right in!
---
Only thing I learned from pservers the class I want to play after messing with a bunch of different toons to varying levels.
---
Its a shame we cant wear it lol. Paladin plate is practically non existant. We wear leather and cloth.
---
A bold move posting something like this here. Prepare for the downvotes from hashtag nochanges purists.
---
That works until people get really mad, especially cause they asked for a sub in order to get considered for a beta invite, and now the waves are done and they only invite streamers.
---
No it was vanilla as well. I'm positive.
---
Can't wait for that top 10 bugs and inconsistencies in wow classic beta!
---
I've seen people claim it wasn't in vanilla, and i swear i remember having to run back to the entrance in dungeons as that's why i favored DM + stocks since they're small or have an exit for low cloth farming.
---
I tried looking but couldn't find any mention of it before it was a thing on pservers.
---
Only problem is the 5 instances/hr limit. Just did 10 runs and only 1 Rare ._.
---
I am playing a Paladin to raid with going to level up as ret but raid as holy. I am kinda glad no one really want to play the hybrid classes as it means it will be easier to get a raid spot and loot.
---

---
I'd only recommend engineering if you plan on doing PvP, it's not that great for making money either. Alchemy or Enchanting are good choices and really helpful for guilds. For me, I'll probably do Herb/Alch.
---
Or just people who are sick and tired of this thread 600 times a day.
---
I am no hardware pro, but my dads laptop in 2004 was enough for me to play.  my phone has better specs than that.   you can probably run the game in full graphic and have no lag in a 40 vs 40 alternac valley fight.
---
Does threat management really hold back horde warlocks?  The one thing keeping me from rolling a lock is that I might eventually have to gimp my dps bc of threat.  Can any horde locks give advice if the class is worth playing?
---
Thanks for the warning! xD
---
Cherry picking definitions...

&gt;used to emphasize the truth and accuracy of a statement or description

The party was attended by literally hundreds of people.
---
source on classic having world buff cooldowns?
---
Would you say tanking in vanilla is hard? Im looking to play prot warrior for a guild im joining and i have never tanked before lmao. Have played since late wotlk but literally never tanked a raid. Do you think i could pick it up relatively okay or is it a hard role in classic?
---
its pretty inexpensive. No art team needed, no sound team needed. Very little to no direction needed.  
---
Basically just devs and engineers. Not even one third of original.
---
This guy totally sounds like someone who read about raiding and didn't actually do it. Who the fuck wasted expensive mats or all that time to clear a raid ~20 minutes faster?
---
Spriests good for 1v1, not really wanted for premades. Rogues also good for 1v1 and premades will bring 1 to guard the flag. Thats basically it. If you have no desire to heal whatsoever I would personally pick rogue.
---
Classic comes next.
---
Please keep these coming they're giving me life
---
:*
---
Congatulations on beeing a douche. Don‘t expect everyone to be 24/7 online and reading every downvoted thread.
---
Agree, don’t post retail, just dive in to classic blind and enjoy it
---
I just don’t think unemployment is a joke. If you’re actively choosing to not work and are of working age, you’ve either done a great job with savings/are in between jobs OR probably living off someone else’s dime. I know it’s funny to joke about no job, no school, no gf for classic wow, but it’s losing its comedic value.
---
Druids are honestly some of the best 5 man healers in the game. In vanilla I always preferred a Druid healer. Their HoT are easy to keep up and they can battle rez.
---
A parent who doesn’t pick up on and encourages a child‘s passion are doing it wrong. Glad you get to join us in Classic m8.
---
‚A while after the last content patch‘
---
Another classic release? I‘m in!
---
I guess just as it was cpmmon to call out toxic players ^^
---
I saw a poll the other day from a stream audience I think and like a quarter of people said they were picking a warrior. Then mages were choice two then the rest were evenly distributed.
---
Yea thats kind of true. Oh well we cant have it all. I watched staysafe a bit earlier he was with a group grinding mining in searing gorge.
---
It looked so cool going into this hyper danger zone where u body pull all the mobs and get whacked by them just so you could extract some mithril ore. Looked super cool.
---
That is awesome!
---
Well thank God he's not gay AND a neckbeard. /s
---
But it’s not? It’s just more rare.
---
I feel like I remember this being in for bc and wratch. I could also just be thinkinn of the alliance ramp to the roof.
---
Never saw such a post yesterday or today, maybe I missed the 1.2k :)
---
I will venture a guess that this level of overreaction is solely to wake the viewers up.
---
unless they add rallying cry to IF it’ll probably be SW even at 60
---
On the other hand without the community some very complex problems might not get solved. Also an existence lived solely for the individual is a rather selfish one in my opinion.
---
&gt; There weren't mouseover macros in vanilla. The new macro system bypasses a hard balance check rogues had.
---
Not strictly true - in fact quite the opposite technically. The vanilla WoW API was both much more powerful and exposed than later expansions, even in BC. It was so powerful  that for example you could create macros that run scripts enabling you to spam one ability to play the whole game for you!
---
To actually prevent that from happening, Blizzard removed such powerful low level API access via scripts (and addons) and exposed a much more limited version of it more directly and accessibly via macro commands, including the use of UnitIDs like @mouseover, from patch 2.0 onwards. However, the mouseover functionality had always been present just not available directly in macro commands.
---
So, the lack of mouseover macros in vanilla to be used by rogues or anyone else was to do with the lack of many sophisticated players at that early point in the game and was relatively unknown in the meta.
---
There will be a million warriors. Maybe half will tank. Will any of them be good? Probably half. Will any of those million stick with warrior through the absolute madness that is leveling a warrior through classic?
---
It's possible entitled was the wrong word. Sorry if I offended you. 
---
It just seems a bit harsh to call it "disgraceful" if this particular change didn't make it in.
---
From my experience on the stress test, take some people and go outside the starting zone. In the dwarf/gnome zone we did the delivery quests to Kharanos and Steelgrill Depot when we could and  grinded beasts a bit further out until we could 5 man grind the yeti cave and since they were humanoids made some extra copper.
---
That is true, but in this specific context I’m not sure it works. Judging by the thread, it seems like Nano had passed away recently, and the funeral had been held within the past few days. The family was, in all likelihood, still very much in the grieving process, so not enough time has really passed to really spin comedy off it. It just comes off as insensitive.
---
I was in a GPU guild in MoP
---
Something like this is a perfect, subtle way to support your love for Azaeroth! Need one for my desk/game station!
---
For sure, saw someone mention classic wow in The Division subreddit. Caught my eye, read some articles. Now I resubbed till classic.
---
Yep
---
How many fish fished for a fishing skill up? At what fishing level does it go up and what does it go to?
---
zero, dwarf priest is the only one that people would care about. the rest is whatever. Go for your nelf bro, enjoy it.
---
If you have no reason to need to hit 60 by a specific point, i.e obligated raid spot then i wouldn't bother as you can test classes out on release like we all did back in the day, no need to try them out on pservers if you're in no rush.
---
If you have a spot but no class requirement then i'd test them out, 1-20 is quite a distance on vanilla and getting a number of classes there will cost you like a day, again no problem if you're in no rush.
---
If you have a spot and a class requirement it's pretty pointless to try it out as all you're left with is route planning, and IMO there's no point pushing a char up on a pserver with this much time to go unless you're planning to server first your class on launch.
---
tldr; Wait unless you have a requirement to ding 60 within 14 days or so, if that's the case try out classes on pserver so you can level the one you know you want on launch.
---
I can't imagine mana being a problem, since fights don't last a very long time. In bg's there seems to be a lot of downtime.
---
Wait, this isn't ironic copypasta?
---
The classic team are hard at it making the game work. They have more than enough bugs and features to improve and implement as it is. They clearly do not need the additional noise.
---
Now, as for the subscription. Them saying you need an active subscription to get an invite is wrong... how?   
---
You are not forced to play the beta. You do not *have* to play the beta. You are losing nothing by not playing the beta.
---
Look at it from the Blizzard team's perspective. Inviting you would help them how exactly? What can you bring to the Beta table?   
---
I'm sure you answer is something else than "nothing", but the actual answer *is* nothing. 
---
You and the rest of the rabid whiners are not better than the testers they have. You are probably worse. I'm sure you've played a shitload on Private servers and "know how everything should be", talk about a shitload of bug-report noise now that we've seen just how *wrong* the private servers have everything.
---
Long story short. Calm your entitled little titties. Go for a jog instead so you won't be so annoying come release (or the extended beta.)
---
How many servers will be available for the US/EU? And will they have the same tags as now? (PVP, PVE etc)
---
I can't wait for all the #NoChanges people to find something that they didn't remember, get pissed about it, and then demand it be fixed. The best thing is they already lost because there are plenty of changes.
---
This has always been the case, but many users are still surprised whenever a new Blizzard Beta launches. The beta invite priority has been as follows (&gt;10yrs):
---
1. Blizzard Staff
---
2. Blizzard Friends &amp; Family
---
3. Celebrities
---
4. Streamers, Media &amp; Other Major Influencers (*restrictions apply)
---
5. The other 99% (sorted by hwspec first)
---
* There's a list. Only users that paint Blizzard in a good light and aren't on their blacklist.
---
If that makes you angry, you have no idea what kind of perks that celebrities get too. =]
---
I mean alliance is really for higher class people tbh, should be enough right there
---
Could just be as simple as “vanilla or live” options, and it applies to everything. Having you pick and choose everything would just be a bit much. They wouldn’t be developing new models/animations, they’d just be porting the assets to over and letting us choose which to use on a client side basis.
---
It means 27th of August at 12am
---
You can actually hear the excitement in his voice at the start of his first Classic stream.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/429572639
---
For good ITEMS.
---
Not for rogue
---
As a fresh 60 on a fresh server one of the really good moneymakers you can do is farming EPL bats for gold while waiting for dungeons. 
---
Other than that obviously there is devilsaurs, but that reuqires a lot of effort.
---
I wonder what that dude was doing on those pics for real
---
Except that DR was 15 seconds in vanilla and sap had an increase chance of breaking free (heartbeat resist) added in 1.2.
---
Haha! Awesome ty
---
A minute after 26th of August 23:59.
---
That price will go up soon
---
These will probably be the only beta clips I will actually watch. Hell its about time.
---
I always wanted dressed banker, but I was afraid that someone would hack me, because dressed bankers have only wealthy players. Haha, was back in tbc times

You answered your own question. 27 August at midnight, so basically 26th August at 23:59
---
Thank you.
---
Get new friends
---
I thought there is also a blue set for lower (casual friendly) ranks
---
If it's 12 AM, it has passed into the next day.
---
Monday 23:59 PM -&gt; Tuesday 12:00 AM.
---
So on Monday the 26th, get a good nap in during the day, and when it's 1 second past midnight and crossing into the Tuesday, the release will happen.
---
Hey,
---
If we can agree Warriors can tank 5 man's as dps spec with a tank set, you can sell tanking services or reserve orbs or other gear during runs.
---
If you have a healer friend, you can tag team DM runs. 
---
Lastly, go farm up some rare drops out recipes.
---
Good luck, and thanks for tanking.
---
If you are worried about burn out maybe try the faction you normally dont play and a different class
---
IMO classic is better then retail for casuals, if you wanna mythic raiding you gotta spam m10 all day every day for hours.
---
They don't need the additional bug reports and data. They have enough. 
---
They're extending the beta in the next round, because they'll need more data and the most common bugs will have been found. 
---
This is not "your game", this is not your little sandbox. This is a serious corporate project with economic concerns, resource allocation concerns, and deadlines to meet.   
---
The beta scheme is a good one for all intents and purposes. 
---
**May not be to *your* liking but the classic team knows better than you.**
---
A lot of people saying they're going to be warrior mains because of how strong they are late game. Don't forget they're the longest class to level, require a healer in PvP and are extremely gear dependant.
---
No shit...
---
No. You should go into classic completely fresh. The retail game is complete trash
---
They have aq gear both of them, so not that hard
---
Good Edit on your name Solor!
---
Wrong stealth animations for rogues. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OKCUxRCILks
---
Cry more.
---
Depending on the patch though stormwind was really popular because it was a short flight to booty bay for the boat so people could get to silithus.
---
r/fiftyfifty
---
Leatherworking is not a good profession to have on a first character imo, unless you're willing to build alts or have the gold to buy non-leather mats.
---
I'm not gonna bash you for starting yet another one of these threads. There isn't a lot else to talk about. If people don't like it they can down vote and move along.
---
I am hoping for something similar. I'd like them to do horizontal progression of some kind. I think raising the level cap and invalidating everything that existed in the game was a bad was of progressing. I'd love it if they continued the spirit of Vanilla and released content that the had planned but didn't get around to until later, like Kara.
---
There are two downsides to this approach. First, TBC did a lot to fix the shittier specs. This was generally a positive change, but has not place in Classic, even after all phases are over. Second, for all it's faults, I still think TBC was the high point of WoW and part of me hopes they progress on to a Classic version of it. I think financially, a TBC: Classic is the most likely option for Blizzard to take.
---
During stress test I saw a couple Humans running around doing quests in Shadowglen the next day. Anything is possible I guess.
---
Low effort troll is low effort
---
No one knows for how many servers
---
woosh
---
Unfortunately i’d put all my talent points into a Raw Dog spec
---
For sure, as a loyal citizen of Alliance. I'm going this time for brutish Horde to melt some faces.
---
OMG once i got in there was also rollback! This brings back memorys ;P
---
Shamans are actually elem resto hybrids for pre-made. I'd also say that he's wrong on druid, druid tank 8s extremely viable, and the flag carrier buid is used in pvp'
---
&gt; This is not "your game", this is not your little sandbox. This is a serious corporate project with economic concerns, resource allocation concerns, and deadlines to meet.
---
I don't know why you're talking to me like an angry teacher, but nonetheless you haven't explained the problem in doubling the current beta population, I don't see any negative effects, only positive, which would be finding bugs.
---
Or they were just excited?
---
When exactly will it launch in eu? Midnight between 26-27, middle of day 27?
---
Can we just start over?  I think we're all excited for classic and the majority of the above discussion I had with a person who is clearly angry in general while I think you are just excited to be part of the hype of classic.  All I was trying to say is lets try to understand our brothers in retail and forgive them their misconceptions.
---
it was kinda cool tho
---
Fuck. That.
---
Everyone: in case you didn't play Vanilla IF was *the place to be.* It's close to most of the raids you'll be doing. It's a big circle so everything is generally closer together. And it's way cooler.
---
Cool thanks for the advice! My plans was exactly that, to tank as arms while using a spare tank set. I’ll see if I can make some money that way
---
it was changed in vanilla to not be mc able
---
It'll be fine. Raids want a lot of shaman for totem buffing every group, but don't expect to be a DPS shaman in a competitive raid environment
---
It was removed in patch 1.11 by making detect traps a passive ability.
---
isn't it 6pM?
---
Terrible move if true. Destroys a whole aspect of world pvp if you don't have people coming in to slay the undead rogues in redridge. That was half the gameplay for some 60s.
---
All I do is ele sham for the past 2 years. The key is to be an offensive support class. You gotta heal teammates, cure poisons, purge ur raids targets, to really shine. Sometimes just following a warrior, dropping wf totem purging his target and even twisting a grounding in for him works well. Also, learn to not always use chain lightning as it’s very mana intensive compared to lightning bolt. Curing poison is also huge, especially when a rogue jumps ur teams priest. They have a ton of tools, just gotta figure out how and when to use all of them. Overall, a beast of a pvp class and one of the most impactful for horde teams when played at a high level.
---
if you tell us why they want to play horde then we can tell you how to tell them they are wrong
---
The pt that you glossed over is that blizz has lost it's soul, and now only cares about money.  95% of your money is going to pay for the content of retail game and profit.   
---
This notion that they'll release Kara for classic, and release tBC classic at the same time is ridiculous.   That's not something the current company would ever consider doing.   Hell, it's wishful thinking for any company, but this one, not a chance in hell.
---
Hell, it's highly likely that classic will be such a flop that they won't even consider making tbc classic.
---
You are right but for the wrong reasons. Clique is an addon from the WotLK expansion. It has been successfully backported to pserver vanilla clients because that support for such features had always been present in the WoW API.
---
Really? 
---
I thought I saw a post from blizzard saying August 26th at 6pm est time.
---
I don’t know why your being downvoted. Not like he’s a bad person because of it, but he definitely was playing very poorly. Bad blink, somehow thought the enemy would just chase, went in the hut, didn’t sheep or reset well. In vanilla a competent player destroys newbies, and CD usage matters a ton - no mage playing badly will win against a pala who presses CDs
---
I even works on my 49 inch 32:9
---
You don't know the half of it. I've been on Deathwing from the launch of the game till now.
---
Back in Vanilla and BC it was the best, because well you know, there was actually a self-contained identity then. Known more affectionately as Dramawing, being a very high pop realm meant all sorts of chances for some really stupid drama, like druids needing on felstrikers against rogues cause they thought the proc would work in forms, etc. Or people exploding on the forums about getting ganked 24/7...
---
I miss those times.
---
Very relaxing. Id take that over spazz any day.
---
It launches at 6pm Eastern US August 26th so figured it out.
---
The fact that this isn't the most upvoted comment here is kind of concerning.
---
Global release is best release. See ya in 3 months :)
---
Ive heard that alliance had a lot more development time originally and horde was all done last minute. Might also be why ally get typical high fantasy structures unique to each race while horde get almost exclusively huts.
---
It'll launch on August 27 at 00:00, so one minute after August 26 23:59.
---
Reckoning won’t be good on live since you can’t guarantee proc it. 
---
Repentance works in PVP,  so you can’t say no utility.
---
LBRS and UBRS are the same instance. You can't complete the LBRS quests in a raid group
---
It was epic! Costed 900g IIRC, and didn’t require 150 skill. Unsure if in 1.12.1 it required tiger riding aswell.
---
Which professions are consistent money? or best money makers?
---
To be fair, they need it. Foods hard to come by in weather like that!
---
You can level fishing to 300 in the cities.
---
Fine. I'll quote myself. 
---
&gt; They don't need the additional bug reports and data. They have enough.
---
More bug reports at this point is very likely just added noise they have to filter through in order to do their job of getting the game ready.   
---
Simply put, more is not always better.
---
the almost unquantifiable "feel" of a game is incredibly important.
---
The original DOOM would have never been as big as it was if the shotgun "Felt" bad to shoot.
---
Who doesnt love MadSeason, brilliant creator :D
---
AM/PM really fucking sucks. There are 24 hours in a day, so why not just use that way to tell time?    The real time is 27th of August, 00:00.
---
Max skill is 300. You will need to fish around 25 per skill level in the end. Get fishing gear with plus fishing skill to level quicker
---
 Wrist +21 frozen damage Boots +21 frozen damage OR  PVP boots + Gloves Gloves : PVP gloves, Atal'ai with frozen wrath is 1:16000  drop chance (not sure if changed on classic) Weapon: argueable that a +14 frozen wrath dagger is better.  Or maraudon dagger most likely will be bis Wand: +21 frozen wrath (or +15 if true 1.12 items)
---
Saw alot of issues in phase 2 and 3 aswell, for mages that is.
---
Elemental has mana issues as their only real problem. Back in the day very rarely did people mana burn, now with 14 years of wisdom I can see shamans getting drained dry in seconds and it remains to be seen how powerful they actually will be..
---
Their damage is very high but they are also somewhat easy to disable by mana drains and they bring no CC what so ever.
---
1. Write a report and send it into the void hoping that eventually a dev sees it and cares.
---
2. Make a Reddit post that might gain traction and make more people aware of the issue.
---
If you really cared about an issue what option would you pick?

Link us to a comment saying it is "more realistic"
---
Rumors going around in the beta currently that dungeon mob exp is much higher compared to private servers. I've heard streamers discussing leveling via dungeons exclusivley the past couple days. This isn't misinformation. I'd send a clip from sodas stream, but to lazy to dig for it. Possible HUGE bug or game changing discovery?
---
BuT I tHouGHt It WaS StrEemeR OnLeE!!
---
One thing I know is that there's always room for one more shaman horde side, so I'd feel good about it.
---
I just bought a 2400€ set-up, my friends hate me when I say I can’t wait to play Classic on it😂
---
Here I thought it was 3 pm PDT.
---
Imagine the sub numbers they got just for the beta. The actual launch will bring millions of people, even if for couple months only. I hope it will be worth it and eventually blizzard decides for tbc, could be the same boom and fun for us, meanwhile good cash for them.
---
I respect no changes but I feel like a little bit of tweak for classes like Paladin to make them more likeable and viable would be OK. Atleast for class variety.
---
pretty sure u may have to manually log out after u make a macro before u dc or it wont save.
---
&gt;FINAL
---
HAHA ;P 1st draft was even better, it was animated gif editing my name from char selection :)
---
There was a colossal shitstorm when they announced there would not be flying from WoD onwards. 
---
Blizzard tried to explain to the players but they were not able to even understand so forums were just brainless walls of insults.
---
Europe is probably the worst. I have to somehow try to sleep from 16-23 or something to be ready for 24 hours on release..

There is, there's the blue set from I think like rank 7 to 9? Then the epic set is rank 12 and 13 iirc

---
Yh only time I can see it happening is when raids are on farm
---
Or just lower the max height you can fly at significantly. Allow you to fly over the land out of range of mobs but still in range to get hit by players and give each class a ranged ability with say a 60% chance to dismount. You’d still be able to avoid some pvp but it could also spark more wars.
---
(Just thought of this answer on the fly, not saying it’s a good one)
---
Silver lining? Maybe it’ll take her back to remembering only vanilla WoW.
---
I'd like only being able to mount a flying mount at a flight point, and the mount having a stamina timer limiting its distance. Maybe a slower than ground mount speed, because the flight freedom *is* the speed upgrade. 
---
Still feels like a powerful upgrade, still gives a sense of freedom and exploration, but removes a lot of the world pvp ramifications and retains the idea that once you're away from a town you're on an adventure in a hostile world.
---
That could also create classic-feeling moments that never existed in WoW. Flew yourself up to one of those floating islands in Nagrand for fun? Cool, hope you have a plan to get down.  In a town getting raided by a pvp group? You have an evacuation button, but they could mount up and follow you on the ground until you're forced to land.
---
You don't really need much tanking gear to tank 5-mans. Just don't use leather dps gear and put on a shield. Also try and keep a priest in your group for the undead instances and always bring a mage for water and polymorphs.
---
Shadow priests are as mentioned S tier 1v1 as undead.  they are incredible.    
---
Pros: s tier 1v1--  you have a talent that add a debuff every time you use a shadow spell on a player to cover your shadow word pain from being dispelled--  you can mana burn healers while having dots up-- you are quite tanky-- great damage even while pressured. -- aoe fear is great for teamfights - if healers spam dispell your dots, just spam rank 1 shadow word pain to overwhelm the enemy team with 2 debuffs every global cooldown and then switch back to max rank once they give up.  
---
Cons: you have some mana issues, and if the enemy hunter(s) are smart and target you with viper sting, you will spend half the BG drinking-- paladins cleanse will allways remove your devouring plague instantly, and dwarves can stoneform it away --  priests can easily dispell your dots because they remove 2 effects each cast, and paladins can too if you dont cover your dots with the talented shadow weakness debuff. -- you are quite immobile.
---
So yeah, if the enemy team doesnt have healers nearby you can alone decide in just 10 seconds of applying dots, and if youre not getting dispelled you have insane pressure. - hard to gear up in raids since shadow priests are bad in pve.   
---
For world pvp, you will have a great time too. there is no undead racial to break your fear since you are horde yourself. but you cannot kill capable healers.  
---
so for pvp i highly recommend shadow priests, they are very viable.  just join a guild and heal untill you get benediction from molten core, turn it onto anathema and leave the guild and enjoy wrecking faces in pvp
---
You can always have fun on the Zeppelin.
---
It's awesome, that you can't help yourself get money for mount that way. I usually play healer with alchemy. Selling all healing pots, mana pots, swiftness potions, fadeleaf and I'm always ready to chunk in those 90 golds.
---
People on the private servers always seem to recommend mining and skinning.   I think you keep the ore, and vendor the leather.  I am not sure if that will be the best strat for classic though.  
---
A good way to learn new professions is to pick up the gathering profession first.   Level that to max trying to get most of the mats that you need, and then switch to the profession that you want.
---
Being hit while flying to dismount would've been super sick. That'd mean you had to be careful where you went, and if you flew past the opposite faction they could dismount suicide you. Would be neat.
---
Tailoring is really important for warlocks if you're raiding
---
Updates after Classic has run its course? This is a fresh new idea I've never heard of before!
---
I didn't play between wrath and legion. Came back on launch. Had a great time and by the first major patch I was feeling a satisfying sense of progress, having just got back into raiding while being far from cutting edge. Then the patch hit and I just felt like the goal posts had been moved and I'm back on the treadmill at the start. No thanks.
---
Classic you'll be able to work away over the life of the project at your own pace and never feel like you're going backwards, at least. If you "only" clear BWL and the 20 mans in your journey, who cares? That's perfectly valid and you'll enjoy it as you should.
---
I am waiting
---
Yes it's one of those cases where they're damned if they do, damned if they don't. People would be outraged because of all the time they spent farming these mounts, buying them, etc. Yet removing them would make the game better without question. So they either watch the game slowly die like it is now, or piss off the entire remaining playerbase on a gamble by removing them.
---
Blizzard really dug their own grave here and I don't think they can ever fix it. Classic is really their opportunity to go in another direction, but we'll see.
---
The same clip but starting a few seconds earlier if you got lost like me.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CleanPoorPigeonSpicyBoy
---
This is f’ing awesome.
---
It's a particular skill but not especially difficult. If you put in the work and accept failures for what they are you'll do fine.
---
Classic Winds is actually pretty good too, and of course Preach.
---
It will always be better to update a new server with new things and see how that pans out instead of updating existing servers right away. The same goes if Blizzard decides to create TBC/Wrath servers. It'd be best if those start fresh and leave the Classic servers in their original state.
---
At the end they can have:
---
* Classic Original
---
* Classic Enhanced Progression (classic-themed updates)
---
* TBC
---
* Wrath
---
So that's 4 different flavors of servers on top of retail. All their experimental new stuff should go to the classic enhanced progress server. Same process if they want to enhance TBC/Wrath with new content.
---
Id say about 30 for majority of the classes. I leveled like 5 and most of them became really fun at around 30
---
People don’t want new content added they just want classic. The hardcore people who pushed for this have been playing on private servers of classic for way longer than 2 years. They don’t care about other expansions and really don’t want new stuff around that wasn’t in vanilla.
---
Dude I want it
---
Thanks for your insight. It's been hard to find good pvp info as someone who hasn't played wow. My guild is moving from GW2 pvp to classic and I'm the only one who hasn't played it before. I was going to roll a shadow priest but all I care about is organized pvp so I'll scrap that idea. 
---
I understand the "play what you want" mindset generally pushed here but for many of us what we want is what is optimal for our goal. So I appreciate the real insight.
---
There will be 3k people per layer, and I think they said they wanted no more than 3 layers per server?  Don't quote me on that.   If so, I think that might be a mistake.  I expect massive amounts of people to make characters, like a million or more, but many of those people will leave almost immediately.  
---
Anyways, there's no way to know how many servers there will be, because there's no way to know how many people will play.
---
Your entire sense of reality seems pretty skewed. The babysat by twitch generation.
---
There are quests in every starting area that you can complete even with infinite people. Deliver quests and stuff like that.
---
Good job, Shaggy!
---
Cheers for the reply
---
?
---
Truth and accuracy. If there were 450 people attending, the word literally is being used correctly. If there were 30, it is not.
---
The post didn't mean WoW is actual crack, it was an exaggeration, therefore it is not in the literal sense.
---
PSA to those doing NE to Elwynn, there's a tram that goes from Ironforge to stormwind. You don't want to miss it. *flashbacks*
---
You could, but there's plenty of fish that have actual value, so why would you?
---
It makes it rewarding. It's the same principle as slugging through a dungeon to finally get an update. And it's why current wow has no soul anymore. As a hunter, your first ten levels are quite the pain (even if more efficient than a lot of classes somehow), and getting your first pet feels awesome. That's not the case anymore in retail.
---
I lagged through this gate on my server's AQ gate opening day.  
---
Me and about 7-8 other people were on the inside of the gate when the gong was hit. The large sentinel trash mobs spawned behind the gate and destroyed us immediately before spilling out in Silithus.
---
Watch out for Bill. I dont trust this guy. He's going to ninja loot everything. Nobody should trust Bill.
---
Community is certainly needed but only to empower the individual. All communities are inherently selfish, they were created only to help the individual survive. That's why communities and family bonds are so weak nowadays - they aren't needed, and people aren't that interested in them. 
---
Space exploration is irrelevant, we don't even know what's inside us.
---
I don't recall it being that expensive??
---
I see "Fresh!!", "Fresh!!", "Fresh!!"  on private servers. They don't want the same thing. I wonder if Blizzard will cater to that.
---
Slowly 2
---
But was the blue set for max lvl?
---
I was like damn what I'm gonna do that afternoon then I saw the update and actual beta servers. I was like daaamn, could this be even better?! Prepared for the evening just to arrive to no servers available...
---
yes
---
It wasn't a mistake in BC. World pvp still existed at contested zones (elemental plateau for example and node areas). Saying you played a rogue and enjoyed skipping content with stealth and then saying flying mounts are bad because it gave non rogue players the ability to do is bad seems hypocritical. If anything flying mounts gave people the choice of when they wanted to fight (like stealth) and also opened more content to the game (netherwing reputation at 280% gain).
---
Speak for yourself. I’d love new Classisms inspired content like OSRS does.
---
Didn't even know he was streaming, this is fantastic. Now we get to enjoy those sultry monotones and fantastic humour live.
---
You should take some time to learn about "verisimilitude" versus "realism"
---
Just go where your buddies go
---
I dont see the importance. Can you explian it a bit?
---
I will buy SS bags.
---
I couldnt agree more, I'm so excited for classic.
---
I was 21 and in college. Played a lot of Ultima Online and SWG before getting into the beta as a Tauren shaman and was hyped. It was thanksgiving break when it released and I got to no life it for a little bit. I feel like we sucked just because we didn’t know any better. YouTube didn’t come out for another 6 months until the Janet Jackson thing happened. So it’s not like we could watch movies on strats in the beginning. Only site I sometimes used was thotbot. Elitist jerks wasn’t popular yet. I remember being on Lucifron with a blackhand doomsaw autoattacking and consecrating while throwing out like 5 heals before oom. MC was three nights a week at the start. Now it’s like 20 minutes for a speed run. We didn’t stack world buffs at all. There was no waiting to turn in ony’s neck before the next raid. 
---
Fuck, I’m hyped.
---
I was 13 I think? Give or take a year. I had no idea what a rotation was and would just spam whatever I could as a arms warrior. Once I learned about rotations my dps was much better and I got more efficient. I still sucked though lol.
---
Its not. Theyll re releae tbc and maybe wrath and so on... They wont fuck with classic theres no point in making new content for 2 games. 
---
Retail is beyond repair now i feel like. I just hope classic teaches them more about game design for future possible ips. Classic will be a blast for 2 years minimum and thats all i ever wanted honestly. I dont want them to redo shit just make something new thats as good as classic is.
---
Yeah the toxicity here towards retail is far worse
---
Yeah there's a blue set that goes up to rank 10 I think? Maybe rank 9. I got up to rank 9 and I was a semi casual player back then. You can do it casual but you'll need to make friends with the premades.
---
I was running with the guys grinding to rank 14.
---
It was a political endeavour. They would agree who would reach rank 14 for that week and then rotate and would adjust the honour earned to make sure they were at the top etc.
---
We were a low pop server on the Horde side so it was manageable
---
2 is valid when the proposition is absurd. If he said people were literally killing themselves 3 times a day because of Beta access, it would be ok.
---
Being a crackhead is perfectly possible.
---
Is there leveling starting zones that are easier to level in than others?
---
If you have the time, get your rank 10 gear and run a resto/ele hybrid to excel in both premades and world pvp. With engineering and proper use of totems and CD's you are a 1v1/1v2 god.
---
You really think fully buffed raids only reduce 20 minutes? Yikes.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jlgz48twTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jlgz48twTI)my all time favorite vanila mage pve video.   
---
Back to your question though(mage specific answer here)  your rotation is easy, and not failing on boss mechanics is obviously essential.  
---
The BIG thing about being a good raider is actually showing up on time and having repaired and bringing enough consumables.   there are 40 people in a raid, so if a handful of players waste everyones time over the course of a raid, you have significant downtimes.   please respect this to the fullest and you should be fine.
---
Yup, both sides are fucking awful :(
---
World pvp became pretty much non existent, although flying was just one factor in that. But the fact that the ganked side could just mount up and leave very quickly and easily was a big one. It's not hypocritical, because it took away something from the class identity. Saying there was flying content because there was flying is like saying there's dog food because we have dogs.. Yeah, but I would prefer to get some other form of content.
---
One thing I'll say about the leveling portion, prot is a lot slower than ret. I would recommend ret just as a quicker leveling time.
---
YEAH BUT BFA SUCKS
---
Beautiful! I love the colors!
---
That being said, you should not neglect your SO to play video games.
---
Thank you for, the information.
---
Enchanting is really only going to make you money if you spam chat to sell your services.  Keep that in mind.
---
Engineering is great for PvP, and a few instances in raiding for some classes.  Idk if warlock is one of those though.
---
Damn, looks amazing
---
Grats.  Wish I had save videos or screenshots of any sort.
---
No vanilla PvE video is complete without Godsmack, Disturbed, Papa Roach or Rise Against. You did well!
---
Ranged enemy attacks you.  
---
You can't see him.  
---
Can't charge through terrain.
---
Did they make the night less night in newer xpacs?
---
Sure you are. We cleared MC on the first week we did it, but continued to world buff for it up until AQ. It speeds it up immensely. If you want as much time on progression nights as possible or you want to make sure you finish your raids for the week in the first two days, world buffing definitely makes sense
---
That’s what happens when asmongold is the representation of alliance. That man child is a lame ass
---
Which would be midnight CEST.
---
I love this! Id even buy a print!
---
What classes are the most hectic to play?
---
On retail I was a FOTM disc and really enjoyed it but they are trash in pvp now so I’m trying shadow and it’s so much more basic.

Are there any other hectic classes that will be good for pvp in classic? Seems like Druid would be the closest comparison but they seem to be a classic pvp meme.
---
2 nights or less.
---
There were tcg rewards in vanilla, like the red ogre idol and more
---
It makes me happy to see others who are so  equally excited about it! I can’t wait to have fun with guys like you again :)
---
Well the kind of guild you talking about will be doing MC, ony, bwl in one raid night.. And that's like half a year we talking about, so not that much from the begging. The AQ will be a different though, don't have any experience with AQ, but some buddies told me they got burnt out after AQ progression.
---
Ofc. Best time to jump in.
---
Does anyone know of a list that shows all of the available mounts in classic and which race can or can't use them. Like how Tauren can't use raptors for example. The warcraftmounts website is awful to navigate and find anything.
---
Yes, once they got buffed or whatever it was for lv60s, otherwise it was for 58
---
Murloc &gt; fish/man
---
Gentlemen, would you please stop? No one does work in college anyway.
---
This looks awesome! Is this already in the beta?
---
Wait.
---
Retail atm is fucking insane, I love how most people think it caters to casuals, but BfA is fucking bonkers when it comes to preparation even for casual raids.
---
Pots and Flasks have insane mat requirements compared to Legion, Food is actually somewhat hard to farm(especially feasts) and you still have the retarded AP farm from Island Expeditions. It is even worse if you're a hardcore/semi-hardcore raider since you easily pop 60 pots/night + 2/3flasks, food and still have to grind Mythic + for titanforges on top of the AP grind.
---
Yeah, people are naive if they don't think all of the streamers will get first choice on name reservations.
---
It was! There’s plenty of videos on YouTube 12 years ago of people buying it. 
---
Skip to 5:45!
---
One for example. https://youtu.be/8FqRtccnMik
---
Blizzard emails you to let you know you're in the beta. Presumably, they also did this for the stress test.
---
Ah yeah it's to 10. 9 is just the flag or whatever, I was thinking 10 was flag and 9 was the last armor piece
---
Attack icon should show thunderfury
---
Alliance is far better in pvp.
---
When you compare the cities you should know that alliance main city is Ironforge, as its close to the Blackrock mountain. The road between kargath and orgrimmar was annoying experience for me.
---
I want to roll a warrior???
---
Yeah it's the one thing besides healthcare that the US is severely lacking
---
I think everyone will be getting gathering professions. At least a lot of them so the market will be saturated by all the gathered materials. I'd probably pick alchemy since people will be going hard on raids and always need TONS of flasks etc. for them. As well as for pvping.
---
I built a desktop for the living room, based on an i5 8th gen and GTX 1060. I recently hooked up to a 32 inch 2k display, and I get (constant)
---
* 100 FPS on Ultra with no anti-aliasing, and
---
* 60 FPS on Ultra + max anti-aliasing. 
---
That includes random BGs, and dungeon pugs. 
---
Your Laptop will be fine. Just make sure your hard-drive is an SSD to avoid long loading times. :-)
---
You mean first time in a long time you've actually watched pvp then. Any arena stream and you will find skill.
---
So do we know if anything is actually gonna be changed for classic wow compared to original vanilla wow? Any balance changes, are they gonna keep updated graphics and models etc?
---
[HotW spec (1/29/21)](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxxbscRdLVxsoxo). The one point in nature's grasp can be swapped to 5/5 hearth of the wild if desired, but I find NG handy in pvp.
---
You'll be able to effectively tank and heal given you have invested the time to acquire two sets of gear. I've been watching a lot of Ebn, Skarm and Shedo and Stormx and they're amazing druids and offer great insight into how to play the hybrid role effectively...because how many classes can say they can heal AND tank in the same raid and not have to respec constantly like other healing classes to farm effectively.
---
Joining for classic will be enjoyable. Joining normal retail now, not so much.
---
Skinning is by far the easiest, but I suspect that a lot of people will be leveling it, so you will probably be best off to vendor your leather.
---
August 20th for me. 
---
Linear Algebra
---
Physics
---
Theory Programming Languages
---
Linux/UNIX Programming
---
Look on the bright side, just think of the rested experience you'll have :/
---
Classic is going back to the start so its the best time to start for story wise and so you dont feel like you need to catch up. Best part about fresh servers!
---
You could pick it up ez pz. Biggest tip I'd say is line of sight pulling is the best thing ever.
---
Yes. You had to work to get your equipment. When I first hit level 40 on my warrior, I had enough gold for my mount, but not enough for my plate training. I had given up my ability to wear plate until level 42, just so that I could ride my mount. Also, you had to actually plan and work as a team to defeat the bosses. Nowadays, people rush everything, blame everybody else if they fail, and disband the party.
---
really interesting how one says "you're not a 1v1 class" and you say "you are 1v1/1v2 god".  Probably goes to show that the skill ceiling with shammy is pretty high
---
Shamans have too many tools to be an easy target for mana draining. Earth Shock and Grounding Totem will take care of casts. Both poison cleansing totem and the regular cleansing poison spell on cast will remove Viper Sting before it gets to drain even once.
---
Then there are items to help you even further if this isn't enough. It takes more effort than it's worth to mana drain a Shaman. On the CC side, they do bring plenty of soft CC just not hard CC outside of items.
---
It is
---
They broke it in the BC Pre patch where they introduced the new 41 point talents.
---
It does happen in the Classic beta. It happens to Asmongold all the time on stream.
---
Warlocks don't have any threat reducing abilities in vanilla I don't think? So yeah they're one of the dps classes that can't just go hard and use some skill/talent to reduce/drop agro.
---
You do, or a /reload
---
The plot thickens.
---
That's a good way to look at it and certainly makes me consider the class more!
---
Thanks for the insight :)
---
You should just go with your buddies in my honest opinion. When you have group of friends. All the group quests, dungeons are easier. And imagine farming the pre-bis things. Let's say you want Cape of the barron from start UD. you're buddies and you run this dungeon every day, because you want it. When you run it with your buddies, once one guy gets it then it's your turn. Meanwhile when you're playing alone, there will be always atleast two people who wants the Cape + tank maybe....because there is not really a reason for tank to run start besides the Cape.
---
Simply another faster ground mount and a speed increase on flight paths. You take flight paths to cover long distance quickly and after that you use your very fast ground mount. That way, you still can afk to cover long distances, but once you want to travel inside a zone, you are on the ground with everyone!
---
Are you a masochist? If yes, welcome to the club. If no, reroll.
---
And I've never been more proud of the WoW community for standing up to the purist rubbish Blizzard was pushing. Stop trying to take away things people like. Flying is nowhere near as bad as the hyperventilating on this sub makes it out to be.
---
I love watching Esfand and StaySafe, McConnell makes my ears bleed.  Not a big fan of him.  Wish I didnt have to hear him chirping all the damn time
---
He also looted Thunderfury from a spider 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
14 at the start, I remember being 15-16 and applying to guilds any lying about my age so I could raid.
---
Pretty sure tauren could only ride kodos and wolves unless they get the mounts that drop from bosses
---
&gt;But there's no logical reason why that would be the case.
---
Again, the people making the decisions are human, and it's part of human nature.  I'm not sure why you are in denial about this.
---
&gt;your aversion to each change that they make should be on the basis of the merits and demerits of the change itself, not because of other changes that you think could follow
---
You aren't understanding.
---
Imagine you are with ten friends at a pizza place and you're going to share a big pizza.  Your favorite pizza pepperoni, but you also love cheese pizza.  You hate all other pizza toppings.  You also hate half and half pizzas.
---
You and your friends all like cheese pizza, and the assumption had sort of been that's what you'd order.  But then your friend Bob says, "hey, a few of us love pepperoni, let's do that"
---
This sounds good right?  Pepperoni is your favorite.  Bob's too.  So you say OK.  Well, now Dave speaks up.  He wants sausage on the pizza.  He says, well, if you get to add a topping so do I.  You try to go back to cheese, but Bob says great, let's do pepperoni and sausage!  Bob likes both.  In fact, it turns out that a good portion of the table likes all sorts of individual toppings.  Debate ensues on which toppings will be added.  Now, what are the odds you're going to get a pizza you don't hate?  Pretty slim.
---
Same thing with changes in WoW.  We have a product that most people can agree is good.  You might think that if you start tweaking it, you'll only get the changes *you* want, and nothing else, when really, there are a bunch of people that want different changes than you.
---
In the end, it's just not worth the risk.  Stick with the cheese pizza.  If you go for the pepperoni, sure, maybe everyone will decide on that... But it's not likely.
---
No in Beta the night is from BFA actually ( in my opinion )
---
Thank you. Very usefull, gonna keep that bookmarked.
---
Yes???
---
Syllabus week, bruh
---
Doom of Impending Skull
---
How about going support paladin? half healing half damage w/tier 1 set.
---
Yeah i was thinking alchemy and herb, and maybe blacksmith/mining on an alt if i can be bothered levelling
---
The Vanilla server I played on it seemed both IF and SW were pretty popular. IF more so but SW had a decent population around the clock.
---
If you're not careful with it, a bent staff could easily become an executor staff.
---
yes they were.
---
Plus you are an amazing tank in 5mans! Especially with that shortage of tanks that can never seem to get filled.
---
And what's this? The group has a tank but needs heals? Well, you can do that too!
---
And more often than not, there's usually going to be a shaman or priest in the party that can handle ooc rez :).
---
Your complaint seems to be that we here in America get it “later” somehow as it’s in the afternoon.  Apart from the fact that global means everyone gets it at the same time everywhere there’s also the fact that we’re getting it the day BEFORE the actual “launch” date as a result.  If you wanted to wait till midnight on launch day you still can.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "do this"
---
Wtf same
---
Understanding threat and how much threat your abilities do is fairly straight forward. Straight tanking isn't especially difficult.   
---
The things a good tank will have to master is pulling as others have said. Understanding how to move bosses and where to position everything will be key to good raids. Watching videos ahead of time is mandatory. And lastly and most importantly is you will need to react and act when something goes wrong. You have the most power in a group to prevent a wipe if you can bring an uncontroled situation back under control.
---
Druids are good flagcarriers, can be super strong 1v1 or even 1v2 in solo world pvp depending on the matchup, and you're never gonna be caught dead in the open world. Nobody can catch you.
---
I'd say they're all worth doing especially if you can get quests around the level you are for them. Often gives you a huge boost in xp/some decent items.
---
I think as long as you get into a raiding guild that has a more casual approach to raiding it wont be an issue.... or if you're in a more hardcore raiding guild you'll just have to accept that you'll always be lower priority for being geared up due to your lower raiding time compared to the "core" raiders 🤷‍♂️
---
Why not gnome to piss people off with your size and hideous /laugh?
---
I love these, they are brilliant!
---
I would wager that the % of users that actually writes manual reports is low enough that it wouldn't matter. The main thing that makes it stink right now is that they keep inviting "influencers" but don't give a chance to regular people, and this is after they said you needed a sub to be considered. People are going to get mad very soon, I give it a week.
---
can it be dispelled?  does dispell try to dispell it, if not?
---
Here’s the best list:
---
Do the rogue class quest at 10 for the green dagger.
---
Do the poison quest at 20 asap because it’s a huge damage boost. 
---
Do the Mauradon quest for Thrash Blade at 45-50. You will use this weapon for a very long time. Rogues clear MC with this weapon. 
---
That’s it. Yes you can do the SM and RFD quests at 30 for a better sword. But imo it’s not worth it if you want to level fast. Up to you.
---
Dude I failed my statistics class too.  2017 though.
---
You must be playing a different retail than me? There is almost no preparation for raids.. Pots, flask and food are dirt cheap and that's it. I assure you, the bare minimum for raids in classic is gonna be more than that.
---
One of the best guilds at the time. The mage "Fura" was a pioneer when it came to making kill videos in Vanila.  Legends, all of them.   
---
This video inspired me to get into raiding, and still gives me goosebumps to this day.
---
It's literally 4,05.
---
"I'm sure someone's gonna clip that"   
---
L0L
---
This is a really great 21:9 setup. I've missed great, minimal UIs which were prevalent in WOW back in the day.
---
I think the only thing I'd change (and only for leveling) is moving the mini-map low center and putting the action bars on either side.
---
are implying others haven't found any major issue? Just look at the 3 page report on the flight paths yesterday!! game breaking stuff
---
That's what I figured too. I don't like to miss raids so probably best I try to find a guild that raids 2-3 nights per week and matches my schedule.
---
This is why I constantly drink Inky Black potions!
---
It's in pretty rough shape at the moment. Lots of missing info, reminders to add stuff, etc. I haven't worked on it in a while. I'll try and get it finished and post a copy of it soon. (:
---
Oof my data
---
I quit playing in Heavensward so I didn't even know they'd removed Stoneskin. Back when I was playing it was relatively common for unsynced Scholars to cast Adlo on whoever was tanking the FATE, and it would have precisely the effect you describe.
---
Watching that game unfold really has been like watching WoW's expansion history unfold in fast forward. ARR was already pretty far down the modern WoW street, but they've taken it even further with every subsequent expansion while putting their own terrible twists on the formula (eg. barely releasing any endgame content because releasing dumb minigames and more mounts and cosmetics is more profitable/popular). I hate it.
---
You didn’t exactly say in the title it was continuous did you? If it doesn’t disappear then yes you’re correct, THIS IS NOT VANILLA... I REPEAT, NOT VANILLA!!!
---
 Looking for a guild to level up and raid with. Nothing to hardcore. Plan to level a warrior and will go prot at max level. Only looking at guilds based on Oceanic Servers. Never played Vanilla. Started when BC came out. Gave up on wow after cata. Started playing on a private server recently to get back into the game. Just waiting for classic to launch. Looking for some laid back adults to grind and raid with.
---
* Australia/Oceanic Servers only
---
* Intended server type? IDC really, I won't spend much time doing PVP unless someone is trying to gank me. I only care about PVE
---
* Alliance only
---
* Most Mornings and Evenings on weekdays - Can't play on weekends though. (Australia Central Time)
---
* Mostly PVE rolling prot warrior
---
* No kid guilds please
---
* Discord/reddit for contact
---
Scheduled a few weeks off from work to make some serious progress in early game before toning things down.
---
I wasn’t big on any of the large streamers, but Esfand really does know how to maximize his pally play. He can really wreck face and know exactly what to do at certain times.
---
Best class to choose with a heavy wPvP mindset with raid progression and/or dungeon running in the future? Stuck between Warlock, Warrior, and Hunter.
---
Not at all! Why are you offended?
---
Imagine being so enraged that you respec your priest to shadow and fly all the way out there and still die. lmao
---
maybe he means unarmored mounts in retail
---
No balance changes. Some graphical changes. Some quality of life changes.  Will run on the retail client and not on the old one, but all in all pretty much as it was.
---
Yeah a lot of people, me included, didn't want to play pservers cuz they are buggy and not permanent. Plus the even higher amount of people that'll be starting for the first time, or who started late, or...
---
would need event/combat log.  can spell fail?
---
Very true. For instance Esfand/Asmons guild that I play in is at max 1000 people. Out of those maybe 9 are streamers big enough to be called a streamer. They constantly kick inactive people to make way for more random people. 
---
You’re being an entitled brat and you’re making up a narrative that fits your ill informed butt hurt karma expedition. Not a good look, your mother is proud I bet.
---
Of course casual raiding exists. Thousands and thousands of players are going to be playing like us who have reduced time to raid and will eventually clear the content buddy.
---
Which wouldn’t have any impact on classic whatsoever, so his comment is rather pointless either way
---
No. You need tunes to teleport as well. Rune of teleportation
---
This is correct.
---
AM/PM, inches, feet, yards, fucking pounds, fahrenheit for weather.
---
I don't understand americans.
---
I was so surprised how the servers are nicely balanced on private vanilla realms after coming from retail where you have basically all one faction realms(besides defies brotherhood).
---
try grinding on some mobs that aren't too much higher than you
---
Can't read this on mobile, anyone have a better version?
---
Hardcore guilds raid less than casual guilds. Hardcore guilds don’t need more than 1 night to clear the content.
---
That's a great painting! Same here, and having wowclassiccountdown.com in the background 🤣🤣
---
Problem is people get in line like the lemmings they are. If you’re putting a 5 man together and you pick up a ret. unless you’re the tank, someone will make a stink that you picked up a subpar role when you could have spent 30 more seconds to get literally anyone else.
---
And believe me, this is from someone who has played ret late game on private servers. I made groups and constantly had to refill members who dropped because they were with ret.
---
Yes. I started on private servers.
---
Like he said, for gear, spam dungeons. It helps with a few things, gear for doing more dps/healing/mitigation but also for the resist gear, like fire resist for MC. On top of that you will learn you class better in a group setting, specially when you do a 10 man ;).
---
Gaming in couch is not good when playing FPS games due to you having your mouse beside you on the couch (need a hard mousepad). But games like wow are excellent couch games. Just buy some kind of laptop pad for having on your knees to put your laptop on to avoid cooling issues and you are good to go.
---
I remember reading that in 1.12 the cool down was going to be 12 hours, but the wowhead and classicdb website show no cool down and other non “genuine” sources say 2-hours.  Could not find an official blue post source.  I’ll dig deeper later and see if I can find the where I found the 12-hour cool down in 1.12.
---
easy tier gear, that's for sure but some of it isn't that much better than some pre-raid bis stuff, even from phase 1. It's also nice to pick up offset gear as a tank because not a lot of people need that either :)
---
2edgy4me
---
&gt; You're making a huge mistake if...
---
Vanila is the best representative of the MMORPG genre by far.   modern WoW has lost the charm that vanila gave the Genre.   unique items, random epic drops from mobs across the world, and dangers lurking around every corner. it is a masterpiece that must be experienced
---
It's definitely playable by casuals, but they'll reach 60 slower and might not be able to raid all the content considering gathering and maintaining a steady amount of consumables costs a lot more effort than anything in retail atm.
---
Yeah, I am jealous of you actually.
---
Fuck off with your addon. We didn't need it then. We don't need it now
---
I never got to play classic and I had no idea until recently that pservers are even a thing. But everything I read about classic tells me it’s perfect this this middle aged gal. I would love to start leveling some characters on a vanilla server to see what classes I like. Would you mind saying which server you on?
---
This actually made me smile. Let the motherfucking assholes bash it as much as they want, because they won't be playing with us in the first place. Let them waste away their free time bashing Classic, while we stay in the game actually having fun.
---
Hurts Even more when you have improved overpower
---
Next time you link a manchild screaming at the top of his lungs straight into a microphone, tag it with an according warning.
---
That's really cute and doesn't overly scream 'gamer'!   
---
I know this is super cliche but I would buy it.
---
Alchemy and herb is definitely the go-to moneymaker. Keep in mind that you will have to run Scholomance in order to craft flasks though, as they require an Alchemy Lab.
---
It's a video game though
---
I don't know mate, you'll probably end up having main character and then maybe farming alt. That's it, there is so much needed to be done, that you don't have time to maintain more than one character.
---
You do know that this game was almost everyones intro to the genre, right? 
---
I think he will be more than fine.
---
intant gratification kiddies.  you should feel weak in the beginning and grow stronger
---
Warrior is the class for you.
---
Man that's kinda rude, can't let people enjoy the little things.
---
And what do you mean by "You'll just use your current account and download that crap on the launcher as will the rest of us."? *Of course* i'll go play classic, what's your point?
---
Day before launch date? U wot?
---
Tell them that the alliance has gnomes. That'll seal the deal.
---
From the 1.3.0 patch notes (Dire Maul):
---
All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.
---
With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:
---
* Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members
---
* Blackrock Spire - 15 members
---
* Dire Maul - 5 members
---
All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange. In addition, will have their loot improved significantly for the next content patch.
---
spirit visage, warmog’s, randuin’s + 2 ruby crystals
---
i mean clearly he’s a tank since he looted thunder fury off a spider. doesn’t every warrior tank in classic build those items?
---
You do not want to level resto.   Vanilla isn't like the current iteration of the game where the healers can put out some dps too.  It will take you so long to kill stuff that it will require your whole mana bar just to kill one mob.  
---
Level up enhancement is probably best, but you can do elem if you want.  Switching to elem after you are 40 is supposedly decent.   You can heal just fine with either spec, if you keep some healing gear.
---
As far as professions go, I don't think LW will do much for you.
---
Maybe once on farm status, I don't imagine this being the case for new content releases
---
This looks like it should be sold at Pier 1 Imports.
---
Hey there I would play the warrior because it’s going to make you mad when your trying to find a group and looking for a tank for 10-30minutes with no luck.
---
What a shitty Video
---
They do. Demonology Warlocks can spec into 20% reduced threat from the Master Demonologist talent, although it requires that you have your imp out.
---
Because it is closed to Blackrock mountain and close to the boats. Not sure if this is the reason, but that's why I found myself always in IF... And I really like stormwind city btw.
---
They should just abandon all expansions with flying mounts and build upon the vanilla experience
---
Which branch of engineering is better for PVE raiding (ie. goblin or gnomish)? Does it differ between classes? I'll be rolling rogue if that makes a difference. Thx in advance.
---
They made most NPCs immune to Mind Control. You unfortunately will not be able to replicate this video.
---
Oh you’re in a for a surprise.
---
The “launch date” is August 27th.  As a global release we will get it August 26th at 3pm PST.  If it wasn’t a global release we’d get it at 12:00 AM PST August 27th.  It’s not rocket science.
---
I feel for you. Classic has come at the perfect time for me, graduating in June or I'd be fucked
---
Tbc Pala buffs??
---
Nobody tanks as prot..
---
Since you seem to be way out of the loop:
---
"Red makes it go fasta" is a thing in the Warhammer40k universe where the orks have a strange ability to make things be real as long as enough of them believe it is. One of the things they believe is red paint on vehicles makes it go faster, so it goes faster.
---
You dont have to worry about laptop performance, you will play at max quality without lagging.  a laptop in 2004/2005 was enough for me to play the game, and i only dropped fps in 80 man fights in alternac valley.  my phone could probably handle it today.    
---
you can easily play on a laptop, but if you want improved performance just plug a keyboard into the laptop
---
People getting mad about "streamer privilege" is like people getting mad that women have doors held open for them.
---
Ah, interesting. I assumed there would be balance changes, weren't some specs for some classes not viable at all in endgame?
---
Well since it's 13 per cent priests on horde and alliance, it's about he same number of paladins and priests in alliance. And way less druids.
---
That is a problem warriors are going to have i think
---
Their dungeon role and raid role will often not the same, which I guess a lot aren’t prepared for, since a lot probably planned for one spec or the other
---
Meaning you won't use your battlechest to install the game.
---
Not sure what we can tell you that you don't already know. If you've played both classes extensively on PServers, you've got all the experience you need to make an informed decision. You know the ups and downs of both classes, so pick the one you like more? They're both popular classes (arguably the top two) and will be needed in raids and premades. 
---
I guess if I had to pick pros for each class:
---
* Warriors will find groups easier *if* you're willing to tank
---
* Mages are easier to level
---
* Mages are cheaper/quicker to pre-raid BiS
---
* Mages can farm much more efficiently
---
* Mages can easily PvP in their PvE spec
---
* Mages will never be asked to tank (if that's not your thing)
---
Mild #edgelord post don’t let it bother you
---
played wc2 battle net edition.
---
From the 1.10.0 patch notes (D2 sets added):
---
Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.
---
I couldn't agree more. Modern WoW managed to become both underwhelming and exhausting at the same time. It feels more like a free to play phone game, since it is not being designed to be fun, but to keep people "engaged" and spending money.
---
Bob Ross this painting or GTFO my subreddit! :P
---
In vanilla nobody duels outside of SW because everyone hangs out in IF.
---
Guess I haven't played private servers enough. Are guilds clearing bwl, aq40 and naxx first night?
---
awesome job!!! want this lol
---
And the answer is mage
---
Alliance cities are conveniently located for end game content. Paladin buffs make end game easier. We are clearly better.
---
WHO CARES!
---
heals(1)/tank(2) here. I know I'll primarily be slotted to heal in raids but that's why I aim to collect a tank set on the side so I can tank dungeons effectively and maybe even raids who knows. Skarm, Ebn, Taladril and Stormx are all great inspiration for playing druid, I'd go check them out.
---
Threat is major issue for Horde Warlocks. You are not going to get around that. If you are lucky and get a Shaman in your group, you get Tranquil Air Totem for reduced threat. 
---
The class is definitely worth playing despite the threat issues. Plus it will make you appreciate a good tank even more.
---
Playing 20 hours a week, it will take most people about 3 months to hit 60. (= 10 days /played)
---
Not at all
---
So how do I manage alts whenever classic hits?
---
My experience from Vanilla was kind of the opposite.
---
My first level 60 was a mage. Why? My older brother and his friends said it was good, so I chose that. But around level 40, I started my night elf warrior alt. Still focused on the mage, got him to 60, pre raid gear, got into a guild that was running MC, and honestly found mage to be incredibly boring.
---
In my head, when it came to raiding, all a mage did was spam frostbolt, and a warriors job was much more involved. Since raiding was my main focus, it was an easy choice.
---
Almost as soon as my warrior hit around 55, I knew warrior was much better suited for me, and basically benched my mage, only briefly bringing him out for alt raids.
---
I like how a warrior has 3 (at least) strong playstyles, in 2h MS, dual wield fury, or the super tank. I leveled as 2h MS, went prot at 60, and eventually towards AQ40, became a high end fury warr, which is VERY fun for me.
---
All that being said, I think if you feel like you prefer mage more, I'd level that first, and use your rested exp to slowly level up a warrior. If you're going to sell Ony pugs down the road, your first char doesnt need to be a tank, there will be plenty of time for that.
---
Nah, shes the bread winner and she bought me a new F-150, so I'd say I won.
---
There’s going to be try-hard dickheads.  There’s just no getting around that.  There’ll be rogues that camp the under-leveled and people who won’t invite you to kill the elite because you are one level below what they want.  That’s just how some people play the game.  You can find ways to enjoy the game despite their presence.  There’s good and bad eggs just like in real life.
---
Link isn't working for me
---
Taladril is my dude, love his treatise on bear tanking.
---
It's the best time for sure. You get to see the game before they ruined it with casual crap.
---
BWL in 50 minutes. 
---
AQ under 2 hours
---
Naxx under 3 hours. 
---
I expect these numbers to drop further because I believe that Classic raiding will be easier than on private servers who overtune their raids.
---
It's a bug, it should add the crosshairs once. But it constantly replays the animation. The arrow above your head works like it should
---
Why is he screaming? Did he expect something different? Dont get it
---
Go to the forms and complain. Then ask for free game time.
---
Uhhhhh lmao
---
Uhhhh lmao
---
The pservers are rife with racism, homophobia, bigotry, and idiocy. A lot of those asshats will get banned for the stuff they get away with there, not sure about seeing that stuff on this sub tho?
---
When vanilla came out I had real life responsibilities as did many people, but it's the fact that you have to wait longer for your big upgrades that makes you enjoy it more and also take in the whole experience with the game. I think the potential to make friends and enjoy moments with other people along with the slow progression will make for a much more satisfying experience overall tc.
---
Yup. No changes though because you can't make everything viable
---
Same. I'm tanking
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
Sorry you weren't able to reply directly to the threads that prompted this thread.
---
I'll have to adjust my PTO! Thanks 😎
---
I love these posts.
---
Enchanting. If you can get some popular recipes like fiery or crusader, they are going to last as moneymakers for as long as you play classic. Like, never being short on cash moneymakers.
---
Firstly he should have used nades to be able to intercept the rogue. What about using shield and tank gear vs rogue? This is the best way to secure a win. Furthermore, the way he tries to escape the kiting is retarded. I've played with and vs perplexity and i know he is top tier rogue but trying to get out of this situation by running in the same direction the rogue is kiting you through the whole duel indicates that he has zero or not enough experience as warrior vs rogue in vanilla, genius.
---
There you go then. Paladins all the way down.
---
Ahh ok, ty. I wish, but my comp doesn't even have a cd-drive.
---
That gets expensive after a while. Besides you gotta save for that mount
---
Thank god, these threads always make me feel like the game was full of children. I mean, more power to them but where have all the older generation gone?!
---
The Eastern Kingdoms look really anxious! 
---
Love it
---
There was a time when none of us had experience. And what a time it was!
---
Demon Hunter....duh
---
There are still people on the other side of the screen. Just because the interaction is online doesn't make it not real.
---
I think the outside world having less relevant gear in TBC had a more significant impact on world pvp in TBC. The TBC pvp zones were massive failures and never provided enough incentive or the engaging gameplay to get players involved. The majority of world pvp in tbc involved killing the other faction outside of dungeons/raids, griefing people queuing with the world arena masters, and random nodes/mobs. 
---
Compare all of TBC’s world content to just Silithus in vanilla and you would understand that flying didn’t kill world pvp. Other changes in game design namely less engaging gameplay, rewards and relevant content were the real nails in the coffin. Flying definitely contributed to a decrease in world pvp because it makes travel so much safer. With a little creativity flying could have been made more dangerous with the addition of more flying mobs or weather effects. If the ground had substantial enough rewards to incentivize large groups of people to fight over them you would have more people on the ground. Another solution would be to make tracking spells for ore or herbs not work while mounted on a flying mount, or limit the range of the aura.
---
Weird, but I'm feeling same. I enjoyed every class I've chosen so far. Maybe we just love the game overall.
---
But giving them beta means no more of these sublime renditions. :(
---
ewww do you kiss girls or something?
---
It would be interesting to see the perspective of someone who never played vanilla. What they think about it. Has she played retail?
---
“Finally killed Rags” but someone has a TF; the facts don’t lie.
---
There is no shimmering flats anymore. Now it is a party on a houseboat
---
Ony head buff?
---
When I first played in 2005 I was 9 years old I didn't have a sub, I would make those 10 day free trial accounts over and over and see how far I could get in a week. I think my record was level 14. When I finally got a sub thanks to my parents about 6 months later, it took me about 3 months to get to level 30 on my tauren hunter.
---
So yea age was a factor.
---
BfA has some of the best levelling experiences of any expac so you've got no excuse there
---
Got any advice for healing? I've never played a healer before.
---
We're talking about mages though.
---
Every day is a day off when you're a remote employee.
---
keywords; good-windfury-procs.
---
When it hits, it's amazing but 100% of the time, you're disappointed when it doesn't. It's like playing ogre magi in dota 2 in a way.
---
It really depends on two things: 1 - are you raiding, and 2 - how many hours are you playing.
---
If you’re raiding and trying to progress you’ll need to spend time collecting materials and farming gold etc, how much depends on your skill level and how your guild is doing, but this maintenance work takes time. If you don’t play a lot, you’ll probably need to stay on one character.
---
If you play a lot, then you can level your alt and possibly do some of the prep work for raiding on the alt which can be a time saver. You can also PvP on the alt to slowly get it some gear. 
---
If you don’t raid, then you can do whatever you want on your alts because it just won’t matter all that much.
---
Not even if you open it and zoom? I'm reading it on my mobile now.
---
Warlock.   You fear people into mobs that start beating the shit out of them.  Even if they kill you, they'll die too, unless it's a rogue or hunter.
---
Okay thanks for the info.  I am somewhat of a top of the charts guy but I kinda already did the hardcore dps in wotlk and I really want to play a heavy utility class this time so I'm fine with being middle of the pack.
---
Actually I ve found hunter really good in terms of gameplay. One of the most interesting pve rotations, micro management of the pet etc. And since Hunters are not that great dps wise, it was very fascinating to over dps classes you shouldn't over dps :D
---
So epic.  This is the kinda stuff I remember from early raiding.  I'm an experienced backend MMOG developer and I am still super impressed at how incredibly well balanced a lot of the final boss fights were against a full 40 man raid.  That is such an amazing accomplishment on Blizzard's part and they must have had some insane simulation code to tune it that well.  If they just tuned it based on something less than some very sophisticated statistical modeling, all the more impressive.
---
Its all part of their master plan.
---
I have never had this problem on retail, but it was happening to me constantly during the first stress test
---
a lot of responses - 
---
2.3 was the tbc dungeon nerf patch.  anything 2.0-2.2 should almost without exception be identical to 1.12 values for dungeons.  
---
Even using 2.3-2.4 values should prove informative and is worth documenting.  ditto 3.x
---
Guilds were clearing BWL in 50 mins on the first try?
---
Hah I'm in danger
---
Sometime (around 1.04?) they swapped the mount price with the riding price. 100% Riding used to be 100g, and the mounts 900g. They changed it to 900g for riding skill and 100g for the mounts so you could collect more than one easily. 
---
If I recall this was the same patch they removed the unarmored versions of the 100% mounts. 
---
I am unsure if this change also happened for the frostsaber. I never bothered to grind it out.
---
Tried, it's all blurry.
---
If I roll warrior, and grind r14, wpvp and bg pvp is huge to me, if I went gnome for EA, how much of a downfall would that be for my dps in raids without sword skill? I should still be able to compete for top 3 dps right?
---
Ah fair. I can’t remember how expensive respeccing is but i guess I’ll do something fairly hybrid until later levels
---
The post history on this one is...illuminating
---
I feel like a reason they didn't give keys to the masses is so that tourists wouldn't burn our before the actual release.
---
I'd prefer gnome to human for EA, as a lot of classes have a slow and it would basically counter a frost mage, which we all know is a warriors demise.
---
I'm honestly dumbfounded how you can watch that and conclude I was 'a clicker'. 
---
I do recall how toxic it was in 2005, and before, since I've been among online communities since Bulletin Boards and Prodigy introducing chat rooms. It wasn't. There were only tiny subsets of the internet where toxicity would brew and spread.
---
You could turn your mount into a reindeer during the Christmas event.
---
The issues - 
---
Net dps vs. players per pull feels too low, presents very limited danger, often requires very little  healing (a red flag, in my opinion).  At the same time, for the most part mob damage per hit seems in line.
---
Assumption - Each pull of a group of chained mobs should initially do certain range of dps vs. players no matter how perfectly played.  How could this dps be  stealth reduced without changing damage numbers?
---
Answer - slight adjustment to swing timer/internal cast cooldowns on mobs.
---
This would be substantially harder to test/compare, and would generate similar damage integers per hit.
---
I just thought about it myself yesterday, when I carved out time to finish an event quest line in FFXIV (I'm playing it till Classic launches). I wasn't able to play for almost 3 weeks due to RL stuff, and I feel I'm getting behind with every single week, cause I couldn't complete weekly cheeklists to make my main class (and other classes) stronger. But at least in FFXIV they include old content in daily/weekly activities (and also events), so I can complete everything in time and eventually get all the achievments (except for PvP seasons, but I'm not an avid PvP'er).
---
Considering it was literally the start of the the game, yes I would say that Classic would be worth playing.  Most folks on this sub had their first experience in Vanilla WoW, so you would be in the same boat just 15 years later.
---
Yes please! Emerald dream and grim batol here we come!
---
I was 15. Sure, I sucked at first, it was my first MMO and one of my first "stat based" RPGs. I was actually pretty good once I learned the game so I wouldn't say my sucking had to do with age, but rather lack of knowledge.
---
I had *so* many late boozy laugh-filled nights with my friends/guildies.  It's hard to even explain to people how social it was.  I always called Tuesday nights "bowling night", because when I was a kid, my own dad has his once-a-week bowling team and would go out for 3-4 hours, socialize with family and friends in a half-serious bowling league and get a little soused.
---
It was the closest thing my generation had.
---
I'm looking forward to playing Classic again as a 51 year old!
---
There are different strats for each boss requiring a variety of potions, techniques and specs. Most soloable bosses are able to be done with minimal gear/enchant requirements which is part of what makes it enticing to farm for potential upgrades. For instance Baron Aquinas (Horde only for the Outlaw Sabre) can be done at the same level as the quest (Amongst the Ruins spawns BA who drops the globe) with a frost protection potion, heath pot and popping evasion after the protection pot wears off.
---
Sooo stuff you can easily find on databases?
---
You come off as a major prick by the way.
---
better yet. hamstring misses

Vato locon corriendo 😂😂😂

You're clicking for this whole fight --- the tooltips are popping up.

You skip all the trash so its much faster

It's soooo handy to have that spreadsheet and his ideas about druid tanking all done, ready to go.
---
Parried by a critter
---
WHAT!?!?!
---
Life is 10% what happens and 90% how you react to it
---
It's not how it was in vanilla though.
---
I'd Layer
---
Yeah you’re right they both cost a reagent, my mistake.
---
As a mage, fuck MoP. Maintenance buffs (RoP in particular) were fucking awful and challenge mode having been terrible for scaling specs (because locked ilvl) made me a sad fire mage.
---
Plus all the dungeons were fucking TERRIBLE, full of shitty gimmicks and utterly cringeworthy jokes scattered throughout them (same goes for the entire leveling experience)
---
MoP had a decent way to handle content updates (patch progression) outside of the month long SoO grind and it introduced what would later become M+ (so dungeons that stay relevant). The raids were kinda okay-good. But outside of that I am not too fond of the expansion.
---
Cata on the other hand revived BGs with rbgs, had some of the most memorable dungeons, really cool zones and leveling... Tbh the downfall of cata to me came completely after the HC dungeon nerfs. Heroics were suddenly dull gameplay wise and LFR was introduced. Biggest two blunders of Cata. Not entirely sure why the people who asked for that garbage are unhappy with the exp, though.
---
Yeah my T2 warrior might not have killed you quick, but he'd kill you eventually. Later I had dual hakkari warblades and vindicators...much more fun.
---
How does making money from enchanting work in classic?
---
Dude must be in serenity now
---
Were you on a pvp server?
---
I have no developer experience but i 100% agree.  I belive they had to tune down ragnaros a little bit one time, but they nailed it.
---
Absolutely, just avoid the trashpile that Batttle for azeroth is.
---
I've never seen someone post about TBC and talk about MMO elements. They always mention encounters, class design, etc. These are in every RPG whether you discuss single player, multiplayer, mmo, etc.
---
TBC introduced many new design decisions that would forever and irrevocably change how rewarding it is to play and how valuable community is. Flying is often mentioned, but also many classes and specs became incrementally stronger. Everyone got buffed and mobs did not. Leveling was a joke in TBC compared to classic. The old world was left to die. Horde and alliance were placed into same capital. Faction rivalry is dead as you can see each other but not kill. You fly from point to point so your paths never cross. In arena, you fight alliance v alliance and horde v horde. Meanwhile, ironforge is empty. Everyone leveling 1-60 is leveling in ghost zones empty, which used to be thriving and alive. The world died as we went from a 50 zone world to 7-10 zone worlds each expansion. We hop to the next island/world and discard the previous. It is lazy, bad design.
---
In this subreddit, we talk about the world, community, etc. is what we miss. We have great raids today by 2006 standards. What we have lost is far more important.
---
This is worse than I imagined.
---
I never played Pat TBC, but I always found vanilla the perfect game to lose yourself.  You could rush to 60, you could show roll it. You could focus on professions.  You could fish.  You could rep grind. You could PvP.  You can play for months, of not years, and still have things to do.  Each feels just as rewarding
---
He reminds me of Joe Pera.
---
Gotta get that 8% PvE yellow hitcap my dude.
---
May want to update your mount image to prevent confusion. Classic is going with cheap training and expensive mounts.
---
There will be tons of casual guilds though that will not require consumes and honestly you can progress through MC and BWL with a minimal amount of farming. It's really only hardcore guilds that will expect you to have consumes.
---
The amount of talented people on this sub.... I just spam macros...
---
What do you do once you have reached max level? I have played fair amount of MMOs (ESO, FFXIV, BFA) but I never run out of stuff because I joined pretty late.
---
How's SoulSoBreezy doing? I haven't watched his stuff in a long time (or really anyone doing WoW content) but I remember he at least started out pretty well.
---
I miss Hayven Games. He was my favorite :(
---
Bump for later insteresting conversations on vanilla future. Thanks for the thought, might be bound to this :/
---
I envy you. Being able to walk into this world without any prior experience is something you only ever get one opportunity to do. For many that was 15 years ago. 
---
Everyone will be playing it. Its so far removed from the current game that you won't be significantly disadvantaged. However the mechanics at the time were quite simple compared to the fights we have today.
---
I started a few years ago on a pserver without ever playing wow and it’s my favorite game now.
---
Funny how this NPC has Windfury Weapon (called Trash, randomly doing 2 extra attacks).
---
Warrior is fun
---
So, we could not decide what to play yet and my partner said "let's try dot voting as we do in scrum boards" and here we are. Final decision Human Paladin and Dwarf Priest
---
You mean in late august?
---
Rogue you want to get gnomish at least, so you can have the battle chicken
---
youre a bitch kid lmao
---
If someone saying "ah fuck this is retarded" offends you ... I don't know how to tell you politely to get off your high horse and don't take that shit personally. Replace that word with gay and it's the same thing; you're making it about you and not the genuinely non harmful way it's meant.  
---
With that being said, anyone who is openly homophobic or racist or whatever, then yes they should get punished. As for the elitist thing, it's just how it is. Elitists will always be present in any game. You have the fortunate ability to tune them out though. Ignore them and move on. Clearly they're not your cup of tea and you will for sure be able to find like minded players to game with.  
---
Here's to hoping you're able to stay positive through your adventure in Azeroth!
---
Everything is viable, just not optimal
---
Or just make flying slow enough as to not be convenient, your mount tires if you fly too high (so you still see people, don't just fly over everything, obviously have zone exceptions so you can have flying centric set pieces like stormpeaks), if you are flying low then make it easy to dismount people do it's not an escape in wpvp.
---
Platinumwow is becoming my new favorite should check him out. Great editing.
---
wow this is so cool, love the coloring of the continents, great job!!
---
&gt;Rogues just aren't as cool
---
Subjective, personally i think the sliding on ice looks silly AF, and i even played a rogue in vanilla.
---
But regardless of opinion, did it ever occur to people that this animation is because Classic runs on the Legion engine?
---
I know #nochanges should prevail but no matter how much you want it you just can't have 100% #nochanges, you just can't.
---
15 when I started. 
---
One thing people forget is that in the start, there were almost no spell damage gear and only came from raids. Lots of the blue in 5man got added later.
---
Goblin has sapper charges, XL jumper cables, mortar, etc. The best (but expensive) way to do it is to level Gnomish, craft yourself all the BoP Gnomish stuff, then unlearn, and come back as Goblin to be able to craft those BoPs and keep it to be able to craft your own consumables (like sapper charges).
---
Lol what, not a 1v1 spec?
---
Ele shams are pretty damn good at 1v1 as well.
---
There were people unironically calling people cucks and yelling MAGA on beta the other night in world chat. I'm not saying Trump supporters are bad, but these were the 4chan brand we're all familiar with. I've also seen EU players saying super racist shit about refugees and calling Americans spergs.
---
That's gonna be there also elitism, racism, sexism, and all kinds of shit.
---
It was there before, and we played around it. It likely won't be as bad this time due to higher ages. It's not so bad on the beta, and report doesn't even work in beta so...
---
Well, I do believe it's still better than most classes to be honest, you prehot yourself go in with the bear and you can heal yourself in case of emergency.
---
For some reason all the classic fans are trying to convince blizzard to leave live to casuals on here, despite their not even wanting to play it, so anti retail spite might cheat us out of that best of both worlds opportunity.
---
Does anyone have BiS lists for pvp specs? Specifically warrior? I can find plenty for pve specs but often pvp specs seem left out. I know sometimes BiS is an opinion when it comes to pvp, but seeing a few lists would be helpful
---
It's gonna start out slow embrace it. You'll love it believe me.
---
Hmmmm is it a deep talent in demo? Demo was definitely NOT a good dps choice in vanilla from what I recall....so having less threat in that skill tree seems useless.
---
Cut the shit.
---
Social behavior doesn't change unless people are upset and express it. Life is 100% what you do about it.
---
ofc
---
Yes that will run it without any issues.
---
Has there been any word about the unarmored 60 racial mounts?
---
I was looking forward to buying them (missed them by a few weeks in Vanilla) but it seems like the armored versions are the default ones.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman
---
Yes. Substantially.
---
**No true Scotsman**
---
No true Scotsman or appeal to purity is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule ("no true Scotsman would do such a thing"; i.e., those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group).
---
I was 24. Played with people that were 18-30 at the time. I only sucked at learning encounters and learned to embrace healing because it boiled down to whack a mole. I tanked once pallies were available for horde through Cata. While I may have more wisdom when it comes to video games I have a lot less time. It's also no coincidence that once I stopped playing wow I started taking on more responsibility at work and got married...haha.
---
I believe it comes from the game engine upgrade. Classic will run on Legion engine which had the new updated animations.
---
It depends on your plans/goals in the long run. I plan on doing progression raiding so I'll be spamming dungeons trying to get some of the strongest pre raid gear possible, farming for consumables, and getting my alchemy up for the guild. 
---
I started my account in Dec of 2004, never took a break longer than a normal vacation and still felt like I always had something to do, sometimes it was just standing outside IF dueling but there is a lot imo.
---
Please sell me this
---
funny because if you do you will see that the overall wow search goes up with the searches of classic wow.
---
So people searching for classic wow are also searching with "wow" which isnt a suprise and also makes the comparison way worse.
---
Well from the beginning there won't be any twinks to be honest. And this is not retail, big % of people won't even raid. They'll pvp, mess around. When you got your prebis you're good to stomp people.
---
shaman probably has the highest skill ceiling of any class in my opinion. there's a lot of room for outplay against classes that ''counter'' you by knowing when to alternate between playing aggro and defensive, and finding the small windows of opportunity to actually cast lightning bolt/chain lightning.
---
iirc they said they weren't going to have unarmored mounts in Classic. (if I'm wrong please correct me)
---
I don't normally feel bad for people but your an exception...
---
But depending on how people react it could go towards or away from what you idealize. 
---
Odd but an example some people work harder on a goal to spite people who said they can’t do it while others will fall apart. 
---
How you react and behave as a result of what happens will also make them think or go towards you or away from you.
---
I don’t recall this change. But I’m happy it will be reverted!
---
The game has changed, and so have we, I think that may have a bit of an impact on class distribution. Guilds that are recruiting now that don’t have most of the core positions set in stone with people they know will likely never kill a single raid boss together. The main tank and raid leader are the two most important positions in a raid, you can’t plan to farm that out to some random this far in advance.
---
Oh you got a new graphics card
---
Since things are being released in their 1.12 version, it’s understandable imo that the mounts also are
---
I wonder if they made both versions available all the time, how many would opt for the unarmored version instead of the armored version, since both would have the same status in classic
---
How can you not like mccuck
---
And you build a personal community with a guild friends and people you do stuff with. Certain things like barrens chat you just work to ignore.
---
They probably meant the guild maga
---
It was a good game by old standards in the same way gunpowder canon was a good siege weapon on Castles. 
---
But by all means, try it at least. Some people like watching Sports while others LARP around.
---
Smoooth
---
You're free to do whatever you want but just because you're following the rules of the game doesn't not make you a coward.
---
Make Azeroth Great Again?
---
They actually added an item in retail called Inky Potions that turn the game into old school night time mode. You can purchase them at the dark moon faire for a really reasonable price. Pretty cool - but I would prefer it to just be an option.
---
Very true. The is great great for every type of player.
---
Sell tanking services where as payment you get all the grey drops. It adds up and you still get your loot.
---
Notice how mine was used in a situation that makes sense and yours was used here...?
---
No? You dont? Thats the problem....
---
He's probably horde....
---
Im glad im going paladin because it looks like im getting geared faster than warriors and mages and what not.
---
It's so cringe. I can't stop reading it tho
---
25 when I started. Played holy pally on Stormrage, Generations guild. Raided MC, BWL, AQ40. Best time of my life :)
---
I posted damn near the same picture... And it was removed for "low effort". Wtf
---
My favorite is when you get a string of miss/dodge/parry and end up blowing a cooldown to take down a regular pull because rng hates you.
---
Hm there's a lot of new players so the class distribution seem off. But from private servers usually in Vanilla it's 1. Warrior 2. Mage 3. Hunters followed very closely by Rogues.
---
You're smooth
---
This is the *only* WoW worth playing for someone new. :)
---
And you can't do that on retail? You can do all of that and MORE of it on retail.
---
It's math.  If you get 1 damage every couple of levels, when your abilities do 13-17 damage that's significant.  When your abilities do 255-337 damage, it's a lot less.
---
It's also my experience from back when that was live, and my experience from private servers.
---
You advertise your service in trade chat or somebody asks for an an enchanter and you get a small fee for your work
---
Honestly while I started alliance due to rl friends I’ll probably just flip a coin.
---
They effectively have. Right now in BFA there is no flying on the new continents. They just add it back in the last patch of every expansion.
---
Awesome!
---
And your point is?
---
New animation is not vanilla. Just like the character models.
---
Thanks. Most of it "fades" out of combat as well to give a de-cluttered experience. 
---
I did at one stage have the minimap bottom centre but I found it was too distracting in combat and the whole reason I started this UI was to minimise combat distractions (when raid tanking Legion raids) to what I needed to focus on.
---
Once (/if) I get Gnosis (the Daddy of all castbar addons) working for Classic Beta I'll have the cast bars (mine and target) immediately above the healthbars too (growing left and right as appropriate)
---
It's the new gryphon paths. They used to actually hit the FP before moving along, now they sorta bob towards IF on it's way to SW
---
They will obviously cap servers and don't allow more than 5K people per realm.
---
May be more likely to get an invite but my account was made in 2010 after my OG was banned for selling gold and I received an invite. So there's definitely hope albeit extremely slim.
---
Lol 50 bucks, we got like 25 and can do once in 14 days, seems like we're really europoors afterall :D
---
Yes it is
---
I remember first time i played wow you came in to this big world and knew nothing about anything, then you have the travel time there took a little bit of time but thats how its was in the real world to.
---
After this there are the community you had to make friends be nice to ppl because there was No LFG so you had to find a group by You self.
---
I liked the part where he cast frostbolt
---
It really does, however the change might be from simply Classic running on a newer game engine (Legion) where the animations were updated.
---
(But even suggesting this gets downvotes in this thread lol)
---
Mind control does not allow you to use that players abilities. Only move them and make them auto attack.
---
wowhobbs' cousin
---
What’s the time stamp for it ?
---
nice now he's applying the "point out the other user's funny username" meme
---
? People got an invite without a subscription but nice going back on a 11 day old comment
---
Same login yes
---
Inmigrats!
---
Where did they state that ?
---
WoW became super popular in the first place because it is so easy to understand. Quests give you detailed instructions on were to go, you dont lose experience points when you die, towns are clearly laid out ect.
---
You will love it. Just dont be afraid to ask question or good topics and you will have a blast. Enjoy!
---
Swords or daggers: duo leveling a rogue with a warrior. Which build and weapon will be faster and more efficient? Swords or backstab daggers?
---
Thanks.
---
You have a good point. Sorry if I came off rude.
---
Gear drop rates in classic are pretty terrible, it is not uncommon to clear 3 instances with out a single caster gear drop.
---
These are just another man's opinion...   
---
/chad
---
Hunter or Warlock. They are both excellent wPvP classes. I'd say hunter is slightly better, but that depends entirely on your playstyle.
---
I'd strongly advice against going warrior if you want to wPvP, that is unless you know for sure that you will have friends with you. A solo warrior in PvP is a painful experience. The upside is easy dungeon groups if you are comfortable tanking.
---
Typically the meta is to have engineering as mandatory profession and some gold making profession for second, if you don't need gold making profession because have an alternative, then you pick something for guild.
---
Hi, /u/justsomespecial
---
Like 5 mins in or whenever he starts talking. He's just really excited setting up the stream and getting in.
---
Just keep checking the launcher every 30 minutes like I do! It's totally okay and not detrimental to your mental stability!
---
Thank you so much !
---
Tauren hunter. Just like when i first started.
---
Gnome escape artist is the best racial. Losing humans sword skill etc isn’t even a big deal, it will affect your dps in a unnoticed way. But escape artist on a class that are dependent on being able to move is HUGE.
---
I had feeling that everyone who opted for beta got stress test invitation.
---
Not in 1.12
---
It's perfekt

Get yourself that sweet unlimited data. I think I hit 30-100GBs a month just leaving streaming stuff running sometimes lol.

Drop out of school. Simple.

Cata and the Raid Finder were my \#Walkaway

Tbh looking at how few actually got access, much greater :D
---
OP put away your vagina bro you autistic sperg
---
More like miss-tress
---
Currently conflicted. Always played Horde and feel like I’ve only ever experienced 50% of the game.
---
Oh mate none will tell you that you can't tank as Nelf warrior. None will tell you, hey we don't need human priest.. People will be more pleased with dorf priest, but that's it. Just play what you feel like, it's not big of a deal
---
What server did u play on?
---
Was in Shadow of Death! Can't wait for classic.
---
You should go full enhancement and respec to resto around lvl 54. Most healing classes do this because you don’t need the healing talents to heal early dungeons so enhancement helps you level faster. Once you respec you will be spending lvl 54-60 in dungeons non stop. You’ll have prebis gear you are needing to grind for in these endgame dungeons so leveling 54-60 only grinding dungeons and dungeons quests isn’t that bad. 
---
As far as professions go it’s totally up to you. Keep in mind professions like tailoring, blacksmithing and leatherworking often allow you to craft misproportionate gear for your profession level. For instance with tailoring, once you finish linen and get to wool you’re able to craft green items around the lvl 12-19 use range. Wool drops in areas lvl 20+ and it takes so long to get enough linen to finish that part of tailoring you’ll be over level 20. So unless you invest a bunch of money buying skins for your leather working you’ll almost never be crafting useful gear for yourself until lvl 60
---
23:00 GMT 26th August
---
Thinking back to vanilla - I would still think combat swords.  The reason being that you would probably quickly pull threat with backstab.  Also, I think combat had blade flurry which would be useful for taking on multiple mobs once you get it.
---
Looks to me like I clicked the 4 abilities that have 30s-3m cooldowns, while everything else was hot keyed.
---
Is that really all?
---
If you intend to main a priest, shaman healer you will likely NEED a farming alt to maintain a steady flow of money.
---
Druid healers can do stealth Princess runs to farm LArge Brilliant Shards. 
---
If you main a prot warrior, you will basically be forced to mine ore or have a farming alt. They cannot farm effective due to Thier crazy lack of healing and insane gear repair bills
---
&gt; Most of it "fades" out of combat as well to give a de-cluttered experience. 
---
Whelp, I'm sold. Most of my previous UIs were completely invisible, unless you selected a target or were in combat. Really makes the beauty on an ultrawide monitor shine.
---
&gt; I did at one stage have the minimap bottom centre but I found it was too distracting in combat
---
Yeah, it's only useful for leveling, since half the time you're looking at the minimap. Looking top right that often is a pita. I might dig in and try a show bind toggle come launch.
---
If you get Gnosis working, I'm pretty sure you'll be a god among Addon devs. That was pretty much the de-facto addon for our raiding 'locks. Someone else got Necrosis up and working, so things are looking good on the UI front.
---
No matter what you do, how much you play, or how lucky you are, you will never, ever have full BiS gear ever again.
---
The funny part? Netherwind was trash for the most part aside from let's and I believe gloves.
---
Raids aren't hard, they were being cleared on the first night on pservers by people who knew what they were doing.
---
No, get rekt noob
---
Have a look for yourself.....

On the left is oldschool WoW night btw.
---
&gt;but this time around was thinking human rogue for end game raids.
---
Same but older me this time is just gonna have fun on a gnome rogue instead. And if a guild don't accept me cuz i picked gnome then i just know it isn't a guild for me anyways.
---
Its not really worth the mana until TBC Seal of Blood.
---
After they made the npc's immune, I just mind controlled the player and had them fight the npc. There was a tiny spot to rez just out of aggro range by the battlemasters in Ironforge. Plenty of alliance got a surprise when every battlemaster laid the smack down all at once.
---
Do we know if the repeatable cloth rep turns in will be available phase one yet? 
---
Wanting to grind Wintersping Frostsaber as drawf. 
---
This  will determine if I hike to NE starting area to level or not. Thanks!
---
This post is retarded
---
Are you a class with a res? Gnome, if not goblin
---
While you wait, dig in dem gold reserves and melt them down in to some bags, for the newbies. A nice welcome is always nice. Made over 300 bags in the past 4 days and handed them out.
---
Do your part
---
Wow how did I not notice lol. Way better dark!
---
That’s neat but I agree it’d be best an option.
---
I'm struggling to level my 11 warrior a bit.   I feel like even fighting one mob always runs me near death.    If two pull I have to run, I'll never make it.  I have a two handed green axe with decent stats on it and some points in improved rend.  I have decent chain mail armor.   I use heroic strike whenever possible and keep battle shout up at all times. 
---
 Any advice?   It's been so long, I don't know if i just remember things differently or if I'm doing something wrong.
---
Ah yes, rage using retaliation to kill 1 mob because of stupid rng
---
As he puts it, the vanilla brain!
---
Yeah it's almost all the way down sadly. No most warlocks go the classic SM/Ruin spec in raids. Possible to do some sort of hybrid build if managing threat is your biggest concern.
---
People like that are the cancer that killed WoW. Luckily they have their disease-ridden BFA now, and can stay out of Classic.
---
When did you get your invite? Did they send out more?
---
This reasoning exactly ! I miss old guides. These days everyone makes a YT vid guide and spends 10 min talking about crap and 5 min the actual guide. Wish there would be no quest helper addons in game it ruins the fun of having to go to a site like thottbot and look for the specific thing you need also reading all the coments and screenshots people would post.
---
they are absolutely strong against certain classes, but they are very straight forward with few tricks up their sleeve unless the enemy is a caster who needs to hard cast due to earth shock and grounding totem. mages are a good example.   you are very vulnerable to outplays, while you can only outplay a couple casters and the occasional unprepared hunter.  
---
  but you have matchups that are incredible bad for you, like rogues and warlocks on equal skill level.  in my experience they could fall into the rock paper scissor  category in 1v1, while other classes that i considder 1v1 specs are more versatile against more classes, like rogues, hunters, shadowpriests and warlocks.  
---
it is just too hard to recover from a well timed interrupt, because you cannot beat good players with shock spells and lightning shield alone.
---
The skill isn't expensive in classic. Each faction has its own mount skill, so there's kodo riding, horse riding etc. that you can only learn after doing a rep grind and it costs only about 100g or thereabouts.
---
No, that is the nature of all software development. It is impossible to create bug-free software for anything beyond the most trivial software. If you tried to uphold that standard, you would never ship anything. Every software company in the world ships with bugs that they have determined to be a low priority.
---
Warlock seconded. If you do warrior you will have to respect every raid, or pvp day.
---
Affliction locks are great in pvp, and still bring things to raid in form of summons, banish, and cookies, and soul stone
---
Hate to be that guy but the Riding Turtle was actually available in Vanilla. The NPC's name was originally "Landro" and the Riding Turtle was redeemable.

Subtraction is a thing
---
bfa is an expansion. People search for game name most of the time, not by expansion name
---
Wanted to go Hunter. I figured I'd start with mining and skinning, with the intent to drop skinning for engineering later at 60. 
---
Thing is, instead of hoarding a bunch of mats forever, why not do leather working? Now I'm not suggesting to go deep into it, but just use it to make greens from the skins to make more money. This should give me more than enough money to buy a mount at 40, and perhaps even buy some engineering mats. Is it plausible?
---
Almost every talent tree has somewhere it shines. It doesn't have to be in end-game raids and topping meters.
---
That doesn't sound terrible. I love grinding for gears lol
---
this only ever happened to me on private servers, never in real vanilla.
---
Well honestly you can abuse clear max zones to get most high end nodes... But rushing is not a good idea, you might burn out after that hard grind.. Later on its good to sell fadeleaf, free action potions, swiftness potions, because they're usable on max level. On launch, no one got cash to spend, so everything is super cheap.
---
Thier official stance on things like boomies and enh shamans. "You think you want this.. but you don't"
---
Warriors take the most work of any class so just be ready for that.
---
It's the worst solo class tied with Priest probably.
---
That said, it sounds like you have strategies to overcome that (gold from hosting runs, priest partner, dedicated). So I would say roll warrior. A warrior ahead of the curve is the most fun class imo.
---
Well to be fair everyone should lose to warlocks given equal skill level and gear, so saying that warlocks can beat you is kind of hollow.
---
I would buy this.
---
Except this is all based on Warcraft 3. Many of the buildings in WoW are straight up copies of those from WC3.
---
Ele/Resto is standard premade PvP spec for Shaman. You're still primarily a healer/support, just that you can global people.
---
If you intend to no-life do it. They are the best dps when geared, and 1 of every group pretty much needs to be a warrior
---
Was warlocks good in pvp? Im probably going to play warlock because my guild is in need of warlocks but i would also like to pvp on the side and do open world pvp. Are locks good in this regard? I have heard very mix things about warlocks in pvp.
---
This isn't dark enough imo I want something more like this....

How does someone enchant your items in vanilla, trade the item or in the trade window? Can someone enchant a BoE item after its been equipped?
---
You forgot releasing new expansions such as TBC while also keeping Vanilla servers alive.
---
Enjoy your "watching streamers" Classic summer, all!
---
Warrior and feral druids have more abilities to keep track of then probably anything due to stance dancing
---
&gt;your role in pvp is being a burst turret that can annihilate targets with a lightning bolt-chain lightning-shock combo
---
That's one of the things you do as an ele/resto shaman, but your role/job is just as much to support and heal people as it is to burst people.
---
It's a very high skill cap class because it takes a lot of experience to know when you're supposed to burst someone vs. keeping your team alive.
---
What is the best source of information that will pertain to WoW classic? Things like skill, weapons and armor, and crafting? Things a person who never played WoW might need to know.
---
Nah the gnome warlock Rambozo. Hes in some of the screenshots
---
It’s not really a fair poll. I want classic+ but with optional character transfer to the new server. Classic itself should be kept as a timepiece
---
PFFFF 
---
Warriors get dunked on in pvp all the way until they get their epic mount, and even then, you'll still need the gear to stand any chance against any class that's not a rogue. 
---
You'll die easily to priests due to no rage generation from bubble
---
You'll get your ass kitted by hunters, druids, mages, warlocks, and even shamans. I know, because I was an enh shaman in the ely pserver and I'd frost shock run around r14 warriors till they died. 
---
Again, if you need a healer to be good, you ain't good son. Reroll something actually useful. I've never actually seen a warrior in pvp that didnt get rekt besides premades, but that's a different story
---
man i have been trying to find this video for awhile, the good ol days

Nobody said anything about seeking the infinitely perfect program. This message just acknowledges that the standards have significantly changed since the culture of "We'll just fix it after release so we can shoehorn it into a more fiscally beneficial release date" rose into being.
---
That's not inherent to videogame development. It's inherent to current established company trends. It really is possible to work on a game longer to get a more complete product on release.
---
No shit sperg is was made 15 years ago on a potato computer
---
it doesn't effect gameplay but does effect immersion.  Hardly game breaking but it is something I hope they fix.
---
Wish in one hand, shit in the other. See which one fills up first.
---
What are those 4 islands supposed to be at the top, near eastern kingdoms?
---
I'd say daggers. That warrior is gonna want the swords
---
Thats good to know! I personally never intended to play the beta even if it came out for that reason, it can kind of ruin the magic and excitement of the first few days of game play.
---
SM/Ruin build was a beast in PVP. Topped with fear being ridiculous outside of PvP trinkets, they were pretty good. On the beta at 30, they are undoubtably #1.
---
I did and git to 20 in 16 hours as hunter :(
---
The mods clamp down on calling people homosexuals on here. You can get either banned, or shadowbanned, where all your comments go into automatic spam filter. This sub is basically a bubble. The actual players are a lot more homophobic then it looks
---
I would but your comment was deleted from that thread apparently, so kinda hard to judge.
---
These guilds do tons of runs on private private realms beforehand, since they have the core that the main realm runs on. So while it is 50mins, it's more like something that's been heavily run through by them in prep. Which won't happen for live, but it'll still be cleared quick
---
Graphics sure have come a long way....
---
Skinning devilsaurs was such good money, there was a litterally mafia dedicated to killing em
---
u do know u can play pservers to feed ur cravins right?
---
I agree my 'joke' wasn't funny but don't call out people for using 'overused' memes and thinkin they're hilarious with a name like that.
---
It caries a little. For release it doesn't matter much because you should choose a race you want to play, but for the competition everyone will be asked to use the same.
---
Meh, I got ganked/camped plenty back in vanilla on a warrior = no escape. You just roll with it and how it screws up your leveling. It's not a big deal in the long run, and you know that when you turn 60 and are bored, you can do a bit of the same. It was worth it getting ganked like mad in exchange for getting to do the same sometimes
---
1) turn it into prints
---
2) sell it on here
---
3) profit
---
For sure.
---
It's been reported in the bug megathread at least twice.
---
So... The main solution of having more servers to not having to deal with layering is the exit strategy to failed layering... Wow
---
The scary part is, this isn't an if, it's a how many servers don't dwindle in population.
---
I think this is cool either way. I remember when I was really into Diablo 2 and my aunt got me one of those big guide books from the game store. I would read it whenever I didn't have access to a computer to actually play it
---
Do you think blizzard would do this? People would deamand each expansions own server. Also it would split the community even more, guilds and friends would go apartsomeone likes vanilla, the other tbc the third wotlk and so on. I dont think its a viable option
---
Thanks for the response! Well put and something to certainly consider.
---
Remember the original crowd was largely forced off the game. Consider the forceful integration of blood elves into the horde. Most horde players hated the association of the blood elves. But they add to millions of players so blizzard has to think about the $$$ at some level
---
Read my answer to the other guy.
---
And yet, nihilum, the best pve guild at the time took 3 months to clear naxx fully after it was released.
---
If blizzard tunes the raids to the same degree as they were tuned back in wow classic you wont get guilds clearing content the first night of release. It wont take as long I bet, but it wont be a case of naxx releases and that same day you get the world first naxx clear.
---
As far as leveling is concerned, Kargoz has a pretty good guide on YouTube.
---
The official website or a archived version of the official website from 2005
---
Or you know, do it the way old school Runescape does it and release NEW content
---
I’m planning to play an undead warlock and it seems like the consensus is that engineering/tailoring are the best professions at 60. But what about for leveling? Do most people take two gathering professions and switch to crafting later?
---
wanted to go druid too but in wpvp, or any pvp related as a dmg spec, ur mainly in caster form.. spaming 1 skill lol
---
I have to say this really helped reading all the comments above I really think  I'll go with what I enjoyed  the most.
---
 young me only picked Night Elf because I thought  shadow meld was only stealth in the game.
---
after I got to 60 and got gear I regretted it and wanted human because grass looked greener you know. but I really learned to use the racial  to my advantage and had alot of fun with it, and fell in love with what became my play style that worked really well for me in pvp. 
---
thanks reddit
---
That's a bummer. :( but thanks for answering.
---
The Ancient Frostsaber will elude me forever then!
---
Really cool !
---
I can understand the aesthetic purpose of recreating the exact function and style of the FP's, but is there a functional difference? Are the flights longer/shorter?
---
just claim that you stream lol
---
True story. I'm still friends with over a dozen friends met through the WoW classic experience. Met many of them IRL and still game with all of them in some fashion.
---
Nah. Will probably be Orgrimar.
---
The Broken Isles from WC2 and WC3.
---
Before the great Retcon of WoW:Legion, they were actual islands.
---
Depends on your timescale for levelling. Find someone who is levelling leatherworking and you’ll be able to get them to make you items for free (as they are getting a skill up for free). Buying a mount at 40 is tough and there won’t be much gold made from the AH early on (first 1-2 weeks)
---
Same here :( 
---
I was going to join a private server, but don’t want to kill the hype. I’m waiting until 8/27.
---
So do you mean "Releasing minor/major updates "?
---
Open trade window, insert item into the "will not be traded" box, then enchant the item. Equipped BoEs can be enchanted.
---
WANT
---
"Worth maintaining" is sort of subjective. Are you planning on speed leveling? If so the. No, you would only keep up First Aid.
---
I would argue that Classic is the best possible time to start playing. The modern game has a really poor new player experience.

True story. At least I've had 1 stress test day and I get another day this week. I've been watching hours and hours of twitch.

There's a few websites that were primarily used for undocumented servers that are transitioning to classic.
---
My personal recommendation is [http://classicdb.com](http://classicdb.com) but [https://classic.wowhead.com/](https://classic.wowhead.com/) works as well (note the classic in front of the domain is what makes wowhead convert to classic mode)
---
Except everything feels much less immersive, much less rewarding, has much less heart. And this is coming from someone who has played since vanilla released and I still play BFA, the games are just completely different.       
---
Vanilla wow is much more immersive whereas retail is very much an action RPG collectathon
---
If you can manage to mentally distance yourself from the speed levelers and the hardcore raiders, there is no issue at all there. In fact, as a filthy casual you'll get to enjoy the game for much longer than the hardcores. The hardcores will run out of content sooner rather than later, which is when you'll be lvl40 RPing in Feralas or some shit. The game is much better if do not let others dictate your speed.
---
I suggest a PvE server, though. Being lvl30 when the first guys hit 60 and decide to go for a ganking trip in STV is awful (unless your faction decides on retribution, in which case it's hilarious fun...)

Yeah, keep telling yourself that dude. It's a dry run to test bugs. Desperate players like you are trying to turn it into something it's not. I don't mean to sound rude but what you wrote is pretty damn ridiculous
---
Why would we need extensive testing for even levels? And yeah, why not go 39, then 49 for testing mounts? Those levels will all get tested eventually, and they will slowly gate the levels as they have. They could have just killed 2 birds with 1 stone kind of thing. Blizz made brackets for a a reason too, should we just test all the talent trees and mounts and then release the game and see if PvP works OK too? get some sleep ;P
---
WoD leveling was incredible IMO. Even the little treasures were a million times better than the ones we got in either Legion or BFA.
---
I never did 2 gathering professions , because having a gathering and crafting is so nice. I generally do herb/alch, love having those pots while I level, they really help.

Flying kills wPVP, please no flying.

Classicdb.ch or wowhead's classic database. Take everything with a grain of salt though because some values might be off, but most should be accurate.
---
The vast majority of people do not want this.
---
What faction are you going to be? Warlocks are more powerful on the Horde because you don't have to contend with undead and their racial will of the forsaken.
---
Do not feed.
---
I cannot speak to Warrior specifics but you may wish to consider your level relative to the mobs you are against. Balancing your levelling between zones ensures you keep quests green/yellow for optimal levelling speed
---
Skinning and being careful with money (I.e not buying random gear that you don’t need and other stuff on the AH) should net you enough for your 40 mount. Once at 40 with your mount you can run around mining a lot easier and can probably drop skinning at the point for engi - as a hunter you can farm princess for gold so you don’t need money making profs at 60. Hope this helps
---
yo this would be so insane, imagine in the day everything is cool and all, but at night it goes so dark you need a lantern attached to your belt to have a light radius around you just like in Diablo 2. PvP would be insane too, people crossing path on the dark roads. awww man the dream.
---
McScreamy is too much for my ears too. He was losin' it last night after they got worked in WSG.
---
&gt; What faction are you going to be?
---
Im going to be playing horde. So that makes it better because you dont play vs undeads? Interesting, didnt think about that.
---
Yeah absolutely. Just make sure to craft things people would actually buy.
---
A straight do-over
---
I checked out right before tbc because nothing sounded like they had a clue what direction they really ought to have gone in.
---
Then roll on a PvE server. Honestly it sucked so much ass sometimes in vanilla getting camped - so much typing to guildies and LocalDefense for help. But I'd rather be ganked and camped by high levels while leveling than roll a PvE server. And this is speaking as someone who is now busy in medical school and "does not have time" to get camped. I'll just go study or watch some YouTube videos til they leave. Not even worth it to wait for guildies at this point.
---
I know this will get buried, and it is such an obscure thing that I doubt anyone has the answer, but has any beta tester killed a Rotted One (L25ish mob in Raven Hill Cemetery) yet to confirm that the worms they spawn drop the coveted Grave Moss herb?

Allakhazam's archived history alludes to them dropping nothing, yet every private server I have played upon has the worms dropping it at a 14%ish rate.   
---
I imagine that the private servers are wrong, but clarification would be nice.
---
Even the 1.12 could handle widescreen perfectly.
---
First don’t just stand in combat with a mob. Most attack faster than you do you will take more damage than you need to be letting it hit you while waiting to swing again. 
---
Put hamstring on the mob and kite it, only going in to melee when you can auto attack again. In some cases this will half the damage you take. Get a big slow two-handed weapon to maximize this effect. 
---
The other secret is that spirit is actually amazing as a leveling stat. Strength and agility don’t add all that much damage and you won’t be fighting long enough for it to add up. Unless you are a few damage short of killing a mob in a certain number of attacks, more strength does absolutely nothing for you. With a high amount of spirit and the strategy above you’ll passively regent enough health going from mob to mob that you rarely need to eat or bandage.
---
Yeah of course. There will be a bunch of us over 25 who will want to raid, but get it done quickly and with some backups.
---
My goal is to find a guild that always has 4-5 extra people so when people cant make a night it isn't a huge deal
---
Wc quest bfd quest sm quest rfd quest marudon quest all give very good weapons
---
Confirmed no unarmored mounts.
---
Also in for a print
---
At first I was down for the streamer priority, but now it’s just cruel.
---
They want to a show us a bunch of random Twitch celebrities playing our favorite game. But we’re only allowed to watch.
---
I get you OP. We just want to play.
---
Fine, it will grow the vanilla community – it’s an investment for 3 months from now.
---
We had a casual raiding guild. Granted you wouldnt get into progression raid all the time, but you would do dungeons with the crew and be called upon as reinforcement or in alt raids
---
I think people are over estimating how easy it will be to hop layers. Sure it's pretty easy in the first phase of Beta, but it's Beta, there are obviously kinks to work out. They said that Guilds will be forced to the same layer. You would essentially find a random someone that is on a different layer than you and have them invite you to group. And the only way to know if they are on a different layer would be to go to a specific location and try to see each other. It's not like you can do 
---
/layer and it gives you your layers ID. 
---
At the end of the day, it will probably be more hassle than it's worth, especially if they fix the Same Guild/Same Layer situation.
---
stopped paying attention after personal loot.
---
stopped reading at "betterment".
---
Think you are talking about world of roguecraft?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drrvQliCvB8
---
iirc it's just not in the beta, but that they have not finalized the decision. They could have said it somewhere and I missed it.
---
WoW classic is worth playing for anyone that enjoys games. Its an experience on its own, the ability to be placed into a living world that is free for you to explore is something else, interacting with other people and making friends along the way.
---
You've yet to realize that a majority of classic players will be retail players.
---
Unfortunately for this case, because everything balance-wise will be 1.12, and it was during Vanilla that they made most mobs immune to MC, most NPC's like this won't be MC'able.
---
I would honestly play with 1.0 -&gt; 1.12 progressive balance, but I'm also a maniac in that regard, and I understand why normalizing everything to 1.12 is overall a way better solution.
---
Inky Potion is actually way darker
---
In my experience in vanilla it was always better to sell the raw mats unless you are able to get some of the more renowned patterns. As a hunter you are able to farm better than most, second only to a decent mage.
---
I would love to see additional raids in classic itself and probably arenas in classic as well. Similar to what we got with TBC but staying on Azeroth.
---
Post removed as a Rule #7 low-effort/troll post.
---
Do we know if they going to change it? Beta nights seem pretty bright at the moment
---
This is Warrior. People call it the hardest class to level for a reason. Once you get to 30ish and start collecting some nice dungeon gear things will start to take off. Keep in mind you will never AoE grind like a Mage or chain pull like a Hunter.
---
Tip: get first aid. It's amazing.
---
I think it was in one of the Irvine videos where a dev said that they'll be going with the system that existed before 1.12 because it existed throughout most of vanilla and it's what players remember.
---
May not make the most sense but that's what they're doing.
---
Das one hungry trollboi.
---
Warlocks are better on alliance side because you don’t have to deal with all of the paladins and priests constantly dispelling every single magic DoT you cast!  The WoTF sigma is also so (inappropriately) bad, that as an alliance warlock you’ll have less people to contend with your loot.  Escape artist and 5% int on a gnome is pretty worth while as well.
---
I would totally join it!
---
I wasn't sure if you were being sarcastic or not until I heard him start talking. He was legit super excited, and I've never heard that kind of emotion out of him before (or any emotion, for that matter)
---
Yeah im expecting guilds upon guilds farming them
---
if alliance has iron forge, where is the horde place if not orgi?
---
Private servers had dynamic respawns on nodes, and it went in favor of being more abundant. The more people in an area, the faster the respawns.
---
till you learn that WoW was *the* ez-modo MMO at launch...
---
I intend for a rogue to be my main. Any strats with it?
---
Should have been kept to blades edge mountains and netherstorm, those two zones really suit flying, and keeping it a bonus mechanic that you only sometimes use would have solved most issues. Just add a fp/taxi to the other areas like Skettis etc
---
Same with icecrown in wotlk, zone wouldn't be the same without flying and it works very well there.
---
Having to walk everywhere and people buffing each other as you pass them feels like you’re constantly high giving your faction as you cross paths. Feels nice.
---
played by spergs like me on private servers.
---
Completely agree, SM/ruin means you don’t have to respec for PvP and PvE plus a free mount at 40. Pretty badass
---
I bought a 2013 MSI laptop on a public selling website in my area. Bought it for 400$ and it's an i7 with a GTX 765M - pretty overkill but what I'm trying to say is that you can get a dope pc for classic and it'll play so smoothly you'll think there's butter in the rig. I played the stress test with the crazy amount of people and it was smoooooooooth.
---
Do you get a kick out of spreading misinformation? That screenshot of Mulgore is either using the [Inky Black Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=124640/inky-black-potion) or it's been photoshopped using Night Effect.
---
This is Lakeshire at night on BfA: [https://i.imgur.com/hKABc6a.png](https://i.imgur.com/hKABc6a.png)
---
No kidding, the atmosphere would be insane. Like it would actually gets dark at a night instead of just dim, things like this doesnt seem like much but it makes the game so much more immersive.
---
Only have 1 friend playing classic everyone else doesnt want the re addiction
---
Looks like the left side has some animal with its eyes closed, and the right side at the top is a baby elephant! So cute!!
---
Yes equipped items can be enchanted. You either give the enchanted your own materials that you’ve purchased or acquired and typically some fee or tip on top of that or you just pay a set price and the enchanter will furnish everything.
---
I cannot confirm, but I would expect not. In all cases I recall - small mobs that spawn from a large mob do not have a loot table.
---
Nah xping two producing professions like engineering and clothing from scratch will be an impossible gold/time sink.
---
2 producing professions is an hardcore crafter player. It really changes your goals. Engineering is indeed a gamebreaker in wpvp and bg's in Vanilla I'd always recommend it, but take mining to fund it. Use what is useful for eng leveling and sell the leftovers, mine everything.
---
If you aren't the main clothing in your guild, It's a useless craft at 300 since you wont get the fantastic recipes. Will give you an edge for leveling though as you can stuff yourself as a priest. At the time I played mostly a Skinning/Clothing priest and I was happy to fund my clothing with the skinning. Took Inscription at its release though to replace it, but was pretty hardcore so I could fund both.
---
Your choice, but if you stay on this be prepared to take a while on crafting.
---
Brah it releases at like 4pm Aug **26th** in America.
---
I've seen others talk about a 9-5 guild and other casual type guilds. I'm married with kids and a full time job, so I will be in that crowd as well. Hoping to play two hours a night after everyone else is in bed and a bit more on the weekends.
---
Don’t. Costs too much money and you’ll have to be choosy on your spell purchases too in order to buy your 40 mount. Sell your skins, keep your mining leveled if you can, but even good luck with that, and come back at 60 and do Engineering. Will make your life easier
---
No option for multiple?
---
They've already released 1.13
---
And it’s all been worthless since they were published
---
May I ask why you feel you have the right to be angry just because you didn’t get invited? 
---
It seems like you feel you were entitled to play, and that’s why you feel you have the right to be angry, which makes no sense.
---
It’s bit gimmicky but if you have hamstring and an attack swing timer you can attack and then kite, wait til you next swing and then attack again and then kite - this means you simply trade blow for blow, instead of taking 1.5 attacks per swing
---
Next post is going to be about white azeroth...ffs we get it, your gay...and you need the gaming community to know... who only cares about your in game character. Seriously it's not going to be an issue
---
Much appreciated
---
Anyone else realize that their sense of humor has changed a lot since back in vanilla?
---
I'm so pumped to play Paladin again. I rolled a Pally in the 2004 open beta and never looked back. Back then I wasn't very good, didn't know how to heal, what stat priorities were. I'm looking forward to maximizing my healing output in raids, and casually tanking/healing 5-mans.
---
youre right. you do have the responsibility to off heal when needed too, i should have mentioned that.  but i would disagree with  the high skill cap.  
---
   
---
while the decision making to heal or burst require awareness, the class itself is very straight forward.  hunters, rogues, warriors are classes i think of when it comes to high skill caps.  
---
  hunters need to manage traps, kiting, dead zone and autoshot weaving with more.  
---
 rogues have all their combos and cooldowns they need to manage.  
---
 warriors can be a headache with all the weapon switching and stance dancing that is required to play the class to the max.    
---
you could use that argument for any class really,  should i dps the enemy, or should i use my class utility to help my teammate?
---
... because nobody ever hides their vices from their spouse, amirite?
---
A lot of people replying to this thread seem to have many misconceptions about retail and classic.Is classic more casual friendly than retail? The answer is not black or white, it simply depends on your aim. The overall experience for casuals is better in classic imo and that's all thanks to the journey while leveling. The endgame however is a lot more casual friendly in retail than in vanilla.
---
As a casual in retail you'll see all the content, you might not do it at the most difficult lvl (although you could if you're good, it's more skill based than time investment based) or get the best gear (unless you're lucky ofcourse) but you'll see it without much effort. And that's ok if you're interested in other stuff besides high lvl raiding, cause there's plenty of it. Are you out for a few weeks/months? Not an issue everything basically resets every tier and there's a lot of catch up mechanics.
---
In classic you're probably not gonna see everything. When you manage to reach lvl 60, you're probably gonna take some time getting the adequate gear and some more getting the right consumables. If you manage to get through this you'll be able to see the first raid tiers for sure, not so sure about the last ones. The reason for that being that gearing is a very slow and constant effort. When you want to get the right gear for the next raid tier you have to have committed during the previous one or start commiting to it. There are no catch up mechanics, no way to get lucky, there's only effort and time investment.
---
Tl;dr:
---
I believe Classic has the better casual game experience because classic leveling wins against all the retail casual gaming measures they took. On the contrary though I believe the end game of classic is less casual friendly than Bfa. Not because of skill cause that requirement is higher in Mythic raids but rather in time investment.
---
you wont survive the age of internet with that attitude... go ahead waste your time telling people what to do..... good luck
---
Too bad you get reported afk if you're rogue-defending the flag
---
I forgot about the days of running around in random mail, leather, and mostly cloth items.
---
Hmm maybe you're right!
---
Can just stop nitpicking already?
---
I know this only a guide for leveling, but I enjoyed using it back in the day: [http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
Jokes aside I knew a guy who dropped out from playing too much. Definitely don’t want to be like him
---
I'm on the same page.
---
My only argument atm is that  Warrior will be worse in world pvp, but then again I do plan to go engi and gnome. Mage pulls me a lot because of how good they are in every single aspect, but then I did play a Warrior back in Vanilla and thought I was bad, I want to relive those days.
---
Grin and bear it bro. Warrior is hard. Bandage and eat is all you can do. Maybe you’ll get lucky and get your WW axe at 30-40. The payoff is at 60 when you’re the best tank class, top DPS class, and amazing in group PvP. Think of it as boot camp.
---
When should we expect the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza to begin?
---
Rolling Mage for the first time (mained Priest in vanilla) and conflicted on professions. 
---
Herb/alch v. Tailor/enchant? Why?
---
Try for something with at least and 8th gen i5, 256gb SSD, 8gb of memory, and GTX 1050. You can run it with less, but if you can afford it, it is definitely worth getting something with a separate graphics card.
---
Also, check Amazon for a lap desk. These are basically boards made to use a laptop and mouse on your lap.
---
Darkshore
---
You won't be welcome. It's only for the 30 year old no life try hards who missed out on being hardcore back in Vanilla. They get to satisfy their craving for completion 15 years later.
---
Every down vote = one hurt soul who knows I'm right.
---
Good luck actually playing if your pupils were that big. You would need to be like 2 inches from the screen
---
Lol what? I didn’t say anyone was an idiot. I didn’t name call at all. For the record, I’m not the toxicity, it’s most of r/classicwow and it’s been quite the problem to deal with lately. Mods have made that clear. An example is your post. You literally went to my throat and name called me for name calling even though I didn’t. Basically I posted something and it offended people for some reason and they all name called me and you jumped on the band wagon without realizing I didn’t say anything. 
---
Also, Classic WoW is undoubtedly easier than modern WoW. The beta has been making that clearer than ever. Yes, there’s some stuff that’s different, but not in the sense of true difficulty. Streamers know that. Most beta testers know that. The people who don’t? Private server players. That’s why Blizzard keeps having to update their not a bug list. People need to know that enemies are not hitting “too soft”. Players aren’t regenerating too much health. Etc.
---
Then Duskwood was never truly Duskwood because it's as dark on BfA as it was during Vanilla.
---
It's more AQ and Naxx I was hinting at since you need to be committed for these. Both gear and consumable wise.
---
That was awesome!
---
Best class in all kind of pvp if you know what you're doing and also have a knowledge on other vanilla classes.
---
In vanilla, all we have is WSG, AB, and AV. They also don’t become active until phase 3 or 4.
---
Started one week after vanilla was released, and played off and on up until the end of legend. Didn't even bother to touch BFA. 
---
But I think I'm going to have to experience grinding to level 60 for two weeks. That's something worth reliving again.
---
Not necessarily a bad pick if you enjoy playing the class. Sure, horde always trys to take as make shamans as they possibly can (5-8 or so) but if you're skilled/committed, even in a casual sense there's a good chance you'll get gear.
---
Just play what you feel happy with though, because even if you were a casual dps, you'd still run into the same gearing issue. Of course, you could always play Druid as raids generally only run 1-3 mainly because hots don't stack but that's a lot less competition for gear! Same with hunters, it's like 1-2 per raid.
---
We didn't call it Lagforge for nothing. God damn those frames, or lackthereof.

''You could rush to 60, you could show roll it.''
---
unlike classic, there is no benefit to taking it slow or staying at a lower level. the ''real game'' is at max level. the classes feel like shit until max level. the few people at your level are off spamming dungeons or quests and ignoring anything social, because that's a distraction, and they just want to be max level.
---
''You could focus on professions.''
---
which professions provide a real, tangible long-term benefit besides alchemy? and no, crafting a piece of gear that will get replaced in literally an hour does not count.
---
''You could fish.''
---
there were tangible benefits to fishing in current. there were in legion as well, but in bfa people are just going to wonder why you aren't running mythic plus. a chill activity like that feels very out of place in the current game.
---
''You could rep grind.''
---
at least in classic it actually makes sense to rep grind for a while when you can get a seriously good piece of gear that'll last you a long time, and it's an actual choice. not something you do to unlock shitty race recolors, or something you're forced to do to unlock the literal story, or to unlock flying so you can finally navigate badly designed zones.
---
''You could PvP.''
---
for some reason i don't find pvp as enjoyable when all the classes are gutted and there's some bizarre scaling system in the background blizzard won't properly explain so i can be decently geared, whack away at someone for a good amount of time and still not make a dent in their health
---
''Each feels just as rewarding''
---
where do you want to eat? you want gourmet burgers? well what the fuck, why are you being like this? there's a mcdonalds right across the street, we can go there and get even MORE burgers.
---
Derp after reviewing it a few times I def forgot a handful of BC screenshots in here. Otherwise almost all of these pictures are from vanilla on Azgalor.
---
he probably did, but maybe the HS wasn't in the zone he was levelling in
---
Language evolves, its fluid. Get with it.
---
prayer of healing? mind blast?
---
ZHC, toep (unlikely), NAC, Draconic Infused Emblem. You can have +SP trinkets online around the clock when you need it all while keeping your 2nd trinket for utility like netomatic, insignia etc.
---
You basically have a +SP trinket ready when you need it.
---
I’ve been building a guide for myself, this will definitely be useful. If I come across anything else I’ll send it to you. One thing I’m going to look for later is detailed end game raid guides since I never played vanilla.
---
Good ideas - to add on, when you mount up it takes some time to liftoff / reach max speed...  maybe there's 'wind' conditions where most days you must fly close to ground [or take damage], or fly at a certain speed, and some zones have more or less wind on average.  
---
There could be a cheap engineering item that allows dismounts medium-long range, so wPvP can only be avoided by taking a longer route around a zone, and if you are dismounted / die, it is not a quick thing to run away.
---
Also, this is classic, it is more about what you are able to find. I leveled with a hunter back in 2005 and was constantly swapping back and forth depending on what dropped.
---
Awesome job!
---
I SMELL GOLD!
---
In wrath I had a blast using blast wave to knock people off flying mounts for easy kills in winter grasp while farming ore. Until they changed it...
---
What about the people who have no interest in playing / being forced to an expansion?
---
Honestly depends what you want to do. You can max out professions, work on the economy, try to solo stuff, spam dungeons for gear / work on your BiS, relentlessly PvP, go and cause havoc for the opposite faction with a group of friends, grind cash for your epic mount, go fishing, cook said fish - the world is open and it’s up to you what you do!
---
It's been a long time since I played but I remember the last time I played WoW it was way more lit up, it was almost indistinguishable from the day time. Basically just day time lighting with a night time sky box.
---
Yea my time investment is literally a couple bg's a day though so I have no time to farm ANY gear.  Just going to put aside 1 week to get my character to 39 or 49 and get the best gear I can.  
---
And I think you are underestimated how many people raid.  If you dont raid eventually you will get run over in 60 pvp as the phases come out.
---
I mostly agree. Haala on my server during BC however was clustered with world pvp though.
---
My guess is a lot of  these starting zones will be filled with many players. So that will have a bigger impact than anything else for leveling.
---
You've hit the nail on the head, my friend
---
Priest - you'll be respeccing a lot if you're switching between a holy/disc pve setup and a shadow/disc pvp setup. Yes, you could be the token shadow-weaving/disc priest for raids but at the point you're just gimping yourself too much.
---
Warlock - can't argue there. Grindy yes for them soulstones but each to their own.
---
Hunter - Not just deadzone but just being in melee range with a 12 second hamstring or crippling poison on you. Just watch some classic hunter pvp videos or pservers and it may make you feel better!
---
Druid - am biased, playing a druid myself. Versatility/mobility is just amazing. Played one for a few expansions and then switched to monk. Druid is closest to monk in terms of getting around the world/battleground/running away lol.
---
You don't use corruption. You will be keeping up one of three curses, then you will spam shadowbolt. raids are about the group working together, and everyone playing their role, and a warlock's role in raids is to summon, banish, keep up curses, and deal ok damage.
---
For real though. I start classes 10 days before release!
---
If your warrior keeps aggro, daggers would be nice so you're not competing for swords with the warrior but honestly, iirc combat swords is still better overall
---
Every single class gets dumped into barrens/westfall/auberdine/loch modan feeling like you hit a wall. You get there at 12 and quest difficult is ome or two level 12 quests then immediately 14-15.  The mobs hit harder than the leveling zone and the casters can chunk 25% off your health in one cast.  You barely have two greens and thrown into the unpleasant 12-15 range.
---
Because the warrior that is tanking for a dungeon PUG wants the warrior dps drops and doesnt want competition.
---
The nights on the beta are the correct darkness level. The OP posted a screenshot that was likely edited with Night Effect on Photoshop.
---
I tend to die, go back and if they are still there and kill me again I just go do something else for 15-30 minutes. If they want to stand there they can waste their own time, I have other things to do.
---
Even if you only went at 10% speed, it's still a godmode button. There's not getting around that.
---
Actually your going to want to use corruption on cool down, the buff limit is larger as were on 1.12. Shadow bolt spam with life taps when you need mana, the rest is in-competition with other locks, ie stealing crits with deathcoil/shadow burn.
---
The world PvP would be unreal
---
you filled it up.
---
You had one job!
---
Both
---
Just adjusting some talents within the existing system would go a long way. Not even big changes, just numerical tweaks.
---
They will both benefit you and your guild, you can make money off of each but I THINK alchemy will get you money earlier on better than enchanting.
---
Tailoring you can make some pretty good gear for yourself too. 
---
I haven't even figure out which class I'm going with (Still debating on doing a rogue again, mage, or hpally lol) but I've decided to go herb/alch
---
if layers are anything like phases are on retail, it will be hard to manipulate solo but with the help of another person it should be easy.
---
Who care if it releases at 4 PM in US?
---
Dude I want that!
---
Tailoring allows archmage robes early which is ok, but the big deal is the zg set gives a hit bonus that makes them bis through or until(I forget which) naxx.  That isn't until phase 3, but something to think about.
---
If you dont plan on raiding and want to pvp, engr is functionally a requirement.
---
Can you explain?
---
For general leveling, swords &gt; daggers.  In group scenarios where you can backstab to your hearts content; daggers (unless tank sucks like others have mentioned). 
---
Don't be like me 15 years ago though.  I leveled with swords but went subtlety spec.  Yeah sure I had all the cooldowns in the world and can stunlock like a king, but hemorrhaging mobs took \*forever\*.  This time around I'll for sure be going combat (maybe... I still may be stubborn like I was in the past).
---
Lol it will more than run it, I'm running in a similar rig with the gtx1060 and I got anywhere from 120-250 fps with everything maxed out
---
I hate it.    
---
Especially in the Division 2.     
---
You lvl to 30... then you have to lvl up your World Tier? Then agian... and again... and again...    
---
What was the point of the first 30 lvls if I have to do the exact same thing over again.   
---
It all just seems to be busy work to make people think that the game has more content than it actually does.
---
That always keeps me wondering what are those animals using to parry my huge ass sword with spikes
---
As a troll hunter my auto-shot seems bugged today.  Worked fine all day yesterday, but when I started questing this morning he will not auto-shoot, despite it being activated.  I can shoot my main shots (Arcane, aimed, serpent sting) but he will not do a regular auto-shot attack.  My character draws the bow back and just stands there, not shooting unless I cast one of my abilities.
---
Anyone else notice this?  I've relogged multiple times, i have no addons installed, I'm lvl 21, fighting spiders in Stonetalon and this issue was not present last night when I was playing.
---
If it was 10% speed with a height limit I'm pretty sure it would no longer be qol. It might let you do new things, but not old things easier  just there to flex mounts and have flying only areas at that point. Although that slow would look absurd, so potentially there is no way to balance flying that doesn't just feel silly
---
Do you explode with expletives and make rediculus mouth wide open and frozen places when you play? I feel like this sounds like a normal person playing the game not trying to make shock value to get subs.
---
How much do Warlocks and Paladins pay for their regular and epic mounts?
---
Thanks will defo be joining
---
You literally called people hilariously pathetic... I called you an ass for saying that. And you're saying people are wrong based on your own experiences with thw game and that of your friends... Which no one can verify so that is a bit of trolling.
---
I am talking about leveling and questing in classic and I guess I should have specified. PvP is only harder because of things being unbalanced. But raids might very well be harder in retail. 
---
I agree it could seem that I jumped the bandwagon but from the outside it truly just seemed like you were going on about how people are wrong just for the sake of trolling.
---
I like flying. I don't care if it had an effect on wPVP because I don't wPVP (or PVP at all)
---
I'd play TBC again in a heartbeat.
---
We knew from the get-go this was how it was going to be. 
---
Streamers were invited to Blizzard HQ.  
---
Blizzard then release the beta statement detailing how the first round of testing will have a very small amount of invites.
---
That's about as clear as you can get without literally spelling out "DO NOT EXPECT AN INVITE".
---
As for streamers, that's just you showing this is all about envy. It makes every bit of sense to invite streamers.   
---
Not only is it good coverage (promotion), it also means the rest of us have hours upon hours of gameplay footage.   
---
It also means the Classic Dev Team have actual gameplay footage. They can literally (and they have demonstrated doing so) go into a streamer's video and pinpoint when a big supposedly occurred, and see for themselves.
---
To put it succinctly.   
---
How they are handling this beta makes sense from every point of view except yours and that of those equally envious.
---
I'm not trying to be mean but this sentiment is so common here, and it displays nothing short of ignorance and/or entitlement.
---
For what it's worth, I'm also really aching for some gametime.
---
Then why post without doing even a modicum of research into the current night situation? Posts like yours hype up the community for something and it misleads them into thinking BfA is much brighter than Vanilla. They take that misinformation and spread it 10 fold and then we get into a situation where there's a clamoring for nights to be darker on Classic, despite them being exactly the same as they were in Vanilla.

"Consensus" is such a broad term, especially if you plan to be a part of a raid dynamic.  If everyone took engineering + &lt;insert profession that allows better equipment here&gt;, there would be no alchemists, which are invaluable to a raid's success.
---
Do not feel obligated to be shoehorned into a profession that you see little value in, maybe this will help:
---
Engineering--If you plan to take PVP seriously, this is absolutely required.  It helps in PVE as well, but not enough to really be considered "mandatory" unless you are skilled enough to top meters and want that little extra "oomph".
---
Tailoring--As a Warlock, being able to equip the Bloodvine set is the real deal, as all 3 pieces are BiS until Naxx.  You need 300 in Tailoring to get the 2% crit bonus, which is pretty nice.  Further, you can craft yourself the BoP Robe of the Void, which is BiS until I believe BWL (and the Bloodvine Vest will be available shortly after).  For PVE, I think Tailoring is more important than Engineering, and even if it is close, Tailoring can certainly make gold with Mooncloth transmutes, bags, etc.
---
So yeah, both engineering and tailoring are strong.  But what about the others?
---
Skinning--Only take this if you plan to do a TON of grinding on your leveling journey; if you plan on questing or using dungeons to level, it loses its luster.  The profit per piece of leather is pretty small, but every slain skinnable mob is a "node", so it is consistent in performance and easy to level.
---
Leatherworking--Only consider this if you are a skinner, and even then I would not take it, since you will be making goods you cannot really use.
---
Herbalism--There are quite a few nodes, many valuable types of herbs to farm, and they are always in demand from alchemists to make valuable potions.  This is a great way to make gold once the endgame begins, although you may struggle to sell some initially as everyone levels.
---
Alchemy--Pairs extremely well with herbalism, although you can take it anyway and still use it as a way to make some extra gold with transmutes and using the AH/fishing/mob loot to gain ingredients.  Every guild needs alchemists!
---
Mining--The high-variance gathering profession; there are few nodes, and not all of them are particularly valuable, so it is a real pain to level.  However, once you know what sells and how to mine it, it can be a great way to make gold...but it is quite a time investment and can be a pain competing with rival miners.
---
Blacksmithing--See leatherworking, only replace "skinning" with "mining".
---
Enchanting--Everyone needs enchants at level 60 (and some people cannot help themselves prior to 60), but to realize the profession's full value, you need to be able to sell your services in chat.  Disenchanting can be done by a level 5 alt, so that alone is not a reason to take enchanting.
---
These are my opinions; ultimately you should not feel pressured to take the professions you see as the most valuable to your personal experience.
---
This is exactly the situation. It's too late for them to take it out now, so it's better for them to just accept the damage it has done and start afresh.
---
So... How you react to it? That's a really wise saying.
---
I only share my.opinion up to TBC and maybe WotLK. Also I think upgrade the BC to WotLK, not keeping just BC server, that should be an honor only for a classic. I haven't thought this through particularly well.
---
I hope there is a balanced solution, as some of my best memories in WoW were flying over beautiful landscapes, really having freedom of movement to see the world from any height.  Sure, flightpaths, but it's not really the same.
---
Also druid flightform was great fun.
---
I'm afraid to risk getting a ban from the classic game come August.
---
Same. Pve 💯
---
I recall them dropping it in Vanilla.  I went there to farm it once, but the drop rate sucked, and there were other people there.  It just wasn't worth my time.
---
2006 Nihilum is comparable to a modern day casual guild.
---
Healing too!!  
---
I had to keep the tank barely alive so I didn't go oom mid fight... or at least that's how I used to play it...     
---
I might of been just a bad healer....
---
Yea its weird. Every mob can parry but not every class
---
Yeah, those are my thoughts as well, and as someone who always takes herbalism I am hoping that it holds true.  Thank you for the reply!
---
Professions: there are some benefits.  Tailor for caster comes to mind, for instance.  The bloodline set bonus requires tailoring, and that is BiS for locks.  There are other epic tailoring needs.  Engineering is incredibly important for PvP (reflectors, breaking sheep) and PvE (jumper cables, repair bots, resist trinkets).
---
Fishing: it had mp5 food and alchemy reagents for caster damage and tanking potions.  
---
You can roll PvE if that is what you like. Many people will still PvP for upgrades, such as Lei of the Lifegiver from AV.
---
All of the mentioned stuff benefits my real goal of raiding endgame.  It isn't just about showing up for me. I want to work for something I might fail at, otherwise I might as well just write blizzard a check for gear.  Much like every hour of lecture requires a certain amount of hours of studying, every raid deserves a certain amount of prep.  That is where I find the best part of this game.  By doing that, you are invested and immersed in your character
---
The perfect berserker mentality! What good is dead when you can make it EXTRA dead?
---
Well i dont disagree, warlocks are strong in 1v1. but unless you are prepared and have the right pet up for the class you face you can definitely be beaten by a couple specs. warriors and rogues comes to my mind here.  i just think shamans have a particular disadvantage due to insanely long cast times vs warlocks and no means to dispell curses.  you probably wont get a single cast off if the warlock is skilled  
---
But while warlocks can be argued against every class, shamans as i mentioned have a larger number of counters than just that, mostly due to relying on hardcasting to be relevant, while not having means to guarantee it, unlike mages with improved counterspell/nova/(except against rogues), and warlocks with instant CC and succubus pet.
---
Normal mounts are free.
---
Epic mounts with their quest are still expensive. 
---
For Paladin you need: 150g, 40 runecloth, 6 arcanite bars, 10 arthas tears, 5 strathhold holy water vials, and another 150g
---
Yes, it absolutely is, flying was the whole reason myself and all my friends left WoW in the first place. Stating that people blow it out of proportion is inaccurate, because for a large quantity of people, it was damaging to the core game experience.
---
Guys, it was only the AH's and habit. People saying it was IF because of whatever, no dude it was that it had an AH. When they added AH's everywhere I remember a ton of people moved to SW, it was always as popular if not more than IF. SW isn't that bad either, people pretending like it's optimal to use IF forget a bunch of stuff SW is better for, they'll both only ever be a few minutes difference from each other anyway because of the tram, so it really doesn't matter which you use.
---
Because this subreddit fucking THIRSTS for anti BFA/retail shit. Doesnt even matter if its true. They want validation to hate anything post BC
---
Like others have said, it's not gonna happen.
---
Remember then Blizzard said Vanilla won't be happening?  - Yeah, stay hopeful, I will be. :)
---
If you're going Alliance and like the Night Elf mounts, I'll be farming (like I have done in retail) for the Winterspring Frostsaber.  It's an armor-less tiger with neon white/purple colors—I can't wait to have it again with Classic.  This time I'll be human so I can knock off almost 100 times I have to repeat that damn quest for the reputation.
---
Sadly I did not like the space-y design of TBC very much and the Dungeon design was actually kinda lacking. The Dungeons were memorable because they were a nice challenge but TBC marked the death of actually well designed dungeon LAYOUT.
---
Since TBC all dungeons have been tubes. Hell they even went back to classic dungeons and mutilated them into tubnes. In classic we had shit like SM, Mauradon, BRD, Stratholme... which were all so fucking huge you could get lost in them. All classic dungeons really needed were better boss designs. The straightening of the layouts was just cost efficient. It REEKS of saving money. 
---
It also entirely killed off Battlegrounds (outside of AV honor farming) with Arenas as the only source of high end PvP gear and PvP Power/Defense totally destorying any chance for a PvE person to hop into a BG every now and then. How fucking frustrating was it to start a new char and hop into a BG just to get entirely DEMOLISHED with no chance to fight back because their health regen was literally higher than the damage you could deal to them while they also literally 1 or 2shot you.
---
Leveling was also kinda awful. Probably the worst leveling expansion ever. No other expansion made me so averse to leveling another char as TBC. Hellfire Peninsula alone was SO AWFUL ugh. The bland visuals (fitting but still) coupled with the underdeveloped leveling (Wrath actually was the first expansion to have an enjoyable leveling experience - story wise and 'have enough quests'. Of course Classic was much better in terms of difficulty and pacing)
---
I hold TBC in high esteem for the difficulty (last expansion to actually make you learn and play the game) and raids, but other than that it wasn't exactly my expansion at all.
---
Ty will try.  This is the content I’m here for, gimmicks and semi exploits lol
---
We are on the larger debuff limit as its 1.12 based
---
 Esfand  is  such a nice guy and fun to watch!
---
I used to follow him on tumblr before it was dead. He went by tediferious or something like that. Cool dude — the meme was always a meme, it wasn’t a genuine reaction to something. He made the first few himself, I don’t remember what they were about but they blew up on tumblr and spread from there. This dates way back to like 2011 or so.
---
Hard to say definitively that they are the least popular because you don't know the faction % from that poll. Class proportions could vary based on faction.
---
Let's say that number of warlocks is split in half to demonstrate warlock popularity between the factions. The Paladin is only playable on Ally, so that would then indicate more Paladin's than warlocks on your faction.
---
There’s a ton of really great Druid anchors on our server bro. It’s almost impossible to control a Druid and moon fire is dank af for interrupting. 
---
That said a lot of classes have decent toolkit’s. I’m a holy pala and often get left on a flag cause I can live so long that backup has time to rotate
---
Not entirely true. Since we will have 16 debuff slots there will be room for corruption slots
---
I started bfa 3 months ago and gotta say got bored really quick i stopped playing 2 weeks ago, classic is easier to get into and slow progression will help you understand the game better. When i boosted my character i barely knew my class and i certainly didnt know other classes. It took alot of time to learn everything and people would shit talk me alot for not knowing. My advice do a bit of research and play some pvp at every stage to maxlevel to learn other classes/races while you level
---
Everyone is one the same footing -- with nothing.
---
Its the first (and best) iteration of the game where the gameplay is focused on literally doing anything you want within it.  The biggest part of the game is just playing it and leveling it up. With no dailies to keep up with, players can actually do whatever the hell they want, when they want, and how they want without ever actually "falling behind" or losing out on missing anything.
---
Someone is bound to give you a more accurate answer but until then, I believe the regular level 40 mount is pretty much free (just have to pay the cheap cost to learn riding and maybe pay for the skill to summon it, like any other spell) but the level 60 one is a lengthy quest that involves gathering various reagents you might end up buying off the AH as well as outright paying the quest giver.
---
Most classes will pay 1000 gold for the mount alone without any rep bonus (most people will have some kind of rep discount by then I think) and Paladins and Warlocks won't come in too much cheaper than that honestly, maybe 750 - 850 gold in comparison? I might be way wrong on that though but the 60 mount is not at all free.
---
I’ve linked platinum to all of my old friends I’ve been trying to get hyped and without exception it’s worked perfectly. 
---
He also finally got into beta afaik??
---
4:46
---
never watched that one :) awesome
---
Sounds like the BFA beta schedule. Starting class reworks right before release
---
I mean, apparently very many people enjoy facerolling content so I guess those were kinda happy with the mind numbingly unchallenging 'heroic' dungeons
---
While this could be really cool, I'm actually really worried about how Activision blizzard would do with this approach. They haven't proved to me that they can release new wow content that is on par with the old stuff. That's why I'm more interested in it progressing into TBC , at least I know that the game still holds up. I don't want classic to have new content that is similar to retail.
---
BC had arguably some of the best class talents available without being too OP. I agree with you about dungeon design it was definitely the raids, Karazhan in particular, that stood out to me. Vanilla dungeons were the best, especially BRD,Scholomance and Stratholme.
---
Or people just think your arguments are weak and that's why you're being downvoted. Maybe you should look inward and reflect instead of resorting to name-calling (which is the fastest way to show you've lost the debate).
---
???????
---
The amount of eligible players that are subbed to retail is the same. Tnhe amount that got in has n effecyw
---
There’s a bunch of areas in the existing map (at least for EK) that can fit whole zones and even have assets already. Quel’Thalas, the Twilight Highlands, Gilneas. Obviously they’d need work from the versions that came to retail but there’s places to extend and expand the classic world. Hyjal is an obvious choice, but Uldum maybe just slot a dungeon in there. I don’t think that zone is redeemable. 
---
Dungeons too. A bunch of the Cata dungeons could be repurposed whole sale - Deepholm, Al’Akir, the Nepulon one, Firelands. 
---
Broader itemization options and some talent adjustments would be great. Like Druid and Paladin tanks could be viable for more content with more gear options and a few talent tweaks. 
---
The Vanilla framework can accommodate a bigger and more class-inclusive game through the systems that already exist it just needs to be fleshed out.
---
I would say go arms even if you wanna rock sword and board. The talents are just better at lower levels it seems in fury
---
Well, it shouldn't be your *only* objective. The average gamer should simply play as normal and *report* anything amiss that they come across.
---
No, it's not early access at all. And people treating it as such are wrong. But as usual the truth lies in the middle instead of the extreme ends.
---
I heard from another big streamer that he actually had to email blizzard asking to be invited when he should have been one of the first streamers invited as he is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about vanilla and can beta test the game very well.
---
Skinning is pretty much the only profession you can level with and not lose a significant amount of time working on it. People who want to level fast level without professions. It takes many hours of mining to even raise the skill to 300, let alone getting real value out of it. If you don't care about leveling fast, you can just pick whatever professions you think are interesting. It's essentially impossible for any profession (aside from first aid) to actually *help* you level, it's always a time loss but skinning is a pretty small loss.
---
Murlocs and kobolds are the most fucking annoying 2 mobs in any video game history, and anyone who has any affection for their purposely annoying, dare I say "Jar Jar esque" cancer design is subhuman.
---
\#ChangeMyMind
---
100%
---
I think about this often
---
They're using the pre 1.12 version.
---
Sell tanking service. Once the server has some gold, you'll be surprised what people will pay
---
He's just a good content creator. 
---
He doesn't try to make himself out to be a God of WoW like some streamers, he's just a normal guy who's played WoW a lot.
---
Chill dude /10
---
I don't think they stream TBC or Wrath arena so I doubt it.
---
Really seems to be that way.
---
I just spam annoying comments
---
Ah right, talents. Totally forgot to consider that. Yea I really really liked those. Also first time they tried an "all specs viable" approach. (=! bring player not class, which I'm not so fond off)
---
Class design wise TBC was certainly a step in the right direction.
---
Now that they introduced the alchemy usable that was exploited super hard early on and got everyone insane amount of pots and cauldrons? Sure.
---
Pots being 400-600g/ea until that was released? Flasks were the same price as flasks, that's how retardedly hard pots were to farm. AK was disabled when it mattered the most making the grind retarded, and it still is. Any player that wanted to use pots on every pull, flasks for a 3h raid and food would easily spend 25k+ gold a night.
---
I only wear cloth in dungeons and stuff. 
---
In PvP / in the world I’m 6/ judgement at all times haha
---
People claim engineering is "required" for pvp, but back in vanilla I knew plenty of people that pvpd full time and didn't have it. Don't get me wrong, it is helpful, but so is making gold and getting your epic mount.
---
23 fps, true old school content
---
When everyone is starting out new, they have no money.    I don't think you will be able to sell those greens for much.  But maybe I am wrong, idk.  The advice on the PTR is always to just vendor the leather.
---
Long cds, no cloak so dying to dots is common, no durability while vanish and evasion are on their long cds. Harder to stealth due to afore-mentioned dot issue so easier to be opened on by a ranged that doesn’t let you catch up to them
---
TBH i don't expect classic to last. I think they should just do fresh servers every now and again or open TBC servers (which will probably kill classic). I don't usually play a game more than a few months (wow being the exception) so getting 2+ years of enjoyment is fine by me.
---
Disarm trap
---
3 things.
---
Why would you feel the need to tell people you enjoy BFA?
---
Join a guild that is social instead of some troglodyte utopia.
---
BFA community is FAR FAR FAR FAR worse, since you are no one now. Just a realm-name passing by through the world or the LFG system.
---
Don't worry.
---
you will also soul stone and health stone and 2 of you will need to do curse of elements or curse of shadows.
---
Screen it, report it, attach it. They'll take care of it.
---
I happen to be gay. I don't get offended easily and work to ignore most shit, or see trash talk as trash talk. But there are always people who take it too far, or simply do it *constantly.* It doesn't matter what the subject is, if its relentless, it'll get tiresome. 
---
Luckily their behavior will not be tolerated on official servers. Report and get back to your life. :)
---
Yeah, guess you'll just have to deal with it or stop watching lol.
---
Most Classes spam 1-2 buttons.
---
So when people like the OP say things like ‘get dark nights BACK’ they are incorrect that we ever had them?
---
UD Spriest on purple undead steed is top tier aesthetics. Makes me torn between priest and lock for classic.
---
Would also recommend "the perkulator" he released several movies and they were all entertaining
---
&gt; Blizzard then release the beta statement detailing how the first round of testing will have a very small amount of invites.
---
Nowhere does it say it's going to be a very small amount of invites. If you want to blindly suck their dick it's up to you, but don't make shit up.
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
&gt; As for streamers, that's just you showing this is all about envy.
---
No, it's about being fair. Inviting streamers only objectively makes it unfair. Of course they don't have to be fair, but I also don't have to be happy with it. Myself and many other players would have a lot more to contribute than a streamer like Pokimane, lmao. Sure blizzard wants as many normies as they can get to try classic, that doesn't excuse them only inviting streamers.
---
&gt; Nobody said anything about seeking the infinitely perfect program.
---
You pretty much did by disagreeing with the statement:
---
&gt; They are going to have bugs today that won't be fixed until after release. The nature of video game development is that it's full of bugs many of which don't get fixed and are considered minor. 
---
The only way that you could be correct in disagreeing with that is if they were to ship a perfect piece of software, fixing every single bug that exists in the current beta, no matter how minor. Which again, is not possible.
---
&gt; It really is possible to work on a game longer to get a more complete product on release.
---
Of course, it's possible to make it "more complete", but it is absolutely not possible to make it fully complete. At some point, they have to decide that they have reached a state where they are willing to ship. At some point, the costs of making it "more complete" outweigh the benefit, especially when they have the ability to deliver fixes effectively at a later date.
---
FROSTSOCK!!
---
Is there some type of Thorn spec/armor set for Druids? Like if I put talent points into that Improved Thorns in resto and than the rest in feral to tank. Is there gear for more Thorn damage and is this viable to use in dungeons to do more damage and threat?
---
I'm honestly torn between Fury Warrior or Holy Paladin at the moment. I'll probably play both, but I don't know which to focus on. The warrior will be able to grind solo mobs way faster, and it's what I mained back in vanilla 1.12 so there's some nostalgia there, but the paladin will be nigh ungankable with Redoubt and all the free escape abilities, and I'll be able to AoE farm and do lasher runs of DM East when it comes out.
---
Yea that might do it, or you can just mess around in STV and gank your enemies. Depends how much one cares about pvp, I enjoy the guild fights in BRM and wpvp during leveling, but then I don't care much, I can imagine there are more people like me.
---
Well to be honest... an RPG really isn't that fun to watch unless your into the story or raiding/pvping.    
---
I had lots of fun in the stress test lvling to 5 but I can see why someone might say it looks boring if they've never played it before.       
---
That being said, looking at how many people were in the stress test I don't think Classic is going to die out anytime soon.
---
If streamers make up a more signficant portion of the people on the beta, then removing streamers and letting others in, does change how  much that improves your own odds
---
Say there's 1 million people that want in. 
---
1thousand gets in, say 500 of those are streamers.
---
That means you have a 0.5% chance of getting in as not streamer. If streamers are removed then the chance is dobbled to 1%
---
Say on another server server streamers make up 500 out of 550, then your chances of getting in as not streamer is 0.05%, but if you remove streamers it is 0.55%, which is 10 times the chance.
---
So although the overall chance is lowered by the beta being smaller, it also does mean that the difference between streaming being let in or not is more significant to your chances of getting in yourself.
---
CoR too
---
I see you're a letter of the law kind of guy.
---
I prefer to go by what a person is communicating instead of intentionally misunderstanding things by going with the technically correct version of a person's casual word choice.
---
Yeah I've booked 2 with the possibility of an extra 2 days if I can't have MC cleared before the 2nd reset
---
Swords.   The warrior probably won't be able to hold aggro off of you, so backstab won't work more than once.
---
Thorns is considered pretty much useless. Improved thorns is a waste of talent points. Natural weapons, natural shapeshifter or even improved mark of the wild are all better for example.
---
So its fair to say level with combat mostly/swords and when you reach 60 if your intention is to pvp more go a dagger route ?
---
Smartest thing they can do is release a new hive every year and progress each hive through every phase/xpack progressive
---
I mean, if someone doesnt like any other expansions then they propably aren't playing anyway. So there's no point in argumenting that it would split community hence it already is
---
It is possible
---
youre not in my head that bad. You do you 💩
---
I do at least appreciate youre having fun
---
It wouldn't be THAT easy. You would have to find someone that is willing to go through the frustration of possibly having to relog until they are in a different layer. And then when you want to swap, you'd have to have someone your guild invite you to the original layer, which would put the other person on that layer too if they stay with you, and then you have to have then relog until they get in the second layer. Also, chances are, there will only be 2 layers per continent on any given server. 
---
Not to mention, if people try to make an Add-on to automate this, Blizzard will block the functionality. 
---
I'm really not worried about it. They have been faithful to us thus far, so why would we have any reason to doubt their intentions so far.
---
BFA trade chat is the same. If blizzard started banning as much as you think, BFA would have less life than Pripyat. People need thicker skin way more than a reliance on blizzard's mods. Not saying they don't ban though.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/

https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/
---
The thing you need to understand about Vanilla raids is that they were not designed with having 40 competent BiS players.
---
Even back in the day, Nihilum were great, but they were still new to the scene. Naxx is being cleared within the first night by hardcore guilds on private servers as soon as they open.
---
This is going to happen on classic too, because people not only know how to play the game better but they are going to be fully prepared on every single character, with all consumables, all resistances, all buffs that they can stack, with previous experiences doing the raids multiple times on Pservers and they are going to roll it.
---
A good amount of guilds will do this, it'll take some more casual guilds slower, ofcourse. But every single raid will be complete within the same day of release, I will guarantee it. Literally quote me on this.
---
If you don't think this is going to happen you're in for quite a shock to realise that the raids aren't as difficult mechanically as you think they are. They just take extra prep and the moment you give guilds 14 years of information to prepare for something, then you'll see.
---
!Remindme 6 months
---
I can't think of a better time to start WoW.
---
It's the best pve gear.
---
And they've got more guards roaming around in case you need something. And! Lots of those dwarven pyres scattered around, always easy to cook when you need to. Truly the best capital city. Wish my friends were playing alliance for this reason. My alt will be a dwarf though.
---
Another reason there is such preference for swords is that by the time you are filling out your talent tree there are a series of quest reward swords that last most rogues from about 38 to basically 60.

Equally good daggers are very hard to come by.
---
That isn't an issue in vanilla. They don't have sharding. If you're on the same server, you'll see each other in the world.
---
Rogue is pretty fun in world pvp. You can lurk on people and gank when you decide you want to, plus you can leave when you want.
---
What does manage alts mean?
---
This. People need to take their nostalgia glasses off.
---
Oh yeah good point about the guards they are also closer together since IF is all inside and a bit more compact, better to fight horde hehehe
---
Thank you for the warcrafttavern link!
---
Then they can go back to retail or find a different game.
---
Retail is where future development belongs; not classic.
---
That's a good point. I played on an established server and people were generally pretty respectful but I switched over to a fresh realm and the amount of blatant racism and racial slurs constantly being bandied about in world chat was pretty unsettling
---
Coz it's meant to come out at the same moment worldwide. Here in Europe it's coming out at midnight... Which is great for me, as it means there'll be less people online 2-3h in than if release had been prime-time
---
Different clients dude
---
Find a priest buddy and leveling turns from horrible to entertaining.
---
&gt; nsane gear repair bills
---
Pretty sure that was fixed part way through vanilla, wasn't it?

you can't reset an instance when players are inside of it.

never heard of him
---
What a ride that sub was... Wow...
---
&gt; flying was the whole reason myself and all my friends left WoW in the first place.
---
Yeah, nah. That's a load of bullshit. Flying really wasn't that bad. If other people enjoying something you don't bothers you so much you should reconsider your priorities.
---
There's 16 debuff slots from the start, instead of 8 until ZG. That'll make MC/BWL somewhat easier, but that's mostly relevant for BWL as MC would probably be trivial either way.
---
The PvP gear will be the 1.12 version from the start. If that means what it sounds like it means, PvP gear will be so overpowered for many months that it skews the entire game. I mean, the epic set is equivalent to T2.5 and it'll become available in phase 2. Unless that phase is extremely short, people will start to have full gear comparable to T2.5 before BWL even opens. That's going to be a gigantic deal in Classic but nobody really seems to care.
---
We need flight combat to bring people to the ground.
---
most of the time you don't know how good something is until it's gone
---
Perplexity
---
Are guards immune? I saw an UD priest MCing guards in Arathi near the AB entrance. Pserver though
---
Uhhh Druids are awesome tanks
---
That is 100% incorrect for 40 man raids. Irc there are 8 debuffs which increase damage for the whole raid. 
---
Then you bring in damage mitigation which has 2. This leaves 6 slots for things like hunters mark, spriest debuffs, judgements. You don't use corruption
---
Good shit
---
If you go to Classicwow.live and search “written” in the search box it will filter all of their guides to only written ones.
---
Take the 15min during the early rush to take a shower, eat something or just stretch your legs. Ain't gonna last long without small breaks here and there
---
True.  Endgame has nothing to do with content.  Its all about keeping 40 raiders motivated and engaged.  I am planning on going ret, but im gonna go hardcore with gearing and consumes and world buffs so others cant complain about my spec.  Offspec players should be more hardcore than rogue or mage players.  And thats the issue.  Most offspec players are not hardcore enough to play the spec.  The ones that show up to raid without trying is what shapes the offspec memes.
---
Honestly, I can see why people liked legion. It was good. Not for me, but good. BfA however is objectively trash and almost insulting to the playerbase. It deserves all this hate
---
&gt;People need thicker skin way more than a reliance on blizzard's mods.
---
Or blizzard could do a good job and remove people calling for people of a different race to be murdered and raped by thousands of people until their corpse explodes with the purification of the massive load of cum. That is the disgusting shit you see said every 1-2 min on these servers, not about having a thick or thin skin. If the ToS has rules to prevent these things it shouldn't be up to a player's skin thickness, it should be up to the rule enforcer.
---
Method Scripe. No bullshit, just mage gameplay.
---
Thanks. I live in the US. It’s actually 12 weeks but I’m splitting it in 2 blocks.
---
It’ll be pretty cool having 16 slots in classic MC. It’ll make things easier but we will have more room for class expression like shadow priests and warlock corruption. I’m sure there’s more but I don’t know what other classes have been holding back on big debuff
---

---
Esfand is by far my favorite, super humble guy
---
I mailed a Druid in vanilla. I was rank 12 Pvp and o played Pvp and PvE as both a Resto druid and feral Druid. I MTed all of ZG, AQ 20, MC (Minus Rag) and most of BWL. Druids can MT as good as a warrior if not better with the right gear. Certain fights though it makes no sense to use a Druid tank.
---
BiS pre raid robe of the void is bind on pickup and made from tailoring. BiS later on is bloodvine and the set bonus requires 300 tailoring
---

---
What class or classes would you recommend for someone new to WOW?
---
No thank you, I'd rather use words correct when I can, than use them complete faulty. 
---
2+2 = literally nothing makes me look stupid
---
It really was that fucking bad.
---
I think it's telling that BC was probably the closest in design to vanilla as it was the first expansion, the design ethos definitely got less hardcore and RPGish each expansion after. It also had a fair bit of content that was originally designed for vanilla but got bumped up to it, Karazhan for example was originally designed to be the 20 man counterpart to Naxx. Personally I'd be happy if we got that version in classic eventually, along with the 41 point trees as we got them the patch before BC and because of the level 60 restriction they were decently well balanced even pre-BC.
---
Damn, i remember this. I think someone recommended rerolling a rogue because they do it from behind.
---
I’m not trolling I just get tired of providing evidence in every post. I figure if someone cares to find out, they can look stuff up themselves. 
---
Questing wasn’t really harder, but without an add on you didn’t know where stuff was. That’s all. 
---
Leveling is looked at as harder, but people often forget that when an expansion comes out, we only get 10 more levels. Not 60. World First was level 60 in a week from launch of game. People have learned faster leveling methods nowadays. World first will be faster than a week at launch of Classic. Basically you’re barely spending more time than it takes to only get 10 levels at an expansion launch. 
---
There is not a single shed of backable evidence suggesting leveling is actually harder. People aren’t comparing objectively. The nostalgia has to win for whatever reason.
---

Depends on your definition of "dark nights." They were never, ever as dark as the OP's picture of Mulgore. People think Duskwood was another of those "really dark" zones. Here's a video posted in 2006 of Duskwood at night (you can tell by the Moon icon on the minimap):

WoW on its own doesn't use much if your client is up to date. I used to tether occasionally for raids when my internet went to shit, and I only have 4GB/month, never went over because of it (or came close). Just make sure windows is set to a metered connection so you don't get a random Windows Update or something.
---
Not just the nights. I am hoping to get the weather effects back. That rain and fog in mulgore was great...
---
Nooooo, we don’t need any more locks :P
---
/2 WTB, paying well PST.
---
this looks terrible though
---
only 3 types of people in this world that will tell you the brutal truth. Kids, Drunk people, and someone pissed the fuck off.
---
No. God no. No. No. 
---
I played vanilla. Everyone told me I would be the guilds druid healer. Figured y waste gold on a respec. 
---
First toon so had no idea how bad and slow it was. Then I eventually rolled an alt.
---
I hated myself realising how many hours I wasted.
---
Not alexensual..oh wait hes not playing wow classic anymore cause its bad.. trololol
---
*cries in druid*
---
That's ok. This is what they will end up doing because It's what people want.
---
I know this sounds kind of dickish but what do you expect us to say, no? lol
---
This is the best time to pick up WoW in 11 years, in all honesty.
---
LOL. I was holy/disc. Mind blast is not in rotation. I probably used it there (not even going to go back and check) once that 5v5 was 5v1 and was just tossing it in for fun.
---
BTW, when we called people clickers back then, it's because they literally clicked every ability.
---
The one you think sounds the most awesome. Its a role playing game.
---
Looks really nice , looking forward to seeing more!
---
Yes exactly. Let the vanilla folks ahve their classic let TBC players have their TBC, wrath etc.
---
It would fragment the community if they just update the main server to tbc, the classic only crowd would go back to private servers.
---
I think most of the people that are saying yes are actually saying: “Yes, on August 27th”
---
UPDATE:  
---
I just want to make this clear as some people are getting a little nasty about my wife saying she’s evil and some stuff that isn’t right. I made this post as a “funny” my wife is a very intelligent woman that doesn’t share the same hobby as me and is in the realm of video games are stupid.  So she sighed when I told her this. She has no understanding of my hobby, she thinks it’s a dumb hobby, but she doesn’t stop me, she allows me to do my thing as she knows it’s something I enjoy. I also think her scrap book retreats are stupid and also sigh when she watches the Kardashians. Yet we both go about our lives allowing each other to enjoy our own things.  Probably the secret to our love to be honest.
---
Warlock and hunter are by far the easiest classes to level and both have some cool class quests.
---
Avoid warrior and paladin for your first character if you're leveling solo.  Warrior has a lot of downtime between fights and paladin is rather tedious during fights.
---
Awesome, never tried it with wow (never had a widescreen besides at work)
---
They do iirc!
---
4 movies, the best
---
About the only value to thorns is a bit of threat padding when tanking, and even that's iffy.

Technically it would be 1.14 since classic will be running on 1.13.

I like Esfand because he's nice. Same with Gothalion.

Ziqoftw if you want to watch a rank 1 mage do stuff

Damn, only a 200iq big brain would come up with that play after playing the game 12 hours a day for 15 years
---
People always talk about how you act will determine if you're invited to anything and how people treat you, if that's the case with classic server then a ton of these people, including the toxic people on this sub won't be invited to anything.
---
I would buy this. Kudos to this nice painting !
---
This is part of why I quit in TBC and I'll probably quit again if they decide to do TBC Classic.
---
Releasing an NA game in NA at the busiest time of the day (people out of school/work) seems counter productive to the idea of reducing server stress and whatnot. If they did a 6am NA, 12 noon EU release fewer people would be able to log in at first. 🤷‍♂️
---
That's also a common joke in the car enthusiast community
---
Yeah I was there to witness the death of socialization in dungeons. When the finder dropped everyone was still friendly and chatty, by the end of the expansion it was silence unless anybody made a mistake and then it was people yelling at them

Chill Mage gameplay with PvP focus.
---
My subscription isn't active, as I'm not into retail anymore.
---
Am I eligible for the beta if I start paying again ? Or is there any other criteria to be picked ?
---
These are extreme cases and i doubt they will last. But the occasional "F-you" isn't banable. I mean you need a thicker skin. You should see some realms (BFA) trade chats or Path of Exile global channel 1. Racial slurs and homosexual jokes aren't going anywhere. 
---
You can't ban or silence everyone, except the more serious offenders like in your example.
---
I mean, I disagree with the spirit of the comments as well. I don't think that the standard has significantly changed. Old games had plenty of bugs, modern games have plenty of bugs. Old games had to meet release deadlines, modern games have to meet release deadlines. The only real change has been from a singular release model to a more continuous development, support and enhance, model. And this shift has happened across the software development industry because it leads to better software in the long run.
---
I loved handing out buffs on my druid and running into a mage that had extra water to give out
---
Let's agree to disagree. The guild I'm in currently is ranked within the top 500 and I have been spending consumables during 2 raid nights per week and consistent m+ for the entirety of BFA and I'm by no means a rich player. I can say out of personal experience I have to invest a lot less time to play competitivly than I had to even on vanilla pservers for 3 years. Skill wise the raids are harder in retail ofcourse but hands down time investment is not unless you're in top 100 or something.
---
Yep. Exact same thing here. Really unfortunate as I don't have time to level a new character between work. But this makes hunters basically unplayable
---
Actually WoW was REALLY fucking dark waaay back before 1.2. 
---
IIRC WoW nights went through 3 phases the first being like, really fucking dark beyond functionality in an MMO.
---
Second was the night everybody remembers and wants back.
---
[Third is what we have now.](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2431924-lakeshirecomparison.jpg)
---
I don't think any screenshots of the first night even exist because it hardly lasted that long at all.
---
Mother of God.
---
I don't know how this isn't something I'd considered yet, what with everything else to think about when it comes to Classic(Release patches as things were? What about progression? Do we go into TBC? Re-release everything? Where does it end?) But it might be really cool if they tried taking the other fork in the path; what if we went left instead of right at the end of Vanilla?
---
No. You will use ritual of summoning, conjure healthstones, life tap, and keep up a curse as well. But 95% of your casts are shadowbolt.
---
Besides that one time he called another streamer a “pathetic loser” because he watched a clip of them out of context.
---
In Vanilla, tamable named mobs were more powerful than their regular counterpart. Is it still the case in 1.12/Classic ?
---
What do you need explained? It’s all pretty straight forward.
---
You need to do /console fxglow0
---
60% flying was a good balance imo. You had to use the speed of your slower mounts if you wanted the advantage of being able to fly
---
Epic speed and epic epic speed were a mistake
---
Can't blame them.
---
thanks
---
Exact same thing here .... thinking about taking off the first few days of release and getting to finally play makes me so happy
---
Its not but you need to use fxglow0 to fix it
---
Pretty sure he was replying to the guy who said you can do everything in your comment in retail aswell. Then used your points to prove him wrong.
---
Are there books about the developers and behind the scenes of developing WoW? How it all came to be or any good videos for interviews to which i can learn from about the original WoW? Do you know anything yourself that you heard?
---
Youre just like me.  WPVP is the best but its inconsistent.  Only fun when leveling because you are in the zones anyway.  Anyway BG's fill the void and its consistent.  Ill just be playing Arathi Basin 1 or 2 times a day and thats it pretty much.
---
Yes you get to start off with everyone else. While most people will who have played will be ahead of the curve, you will get to experience for the first time. There is nothing like it. Also there are so many outside resources websites/videos that can help beginners get into the grove.
---
Please go look at how blizzard handled BFA beta. Yes, I agree with layering. I don't agree with me not seeing Rag in SW and others can. That's my arguement. If that can't happen, layering has failed.
---
TBC or kill thec classic? I'd go with TBC. If there is anyone i would trust with making more horizontal progression, that would be the original Vanilla team, and they aren't here. And if i learnt something in 15 years of WoW, it's that listening to the community is bad idea.
---
&gt;I mean you need a thicker skin. You should see some realms (BFA) trade chats or Path of Exile global channel 1. Racial slurs and homosexual jokes aren't going anywhere.
---
No people need to learn to read and follow the rules, I don't go out wearing a bullet proof vest because the government tries to prevent/punishes people who murder. 
---
I mean you need more empathy.
---
Warlocks get some leeway to DOT up trash mobs, especially secondary and tertiary targets.
---
Even with 16 slots there is not room for individual DoTs from players
---
from a forum post:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/16-debuff-slots-what-are-the-most-optimal-debuffs/50870/6
---
And block.
---
Yes you could
---
You don’t have to view the thread you know.
---
Just get thicker skin, bro. We all deal with toxicity no matter what game you play. But the classic crowd is more mature than most games statistically.
---
Kevin Jordan is great to check out. Original Vanilla WoW designer. Did the vast majority of the work on classes.
---
Especially if you only rnd up using 1 stack of retal
---
No, the site says you need an active sub to get into the beta.
---
I don't get how it would make sense to add new Classic content after BC.
---
So clearly, although this topic has been discussed a lot, clearly you add new content to Classic and THEN do BC. Because the Classic team is small. So once they move on to rebuilding TBC, Classic isn't getting touched.
---
That guy is really annoying with the constant bitching and complaining.
---
Lots of people are in this thread giving the outsiders opinion. 
---
Let me set you straight OP. I mained a NE Druid in vanilla. I was rank 12 in Pvp, did all the end game
---
PvE and had over 180 epics when BC was released.
---
Druids are great. The min max nay sayers here never played a Druid seriously back then. My PvE group ran 4 druids in our raid and some of us would be top heals in raids. (people will just say your priests and pallys sucked) we had all the content on farm and ran 3 different groups on all end game content. That’s 120 different raiders clearing Mc bwl and AQ40 weekly.
---
Druid is hard. You are a little gimped in certain aspects but overall utility is your strength. When pvping you have to use your cat, bear, heals and balance spells in every fight to be good.
---
You are very gear dependent as a feral Druid and it is very difficult to get great feral gear and that is the main drawn back for feral. 
---
Resto you will get geared fast and be fine. 
---
Balance was never exciting to me and I’ve only ever seen good balance Druids in videos made now on private servers so not sure if people just didn’t know how to play balance then or what but I never saw good one in my day.
---
Hope this helped.
---
But it will 😈
---
Yea, it must have broke overnight, now that i know others are experiencing it and it's not just something on my side ill submit a bug report.  Hoping others are doing the same if they're noticing it as well.
---
Are you a troll hunter? or a different race?
---
Fair enough, I judged too harshly and quickly for which I am sorry. I still beleive that some of your replies seemed trolly to me even if that might not have been your intention. Nostalgia is a huge factor and a lot of us will be dissatisfied/disappointed simply because the game won't be able to captivate us as it had in the past. I still believe that the game will be a lot more community driven but that has nothing to do with making the game harder or easier, just funner.
---
I still think that you're better off not trying to remind people of that or teach them or whatever. Most won't listen and are going to be adamantly driven to protecting their precious memories. As for the questing, it really depends how you quest and how you play the game. If you're doing a quick run of the game and your sole objective is to get first in everything thn ya you'll optimise and strategize how to make things easier for you. As for retail wow the game already has a mechanic that makes it easy for you to level up solo. Classic it is a bit harder.
---
I was not trying to seem like I was jumping in on the bashing fun but rather going with a reaction to what you were saying.
---
Payo, Monkey News (mn) or Stormx
---
Good luck in your quest and hopes. If you think blizzard will ban anyone for being a jerk from time to time, you are in for a bad time.

Will Classic run on my particular potato?
---
I re-downloaded WoW after like 10 years and have been playing the free stuff, but it says my graphics driver is out of date.  I'm on a laptop with a Intel HD 620 graphics card and as far as I know the driver is up to date (I downloaded one from the intel website earlier this week), but I'm still getting the error message.  Can anybody help (or direct me to a more appropriate forum if necessary)?  
---
Oh damn guess i can't like him anymore
---
Not really, the OSRS team doesn't slowly add retail Runescape updates, they have their own development team that creates entirely new quests and things. like an alternate timeline
---
Iirc they wanted torches to be a thing for the first type of night
---
YOU NO TAKE CANDLE
---
Dude really used a "really sticky glue" on one of the sons of flame in the kill video. GG
---
It is the absolute best time.
---
Classic raids are so easy compared to retail raids. If you can do Heroic raids on retail, you can do all the raids in Classic. Especially since everyone will have DBM and so many fights are so basic anyways.
---
Heroic Kil'Jaeden from Legion was harder than anything Classic can offer in a raid fight. God that was awful.
---
Play what ever race you want. Classic content doesnt need the crazy min maxing the vocal community thinks it does. Like the other guy said picking human just for raids should purely be for world firsts.
---
I treat the beta as a little of both. I’m playing an assload because I want to play wow classic, not because I’m super motivated to find bugs in particular. However, in playing an ass ton I am encountering a bunch of bugs, which is exactly what beta is for. 
---
Am I intentionally going around trying specific combinations of things to see if they’re screwy? No, I’m going around playing and reporting anything that I happen to encounter that seems wonky. 
---
As a side note: addons are becoming more popular on the beta, and as much as I *want* to use them, I don’t. Because I’ve been privileged to play the beta by blizzard, and as such I do feel an obligation to find bugs in the beta itself for blizzard, rather than things that might arise from addons bugging out. In the words of lord farquad: “it may cost some of *you* your lives, but that is a sacrifice that *I* am willing to make.”
---
&gt; If you think blizzard will ban anyone for being a jerk from time to time 
---
Jesus Christ dude I never said or implied this. If you want to argue a point don't make up things...
---
Beta is 1.13.2 already....
---
It would be  a great immersion but unplayable lol
---
Which would have been totally awesome but I also get why it didn't last. 
---
I really wish they would have taken some of these less-popular ideas and put them in a zone somewhere, y'know? Duskwood would have been the perfect "oh fuck it's dark" zone that required a torch buff you get from campfires.
---
O great. This comment again.
---
2.01 then.
---
 1.12.2 was still vanilla :)
---
Wait seriously? They're said they're doing layering in classic? Arghhh that's lame AF.
---
oh you were refering to detect traps by swirly ball, ye you're right lol :D
---
100% yes. Its what makes the game amazing
---
Print the shit out of it!
---
ROFL I just noticed that
---
Yes, you will be using primarily shadow bolt and possibly applying curses. However, unlike retail, you will also be managing your threat (an early shadow bolt crit can easily spell your death) and managing your mana by life tapping at opportune times so as to not over-stress healers or die to raid damage. These factors make it a lot more interesting than just 'spamming shadow bolt.' On top of this, there is room for some pet micro on a lot of fights. Go for it! Warlock is one of the more enjoyable dps in raids imo.
---
Because people (including me) have that perfect world that keeps growing in their heads, but are too blinded to even discuss the potential holes and how to avoid them.
---
"OMG JUST KEEP VANILLA PHILOSOPHY". It Just Works.
---
I'm always under the impression that you should play what sounds the most fun.
---
That being said, I'll tell you that warriors and shaman struggle while leveling, while warlocks and hunters level the easiest/quickest (mostly due to having a pet) 
---
If you plan on raiding or pvping, that's when it comes to just learning your class and role in each of the scenarios. 
---
Warriors = by far the best tanks, one of the highest dps, Slowest leveler. if you are a tank, you'll find groups so easy. Everyone wants a tank. 
---
Warlock = Good utility for raids but not too strong dps till late stages. Fast leveler. Great for pvp and will typically have a spot in raids. 
---
Shaman = (not much exp with these) You'll be anothe healer if you want to raid, ele and enhance aren't that good (someone can correct me, I was ally lol) and they are not that great of levelers. 
---
Rogue = Amazing DPS, good in both pvp and pve. Okay levelers (stealth is great). Harder to find groups and spots in raids due to high amount of rogues/dps around.
---
Priest = One of, if not the best healers in the game. Great in both PVP and PVE. Great levelers, however you'll be stuck healing because shadow sucks at cap. Easy to find groups.
---
Paladin = Up there with priest when it comes to healing, imo, better than priest in PvP. Slow, boring levelers (be ready to binge some netflix while leveling). At cap, prot is laughable spec, ret is.. not good (You may find a group who will bring you but it's not a big spec to take). Holy is the most viable spec but you'll be a heal/buff bot.
---
Hunter = Amazing levelers, probably the easiest (either them or warlocks). They have a low skill floor but a high ceiling. A lot of people didn't learn them correctly which spawned the term "huntard". They do good dps to start but slowly fade as the progression happens.
---
Mage = Great levelers, Great DPS, bring good utility, have food/water they can give, portals, good for pvp and pve. PvE you will basically be spamming frostbolt so it's not a hard class for raiding to start at least, once you get into higher raids I think it's possible to go fire for a different playstyle. 
---
Druids = Meh DPS, okay tanks (mostly only tank5 mans and occasional things in raids), good healers. They can shapeshift, which is fun. Honestly I don't have much to say about these guys it's another heal bot but not as good as some the others and doesn't have an out of combat rez (but DOES have a 30min CD in combat rez). Usually brought along for innervate and the battle rez.
---
I think he actually wants them to roll alliance. Can’t figure out why though...
---
The capacity for someone else to arbitrarily decide that I don't get to have fun today is why I refuse to roll on a pvp server.   I play games to relax, not to scream in anguish because the two hours I get that day to escape from reality is being stolen by a dorito and redbull scented sociopath named "Lolikillzu" who has decided that no one gets to use Stonetalon Mountains that day.
---
I could swear they re-introduced dark nights as well as weather effects one expac.. maybe Legion.  What happened to that?
---
If I go forsaken I'm trying to get  a 3man together for launch to camp the inside of the cave for xp!
---
**Frostadamus** and **Madseasonshow** are both pretty chill and just straight up nice people. The take the game a little slower, but have interesting insights into the game ... also: check out their youtube channels, they have really great videos!
---
I can also recommend **Perplexity**, he is a very good rogue player. In beta he is farming form engi with his guildmates, does world PvP, duels and BGs atm. occasionally he also tries out certain things that might be bugged.

I've never been much of a PvP guy aside from a few premades when I'm super bored. I've only ever played alliance because the races, zones, and major cities are so much cooler in my opinion. Max level locks are definitely rarer on alliance so they always have a solid niche to fill in raid groups and have a tight knit corps in whatever guild theyre in.
---
My first to 60 in vanilla was a warrior and it shall be once more.
---
**Guild Name:** Quidi Vidi Society

**Region:** US

**Faciton:** To be Determined

You have to scroll past it though... Multiple times a day. If people searched before they made a post it'd help reduce spam a lot.
---
We don’t need to be understood our power levels are over 9000
---
Thanks for your opinion on homophobia, /u/trannykiller
---
Then why did you even bother to reply to my second post? I pretty much said that anything but extreme cases won't get people banned.
---
And people that are too sensitive should either grow a thicker skin or go home. That's the internet, that's how it is and how it always will be.
---
Landro was added in patch 2.0.1. Yes, technically Vanilla since players couldn't enter the Dark Portal for another 6 weeks, but that also means LFG was technically Vanilla.
---
The first TCG set, Heroes of Azeroth, wasn't even released until 3 months *after* the patch we're playing.
---
Landro and his items will not be making an appearance in WoW Classic and thus the Riding Turtle should be removed from OP's list.
---
Yeah, I would say his voice comes off as informative. Prefer that at times over someone that is hyperactive and/or trying hard to be funny
---
&gt;than use them complete faulty
---
Classic is already running off of 1.13 so I guess we're done here
---
LFG was officially added by Blizzard *before* The Dark Portal opened. It is canon for WoW Classic!
---
So I just need to start paying again right ? No need to actively play on retail ?
---
I wish I can wipe out my memory of wow and have classic be my first experience.
---
That second image looks like ass
---
Yeah I changed my mind. I’m going to be the worlds greatest stream sniper.
---
Yeah, I can blame them for blatant misinformation.
---
Well I have some bad news for you
---
Here's some screenshots from ***pre-launch:***

---
I wish I would have the same opportunity as you. Jumping into the game was awe inspiring back in its day...
---
Was. Not is. Times have changed. Mmorpgs are more streamlined. Also, ultima was the first one most played. Just because its not you doesnt make it true. 
---
Draw backs of classic wow
---
-no quest arrows
---
-nothing is streamlined 
---
-mounts will cost an arm and leg.
---
-classic wow with microtransactions
---
-if you solo and arew new to mmos wow will be like a secons job
---
-its wow youll get over the nostalgia unless youre running mods

Depends.  Do you want to play the best game ever?

Hi, /u/godvyrgill
---
&gt; Are there books about the developers and behind the scenes of developing WoW?
---
"The WoW Diary" by John Staats, Blizzards first 3D Level Designer.
---
Newsflash, there's been more people playing WoW in Europe than in NA since 2005. Blizzard from a business standpoint has to have a relatively clean launch as to keep as many ppl interested as possible. So actually giving early prime-time release to US and midnight release to EU means less overall stress on the servers while still remaining something of a big turnout.
---
Like a noon release in EU on a Tuesday means that except the few people who took days off, there'll be nobody playing. Whereas midnight makes it so some will be tempted to play an hour or two before heading to bed coz they have to work later on in the day.
---
From a business standpoint their decision makes perfect sense.
---
Short answer: yes
---
Long answer: hell yes
---
I would say the most coveted key and best one to make gold with is UBRS not the scarlet key. I've never seen anyone paying for that.
---
tfw a wolf parries your attack
---
For this new iteration of vanilla I havent see any making of kind of book or documentary probably due to it still being in development but for beginning of it all john staats, who is one the first dungeon designers and made things like brd and karazahn, has a kickstarter for a book about how it all started. Here is the link https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whenitsready/the-world-of-warcraft-diary-0
---
Absolutely the best, right up there with Crendor.
---
I can't remember when this changed, but it might have been before 1.12? I remember being annoyed about it when it happened. It didn't just affect rogues -- it was any slow or snare. e.g. if you were snared from crippling poison or something, you would do a super slow run animation instead of a sort of fast tiptoeing. Maybe it wasn't realistic...but I did like it. If you can get this reverted to the original behavior that would be fantastic.
---
But practical? Probably not
---
We have no idea if they spawn the same way. A big part of being able to farm them so effectively was the fact the private servers had them spawning in a very predictable pattern so you could basically keep the entire zone permafarmed with 4-6 people, plus some extras in case of PvP. While pservers have the general game mechanics mostly correct, things like spawn timers/locations are largely guesswork and it's entirely possible that devilsaurs actually spawn in a manner that makes it impractical to try to permafarm them.
---
It's a shame Blizzard has to come in and nerf everything that's fun.
---
You can just look everything up on youtube. Frostadamus did a pretty good Job covering all the professions.
---
I was in pre-school
---
&gt; Then why did you even bother to reply to my second post? I pretty much said that anything but extreme cases won't get people banned.
---
Because you said people need thicker skins, which they don't. Blizzard needs to do their jobs and enforce the rules that they have applied. I also pointed out that this was relevant to pservers, you claimed that retail was the same and i gave you an example to which you then point out to be an extreme case on retail, which again it is not rare on a pserver...
---
&gt;And people that are too sensitive should either grow a thicker skin or go home 
---
You just down have the level of empathy that those have it seems, it makes more sense to block hate speech then oust the targets of said hate speech...
---
&gt;That's the internet, that's how it is and how it always will be 
---
Not how it is on this sub, or any site that bans hate speech like that.
---
yikes
---
Only if you're dual wielding
---
IF is the end game city. SW is always more populated with people leveling since humans are the most popular race and the Elwynn -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge -&gt; Duskwood -&gt; STV route is what most alliance players opt for.
---
Joana
---
Beta has nights quite bright, actually.
---
[Deftkin Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16659/deftkin-belt) is from a water globe quest.
---
Can be attained at 23(?) item drops off Tideress in Ashenvale (lvl 27). Warsong supplies is another quest in Ashenvale that has good rewards and is a “must” for any horde while leveling imo.
---
I've been trying to resist, but seeing all these streamers playing warrior has got me interested in trying it out.
---
I'm really suprised that the #nochanges mindset isn't carrying over to TBC and Wrath.
---
Eastern Kingdoms looks like weird baby elephant.
---
I personally would like a progression server, essentially release all the expansions after x amount of time up to Wotlk. Have it separate from the classic servers so people can keep playing classic. The only issue is they are not doing this from the gate so if they did do it, people would have to start over again. It would fragment the pop but it would be less of a fragment of having classic severs plus TBC server plus WoTLK servers etc etc.
---
Yeah about 10 times a day
---
I played pservers casually. I unfortunately agree that the meme specs are pretty disappointing. I was in denial too. :(
---
As others have said, you can't use other players abilities in the way your describing, but certain NPCs have some abilities you have access to that can be interesting or beneficial.
---
Impressive indeed. The problem really is the equipment. Getting pre Raid (almost) BiS for one spec is already hard. Besides this, the ability to truely play a hybrid which can do both is very tempting.
---
Yeah while 20 min BWL runs are efficient, they don't look fun.
---
Orjatar!
---
Still people should talk about BfA flaws, instead of saying how it's bad compared to a completely different game, shitposting won't help make a game better. I don't think that WoW in last 4-5 expansions can even be compared to vanilla/BC, it's just a different game for different audience
---
Purely subjective on your part to say world pvp became non existent. Someone getting away from a gank easily and quickly is no different than a person mounting on a 100% mount and running away, especially if the ganker only has a 60% one. Flying brought extra content to the game that many enjoyed and shouldn't be downplayed or negated because you wanted something different. Seems very subjective.
---
Holy reck!
---
Absolutely. I had in my mind I would make a handful of characters of varying classes and races, but I too had forgotten the vanilla experience enough that I thought this reasonable. The beta curved my expectations of myself tremendously and now I only have a couple characters I plan to work on. So instead I've been leveling the ones I dont actually plan to use in live in the beta, so I still scratch the itch.
---
If you enjoy roleplaying games, exploring a vast unforgiving world and meeting lots of players.
---
Then you couldnt start playing a better game than Classic.
---
If you enjoy easy to follow linear progression with clear goals and just want to "rush to the end so you can get the stuff", then no.
---
There are a couple of issues here.  
---
Like you said there is the matter of it being opinion and team comp based.  Some comps you might be expected to be the burst, another comp you might be expected to more like the sustained damage, another comp might expect you to flag carry or defend.
---
Another issue is most of the bis is the pvp gear itself, but the pvp gear was upgraded in the patch cycles.  Blizzard has said that items will be in there 1.12 status, unless the items were added later to the game.  For the pvp sets the entire sets were replaced, not just upgraded, but if they leave pvp items in their early state while buffing pve items they run the risk of creating a phase in the game where blue pve items are better then blue pvp items for pvp.  
---
Example early warrior pvp set: https://vanillawowdb.com/?itemset=281
---
Later pvp set:  https://vanillawowdb.com/?itemset=537
---
Last you have to ask yourself how much pve gear to include.  The absolute best stuff available will be ony or MC drops in phase 1, but often harder to get to then the pvp gear.  
---
The goal of a early pvp bis list would be 5% hit, as much HP as is possible, the slowest 2h possible, and then fill out with str and crit.  
---
[This is my best guess.](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12fca6e80be4965f706a27dd61c61ed2fd004e0879979e4d228bae59460b56c95f1a7ecf2a864f68afe803167296745587ef643e61c77a4c97db7bbe6c2fd119b28486185814b0e627f9246760d603bebf52c99fa1e56957e9620a1821c76099a591bc10c5641e349fa6fd3d33cd1209ce78158b17b89f6020fb642e5f7a7d66a048f2575e01041252b0ec443899274e70e68bedfe8faa8c0282d8ee41ac1d62e278eb0aa14c8a8bb426ba5a3b9637d028d)  
---
This would be no-raiding, no post 1.4 gear, dungeons+DM gear only.  Lionheart is boe crafted, is recommended for every warrior.  Arcanite reaper is as well, is more replaceable then lionheart if you can only afford one of the two.
---
nihilium also had to design and learn bosses, compared to us knowing the fights inside and out and having an idea for strats. Plus being able to setup having enough warriors ready for 4H with ZG spell hit on use trinket
---
What's your price and would you ship to austria?
---
I’ve actually done that and yeah, it’s a lot better
---
Still don't know if they'll make it that dark though
---
&gt; I think the outside world having less relevant gear in TBC had a more significant impact on world pvp. The TBC pvp zones were massive failures and never provided enough incentive or the engaging gameplay to get players involved.
---
What the hell are you talking about? Halaa and the Spirit Towers were always active PvP spots on my server; Isle of QD as well when that was released. "Outside world having less relevant gear" lmao people were outside all the time grinding rep, farming primals, and later doing dailies. If anything raidlogging was probably more common in Vanilla, especially since 99% of raiders didn't give a shit about consumables or buffs. 
---
I can never tell if people on this board are being intentionally dense, outright lying, or just misremembering. But the mental gymnastics people go through to shit on every expansion is just absurd. Like cmon, "Less engaging gameplay" what the fuck does that even mean?
---
Confirmed!  Mana issues but very strong and critical strike like a mofo. Get good at kiting and enjoy the burst!
---
Great example of the crazy amounts of skill required for ret. As a squishy horde mage it does make me nervous though. I forgot how powerful BoFs are when you can't just spellsteal them.
---
yea i keep going back and forth on horde vs alliance. I was Alliance back in the day during vanilla but now I am horde on retail with most of my buddies. Do I go back to alliance or stay horde ....
---
First of all 95% of the dorks constantly calling everything autistic probably don't even know what autism is. In general what I've seen in the chat and stuff like that is that people just love repeating other things people say.
---
There were a handful of people that were openly gay back in vanilla and it didn't seem to really be a problem, in my view some of them were very geared players that had a great time and a place in the community. Sure people repeat dumb comments all the time and surely will anytime anywhere online.
---
As far as the bfa stuff goes that's mostly just this sub classic is going to have a mix of people returning people from pservers and retail players. 
---
Lots of people out there just want attention and they're willing to go after negative attention, so they say things that are offensive. Who honestly knows if they actually believe those things or not it's probably best to report them or ignore them and just move on.
---
Short Answer: Yes
---
Long Answer: Absolutely! Read the quests, learn the story, get in groups and go out and quest and explore. It's a very good game
---
Staysafe playing warlock makes me want to play it less but then I see snutz and can't resist.
---
I need this in my life
---
I'd love it too to be opposing faction of a streamer. Just watch his stream on my second screen and see me rape him over and over again through his eyes (-:
---
Bro, NoBro, WhoaBro, Ohbro, ChocoBro, SoBro. All mine, no takes bro.
---
That site doesn't make money out of those people. And i have empathy, i don't participate in insults but i also don't get affected AT ALL. I mean, my mind simply cannot comprehend being affected by some moron on a site or a game that insults me. I get it, people are different but there is nothing you can do.
---
Every single game with online community is a toxic cesspool. LoL,DoTA, BFA, Overwatch (esp that one), i can go forever. This will never EVER change, and it will only work in people's interest to either addapt or quit. 
---
That's how it works.
---
Tried to do redridge escort quest, glitched first 2 times, 3rd time horde kills the npc and i fail the quest. 1.5 hours spent and nothing achieved. is this the fun challenge everyone is talking about
---
Ele is one of those specs where you can't really shine when you're good though. Literally takes no effort to stomp people into the ground.
---
This is so true aside from WOD this was the fastest I logged on maybe once a week for my cache or raid. Even then anything I got wasn't satisfying at all even if it was BiS. I cant wait to go back to the days of if you got an epic it feels epic.
---
It is not about generating the heat due to high resource consumption, but blocking the air streams which lead to overheating.
---
That's one of the reasons I'm rolling femgnome warlock.
---
(and their racials are pretty damn good)
---
Has there ever been an MMORPG beta in the history of gaming where there wasn't a wipe after beta? I'm kinda curious why people keep asking this question.
---
Esfand is awesome. Super cool personality, plays a shitty class but knows it's bad and memes about it, but plays it at a fairly good level.
---
I also like Venruki. He's really chill and an incredible mage. Used to always watch him for his monk gameplay.
---
There is a strong correlation (and arguably causation) that practice does in fact quite literally make you better! Imagine that....
---
Sure, because your wild ass speculation is much better than mine.
---
Get Tailoring and a gathering prof (I like Herb a lot), you need Tailoring for Robes of the Voide, after that drop it for Eng or Alchemy depending on your gathering prof
---
It was a joke.
---
It has a good side as well, lesser population at start. :)
---
10-12 got two characters to max and did some MC lmao.  A lot of people yall played with were kids and you just didnt know it.
---
Almost everyone on this sub were in your position 15 years ago, and here we are still itching to play it again.
---
Play a pvp server for the full experience.
---
Fresh servers, with the same timely-content release? Why is this option always missing from these polls?
---
Are you saying the internet lied to me?
---
I agree. At that point though they would have to have a way to move players into those new realms. Offering free realm transfers might get a good chunk of the players into the new realm but what incentive would people have to move?
---
Holy crap, that inky potion night looks NICE! Why don't they just give us an option to toggle that?! I would pay an extra $5 a month for that.
---
the best part about this is if that happens, you can get some guildies to come get them, then they can get some guildies, and suddenly you have an all out world pvp raid because of one dude campin another dude
---
Ofc they play an allied race
---
Thats what I was saying, bfa and Classic are so different they can't really be compared to each other but you can compare bfa to legion. As you said, it's a different audience and I personally didn't like legion as I prefer real mmorpgs like classic but it was still objectively a good expansion and I can't deny that.
---
But bfa just sucks, it's basically scam.
---
At this point it's just more fun to shittalk bfa than actually playing it (for me that is)
---
This is very true, I'm just concerned with leveling qol and being able to snag raid slots conveniently.
---
I have not played any private servers and retired right after tbc. And I don't recall there being any shortcuts out of an instance by loging out, only by dying or such. Also, the 5 instances an hour was a thing, ran into it farming some mining nodes.
---
Bruh im leveling one if each class and then the same on horde
---
He may always say PvP is more challenging, everybody likes challenges. Oh wait.
---
That's right but it won't guarantee you a beta invite so be prepared for that. You might just be paying 3 months for nothing.
---
&gt;i also don't get affected AT ALL. I mean, my mind simply cannot comprehend being affected by some moron on a site or a game that insults me. I get it, people are different but there is nothing you can do.
---
Doesn't sound like empathy to me.... Also you have it towards other people being targeted by these slurs/threats, not yourself. 
---
&gt; This will never EVER change 
---
Only because people like you who don't care to try and make it change and just support the hate with silence.
---
Start farming/saving money at lvl 30, you can get a lot of money with gathering profs (skinning and cooking are basically free money), believe it or not, even at fresh servers tehre is a lot of AH action
---
Also there was no resetting them while inside
---
Because everyone lived happily ever after...it's not like people disagree on things, or allot of people want "true" vanilla OSRS.
---
Also since it worked for OSRS, it will obviously work for WoW.
---
"Just follow the classic philosophy" It Just Works.
---
only for the first phase thankfully, so when they add incentives to pvp, it should be gone
---
They're good, just hard to gear, so when other classes get geared they scale much better.
---
Just through phase 1. Then they are turning it off. It's for the initial rush. Once the servers calm down, it's gone
---
The past three expansions have done it right... Force you to land mount for a large beginning of the expansion and then earn flying to make it easier.
---
lol why is that
---
Yes, arenas. 99% of teams made from Holy paladins and Warriors. Sounds fun.
---
Propably prepatch before tbc launch
---
A friend said that it will be possible to build groups cross-sever via battle.net. Is this true? I couldn't find anything on it.
---
Aye, I was going to roll Orc Warrior, but after seeing the Undead intro once again I'll be fighting for The Forsaken!
---
It gives the game giant exposure. I swear all this bitching of streamers is so over the top . Azmon had what 80k viewers? It doesnt matter if they havent played, theyre bring a lot of people in. Its good for the community
---
Mages are not much better in rotation. It’s just frostbolt-frostbolt-frostbolt. But that’s how it was in raids during vanilla , all rotations were simple
---
I recall taming a named beast in tbc for a hunter twink, so should be true.
---
TBC is the goat, but I think they should do what Mark Kern said, go an alternate reality route; it makes the future of Classic wow endless with new expansions but keep the core structure of classic/TBC there.
---
I'd pay to hear a word for word remake of the onyxia wipe animation by madseasonshow
---
My memory is faulty since the time, just wanted to get a refresh on all the possibilities from each profession, and how they could either benefit my character or be a potential money maker/sink
---
Asmongold or Swifty
---
Added this to ["Will it Classic"](https://willitclassic.com/view/FqwDs4b1G1p0ZWQjPlXG). This should up the visibility a bit. If you get it up on Curse, I'll update the links.
---
In that case they changed it back. In WotLK, they made nights bright.
---
&gt;And if i learnt something in 15 years of WoW, it's that listening to the community is bad idea.
---
Which implies they're currently repeating their mistakes, as they are listening to the #NoChanges community. 
---
Food for thought. And probably downvotes.
---
I totally understand how you feel. I'm a Horde player since vanilla but technically my first character was a Night Elf and I got that character to like 52 or something. I really love different things about both factions and sometimes I just want to go visit Ironforge or Stormwind. Granted I did that sometimes because I played a Rogue and could stealth but it's not the same having to hide in corners. 
---
I'll be going Horde as usual, but I understand the urge to see both sides of the world equally!
---
Hi, /u/Ainslynn
---
I've been leveling a warrior on the Beta (first time out of my vanilla experience on private servers) and I feel like this everytime it happens
---
Is it because of wotf?
---
Aren't priests like 90% of healing slots anyway? Sprinkle a few druids and a holy paladin (who is there for some reason).
---
Irc the l last quest only becomes availble around 20 or so, so probably best to wait for it.
---
From the nelf above the entrance.
---
I'd actually argue that the poly was an okay strategic play. If you know you can't win, then at least make the enemy blow their resources so they can't use them against the flag carrier. 
---
Although clearly neither player was actually playing to win the BG so 🤷‍♂️
---
Sure mate, when someone cries for being insulted i will cry with them. Is that your definition of empathy or what? 
---
And i knew that was coming btw, being able to shrug off attacks on the iternet makes be a bad person.
---
Good luck in your endeavor of changing the world. All i said is that some things wont change but it seems if i stand by my opinion, soon you will put me on equal grounds with Satan himself.
---
I can guarantee all you're doing is making it easier for Blizzard to figure out how to block LFG addons from ever being made in the future once your addon is swiftly broken and rendered useless
---
Thanks for being a great beta tester ;)
---
Kargoz on YouTube does a bunch of guides and he has a google docs link in the description for every video that will take you to the resource he’s using in said video. Really useful and in depth stuff!
---
would rather they add new content while staying true to the core values of classic.    
---
but tbc is my favorite xpac so I also want that
---
There's a pretty fundamental difference between someone leaving on a ground mount (let's forgo the fact that majority didn't even have 100%), because you can run into other people who will attack him and you can easily pursue. Not so much with flying mounts.
---
^ This on so many levels. I mean c'mon people they gave people a boat that doesnt float on water if they sub for 6 months.
---
Yes and no. Its called "the industry holiday" and most industries close at the same time in July/August. Its always a bit of a hassle for hospitals etc that cant close. Most stuff open for private customers will be open while professional shops for companies and industries are closed.
---
It wont take long for people to find out the spawn timer and locations even if pservers are wrong.
---
Im going druid and building a bear tank. And there's nothing anyone can do to stop me.
---
Doubtful, we're only using function calls that the "must-have" addons use. To break us means breaking pretty much everything.
---
Yup.. I originally played Rogue in Vanilla. At first, I wanted to go Enh Shaman, because that's what I've been since Cata Onward. Having tried enhancement, it's seriously lack luster. It's like a weaker warrior with no gap closer in PvP, and basically just a much weaker warrior in pve.
---
My next thought was Feral that I played as my PvP main since wotlk, but that quickly fell through too. The 1v1 is solid, love the skill cap. However, for some reason 1vX feels awful, worse than any other class. It might be the capitalization on your form swaps when there's multiple people, but either way it feels nearly impossible for some reason.
---
After that I tried Lock, and I'm still on the fence, but most likely going Lock. I considered going Rogue again because I'm more of a Melee player tbh, but there's just going to be so many rogues that it would kinda bother me. 
---
So, I guess it's down to Lock vs Rogue for now lol
---
Not during all of vanilla IIRC.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Yeah but it could be five times longer than on pservers for all we know.
---
It will be very different from any modern mmo. I mean, the main reason I started wow classic is because when I was 11 it was the first time I logged into wow and I got sucked in. 
---
And here I am , 14 years later, BOY - GIMME CLASSIC. I am not sure you will have the same experience. BUT the launch experience in itself will be a grand adventure. And originally wow classic was made for the casual player where especially the leveling journey is the best thing to experience. If you can look over the people telling you "get gud" , then you will have an absolut fantastic experience. Although, keep in mind, it is very very very different. You will die. A lot. You will feel absolutely helpless, lost and running from a to b without any clue whether that's the right spot or not. Trust me, getting punched in the balls isn't fun . Getting punched by your girlfriend and then getting her finger up your... wait. Im drifting apart. You will love it. lol
---
Let me know when you have something. In building a personal guide as well
---
I havent played that game, and I dont plan on either.. but it seems nearly every RPG nowadays has this weird system of having "regular" levels first and then a secondary level system after you hit "max" level, usually I think this is done to create the illusion of endless content/character progression. To a degree I guess it creates endless progression, but honestly every game ive seen this system, the progression is always shallow and borderline meaningless.   
---
Seriously developers, there is nothing wrong with having an end. Let us set a goal and be happy when we get there, thanks.
---
No just the actual definition
---
Doubt it
---
Don’t understand why you’re being downvoted man 😂
---
Tipsoutbaby
---
I also remember Palar now that you mention the name! This is the kind of stuff I'm talking about. Thanks for mentioning that. I was in Sleepless Knights myself, I believe we ran a few raids and BG's with some of your members when we needed to fill. Hopefully there will be a few server posts closer to launch for people to reunite.
---
Surprisingly enough I think it will be less daunting then trying to start in current wow. It’s an amazing experience and I’m sure you’ll be able to survive and thrive in it
---
Absolutely! My older brother is in your position, and I’m going to enjoy the crap out of playing with him come launch. He’s super excited to see what I was talking about ten years ago.
---
It has a lot of utility in a raid.
---
Don't play the victim now...
---
Also when i hear "Classic Vanilla, the game as it once was" i don't expect changes. Pretty weak attempt on your part i must say.
---
If it was called "WoW 2, that would follow the classic design path" then i wouldn't defend the no changes crowd.
---
Asmongold is only good streamer for wow :)
---
&amp;Company is ok too
---
I loved TBC, but ugh, the flying mounts with 280% speed just made PvP servers irrelevant.
---
Ideally it's only on 1 server but we'll see :)
---
This is how you spot bullshit. When somebody tells you, that you can make 2-3m by playing/leveling and "enduring" bfa. If this was true, nobody would be paying for a subscription nowdays. I'm sure Blizz would be totaly into that.
---
If you want to make that Kind of money in wow, you have to learn to play the auction House. It was always like that.
---
You have to know the current economy. And compete against other people that are doing the same. It's not as easy to get in as everyone tells you. And most of them aren't doing it themselves for a reason.
---
Asmongold is so toxic, though. I get why he has fans, but I'd go mad if he was a fellow guildie or raid leader.
---
I found https://twitch.tv/sequisha the other day when Shroud hosted him. Really enjoy his stream. Good dude, mature, fun and calm.
---
Im thinking about going hunter instead off warrior, duo to the better dps then leveling. Hunters dont have glancing blows like warriors and mages do, and do not get resisted like mages do. 
---
My leveling group already have a warrior and a priest/paladin.
---
I’m stuck between Shaman and Hunter. I’m sure I’ll end up leveling both but I’m not sure who I want at end game first. Probably Hunter for Rok’delar and world pvp
---
No, but you’re also playing a beta, you should report the bug so it is not present in live.
---
Nope. Elf is iconic as a rogue.
---
D&amp;D is only as casual as your DM makes it.
---
I was thinking about playing a hunter for the first time. My question is about profession. I plan on leveling with mining / skinning and at 60, drop skinning for engineering primarily for the thorium shells.
---
But i can't find any information that would confirm that they are in the classic version we're gonna get. Can someone confirm this?
---
Should be
---
&gt;If you aren't the main clothing in your guild, It's a useless craft at 300 since you wont get the fantastic recipes
---
Untrue. You can have the main tailor craft you the BoE bloodvine set. Just need 300 tailoring yourself for the set bonus.
---
Even so that would make them rarer and worth more, making it harder for smaller groups to get them vs guilds
---
Overkill is underrated
---
Quests like these have always been glitchy. Are they fixing those? I thought people would cry about no changes
---
Progressions as PVE priest? Thinking Herb/alch
---
This guy is right
---
Which is? I told you, i don't participate in forum/game toxic dramas. I don't like these people, i simply ignore them. So what do you expect me to do?
---
I told the OP in my other post in this thread, just find others with a similar mind set and ignore the morons.
---
Watching the streamers have kind of cemented my decision to play Alliance. I forgot how depressing and brown the Horde areas are.
---
Plus every streamer I like is Alliance.
---
We spent so much time building frost resist gear, never got to that boss, and never once thought to put it on for a frost mage duel. I wish I had an answer to your question. I'd like to know. Ultimately, power will best defense, but I'd bet there is a magical breakpoint where you can make it work.
---
I am in the beta and this is what it looks like for me.
---
I am so jealous of you!
---
I know this that's why I said even, as in its unlikely.
---
No idea why I got downvotes tbh.
---
Mage vs Ret at level 30 is pretty rough on a mage if the pally is somewhat coherent
---
I mained a feral Druid in vanilla. I mted all of ZG, AQ 20, all of Mc minus Rag and most of bwl. The fights were easier with me druid tanning because my health pool and maxed out armor made me less squishy then our full tier 2 prot warrior.
---
Can you teleport back to the start of a dungeon by typing /camp or logging out
---
and if so why is there no outrage of hunters and mages demanding to know more.
---
Your not getting a key. Just give up.
---
Sorry, and thank you for the clarification.

---
Thanks, that did help yes
---
No problem
---
What are you talking about? This guy is such a noob. I’ve watched him click abilities he has bound to keys 1-3.
---
I led a semi-hardcore raid back in 1.12. We we're halfway through Naxx, and it took us a full raid to do BWL and half of AQ40.
---
World buffs are a uniquely pserver thing.
---
Alliance performs better in pve. Their races/classes are more suited to PvP. 
---
Typically on Vanilla servers (was as true in retail as pservers) alliance players don’t queue as often as horde. Leading to a situation where horde have 30 min queues and alliance insta. The down side being, with 30 min queues the horde premades and rolls with consumables.
---
I have no data, but I’ve got a hunch Horde will be the more popular faction this time around (not by much, but when looking at the total vanilla population, I’ll bet more horde). That is good for alliance players, enough people will play you’ll not feel on a dead faction for pve. And the disparity of population makes wpvp more fun and instant bg queues. 
---
I’ve got a soft spot for horde, but 1-30 as human/dwarf/gnome crossing between Westfall, loch Modan, red ridge, wetlands, duskwood is the best start to the game. Like orgrimmar all you want, IF is a more convenient city for 80% of classic endgame content.
---
just wanted to second the opinion of going feral even if you will heal your buddies. Most of the resto tree isnt THAT game changing for healing early on, and feral gives you a huge leg up in leveling
---
Don’t sweat it. I’m looking forward to playing Classic when it launches regardless of everything. I’m super excited to see how it maybe draws in new players too. No new MMORPGs come out anymore that are even half decent. New players could actually enjoy the same game that drew so many of us in. My wife only plays today, despite starting a couple years ago, because I helped her stay involved. By herself when she started, there was just way too much to do. It was overwhelming and it made her want to stop playing right away.
---
He's funny :)

Don't be a pussy. Cmon m8 :/
---
Esfand and madseason are the only two I watch personally. I dont really like any of the rest of them.
---
Wait wait. Are you telling me we don't have to use the old script and the TBC "/cast [target=mouseover] spell" will work? Big of true. Do we also know if startattack works?
---
&gt; I envy you
---
Yes and no.
---
Playing this game back in 04/05/06 for the first time is still an experience that will never be matched in gaming for me. The internet as we know it now barely existed back then, which meant you could completely immerse yourself in the world and get lost in it, no one telling you where to go or what to do, you made your own path, it was all very spontaneous and natural, pretty much no outside influences.
---
The memories of fire balling my first wolves in the human starting area are still ingrained in my brain, I can still remember the sheer sense of wonder I felt, realizing how insanely huge the world was, and not even being able to measure just how much I had ahead of me. I really wish an experience like this was possible, but I don't believe it is unless you put severe restrictions on yourself.
---
Layer? I've hardly even met 'er!
---
Thank you for your answers. Seems like it will be enchanting/tailoring, then.
---
Gonna make a Alchemy/Herb toon for moneys and flasks.
---
It's possible yeah. But probably won't be any guilds planning to do it without, just because it's really hard to check your raidmembers.
---
Yep. I've done a comparison myself, retail night in Redridge is currently *darker* than in classic. 
---
That said they changed the light color in a whole bunch of zones. So some are darker, some are lighter, and some just look like an entirely different zone all-together. There's also a very distinct shimmering effect in classic which, to my knowledge, is gone in retail. It really gives the sense of a moonlit night.
---
Sorry - we require image posts to be explanatory based on the image itself, not based only on the title. Without the title, the post is just a generic cropped screenshot.
---
Is Whirlwind Axe still the better reward over the Whirlwind Warhammer if you're human with the racial +5 to maces? The axe is only a 0.2 difference in attack speed slower, and even has *slightly* less DPS than the hammer. I was planning on going Fury early on too since I'd probably out-pace the whirlwind weapons by the time I could get Mortal Strike anyway , so I'd have 5% generic crit instead of the 5% crit with axes from the Arms tree.
---
He honestly not. He’s cringy and toxic.
---
But the snoooow zones
---
He's speaking specifically to people playing the beta for the level 30 meta, just to be clear.
---
You’re intentionally limiting yourself by doing this so I doubt it. Unless some of the vocal minority on here that want no addons band together and form a guild.
---
He is super funny, best streamer for WoW imo :)
---
Dodge by a turtle.
---
I took 30 days /played to get to 60 when the game came out.  I think I spent a week mining copper in the starting zone.  I got myself together later and beame a rather accomplished player, but I never once regretted how long it took me to level.  I really enjoyed it.
---
Check out Joana for some straight up amazing bugchecking and gameplay.
---
If they go horde. They can’t be your fiends anymore.
---
After seeing your post history I legitimately feel bad for you sorry. But it only strengthens my point you have no life or confidence.
---
 In TBC I had a fully T5 geared destro warlock, casted soul fire on a boar outside of orgrimmar and it resisted. Had to delete me account
---
Thanks! I’ll definitely consider this. I wouldn’t have to fight for leather loot in my group either so I could collect feral gear for levelling as well. I love all the possibilities with Druid
---
Flying mounts in azeroth super nerfed gathering professions
---
Alliance did. The human lands of Elwynn, Westfall, red ridge and duskwood were 8-9 months of iteration and were supposed to be a microcosm test case for what all quest and zone structures were to be. You’ll notice the defies quest takes you through all those zones. Horde nor any other races has a chain quite like that.
---
Blizzard realized making the entire game to that quality would mean it’d never ship. So while the entire game is great (and there are epic multi zone quests all throughout the leveling experience) the human lands are by far the most polished.
---
Fury warriors were only top tier dps in the latter part of vanilla though. Not sure if that was because of gear scaling or class patch so it might be true for classic. 
---
However, tanks were severely threat capped in MC and especially BWL so being able to do the best dps mattered very little since you'd pull aggro if you went all out. That's why rogues were by all means the best dps in the early days, and hunters if you by some miracle had a capable ones since they were the only ones who could reset their threat.
---
On a lot of fights you'd also be required to offtank as a dps warrior for parts of the fights.
---
Mage raiding in MC and BWL wasn't much better though. Decursing was tiresome, dieing on every aoe pack and alternating wanding and frostbolt because of threat limitations. Things became much more interesting in AQ and Naxx when fire was the main raiding spec and we didn't have to be on decurse duty every 2 fights. 
---
As for pvp being a mage was probably more convenient if you wanted to raid and pvp. While their pvp and pve specs might have taken a few different talents you'd be very capable in both pvp and pve early on with a standard frost spec and late vanilla with a fire spec without having to respec every day. 
---
In 1v1 frost had more outplay potential but quite a few hard counters like Warlocks and basically every class that was able to heal itself because they would outlast you. As Fire you wouldn't automatically win against all the melee classes but you'd be able to burst down everyone with the right gear and some lucky crits.
---
Only the stress test requires an active subscription. I got beta access, and my subscription is not active
---
Alliance. Only morons and bad players go horde.
---
Cant go wrong with herb alch
---
Reroll to alliance.
---
I like these ideas.
---
Maybe if you take a certain amount of damage while in a flying mount, you get dismounted and plummet. That way flying is dangerous, ranged DPS can take you down so there's still player interaction. Combine it with what you suggested about flying too high (out of range) costs your mount too much stamina so you have to fly lower.
---
Yea this. You dont need to spec protection to tank leveling dungeons. Just keep a 1h and shield with you
---
Webster’s, and this is classic we only have like 50 total ignores! You can report them real quick, I’m really not talking about normal cursing or politics, but the horrible racism/homophobic attacks/bigotry.
---
Here’s a personal example 
---
My best friend is black I’m white, when playing on a pserver, I can really tell when something like that affects him. People are trying to play a game to have fun, not be pulled out of it suddenly by people yelling slurs and hurling real life insults. Idk why we have to be so tolerant of it and be called thin skinned when fighting against it
---
I was 8 I played a nelf hunter and did not known what I was doing in the slightest. I remember there was a few times where I did not know how to repair gear or even find my body when I died. Clearly knew what I was doing.
---
agreed, something worth noting and not a difficult thing to fix. can put a lackey on this and have it fixed within a few hours
---
Yeah, I'm not gonna miss that. It's been one of the reasons I'm looking forward to Blizz servers so much.
---
Just wanted to say OP, thanks for putting this together. I had no idea flight paths had changed their animations at all, but now that they have I can't unsee it. The original verison is so much better and immersive. I really hope they fix this before launch because while it may seem small, you spend so much time on a flight path in Classic that this change is  necessary for authenticity's sake, and for immersion.
---
Miss-stress
---
Good old 1% spell miss in tbc. What were they thinking?
---
But it’s not 500. It’s a lot closer to 1 million subs, 1000 beta slots, 30 streamers of note.
---
If you get R14 gear, it won't matter
---
ur not gna get banned lmao
---
Such a noob. Has streamed the game for several years and has an entire career built on entertaining a mass audience, hosting competitions and doing content to a good level enough for thousands to watch but yeah. He’s a super fucking boon dude. You got him.
---
Don't forget that classic was actually designed to be a casual game
---
IDK why, but your dot work is incredibly endearing
---
I've learned there's lot of misinformation on how Vanilla WoW was.
---
No, it's definitively not the same. You must have had some very mild experiences.
---
I don't think your friend played in vanilla lol
---
He is not wrong you know...
---
I thought this was going to be about "Peggy Forever", the ventrilo harassment video.
---
Had to be done.
---
Do you recall what defence you needed to tank raids? 525 maybe?
---
Yeah that's fine imo. As long as people who are playing are actually reporting the bugs they find.
---
You should just do a comp like ‘guess the number between 1-100’ and whoever wins send it to them
---
Hey this is my server.

Battlestations, men! Someone get Omar on the hotline!!!1
---
True and Shadowmourne "tanks".
---
that sounds interesting. But is it actually doable? even with good luck on drops?
---
There's no reason as to why they wouldn't be in the game.
---
Ja, ik wel em wel. Verzending nr België valt nog wel mee denk ik. Maar je zegt zuiden van Nederland? Nederlandse grens is niet zo ver, kan em misschien nog wel kome hale? :d
---
Mixed up Shimmering Flats with Desolace. Either way, since Wrath I have pretty much leveled up almost exclusively in dungeons until current content. Outside of maybe Zulfurrak and... some parts of BFD? I don't think many of them have the basilisks, and I'm not sure if those have the stare or not.
---
Im no expert either. But i think the pro’s of the orc severely outweigh the melee distance advantage.
---
You stick with 1h and shield with a spell power build and just go with repentance and vengeance with SoC for burst. Wasn't bosac baseline? Dunno why you're listing it as a point for holy.
---
Don’t worry about what the internet says about anything in your life. They have no idea
---
You can't make this stuff up
---
I still have a feeling blizzard is going to re-release some of these for the classic launch
---
Cool, I'm interested! Whereabouts in the south of the Netherlands?
---
Classic is an immersive mmorpg that we can get lost in and immerse ourselves in. Current retail is everyone we loved, but gutted out and left with nothing more than "do your dailies, grind your rep." That's all that's left of it now.
---
Stancedancing is a joke. You just basically macro correct stance on every ability and play normally.
---
Sure, guilds disbanding left and right during Uldir and BoD was because raiding is super accessible right now.
---
I thought Overpower was a guaranteed hit? But I haven’t played warrior, so idk, I just remember that in Vanilla I was told as a rogue not to use evasion against warriors (also wrong) because overpower is a guaranteed hit... what am I remembering wrong?
---
[Here's a comparison of Vanilla (P-server, but so far matches Classic fairly well) and retail nights.](https://imgur.com/a/BJw8RQT)
---
I've discussed this with some people before. From what we gathered, it's possible people mis-remember how dark the nights were for a number of reasons, possibly including...
---
* Computer screens back in the day weren't half as good as they're now.
---
* Potential gamma changes within the game.
---
* At one point Blizzard really did screw up the night. It was a bug that's been fixed since, but has come to live on as a myth. 
---
* The dark nights present in early versions of the game, where torches were needed to navigate. Duskwood was one such area. It never made it to live, but the myth might live on. 
---
* The way light interacts with the world has been changed. For example if you compare the Darkshore images, you'll see the vanilla version has a bold shadow on the character, whereas the retail one makes it look like my elf is luminescent. I've confirmed during the official stress test that the dramatic shadows will return in classic. 
---
* The color of certain zones and their light has drastically changed. The Barrens is a prime example, having gone from a calming green to a reddish tint.
---
Must be why we get 4,000+ pages of people wanting flying asap.
---
https://media2.giphy.com/media/7AAaiZ93xA7iU/giphy.gif
---
I think this is it more than anything.
---
I'm a druid main but it does sting a bit that even if you like healing (i do) you know the raw output of paladins and priests is really hard to beat. Just the simple fact that their heals are WAY faster than yours is really frustrating in raids.
---
Theres plenty of people that want to heal, so while druid gets shoe horned into that spot most healers would just rather be a "better" healer and not have to worry about doing a bunch of extra work to be a good druid
---
Why is it interesting?
---
Man, what's up with the quality of posts these days...you can't just share a random screenshot and leave it here with no comment, and make me have to open imgur on top of that...
---
If I had to boil it all down:
---
Wow brought min maxing to the forefront of gaming. In Bc and late Vanilla I was on a quest to get better. I was paying attention in math class so o could apply what I’d learned to my theorycrafting. TBf, I learned to love math cause of wow theorycrafting. So were lots of people, when I started playing WoW, I was concerned with my armor matching, such that I didn’t wear uncommon sand bought white sets from the blacksmith in red ridge, cause it looked better. By the time I had mathed out my mp5/ spr conversions I would be seeing games differently for the rest of my life. I used to be the guy who explored every corner of a dungeon for a hidden cache. Now I care about deep mechanical understanding of combat stats. 
---
Is it baD, is it good? I dunno, before wow the only genre that got autistic over numbers was Fighting Game players, reviewing frame data, etc. 
---
Even theorycrafting in game that were already out ticked up after wow came out. For instance, d2. I still play that, and most of the spreadsheet data we use for builds, came out after wow was released. Not cause we couldn’t derive it, but because no one asked the questions necessitating the answers till people experienced wow. 
---
Maybe it’s totally anecdotal, but as I look back I see the change in the type of knowledge gamers seek out as the main reason for why we all got better.
---
They have since made the nights darker than what they were in classic, even without the potion buff.
---
Oh you have the whole evening to play and don't have to start at midnight? Poor you. This is going to throw my cat's sleep schedule way off.
---
The one thing about the warlock epic mount quest is if you have a group of warlocks that all pitch in, or just pay someone who has the items for the final summon, you can get the epic dreadsteed for dirt cheap. I know for a fact back in the day we just had all the warlocks in the guild share the costs and just ran it once for everyone to get it.
---
Same. I got into wow whenTBC came out. Always been my favorite. all was awesome too but after that.... not so much imo. I just hope if they do re release the expansion to the classic servers they do it over a span of years so you have lots of time to sit and enjoy them before needing to move on.
---
NANI?!?!
---
Ah sorry you're correct.
---
Level eightteen four strenght four stam leather belt.
---
Sauce?

Right. Let her really enjoy the game, then y'all can decide on that later.
---
* No block
---
* No parry
---
* No shield wall
---
* No last stand
---
* No Livegiving Gem
---
* No in-combat consumables
---
* No AoE tanking
---
* Can be crushed
---
* Can be crit
---
* No secondary taunt
---
* Primary taunt has a longer CD
---
Are there fights a druid can tank? Sure, some fights it's just magic damage.
---
Are those a majority of fights in raids? No.
---
Should your guild consider a druid MT for progression raids? Absolutely fucking not
---
No, you log back in where you were in the instance. 
---
If you reset the instance, log out, then log back in, you will be placed right outside the instance.
---
Thank you, just wanted to be sure. Have a nice day
---
What's the joke here?  Can paladins cleanse while sheeped?  Did he have a trinket?  Was he supposed to bubble?
---
You too!
---
I didnt play warrior but I remember you had to "stance dance" to use certain  abilities e.g. to break fears etc.
---
As a healing priest you needed to use multiple ranks of heals for mana efficiency. 
---
I think in some classes cases it's not that rotations were harder or more complex.... it's more that you had to resource me age far more effectively to get the most out of your class....
---
Prefer him way more than that alexsensual guy.
---
I know hunters put their pets away in dungeons as to not pull too many mobs or w.e, do warlocks also put their demons away?
---
It always blows my mind how many people select the Human race in whatever MMO they are playing. It’s a RPG and you can be whatever you want and people decide to be the same boring human they are IRL
---
I'd say look for the smaller streamers in general, they tend to be more sensible. The big streamers are often total clowns and egomaniacs, I want nothing to do with them.
---
Check out RicketToo for some general hunter and druid classic gameplay.
---
23 in a guild of almoat exclusively adults. Looking back the pride we had in being good when our competition were probably a bunch of kids is funny.
---
that one is dependant if i remember right.
---
It can't be dodged or parried like other abilities, but you can still miss if not hit capped.
---
Transfers existed in vanilla :)
---
Warlocks use imps in dungeons.
---
I was illustrating my point with arbitrary numbers as to simplify without making assumptions.
---
Seeing as how 98% of my playtime will be at night, I’m actually not stoked about this 😅 still holding out hope that some servers in Western US will follow another time zone so that I get to play at least some of the game during daylight.
---
Maybe people want to keep them in their imgur image galleries so they don't have to bookmark every Reddit thread to find their own photos or maybe they link those images elsewhere and don't want to constantly link to Reddit or have anyone know who they are on Reddit?
---
Nah. None of those or any of the other dozen reasons it's nice to curate your own albums somewhere like imgur.
---
With then amount of skill and knowledge we have now compared to then, it is unlikely that we even need to raid with more than 30-35 players, let alone using consumables all the time.
---
Pokimane. Lol jk.
---
StaySafeTV anyone??? Spergs unite!
---
Coming from someone who is horrible at PVP , never even tried to get better ; world PVP wasn’t supposed to be only at places you decided to engage . Part of the excitement in classic was I knew I could get wrecked in any zone and I better avoid people when I see them because I can’t fight them lol
---
He can't turn invisible, that's a metaphorical in-game interpretation. The steath animation just did not sync with the walking speed untill pre-bc patch. I can't see how that could be intentional.
---
Warlocks either use an imp or they spec DS/Ruin and sacrifice their pet.
---
I don't get it
---
No :)
---
Thanks man. Will delete the post now since it's offtopic.
---
Not nearly as complex. You didn't have as many abilities that synergized.
---
Because of Spell Batching both rogues sapped each other. While in retail WoW the better PC, faster internetspeed, low latancy will get the first sap.
---
Hunters? Mana problems holding them back? Huh? Lol
---
I did it as a priest with my grand marshal warrior buddy in Stratholme; we did it prior to T3, as that's how we farmed exalted. Probably not efficient but it was fun, and we both got rivendare's mount from it (and free Naxx attunement).
---
yeah you don't need to actually play retail
---
Yeah that’s casually questions non stop without dicking around with professions and just general nonsense
---
Pokimane was given beta access and didn't know how to type in party

I used to use imgur a lot more than reddit and it was my main image hosting site. When I tried to upload an image here directly into the comments it would paste and show up fine but not actually post when I'd submit the comment. Figured it just didn't work, and I've never bothered to check where you actually upload images otherwise.
---
So unless anyone fancies telling me that I can paste an image somewhere to upload it I'll probably still use imgur.

---
In general rotations are far simpler. Both warlock and Mage are pretty much spamming x-bolt and managing mana. 
---
Warriors and rogues are some of the more complex rotations, but most rotations are further simplified but the fact that there are limited debugging slots which means that you don't get to use dots in most cases.
---
Yeah 8 days is casually questing non stop. That’d have to be no professions or general nonsense for me to hit 60 in 8 days played
---
No, problem.
---
This seems to be focused primarily on a streamer and not Classic content, so has been removed as a Rule #1. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
No. All tamed beasts have the same stats as any other member of their pet family. The only rare exception is caster beasts with mana bars have an inferior alternative stat distribution with more int/spi and less of other stats.
---
&gt; what incentive would people have to move?
---
A fresh realm with less competition for resources, etc. This kind of thing already happened when the game first launched, because back then it was also outgrowing the existing realms. Many guilds migrated off their crowded realms onto fresh ones.
---
yes. in any moment a hunter would put a pet away, a warlock should also do the same. especially if you're jumping down to a different path, like in Wailing Caverns.
---
Here's what the nights actually look like on Classic (and original Vanilla):

---
Enhancer is bad dps? That's a bummer I wanted to play one :( is ele any good at least?
---
/u/esfandTV get on it bro
---
I didnt see it but Winterspring Tiger is an alliance daily rep mount.
---
IIRC Fura was hired by the GM of curse to run the guild when he stepped back to focus on the cursegaming site.
---
I watch stormx and ebn because I like druids :)
---
You also do need an active subscription for a chance of stress invite
---
Thank you for the suggestions and tips everyone, they were helpful!
---
No-one gets a 'key', thats not how it works.
---
&gt; The scary part is, this isn't an if, it's a how many servers don't dwindle in population.
---
You can't know that. It's equally likely that 75% of the launch population ends up quitting within two months, given Classic's massive tourism appeal.
---
Just because he’s got a large fan base and makes money from streaming does not make him good at the game.
---
It's cool, thanks for the explanation
---
I did not share the specific name of the pserver, or do you think that just mentioning the name "pserver" is going to be a revelation for someone? 
---
And, I was discouraging the use of pservers.
---
Madseason's voice is so monotone that when he's uttering something with a sense of character (laughter, cacophonous noice), then you're instantly satisfied.
---
You could do most vanilla content without timers. Doing it without threat meters sounds dumb. 
---
Further, it’s ass end retarded to disallow an addon when you’re learning a boss...then allowing people a cheat sheet once you’ve learned it...given you learned the boss without a mod, you clearly don’t need one to kill it on farm.
---
There are not many bosses where mechanics interact in nonrepeatable and non predictable ways. In fact there aren’t many fights where multiple mechanics are going off in the first place. 
---
So that said, unlikely to find a guild doing this. If you want to introduce a bit of legitimate challenge, try to bring a balanced raid comp. 5 of each class. (You’ll need 8 warriors if going all the way, so 8 warriors, 4 lock, 4 hunt, 4 Druid—5 of everything else)
---
You used to not be able to transfer from Pve-&gt;pvp but you can now in retail, so who knows if we can in classic
---
Doesn’t exactly make him a noob either.
---
I hope so too. I've come accross some interesting ideas in this sub, one solution was something like:
---
- Your flying mount has stamina. There's a lot, but when it runs out, you gotta land.
---
- The higher you fly, the more stamina you use up. Or alternatively, gaining altitude eats stamina (incentivizes flying low).
---
- Taking damage knocks you off your flying mount. 
---
So ranged DPS can knock you off your mount. People have to fly within range if they want to cover good distance. There's still player interaction and flying
---
You won’t be getting a beta invite so don’t worry
---
When wow came out, none of us had experience with it. And it consumed us all. So of course go ahead!
---
I've been called lots of things, but if i am the bad guy because i shrug it off and call others to simply ignore people, then so be it.
---
Going forward if we see Tbc released would you like to see some sort of restriction to flying. Not completely though as some quests require it for access.
---
It's an advantage for Taurens in PvP.
---
Orcs are still better.
---
Hunter can't maintain their damage over long fights, I remember ours using mana pots and possibly the druid thing to get big damage out. It's too costly to cast multi shot  on CD with everything else, unless that's different in 1.12 cos I honestly don't remember when what change came in. Their damage is never bad with just normal damage either
---
A 34 undead mage shot s froatbolt at me the other day when we were killing a STV croc. I’m a 43 mage with my 43 hunter partner. I’m going to assume that was you lol. ReD EqUaLs DeAd
---
Abbreviations are a problem still for us (e.g., LH), but otherwise, we remove posts that are focusing on discussing private server gameplay experiences, especially those specific to private servers (e.g., over crowded). r/wowservers is more appropriate for this post.
---
Choo Choo motherfucker
---
2-3 nights a week from 7pm sound dreamy to me, is that's what's find be considered casual I don't know what I'm gonna be ;) 
---
But yes, that will be just fine for most guilds, even more serious ones. If you're in a more hardcore guild though, you would likely be expected to raid a bit more than that during progression.
---
I'm still hopeful they'll change their minds just because it's so goddamned stupid. More people need to let them know they want the mounts, though.
---
I'm sure they are rolling stuff out, just thought that it was a unique opportunity to do something different.
---
Would you use master loot in that case?
---
first of all warlocks dps in PVE is pretty trash, you wont be using agony u will be using a different cruse that helps ur raid to more damage.  u will most likely have 2-4 warlocks in your raid putting different curses up. from MC to naxx unless ur a god u wont be out dpsing the other classes. 
---
the most annoying shit in PVE people wont tell you before you roll a warlock though? health stones. get ready for every warrior, healer, and mage or rogue who thinks they carry the raid group to be asking u for a health stone after every fight.
---
Whats the best streamer for mage class ( with focus on great pvp skills)
---
Well in classic's case, it wont be that bad. As i said, if it's severe, if it's the "N" word then tell me, i'd write in his favor as well. I think i made it pretty clear that some extreme cases like your example should get the offender a ban.
---
Nope. You would just leave if someone doesn't leave the grey for you to grab.
---
But then again they could refrain from babysitting us and just let people rush if they want to. Every other grind is still in the game. PvP ranking is going to be far less healthy but apparently people don't need protecting from that.
---
You think "raids not being accessible" is the reason players leave BfA? The worst expansion in WoW history?
---
Both are bad raid dps, really bad. Even the other hybrids do more dps in their hybrid specs (except oomkin). Ele is good in pvp but goes oom too fast in raids and has no synergy with anything. Enhance is lol of course. You might beat the tanks if you try I suppose. If you go shaman, and your guild is any good, you'll be healing in raids.
---
A good priest can kill as holy, too.
---
I'm sure this would happen regardless as they aren't mutually exclusive with multiple servers. This isn't a prediction, just an idea I haven't heard anyone mention.
---
Theres 1000 people in my beta guild alone...beta is more than 1000
---
It’s an MMORPG not an esport. I know that’s hard for you fortnite kids to understand.
---
&gt;The dark nights present in early versions of the game, where torches were needed to navigate. Duskwood was one such area. It never made it to live, but the myth might live on.
---
Actually from what I can tell, that Duskwood where torches were needed is a complete fabrication. Here's a couple screenshots that date back to October of 2003, on Blizzard's website: [https://web.archive.org/web/20031002232528/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=18&amp;Set=0](https://web.archive.org/web/20031002232528/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=18&amp;Set=0)

---
Was this streamed and if so is there a VOD of it?
---
I'm sure they'll perform rewrites that'll break your addon regardless. To think they'll allow an LFG/R addon is ridiculous considering the potential for community wide backlash.
---
Why would Blizzard waste an invite on someone that isn't subscribed to their game?
---
But you are unable to reset the instance while inside am I not correct?
---
This would kill way too many solo dungeon farms including Maraudon, DME and maybe more
---
I've done a bit of raiding in WOTLK and I'm thinking of seriously raiding in classic this year. I'm still doubting if I want to join a pvp or pve realm. Does playing on a pvp realm impact the raiding scene in any way? Do PVE realms have better raiding guilds?
---
Night was never really that dark in WoW.  Yes, there is a clear difference between Vanilla and the more recent expansions, but night was never known to be dark in World of Warcraft.  This is for the practical reason that a WoW day is an Earth day.  No one wants to have their only available play time be in the pitch black like it was in Everquest.  In EQ it was so dark you couldn't find your way out of caves without a light source.

---
What are your opinions on Orc Hunter animations between the male and female? I'm kinda torn between the two. I love the Trolls animations but no shoes + lack of 25% stun resist is tough.
---
I'm sure that for most people that's the primary attraction. I don't know what you are taking issue with here. They are re-releasing a twenty year old game, hard to not bank on nostalgia as the driving force behind it's consumption.
---
They have said in interviews that they are open to doing this if the fanbase is still there and supports it. Pretty rad !
---
Keep in mind that layering is within the same server and will be tapered off as people spread out through the different zones, it's not like sharding where you see people from other servers.
---
RIP dreams of riding a fast tall ram. The new epic mount model looks far less majestic.
---
People are going to rush 60 anyways...
---
ah yeah, but even with that build the shamans are mostly healing, right? Also isn't the druid FC build basically resto with some pvp specific talents?
---
You can reset it from inside the instance with the "/script ResetInstances()" macro in 1.12.
---
I do as well, but am really struggling on deciding, everyone seems to advise against it. I also want to be Alliance, which means I won’t be undead for that sweet devouring plague that they get. It’s tough to decide!
---
It's a benefit to holy over ret because you cannot CC a holy without extreme coordination from your priest(s) due to the pala being far away, the rogue or mage cannot just spam cc like they want to. They also cannot just attack the pala, too tanky. Ret has none of those, they are in range of others and if you play them with sp build and 1h/shield you are just plain retarded, at that point you are an inferior holy. No one would consider attacking you in the first place because Pala teams regularly run hunters/warriors who fuck shit up with pala support.
---
Layering is sharding with another name so people don't blast them for introducing sharding.
---
Nearly every class has simpler rotations. Some classes are spamming one spell for the entire fight. Arms doesn't really have a place in PVE, so here's Fury:
---
Classic/Vanilla:
---
1. Spam Execute when you can.
---
2. Use Bloodthirst every 6 seconds.
---
3. Use Whirlwind every 10 seconds.
---
4. Use Overpower whenever it pops.
---
5. Queue Heroic Strike to dump rage.
---
Retail:
---
1. Use Rampage if not Enraged or at &gt; 90 Rage.
---
2. Use Recklessness every 30 seconds.
---
3. Use Siegebreaker every 30 seconds.
---
4. Spam Execute when you can (or whenever Sudden Death procs).
---
5. Use Bloodthirst if not Enraged.
---
6. Use Raging Blow at two charges.
---
7. Use Bloodthirst every 4.5 seconds.
---
8. Use Bladestorm when Enraged.
---
9. Use Raging Blow when in need of Rage.
---
10. Use Whirlwind.
---
Vanilla was incredibly simple compared to progression raiding today.
---
+5 weapon damage doesn't matter that much and you get 5% crit from axe spec which is miles better than mace spec. And you won't outpace it. The only other realistic weapon till med 40s is Bonebiter, also a an axe. Also arms is just better at 40
---
Well then I will love you forever!
---
He clicks abilities he has bound to keys 1-3. 
---
He’s a noob.
---
repentance has a big cd when hammer is already there, repentance vs what holy brings. Tough choice /s
---
Regardless of where there are keys or not. You’re not getting an invite. They have all the testers they need.
---
I did those benchmarks ;) For classic an APU will be sufficient by a lot, while in terms of cheap laptops likely similar mobile Ryzen APUs. Still wanting to test one and something with UHD 620 as there is a lot of those super cheap atom-intel based laptops. MX150 based on GT 1030 should be comparable or even bit faster than Vega 8 in AMD R3 APUs.
---
That sounds really dumb tbh, why would you actively handicap your raiders and limit them by disallowing addons, especially something like a threat meter.
---
It's not required but it definitely gives you an edge.  You can win some fights based off your engineering that you would've lost without it.  I'd say anyone that's planning to spend the majority of their time PVPing would benefit more from engineering than any other profession.  Most people don't just do pvp though so it's not the right choice for everyone, and of course one can still do good in pvp without engineering.
---
Similar, I quit after my guild downed Gruul in TBC, which was about 2-3 months in if IIRC. I was ecstatic about flying mounts but quickly decided that they ruined the game after I realized that they pretty much ruined all forms of World PvP.
---
Flying mounts were insidious as hell.  Everyone was super excited for them and the Nether Drake patch when TBC hit.  I loved Flying mounts!  I was wrong.
---
The only two things Blizzard can do to break our addon is:
---
1. Not make chat channels global (they won't do this).
---
2. Not let addons use chat (they won't do this).
---
Oh.. we knew
---
Nice vid
---
Splitting the playerbase into "this half goes and plays TBC" and "this half does something new and different" is a good way to make sure both populations die.
---
You won’t be able to do this in classic
---
&gt; The memories of fire balling my first wolves in the human starting area are still ingrained in my brain
---
I remember getting frost nova as clear as day, what a feeling, such POWER
---
Everything seems to be a video guide on YouTube these days. Any resources that I can just read, similar to mmo champ?
---
These are the kind of questions that deserve answers. Pming a dev as we speak. (its actually an interesting question)
---
You won’t get 60 in a week bro, it’s not possible lol
---
Ah, then rogue is not a great choice.
---
Damn you sound ignorant, I played WoW on release and never even touched Fortnite...having a full time job, wife, and kids it’s hard to remember how the game was when I was in high school, jerk.
---
I was standing at Max range.
---
Thank you for bringing this heinous crime to light.
---
Your classic rotation is inefficient . Look up hamstring method.
---
Holy shit, what an absolute boomer comment.
---
Eh, the biggest thing is on a PvE realm you'll have an easier time farming things out in the open world. There are going to be great guilds on both PvE and PvP realms.
---
It's probably because he's awful

Seriously though, druids can do some of the most unique things in the game because of their versatility. If you're new to the game and don't particularly care about topping meters, please don't listen to the folks who say druids are 'bad'. This is an example that shows some of the cool stuff druids are capable of.
---
Preach 🙌
---
This probably was the reason I couldn't put my finger on why the game didn't quite feel like vanilla.
---
PC mag the pre-thottbot/wow head days. I still to this day have around +50 issues laying around gathering dust. For some reason, I cant get rid of them way to many good memories.
---
Yeah people on this sub are generally trash tier players who never really played with the high end premade groups. The game is a lot of fun in premades but if you play something like ret you are a complete burden on your team (not even skilled palas are allowed a slot as ret if the game is anything serious). Hybrid builds etc, all garbage just play holy it's more useful regardless of how you try to spin it.
---
You won't get much info out of this sub anyway, there are people who would defend druid, the class is worthless outside of flag carrying.
---
In any case, feel free to roll priest you can do shadow in your free time. It's fine for 5man dungeons with gear and wpvp, shit for coordinated pvp and a joke in PvE.
---
Once you are geared as a raid group you can begin collecting PvE gear for shadow. Once AQ hits PvP will be a joke and people go back to privates because AQ gear is a world of a difference to BWL etc.
---
Essentially you are unable to play PvP once AQ is out without AQ gear. It'll be a requirement to wear it because of how it makes all other gear pale in comparison (and let's not even talk about naxx, that gear is better than some lvl 70 tbc items).
---
headed to the same place
---
its WoW Classic, not WoW vanilla, yes the base is Vanilla but the name is Classic for a reason just havent figured out Blizz's end game yet
---
we weren't part of the bfa community
---
Yikes.
---
On if you have melee?
---
 No problem bro. Not at all. &lt;3
---
No, people just got better monitors.
---
I'd be a customer
---
Fixed, still just as simple.
---
Enemy cast bars isn’t ai lol
---
It's extremely suited for this type of play.
---
In Vanilla I ran a PUG Molten Core group every Friday night that cleared the instance in 3-4 hours.  I will do the same in Classic.  I'm sure plenty of people will.
---
Level at your pace and then join PUGs.  Almost everyone is going to be on adult time.  My plan is to have drinking game MC's where we get together and tell stories while killing bosses and giving no fucks about the "Elite" guilds who are doing content I and many other mastered 14 years ago.  I raided a lot in Vanilla, and the absolute best times were the stories and trash talk.  You don't need a guild to have that, just a PUG with a lot of frequent flyers.
---
Isn’t it “what a long, strange trip it’s been”?
---
I was refering to good reputation on the server.
---
No snutz is a good player.
---

---
Have fun

don't even think about playing vanilla for the raid rotations

Darkshore is one of my favorite zones across all versions of World of Warcraft. Cataclysm Darkshore had some good quests, and the Warfront is both gorgeous and fun (ignoring the bad writing of Malfurion and Tyrande). But pretty as they are, how I've missed the original version. I can't wait to get back to Auberdine in August.
---
No addons?  No.
---
Threatmeter only?  Yeah sure.  I don't think I ever really used timers, we just had good communications on voice.  That said, when you do something like C'thun, I have no idea how you could do that boss fight without the C'thun mod.
---
I dno, ask the just chatting crew, featuring pokimane, trainwreckz etc. xD
---
Fury spams 3 buttons instead of 1-2 which makes it the more interesting spec in the game.
---
Sorry mate but what is a PUG?
---
I knew flying mounts were a mistake minutes after I got my first flying mount. "Holy shit PVP is going to be so sick in the air!" was my first thought. Then I found out there was no mounted PvP. To avoid every bad thing in the world all you had to do was just hop on your mount and fly away. All player interaction from traveling is completely eliminated. 
---
If 18 year old me can figure out that flying would kill the game, how the fuck did this blunder manage to make it into retail?
---
So much this. With the exception of paladin (because I’ll be horde) and hunter, I’ve switched between wanting to roll nearly every class.
---
You can do all of that and more in retail—in a fraction of the time, so your accompishments are devalued to the level of achievement similar to tying your shoe. The game is so dumbed down and forgiving now that it’s like you’re playing with training wheels. Who the hell cares if you can ride a bike around the block with training wheels? The ladies want the guy on his motorcycle popping a wheelie, not some toddler who mashed a few buttons and got himself a legendary.
---
Pick up group
---
If your LFG addon uses chat and not some independent UI that networks players together then it's already pretty useless isn't it?
---
In some of them, but they brought it back to Vanilla levels during Legion I believe.
---
Male for sure, it's the only class where orc males get to stand up straight for the majority of their animations
---
Maybe like an ultra powerful trinket type item. 2-5 mins of use, 1 hour CD, something like that.
---
THAT'S THE PHRASE!
---
I couldn't remember what it was supposed to be so I ended up with *wild* instead. I think it still works, but thank you for scratching that itch, it would've bothered me all day otherwise.
---
This isn't a prediction of what is going to happen, it's an idea I haven't heard anyone say. And Classic itself is a population "fork", it's not going to kill retail (and if it does, well, people are still paying their subs).
---
It is an independent UI that networks players together. Using the chat protocol is how the addon communicates between players.
---
JUMP TO DODGE
---
I mean, When i write "Classic movies" i get the Godfather, and it always has the same story and actors. I don't expect Johnny Depp replacing Pacino one day...
---
I mean..."Classic" as a word has pretty well defined meaning which often if not always is used about something that was considered "The best in it's time".
---
If you see this to mean changes when it comes to WoW, then it would definitely not be because it is called "Classic" instead of "Vanilla.
---
Blizzard end game is to get their investment in Classic tenfold, by hype alone and then make even more profit in the long term. It's pretty easy to sustain the Cloud based servers and few GM's that will most likely be across all their WoW related stuff, than starting to work on WoW while working on WoW... 
---
Their end game is money, and i'd say they already covered their investment.
---
Definitely could be. My memory is ruined by years of playing pservers tbh.
---
Slower and more calculated in general.
---
haven't really found anything online regarding the specc. do you have any videos healing with the build or how its specced? really interested
---
Raids being hard to sustain due to high requirements being the reason raiding guilds disband? Nah my dude, its the pvp requirements that make raiding guilds disband.
---
Especially when everyone who raids aknowledges that both Uldir and BoD are great raids.
---
Anything, friend. Enjoy that beta.
---
Dude I agree! He’s the best!
---
Vanilla was not about raids, the classes were designed for the leveling and dungeons so you have tons of situational/utility spells but very poor boss rotation
---
This is a useful text resource:  [https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?t=1091](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?t=1091)
---
love it! thanks for showing me this
---
Honestly its really enjoyable from both of those aspects
---
 OC I actually like for once.
---
Guess I got mythed too.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Again, yes you can clear with 10-15 people, the question isn’t clearing the raid, it’s clearing as quickly as possible to finish your raid nights in as few nights as possible. When you have to clear MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, and AQ each week I promise you that you’ll wish people were buffing. If your guild is good and keeps everyone alive and doesn’t wipe ever, your consumables will go very far and it won’t cost very much to fully buff for MC/BWL/Ony.
---
I plan to roll an alliance rogue and I would appreciate some feedback on three questions: 
---
1) I have heard that engineering gives you a real edge in PvP and even PVE. Is this true? I am not a hardcore player but I would be disappointed if another rogue was doing say 20% more DPS because of that profession (presuming fear and skill level are the same). 
---
2) Somewhat related to the above, I was planning on rolling skinning and leatherworking, but I am not a fan of sticking around in lower level areas (e.g. doing green quests) just because of the required level of skinning. Presuming that I skin most mobs, is the process pretty smooth? 
---
3) If I had to choose two professions that allowed me to generate a steady revenue stream, what would they be? I have found that alchemy and herbalism is great, but perhaps two gathering professions (like skinning/herbalism) is better? 
---
Thanks :) 
---
P.S: Taking all three questions into consideration, I am not against leveling one to x, making gold from it and then dropping it for another later on, presuming that there is a logical reason for it.
---
Ok thanks, enjoy 15 year old content I already played.
---
And shadow priests with slowfall. I'm playing a tbc server right now and catching up to people with my epic flying mount and dotting them in midair and watching them slowly die is amazing.
---
Well yes and no. Like I mentioned above, fights in PvE have to be short so a good Ret Paladin profits from a other good dps classes immensely. In PvP though, like I also mentioned the ability no nearly permastun enemys while slapping the shit out of them makes it so incredible op.
---
I don't recall many classes having much of a rotation in Vanilla.
---
i completely agree with everything you said! sorry for not being clear myself, but i was indeed replying to the guy talking about retail. i can't wait for classic!
---
Is the fact that Gnomes have no healer classes evidence that they are being suppressed to support the Alliance?
---
\#gnomeregansecession
---
Depends on class. If you play frost mage then you literally just click frost bolt
---
Yes they have!
---
Apes isn't a Vanilla guild, it's a Pserver guild.
---
Agreed. The meme that TBC killed world pvp is way over exaggerated. There was TONS of world pvp in tbc back in the day.
---
That's what people don't understand, if you get a spec that does half the damage of a "pure" dps/tank class you have people saying "I don't do carry jobs" or other things, even if you personally have no issue. 
---
And it's not unwaranted either, lower dps means higher run times, risk of wipes, higher repair cost etc
---
Oh yeah, absolutely. At graphics setting 3 it looks really good actually and has the vanilla look. No problem. Happy to answer questions about the beta
---
Best vanilla guild was Nihilum, though...
---
You do need an active sub, but they're done giving out invites except for Friends &amp; Family.
---
Private server community is but a tiny fraction of the people playing classic, so people saying alliance are going to dominate are only basing it off of pserver communities. 
---
I think it’s personally going to slightly favor horde, a lot of people checking
---
So just because you play on a Pserver means you should get a Classic beta invite?
---
Wow.
---
Make consumable pvp items or a trinket that drags people to the ground and dismounts them. I think I saw this item in BFA actually but never got a chance to use it.
---
You won't learn much more from APES players running around on stream than you will the others. Certainly not while leveling to 30 lol
---
Yea maybe they'll test more pertinent shit....But some one will do that work by time it's relevant to us on live anyway. 
---
Source: I play on p servers and judging by the bigger discords where pvpers are at no one seems all that worried about the beta. Apes or otherwise 
---
This is the end to teh private server scene better to spend your time burning your banks on the p servers than leveling on beta
---
Because it's not true; that's why I take issue with it. Nostalgia is a fleeting commodity that evaporates when the reminiscer realizes their memories were rosier than reality. MMOs don't get multi-year subscribers from nostalgia. They get subscribers from consistent, long-term quality gameplay. Blizzard would have never released Classic on the basis of nostalgia, because that's a terrible business model.
---
Why did they release it? Because they had a million or so accounts scattered across buggy pirate servers, playing routinely for years on end. And when they shut down a popular one, the community outburst was so massive that they realized the potential customer base was far larger than even that. They believe the number of people who genuinely think Classic is a better game than retail is large enough that it warrants a rerelease, which they didn't think in past years.
---
I am one of those people. I don't want Classic because I have fond memories of it from 13 years ago. In fact my memories are largely polluted because I was in an abusive guild and didn't leave until shortly before BC. I want Classic because I believe, with good reason, that it is a better, more immersive, more satisfying gameplay experience than anything that came after Cataclysm. I want it because it's one of the best games I've ever played in my life, absent any influence of nostalgia. I *want* the months-long grinds. I *want* the resource competition. I *want* my progress to be destabilized by world PvP. I *want* my raids to be forty people large. I'm not deluded into having forgotten these timesinks. I *need* these timesinks to provide meaning and memory to my scant-yet-satisfying gear upgrades.
---
So yeah. Speak for yourself. This game isn't selling on the basis of nostalgia, and it's certainly not going to stick around on such pretenses. It's selling because it fills an important niche in the MMO market that has been absent for years, and the players who want it know this about themselves. To reduce it to "nostalgia" is misleading and myopic.
---
As someone playing almost solely for pvp but no time to nolife, that sucks.
---
What’s the difference between Retail and Retail Warfront?
---
I haven’t played Retail since Cataclysm, so just about everything in Retail sounds like an Alien Language to me.
---
Yes, if you're going from A to C with B between and you logout/DC before reaching B (you don't pay for B-&gt;C until reaching B), then you'll log back in at B.
---
Obviously they were talking about the to-be-released version of classic wow which includes some quality of life changes like battle.net friendlist, which was also not part of vanilla
---
Allow mounted combat but with a heavy penalty to accuracy based on how fast you are going. This way someone basically has to stay still if they want any realistic chance to hit, giving the opponent a chance to defend. Also make flying mounts more visible. Being in the air should paint a big red target on your back for the opposing faction in PvP zones.
---
But that’s what happens to classic movies? They get remade.... maybe not the god father but dude. Plenty of classic movies are remade and with new actors...
---
I'm pretty sure I've been parried by a totem before. Just private server shenanigans or part of vanilla too? I'm not sure but you can be sure that I logged my rogue then and there.
---
Read this fully expecting the ending.   
---
Then spat out/inhaled my red bull because the ending was not what I expected.
---
MAGA! 
---
This phrase definitely applies to Azeroth.
---
Some are more complex and difficult than anything in retail WoW, Hunters MM rotation is insanely complex because while you generally use just 2 buttons, Aimed Shot and Multishot, the speed of which you fire your Autoshot differs not only with your range weapon, but also whatever buff you may or may not have. Playing a Hunter optimally is probably impossible due to how many variances there are. This in addition using FD to swap trinkets and weaving in melee attacks. 
---
Then there is the Frost Mage, who spams Frost Bolt.
---
I like this about the game, because some prefer complexity, while others do not, and the option is there. In Retail WoW, everyone plays through the designated rotation, which involves syngeriges and procs.
---
Suggested that you leveling tailoring first to get [truefaith vestments ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14154/truefaith-vestments).  
---
That chest piece is as good as or maybe better then T2, so you will be using it for more then half of wow's raid progression.  
---
The robes are bop, but do not have any tailoring requirement to wear.  So you can then drop tailoring.
---
I would join this guild, use all the addons I wanted, and be a god amongst these mortals with my perfect knowledge.
---
Source?
---
I believe it was mostly for caster bosses because it reduced armor and increased attack power. It's been a while so not 100 percent sure.
---
Mounting still takes 3 seconds and people were still farming materials in the world all the time. World pvp, ganking and corpse camping were all very much things in TBC. I agree flying needs more drawbacks, like there should be more items that dismount the rider, but people saying "TBC killed world pvp" is seriously over exaggerated.
---
Tanking services will make you a lot of gold. You can also make a strat live group for crusader orb farming / the mage water book (sells for a shit ton). I recommend getting the key for UBRS and selling key service, usually a quick 10g. E’ko farm groups in winter spring are another alternative. Killing low level earth elementals is a good choice too, solid stones and elemental earth are a hot commodity
---
Ok, thanks mate! Worried that the serious guilds might pick pve servers.
---
That’s what happens to a lot of “classic” movies and they have the same story with new actors so.... I don’t see anything I just am open to anything. Money is any companies end game game but there’s more to it than that...
---
I've been *attacked* by a Stoneskin totem on private servers in the past.
---
Wtf
---
You sound like a fun individual. There is undeniably a nostalgic bent to the marketing behind the relaunch of a 20 year old MMO. This seems reasonable to say.
---
Hunters and some other classes can just use whatever they find, but that's not really the case for rogues.  Depending on a rogue's spec, they're gonna stick with swords or they're gonna want to stick with daggers.  It's not worth it to switch to a sword while dagger specced even if it's a really good sword, and respeccing whenever you find a new weapon isn't a viable thing to do in vanilla.
---
Well as far as I remember (started end of bc) the reason you were standing behind mobs was so they couldnt parry.

Im jelous! Have a blast!
---
Not bad and I believe there's definitely a "market", or I should rather say a need for summary vids like this, for us guys who don't have the time to watch all those streams. If you'd appreciate some critical feedback, I'll just say there's too much streamer drama nobody cares about in your vid, and too little actual content. Put in more duelling and battleground moments next time!
---
Since you're planning to play for a long time, obv warrior. I'd go mage if i wanted more enjoyable leveling experience, do some dungeons/pvp, and then quit in 1-2 months.
---
Yeah, it's a huge fucking issue and nobody even seems to give a shit. I made a thread after the announcement and was buried in downvotes and people insulting me or saying "it doesn't matter." 
---
Like dude, the first R13s will start popping up two months after PvP goes live, and R14s a month later. If the servers are big enough, there's room for more than one new R14 per week and quite a few R12/13, per faction, per server. Somehow people think they'll never run into anyone with a high rank, but it's gonna be everywhere after a few months.
---
I don't know how much time I've spent pointing out to people that the 1.11 version of the R13 set is actually pretty much identical to T2.5 and a growing number of players will have it starting two months into phase 2. Noone wants to hear it. I don't know why.
---
You're in for a rough awakening when people decline you for being not orc. Roll orc.
---
I asked this question like 14 years ago when I was making my first character.  My brother who played original beta told me that it was proof that gnomes were the only truly evil race since they were wholly incapable of altruistic actions.  
---
Then turns out gnomes made my priest water, and I learned that to be not true.
---
Go wherever your friends are going because classic is always more fun with friends.
---
Thats called a remake. Last time i checked blizzard weren't exactly remaking WoW. Unless all we heard till now were lies.
---
A remake goes far above a simple "horizontal progression" which imples more of the same. A remake means an attempt (often botched) to cash on a cult classic. If you go with what often happens with these remakes, you would hope they never EVER try to do this with "Classic".
---
Apes? Who ?
---
Nah, most serious guilds will actually roll PVP realms because they know how much fun world pvp is in Vanilla.
---
I wish I was you. the chance to do it all over again, to experience everything from the beginning. You lucky fucker.
---
Agreed. I had mixed feelings on him as a content creator, but he’s definitely earned respect from me during his beta play. He’s been carrying Asmon through vanilla since lvl 1.
---
God damn that's some next level brain lag on ability usage and movement.
---
Despite what other people say, classic is just not that great for casuals. Have fun running the same dungeons from start to end of vanilla with no way to progress your gear outside of blues. A few months in, you will die in under 3 seconds against people in BWL/AQ gear.
---
Flying Mounts in TBC was awesome. It didn't seem like it ruined the engagement and community then. Kind of fit the lore of that expansion.
---
It was once they started adding flying to every expansion, and then when they put their foot down in WoD and said no, enough people bitched and they caved. Should have only had flying in TBC and that was it. MAYBE WOTLK in certain areas for raids, but even that's a stretch for me.
---
short answer: yes
---
long answer: fuck yes
---
Well I hope they add to it because talking about it clearly pisses you off....
---
I'll definitely take your advice ! Thank you for helping me out :)
---
There's a difference between "there's a nostalgic bent with some marketing" and "we all know that the primary appeal of Classic is nostalgia." One comment suggests that it's a component. One suggests that it's the *only* component, or the only one that matters. That is absolutely false to the hordes of players who have been playing pservers for years on end. Nostalgia may well be the guiding force behind retail tourists, but retail tourists are not expected to stay. In fact, they're so not expected to stay that Blizzard is implementing a new server technology specifically in anticipation of their not staying.
---
Might wanna consider tailoring for [Truefaith vestments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14154)
---
In theory, it makes sense to cover up your weakness as you said vs. Mage, Hunter and Lock, as you can stun them.
---
But in practice, you are not really going to be beating those classes as a Warrior solo. You likely wont be beating anyone as solo, as you are so easily kiteable. So instead of having 0% chance in a 1v1, you now have 0.2% with Warstomp. 
---
Orc stun resist manifests itself better in your ideal Warrior setup, a group where you are the front line. You charge in and you get attacked by 3-4 people as the healers are spamming you. In this situation, having stun resist can be huge. 
---
The same can be said for Escape Artist vs Human racials, EA seems better, but in ideal Warrior situations you want Human racials.
---
If nights actually looked like that in game I would be so stoked
---
I doubt you would keep a dagger if you got a good sword  or mace to drop. Sometimes the gear you want doesn't drop and you have to make do. You will also be poor, so you really don't get the luxary of deciding to be a dagger rogue or sword rogue, and you should spec with that in mind while leveling.
---
Great, thanks!

If you think it's exaggerated you must have never went to any pvp forums during tbc. The flying killed world pvp was literally a staple. Sure there was the occasional encounter without any long interaction, just like there is on retail now. But it totally killed any sense of group world pvp and stuff. The times where you would call in friends to help you get rid of this ganker.
---
I believe that this was during the first weeks :) To me, this video was an awesome gaming show! Of course after some months Drakedog and company appeared, but that's another story
---
Is the world map in the beta "remastered" IE more HD than on the old client? Can someone in the beta please screenshot the world map for me I'm working on a canvas/wall/print type map
---
There's been some amazing duels by Venruki this week, Esfand's battlegrounds have had some great battles - those two things come to my mind quickly!
---
But he’s right, in Legion they reverted the nights to how they were in vanilla.
---
You have your opinion but it is just an opinion.
---
1)  In pve the dps increase in minor and mostly related to using bombs and sapper charges.  Rogues aoe is very limited in pve, so some use engr to supplement it.  There are very few aoe boss fights.  Only the most hardcore pve guilds will be expecting rogues to be engr.  
---
In pvp and in 5mans, engr provides an insane amount of utility.  Stuns, damage, roots, spell damage reflectors, and jumper cables to try and rez someone.  In higher end pvp it is basically expected that a rogue is engr or you are considered deficient.  
---
2) Skinning is the smoothest profession to level while leveling.  As long as you don't dungeon spam and avoid beasts, you will kill plenty to stay with your skill level.  
---
Leatherworking as a profession is somewhat useless unless you get an ultra-rare pattern.  Most guilds have basically 1 max that gets fed recipes and makes onyixa scale cloaks for the guild.  
---
Herbalism and Mining make the most money.
---
Damn, after seeing how nice it looks with Inky Black Potion it makes me wish that was the baseline look.
---
No worries, you'll find a good guild on any server as long as you look!
---
Raid healing is really easy to play but hard to master. I'm a try hard when I heal, and crushed the heal charts in a server first guild in tbc, but as shaman, though the concept is the same. (I know heal charts aren't everything).
---
Remember, I didn't play a holy pally in vanilla, so take this with salt and as a guideline. So holy pally in raids, you can play two ways. Regardless, you'll likely be assigned to a tank to heal. You can either constantly cast flash of light, which you'll be able to do till the heat death of the universe without mana issues, then switch to the big heal when the tank takes spike damage.
---
Or other healing method, my preference when I heal, is to constantly cast your big heal but cancel it the moment it's about to go off should your tank not need it. This is definitely preferable for healers with lots of spirit, like priests, but is still a very fun and proactive way to do your job. It ensures that your tank will be above 50% hp for the fight.
---
There are other things a pally can do as well if you are a good player. Things like bubbling other players who are about to die, keeping seals up on the boss, and other things more experienced vanilla paladins will be able to add.
---
Misinformation to the max.
---
"If the enemy team doesn't have healers nearby". Some trash tier skill level does not make Spriest better than a druid.

Wait a second, somebody yesterday posted a bug that you can go from A to C without knowing discovering B beforehand even if it is an intermittent stop. Does that mean I can go from A to C, logout after starting the FP and then log back in to actually discover B because it will stop me at it?
---
It cut early but for the record, he put it in trade back to the guy, but he said it was fine and that it was hilarious
---
I feel like that was a good decision!
---
Explaining the meaning of the word "Classic" and the reason why remakes are made is the definition of me being pissed.
---
Just wait to see me after i slam my toe on the table's leg.
---
Sorry lol
---
wow its almost like they're inviting people for advertising instead of people to test stuff
---
I don't see why you're making it sound as if EU players are somehow worse in Vanilla than NA? Yeah we sort of got a later start to WoW but there's just as many good players here as in America. But usually NA *streamers* get to be more popular, but that's a streamer/twitch thing more than a WoW/Vanilla problem.
---
That warfront looks gorgeous ! I hope one day in Classic we can adopt some of their positive art works.
---
Invite friend, you log off, and he kicks you, should work.
---
That isnt true either. When Do they rotate people out like that? Bc that doesnt happen on stream bc I watch them both. And wtf do you mean by inactive? Im sure all the people that have beta are constantly playing, and beta is still new so how inactive can they be? They dont rotate people out of the guild or even worry about that because they usually have a streamer mob following them around to do high end shit at their lvl, like Gurubashi or Whirlwind axe.
---
Totally missed the point about all the people going alliance bc of CC's too, but okay you idiot.
---
I get streamers getting beta for views, but if you’re giving pokimane beta before MadSeason... you fucked up. Glad he’s finally in
---
Follow not working in bgs makes follow working in world pvp seem intentional.
---
You do understand that those BiS lists are exactly that, they are a specific combination that is "best". 
---
That does not mean that every item on that list is the best choice in every case irrespective of what other items you have equipped, the value of stats change based on how much of each stat you have. 
---
You also cannot assume that every character has access to those items at every stage; there are many items that will drop between where you are now and your best in slot combination, and even if you had lists of those items as well, it doesn't change the fact that you still cannot guarantee the comparative value of these items without knowing the other items that are equipped.
---
Leather working is a bit wonky. The end game leatherworking recipes are good, but require the farming of mats that are usually camped an example would be the devilsaur hides. 
---
Sticking with selling raw mats is usually a good bet for a steady flow of gold.
---
Engineering is indeed a benefit in pvp and can win you fights you would have otherwise lost. It is worth leveling, but can cost a bit of money to do so.
---
Precisely the type of guild I'm forming on horde side. Real life first, adult working schedule in mind, still clearing content with a good size roster and good and experienced leadership handling raids with calendar sign ups to check on everyone's availability, and not wasting everyone's precious free time spent in game.
---
This hardcore raiding mindset is a quick way to burn out of classic, something I am looking forwards to enjoying for a long time to come. People don't realize how much easier this game will be with the mmo experience many of us have picked up since... hell, even just with the amount of knowledge that's available online now.
---
when mind control breaks, does that not make the NPC attack the caster?
---
I did it once back in the day because it went past zones I'd never seen before and I wanted to see them.
---
Never did it again, though.
---
Its reddit dude nobody knows how this shit works
---
A lot more freekills, druids are horrible at anything but flag carrying.
---
Got'eeem
---
It's funny when people ask this, it was literally the most new player friendly time in wow.
---
Vanilla pserver consumable requirements weren't even necessary, just make fights quicker. Also, pservers were overtuned and more difficult than classic will be.
---
Or just not be a waste of a raidslot and be a healer with shadow weaving specced, using r1 mindblasts.
---
Only if you are a patient person. Classic/Vanilla rewards patience. It punishes people (big time) who get overly-ambitious.
---
Same. So much so. This video is etched into my memory. I still have it on my PC today as i downloaded it.
---
I don't know If I can explain this, but I'll try.
---
They take place at different points in time. 
---
The Retail version is how Darkshore looks after Cataclysm, and is how it looks currently for all leveling characters. Once you hit 120 you gain access to the warfront instead. 
---
According to the story Sylvanas took charge of the Horde and invaded Darkshore, and currently the Night Elves are fighting the Horde there. That's the setting for the warfront. Essentially it's an updated version of Darkshore, with new quests and content aimed at max-level characters. 
---
There's currently two zones that got the warfront treatment: Darkshore and Arathi highlands. Hopefully we'll get more as the expansion progresses, I really enjoy them so far and it gives the Blizzard Team a chance to revisit old zones and make them relevant again. Only problem is some of the writing surrounding them.
---
TBC was my jam back in the day. I am hoping that they bring those servers back. I would pay to transfer my classic hero to a TBC server.
---
12 Million people thought it was worth it, but it probably wont be for you.  /s
---
Finally! I can't stand the other content creators. Madseason is the best!
---
Yea by time we get to 60 and it matters to anyone APES guys and a thousand others will have been debating this.
---
Some one will make the arguments APES or not. 
---
And to be frank I don't want to hear about how we should have PvP day one lol. 
---
That worked so well on p servers.....lul. I do not trust their judgement on what is good for a server.
---
The list above isn't opinion. Warrior tanks being better isn't opinion.
---
I mean the big difference when I think about it is the silver cost most of all. In terms of actual time it’s not that bad.
---
Average player age in 2005 was 28. I was 25. It might seem like it was a mostly kids because you naturally gravitated towards each other.
---
Nice, multiboxers are aids for the game anyway.. Fucking useless and takes up X spots in BGs, putting the whole team at a disadvantage.
---
wowwiki.fandom.com is about 95% accurate with having the correct patch information on most items.  
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Schematic:_Thorium_Shells

There is no patch, so that would indicate 1.0.

Here is an example of a item that wasn't in 1.0.

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Schematic%3A_Hyper-Radiant_Flame_Reflector
---
How do procs for extra attacks like Hand of Justice work with dual-wielding? Are the extra attacks main-hand only, or just whichever attack swings next?
---
Because he's really bad at pvp but snutz is really really good
---
That is my goal
---
No argument about resist gear, but you for sure don't need a full suite of consumes for naxx. 
---
A step up from mc/bwl? Yes, absolutely. Things like felwood songflower buff? No, not at all.
---
Again, pservers are also overtuned from actual classic.
---
TA was added during the actual life of vanilla, not in the 2.0 prepatch. The reason nobody remembers it is because it was pretty much a non-entity. WF totem was the god totem, no raid was going to give up WF in a group for TA.
---
This will be fixed. You won't be able to fly to C if B is a required link.
---
WTB /WTT
---
I might be misremembering, but I recall the boats being significantly faster.
---
Opinion
---
I remember you could still get booted out of an instance back in vanilla by forming a party and getting yourself kicked out, so you could still do the trick as long as you had a friend online to regularly accept party invites.
---
No because snutz is really good. I'll probably play alliance.
---
I don’t think looking for a group for something 3 months away is going to work.
---
When we killed it in vanilla.  I think the only mod we had was like a distance check.
---
I told my wife about WoW classic and she said welp it was nice having a husband while it lasted! Jokes aside all things in moderation. With my current career and family I will be casual.
---
If you want some backstory play Warcraft 3 and it’s expansion to get some background on the story.
---
It’s not everything but it’s a very large chunk of the lore and a good setup.
---
Not to mention it’s really fun
---
This is me. Sitting in the highly devoleloped fleshed out version of wow looking jealous at everybody who has a beta key.
---
Oh you mean the grenades that are level 35, at lvl 30? GOTCHA
---
They wanted you guys to have the genuine experience. The Beta is no big deal. Join a Vanilla server and finalize your build for classic.
---
So virgins play horde and winners play alliance..got it
---
Hard facts
---
Reminds me of my old video I made just after getting my first mount. Just 1,5 minutes of me running around on my mount with "You raise me up" playing
---
Alliance are fucking horde pretty badly on beta rn. Esp in BGs
---
People have terrible fucking memory and vanilla players probably didn't do too much totem twisting to use tranq when they had WF.
---
Even in classic, rosters were usually 50+... 4-5 extras is likely not enough outside of the most dedicated guilds.
---
Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Oh you mean the level 35 grenades at lvl 30? GOTCHA
---
Was it really that high? Skill caps in vanilla were 300. +225 seems excessive.
---
I guess we'll see if any progression guilds use a Druid MT. The answer will be no.
---
Tauren is the worst choice for all his classes.
---
Where now is the horse and the rider ? :)
---
Have u tested it on the beta?
---
I wasn't on the forums much because I was too busy having giant group fights on the elemental plateau and SMV lol. Our servers must have been very different.
---
It was also not really remembered because you could never really use it in 5 mans, which was most of the content since it would hit your tank too doing absolutely nothing lol.
---
but it could be used in raids if you were in a caster group.
---
In certain combos which normally lack stuns, tauren are really solid.
---
Warrior + shaman comes to mind.
---
Shamans have no baseline stuns, warrior have intercept and warstomp does not DR with intercept.
---
So if you are happy to properly communicate like you would in arenas, you can warstomp for your shaman, he cleanses a poison or trinkets a warrior snare and is out of the clutch of melee range.
---
Same with caster, because your elemental shaman will be less likely to sit ontop of a WL, mage etc.
---
Stunning a mage so your shaman does not have to worry about eating a 10second nature lockout by counter spell is huge.
---
All in all the more skilled and communication happy you are with your buddy, the better tauren becomes.
---
In 1v1 orc is still better.
---
Were sockets part of classic? Like the extra blacksmithing and leather working armor slots or did that come later?
---
That's pretty slippery-slopey. Just because they get invited to test bugs doesn't mean they're suddenly going to be consulted for game changing design choices, lol.
---
This is just horrible tbh. And sorry but comments like this are the reason many people think bad about the gaming community
---
thanks a lot
---
Shamans would lay it down if they were in the caster or heal group. It's not nearly as good as paladins salvation, but it's something. The only other totem you'd lay in the heal group is probably mana stream, and these use different totem elements, air and water respectively.
---
If your friend doesn't remember it then he was probably a bad shaman. Take anything he says with a grain of salt.
---
"Rolls NE Priest" picture of a UD Rogue o.O
---
What makes you say that?
---
Someone should have told daenarys that
---
To be fair, Blizzard games are just casual versions of an original inspiration (TF2, League, Everquest)
---
Used to work on live or pserver?
---
the mob armor values and spawn rates are different so it's a totally different game xddd
---
Can test synergy on private servers. That's what I'm doing now.
---
Mained a mage back in Vanilla-WOTLK before switching to Hunter for the following expansions, so I’ll probably go back to a mage.
---
That being said, warlock is (sort of) an in-between and has piqued my interest, so may main a lock...
---
Obviously I won’t decide until a few hours in with each lol.
---
I’ll test it. The big issue is the time on the long flight path can be used for personal time. I.E. Check a guide. Use the bathroom. Talk to a friend/family member. It’s a break time so to speak. With the boats you have to actually be present.
---
Seriously sell these. I would buy in a heartbeat
---
There's already 6 or more from APES on beta, isn't that enough for you?
---
1.13 patch???
---
Pvp Undead, PVE Troll
---
Maybe also add like a 3-4sec cast time to flying mounts.  And make it magic based so that it can be interrupted as well.
---
Strongly disagree. Not saying it's necessarily better, but retail is far more accessible than classic. How is classic the most new player friendly time?
---
Very few people have ever gone out into the world looking exclusively to kill members of the other faction. 95% of encounters were two people who were in the world for other purposes who happen upon eachother and fight.
---
If not for BGs, once casual players had gotten their blue dungeon gear, and were on a weekly clear of MC/ZG/Ony had very little reason to be logged in. BGs were that reason. The Economics of vanilla wow dont support multiple years of farming the worlds resources for casual players--with or without bgs, EPL, WS, Felwood, Silithus, Burning Steppes wouldve been the ghost towns they were for the majority of 2006 (Silithus excluded thanks to AQ). 
---
Not having a consistent stream of good gear from crafting necessitating constant farming throughout the expansion leads to the death of wpvp. Not BGs. 
---
WoW dies before Wrath and certainly before Cata without  BGs and Arena.
---
I’d buy one. Looks really cool. Hits me in the feels for some reason.
---
They're _pretty_ hardcore, even for MMO players.
---
I don't know if this specific story is true, but it wouldn't surprise me.
---
Ahh the good ole days of 40man Deadmines
---
What? Follow will always be in world, irregardless of pvp happening or not.
---
Can you imagine it holding the weight of a Tauren... Those gryphons will end up in therapy.
---
You....you want a shitty camera bug that is annoying and sounds awful... strictly because #nochanges? Holy shit this subreddit is cancer.
---
so glad these kind of people won't play also glad streamers will also go away after first few weeks as the game will slowly be reduced to a smaller community that is dedicated.
---
&gt; along with the 41 point trees as we got them the patch before BC and because of the level 60 restriction they were decently well balanced even pre-BC.
---
I cannot agree with this, though. Mutilate was absurdly imbalanced. 2.8k crits totally possible, where my mage had like 3.6 and you could do 2 mutilates instantly if you waited for the energy tick.
---
The BC talents were never really balanced for Vanilla. Although I did freaking love Dragon's Breath. The talent single handedly tipped the scale in mage vs shaman for me, because the instant unblockable CC enabled me to clear out grounding totem and get a Fireball off without being earth shocked. That felt SOOOO GOOOD
---
"i check my launcher..."
---
*old WoW login screen music*
---
"oh yes.."
---
So I never played Vanilla WoW but I have been consistently playing since WotLK and my brother started playing at launch. I’m not sure what class I want to play and am not 100% sure how viable classes or specs were in Vanilla. 
---
My three mains I wanted in for Classic  are;
---
1: Priest, I mained a priest in MoP and start of WoD and it was fun. I’ve heard they were a great healing class but how do they compare to say Rduid or Rsham? (I play horde btw) are they as needed as everyone says they are? Or am I just as likely to get in a raid as the others?
---
2: Mage or Lock, I’ve always liked a solid RDPS class. In what situations would you choose one over the other for raiding or PVP, and how do the classes play out in Classic?
---
3: A solid PVP class, I was thinking rogue because I’ve never had a rogue main. But I’m not against a Druid or warrior either. What’s best for world PVP and then other BGS? What have other played and had a fun tome leveling and end game content? 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Kevin Jordan, John Staats and Mark Kern have given interviews on webshows and podcasts. Check out Countdowntoclassic, Classicast, wowhead articles and reddit AMAs from the last 18 months.
---
Hmm there was a recemt thread on /r/wow discussing how this was overstated and that the difference was minimal.
---
"do not take being told WE SUCK per capita relative to scandis or germans"
---
I'm gonna assume you're not a native english speaker? Or switched up some words in your response?
---
I said literally the opposite.
---
Holy shit thank you so much for the in depth explanation. Sounds like an interesting feature.
---
&gt; You can always buy cheap potions of a guildmate 
---
Not if everyone is rolling engineering.
---
The predicament is the same. Locked into a faction that's not the preferred one. Hence why I hope that his friends are more budging than mine.
---
Cheers though!
---
Launcher usually updates instantly, while the e-mail has been reported to take up to several hours to arrive.
---
The amount of things to do and learn in retail is absurd. There needs to be a reset on retail because it’s gone on far too long. Too many classes, professions, activities, etc 
---
Classic is simple. The grind is longer, but it’s so much simpler
---
The John Staats book is definately worth the money and will be/is on Amazon. Much more storytelling and great anecdotes. He actually wrote the diary during development so it is a unique piece of history.
---
Noone's gonna make a devilsaur mafia if the respawn is way longer than on pservers. It couldn't possibly be profitable under those circumstances. The whole reason a mafia formed around it was the fact that the respawns were a) completely deterministic and b) pretty quick, so you could farm for a couple of hours and come away with like a full stack of devilsaur leather.
---
Yea good luck finding players that want to play with someone that breaks the ToS.
---
From what I understand, enhancement shamans have can have a place in raids. Some guilds bring one for the improved windfury totem and the Nightfall debuff. In pvp, ele/resto hybrid spec is suuuper good in BGs and wpvp. You have tools to beat every class 1v1. In BGs your ele burst is crucial for finishing off kills and you give a ton of offensive utility with totems and purging off enemy buffs.
---
There is gear that has reflect damage, but the absolute best pieces are related to blocking.  So the only class that can do a full reflect build is generally prot paladin.  Even then it is a meme spec, only useful for dueling rogues or farming lower level dungeons.  
---
For paladins, obviously they can get buffed with thorns by a druid, then:
---
Razer Gauntlets:  Plate 3 arcane reflect
---
Nagelring:  Ring 3 arcane reflect
---
Ret aura 20 reflect,
---
Thorium shield spike, 25 reflect on block
---
Blessing of Sanctuary, 35 holy damage on block
---
Holy shield:  120 reflect on block
---
cloak of flames: 5 fire reflect
---
essence of pure flame:trinket with 13 fire reflect
---
It’s disabled in world pvp on retail, which is what classic is built on.
---
Sockets came in TBC and blacksmithing in Wrath I think
---
Yeah StaySafe is garbage
---
You would need an active sub, however Blizzard made a post saying they’re pretty much done giving out Betas so your chance of getting one is slim to none. I wouldn’t sub unless you want to play BFA until classic comes out
---
It's really great. Battle of Azeroth might have a lot of flaws, but the art department isn't one of them. The new zones are beyond gorgeous.
---
Wow the lighting and shadows need a look in the flag room.
---
They were probably using arcane shot/serpent sting. Aimed shot/multi shot are the only spells hunters need to be casting in most raid fights, does the most damage per mana and they can usually last the entire fight. Even if they go oom auto attack damage is still quite high
---
Shaman is always the least played class despite what polls might indicate. When rubber meets the road hybrids suffer the most.
---
You’re not going to get a beta invite so don’t worry.
---
Invites wont be happen til tomrrow so you can just sleep\^\^
---
Gotcha thanks for the info, trying to decide which way to go in classic.
---
1. Pve u will go Frost for the first raids, aq and naxx u Go fire specc.
---
PvP i prefer mainly Frost for survivability and kiting, u could also do the ap  pom pyro pog yolo oneshot Specc.
---
Totem management is not so easy in pvp
---
Yeah but I’m delusional so I’m still holding out hope
---
Thanks brah
---
There wont be anymore closed beta invites and stress test is over. you can read about it here:  [https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=179883&amp;region=us](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=179883&amp;region=us)
---
Oh have they announced more invites get sent tomorrow?
---
Yikes
---
The leveling experience in retail is much simpler and more streamlined than in classic. Quests are clearly marked on your map, relevant items appear on the quest list, there's a lot less downtime and a lot less tedium. Hunters don't have to worry about ammo, other classes don't have to worry about buying/gathering items to use certain abilities, constantly going into a city to learn ranks of spells, leveling up weapon skills by mindlessly attacking mobs, having to run everywhere and likely not be able to afford a mount at level 40...the list goes on.
---
Sure, end-game in classic was a lot less bloated but for a new player they won't even get there until 12ish+ days played, and some of that time is spent grinding because the quest design was awful.
---
Well you shouldn’t because you’re not going to get an invite. They have all the testers they need.
---
ty for the reply!
---
Mine took several days to arrive
---
Cool man
---
Thank you to all of you! Never been around the WoW community but i appreciate all the nice responses. I will definitely just wait till august.
---
Only the classicwow subreddit values The Big Short memes. I knew I found my community.
---
A lot of those people who say that about racials are “hardcore” minmaxers on private servers who overvalue racials. For rogues, the weapon skill is like a 1.8% DPS increase for swords, and for warriors it’s slightly higher. Nobody except for cutting edge speedrunning guilds have a valid reason to deny someone solely because of their race. What I always tell people is “the loss of happiness that you get from having to look at your character that you cherish and realize it’s not the race you wanted to be because of some stupid forum jockies compelling you to do so because of some minimal impact racials is a bigger detriment than any dps loss from not having said racial.” The only impactful racial that is a notable exception is Fear Ward, and even then you shouldn’t be joining guilds where the raid lead denies you raid spots just because you’re not a dwarf priest because that’s just gonna lead to a bad time.
---
&gt; I hope one day in Classic we can adopt some of their positive art works
---
The #nochanges crowd would start riots in the streets.
---
Try to avoid people though just in case you get a girlfriend!!
---
I'd like to piggyback on this post. Playing Bfa (and legion and even some earlier exps) stresses me out so much. I feel like I HAVE to do things every day or every week or I will be behind. 
---
In classic that doesn't happen to me. Can't play today but can play a lot in a few days? No worries! :)
---
&gt;  incredibly viable
---
That's a stretch, shamans are healers that use interrupts and  occasionally burst/kite. Priests are heal/shield/dispel all game and to that end Disc is more powerful. None of these 2 specs are in the pre-made meta.
---
I would give anything to experience classic with no wow experience. You should try it out, especially if you have some friends willing to play with you and ESPECIALLY if they plan on making tbc/wrath servers later on.
---
You say /s but what does holy bring that you can’t pick up alongside repentance?
---
You can pick up the knockback and CC reduction and Holy spell potency all alongside repentance. You lose holy shock, but in PVP CC is king.
---
Cringe.
---
There's no restriction to having multiple factions mounts.
---
But getting the rep at lv40 for troll, and then getting the rep for undead, I'd recon is not possible. There just isn't enough quests to get that much rep.
---
Sounds like you should roll PVE - PVP servers are going to be a bloodbath...
---
Dwarf Hunter just like my original character in 2004.  
---
Nothing screams 'Murica more than a drunken short fat man with a beard waving a rifle around with his pet dog/wolf beside him.
---
I lucked out. My one buddy loves ally and is ally at heart. I was gonna roll ally with him (otherwise horde) turns out everyone we know is rolling horde (other than him). We’re going horde now.
---
I guess it's current (from 2018 Blizzcon) Vanilla patch.  
---
Which would also allow database websites to add "1.13" in description... for some reason. Which most likely confused me.
---
It depends. If you like really slow gameplay with strong sense of community, then Classic is good choice. If you want rather play more solo with option of group content, story development and future progression then current WoW is better for you.
---
Nah, my friend and I are going to attack every single Alliance player we see while we level.
---
If you don't want to get ganked maybe you shouldn't have picked the wrong faction :)
---
I would say hunter or druid has the highest skill ceiling, possibly warrior too. Shaman is not one that comes to mind as the "highest". The difference between a good player and a bad player is incredibly obvious in the first 3 classes I mentioned, a bad shaman can still perform decently in pvp
---
No but, there are none in sunday.
---
They ruined the last big server because they didnt' want to be bored so we had day one honor. 
---
Crushed the pvp scene. 
---
Had to simultaneously race to MC and build a bank for that, while building a pvp bank as you're farming honor. 
---
Was insanely stupid. And I blame APES for that. 
---
Beyond that I trust their opinion over just about anyone elses from a guild/group perspective. WHich is why they're dangerous lol
---
If you're gonna listen to anyone as a dev, you would be sane to choose them first. There are no equivalent NA guilds. We have players at teh ceiling...But guilds who can field 15/20 dudes near the ceiling holistically. PvE and PvE. Surprisingly rare even on a server with 10k people on. 
---
Problem is your base PvP is only 10 man. Your base raid is 40 man. So there is awlays mismatch on gear and incentives to split PvPers up to maximize loot. Rare to congregate in one guild, I would not want to share PvP drops with other PvP paladins, much better to be in a guild where I'm the only one who cares about the plate with int/stam/mp5 on it.
---
I'm with you Heatbeat, looks like fucking Michael Jackson moonwalking across the desert.
---
Tomorrow is memorial day, and there probably wont be a closed beta wave for awhile. Even all the friends and family arent in yet.
---
https://discord.gg/rjkJhcq is a good place to start. 
---
For min maxing, troll in pve and either for PvP. Engineering is a must, and for pve tailoring until you make the robe of the archimage.
---
I'm not too sure on streamers.
---
It's better to have another pure dps class than wf for 4 melee + 1 shaman.
---
Not really viable until ZG.
---
Oh shit there is? Sad lol. Another day to waste :-(
---
Only if you wish to play both sides on the same server or you plan on playing twinks and need to be able to run yourself or protect yourself while farming AGM/fishing hat.
---
SW is better if you are leveling around SW (duh)  
---
IF is better when raiding starts since it's closer to MC and BWL.
---
Just right click on my portrait and click follow
---
Probably not! Classic wow is running on a modern client, not the old one.
---
Classic has lots of casual content for you.  Prebis gearing you can do solo, and is pretty good. If you wanna PVP, you can casually hit rank 10 and get the full blue set (which is usually good for most classes). The easy raids you can pug or do with a casual guild. The only content you really need to be in a more organized serious guild or group is for rank 14 grinding, and for BWL, AQ40, and Naxx. Everything else is puggable or doable in a casual guild.
---
Often the kids were actually the ones who were less toxic
---
For me it was Cata that did me in.  Left mid Cata, tried coming back twice during late MoP and during Legion launch, but the game still sucked.
---
Can always get them from the auction house.
---
Mutilate was only that good at 70. At 60 it was good but not Prep/Cold Blood/Hemo stunlock build good.
---
Did you even read my post? I literally said in my post that healing is preferred in premades for both of those classes.
---
I’ve never been able to choose that talent
---
RemindMe! 95 days
---
39’s will be the most happening from what I am hearing.  I have played 19, 24, 29, 39, and 109, and all my friends are saying they will main twink 39’s.
---
#I WANNA DO EVERYTHING
---
Ah lol is staysafe that bad?
---
I leveled as prot in vanilla and don’t remember it being that bad. You kill slowly but there is much less downtime and getting ads isn’t a big deal.
---
That Joanna lady did it in 4 days 20 hours play time. So if you played everyday for almost the entire day and slept for 7 hours or so its possible. However that is unrealistic for most I agree. I am booking a week off to go as hard as I possibly can and even if it takes me a week and a half its definitely doable. I have already organized a leveling route/quests to look for for gear and plans afterwards. I am taking this fairly serious in terms of focus and commitment haha.
---
More booze in IF as well.
---
Too bad. Guess I will play a rogue then like I initially planned to
---
I'm not. They bought GM services and gold on the servers they played on. Do a bit of research.
---
This is light RPing for people on forums, in game people are a lot kinder in my experience. You don't want to gank the first person you see, you never know if they're the type to stop leveling for the next 2 hours just to gank and corpse camp you. 
---
I don't kill greys either because they don't give any honor. I feel like I'm just wasting their time and mine.
---
Lmao alright bud
---
Apes was previously GRIZZLY
---
No. War doesn’t need a cause. You’re the enemy, you’re going to die.
---
Well i took 3 weeks off. So there's that.
---
every streamer being alliance doesn't really mean much (I'm assuming you want to play with them) unless you're on their server or you randomly come across them in a BG (unlikely since they'll be premade)
---
Don't worry they wont.
---
Yeah scratch what I said. From your last paragraph you could get two meanings out of it, wasn't sure if you personally are NA or EU, haha. 
---
Either way, we're all in this together. It's just a fact that there's more NA streamers per any game than EU, thus most of the people who got invited into this beta are in fact, Americans.
---
Or you just get rid of them entirely, the only benefit of having them was convenience and they come with many downsides that it's just not worth having them in any iteration.
---
93 i believe
---
Exaclty! we were used to download them instead of watching youtube!
---
1. Priests are gold and always wanted in raids for healing, definitely more so than druids and shamans. If you want to raid as shadow you'll have a tough time getting a spot but they are incredible in pvp.
---
2. Can't go wrong with either mage or lock. There will be a lot of mages, likely the most populated class, but you always want a lot of them so it works out. Warlocks are far less popular but also desired so it kind of comes down to preference. Either way the pve rotation is going to be a bit bland so maybe think about what style you prefer in pvp if that helps?
---
3. Rogues are another solid choice but there are also quite a few in pvp. You get to choose your battles. Druid and warrior are definitely a lot more difficult to play in pvp since they are at a bit of a disadvantage a lot of the time, but if you play them well it's extremely rewarding and well worth it. Imo they'd be more fun to play, especially druid.
---
But you probably want to stick to just a couple of classes. It'll be hard to level 3 and keep them relevant to have for each scenario. Shadow priest and lock are easily the top two in pvp further down the line with mage up pretty close. So if you want to pvp it's possible to stick with one of those but remember there is no dual talent specialization and respeccing costs a lot so you have to commit to it
---
You don't need a reason to PVP in this game. They're the competition, they're the enemy, that's enough.
---
PVP server means PVP. It’s fair game. That’s the point.
---
Priest has the best raw healing of any healer, with paladin close behind. Druids and shamans have less healing but more group utility with things like combat res, innervate, windfury totems ECT.
---
“...the amount of closed beta invites that we’re sending out is rapidly decreasing...” 
---
Does not mean no more invites. 
---
There’s another stress test next week. While last stress test members are auto included in the upcoming one, I’ve not seen any info on if any new invites will be sent out.
---
[Ser Nutter](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/0d/8d/eb0d8d9262228112183705377cce335c.jpg)
---
Don't play on a pvp server if you don't want unprompted pvp. 
---
PvE/RP servers allow people to flag themselves if they would like to participate in pvp. 
---
There's already a system in place on these to address your issues; just roll on one of them.
---
With the guides and streams proliferating there's a good chance most crafting professions except engineering will be under-represented until enough hardcore guys level alts to craft.
---
Thank you for your respond! Really appreciated
---
It's even stranger depending on your weapon type. His little paw comes up and blocks your giant mace 20 times his little weight. Lol.
---
tauren is way better shaman. Those warstomps are great on some boss fitghts, like nef,  and in pvp. 
---
why would you even want to be an orc shaman? stun resist?
---
I agree with you.  I never really got the point of killing people that cant fight back.  Im all for some good open world scrapping against similar levels.  But just smacking someone utterly beneath you for the sake of it is kind of pathetic imo.  Obviously theres exceptions to this, for example someone camping your friend and you show up to remove them from existance, but in most cases its just toxic.
---
i would love to have this as a shower curtain
---
im gonna enjoy corpse camping ppl like this :) cya on classic!
---
Actually priest is #4 for Horde and shaman is #1 (according to the poll).
---
Thank you! Really appreciated! 
---
What about alliance? Gnom bis for Pve and PVP ( espace artist)
---
how does this shit get upvoted?
---
You could literally twoshot squishies in an instant from stealth. That's all every PvP Rogue ever did when that Patch hit. Maybe it wasn't the best spec but it was utterly broken and 0 fun to go up against.
---
The double Mutilate burst doesn't even factor in the Evis you could cast 4 seconds later. Or hell, just vanish and regen. It was utterly broken.
---
I'm personally practicing some leveling routes and trying some different classes. I wouldn't accept gold/bags from people since that's not what a new server would be like, especially with bags/random greens being much more rare on classic compared to p servers
---
Does not look fun from The mage perspektiv. Spam 1 for 10 minutes
---
tl;dr   
---
Someone chosing horde over alliance is enough cause to kill them.
---
I'm on the same boat, because of this I'm most likely going to roll on a PVE server as that will save me a lot of time. I do enjoy PvP but I'll simply just have to wait for BGs to come out. I think if you play on a PvE server it's very doable for a casual, you can take your time and if you run into players with higher gear you never have to worry about getting ganked and when you feel ready you can start joining battlegrounds. Oh and lastly, I don't go into discord unless I'm raiding.
---
Classic offers much less content for casual player than current WoW and it will most likely to start annoy you very soon but you can always switch to current WoW.
---
go back to retail and turn on carebear mode
---
tl;dr idk i'm not reading that.
---
If you assume 50:50 faction distribution between classes, then paladin is #4 with 12.5%
---
"my fellow Americans"
---
IDk why you're tlakiong about streamers and the beta
---
Has nothing to do with who is good
---
It means the only invites sent out will be Friends &amp; Family.
---
Rogue... or warrior. Can't really make up my mind 😕
---
&gt; No. War doesn’t need a cause. You’re the enemy, you’re going to die.
---
Technically you aren't at war. You are in a time of uneasy peace due to a ceasefire agreement.
---
Yeah, I'm embarrassed by how edgy and awkward I was throughout the Classic through Cataclysm time I played, and several years after
---
no wait only kill
---
Only need a few tanks. Need tons of DPS warriors and rogues
---
it should be fairly easy to make an addon that lists people who want to be able to switch layer from layer to layer
---
Wasn't the only broken thing then. And I'd take that if it's the price of more specs all round being viable, which as you said is o e thing BC talents did a lot better.
---
1. For PVE you start out by going either winters chill or arcane. You only need 1 winter chill mage in your raid rest arcane, so here's the arcane spec:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oi0VcofquZVA0c0r
---
In AQ/naxx you go fire, but you can find a spec for that later.
---
In PVP there's 2 main specs. Deep frost and elemental. Deep frost is tanky with shield, elemental is high damage with instant aoe spells. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzf0uZV0GhRbth
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0Ab0bZZViGhRbtbo
---
2. For PVE troll is better of course. For PVP undead is better. If you plan on doing any kind of pvp, then I recommend going undead, I think pvp racials are a lot more important than small dps increase in raids.
---
3. Professions: Definitely go engineering. It's just amazing in too many ways. For 2ndary you generally pick a gold making profession, but you do need tailoring at some points in the game. The way I did it: Start with tailoring 300, and get the archmage chest. Then unlearn tailoring and learn either mining skinning or herbalism. There's a few ways to make money as a mage, and they all include one or more of these professions. For example DME farming is great with herbalism, devilsaur and DMN is great with skinning, and BRD AoE is great with mining. You can also just herb in the world that is solid too.
---
4. Mage pvp streamers you are in luck:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/norththemage Solid mage previously r13.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/kraunx Apes mage currently playing in BETA
---
https://www.twitch.tv/og_jeffery Great fun pvper who just got beta access with endless of low lvl mage pvp experience
---
https://www.twitch.tv/steezyswag Big undead mage streamer on beta.
---
Can we now agree that having a 16 debuff slots in the beginning is not a great idea? I remember commenting about my disagreement with it here about half a year ago and got something like 30 downvotes. People were mad, asking if I don't want certain classes to be relevant which is a pretty dumb argument considering it's vanilla. Bosses were tuned to being beat with a limited number of debuff slots. If 16 are available right off the bat, the beginning content will be more of a faceroll
---
&gt; Using that logic, this poll would indicate that we can expect more Shamans than Warriors on Horde (2080/2 &lt; 1068). 
---
The result certainly indicates that.
---
Looks great. The "ease of leveling" scale is a bit odd since no class other than warrior drops below 5. I understand warrior is the most time consuming to level, but that feels a bit exaggerated.
---
Agreed. Earning rep for one near 40 could be done with strategic planning of quests.
---
Then to get Undead even at 60 may not be possible until runecloth repeatable quests are in place.
---
They do great dps.
---
I didn't call you anything, nor did I say you were "the bad guy", but okay.
---
I hope they chance the beta to require an active twitch stream to play it.
---
If you are on a PvP server don't cry about red = dead. Don't like it? Roll on a PvE server.
---
This has been my take when I first played in 2004 and my take now. Getting ganked, camped, etc is all shitty but that's the aspect that for some people including myself is part of what makes a PvP server great. The ever looming threat of your questing and farming turning into a complete bloodbath.
---
Again... PvE server if you dislike it.
---
The only benefit is not convenience. Im convinced that pretty much anyone would agree that is straightforwardly wrong. Flying mounts look awesome, and you feel impressive on them. They make a fantastic reward, a carrot and a way of making the player feel progression. Locations and secrets in game accessible only through flying are also cool and assist progression, depending on how flying is attained (in general or in these places). Stuff like Blades Edge, Storm peaks, Bastion of Twilight, Throne of the Four Winds. I feel like im in a fantasy world when i go to those places and thats fantastic for a fantasy RPG
---
What is amusing to me is, that I didn't even consider the innuendo when I made the image. Bent Staff is just what an UD mage starts out with, and the Executor Staff is the first staff quest reward you'll get.
---
What’s the bug?
---
Full of colors*
---
Night Elf starter zone for me. I will be running my dwarf there lvl 1
---
Agreed. All my friends hated it so I typically wouldnt level with them until we met up in Redridge or Duskwood. And I was always higher level because of all the great quests I did in Darkshore vs them scrapping for experience in Westfall.
---
No changes only applies to Classic in order to maintain the essence of "Vanilla" and what made the game so great. If hypothetically we were to get TBC &amp; WOTLK servers a few years down the line then there should absolutely be changes in order to give those expansions the vanilla feel that we all love. 
---
An example of these changes could be removing flying from BC and perhaps removing bosses like Magtheridon or Grul from their raid instances and making them a world boss that spawns once a week so that guilds can battle over them and create the epic mass scale war events that we see with Azuregos and the emerald drakes. 
---
For WOTLK it would be removing LFG, removing badge gear, and make the raids/dungeons much much harder than they were.
---
Gotta keep you on your toes.
---
lol "toxicity".... go back to Resetera. But real talk, play on a PVE server because If I see an orc or troll i'm shooting on site. I would hope they do the same. I'm excited for the bloodshed in Stranglethorn. I do think that killing grays is a waste of time though.
---
I've found in the private server I play on, FP players are not "targetable" for spells. Likewise for those mounted on a flight as well.
---
But then again you had threat and rage/mana to manage.
---
I realize I worded that real dumb.  I am running WoW on a new (\~2017) laptop.  My bad.
---
Yep! That was a sad day. Before that I found almost all the players I raided with, and also later gilded with, from joining together for dungeons first. That destroyed the game's sense of community.
---
that's pretty much my entire reason for wanting to play Priest in Classic. plus, i find Druid healing in Classic kind of boring.
---
Is perhaps a bug? But if it is I would like this bug implemented, as it would be a real shame that a 60 flying over some lvl 12 in barrens drop a dot on them as they speed right past.
---
So you say it is a bug in official server?
---
When HoJ procs, no matter which weapon triggers it, a main hand attack is performed and the swing timer for the main hand is reset as if it had just swung normally.
---
some kind of pvp morality activist huh? Remember the dangers of getting one too many vaccines kids
---
my plan will be to level up alts with rested, get them to level 35 and get enough to make Mooncloth / Arcanite bars on CD. Best choise would be Warlock, because you can place them as well in strategic locations for summons / world bosses as well. On Main, 1st profession would be Engineering, its a must because of several BoP items and required (engi). 2nd either herbalism or mining for consistent gold, backup for engineering / potions.
---
Will be PGY-2 once classic drops, RIP my patients
---
Maybe a bug in pservers. But if it keeps flighted players separate from ground players in terms of PvP/ganking, then I'm all for it. I despise griefing/ganking and am more for even combat as it's more fair and establishes a superior player, so it should stay as unable to combat them.
---
When was your account created?
---
Oh trust me, I will
---
model swap :)
---
I believe the only pet that said any lines was the succubus
---
All of us played classic with no WoW experience and most of us found it a worthy experience.
---
You’ll probs be okay if you play on the Classic graphic settings instead of high or ultra.
---
We always rolled horde but dwarf is hands down my favourite alliance race
---
If I see you in game, and I mean YOU specifically, you’re now doubly dead.  The enemy faction is just that, an enemy faction.  If you don’t want to PVP don’t play on a PVP server.  It’s that simple.  You wrote a novel basically begging for it.
---
Kind of the opposite of what people are talking about. Playing two hours a day with your play style would mean hitting 60 after one year (with one week off). 
---
Casuals wanting to experience end game content will probably aim for playing efficiently, putting in less hours in total.
---
Another one of these???
---
Other way around I think you meant? Lvl 12 flying over a 60, who drops a dot on the lvl 12.
---
I'll be honest keep the slimy &amp; fun killing social paladin ideologies away from wow pls, this game existed at a time before all that
---
2004. This is the first beta I didn't get in to. I guess my /roll came up with a 1.
---
One's an MMO and the other is Diablo. Especially with the player base of Classic being the way that they are, I really don't think that they'd be okay with blizzard implementing systems from Diablo and Hearthstone into WOW. They'd definitely be warmer to vanilla like content or TBC without flying or what not.
---
Probably a 60 on a PvP server flying over barrens looking for easy kills without touching the ground.
---
Classic...
---
Best of luck to you and your wife leveling up. Hopefully y'all could squash in life differences with in-game duels. I am looking forward mostly to level up with new groups of friends hopefully it will be a welcoming community and not just goal oriented/driven type A people. I understand the excitement of having all the achievements or completing every quest/raid getting the highest still the quickest in one profession. Nonetheless that style of gaming is not for me, it wasn't before and it won't be now. Lol I guess I'm a casual but I simply enjoy the camaraderie that such a game can create and not so much for the loot and achievements. If I'd want that, I'd simply go grind battlefront.
---
Oh sorry :(
---
I check this subreddit almost 5-6 times at day and didn't see any poll like this :(
---
To give my 2 cents, I find it annoying to see "just chatting streamers" getting into the beta.  
---
1. I am 100% sure none of them had an active sub, which is clearly stated in blue posts a must have to be invited.
---
2. They have next to zero hours on world of warcraft on their twitch channel, which also could mean they most likely never played, maybe off stream or a long time ago, but I doubt it.
---
3. Yes, they are streamers/content creators, but I can assure you all. They will only log in once or twice and never touch the beta again. Beta is for testing, not for expanding your channel and influx.
---
4. I know people which has been subbed for 10 - 13 years and not gotten an invite. While others that started in Cata and onwards.
---
This is literally how Hitler survived for so long. Just "minding his own business" in the Desolace. Obviously Alliance.
---
stop talking shit idiot, he has more binds than you have iq
---
Hey NA guys, thats Ragnaros-EU, the infamous Ragnaros-US launch during tbc, so dont hate pls :)
---
The only thing is it would never actually be that dark unless there was no moon or the stars were covered by clouds. I'm not sure where this whole pitch black thing came from but seeing as there's always a full moon in WoW and there is no light pollution like we have in cities it would be quite bright.
---
I actually live out in the middle of nowhere and on full moon nights its stupid bright outside.
---
You only need to go tailoring until you make your Robe of the Void then you can drop it and still use the robe
---
They're typically paired because of the convenience
---
if you plan on pvping, you need engineering.
---
In this particular case they definitely did not.
---
Oh no you're right, BFA nights, are quite similar to classic nights. This post is just bullshit by somebody who wanted to piss on retail without doing any research.
---
Rotations aren’t really a thing. Yea some abilities have synergy or a priority level, but it doesn’t feel forced like in BfA. Theres more situational abilities you may have to use that will throw a set rotation off.
---
This is so dope
---
I was originally planning on re-rolling Horde this time around, but I decided against it. I really like the Alliance capital cities (IF, SW) way more than the Horde ones (specifically Orgrimmar).
---
Naw there were a lot of #trump2020s from those people in there too. Definitely not talking about the guild
---
Won't they need tailoring again for bloodvine or w.e though
---
you need it to get the 2% crit set bonus from ZG
---
Everything you just stated (immersion, RPG aspect, locations\secrets, carrot on a stick rewards, feeling of progression etc) are all more than achievable and were achieved in every aspect of Vanilla with only ground mounts being available. 
---
There's nothing but negatives that come with flying unless you've got limited time to put into the game and don't want to spend time running on the ground, being ganked, having to bypass groups of the opposing faction who have locked down an area etc  which was the same mindset that ruined the game when blizz started catering the game to people who want to put in the minimal time/effort.
---
I used the whole context of the argument i had with the other guy, on you. My bad.
---
Its DM and everyone even claiming its VC is a gigantic troll.
---
It existed before Dire Maul was even in game.
---
Noone called a dungeon by its endboss or breadcrumb ever.
---
Theres no sane logic behind that, everyone using it unironically has absolutely no clue and will die a terrible death.
---
Grizzly is NA, and much worse players
---
Source: NA player on the private scene who is much better than your average grizzly pleb
---
I haven't seen any evidence that being possible. I think you get pacified/stunned during the flight, so you cant take any actions.
---
 its DM and everyone even claiming its VC is a gigantic troll.   
---
 It existed before Dire Maul was even in game.   
---
 Noone called a dungeon by its endboss or breadcrumb ever.   
---
Got into the beta days before the email came
---
''That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we’re sending out is rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for testing. We’ll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.'' 
---
Dafuq are you on about, there's nothing in there that said they are doing friends and family only.
---
Horde/Undead. Always played like that in Vanilla and will play like that in Classic. I really dislike the aesthetics of every single other race with the exception of Orcs which I would probably roll with if I ever played a Warrior which I never do.
---
its DM. if you are looking for members to Dire Maul, you search for instance + wing. so there is never any confusion.
---
Clearly its DM for Deadmines.
---
DM:North DM:East and DM:West for Diremaul.
---
Diremaul was added later than Deadmines, so by right it was first. VC was only used by some to get people for the quest, but most IQ people used the quest name or said Vancleef.
---
Not true. Here's a solid example of pvp as a vanilla Druid: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q
---
Mine too! I was a full time raider that pvped (bgs and world on a pve server) anytime I could. It was the best.
---
I guess I'm just shocked at the overall direction this community wants to go in after classic is exhausted.
---
All I'm saying is if you can buff midflight, why not dot? Or instacast? I just want it to be not allowed so there's nothing to worry about flying, PvP, ect, all that
---
This is somehow more cringeworthy than the OP.
---
Not enough Grateful Dead references on reddit IMO
---
always Alliance.
---
Yes once ZG comes out you need to relevel tailoring. Luckily with ZG coming out you don't need a 2nd profession anymore as you can AOE farm the crocs.
---
Vc was one of my favorite dungeons
---
I doubt they'll be many people who not only hit 60 but also have the time to get a third or halfway there again with an alt before the rush of tourists ends and layering is switched off.
---
Yeah that sucks. Oh well, circlejerk is strong in this sub.
---
And yet we find that all of those are false reports.  Funny.
---
The music in this was so epic
---
People who are playing Beta. Is this poll somewhat accurate?
---
My complaint is who gives a fuck if it’s global just so everyone’s 12 instead of this midday bullshit. If you request the time off you’re losing half a day off not playing. I could give 0 fucks who plays first. Mid evening and 4 am is just stupid.
---
I'm going to murder some horde.
---
what you don't like vaccines jokes?
---
I really disliked Orgrimmar even though I only play Horde. I always enjoyed stealthing around the Alliance capital cities just to look around mainly.
---
I was one of those weirdos that would hang around Undercity for peace and quiet while crafting and such.
---
How does one get invited to friends and family?
---
I feel pressured to use engineering for PvP, but I want to take alchemy and Tailoring and then having a gathering character
---
I feel the same.
---
mine is General Drakkisath. GD
---
Discussion is what's important. Upvotes are just a hivemind indicator and should be ignored. The only healthy communities on reddit are the ones with vote counts hidden.
---
Did not know they made a classic version!
---
It doesn’t suggest that. It suggests that it’s the main thrust of different possible appeals otherwise primary would not be required a qualifier. 
---
But we get it dude. You are totally immune to nostalgia. Your unbroken devotion to WoW means time and memory have ceased to be concepts that you trade in. This is a trait worth defending somehow?
---
To add to this: even Kripp who used to be a famous WoW player said he has no interest in playing the beta, even though he has access. Seems like some were given access based on nothing else than being streamers.
---
...you know PvE servers exist, right?
---
Seeing Iron Forge for the very first time. The feeling I had, when I walked through those giant doors, was incredible.
---
Not to mention Mount Hyjall and Archimonde's bones hanging there. That made me so happy, as I've played all warcraft games and can't get enough of the lore.
---
Horde, all day every day
---
If it’s red it’s dead.
---
This is MORE time to play not less.  There’s no difference if you take the day off or not on the 26th because either you miss a few hours not playing while you’re at work but you CAN play when you get home or you lose all those hours plus more waiting for 12AM.  There’s no need to rush to get to the endgame in classic.  Even if there was there’s also not much difference in starting at 3pm PST and starting at 6pm EST.  Either way you won’t be getting to 60 that day.
---
Who doesn’t love a good GD run but VC was better
---
Well it's not gonna happen. Not anytime soon anyways. I cannot see the talents happen at all, but maybe some class tuning for viability at some point, depending on the community. But BC talents on classic servers? Not saying I'm against it necessarily, but I just can't see them do that at all. It's more likely for them to adapt BC servers at some point (which I consider kind of doubtful as well, seeing as it'd fraction the community very hard to have 3 instances of WoW running and WotlK would be the next logical step...)
---
Nope, Shaman for life
---
Its DM and everyone even claiming its VC is a gigantic troll.  
---
It existed before Dire Maul was even in game.  
---
Noone called a dungeon by its endboss or breadcrumb ever. 
---
He's not great
---
The full history of C'thun and the old gods arrival onto Azeroth up until the beginning of Vanilla! My personal favorite boss in the whole game by far.
---
I never did receive an email. Been playing beta for a little over a week
---
Just found on this sub apparently it's fixed for the beta :(
---
Yes it works, no its not worth it. 
---
Only SoCommand is twistable because it runs a script on hit, and the onyl seal you would twist with it is Justice or Righteousness, and nether is anything to write home about.
---
4 different time zones in the United States champ
---
It was my guild on Eldre'Thalas NA.
---
Gamefaqs.com has tons of wow guides, some fairly outdated, maybe.
---
I can almost hear the beard on his neck growing.
---
The people who waste half a day off
---
Im no expert, but what is the benefit of orc stun resist if you are getting constantly stunned by 3-4 ppl that sit on your ass. You are gonna be stunned one way or another, or am I missing something? In a luckluster bg situation in which you charge into several enemies they all gonna blast cc on you anyway, am I wrong?
---
Which comes in phase 4, so you can drop tailoring after getting your robe of the void and take something else for 3 content release phases.
---
Tailoring doesn't have as much longevity for Warlocks as it does for Mage. Their robe is best-in-slot all the way through BWL, yours gets replaced off a robe that drops from the first boss in MC (and 3 others in MC). It comes back for Warlocks with ZG and the Bloodvine set (best in slot until Naxx), but that set is BoE.
---
Enchanting is a massive money sink. You'll be lucky if you ever recoup your investment and even luckier if it ever turns a profit.
---
It's DM if you're in Westfall for certain, but if in trade chat VC is preferred for deadmines. You can still use DM but you kind of have to specify then.
---
I like wasting half a day of vacation as much as the next guy but at this point I’m better off working launch
---
He never said he doesnt like unprompted pvp.  Just walking by and killing a lowbie for no reason is what the argument is.
---
Hahahahaha look at those funny face distortions hahahahah i'm 10 years old hahahahah i have a simple mind, i see funny face i laugh hahahahahahah
---
dont give those goblins any ideas
---
The stun resist is amazing. Plus tauren have a larger hit box that does nothing but make you easier to hit with melee and aoes, for an ele/resto
---
Yeah! I can still remember the neutral zone massacres!
---
I have 2 accounts.  One 2005 and one 2006.  One has had an active sub (though haven’t played more than a few weeks of each expansion since Wrath or Cata) and one has been inactive since BC.
---
Please guys can we just say "DM East" ect or "Deadmines" so we can move past all of this?
---
If Blizzard said "we're done sending out invites" and then kept inviting F&amp;F (which they're doing), then they'd have lied.
---
Instead they're calling it a "rapid decrease". That way, they can invite all the F&amp;F and Streamers they want and there's nothing you all can say about it.
---
And now I want a horde priest.
---
Thank you so much! :) I really wanted something Classic-themed to put on the wall next to my desk. Tried to get a better version of it outside the frame - only have my phone to take the picture (so it isn't the best, sorry about that. I tidied it up a little and added in some snow) - [https://imgur.com/79mWEhO](https://imgur.com/79mWEhO)
---
&gt;I already proved you wrong
---
Thanks for the laugh LOL
---
Uh... ok?
---
**The 26th** is the important part here.
---
Champ? Really?
---
That’s what you get for neglecting hitrating
---
OOTL what is seal twisting
---
Let’s just call it VC so everyone knows the difference
---
Be a friend or family member of Blizzard.
---
Get to datin' yo
---
At the time I write this I see 60% horde 40% alliance. That's pretty similar to every other time I see this poll.
---
I tend to prefer the attack animations of a female with a bow and a male with a gun. My vote would probably have to go to the male, however, because the female has a bad running animation and an absolutely atrocious falling one. You might think that the falling animation won't come up much but every time you jump down off a root or small hill you have to see it.
---
I’ve legit watched him do it. His stream even called him out on it and he said “no I would never click something I have bound to 1” 
---
Legit awful player. Pretty fucking sad that you think he’s good.
---
I got into the stress test and never got an email...
---
Thanks for all the good info. I plan do a lot of PvP, although still mix in a fair amount of PvE. So it still sounds like engineering and tailoring would be an idea combo at 60. But maybe to prevent myself from feeling poor while leveling, I’ll start with mining or herbalism instead of engineering and then swap later.
---
You mean, what class most resembles Shaman?
---
Paladin
---
Unless it's a caster group.
---
This would be sooooooo good. If i might add one item to the list, don't give 10 man raids the same loot as 25 man raids. At least on my server, along with the other change, it effectively killed 25 man raids
---
Mage spam frostbolt
---
Warlock spam shadow bolt
---
Hunter I guess gets to use two abilities, aimed shot and multi shot, maybe arcane shot?
---
I think melees only seem more engaging because yon generally are moving more to worry about  position, but rotations in general are not all that intense for any class. 
---
That 10 min frost bolt spam is more about the buildup and the immense amount of time spent gearing and preparing for the fight, than the actual fight.
---
There is room for 2-3 corruptions depending on whether your raid uses annihilator or not.
---
Basically yes, to get the pvp sets you need to rank up
---
to around rank 9 which takes quite a bit of time. You don’t need those sets to pvp though but they’re mostly pretty good.
---
I would definitely support lock&gt;rogue. Easier leveling and better 1v1 pvp class. More fun in premade bgs too
---
Play Priest and MC all Shamans you come across, stealing their power.
---
Maybe I wasn't being quite clear. What I meant was that soda buffed a player that flew over him, not the other way around.
---
Poor swifty too old
---
Looks like by the beginning of August I will have around 80 hours of pto so I will probably be right there with you friend
---
&gt;Even with 16 slots there is not room for individual DoTs from players
---
I was wondering if locks could stack corruption/immolation in the smaller 20mans of ZG/AQ20, since there's less players in the raid.  I played vanilla lock, but seriously can't remember if I casted them in the 20mans.  I think I did, but I was the only lock in the raid for the most part.
---
Classic is not out yet? You mean you played vanilla retail or pservers? You played end game content as a casual?
---
You were perfectly clear, it's a 2 way street I believe
---
Stop using the word toxic you knobhead.
---
Low leveled characters on a pve server are free to refrain from opting into world pvp by not flagging themselves. 
---
Leveling on a pvp server comes with the inherent risk of being attacked by higher level players without reason or warning. Sure, it sucks when it happens and isn't fun. That's why they have servers specifically designed for people who don't want to deal with it.
---
Here's a temporary fix for hunters not being able to use Auto Shot. 
---
Unequip your quiver and put the arrows in your bag, relog and make sure you don't use any melee abilities. 
---
If you ever use a melee attack you won't be able to Auto Shot again until you repeat the method mentioned above. Pet is pretty much required, so if you sub level 10 you're pretty much stuck using your melee attacks since Auto Shot will disable itself everytime you're forced to attack in meele.
---
Not all of them no.
---
But that's really besides the point. They are testing shit, and reporting what seems off. That's what you are supposed to be doing.
---
That would be helpful yeah :)
---
How does the process work for dot voting?
---
Killing lowbies is part of the game, and should remain that way.
---
Of course those things can be in the game without flying, but this isnt about changing vanilla, its about discussing flying. We arent all here to circlejerk how vanilla is perfect, because while those things are present in vanilla they can be improved (blasphemy i know, saying a game isnt perfect). Immersion and progression arent binary tickboxes, something can be better or worse, more or less immersive or rewarding.
---
In light of which, i think you are wrong that 'theres nothing but negatives that come with flying' for the reasons outlined that you havent addressed. (which is also why i dont expect to change your mind at this point)
---
Just what a ridiculous point that 'x is in classic so it cant be improved or ever done better'... In terms of the literal design of classic wow i can appreciate wanting authenticity, but if we are just discussing game design in general how can you unironically ask Blizzard to totally stagnate and not change or try to improve anything
---
Trying to figure out who and why some people got access (not talking streamers). My account is from the 2004 open beta. I opted in as soon as it was available because of the hours I work. I got in after the initial streamer invites. I'm wondering if its bc of my account age, immediately opting in and amount of blizzard games owned (almost all). This is the only thing like this I've been lucky enough to participate in so I dont take it lightly
---
Only people who nothing about the competitive scenes for both games would call own casual tf2
---
Ez answer. 1.14 with the developer of Ulduar.
---
Maybe Druid? Nothing else comes to mind.
---
Lmao that’s a good shout. I might have a go at that
---
Sounds good and I’m all for it but in the end you can’t force someone who is paying the same price to play into playing on a server they don’t want to
---
Yeah I’m planning to take the first week off ! I really want to use all my PTO but I know saving some days will come in handy later in the year! Besides one week off to only play a game will be more than enough time to get me off on the right foot! Then maybe it won’t be all I’m thinking of when I’m at work!
---
Sure glad you are not in charge of things.
---
What a novel and unique idea. Haven't seen this suggested on here at all.
---
We have to book our vacations the year prior so I let lower people than me at work have the premium summer time off since they have young kids and mine are grown. I booked off the first three weeks in September instead.  Then this snazzy announcement of Classic coming out at end of August. I couldn't have fist pumped harder.
---
might be wrong about this, but I think you are temporarily de-flagged for PvP during flight, similiar to how you are not flagged in your own capitals/starting zones.
---
ZG wont be out for a while. Dont have to worry about Bloodvine yet
---
Instead of writing this just go PVE man
---
Someone sounds butthurt alright
---
Didnt they say theyre pretty much set on ppl?
---
Play shaman and raid ally cities.
---
I did un sub for about the past 6 months, and I unsubscribed from Cata to warlords, so there is that.
---
Yup, it was in vanilla, prepare your bod to totem twist tranq and wf totem, all raid, every raid.
---
How has nobody mentioned Joana?
---
Check him out,he had done many 1-60 speedruns, and he still tries to improve his guide.
---
www.joanasworld.com ,definitely worth checking out.
---
I plan on doing the same thing I have been doing forever in regards to streamers and streaming... ignoring it completely.
---
If you want to stay tailoring then enchanting is a good pair.  If you want to drop enchanting after getting the robes, I would go tailoring/herbalism and then drop tailoring for alchy.  Just mail the herbs you get to an alt until you are ready to level it.
---
My email arrived about 24 hours after the launcher updated. I'm in the EU not sure if that matters
---
credit: https://twitter.com/Sequisha/status/1132445961614188546
---
Yes it is.   A lot of people would move onto expansions and a lot would stay on classic.  It would most definitely split the community.
---
He made this video, but no voiceover https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGXjoAqjKFU
---
Private server players shouldn't get beta invites
---
My play style had changed. I pretty reliably get to 50 in around 3 days /played with the help of various guides. I have held off doing the 50-60 grind (will probably do it in July).  I have really experienced most of the content and want to race to 60... Something I haven't done in a new server
---
So much wishful thinking in this thread. Vanilla Wow was a game notorious for ruining lives because it takes so much time (serious end game raiding or pvp at least - you can dick around in SM at level 35 for days if that’s what floats your boat). 
---
Unfortunately the reality is that it’s not a casual friendly game for those who like to be competitive and experience all the game has to offer. Take the replies you’re reading here with a grain of salt.
---
Being capped at 30 and having help for ww axe will do that to you.  Definitely not a perfect description of warrior life.
---
I just feel like this would be too much, just use F1, F2, F3 lol
---
Hey, i find it quite odd that you do so much of Tirisfal and Durotar and still dont reach lvl 13 after both zones (UD start). I did only tirisfal, and with killing some mobs along the way i manage to reach level 12.
---
Na. Plan on taking a week off early in August for some real life stuff. I am going to savor my WoW leveling so I am going to take my time.
---
I'm a degen so I ordered this as well. Gonna use the left 2 pedals as my top 2 valuable pet macros at any given level and far right might just be my new push to talk provided it's comfortable to press and hold.
---
I have played as casual in TBC, WOTLK and Classic PServers. Only raided casually in Wotlk.
---
This is just the sort of person I see pro gaming gear marketed to.
---
Well I mean, perception allows you to see through stealth and shadowmeld which is huge if you use it correctly.
---
hope it gets back in.
---
I don't think they care about people rushing. There needs to be a balance with releasing each new Phase to accommodate people who arn't playing 40+ hours per week.
---
"Gnomes are a solid choice for Mages and Warlocks due to ￼ Expansive Mind, as Intellect increases the mana pool and chance to critically hit with spells.
---
The Engineering bonus is beneficial as Engineering is a strong profession for both PvE and PvP.
---
￼ Escape Artist is a good racial for PvP."
---
It really makes a difference.
---
Orcs get nothing for shaman(non-enhance), they don't even have a stun resists talent to make the racial worth it.
---
what if you keep f1,f2,f3 for whatever else and you can just gain 3 easy to access keys with this foot pedal
---
i can see why you might not but even an mmo mouse isnt enough for me with all the macros iv gotten into lately at max level 60 on psvs
---
If people stick around, that’s actually fine, because people will be playing less hours per week. The first few weeks we need layering because everyone will be on constantly, but after a bit, we may have the same number of active players on the server, but people will be logged off more often.
---
And full servers that have queues won’t attract new players that don’t already have characters on them.
---
Like, so after 3 weeks if everyone starts going back to work and school and having some social stuff, everyone will play maybe half as often as at launch, and so the max pop can be lowered. It’s not about active players per day, but hours per day which affects active pop size.
---
hahaha im too old and intelligent to laugh at anything hahaha im superior to you because i have a refined sense of humor and can't laugh at anything because it may show others that i have some immaturity in me hahahahaha maybe upload another class guide and then ill watch haahahahaha
---
It's not real stance dancing unless you macro it to a DDR pad.
---
Only time I used it. 
---
Though we didn't really do much totem twisting back then
---
Check out the Logitech G602.
---
Undead mage for me. Same when I rolled in Vanilla

 Found temporary fix for hunter  Auto shot bug. Remove the ammo from your Ammo pouch/Quiver. Remove the Ammo pouch/Quiver. Replace with a bag. Relog. Fixed. Just dont use your Ammo bag/Quiver till the bug is fixed by blizz.  
---
Its working with melee attacks and everything. Confirmed with all abilities. Do it just as described and it works 100%
---
I haven't played high end ally before but I'm pretty sure it's gnome all the way. Escape artist is bis PvP and the int boost isn't shabby for pve. 
---
I would not level with tailoring or engineering. You could make a case for tailoring depending on how you are going to level because you can make some decent gear for along the way. But if you're rushing 60 and not trying to break any records I'd do skinning and mining for leveling cash and mats. The gold per hour you make at 60 is way more efficient and you can just power level both without much trouble.
---
Your music is on point man! Probly the best rundown ive seen, tho im not exactly watching videos on Cthun all day to be fair lmao. Part with the trolls was sick
---
You won't see HUGE differences. Play what you really like! The only difference that matters is if you play PvP.
---
Blackrock Mountain:  reaching the vast doors, the dragons flying around, Forgewright's tomb, finding out all the secret paths and finally, getting ganked a lot while heading for an instance.
---
For me, it was there (and in Stormwind) that Warcraft went full circle, from Warcraft 1 to World of Warcraft.
---
But clearly there a specific streamers whom you have seen this behavior from. So, obligatory not all streamers.
---
&gt;  what is seal twisting
---
Seal Twisting is a hidden mechanic that allows you to use 2 Paladin seals at one time per swing. 
---
It only worked with Seal of Command as the initiator. When you have that up, right before you swing you activate another Seal to get the Command + X Seal proc. Historically Blood Elf Paladins used it late TBC to combine Seal of Command with Seal of Blood, but not much else.
---
It's a matter of personal interest. The last thing I want is to get stuck in Hillsbrad, STV, or any other heavy traffic quest hub with a streamer and his occult. It'll take forever to quest and finding resource nodes will be nigh impossible. If you ask around, most people would probably say the same thing
---
Well next time perhaps get a clue before spreading misinformation. Even the screenshot you linked was only the case for a short while during Cata, where they broke night time. Yes even after they fixed it, it was brighter than Vanilla but not nearly as bright as the screenshot you linked. They have since then, bought night time back similar to how it was in Vanilla.
---
So yeah, you remember a short specific moment in time apparently that caters to the "shit on retail" circlejerk, how convenient.
---
PvP-wise Escape artist is nice. Not as good on a mage as it is on other classes, but still solid. 
---
Same goes for int bonus, having 0,5% more crit and 2 more free spell casts is good. 
---
But better to have, and not need, than to need, and not have.
---
Nah, it was 440, so you needed only 140 extra from gear. Crit chance for bosses against players was 5.6%, so druids didn't need to bother with their -6% to be critted from talents. Which was great since +defense leather armor didn't exist.
---
You have to keep in mind that Vanilla and BC bosses could also Crushing Blow players. To avoid that, one needed to achieve 102.4% avoidance. AFAIK, only warriors could do that in Vanilla and only with Shield Block active.
---
I think we've also become different as gamers than we were back then. For many (including me) it is much more about optimizing and we forget to have fun sometimes.
---
I agree with you that BC brought some positive additions to the game that I'd welcome to any iteration of WoW (brutal dungeon difficulties and crazy attunement paths for example) but flying just simply isn't one of those positive additions. 
---
My point is that what positive aspects does flying bring to the game that we don't already have? and do those positives outweigh the negatives? TBC would have simply been a better expansion without flying mounts.
---
All the boomer dads on here replying to posts exactly like the meme that was on the front page the other day. 
---
“Of course you’ll have fun playing vanilla wow, son! Just grind 436 more nodes of ore so you can afford your mount! It’s casual!”
---
I don't think it'll be an issue if everyone sticks around and layering goes away.  The major reason to have layering in the first place is so that the server can handle the massive concentrations of players that you'll have near launch.  As soon as players spread out into the world and start having choices of where to level up, layering will be much less necessary.
---
Play the character you like looking at. It won't make that much of a difference in the end.
---
But gnome is definitely the best mage on either faction.
---
Hah, yes.  I have the same staff and clothes except I'm wearing a monocle on my level 15 dwarf warrior Bank alt from TBC and Wrath.
---
Problem is, pvp gear will always be there. Unarmored will not.
---
No, not all streamers, but even the alright ones will have a group with them soaking up all the mobs and resources. It doesn't matter what faction you are, it'll hurt the economy either way
---
but the old map doesn't have the maelstrom, or northrend
---
So it was more fun back then because no matter how little you knew, there were always people who knew less than you and you could completely waste in PvP?
---
Hey, whatever is Fun For You Is Fun For You. And like any human, practice improves.
---
Just play the game and have fun. When did people all of a sudden start getting performance anxiety from something they are supposed to have fun with? Chill the hell out and just enjoy the experience.
---
Everything said here is true.
---
Melelululelelulilullul
---
So then you take it easy that first week, find out where the big streamers have rolled, then roll elsewhere.
---
Doesnt work on beta
---
Gnome has all its racials going for Mage, so yea. It's not just Escape Artist.
---
Dot voting doesn't really make sense in this situation, since picking your class is a personal decision. In this case you're just having your wife help you decide what to play.
---
well shouldn't the reverse be true considering the size of some bosses.
---
Invisibility potions are your friend.
---
Disenchanting can be a way to make money by selling mats to players.
---
However, to further dissuade you from enchanting, and if I'm remembering correctly, the trainers are all over the place. I remember one spawned in Uldaman and you either needed a group to just train your profession or wait until you could solo the place.
---
Needless to say, I leveled it on a druid and couldn't drop it until recently because I spent so much time and effort on it back in the day.
---
Because wow classic is aimed at another audience then retail wow? Mainly returning/old players, who haven't touched wow after it turned into the shit fest it is today. The wow we have today is aimed at an arguably younger and less western audience, then vanilla ever was. 
---
Granted, it makes little economic sense to hand out invites to non paying people, but at the same time it would create more subscriptions, because you are already paying and theres a good chance a returning player would be willing to pay for beta access, but not for current wow retail.
---
red = dead
---
it's the law
---
make it a toggle, or have addons that can replicate it. problem solved.
---
No this is not true. No cross-realm in classic, thank god.
---
Maybe it's a bug, as it was working in vanilla
---
Had the same reaction watching him level :(
---
He was like “I practiced! Going for world first lvl 30!” And he leveled so slow.
---
Gotta watch snutz, maybe that’ll make me feel better about warlock again
---
There's a guy in beta I talked to who says he first started playing in MoP. Meaning account age isnt entirely what flags your account for beta. I'd really like to know what all the flags are and if there's an element of randomness.
---
Well there really no point for a resto to do it, your mana is too valuable for the difference it would make.
---
Enhancement would do it because they would do horrible dps regardless, might as well click a few more buttons and boost the actual dps classes. But it was usually agi and wf, not tranquil air.
---
Lol it's not like you'll have an easy, competition free leveling experience without streamers.
---
Servers are going to be packed.
---
HeyGuys
---
shit is gonna be so delayed it might be practical in having more keybinds or whatever but it's so slow. Get a MMO mouse and you'll have more buttons and react way faster with them.
---
Cali 12 weeks. 6 weeks paid for 60-70%, which you can fill up to 100% with PTO from your work.
---
Rushing is specifically the reason they gave for the mounts being removed. I'm not going to get into the release pace of the phases since I think it's kind of a different topic, but removing the mounts is the worst solution. It won't prevent people from rushing through leveling, and if it's a concern they could keep them in for the first two phases instead.
---
For PVE no it doesn't matter.
---
For PVP yes it does.
---
Are you saying spamming Healing Touch ain't exciting? :o
---
Definitely what I'll be doing. I feel like it would be good for the community in general if streamers would all stick to their own realms
---
Come kill ragnaros with new friends here ;)

---
We will be starting a guild when classic hits NA pvp
---
I think those would be way better as modifiers, would that be possible?
---
The extra attacks are white hits that generate rage not specials, so they should use the 24% miss chance.  
---
That is based on logic and not experience, perhaps someone else would know better then me.  
---
I don't know what you are comparing HoJ to, but HoJ should be BIS for all melee through phases 1 and 2.  First better trinket isnt until Drake Fang Talisman in BWL.
---
I wonder why the dark shore docks are so long.  Feels like a kilometer
---
These people want to have it both ways. They don't want to be seen as PVE carebears but their ego is too fragile to deal with the embarassment of losing in wpvp, so we get these "toxic faction supremacy its just a game guys" posts to try and claim the moral high ground to crybully people.
---
I did a bit of leveling on a private server the PvP was non stop fun and some bouts of being Corpse Camping by people.  But I'm a old hand at escaping Corpse Camping.  Best part was beating someone 8 levels higher than me, who caught me on mount with a SS + freezing trap.  I pulled out all the stops and won by about 100HP.  Overcoming the odds in WPvP is just awesome.
---
It wasn't JUST Frost bolt. It was Frost bolt, Frost bolt rank 2, Frost bolt rank 3, Frost bolt, ..etc 😁
---
I get that. Normal congestion is fine. But streamers introduce an abnormal amount of traffic into whatever zone they're in by default
---
Fair enough
---
The cap is 440, but you don't really NEED to reach the cap before raiding, as early raid bosses can't one shot tanks with 1 crit
---
lol delayed based on what? you have no clue what you're talking about if you think there's an input lag on these switches significant enough to affect anything
---
Honestly it seems like they'd be too slow for my tastes, but I guess I've never used foot pedals before.
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Defense](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Defense)   
---
Looks like +140 was needed for a lvl 60 to be crit-immune from raid bosses?   
---
Going off of [this](http://wowclassicbis.com/) you can get to +126 (defense alone, not counting any other 1% parry/etc deductions) pre-Naxx with just gear. Post-naxx only +130??
---
Hello yes I would like to buy one
---
If you don't find fun in PvP (both the killing and escaping gankers) then don't roll on a PvP server.
---
Don't bother. this kid is r/iamverysmart personified.
---
Yeah they have level 40 weapons but no proper abilities at this level. It’s kind of a weird impression you get from the beta.
---
You were pugging MC but mastered all of Vanilla’s “elite” content 14 years ago. Unless you mean coming back and clearing Naxx during BC something doesn’t add up.
---
Music in Teldrassil and Ashenvale. Gets me every time I hear it.
---
I've always seen/called it VC. DM was Dire Maul. 
---
Even before I knew what Dire Maul was, everyone called it VC.
---
Based on your feedback, I think that mining and engineering is good option for me. Mining will generate some good cash flow and support engineering. 
---
I plan to do some more research, thanks for the detailed reply.
---
I remember making an undead mage for the first time and getting this staff and being amazed at how cool it looked for low level. I was always sad to replace it.
---
Lololololol!  
---
"We need to round up all the streamers and put them in a camp! They are ruining the world......of warcraft for me!!!! We need to brand them, segregate them and their communities because I won't get phat loots otherwise!" 
---
This sub never fails to make me laugh, and feel terrified for our species at the same time.
---
so glad I don't work or have uni/school :) ~16 hr days here i come
---
I want to level a hunter with engineering, but I’m not sure if leveling engineering is good on a fresh server due to fighting for mining nodes and the overall gold sink of engineering. Thoughts?
---
Not my main, that has been set in stone for a good while now. But I am still not sure about what my twink should be, that gets changed all the time. Currently I am leaning towards warrior because I really like tanking 5mans
---
WoW and WoW Classic are pretty different games. Without knowing what other games you like and why it's hard to say if you will enjoy WoW or WoW Classic.
---
The nights are the same dark as they were in Vanilla currently in BfA.
---
It was not darker. I am sure of this and it's easy to find proof. 
---
This is a non-issue people just like to throw around to shit on retail, but it's fake news.
---
it probably takes getting used to but i'm confident these won't have noticeable inputlag.
---
Warrior works best killing mobs 1 level or more lower than your level while on a quest. This works best when you can alternate zones. For example finishing a few quests in Loch Modan then going to Westfall then back to Loch Modan. If you feel like it's going really slow in the starting zone you can also go to a different starting zone and do a few quests there also.
---
Thanks for the reply, yeah makes sense. I think that I will go for engineering and mining.
---
only the liars
---
If it's a USB input, wouldn't it have the same input time as a USB mouse?
---
Yep I was leaning towards 49 for most abilities but now im thinking 39 is the best bracket.  No mounts is a plus to me especially as a ele with ghost wolf. Less time to level up and less time to get geared....  And I wont completely overlevel everybody in STV.  Gonna need to farm some gold for that Staff of Jordan though... sigh.
---
&gt; The element of WPvP adds a lot of excitment but it's frustrating as hell if your main is just ment for PvE, to fill a specific roll for dungeons and raiding that makes him almost useless in a PvP scenario.
---
I rolled a druid just to help my guild in the MC as a healer.  I leveled him full Feral PvP spec all the way to 60.  No reason not to have fun even when leveling a PvE toon.  Of course when I hit 60 and respected restro, I was super frustrating for people to kill.  I didn't often kill them, but I seldom died to gank attempts.
---
Flying should only be a end game thing and restricted  to some maps.
---
lmao this guy just said cute
---
Just play ret meme in a casual guild and you can wear plate.
---
But yeah, for any serious guilds, up to AQ40, you will be wearing Cloth as healadin.
---
Probably.  I was corpse camped at least 100 times my first time leveling.  By the time I hit 60 I knew every trick in the book to escape a CC attempt.  But I did play a very hardcore world PvP server.
---
Hi, /u/NoRecording1
---
Nice meme.
---
Ye, since rogues do have a bad time as well, definitely not 5x better than warriors.
---
People still do this on live now. You still see low levels in tuxedos in the AH.
---
The panels themselves is the delay.
---
SM/Ruin is the best "all around" spec. It'll let you do everything viably.
---
Are you in beta? Are you experiencing this or is this all pure conjecture?
---
Daaaamn, would kill for a tankard of terror. Would spice our dnd games.
---
Not the World of Warcraft I used to play.
---
Not a popular answer for getting upvotes, but definitely more accurate.
---
Exactly, this would be far more useful if these could increase your available keybinds by 3x instead of 3 additional keys.
---
Like I've already said, it's gonna ruin the economy. You've got one person running around with a hundred other people following him around. Wherever he goes, that group will take out every mob, farm every node, and throw of the balance of everything. If you haven't noticed, people are already trying their best to avoid streamers. Might as well give them their own place to avoid destroying the community
---
Padels like these cannot be pressed down fast like a keyboard. 
---
Just try do a reflex test and use the panels to see the probably 200ms difference.
---
Nah that’s intentional. 
---
Gotta give the horde a handicap consider how garbage they usually are at pvp
---
Them limiting content because they think it's good for us doesn't sit right with me at all.  There is still going to be a rush to cap, especially on pvp servers where people want to get enough levels and gear early on so they don't get stomped by the opposite faction. If they're so concerned about people missing out the mounts they could always just leave them in for longer.
---
Debating whether or not to make a thread for this but here it goes.  
---
I'm debating whether to roll a druid, a warrior, or a rogue. I've played warrior in Cata, and a paladin in WoTLK and beyond and I never really enjoyed the flavor of the warrior but I really love tanking. Rogue in vanilla seems fun with the poisons and lockpicking - but of course I couldn't tank. Druid seems like a nice compromise, but lots of people say that I would be expected to heal - which isn't really my thing. I'm planning on playing really casually - only on the weekends - I'd like to see the raids but I'd have to look for a guild that did them on the weekends.  
---
Any advice? Would a warrior be a waste since I'd be casual and they're so gear dependent? Would a druid be a bad idea since I wouldn't be able to outgear other rogues/warriors?
---
I love Swifty.  He makes me happy.
---
Vanilla has pretty much the same thing with caster gear.
---
For prebis mage you need to get the right green drop with the right suffix and the right value on suffix. Obviously you don't farm it you just buy off some random guys drop, but it's basically the same slotmachine.
---
Damn that’s a tough pill to swallow. I want to be competitive but then again muh immersion...
---
I'm in the EXACT SAME situation as you - I love Shaman the most out of all classes but I prefer Alliance as a faction. Therefore, I'll be maining a Ret Paladin (I like the Ret class fantasy too) and have a Shaman alt on a different server.
---
If anyone is looking for a NA Pvp guild when classic launches (that plans  to raid) come join us at

You can pause it and see he clearly had the flag on his back...
---
Dun Mode, because of the layouy and NPCs shoot at each other, it feels like a
---
When the previous benchmark was Everquest that’s not saying much.
---
It's from reading opinions here and watching streamers in beta and in retail. In a world as small as classic, the presence of streamers will upset the balance if not accounted for.
---
Bro.... you're not able to frost shock kite a decent warrior. 
---
He will always have hamstring on you because of intercept or fear to close the gap. 
---
You may be able to kite him for 5-10 seconds, but that's all a geared warrior needs to kill any class besides a paladin.
---
That's not spell batching.
---
Hunter rotations with autoshot weaving are actually relatively complex at the highest level.
---
I will check him out , this comment interests me.
---
 Nothing against other streams but I find a fair of WoW content  creators to have a God complex that is very offputting.
---
I wonder how much that draw distance and fog of war led to people remembering it being super dark?
---
I mean back in 2004 most people played on potatoes and as that video shows draw distance sucked.
---
Again, its not so much thats its possible to do so.  Its why even bother doing it?  I dont know about you but i dont get any enjoyment in shitting on someones fun.
---
Oh I agree it's most likely not gonna happen. I don't even think we'll get the stuff originally meant for Vanilla that got pushed to BC. I'd hope we may get some degree of balancing to make other specs more viable though, especially alternative tanks (Prot Pally and I'd assume it'd be a tweaked Enhance Shammy for Horde, unless they drop the classes being faction specific).
---
Its not a dress... its kilt.
---
Calm the fuck down dude, jesus
---
It cemented my choice to play a gnome warrior because I had opportunity to ask the burning questions I had about their shortcomings. It’s what I wanted to play before knowing about Monkeynews and Tribe and Helvete, but I doubted it would be a good choice because I mostly prefer PvE and humans are just better at that. 
---
I’m very confused about professions now, though. Might go herb/skinning, transition to herb/alchemy and then switch to engi/alchemy with a farming alt or go mining/engi because mining is good to farm mats for equip at 60 and engi is great for tanking and PvP. Maybe have a mage as farming alt
---
I agree. It sacrifices a bit of dps not having sacrifice demon, but having the demons allows for more game play than just max dps in raids.
---
Simple question because I cannot remember myself. Did /camp port you outside the instance in vanilla? If someone knows ans better yet has video proof.
---
How the mighty have fallen. I'll always love you Swifty.
---
I'm not even sure this is sell batching, but yeah something funny going on. You can that he gets the flag carrying buff.
---
Okay real shit, who tf ever uses F-anything as a key bind in any game? What kind of long monkey fingers do you have to be able to reach those buttons in the middle of combat?
---
theres no best of both world, thairs Classic/BC/WotLK up until halfway though and then theres trash
---
Your username gives away why you took the bait so hard.
---
Get triggered, son.
---
Torn between Priest and Druid. I feel like my life would be easier as a Druid since I'm rolling on a PvP server. But Priests seem like the healer to be in Vanilla.
---
If you have mining leveled, engr is quite cheap.  You will mine or naturally gather practically everything that you need other then a few stacks of leather, but at server launch there will be so many skinners that leather typically sells at just over vendor price.  
---
The issue is leveling mining while leveling can be quite hard.  You have to run out of your way for nodes, and particularly around the tin range, there is often just not enough tin to be found.  You have to backtrack and run around for hours to get it to a high enough level.   
---
That's why a lot of people wait to do mining until they buy their 40 mount or even wait until 60.
---
What ever you say Mein Führer.....
---
Eh you just monitor an auto shot timer add on and make sure not to clip your auto shot reload. But i agree it’s a bit more than some other classes in terms of things to manage.
---
It should do
---
It stays 16 debuffs. Increasing it would imbalance raids
---
Rotations are VERY simple in vanilla, it is not something that is important or used to seperate bad from good players.
---
I find it amazing that I can actually recognize a ton of people from that video since it was all filmed on Destromath which was the server I played on.
---
Are you focused on PVE or PVP? Either way both races are strong. Perception is an extremely underrated racial. And Diplomacy makes every rep grind easier.
---
Play whichever one you like best. Escape Artist will mean the difference in a few fights, but it won't make or break you making a PVP rank.
---
I'm going to take the dive and attempt to learn healer in classic and I was thinking of 3 options, paladin, shaman, or priest?
---
I haven't decided  between alliance or horde yet (but leaning towards horde) but I was thinking paladin or shaman due to their raw utility, but priest has the highest throughput from what I've heard. I plan to focus a bit more on PvP since idk if I'll have the time to spend hours farming for consumables and materials for raiding.
---
I've actually spotted a couple in game. Like in Redridge Mountains, when you kill the pig Princess for a quest, your reward is a bouquet of Scarlet Begonias!
---
They have started remaking old world zones for various end game stuff in BfA. So we Arathi and Darkshore has so far been made into "warfronts", which is basically WC3 in WoW, where you play the heroes, ish. Unfortunately the warfront gameplay is done really badly (one of several reasons people dislike BfA). But it looks cool, sure.
---
Call me what you want, but if you don't believe me, by all means, go play on a server with a streamer. I'm sure you'll enjoy it
---
You could just boost the bosses hp wouldnt imbalance raids and would enable classes that rely on debuffs to play to their real extent and not feel gimped in a endgame environment
---
I bet you cried in chat that it's spell batching too. Crazy that people are that uneducated.
---
You should put up sticky notes on a wall of things you like about the classes, then pick three of them and go with the class that fits those three the best. Do the same for races and see if you're lucky enough to have them match.
---
Probably a lot. You can't even turn draw distance down on BfA to the levels it could go down to back in Vanilla. My screenshot was with draw distance all the way down in an attempt to emulate that fog of war and the video is even lower.
---
why would the change the debuff limit? go play bfa
---
Well, if you are wearing the lantern, enemy will see you far ahead. 
---
Rouges wont need stealth.
---
I HATE THIS SUB AND EVERYTHING IN IT BECAUSE ALL I WANT IS CLASSIC AND THIS SUB KILLS ME!!!!!
---
Yeah that sounds about right - I’ll be doing something similar. Just leveled a rogue recently and stopped at 56 because I’ve seen most of the leveling content and don’t plan to do end game progression until classic is out.
---
Play Warcraft 3 first. 
---
It won’t really help your gameplay in WoW, but I remember loving the transition myself. It’s awesome to be able to recognize characters and zones from the previous game, and you will familiarize yourself with the world.
---
Health....Health? Did you just say HEALTH????? Bosses aren't designed around their health. You'd have to change more than that, and we are #nochanges
---
Would you elaborate?
---
I want 1.13.1 with a raid that doesn\t have a debuff cap, and see how it would affect the meta game.
---
Hi, /u/laubtom
---
It was interesting on paper, unfortunately Blizzard's implementation left a lot to be desired. It's a PvE only scripted encounter on rails (it's very hard to fail).
---
The zones look nice though.
---
I play retail on an HP Omen 15 inch laptop. It does fine. Just get a cooling tray for it to keep the airflow and keep the vents clean periodically.
---
15 inches is enough, but when you are at the house and want more I recommend a second monitor 19-21 inches min.
---
Couple points (mostly from The Prophecy of C'Thun):
---
* C'Thun was thought dead, not imprisoned. He may or may not have killed a Titan in this battle.
---
* C'Thun didn't have a name until the Qiraji he created gave him one.
---
* The Red, Blue, and Green dragonflights had to help in creating the sealed wall.
---
* Un'Goro Crater is immune to C'Thun and his minions, they call it "the god lands" and cannot penetrate it.
---
We can never separate our dissatisfaction with the changes made to the game from out own burnout from how much we each chose to play.
---
The overwhelming majority players are still terrible at the game. 
---
That being said, there are people that have played the game for a very long time and are very skilled. If you end up playing against or with people like that you’ll catch up in skill very quickly. Especially if you apply yourself by looking up all the available information.
---
Well there is also weaving melee and raptor strikes as well as feign trinket swapping. Plus your rotation changes depending on the speed of your weapon.
---
Yeah I’m sure there will be so many shamans. People will get to pick and choose between thousands of highly skilled ones. Okay bud 👌
---
Either is fine for pvp. For PvE destruction past ruin sucks though. Even if you go to conflag in any raid 90% of your damage will be shadowbolts and you're losing a flat 10% damage without SM.
---
Because its stupid?
---
You can't use proc weapons, any DotS and a lot of classes sucks because of it (locks, spriests and oomkins might be better with increaased dot cap). Obviously it adds some strategy on what dots should be prioritized in any raid, but I think its really lame to not be able to use fun proc weapons and DotS.
---
Less about being inputlag and more about your feet dont have the same dexterity and motoric skills like your fingers have. 
---
Depends on what you want to use them with but i wouldn't want to have important stuff on a foot pedal its just slower but i know people that use a foot pedal for stuff like push to talk or stuff like that.
---
Agreed. It's DM, always has been, always will be.
---
I would go tailoring and engineering (for PvP and PvE (extra AoE dmg)). When I crafted the Robe of the Void I would drop tailoring for a gather profession like Herb och Mining to make some money.
---
Orc is better.  Tauren range prevents people from jumping your charge but that is a minor benefit compared to orc racial.
---
It's ma'am
---
Yeah HEALTH HEALTH, debuffs is just more dps and that's the only thing that would change, classes would perform more dps which would only kill stuff faster. It's to make classes that are not viable, viable. It's just a matter of balance and would improve the experience of raiding for those classes
---
The 26 is irrelevant. The problem is that it’s releasing in the middle of the day or early night . If you take a day off you waste half the day and if you work you won’t get sleep for launch. It’s stupid 12am is the optimal time for all time zones
---
I don't think it is. Windfury totem itself increases melee damage by a fuckton and that's excluding things like strength of air etc. Remember in vanilla itit gives 20% chance for extra hit with bonus AP.
---
I believe even if enh did 60% of warrior's damage, it could still be worth it.
---
I really envy guys like you.  I’ve played from day 1 and all i can remember was i played Horde on a pvp server    that’s literally it.    Don’t remember class or server. Oh kinda remember first time seeing war in Tarren Mill.  That was pretty unforgettable
---
Why down-rank frost bolt? For cast time reasons?
---
Oh man that is actually great quality! Did you use some scanning app? 
---
Also, would you mind if I printed this out for personal use? I love the artstyle a lot!
---
Possibly. Or you could do autenthic vanilla experience. Devs opted for the later
---
IF or bust.
---
Is ranking up a grind or do I have to be legitimately good at PvP?
---
I ask this because I would love to slowly chip away at grinding through pvp over time but I am not sure how viable it is in relation to ranking up.
---
two weeks into the beta y'all back with these low energy memes. my boy
---
\&gt;The problem is *that I don't know how to deal with the most minor of first world problems and have to rant like a child about it.*
---
Ooooh okay. Got it, champ.
---
I'll always remember IF and Dun Morogh for the first time on my first character, but I will always always cherish and remember the first time I was in Duskwood and just how genuinely creepy it was to my 13 year old self.
---
5 weaponskill is absolutely noticable in pve.
---
mages dont need racials to assblast anyone
---
I have many times.  You cannot avoid it. I have also seen big streamers have their entire army wiped out by less than half their numbers with actual skill. The economy is ruled by the best players / farmers. You think streamers are bad then you are new to classic and never met the the devilsaur or lotus mafia. Come back after release after you cant get a single  node or mob because a mafia farmer is ruling your economy, and not even a huge army of spergs or viewers can stop them. You are preaching hateful shit and need to have a coffee. Just stop following asmongold around and you will be fine. Because I promise streamers are the least of your concerns if this is your take on classic.
---
Less engaging gameplay means they put less effort into the world you dumb fuck. Unless your head is so far up your ass that you can’t tell, vanilla has more world content and tbc has more instanced content. Hala and the Spirit Towers were a waste of fucking time compared to heroic, t4 raid, and s1 pvp gear.
---
It was definitely a thing.  IIRC you could turn in the quest but the buff wouldn't trigger if a head was already up.  It took half a day or longer for the head to go away.
---
The scaling int DOES matter but not that much
---
I like the elf zones but how could you leave the absolute best zone ever, Dun Morogh??
---
Actually I remember following this thread since 2011: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/6297803551
---
And it had numerous continuations: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/6600169954
---
It went like that from Cataclysm and they only fixed it in WoD IIRC (haven't played since WotLK but I've been following the development of the last immersive RPG element left in the game, so I can tell you with certainty that it was longer than "a short moment in Cata". Check the screenshots and dates on all of the posts. I would link the vids from youtube when they reverted the change slowly zone by zone (Elwyyn was first, I remember that vividly) but I'm walking home right now. I'll try to find it when I get back on PC.
---
TL;DR: It wasn't a short period of time, it got fucked with Cata and lasted somewhere til mid-WoD.
---
There might be a program like tmorph available for Classic which you can use if you want to immerse yourself in your looks.

[https://www.twitch.tv/staysafetv](https://www.twitch.tv/staysafetv) \- Warlock
---
Gnome does have a non insignificant edge over human casters. I wanted to main warlock but because I can’t help but min-max, which means id have to be a fucking gnome I opted for human warrior.
---
On the PvE side you won't necessarily have to farm consumables. Back in the day I was in a casual guild that cleared BWL and I never had to farm anything.
---
In terms of the class I would recommend shaman for the joy of chain heal and totems. Chain heal is easily the most satisfying spell in the game.
---
Tarren Mill  on a PvP server. Just beautiful
---
I turn on my war mode in world of Warcraft. I think it’s safe to call it a war.
---
Ooh, that's the ideal way for it to work, sick. The reset on the swing timer is unfortunate though, that's basically impossible to calculate properly.
---
thoughts on having both herbalism and skinning as my professions when leveling as a hunter?
---
the difference would be people could play classes they wanted instead of having 15 mages in the raid
---
Not with that attitude you don't.
---
than don’t play classic? no one is forcing you to play the game. okay retail if you want a game where every class can do everything at every time
---
Yeah once they added AH to SW there was a decent balance between the cities.  IF was still more populated but it wasn't the same as Org.
---
Hi, /u/moonpoo7
---
You have obviously not played classic then. If you made a change like that would immediately make warlocks stronger. Warlocks weakness pre aq is too little hit. Dot ticks can't resist. More warlock dps would mean more caster heavy raid comps. More caster heavy raid comps would make bosses like Golemagg at least a little bit easier, despite health. Dont sueggest changes if you havent even tried without
---
that’s not classic, i think you’d enjoy retail wow more. go play that
---
You would have to increase alot of things. As debuffs does more then damage the boss. Overall I thing going with 16 instead of the 8 some of the earlier raids only had is already stretching it
---
Suffering from succes?
---
There are quite a few mitigation debuffs that would become available with unlimited debuff slots.
---
Are these compatible with most wheelchairs? Because if they are I wanna order one of those to tipsout.
---
Well yeah ofc everything counts, but it's not really something significant enough to worry about.
---
Chuck Norris will be pleased
---
On paper I do too, just Ive never played a caster class as a main and usually always get an itch to play melee
---
exploration leveling is a meme created to get retards out of the starting zones during fresh launches
---
The debuff cap was never intended, it was entirely a technical limitation. And yes, all the raids in vanilla are balanced around it, but it doesn't mean that it is necessarily a good game-mechanic.
---
Again, it was not intended and it severly limits some classes, while affecting other in a smaller way (rogues can't use deadly poison, hunters can't use stings etc.)
---
To be fair, neither is the pvp racials. Play what you like
---
I think i couldnt trigger it fast enough, depending on the preassuring points of the footpads, nice idea thought, but i mash the buttons when stancedancing bound with charge, shieldbash, or intercept. But maybe with some training i could handle it in 1-2 weeks to a perfect result
---
Shadow priests are very powerful in pvp and dungeons. They just go oom too quickly in raids, though most raids still bring one, primarily for the shadow damage debuff.
---
But mostly what classic raiding is about micro managed you resources and debuffs. You would take out half the raiding experience by increasing it
---
I'm taking 2 weeks vacation  time off for launch of classic. 
---
Going to pull all nighters for the first couple days. Try to have 1-60 done In 2 weeks.
---
Flying mounts in tbc made sense because it was a shattered continent. It also acted as an attunement for raids such as arcatraz, botanica, and mechanica?
---
Live to win on repeat
---
Both sucks.
---
enjoy vanilla :)
---
My favorite boss from Vanilla, both lore wise and probably the fight as well. It's practically a dance. Anyone else a fan? Made a video outlining his lore, beginning with his arrival on Azeroth (along with the other 3 old gods) up until the beginning of Vanilla. Hope some of ya'll enjoy!
---
For most games, yes.  In the case of the walk/run animation in WoW, the animation has no affect on the gameplay.  You can play any random animation during the walk/run cycle and the character will still move at the correct speed while just playing a random animation over it.  The two systems are divorced from one another and the reasons for this lie in making the character position independent of your animation for the sake of server corrections and client prediction.  
---
I'm all for #nochanges, but to be completely fair, I'm sure everyone has #somechanges that would objectively improve things.  The problem is when those changes affect the underlying mechanics.
---
Because we know from Vanilla that the animation simply plays at whatever damn speed it wants, while the movement speed is independent, this would be one change that would have zero effect on gameplay.
---
You don't think purposefully running into melee range of a paladin when he has freedom is playing poorly?
---
Careful, this can and has resulted in bans.
---
I think Orc is the keyword here more than anything ells. Orcs are the counter to rogues and rogues are the counter to warlocks. Warlock is very top tier in 1v1 and rogues are pretty much the only ones that beat them unless we are talking SL master race dueling spec. Very skilled mages go about 50/50 with warlocks also but when skill level goes down it gets tilted heavily in warlock favor.
---
I don’t know if you’re trolling or serious and I’m NOT trying to be belittling.  If you’re newer to looking into classic, then I just want to let you know people have discussed this to death.
---
The community and Blizzard are leaning heavily into the no changes route and recreating the most authentic experience of vanilla as possible.  (Some UI changes will be going through though.)
---
The debuff limit is going to be 16 and health pools will remain the same because the game is not looking to rebalance anything.  The game is trying to recreate what existed ~14 years ago.
---
I personally would lean towards a balanced version of vanilla with large debuff pools and balanced classes so more than a warrior could tank raids, but that’s not what they’re trying to make.
---
Know that I feel you on where you’re coming from, but the game is aimed to be accurate to its roots.  I’ll enjoy it either way, myself!  :)
---
For pvp undead hands down. Great mage streamer is Kraun
---
This was one of the first WoW videos I ever downloaded via limewire and game my computer aids in the process, so I’m overly nostalgic about this but looking at it now holy moly it’s so god damn bad. 
---
I love it 10/10
---
How is warlock dps in dungeons and raids compared to mage?
---
In-game music mostly
---
good idea tbh, I should spread that.
---
Toss in some soil work
---
They have all the testers they need. Unless your a large content creator or have a high up friend at blizz. You won’t be begging beta.
---
I'm not saying you shouldn't play what you want, but pvp racials is something to worry about. You use escape artist versus like half the classes, it's very noticable, having a slight int and very very slight crit chance is not something you notice.
---
I want to play paladin because it looks fun/ easyish, but all my friends want to play horde again. :'(
---
Lol for real. His monotone game is insane. Idk why he can't make his voice a bit more exciting.
---
who gives a fuck if it was a good game mechanic? it’s part of vanilla. if you want all the classes to be equal then go play retail
---
&gt;But mostly what classic raiding is about micro managed you resources and debuffs. 
---
The debuff cap is such a non-factor that it doesn't even matter. Just tell everyone don't use your shit dots, and thats about it. And they even override eachother based on DoT tiers.
---
But obviously can't change the cap because the entire games is balanced around it, but if they were to do something like 1.13, I would like to see the debuff cap being removed from the new raids if they were to make any (40man kara plx)
---
This is not true
---
&gt;who gives a fuck if it was a good game mechanic? 
---
Its a shit mechanic.
---
&gt;if you want all the classes to be equal then go play retail
---
I don't know where you got that statement from, but it certainly wasn't from me :)
---
In game, 100%
---
It's more fun with friends.   So be sure to go find a guild that shenanigans that you like.
---
Man I’d like this but at the same time I’m an adult child that sits with my feet in my chair 50% of the time.
---
Thats bullshit... people who want to rush will rush anyways...
---
I never got involved with realm forums on WoW, guess I was too young to care. But by the time Lord of the Rings Online came out I was in my trolling prime. And so was everyone else. The forum for my server Gladden looked like a broken unfinished mess. Topics with hundreds of posts but you could only see a dozen of them, people conversing seemingly with no one, out of context quotes and conversations, because people were constantly being banned or modded.  
---
Most of it because of the PvP mode. Being entirely realm based made it so personal. But it was a fun kind of personal. It was like professional wresting, with feuds, rivalries, faces, and heels. It never felt toxic though. People would be naturally upset if they lost or someone was better than them but I don't recall many instances of people going out of their way to deliberately grief others. So much goddamn fun  
---
By the time I got into WoW PvP it didn't feel like much of this could be possible, with the cross-realm queued battlegrounds and such. One big reason I'm looking forward to Classic
---
i love affliction but id rather play it how it was , lock utility always enough to get me in raids
---
This is the most boomer shit I've ever seen
---
Fully agree except your first sentence (Streamers)
---
Push up to AQ40 and go DS/Ruin. You will top the meters again.
---
You're talking about min-maxing to the highest point possible though.  A casual player doesn't need to do any of that.  When I'm subbed to retail I might flask but I basically never do anything else you're talking about.  I'm not even that casual of a player.
---
I agree grinding rep for pathfinder sucks.
---
Don't hate me, I actually like the Tortollian Seekers quests.
---

Love your art buddy! Keep it on 👍

I say it would be perfect for you just do not look any guides play it your way , I wish I was in your shoes my friend.
---
I'm dead serious, I started play about half way through classic and raided 3-5 time a week up until the end of cata. And since then I've been pretty much playing a few weeks just leveling up each expansion. Fixing shitty game interactions that was cause by limitations of our time is not breaking the classic experience. But hey I guess I'll play rogue or warrior instead of warlock cause thats the classic experience.
---
Not only that, but you'll piss off Priests by taking their shit.
---
Yeah it does. Don't you notice how he casts power world shield on himself and runs away to reset it after every break?
---
The gate from barrens to ashenvale.
---
Now you’re not in safe land any more.

Skinning+Herbalism or Skinning+Mining is the only way to level imao. Every other leveling combination is a rollplaying feel good distractng gold sink at best and a wasteful frustrating experience at worst.

Here is a summary copy/pasted from the Classic druid discord server (credit to Fike) 
---
"Regrowth - This build is focused on the symbiotic relationship of the improved regrowth and nature’s grace talents. You can consistently cast regrowths with the expectation of them to crit to proc nature’s grace for your next cast. Regrowth is very mana inefficient, so you must use down ranked regrowths to last the duration of the encounter and often cycle cheaper HT’s in your rotation as well.  Stacked with 5/8 T2 regrowth becomes one of the fastest heals in the game, making the Druid one of the strongest classes for keeping raid members alive, and the HoT left behind if always a good bonus for targets taking consistent damage.  Regrowth scales poorly with +healing which changing some stat values, crit% specifically gets a much higher weight while +healing drops a bit. A regrowth druid can push some of the highest HPS in the game, but it comes at the expense of extreme mana usage."
---
Here is a link: [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxf0xoZZxecocaV](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxf0xoZZxecocaV)
---
To add some more context - in Tier 1/2 content (especially on Alliance) you will deal with a good bit of heal sniping. Healers with fast, low efficiency (or high efficiency if you're a paladin) heals will snipe all the available healing as the content isn't that challenging and bosses should die pretty quickly if your raid has appropriate dps. Paladins and priests will flash away all the healing leaving druids (traditionally) with slow, efficient heals that can't land in time (HT R4), leaving druids on the bottom of the charts and creating the perception that druids are weak healers. This isn't true, of course, and this build adapts to that meta and allows you to pump sub-GCD downranked regrowths with over 50% crit. It basically leaves your hps on par or greater with flash healing priests which should justify you using innervate on yourself to compensate for the mana usage (they're burning mana too to keep up with paladins).
---
Later, as hp pools get deeper and damage gets more threatening in AQ/Naxx the power of HT R4 comes to the forefront as this type of healing scales extremely well, and too much damage goes out to be easily flashed away. In this damage environment HTs can actually land so it may be worthwhile to swap over to Moonglow at that point.

I don't like Undercity either. Way too cramped.

IDK how it works on the legion client
---
But in vanilla and on p servers from what I've seen it's just about the jankiest ability in the game
---
Expect weird things to happen when people are feared if it's gonna be anything like Vanilla or P servers.
---
'tis all about training, do you never play drum solos with your feet?
---
Umm, there was a difference between 1.8 and 1.12? Sorry for asking, but I‘m not a PvP expert ;)
---
It is viable to use evasion in rogue vs warrior matchup. You don’t wanna face tank over powers  with evasion on, but if he just used an ability or low on rage,  you can use it as a Chance to avoid SOME damage and may give you an opportunity to reset
---
Why is Priest ease of leveling a 5 or 7 out of 10? Just pick a number, like 6.
---
Also you didn't finish your sentence on that line. And I doubt they're harder to level than mages but your scale for all the classes is a bit wonky here so it doesn't matter anyway.
---
They are awesome for about 5 seconds. Then oom.
---
Not even kiddin
---
You like vanilla cause some dude who wanted to be viable had to switch to warrior cause of problems that could be easily fixed today which couldnt before? Cause that's the effect you're looking for people who would have liked to play lets say warlock will now play something else cause of these reasons.
---
Explain how a 5% intellect boost doesn’t matter in PVE?
---
WOW you got upset quick. The pedals themselfs are the delay. Also I doubt most people have the coordination to accurately hit these every single they need to when the fight comes down to seconds. Chill
---
Savory deviate delight makes u a human.
---
Yeah, Im not really talking about the set itself. It's more about how everyone knew everyone else and each guild knew each other and how far everyone/guild had gone had progressed. Status, rep, etc,etc.
---
my boy esfand with the solid moves, love that guy
---
Once fire becomes the best spec in AQ and Naxx mages are mostly limited by mana. Every bit of mana is basically a net damage buff. 5% doesn't seem that much but with evocation, 30% int regen during combat, blessing of kings it really can make a difference of having 2k extra mana to spend during a fight.
---
Anyone notice OP getting super upset at everyone who says these ain't a good idea.
---
Watching monkeynews is converting me to a gnome from nightelf.   I'll miss the frontflips
---
Imo the best thing about him is he is so open minded when he talks about stuff. It’s not like the usual hive mind mentality you see online like “I like classic therefor retail must suck” or the other way around.
---
He bit the blade lol
---
Real night time
---
Some keyboards have the F row closer than others.
---
If you start day one, I will guarantee you it's gonna be crazy to do any kind of profession, let alone gathering. The only thing remotely viable would be skinning, as everyone and their mother will farm ore nodes and herbs, because the prices will be incredibly high, for the first couple of weeks, if not first month.
---
Skinning is the only gathering profession, where the thing you gather respawn at a decent interval, when you have thousands of people in the same areas.
---
Yes there will be layering, but that's mainly to insure quests can still be done, and mostly aimed at mobs being there. Herbs and minerals respawn far slower then any regular mob, so good luck my friend lol.
---
There will be people doing nothing but this, to net hundreds of gold, during the first couple of months.
---
Warlock is a must in every single raid. Warlock also happens to be top 3 DPS in the game after a certain point.
---
You are yet another "i get all my info from forums" pro-change warrior.

---
Why is this here? If you have troubles killing any kind of mob, you should not be leveling, you should be grinding grey mobs for money to get better gear.
---
well, there are already addons for an enemy castbar in the beta, so this play won't work against good players, just like the hearthstone bait from shamans and druids. Which is a good thing imo.
---
So you're saying the extra travel time the pedals need to hit the switches is enough to hamper you?
---
Man I usually agree with a lot of the stuff you say, have you actually tried this type of pedals out and actually verified it at least semi scientifically?
---
That sounds like a good idea. Tbh I was thinking of doing the same thing, I’m just worried that pallys are boring as tits because they basically use autos as their main rotation. But apparently they get more complex at higher levels.
---
Sigh no im not, I'm a dude who played warlock in vanilla and tbc
---
It was VC when I started playing and I will continue to call it that.
---
Also VC refers to the quest "Van Cleef".
---
Exactly this
---
Do you plan on using an addon that reveals the map?
---
Yes. It's literally the best place to start.
---
My first thought was no, but then I realized it might actually be the best time to start. The best thing about classic was the adventure into the world, everything was new and exciting with things you have never seen before and everyone back then was new.
---
It’s a mixed back, gameplay wise it feels very dated in many aspects but if that isn’t an issue then there are so many things to experience and have fun with.
---
It's in reference to the "rush" at launch and not having mobs to kill.
---
Weirdly enough, I had the **exact** same thought. :D
---
AND GET OFF MY LAWN
---
The 20 points in balance aren't going to do a whole lot for you unless you can get a decent leather +dmg set together. And there's really only one decent leather +dmg set in the game, from AQ40. If you hodge podge a cloth set (and spell power trinkets) together I'm sure you can do some nice crits for a video or something, but you'll be pretty useless at actual pvp, any rogue/hunter/warrior will delete you.
---
i enjoyed this

I found Perplexity, Kron and Monkeynews to be pretty good with the info they brought.  I would rather have people test their misconception than ignore it.

I play with a 13" laptop and use a monitor. Kinda the best of both worlds IMHO. You get the portable benefit of a laptop but when you're at your own place you can just plug in the monitor to your laptop and have a desktop experience. In my case I have a MacBook Pro and I plug in a monitor via HDMI.

I played on a laptop without any monitor back in TBC-Cata and it was totally fine. But definitely a more elevated experience to just get a monitor and use that with said laptop. 👌👍
---
Way to fail at reading comprehension.
---
I would be very surprised if they reintroduce /follow in bgs since it was taken out as a way to prevent rudimentary honor farming bots, and not having it only really sucks if you need to afk at the start of AV lol

Omg this is nostalgia
---
And of course there is no other game in existence other than previous WoW expansions right? If only there were some fabled entity that 'developed new games', a 'game dev company' if you will. Guess we'll have to go back to watching these games we are discussing fall from the sky because nobody makes anything new.
---
What an utterly moronic statement. Of course there is a hypothetical game other than the ones that already exist, and its so bizarre to me that people can jump from 'I want to play a game that used to exist' to 'I never want new games to exist'. Thats why i call it spite, because its irrational and when you actually look at the argument you end up saying nonsensical shit like your comment

Yeah pre 1.8 it was almost impossible to attain pvp ranks 12-14, even with stacked brackets and premades farming 12 hours every single day for 12 weeks straight. 1.8 was "The percentage of players that may reach ranks 6 through 14 has been increased." Which made these ranks attainable by normal humans. Still very hard, but accessible.
---
I can agree on if they make post naxx content. That a lift would be okay since they would be able to balance the content around it. But they would have to somehow lock it to those raids only, and I am not sure if that's possible
---
Because when I see this expression, I get just a lil bit salty.
---
In Druid for server pop it's mentioned the expression : Jack of All Trades, Master of None.  The line finishes with : and oftentimes better than a master of one.
---
Just uhh yeah. Other than that, interesting and good tldr.
---
vanilla tanking life you get a parry you use revenge is misses you go in for a sunder armor to keep aggro it gets parried you lose aggro on the mob and taunt it resists it, you rage pop the aoe taunt.
---
this feels bad but it is a lot of bad luck and it is part of the design to give tanking a skill gap. on a similar note this is the reason blizzard was so hessitent to give tanks good AoE threat untill WotLK. (even in WotLK warriors were better group threat in the 2-7 mob range even over paladins if you knew how to proper tab target)
---
man it is going to be great once classic is out so i can use my full set of skills once again of aggro management constantly adjusting taunting while also moving mobs and LoSing stuff inorder to better group stuff up and assesing the healers mana to continue pulling or stoping. etc. etc.
---
no and no, only 1 spriest per raid and warlock only uses shadow bolt and 1 curse
---
This will 100% get you banned
---
You did? Then what's your point, because all i get from this thread is "warlock isnt viable". Or you are upset that you should spam shadowbols and curses instead of dots?
---
Um yea, welcome to vanilla which you claim you played. Dumb rules like these are all over the game, maybe we should change all of them.
---
Yeah vanilla shaman is it’s own beast, you’ll have to roll horde if you want that shaman experience.
---
Honor wasn't changed again after 1.8 until the TBC pre-patch. There is no difference.
---
Also, the Honor system won't be in the game at launch. It comes with Phase 3 (BWL).
---
Everything in the game is at 1.12. Some content will be time-gated is all.
---
I'm a ret paladin main since Cata. I wanna ideally play paladin in Classic to see what it's like... I quite enjoyed the stress test despite its slowness, however I'm well aware 5 levels obviously aren't indicative of how the other 55 will be. Is it really that bad?
---
You pvp in plate
---
You pve in a dress cuz armor is uselsss in that context
---
IDK the details but most fo the end game pieces seem to only have so much stat allocation. So armor is always going to take away from more relevant PvE stats. It needs to be very well itemized for paladin to get around that. 
---
Obviously it does happen sometimes. But without progressive itemization on tier gear it's going to be very rare.
---
another retail baby crying about MUHH QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES lol
---
what dose boomer mean, I'm from the congo
---
2k extra? It's 5% man
---
and if you oom as mage you are a shit mage
---
ive seen multiple paladins say they healed in the pladin tier sets
---
like the paladins in most raids will be healing and the cloth classes will want the cloth so you have to do something with the plate tier sets
---
i plan to heal ill just wear plate till it matters more maybe around aq 40, but i def want to wear tier 2 and 2.5.
---
It was a joke
---
So the original WoW is designed for the casual audience.  Every (non elite, non endgame) quest in the game is intended to be done in a half hour.  I understand this was a metric the quest team had during development, from a friend who worked on WoW at that time.  They intentionally broke down large epic multi step quests into individual quests that comprised a large epic questline.  To make it more digestible for players how played 30 - 2 hours once a week.
---
Honestly almost any kind of PvE content has only become more difficult than back then. 
---
A high mythic+ or mythic raid requires many times more planning and coordination than anything vanilla has to offer, also classes are tougher to play at the same time.
---
You list engineering as "very expensive" to level. It's a pretty easy &amp; inexpensive prof to level.
---
I've got the f keys reserved for those skills. And like all of the regular numbers..shift...ctrl
---
..alt...mouse wheel... and a bunch of letters lmfao.
---
Int is the weakest stat for mages, you shouldn't oom and you need 59 int for 1% crit.
---
Obviously it matters, but saying it's important is like saying picking dwarf over gnome is important because at 60 they have a couple more strength from base stats. That's the kind of difference we are talking.
---
Hahahahaha I'm 6'4 with massive hands
---
this video needs more frost mages.
---
OMG! Thanks! Now I must know which server kungen Will be settled
---
I actually have a three-button foot pedal for work, it's USB, but I can rarely get it to in any game.
---
Really not want to burst your bubble mate but that's because the game is bad.
---
Yeah Im a hordie and I have a small group of close friends that will play with me but just playing with them limits my experience. I'll be looking for the same things you are.  
---
Here is one  I've seen mentioned: [https://www.reddit.com/r/workingadultsguild/comments/ah3en2/welcome\_guild\_introduction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/workingadultsguild/comments/ah3en2/welcome_guild_introduction/)
---
&gt;Couple points (mostly from The Prophecy of C'Thun):
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* C'Thun was thought dead, not imprisoned. He may or may not have killed a Titan in this battle. It wasn't until the Chronicle novels in 2016 that they ret-conned this.
---
Well AQ is a former titanic facility full of corrupted former guards (titan-forged). None of that makes sense if they thought him dead. Outside of the "prophecy of cthun" everything else ive read and seen suggests he was imprisoned just like the other gods.
---
&gt;* C'Thun didn't have a name until the Qiraji he created gave him one.
---
For presentations sake, referring to him as the only name hes ever had seems fair to me.
---
&gt;* The Red, Blue, and Green dragonflights had to help in creating the sealed wall.
---
And the War of the Shifting Sands as well. A supplemental detail i suppose.
---
&gt;Also, why the reupload?
---
Made the name more concise shortly after upload. Thanks for taking the time to watch, hope you found it worthwhile man.
---
Does it's give you more real estate or cap your zoom out value and crop off the top/bottom?
---
If it doesn't that seems pretty freaking amazing...
---
About 30 seconds slower than the record of 45.06 seconds.
---
And people think raids won't be a challenge in 2019.
---
I don't understand why anyone cares about steamers.
---
If Classic is anything like Vanilla wow was, they're going to be a huge PvP Target for bored PvPers.
---
[No. Money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LLS9ZwRo3k)
---
Hunters benefit especially well from engineering, and not just because of goggles.
---
That said, it's hardly required.  Herbs will always sell well and someone needs to skin the core hounds.
---
It's fine.
---
If you are not working for Blizzard and on Warden. How can you make an absolutely certain claim like that? Many used it for years without getting banned. Sure it might be a chance. But saying it's 100%, is just not true.
---
You mean zoned world pvp or actual free roaming pvp?
---
Parent here will mostly be playing on weekends and later at night while everyone’s asleep. I’d love to be apart of the guild, going Horde as well. PM me, I think I’ll be dps if that matters. I did like tanning in tBC and Wrath so I may try in classic eventually. Strength!
---
You're a legend now. Just thought I'd inform you.
---
Idk, watching Esfand doing PvP it looks pretty fun.
---
Nope it’s almost entirely time investment. You can speed it up by having a good premade group but they’ll usually be comprised of hardcore rankers going for the double digit ranks.
---
That was a pretty bad mage
---
are you expecting people on the wow classic sub to say anything other than yes?
---
they have recently started handing out temp bans for this
---
I think I'd actually call that exactly messing around.
---
The razor blades are very capable and very well designed. If you watch some reviews on YouTube they show what exceptional cooking they have for their thinness.
---
Don't give WoD too much credit
---
Happy to hear it man, thanks for giving it a shot.
---
Thanks for doing this. I mean we already had [this one with 18,500 responses](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/), but I'm sure this one with 88 responses will really help too.

What's there to elaborate? Tauren is the worst choice for the 4 available classes it can chose.

This particular Druid isn't great at PvP, so I wouldn't show this video to hype people up for Druid. 
---
But I do agree that Druids are really great in PvP
---
Why not just macro stance depended abilities? Like use berserker stance and WW as the same button?
---
Never oom.  Spam instant heal, properly done can be really op.  Buffing everyone is a big pain in the d.
---
This. While I don't get the hate for streamers, just kill them? Form groups, gank them, whatever. Habe fun and play your game.
---
Too comment.
---
Anyone notice how upset you got enough to write this ?
---
There was "tiny" change to it that came in 1.8 though, I mentioned it in my reply to another comment, that makes the system better. I'm just curious if they're starting with that change in place is all.
---
2000's trance.
---
As others have said, there isn't much "farming" for consumables for any of those classes.  You do need reagents for group-wide buffs, but at end-game that cost is negligible, so long as you have some way of making a little gold.
---
Paladins are hands down the best PVP healers in Classic.  Priests and Shaman have their place and are totally viable, mind you, but if you play Horde you will hear incessant bitching about killing paladins.  Priest and Paladins are very good pocket healers and if you make a warrior friend they will love you long time.  Shaman are still capable, but are better supporting a group than being a pocket healer.
---
Yes, there's definitely a place for you. However, as a casual, most people will still expect you to get proper enchants, most consumables and trying to get your character geared for raiding. It really depends if you're the kinda casual who's just not playing a lot, but still do your homework on gear/enchants/mechanics/tactics and so forth for raiding. If you are, you'll be fine. If you don't at least try a little bit to do these things, you'll probably have a harder time, since the average player is much better and more knowledgeable about the game, and the current 'meta' in gaming, even for many casuals, is to read up on guides and at least try a little bit to be competitive in terms of gearing and so forth.
---
pedals actually add a lot of delay because of the travel and reaction time. Your hand react a lot faster and has a shorter distance.
---
And yes, the delay can be your death or a huge dps loss
---
I do have cause for killing red. It’s beCAUSE I hate them.
---
When would a human get to use it against shadowmeld?  I can’t remember if BGs sometimes queued you ally vs ally or not, but I think that was later in the game.
---
Open world pvp. They have it so follow works up until you engage in any world pvp and for like 5-10 seconds afterwards. 
---
They introduced that system with the whole war mode toggle in the bfa pre patch.
---
how is red = dead toxic? youre playing on a pvp server. if you dont want pvp play on a pve server instead, its that simple
---
Have you tried joy2key
---
Omar is actually my godfather!!11! (I’m literally just replying to everything now just for the downvotes;-))
---
Holy fuck I might need to step my game up.
---
See what I did there?
---
Wait is this real? Does it actually work. I will order one ASAP for when I get around to leveling a warrior.
---
not always, some people use em for other reasons than being legs no worky mcgee
---
They need to feel the true vanilla experience
---
You will get no mercy from my skilled undead ninja rogue Stabbybackz, I might even laugh at your corpse while I include you in my pvp video I made in fraps.
---
You can get away with not wearing the dress... people cleared this content 15 years ago preferring Tier gear and ignoring Min/Max bullshit. 
---
Then again go for it - you, all the druids and priests can roll on the dress and I'll rock that sweet Tier 2 happily.
---
Ahn'Qiraj was built by the titan-forged over C'Thun's supposed corpse. It wasn't a prison, it was a city used to protect Titan lore repositories and machinery. Unless you use post-Vanilla sources and mainly the novels, this is the true story.
---
Please just look at the rogue talent tree and you’ll see what he means
---
That's... Actually functionally awesome lol
---
Wow, retail actually looks pretty good. They did a nice job with upgrading the graphics.
---
1.12 version.
---
It just takes practice. I don’t plan on using skills that require rolling globals with (accounting for latency and tapping it to the next cast before it’s shown)
---
Push to talk or other less gcd sensitive skills will be fine for this. Macros .
---
There are down sides to this, yes, but my god it also has a upside.
---
Did you ever play on a server that died? I did in vanilla. The only thing preventing me from playing the game, was the ability to change realm. 
---
And now with the steamer culture, one person can effectively kill off an entire server, just by stopping the streams or switching to another game and having hundreds, if not thousands of followers, do the same. 
---
Having one guild transfer realm can actually be a good thiing as well, it leaves room for new people to climb and claim awesomeness
---
We absolutely need to be able to move realm, at a cost ofc, to keep it from being to prevelent.
---
&gt; Its a shit mechanic.
---
To be perfectly honest, this is vanilla wow in a nutshell. If you start tackling every shit mechanic you end up with not classic wow. Which is why people are so adamant about no changes. You make one change and it sparks a new discussion.
---
Dagger is 100% viable in PVE, its just another style of play.
---
In a locked folder in the trash, i still have ptsd from the same songs on the radio over and over
---
I made a written [1-60 alliance leveling guide](https://sage-guide.netlify.com). It has a lot of useful features. Check it out.
---
I like Xaryu
---
It's not that simple. 5% extra in Naxx gear is like 500 extra mana. 2 evocations in a long fight is twice 300-400 extra mana. With mage armour you'll regen more mana. 40 extra int is also 1% extra crit and crits also give you mana back so yeah, during a 10min fight 2k mana isn't too farfetched. 
---
And AQ and Naxx raiding was all about mana management as a mage. Scorch wasn't solely used to keep ignites rolling, it was used because it was sustainable, but fireball was superior dps and used during cooldowns to get those big ignites, so more mana means more fireballs instead of scorches resulting in more damage but draining your mana faster than anything, even with mana tide and innervates you'd be able to go through your mana in no time.
---
Druids can actually be SHIT in Pvp
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMSrqrJs1CY
---
Clearly a unbiased sample of the strength of druids
---
New player here: where do you get the client(launcher) to even see if you somehow get the beta. Not saying there’s a chance I will, but I can at least be optimistic
---
 Test of Lore?
---
What are personal demands towards the system? Do you need a stable 60fps at all times? Are you willing to sacrifice visuals for performance? What other games do plan on playing?
---
If we are just talking about Classic, the Blade 15 base model will be more than enough. My PC isn't even half as powerful, and I still get a rocksolid 120fps @ 4k (in classic graphics mode of course).
---
This guy wanted wow tokens in classic
---
First of all, it’s WoW not WOW
---
Im not using the pedals to stance dance but if you used it for things like sinister strike then yeah you’re right . If you use it for less gcd tight skills it’s useful imo
---
Yes, more players will reach ranks 6 through 14 and lower-level players will get more honor than they did before 1.8.
---
Nothing in the game will be as it was before 1.12.
---
I use a single pedal for my vent bind, shrug.
---
Ahh I see. That sounds like a great idea tbh.
---
Low quality, trash meme. Low quality, trash poster.
---
In a word, yes.
---
In two words, hell yes.
---
Any links/sources? I'm genuinely interested.
---
It was a white item usable by levels 20 and above in Patch 1.12.1. Not 2.0
---
Something fucky is going on for sure. He literally gets both the buff and the flag shows up on his back briefly. For sure a wtf moment.
---
I’ve never started there so I can’t compare but I totally want that nostalgia hit and NE was my first character (I started in 2006 and only ever had a NE rogue that I got to 20 and then ditched it for a warrior that I took to 86).
---
It might sound stupid but it was playing the NE starter zone music at work the other day that sold me in Classic. Only reason I’m not just playing NE is cause (please don’t hate me!) I think end game warrior gear looks dump on a Nelf in Classic
---
I thought about this years ago but never put it into practice!! This is so cool!
---
Warlocks get progessively better as time goes on idk what your talking about?
---
fuck the tos. pservers are a good reason we're getting classic. btw with that toxicity enjoy playing alone on release
---
Dude...
---
Man, I love old WoW videos.   I remember when this came out.
---
My brother and I and two of our friends are  all taking a good chunk of time off. We aren’t  super hard grinders, so I think we will end up somewhere in the low 50’s
---
They've talked about this in a dev Q&amp;A. There was a lighting engine change (I believe it was the Cata patch) which made it so that the shadowed areas of the game (under trees, etc) were way too dark, and to fix it they increased the brightness everywhere.
---
They've since been going back and hand correcting and adjusting zones (I think Org, SW, and Elwynn forest were some of the first) to where we are now with BfA.
---
Have you tried posting this on blizzard forums? In the hopes of a blue reply?
---
Yeah, that’s why I put “also wrong” in parentheses after, because I’ve since learned it still mitigates a lot of the damage because Overpower has a cooldown, so it’s not like the warrior will be able to spam overpower - you’ll still be dodging MOST of the attacks (just less than against other melee classes).
---
The stars aligned my friend!
---
Likely will out damage the mage on bosses, but will come way behind on trash mobs.
---
Bad druid player chases even worse mage player until he's OOM, news at 11.

---
Shit, lets go into how dumb seal twisting is.
---
How does it work:  
---
Seal twisting works because of a combination of gimmicks, in that A) abilities can be used 'after-cast' and still effect the cast.  (see: Divine Favor, Arcane Power, Use:Trinkets) and B) Seal of Command is a script run on melee swing.  Since SoC is a script, it has a next-tick delay, and we can see the effect being triggered before it happens.  This then allows a new seal to be applied in the swing-tick, so that its effect also happens due to (A)'s effect.
---
For this to work, Seal of Command must be up for each swing, or you lose DPS.  The reason why TBC seal twisting was less shit, was because Seal of Blood was not bad, and did not require you re-seal to Command.  The real twist was:  
---
Seal of Command -&gt; Swing -&gt; Proc -&gt; Seal of Blood -&gt; Judge -&gt; Seal of Command.  
---
Seal of Blood worked because 48% extra damage was more or less equal with Command, which had a PPM based attack, roughly ~50%@70%, or 35% extra damage, scaling up with haste.
---
So when you get down to the real details.  Seal twisting was because of Seal of Blood, not Seal of Command.  
---
Seal of Righteousness does not out-dps Seal of Command, which is a requirement of Seal Twisting.
---
Yeah you’ll be ahead of the curve. I’m not a super hard grinder but I’m hoping to at least get to 50 during my time off
---
Everyone get a load of this fuckin' savant.
---
The debuff cap is a bit different because it was entirely a technical limitation that nobody at blizzard wanted.
---
The rest of the mechanics in vanilla, at least as far as I am concerned are great, sure a lot of them are quite plain but it keeps all the classes much more unique than in any other iteration of the game, so its a good thing.
---
ITT a bunch of tilted nerds.
---
Yep, then, it‘s the 1.12 version ;)
---
Engineering doesn't require much outside of resources you can gather from just mining.  You can be damn near self-sufficient with just mining.  At 300 engineering you can make some solid cash by making and selling thorium shells and scopes - especially before AV becomes available (Ice threaded shells/arrows are very close in DPS to thorium, and much less expensive).
---
You're repeating the same stuff everyone is. Yea we get it, we agree that flying killed interaction. 
---
But have you thought WHY it did exactly? And perhaps what could have been done better?
---
I don't like to think  any one mechanic or idea is inherently bad, sometimes they're just poorly implemented. I'm mainly talking about MMOs in general, flying is often poorly implemented, even FF14 has the same issue.
---
I'm asking these questions to see if maybe somehow an MMO in the future (not classic), could have flying in a way that would not kill the sense of interaction that you get on the ground. 
---
If say flying was only a few feet or yards above the ground, would it really be any different than a ground mount with the exception of it letting you glide over water?   
---
Flying does sound like a really cool idea, and because it sounds cool people asked for it originally. There were some unforeseen consequences of implementing what amounts to flying cars with limitless fuel (hence OP). We can do better and maybe find a way to have flying without it killing interaction.
---
I wanted to play horde shaman. Guild is going alliance, so I'll be going nelf druid instead.
---
See, i find a contradiction. The amount of posts in Livestreamfails would say that you were not old enough to maintain a vanilla raiding schedule when it was current content.
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but warlock dps was kinda on the low side in comparison to a frost mage or even fire dependent on the situation mainly cause of the negetive effects cap.
---
Are world bosses going to be tethered, or will we still be able to kite Kazzak to capitol cities?
---
1. Enh doesn't do 60% of a fury warrior's damage in a raid.
---
2. 20% chance of a white MH hit every 3 seconds is not significant compared to another pure DPS. Most of that damage doesn't even come from the white damage itself, it comes from rage generation. If you have rogues in the party it's even worse.
---
This is what i WANTED to hear, thanks

Calling other people on the internet children is definitely a sign of maturity on your own end buckaroo. Stick to fortnite
---
Different strokes for different folks but this just feels like cheating
---
In that case it will probably work fine, but I just assumed stances due to picture.
---
Depends if you prefer to just fuck around and have fun, or if you want to be competitive.  If the former, go druid.  That class is a ton of overall fun.  If the latter, I wouldnt recommend warrior since it will take forever to level and gear properly.  I would suggest hunter or lock if you're casual, otherwise rogue if you're not interested in those.
---
Ohh, okay I see what you were saying now :)  yeah that’s pretty much spot on. It’s always good to get the information out there
---
Honestly, if you are going casual, you can easily find another casual guild that would take any of the three. 
---
It sounds, to me, like a druid would be best for you.
---
Who was that guy
---
This is a great guide. However, lots of info, not the opinions mind you, are wrong. Might want to double check.
---
Ghost wolf is lv 20 and windfury is 30, for example.
---
Actually not minimal at all... https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7zluy0/how_night_brightness_has_changed_in_wow_from_335/

The old wintersaber farm was not capped by days. You simply have 2 quest You can repeat agian and again. At exhalted You get the option to buy the wintersaber for the exact same price as the other racial epic mounts. Oh and You obvioiusly need tiger ridibg skill.
---
No, I kinda lost faith in humanity after posting about it here and everyone was like "stfu it doesn't matter retard."
---
I respect that. I’ll take my time with a couple of my alts. I just want one character at max level to support/bank roll my alts.
---
Asmon caters to a younger, autistic toxic audience. If that's you're level of entertainment then great.
---
Calling the AV mount free is kinda ridiculus
---
I'm sure you could just assign them to ctrl, shift, and ctrl+shift or whatever other modifier you wanted. If they're not customizable then they're useless.
---
The buffed the fuck out of the armor bonus in bear form. Prior to that they were completely non-viable.
---
Yeah that part sucks. :(
---
It's more a grind than actually being good at the game, as long as your group is good enough to win consistently over randoms all the time. 
---
The odd proper premade vs. premade is obviously a skill/gear/composition matchup, but those premade vs. premade games are usually not that important other than for bragging rights, since most of your honor comes from winning against small groups of friends which isn't enough to make a full premade and/or randoms joining BGs. 
---
Obviously being good at the game is a requirement for the top premades out there, since they want to have an edge against all the other premades, because when they do get matched up against another proper premade, winning against them will increase/decrease the honor gap between those people and it could make sure they get ahead of the other group, unless what most premades on private servers do, where they're put into bracket and it's coordinated who's getting rank 14 every week, so you don't get more honor than the guy ranking to 14.
---
I would say you can 'easily' rank to 10-11 by joining random 'bad' premades and just joining random BGs, as long as you consistently from week to week. At 12 and up, it pretty much requires you to invest so much time into it that you need consistent wins, which you won't get in random premades and joining random BGs alone. Hope this helps!
---
Patchwerk from Naxxramas.
---
I remember watching this when I was like 13-14.
---
&gt; But have you thought WHY it did exactly?

I literally just wrote 3-4 points in a giant paragraph as to why lmao.

And i gave my opinions on why it cant be done, please tell me a good way to implement it instead then?
---
&gt;I'm asking these questions to see if maybe somehow an MMO in the future (not classic), could have flying in a way that would not kill the sense of interaction that you get on the ground.
---
You literally cant add flying in the way you want in any way without ruining the world. Literally 0 ways in my mind you can fix it no matter how you do it. Thats what i said, there is literally no way at all.
---
&gt;If say flying was only a few feet or yards above the ground, would it really be any different than a ground mount with the exception of it letting you glide over water?
---
But this is not flying then? This is gliding or w/e, and thats just normal ground mounts so whats the difference.
---
&gt;Flying does sound like a really cool idea
---
Sounds cool yeah, but we now know it doesent work.
---
&gt;unforeseen consequences of implementing what amounts to flying cars with limitless fuel
---
I gave my reasoning as to why "fuel" would not work, its still flying? But flying with more annoying stuff.
---
Definitely the former - preciate it I'm pretty excited to play druid
---
The salt is real xD  
---
Still no beta? :p  
---
Joking aside, that guy really peaked early, time is a cruel mistress :p
---
Guess im going with the retcon then. The prophey of Cthun scarab lord quest text is the first ive ever heard that he was even thought dead tbh.
---
TD - The Deadmines
---
He kill people or just chill?
---
They are actually about even in PvE. The 5% spirit boost with the arcane talent that gives you regen in combat will net you about the same if not an extra free cast as with gnome. You lose a but of crit sure but it's vanilla. Enjoy what you look like over 0.2% damage cause nobody gives a shit if your top damage for mages except for you.
---
Landro Longshot did NOT appear in the game until patch 2.0.1. There was literally no way to redeem the codes until then.
---
Why charge? Everyone knows warriors 4th stance is sitting 4 eating
---
YTMND
---
Thanks man - I'm pretty excited to play druid
---
My e-mail took just over 24 hours to arrive.
---
i use them for raid markers
---
Creepy.
---
The -6% to be crit on druids is a TBC talent not vanilla. It is the biggest issue for druid tanks in vanilla that they can not become crit immune.
---
Try Irfanview. Never failed me. That or gimp.
---
I recommend his Classic WoW memories on Youtube! They're hilarious, especially the first two episodes
---
Lack of mana I guess
---
I would give it a shot. I see the same opinions upvoted one day then shit on the next here. People are sheep. Give examples of why the gear will be op like you did comparing mage t1+2 with the upgraded r13 set. Maybe someone will notice.
---
Something like 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssbMDkIVMck
---
literally 24/7
---
It's definitely unoptimal.
---
But hey, it probably works I guess.
---
Sorry that the dude didn't keep doing research on classic after tbc came out. He's a legend it's been over 14 years since he's played or cared about vanilla cut him some slack not everyone a turbo nerd min/maxer who has to know everything about classic. He's having fun in all these clips and relearning the game.  stop acting like he didn't get r14 in the original vanilla.
---
As someone in a wheelchair, I’m offended by this comparison.
---
On a rogue when the cheap shot resists, 4-5 point kidney resists, and then gouge gets dodged is my favourite
---
id guess more for mana managment reasons, maybe a lower rank is more efficient
---
FuriousPaul haha, his guide for horde leveling is so in depth and well done
---
There was a lot of dead level 1-5s
---
I think this would be kinda bad for stance dancing but maybe that's just me. I think this would be great for an oh shit button or PTT though.
---
Came here to say this
---
Hah too true
---
No, he's just funny. No need to get so mad lol
---
Is there a blue post about the test next week
---
Mana reasons.
---
I can tell there's no point in arguing with you.
---
They've been handing out bans for tmorph for a long time
---
YES
---
Yes - though I forgot today was Sunday, so “this week” is more accurate :) 
---
I’ve been playing WoW on and off ever since release and I’ve been a mage main all that time, but vanilla mage is so god damn f’ing boring to play sadly.
---
I think I’ll go rogue since I was always a huge fan of Nogg Aholic and World of Roguecraft where they played rogues.
---
Everything else is 1.12 but this one thing they decided should be 1.8.
---
I know this is late but here ya go:
---
Class: I'd go with druid or Mage to be honest. They are both pretty dang good for pvp but Mages def hold the edge (that would be my top recommendation)
---
Race: Druid...well either horde or alliance you're kinda stuck with either NE or Tauren but for Mage WoTF is a great pvp racial with Undead and escape artist for gnomes.
---
Professions: leveling up? Just get gathering professions to earn some cash if you want to do it that way and def get engineering for level 60 PvP
---
cool
---
That’s painful to watch. Spam moonfire, no feral charge (not picked? Seriously?) running after the hunter for decades, not using los... that was bad... terrible even
---
Hahaha true!
---
Yeahh!, that would have been awesome, a buff from sitting at a campfire and there would just be a small glow around you, you could say there’s just a lamp on your hip or something, wouldn’t even have to model it, my brain will just imagine it there and not even question it lol.
---
At that rate it will take you about 3 months to hit 60.
---
Hell yeah man, just a little bit longer of a wait!
---
Or use a looper / any guitar pedals.. specifically a looper because you need precision timing.
---
Tbh most people are just going to buy gold anyways. I wouldn't want wow tokens but still going to buy gold.
---
These seem useless. Why the hell would I want to move my entire leg for a hotkey lol?
---
That said, I could see these being useful for the physically disabled.
---
Fine no one said it directly but you know what I mean... The comment above mine implies it heavily. 
---
 " . If you're trying to be sneaky, it makes sense to keep your movement limited and "glide" (not literally) across the ground. "
---
This. Moving your entire leg for a hotkey is just stupid
---
It’s called smart pivot and its toggle able
---
No, this is Patrick
---
I’m hoping I’ll be able to at least do level 40! Should be able to get about 30-40 hours played time in over the week !
---
Definitely great for novelty or super casual player, too slow for serious gaming
---
First he killed and then he chilled
---
Well said
---
Try to immediatly socialize with people and you will have a good time. Tho with two hours available a day expect it to take 1-2 months for Level 60. On beta i reached Level 20 with a mage in 1 day played time (and that is very slow)
---
Very nice. He part of a quest or something ? I am so curious
---
Feel like people are drinking kool-aids here or have some odd definition of casual. OP specifically stated he loves playing solo, and that is a dead end path for classic. At best he can pug scholomance/ubrs/dm for some blue crap while all the hard raiders have 10x of his dps and a geared warrior will kill him under charge stun.
---
The short answer is that if you plan to be in a hard-core try-hard guild, they will probably require that you have engineering.
---
That said, there are plenty of guilds that have cleared Naxx40 and plenty of Grand Marshals/High Warlords that don't rely on engineering.
---
I'm sure the MMO mouse, mechanical keyboard, massive rig, and 27" monitor wouldn't throw her off first.
---
I think I recall maybe 1 or 2 defence leather items but I think most came from rings and tickets.  Had the heavy dark iron ring from MC.
---
I respect this. Id toss in some storm peaks music
---
Considering most fights are over in less than 20-30 seconds there wouldn't be much to watch. It would be like watching football but immidiately after the first down the game ends.
---
For anyone not in the know; World of Roguecraft was released in reverse order, starting with 3, then 2 and finally 1. So if you haven't seen it or want to see it in chronological order, it's 321.
---
2-3 month is not that long time :D i expected more 
---
so i will have opportunity to do full content even with not hardcore, casual gameplay?
---
I fall asleep to MadSeason almost daily lmao
---
Its not about input lag, its about actuation time. A finger keybind is just going to be faster.
---
If I had spare cash, I'd probably get a foot switch for something like push to talk, or some other non-combat related keybind. Its definitely useful, but I don't think I'd use this for stance dancing.
---
You serious? esports?
---
This is a bad place to ask that if you're looking for a legitimate answer as it's a huge pro-Classic echo chamber. Retail isn't bad and Classic isn't superior, they're different games that cater to different audiences.
---
It really depends on what kind of games you enjoy, Classic isn't for everybody and a lot of people aren't going to like how slow and grindy the game is. Retail wow is much more userfriendly and faster paced.
---
&gt; I know classic will be 1.12 for everything else, 
---
mount system wont be 1.12 either afaik
---
A god amongst men, bow for this master Warlock, my brethren!
---
Rotate it?
---
The rogue rotation is sinister strike + keep slice and dice up.
---
i'm gonna kick some triplets into my rotation, hell yeah
---
I mean some people maybe have one leg that doesn’t work, have a movement impairment that makes it hard to actually stand and stay stable, or they can move their legs but can’t support their weight
---
Shimmering Flats was a hotbed for ganking though with Gadgetzan just 20 seconds away.
---
Probably Thrash, it's an ability lots of mobs have including some bosses.
---
Ppl buying gold illegally &gt; wow tokens for everyone
---
You can't allow people to do it, if they have to, there should be risks of ban / getting hacked etc.
---
That is only true in MC and some BWL fights.
---
But PvP in Classic would be way more fun to watch. Maybe BG tournaments.
---
Go warlock if you care about raiding at all. The entire point of taking a spriest to a raid is to buff the warlock's damage in vanilla.
---
You'll get an email a few hours after you've received access. But you can manually check by opening the Blizzard launcher, clicking World of Warcraft, and then at the bottom above the play button it has a drop down box and it will say "Beta" or "Beta &amp; Stress"
---
That laptop could pretty much run anything at 1080p out right now at pretty good settings. It should have no problems without classic at all.
---
PVP servers will likely attract more players, and therefore more raiding guilds.  Blizzard has already stated they are going to allow paid character transfers on Classic, so worst case you can transfer to get to the raiding scene.
---
I’m gonna listen to the same music I listen to now because I actually like this game and I’m not just here to try and relive my early teens.
---
It's almost like you have to have some level of skill and classes dont play themselves.
---
27” monitor? What is this? Amateur hour?
---
The Hinterlands for me. cool questline and rewards. Good to make Gold.
---
Even more worth it than for those with wow experience. Those replaying are returning to a loved world and story they thought lost forever, but going back is never quite as good as experiencing it for the first time.
---
If I join this as my first WoW experience, will a bunch of minmaxer clans ruin the server experience for me?
---
you will get 1 shot from raiders if you don't participate the 40 man grinding, solo players is a dead end path for classic. There's not a single patch that would allow you to progress on gear, everything is available only to 40 man raid contents
---
Inb4 you get a lot of irrationally salty druid haters. They seem to be rampant in this sub
---
Big blue 👗
---
obviously. when it first came out no one had experience??? and this is emulating that. weird question with an obvious answer
---
My friend used that on his Paladin and I used it on my Warrior a couple of times when I visited him, it's okay but it's best used for other stuff like P2Talk button and binds that doesn't require lightning fast reflexes. Also macros are best used for stance dancing
---
Personally I prefer macros stance because fingers have much more dexterity and you need that to play a Warrior like a boss.
---
Spriest is not good in dungeons. They run oom very quickly, have a poor CC, low range, have no AOE at all and generate a lot of threat for no reason. I mean generally it doesn't matter because you can 4 man any dungeon fine, but really even an enhance/ret/feral is more useful than a spriest in dungeons.
---
Yeah. the retcon didn't happen until March of 2016 with the release of  *World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 1*, which was after all the content of Warlords of Draenor and just before Legion.
---
I mean look at him, he’s a roided up beast!
---
don't spoil the secret!
---
As someone who plays BfA and is super excited for classic you perfectly summarized my feelings towards everything. Well done.
---
Yeah! Im loving watching duels etc, sure they can be pretty quick but i actually understand whats going on
---
You're looking at the average person hitting 60 in 10 days /played. 6 days is considered pretty fast and 15 is super casual. So plan on 240 hours unless you're really hammering at it.
---
Not having IRL friends that play isn't relevant. You'll run into plenty of people in game that will quest with you for hours if you're on the same quest lines as them. It's always good to have some help.
---
Sorry I meant to type 37"***
---
That dude is terrible, but hunters are one of the worst matchups for droods
---
Gnome caster will give you ptsd over line of sight issues from dirt on the floor.  Gnome melee is hot though.
---
I won't roll a priest then because I've never enjoyed healing as much. I'm going to try rogue today on a private server. 
---
Is there a better forum for classic PvP? 
---
I agree though, I read a few threads here on the best racials for rogue and "play what your heart tells you" is a lame non-answer.
---
GMs spawned him in during stress test
---
Oh damn you are the coolest guy ive ever met holy fuck dude
---
You gotta be kidding me.
---
This guy's voice is really monotonous.
---
spriest should heal in dungeons, that's actually really easy and not worse than proper healing spec if done right
---
Yeah I know and it is indeed Trash, you can see the combat log in the video.
---
There are more buttons in classic PvP, I'm pretty sure. Spell rankings plus no spells locked behind spec walls(I mean you can't have some very low tree skills in multiple specs, but in general you have access to all specs at all times is what I mean.)
---
I played because of peer pressure from some clan mates. It was right after release. I rolled NE Druid and by the time I got to Darnassus he had met me there. There apparently was a low level raid of about 4 or 5 hordies mid 40's. He was a gnome mage. I laughed because I thought he was going to die to them. He was level 60. He killed them all. He frost Nova to Blizzard and started wiping them quick. I sat there in literal amazement.... I was instantly hooked. Damn what a time in life....
---
Im pretty keen for TBC and LK reliving, when it comes to Blizzard actually creating from scratch - I honestly don’t believe they “got it” anymore.
---
Also reading comments on this post / sub I don’t think the community knows what it wants either. Just vague ideas.
---
Classic is coming right when I go back to college soooo no.
---
No. The best way is to show your dissatisfaction by posting on the official forums.
---
Posting on a unofficial subreddit won't change anything probably :P
---
But I agree, the nights are way too bright.
---
Then you would know that every class in Vanilla was limited in their toolsets they could use in raids so therefore no class would be viable by your logic. That included Warriors as in your bad example of people supposedly switching to Warriors because Warlocks were “useless”.
---
I was talking about pvp. I really don't want an esport to be made out of classic because m+ is the reason all modern WoW expansions have linear dungeons, just to cater to the stupid esports scene.
---
OFC! Started my first WoW-journey on a private server one year ago and Im hooked, never looking back
---
I used to yell that when stance dancing in vanilla.
---
Thanks for the update. I remember them being fine but didn't play one, and they were pretty rare. I'd like to hear more opinions.
---
Overpower actually hits... but doesn’t crit:
---
Me: D:
---
But then players who didn’t experience the initial expansions wouldn’t actually be playing the Classic version, they’d be playing a complete remaster..
---
Never played vanilla yet you have beta access?
---
Funny all you neckbeards chime in to tell me I'm wrong, but not one of you has a suggestion of what is actually happening. Picking up a flag is a spell/action. If the batch that he picked the flag up in hasn't registered with the server before the opponent turns in the flag, the actions will happen simultaneously. This somehow resulted in the flag turn in getting priority. I'm not claiming to be an expert on spell batching or can say that this 100% is the problem, but logically it makes sense. Please correct me if you have a better explanation of whats going on.
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
That’s a lot of pics to individually open and correct. After doing 5 I would start to lose my mind knowing there’s gotta be a better way lol.
---
&gt;highly devoleloped fleshed out version of wow
---
We're not talking about BfA, right?
---
Moonglow is always fun, if you can get some spell power balance with feral charge is my favorite. Forget what that other guy said really the only problem you will be having is hunters IMO.
---
Blizzard said they're pretty much done sending out invites. It's just Friends &amp; Family getting invited in waves now.
---
My first MMO was Star Wars Galaxies that used the F-Keys as default for the action bar.  Adding into the fact that my keyboard at the time had the F-keys grouped in groups of 4, it made finding the right key a lot easier.
---
I use the number row now, but still have a few things bound to the F-keys.
---
Awesome I’ll give those a try thanks
---
What’s toxic about playing the game?
---
I started playing in TBC, this was during the stress test only. The blizzard gods have not blessed me with normal beta access.
---
Short answer, yes.
---
Longer answer, absolutely.
---
What are the odds?
---
Extra long people unite!
---
I stand corrected. I remember having to use my 50lvl BoE staff well into raiding for my offtank set. Probably because it had +def on it and this was really hard to come by.
---
He said he was leveling with a friend though
---
Playing with friends &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rep
---
Lmao i literally answered your comment and now when i ask you to further explain your reasoning you respond with that? Nt dude
---
I mean people can play the class's they want to. No one's holding a gun to your head
---
And often a death if you haven't had good gear drops for 2+ levels.
---
I thought it would take maybe 3 months of near constant honor grinding to reach r14. Assuming +10rs a day 7 days week.
---
Debuff cap is cool. I will play warlock and I will have my place in raid. Just enjoy classic in his state, you can allways go back into bfa
---
Because internet points.
---
But it is breaking the experience. People WANT it, they want it with all the weird quirks it has.
---
bahahah these replies made me lol. I basically just made this thread to prove a point. Thank you all.
---
I do!
---
But I only use f1-f5 and only for cooldowns- working them into standard rotation stuff is too much of a stretch.
---
Haven't read it yet, only skimmed a few sections, but I appreciate write-ups like these. A lot of class performance reviews for vanilla tend to be filled with fluff, or based on general hearsay; so it's nice to be able to read more specific summaries on performance.
---
Do you think this low effort shit will get upvotes?
---
You missed. You're trying to reason how you missed a bloody turtle.
---
&gt; It’s always good to get the information out there
---
Yep, completely agree - that’s how I learned, otherwise I would have gone into vanilla still thinking “don’t use evasion” when fighting a warrior 😋
---
Are the nights still darker than retail? I forgot to check when the stress server was up
---
It could just be a priority system like you suggested. 
---
Spell batching windows do seem large on the beta in general sometimes looting feels so slow if you miss the cutoff.
---
this doesn't really work....
---
and by class they want, they mean stacking half the raid with affliction warlocks. That's all that happened when the debuff limit went up to 40 during the TBC pre-patch. More even more warlocks.
---
Classic is not a small world
---
Any good druid spec requires NS in meta PvP
---
Druids are specialists in just about every PvP context, not really healers but def not dps either
---
They track/stealth/scout in large scale wpvp, although generally you'd leave the rogues to scout cuz they are better than rogues in a group fight. 
---
In WSG they flag carry, which is what most of them base their specs around pretty sure
---
AB they defend caps, instant spam and being a healer broken as fuck IMO. Has a much more modern feel in that scenario. Lots of pillar humping and movement
---
AV they stealth so they move forward with the rogues ideally. Can also tank in AV no problem
---
At 2hrs/day, every day, it'll be 3-4 months to hit 60 unless you really min/max, do your research, and use guides/addons. With that you could bring it down to 2.5 months. But if you do pretty much anything but straight level (professions, dungeons, PVP, exploring), you're looking at closer to 6 months.
---
Streamers servers should be avoided at all costs as their legion of fucking retarded fanbois feeding them gold and suicide for the chance to be noticed on the stream will inevitably kill those servers.
---
They became tethered shortly after they were introduced. The vast majority of other mobs shouldnt be.
---
totally agree with this. the hunter rotation compared to other classes is a little bit more complex.  you also have to weave autoshots while moving, and send your pet in and out of some fights to make sure it doesnt die.   another honorable mention is fury warrior with its ability to swap between berserk and combat stance to use overpowers, which requires good rage management.
---
I totally understand where you’re coming from.  I’ll possibly play Warrior or Mage myself because I too don’t want to worry about debuffs or “meme”-specs.
---
Swifty one shot
---
damn retail (warfront) looks very good.
---
Druids can be top 5 dps in raids all the way up to aq and then they only slightly fall off and can still do some good dps. Feral druid dps is the most engaging skill based rotations in classic, other classes mainly press one or two buttons but druid has a lot of different factors going on. I would recommend looking up 'shedo' on youtube he goes into detail on how its done.
---
Me either. Fml.
---
I have pretty long fingers and tend to use at least F1-3 and an Alt modifier on F1
---
SPriest is the worst DPS you can bring in a 5-man.
---
If you played 2 hours a day every day without ever missing a day, it would take you about 4 months to hit 60
---
I appreciate the realism
---
Eh classic wow?
---
You wont be raiding as ret. Ret/Reckoning and Hybrid Ret/Holy are both pretty good for PvP. Full DPS Ret is not great, but passable in PvP.
---
Gz
---
U sure?
---
Conjecture and blanket statements do not warrant a post. 
---
Find something factual and present it if you want anyone to take you seriously.
---
I will be rolling on a realm with no big streamers, problem solved.
---
“No changes is good because it gives you the experience that made the game great but in TBC they should make changes to things I arbitrarily determined made the game not great.”
---
You have to work super hard to do average damage as a ret paladin. So it's either that or only healing in raids
---
5 for going healer spec. 7 for going shadow spec. Shadow spec priests are fast levelers, very respectable speeds. Not going shadow means you lose all that speed.
---
You could say the same of certain other classes though too I suppose, certain specs are much faster than others.
---
What was the split of community that got into the stress test. Seems like maybe 10 percent beta and 50 percent stress?
---
beware the occult.
---
Boar: Pathetic...
---
On your left.
---
Swiftly popularized gaming gear back in the day. Made razer huge
---
I don't use them but people usually move their hand around the keyboard to press them. At least that's what I've mostly seen people do. Either that or they have a keyboard where the F keys don't have a space between them and the number row.
---
Druid is certainly easier for solo content. If you like chasing numbers on a chart in raids, then Priest is certainly better.
---
Every class is required for raiding in Vanilla, so dont worry about not getting a raid spot.
---
Guess I was remembering them wrong. They were pretty rare. I had a lv 49 one for bgs and it was incredibly powerful.
---
Yeah especially when addons switch to the stance you need to use an ability anyway, what a total waste of.money
---
I hope you're using songs by Breaking Benjamin in your PvP video
---
try mythic jaina phase 1
---
Those gnomes don't look very tall to me.
---
I use f1-f5 for buffs and Target macros in pvp. There are keyboards out there where the distance between all the keys are the same. So there's no huge gap between w, 2 and f2. Image the f Keys being your 1 to 5 keys.. just moving them up a row.. so you move with 234 thus making even more room for binds.
---
&gt; will a bunch of minmaxer clans ruin the server experience for me?
---
No. 
---
They will certainly exist but they won't be the majority. Find some friends while leveling and stick with them and you'll be fine. 
---
There will be plenty or more casual and/or newbie friendly guilds out there.
---
You're a good person using a spoiler filter this late after release
---
It's a similar rotation to an enhancement shaman. I always felt that the two feel similar in a lot of ways.
---
If you would play elemental on the other hand, PvP arcane/fire mage maybe? Hard to say.
---
Why is the whirlwind axe always taken over the other whirlwind weapons? Is it just because of the talents? Because the sword talent seems really good too
---
Thank you m8!
---
What's a powergamer
---
You want to combine healing, situational buffing, and situational offense. My pvp spec after a bit of gear is Holy/ret, which is played like a melee resto/ele Shaman. Mostly healing, but situational burst damage.
---
You aren't the only one
---
https://youtu.be/cO-JVeuEqgo
---
Orc is the best race for every scenario except caster PvE, and humans which are the best PvE rogues.
---
Do items mailed to a bank alt, for example, ever expire? Or can I keep them in the mailbox forever to use as extra storage?
---
You’re worried about a mob running around and taking all the nodes? One group of people all in the same place is going to be taking less nodes than if they were spread out.
---
Nice!
---
This has to be some lowkey ironic shitpost to make fun of the circlejerk.
---
I do see the similarities too. I think pally is the right way to go.
---
It’s not just that. Many items got buffed by the time 1.12 came out so the gear we’ll have will be better. 
---
Honestly it’s a tricky problem to solve since we can’t really expect them to iterate through every balance patch
---
I dont think we can say that, theres ways to make content harder and while not being part of the #nochanges moronic horde, 8 debuff slots certainly isnt a good solution. Cherry picking certain changes is as good as making new changes and I defintely think theres better solutions out there than this.
---
Alright then pal let's get back on topic since we're so mature.
---
What about the people who are not going to book time off for a video game, are going to go to bed at like 11-12 because they work at 7 and then are going to get off around release and play for evening before going back to bed to get up early again the next day? 12am is pretty fucking far off from optimal for those people wouldn't you say? They might say a 12am launch is "stupid".
---
I guess you may be tempted to say "who cares about those people".
---
The stress test is from Wednesday May 29th to Thursday May 30th. Level cap is 10, if you had a character the last stress test, it remains.
---
In other news, May 29th is my birthday and I turn 23!
---
This post is a gigantic troll attempt and poor one at that.
---
Personally I just don't care for the looks of Tauren compared to Orc or Troll.
---
the troll area in hinterlands so epic.
---
pirate cove in tanaris good grinding.
---
I'm sure yours is so much better. Good thing you said something.
---
Spriests are great in dungeons.  Shackles and mind control work great.  5man foghts dont last long so mana issues are not bad.  Shadow priests do well early with hit talents, but bwl is when aoe casters start pulling ahead.  Aq40 is when shadow priests have mana and range issues and few gear upgrades.  Theres usually one spot for a shadow priest so as long as you farm a ton of pots, you will be fine.
---
Because in later expansions there were many bad choices that were made which resulted in certain changes coming into the game which could be completely eliminated if given a second chance to go over them and fix them. This would create a much better gameplay experience and could give blizz the chance to create the perfect game by taking the best elements of each expansion with the hindsight of already knowing what things to avoid. 
---
It would be absolutely ridiculous if they were to release TBC and WOTLK without removing flying and LFG for example.
---
hey did you find a leveling partner? im looking for one (NA-West Coast)
---
I think that's age more than a change as gamers as a whole.
---
why the hostility? just gave an honest answer.
---
wouldn't take it even if it was given for free.
---
But pally tier 2 is a dress.
---
there are 2 chars i want to play, in my head im planning on playing both (rogue, then druid) but the more i think about it and how long it takes to level i feel like i'll never be able to get them both done!  Are others planning on having at least 1 60 alt for dungeons and stuff?  I'm even considering making a second account and dual boxing (w/o software) to reduce my overall leveling time.  Anyone else considering this, or have any tips for keep up on 2 chars instead of 1?
---
I want to roll hunter, specifically a night elf, but really want to quest my way through elwynn forest and Westfall. What will be the downsides? If I remember right, no hunter trainer? And missed darnassus rep im afraid.
---
I've tried foot pedals. Not a fan.
---
I'm planning on playing Warrior when classic comes out, I think I'm gonna roll alchemy and herbalism since I'll mostly be doing PvE content. Would it be a better idea to get blacksmithing?
---
Also, why is the whirlwind axe always taken over the other whirlwind weapons? Is it just because of the talents? Because the sword talent seems really good too, but idk
---
These are seperate posts, I just didnt wait for the other one to load because of my shit Wi-Fi. Realized tjis might not have been as obvious as i thought.
---
Uhh about 50/50
---
Man you chose the wrong subreddit to post that in
---
https://youtu.be/C0N41rApngI
---
If you're a priest and you'd MC an ally faction mob like this, would an ally priest then be able to MC it now that its hostile?
---
PSA: addons/macros stance dance for you. Save your money.
---
We can agree to retire "toxic" if we can also retire "snowflake" and "triggered".
---
Online lingo these days is garbage.
---
Are you sure about F&amp;F waves? I'm still waiting for my invite and would be good to know they will keep sending F&amp;F invites.
---
From a pure min-max stand point:
---
Orcs and humans are the best fury warriors PvE wise.
---
Gnomes and trolls are the best casters PvE wise.
---
Dwarves are the best priests.
---
For RP I'd say:
---
Human paladin
---
Dwarf warrior
---
Gnome warlock
---
Night elf druid
---
Orc warrior
---
Undead rogue
---
Troll priest
---
Tauren shaman
---
I assume you are talking about leveling speed/kill speed. Killing things in classic will be slower for everyone. Paladins are particularly slow. They are also very durable. Unlike many later expansions, the world in classic is dangerous, and the risk of death from pulling to many normal mobs is real. Paladins are slow, but safe.
---
If those people cared enough they would have taken the next day off. This is the same shitty argument that blizzard used to add raid finder group finder and wow token. So people who work can catch up. If you cared enough you would have taken time off. If you didn’t then it’s your own fault.
---
4/10 troll. Try harder next time.
---
Its really nice to see everyone wearing Dungeon 1 items. No one will use Magister/Dreadmist head for example since it has 0 spellpower and you can easily obtain a Dreamweave circlet or a Felcloth hood/Shadowweave mask instead as a mage or warlock.
---
If it doesn’t yell like captain falcon on those two buttons, I’d be disappointed
---
why would you post this.
---
Jesus. Fucking. Christ.
---
Okay dude; right on. Have a good one.
---
Wow the old thottbot comments are back. This is very good and unbelievable for me
---
I've found that it is mostly Horde who follow this mantra. 
---
With that being said, there's nothing you can do about it if you wanna play on a PvP server.
---
I for one play Alliance and can't wait to make Hordies taste their own terrible cooking.
---
Was dance Revolution even out in 2004?!
---
Also, I don't know why'd you wanna go nelf warrior. Shadowmeld charge is gonna be fun for like 5 minutes.
---
Ddr came out in the 90s
---
monkeynews aka moo\_uk plays warrior
---
I’m sorry
---
Soda deleted it
---
Human warrior
---
Orc warlock
---
Troll mage
---
The soundtrack tied this together so nicely dude gj
---
If you like a Mmorpg that does not gift you presents for every fart you let lose than this is the game for you. You get to work for a nice progression and instead of getting 10 mounts thrown in your face the only thing that will be rewarding is the greaat almighty feeling of accomplishment!
---
I would give it 0/10, demon hunter is blatantly obvious.
---
thats untill you face a lvl 17 hunter
---
Decided to check out retail. That game is in a really sad state. All of the visual stuff they updated like the models, spell animations, and particles etc are nice but the game just has no rhyme or reason to it anymore. Class trainers exist to stand there and look pretty in a crowded room with every other class trainer next to them. You have NPC's that will teach you any profession you want, no more walking around to find the trainer you need or having to specifically go to certain places to train your craft. You could literally level just by sitting in Org if you wanted. 
---
No wonder they have lost subs and are at a low point. Almost everything about Retail is a joke and it sucks because I want to like it but there is absolutely nothing redeeming about it.
---
Imagine seeing Rag in the starter area with 0 context of vanilla lmaooo.
---
Lol! Me and my homies did the same thing... already have our groups set.... I started too early lol I couldn’t wait so had to pay for one month to get my fix.
---
I had one of these DDR pads, lol
---
And all that happens if you remove it that suddenly half your raid is warlocks.
---
removing the debuff limit doesn't fix anyone's problems.
---
Ele/enh/balance/Spriest are still useless.
---
Warlocks are amazing from the word go and just keep getting better.
---
Druids still don't deal any damage worth mentioning with dots.
---
Mages lose most of their slots to the warlocks and only get brought to decurse and make food and water, and that mostly depends on how many druid healers they brought. If you've got several druid healers they might be completely sunwelled.
---
Warriors can use deep-wounds for trivial amounts of dps.
---
Rogues can use deadly poison for trivial amounts more dps than instant was already giving them (and horde is still just using WF totem buffs), and hemo might get used for trivial amounts of extra dps depending on the rest of your raid comp.
---
Aka...the only people removing the debuff limit helps are 3 of the top 5 best raiding classes, who already had plenty of slots.
---
 **Powergaming** (or **power gaming**) is a style of interacting with [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game) or game-like systems, particularly [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game), [boardgames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boardgame), and [role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game), with the aim of maximising progress towards a specific goal.
---
Wow they rly did that? Jeeze.
---
No. Unless you are a streamer.  Not trolling btw. Blizz said they were done sending out invites but some streamers are still getting in.
---
One of our LFG Addon developers got his F&amp;F invite on Friday.
---
As far as I remember, you can mail items back and forth indefinitely.
---
Yeah, you'll have to go to SW for the training (iirc there is one there wasn't a hunter in classic though). You will miss out on rep, yes, but if your worry is the mount, you don't need exalted with your own faction for the mount.
---
&gt; I'm still waiting for my invite
---
The wait is over because it's not coming.
---
Yea he’s lying.., you need to be level 40 to craft a demon hunter. Takes ages to gather the appropriate meats and salts.
---
Well good thing the Internet isn't your safe space lol 
---
Go be offended elsewhere snowflake
---
They're going with 1.12 right? I was a druid in vanilla, so I might be mistaken, but the cap was the same as it was for healers: only one debuff per mob.  That means, in the case of warlocks, only one Warlock can have corruption up on the boss.
---
You still want multiple warlocks in a raid to stack different curses and to banish multiple mobs, but most warlocks in a raid are going to be just spamming shadowbolt the entire raid after they put their curse up.
---
Being a mage wasn't great either of course: I remember our guild's mages getting to raid half an hour early just to make enough water for the us healers.  
---
Warlocks were good at PvP, if that's your thing, but from what I read, honour and battlegrounds will not released in phase 1.
---
I think I worded it poorly, let me put it in a different way. 
---
What I mean is that no changes in classic means that we don't want to ADD anything new to the game because we simply don't know what sort of effect it might have and it simply isn't worth the risk of spoiling what most consider the greatest MMORPG of all time. 
---
When making changes to later expansions you are REMOVING features that we now know with hindsight to be troublesome and bad for the game. A lot of these things aren't just opinion, they are proven facts because we've already played through the expansions and seen what they've done to the community and various aspects of the game. 
---
Are you seriously telling me that if we had TBC and WOTLK servers you'd like to keep flying for BC and LFG for WOTLK? There are many other negatives that I'd remove but these are the 2 big ones.
---
how would a potion make the night darker? I get what Bilzzard is going for but it seems immersion breaking to me.
---
So basically the guide is saying a mage is a solid 8/10 leveler regardless of where you spend talent points.
---
That is absolutely incorrect. Even with 16 debuff slots, you don't just use Corruption, because at the end of the day, there's only a few spots left for random shit. What you usually see is 1-3 corruptions max. Which is not a lot when you think about how many Warlocks you bring.
---
Wish I could upvote twice
---
I can't help you with dual boxing but I'll tell you that I knew quite a few people I raided with who had a level 60 alt for farming purposes. You'll have a loooot of time to level as much as you want tbh. Do what's most fun for ya!
---
The 0.5 set is probably the best shot anyone will have of getting some okay gear, of they're playing casually. Aside maybe from crafted or rep gear.
---
You don't need to. Its random
---
im pretty sure pandaran monk has the best racials and all specs are viable
---
my main question is what Allied race to roll
---
Lmao I couldn’t even log in, I finally got in after work on the last day and after being online for 3 minutes the servers went offline
---
I think Classic is a great time to be a new player. There will be a huge range of players and guilds from hardcore to casual and everything in between. One single guild or group of guilds has very limited ability to impact the entire server (world bosses, world PvP?)
---
I mean saying streamer can tilt some people on this subreddit. So that's why I gave it a higher rating than zero.
---
To my knowledge yes. I made macros on my desktop and they were present on my laptop without copy pasting files.
---
They do but for the life of me I can't remember the term. I used to just sent my mail between a couple of toons if I needed.
---
Swifty style
---
Night elf warrior, count all the flips to do.
---
This is vanilla raiding though, I think people are going to get a shock when they see how limited the rotations are in raids. Warlocks pressing shadowbolt is the same thing.
---
Decide on a race/class?
---
Idk APES don't really embody the essence of vanilla to me. They are a tiny fraction of players who hardcore end game.
---
Vanilla has so much more to offer than just that so I think the beta needs a mix of hardcore players, semi-hardcore, RPers, casuals and highly social players who just log on to chat and mess around.
---
These streamers you describe fall into the last category. Plus they allow others to see the social potential that Classic has that they may have assumed didn't really exist.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Atleast someones trying to help. 
---
I've looked alot Into this pandaran herritige and may also roll monk
---
No thanks, I want to replay TBC and Wrath, not an altered version of it, the things you are suggesting is the same shit people get made at when they suggest things to add in vanilla.
---
R A Z E R N A G A
---
Honestly I don’t care about their opinion, that’s what’ll make the game dead in 9 months
---
I raid lead PUG MCs on Friday nights with my warrior alt.  I mained a rogue and cleared a little over half of Naxx and to the twin emps.  
---
Read better.
---
Yeah, and that was the first (and only?) wave.
---
Nah I disagree. I didn't shell out tons of gold to get flying mounts to be grounded and have to deal with trivial dangers. 
---
Flying is actually the best thing they've added to the game. If you are in an established guild with good groups there's no reason to believe Flying killed interaction. 
---
Seems like everyone who hates flying is someone who acts like they wouldn't make friends unless they ran everywhere. Or people who love to camp people in world pvp. 
---
That's just ignoring every PVE server and the fact that some people just don't wanna get ganked by some no life person while they're trying to just farm.
---
Yes it works. I also wrote the implications of the mouseover change if you missed those.
---
Ok we get it man. You want to play a shadow priest or a warlock.
---
Next you will be asking for class like moonkin ret ele enh arcane buff.
---
Pretty sure he was just being playful...
---
Good fucking luck and be patient
---
Like lfr, lfd, talents, make the dungeons harder like they were originally, etc.
---
Cata wasn't that bad but it had a bad rap for lack of content because they spent so much time redoing the old zones.
---
I too was about to mention Guild Wars 1. They handled it rather well, since the customization and character builds revolved much more around gear/assigning skill points and a lot less on "leveling up" and getting bigger numbers.
---
He means if there is say 1000 people in a starting zone making tagging next to impossible.
---
no need, as long as you have an active sub you're eligible to it
---
If the last test is an indication of what will happen, expect blizzard to throttle logins to test login queues and server stability. This will laat approximately 2 hours or so? After that, they'll refresh and change the settings to allow the flood gates to open.
---
I guess.. but until then, is it not worth getting their attention in another way? :) like a petition perhaps \^\^
---
Play what you like. Dont feel forced to minmax. Havent seen any human caster bullying.
---
I am not sure if this is an attempt at humour or if you just have a bad screen or something. The ability is "t**h**rash" not "trash". You can see it clearly at 0:58 if you don't believe me.
---
Haha. Yes!!!!
---
If they make a BC server after Vanilla I would not want them to remove anything because it’s a slippery slope just like removing problematic racial abilities in classic would be. If they make a WotLK server I wouldn’t even play it because IMO it wasn’t even a good expansion but even still only Cataclysm flying ruined anything because you could fly in the whole world. Flying in Outland only was fine. People still went interacted in EK/Kalimdor all the time.
---
and you need so much salt it's insane.
---
What was the name?
---
Because of the weapon speed. Slower weapon = more dps
---
No, it's just so few people on this subreddit are apart of F&amp;F that you don't see the big threads like when a wave goes out.
---
F&amp;F invites are trickling out slowly. There are also other factors involved.
---
Did your Blizz friend/family member ONLY put you on the list? If so, you got priority. If your connection added 5 for example, there is less priority.
---
I was specifically told my friend even being on the F&amp;F list isn't a guarantee, except he put me as priority due to me being the only one so odds are I will get in. He originally told me Thursday 5/23 I should have been in, but I am still not in yet.
---
The F&amp;F invites will roll out slowly. You could be waiting a few weeks, and maybe not get in at all if your connection put more than one person.
---
Honestly, every time I heard Dave Matthews Band or Audioslave I think of WoW.... back when Pandora existed before Spotify.... its a weird combo I know but it happened, and I can’t remember if it was by choice.
---
shitty foot pedals that proabably came from early 2000's 
---
no input lag
---
Pick one.
---
Also Alt. You can map Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, Shift+Alt, and Ctrl+Shift+Alt.
---
Cause they look good and playing a human in a fantasy / mmo game is lame in some people’s eyes.
---
I’m not one of those people, but I can understand where they’re coming from.
---
Guess we gotta wait for abit. I suspect they will add more users in the later stages of beta
---
Frost shock post 1.4 patch grants massive damage and a 50% slow for a duration longer than its cooldown, making you able to effectively perma-slow people to death.
---
[https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=27804&amp;stream=2](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=27804&amp;stream=2)  There is the direct link to it, It might have been bad but i dont remember it was so long ago and it was my character back on classic. I want to bring some Nostalgia back and watch it with my brother we both used to play. Would you please be able to download it and send it to me or post it on youtube or something ? Thank you so much in advance
---
People already can play the classes they want.
---
Yes , but a lot of us are excited for reasons that people like you should understand. I'm not in the beta but I played the original beta through lich king. I come back each expansion at the end, do the content in a month and repeat, so I play wow every couple of years.
---
That said, the currwnt wow has many more features, abilities, mounts, items, and what not. Yet, it lost its soul along the way.
---
In the original, it was immersion, and the social aspect it brought. The forums were chirping with stories and not recruitment spam. To be in the top, with vis maior and kold amd his crew required time, dedication, and skill.
---
People like vainglory, and the infamous poster of melt faces kept us all actively involved in the game.
---
You didn't press a button and tape your right mouse down to clear a raid like now. You had to prepare , for even ubrs. It took time, and people took breaks and got to know each other. 
---
Through the ganks, the guild drama, and the loot ninjas, nothing felt like an adventure. All those people tired of loot boxes, and mmos feeling empty. They started here, and ,that itch, that feeling we had 15 years ago....its back. 
---
This is the best time to start. Just remember, classic wow is an adventure. Its the journey, the people you meet, and the experiences that made it incredible. If you want a flying giraffe, and chasing upgrades every 2 months, while grinding rep, it may not be for you.
---
Macros, my friend.
---
No thanks lol
---
Oh right, thanks
---
Well, you also don't need that many people to know what to do. If you have one idiot messing up thadius, he just instantly dies. In vanilla, no one knew what to do. Even if that's bumped up to 25%, it's so much easier. In the 75% range your not going to have much trouble with pugs. Look at retail wow at the end of a tier you have pugs clearing heroic pretty easily, with increased gear and simpler pug friendly strats becoming more known. It just makes it exponentially easier for everyone the more you know.
---
Got the same setup on my hunter, it’s all feign death though.
---
Don't think half the people in here even realize it just a photoshopped picture lol.
---
The challenge against melee is mitigated a little with Tauren warstomp every 2 min
---
Yep, I never do alt by itself because I've had some games sort of sticky key it when I alt-tab.
---
do you think people play maces in a sword spec too
---
hemo is terrible for daggers
---
evocation/MA is based on spirit, which humans get 5% more of, and also as a result have better MA+Medi rates of mana recovery.
---
All you get from the int racial is more maximum mana and roughly 1% extra spell crit. It does nothing with regard to your mana efficiency, humans are actually superior on that front.
---
What I mean is, once you've made the petition, who do you give it to? If you have a contact, better give him this post with all the links, that's all that matters to them
---
I literally felt dehydrated trying to farm my first DH.
---
Dude, I forgot all about this video. I loved this back in the day! 
---
Take my thumb you karma whore you!
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I'm 27F and 5'2". My feet don't reach the floor... I have to have a foot stool under the desk.
---
everyone saying vc is braindead. you shortname dungeons based on their name, not the quest(s) or boss(es) inside them
---
He's throwing shade at Tipsout.
---
Calm down. Go back to r/TD.
---
&gt; It was interesting on paper, unfortunately Blizzard's implementation left a lot to be desired. It's a PvE only scripted encounter on rails (it's very hard to fail).
---
Still waiting on HC warfront testing though, maybe they will offer a challenge ...
---
Awesome
---
Wondering if there's any Hunter YouTuber out there
---
Here's a [release map](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/ui/UI5GHS0013QD1557845843113.jpg) with times.
---
Could also just learn to stance dance like a real warrior
---
The market dictates what people go, though. 
---
Pots absolutely won't be the issue, because Alchemy is one of the most popular 'crafting' professions out there, because it works on any class, and the fact that Herbalism is one of the best ways to earn money if you go in-depth with spawns and routes, which is only worth money, as long as there's people with Alchemy to make the pots/flasks.
---
In short, it's not the best professions to have in terms of sheer uniqueness, but the fact that it fits all classes and it can make pots, which basically everybody raiding needs, it'll have lots of people rolling it, that's for sure.
---
Tauren are best for tanking. Warstomp and hp are great
---
Imagine the lantern is togglelable 😳
---
Until you get enough crit to always have Deep Wounds up the crit from axe mastery is better than sword spec. Poleaxe spec is good also because you have more options to chose from. There's not many options and they're not close in level with the Axe but it's something.
---
whats wrong with the post, its low effort, but still, whats actually wrong w it?
---
&gt;when it comes to Blizzard actually creating from scratch - I honestly don’t believe they “got it” anymore.
---
I could not agree with you more. I think the best chance they have at retaining subscribers and possibly growing is to rerelease Classic through Wrath without breaking anything. 
---
&gt;Also reading comments on this post / sub I don’t think the community knows what it wants either.
---
For the most part yes, but the "no flying" faction have been really loud for  years by now. I don't understand it for TBC or Wrath. It was really hard to scrape up the gold to even get basic flying in TBC. I knew a lot of players that never bought the fast speed until  Wrath launched.
---
Yeah its total bullshit how beta is going out. They says its about how long you have been active in WoW and a little luck but that's total bullshit. You get invited either because your a streamer or pure luck of the draw. Been playing wow on the same account since Vanilla yet Im left out, which isn't that big of a deal until you see idiots like this................Gratz to those who did get in, have fun and see you on Live classic.
---
There's a classic pvp discord but it's been infested with classic shills, still the old private tryhards tho.
---
26th in US, 27th everywhere else. Looks like 8am AEST for you
---
Yeah, that's one of the best parts about retail which is upsetting.
---
oh yeah 25% stun resist sure does nothing vs warrior rogues or palas who make your live hell. Rather have that 2second stun that is useless because rogues already killed you.
---
Yeah you can chat with your battle.net friends cross server I believe, but you won't be able to group up with them as far as I know. I think the only activity allowing cross server connections with be Battlegrounds but even then I'm not thinking that you can group up with friends that are cross realm even if you're on the same group of servers for that. 
---
In short, if you have friends you might be playing with it's probably best to sort out what faction and type of server you all want to play on (pve, pvp, etc)
---
Tyvm i spent a good deal on trying to get it to match the narrative!
---
I mean UC is much closer to those raids than Org is but everyone still hung out at Org instead in Vanilla
---
Premades consist of 10+ people, you won't take like 3-4shamans with you. So yes, go orc.
---
No but playing dirty you can stand in places that might have funny results. I would like to mc someone though a walk through portal or into some mobs. When mc breaks they die in mobs or it buys you time. A priest will mc you into world boss or off a cliff. Making someone swim is fun. My signature move was mc into spinning frenzy. Their screen will spin at home and they might get disoriented. People usually run away after that or get so mad they chase you. MC is my favorite ability in game maybe.
---
Ah, thought it would be something like that, thanks for the answer
---
I wonder why they felt compelled to correct something so old.
---
Download links are dead, which is pretty standard for WCM. [They're basically a fraud at this point.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/55mp5b/do_not_for_any_reason_purchase_a_premium_account/) (there are tons of threads like that). Only reason I have an account is because OwnedCore shares one. Sorry =/
---
I could not agree with you more. I think the best chance they have at retaining subscribers and possibly growing is to rerelease Classic through Wrath without breaking anything.
---
Blatantly obvious too! Ah jeez.
---
So with normalized weapon speed I should just pick the weapon with the highest DPS right?
---
You know how people say:
---
"I wish I could read Lord of the Rings (or Harry Potter) for the first time again."?   
---
You have that chance! There is a reason WoW is still the unbeaten champion of MMO games.   
---
Invest your time in Classic. Experience it all as we once did. It's a journey. An Adventure.
---
stun resists pretty much instant win you a lot of situations, no question asked. Resisting a cs/ks/charge on a heal etc pretty much wins you the fight. The stun does not do much. Shamans are not exactly frontliners in pvp, you have a team to back you up. 
---
In solo situations if you get stunned warstomp won't help much, and classes with no stuns generally are not going to be in range to stomp.
---
what are you talking about?   if there is no healer in a team fight, you applying dots on the whole enemy squad will eat through half their healthbar which should be more than enough to make the difference.    
---
and who mentioned druids? but i would love to learn how a druid is better than a shadowpriest in pvp, that is utter bullshit.     they are good flag runners, but not comparable to shadow priests in pvp.
---
Vanilla is the foundation, the supporting pillars of what made WoW great and the gaming phenomena that it became and while other expansions certainly made some welcomed additions to it, there also came many negatives. 
---
It's nothing like when people suggest to add things to Vanilla because I'm not advocating that we add anything new to TBC or WOTLK. I'm simply advocating that we remove features that we now know to be troublesome because we've actually played through them and seen the impact that they've had. If you'd genuinely rather play WOTLK with LFG and there stupid raid sizes/difficulties that fucked raiding up because you want to play an unaltered version as opposed to a superior more vanilla like version then I don't think we'll ever come to a level headed conclusion because your opinion on game design would just automatically be null to me.
---
Orc Shaman.
---
damn :( I had someone do it a couple years ago but i completely forgot where i saved the file this sucks I just cant see it again I guess but thanks for the try bro
---
Or Thrall, one-man attacking Goldshire.
---
I'd dust off my twitch account just for that
---
Why aren’t we pursuing this?  This would be an awesome thing for most classes.  Hunters for aspects, pallies for auras, Druid’s for forms, rogues for poisons, shamans for totems.  
---
I’d buy one....
---
It was a repeated typo, sorry about that.
---
They increased the melee leeway in either Cata/Wod/Mop. I don't have documentation to prove it though. 
---
Listen buddy, I've watched thousands of hours of clips on vanilla and I can count on 2 hands. There are some videos of people from far in 2005/06 where this 'Leeway' worked in EXTREMELY rare circumstances not in EVERY second of combat. BUT that ultimately points the question becomes if it more about lag then a real mechanic. 
---
If you think this is correct, show me this happening in 1000s of videos? 
---
Philosophically, It's not ONLY on me to show evidence of the correct mechanic but also of you as well. And the majority of evidence is on my side.  
---
What you fail to understand is that if 'this' Mechanic was in vanilla, then all types of kiting melee and ranged is completely null and impossible. This type of mechanic changes how the game is fundamentally played. It's not a question of it worked like this in Vanilla. Every movie in vanilla you will see kiting. 
---
You cannot currently kite successfully a person who is chasing you. If you think that's proper Vanilla Mechanics you simply lack experience and knowledge.

Classic should be more for new players than being a nostalgia trip, 15 years ago we were all new players to the game, that’s what the spirit of classic is. Classic should be for new players to experience something that was lost with time. Classic players should embrace new players as it grows the community, and isn’t that what classic is all about, community?
---
Tool/apc’s first album/aphex twin/Radiohead take me back to 2005 pretty hard.
---
Lol ok buddy. It doesn’t say that heartbeat resist was added in 2.0.
---
There is something very regal and majestic about a human and the game’s medieval flavors (churches, monasteries , cities, building materials, lineage of the leaders, etc). For me, as an exercise in RP, it makes all the other races and zones you encounter extraordinary, ludicrous, and fantastic. In Vanilla, I leveled a human warrior to 30, then a human warlock which I main’d until TK in TBC. My current alt is a gold-clad Human Paladin with a lions head on his shield. 
---
Every once in a while I go visit the old Scarlet Crusade areas in the Eastern Kingdoms because those areas make me very nostalgic. I gave a s!!t about stopping those human fanatics, garbed in white and red, led by some power hungry maniac sitting in some stone structured fortification. 
---
Other people like to play upright cows, hunched over green skins, or jawless skeletons. 😎
---
Classic: human/dwarf warrior/priest or mage
---
If I come back to Live: transfer form orc to Dwarf/Dark iron shaman
---
It’s by far the easiest modifier for me. The only one you can press with your thumb
---
this was the video that convinced me mage was the dopest shit ever in the game and to roll one  
---
idek why. they're all just pressing one button.
---
&gt; But the min-max people will most likely farm herbs to make money, which only makes them money if people have Alchemy.
---
How will they have herb when they need mining to level engineering? And how will people have Alchemy when everyone is rolling engi because every guide says it's required for pvp and raiding?
---
More likely is they just forgot the quest dialogue written over a decade ago when compiling the book.
---
I played a druid in vanilla.  The only viable spec was resto, and as a healer you have no out of combat Rez, which makes healing 5 mans... Difficult.
---
They added some feral loot near the end (ZG/AQ), but even that didn't help nearly enough.
---
Some made it work in PvP, but from what I'm reading a lot of PvP won't be there at launch.
---
Druid will guarantee you a raid spot because of innervate but that's about the only thing it has going for it.
---
Snutz isn't a leveler but his pvp is wild
---
Shorter stun cd, interrupt resistance, blessing of kings, much much much higher durability (prot talent tree), longer freedom.
---
If a ret takes those he has no points in the holy tree and I will not attempt to tell you why that is bad.
---
Holy also wears gear more designed for support/heal (healing plate/sp plate entirely) with a shield etc whilst being almost unccable due to sacrifice (and being at range) whilst the ret is not.
---
A ret healing is strictly worse than a holy healing, less crit chance on healing etc.
---
You said it yourself, pvp cc is king. What happens when you have a nigh immortal healer in the back who cannot be cced?
---
Since I’m not nostalgia-tripping, I’ll probably listen to some podcasts or the in game music.
---
I'm gonna listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6paZNo17c) at least a dozen times while lvling.
---
Are you a bot?
---
Pfft casuals....   
---
Just grow extra limbs....   
---
These kinds of people ruined WoW
---
gotta make sacrifices to always have 1 hand on the dew bottle.
---
I miss the days of hiding on a level 1 troll alt on the forums.
---
Welcome to /r/classicwow
---
We're pretty much all in that boat. I quit in WoTLK as well. Can't wait.
---
When I played vanilla (since 2nd beta) I was only about 10. My older sisters were very into Postal Service at the time. Since they were older they got to play their music and I did not. Still to this day I can't hear a Postal Service song without flashing back to Westfall killing Defias hahaha
---
Its a video from what...15y ago? What would you think it was? Lol
---
Vanilla is where millions and millions of players started. Consider the fact that vanilla is what made a name for world of Warcraft in the gaming world, so I think it's a pretty great place to start.
---
Sometimes you just gotta be comfy.
---
I had no idea about "legends" I mostly only knew famous and infamous players of the particular realm I played on and not much else.
---
You even got Tel'Abim in there!
---
I have these same foot pedals and I used them for PUBG. Works great
---
I'll play a priest, but I want to play Shadow Priest for PvE just for a change of usually healing. Also, because I like PvP in general and Shadow Priests are fun to play.
---
Only thing I'm scared of, is me not finding a guild with the Shadow Priest spot up and/or I talk with guilds recruiting before the launch and I get the spot, but at some point during leveling or at max level, the guild disbands and I have to find a new guild as a shadow priest, which there usually is only 1 spot for.
---
Isn’t this the very reason why layering is being implemented? I think you should just go for it first day, a week late at most.
---
you know your hand can move right? doesnt take the much effort for hit the F keys lol.
---
🤷
---
or a few handy tentacles
---
I love it, but how is it pronounced?
---
Probably the best time to jump in unless you enjoy leveling by standing around doing nothing in your factions main city with a queue going.
---
I'm so jealous. I'd love to experience the magic that is vanilla again without any knowledge of it
---
Wat
---
They said they’re still sending them out just less and they’re almost done
---
That sword drop in the spider cavern lasted you all the way to 60, impressive
---
perhaps he should pick what he thoroughly enjoys more?
---
I don't like you
---
Dots are not ticking like in wotlk and there is ALWAYS a healer present at fights, if not you already won hard prior so that's not even an argument.
---
I meant druids are worse than shadows.
---
Keep your experiences from trash tier premades where people are not even using consumables out of a sub where people ask for class advice, otherwise they may get the wrong impression. Dotting up half the team? By that point you are oom and you cannot fulfill your duty to support anymore lol.
---
What good are a few dots when a lot of classes like hunter or warrior eat through healthbars in 2-3seconds? Dots are useful in prolonged fights or stalemates, where priests heal and dispel.
---
Berseker stance image is a dwarf? Damn.. alwats thought it was like a tornado or something
---
Bro if you're 24 then you were like 11 in vanilla
---
6 days, lol.
---
My partner when I said 3 weeks. I did promise her a trip out of the city for 3 days during that period though so it worked out fine.
---
Worth?
---
its definitely the best choice for horde side druid
---
It wasn't a good expansion because they made a load of shit game design choices to cater to casuals that we could now go back and revamp in order to make it more vanilla like which further iterates my point of removing harmful features like flying from TBC and LFG/piss easy raids from Wrath to make them better than they were. I'd also argue that no racial ability in Vanilla is actually "harmful" to the game, just not fully balanced like the rest of the game. 
---
If redone it could be a mega expansion considering it contained the most beloved character in the warcraft universe, the best storyline by tying up the warcraft series and one of if not the greatest raid ever made in Ulduar.
---
\[stance:X\] macro condition for warrior is correct only during gcd, when not in gcd \[stance:3\] is always true whatever your stance
---
Layering is per continent, not per zone. So 10k players in Kalimdor is still 10k players where as it's designed for 1500ish people.
---
dwarf rogue is the dream
---
It really wasn't. Take a breather.
---
It's probably a combination of things, but I think the biggest reason is because of the Internet being different like u/smallerk said. Now everything gets figured out quickly, datamined, and information spreads faster than it ever has.
---
The Internet in 2004 was smaller and people were more ignorant, and MMOs were more mysterious with less easily accessible and complete information on them. It added more sense of exploration, now that's harder to achieve because everything gets figured out so quickly.
---
I'm incredibly jealous of small girls that can sit with their legs crossed in a regular office chair. I'm 100% going to fall backwards if I try to get one leg up on the chair...
---
As a drummer and a guitarist who loves foot pedals I’ve dreamed of this becoming a thing. I need to get on this train!!! Love it.
---
troll is best tank due to berserker threat. Tauren is close.
---
&gt; You could literally level just by sitting in Org if you wanted.
---
That has been the case since the halfway point of WotLK when they added +XP to the LFD queue.
---
You misspelled keg, Daughter of Ironforge.
---
It is nice to be able to curl up in my chair while I'm watching Let's Play videos
---
Nice video man.  I’ve been playing WoW since the original open beta in 2004, and NEVER took the time to get into the lore and understand the world.  With the wait for Classic, I’ve taken some time to get into it and it’s some fascinating stuff!  Hope to see more videos like this... trying to find as many good sources of lore relevant to Classic as I can while I wait for the end of August.
---
Mostly in-game with a few playthroughs of the tool album releasing the same week as classic
---
I didn't misspell it! It's a foot stool when it's empty!
---
Yes but if you chose race before faction Night Elf would be better.
---
&gt; How will they have herb when they need mining to level engineering? 
---
Because they usually go Skinning/Mining while leveling. Keep mining till they have everything for 300 Engineering + quests and whatever specialization they want. Then dump both of them and go Engineering/Herbalism.
---
&gt;And how will people have Alchemy when everyone is rolling engi because every guide says it's required for pvp and raiding? 
---
Because not everyone is rolling Engineering and those that do still have one spot left, for whatever they want to compliment it with, which could be Alchemy. You only go Herbalism as a min-maxer to make money, but plenty of min-maxers don't need the mount and will go actual useful professions for the guild, like Alchemy.
---
Or as same min-maxers do, level an alt to 35 and make pots/tailoring mats with that.
---
Who told you I was Gortha Goblinreaver?
---
Stitches.
---
You're right. But it was still happening even in 2004, we were just more able to be ignorant of it because we were 12 and enjoyed leveling without worry about how long it took.
---
There are going to be lots of shamans.
---
And lots of indignant shamans when they realize they only heal in raids.
---
Never seen a more clicker setup in my life.

---
1) They did not create much problem for you not being gnome?
---
2) Warlock on Alliance is that bad on BG/WPvP?
---
3)  Is it good to duel as Warlock on the alliance, since no one has WoTF?
---
Thank you for doing this. I got some questions:
---
Are fishing schools and debris present?
---
Can you fish sagefish and can you buy the recipe to cook them?
---
We give it to the support of Blizzard, who then passes it up the food chain until their CEO gets it. :D
---
Compared to classic? Yeah it is
---
Sadly I believe they're going to be tethered. Stuff like that and the corrupted blood fall into a category of hilarious shit they don't want to become a recurring problem, I think. Makes for some outrageous memories but ultimately can be abused too often to just grief entire cities. You and I might love that shit but I vaguely recall them making some comment that implied it won't be possible in Classic. 
---
Here's to hoping people discover some totally new busted shit.
---
Reality is probably just a simulation anyway.
---
Brooo thank you sooo much !! Your a blessing man your the best I appreciate it !!!!!
---
Flying mounts, increasing the level cap every expansion, sharting, dungeon finder, lfr. You could come up with a very long list of "QoL" stuff thast wasn't done right or was just a bad idea for the game.
---
It was still happening, but not as many people paid attention to it, even older people. A lot of players didn't even know what Thottbot was.
---
Is there a maximum number of members in a guild in Classic? If so, what is the max?
---
I believe WoW in BfA has a maximum of 1000 members, but IDK what the case back in 1.12 was.
---
Find a pet you like and keep it. You need to actively level a pet or tame a new one at a high level.
---
i wish you asked more questions so there would at least be some more punctuation the way it is now i really have a hard time  reading what you are trying to say maybe i will give it another look and actually try and form some kind of reply or maybe not ? anyway i do love druid myself good to have you here bud see you in the game and welcome home ok
---
We call him Pudge in my circles.
---
Oh I'm all for flying, 100% the best thing ever. But I do see their point of wanting people to ground mount to start it all off, so they can see everything they worked hard to make. 
---
The achievment tho is amazing cause it gives account wide flying. Which is perfect for someone like me who had 31 110s at the time
---
Good old pom pyro.
---
(almost) everyone wants to feel represented by the character, in beauty or concept
---
Alright, thanks dude, as long as there is a trainer in SW I'll be golden then.
---
If it’s dead it’s red.
---
No one! I mean, that one Gnome.
---
Reading comprehension
---
Generally behind mage.  Mage talent tree is better constructed.  
---
Early on mages get +6 hit which is huge and there isn't enough hit gear to make it up for warlocks.  
---
Eventually this is more hit gear, and warlock set gear is often better itemized allowing them to catch up and maybe even surpass mages, but by BWL threat(especially as horde) becomes a major issue.  If both are perfectly geared, buffed, and played then the mage has a theoretical 30% higher damage cap just because of the threat talent.  
---
By late AQ and naxx mages go fire with high crit, and start doing silly things with ignite something no class can directly compete with.  This also creates weird situations that is difficult to compare peoples damage 1 to 1 since the mages are feeding each other damage.
---
Twinkle Lighthands! That skank!
---
Like the blink animation ruined it for me when I saw it zoomed in!
---
I see! Lol never mind.
---
Are they great in pvp though? Maybe in 1v1 against some classes and good FC. Other than that I donno.
---
&gt;is gonna be fun for like 5 minutes
---
Same can be said about anything in the game, lol.
---
&gt; with the aim of maximising progress towards a specific goal
---
What is your specific goal then? Orcs are more than decent in PvP too.
---
you win!
---
Excellent point.
---
Ah well. I have a single USB foot switch. But, mainly for PTT in FPS. Looks to be the same model actual switch though.
---
I suppose it could also be used for something in WoW.. Never bothered.
---
that's exactly what they want you to think
---
Ptt button is actually such a good idea
---
Oh my god..
---
Auto dismount and daze after 30s unless you touch the ground.
---
&gt;streamer
---
Hmmm... [https://gph.is/1syOuOO](https://gph.is/1syOuOO)
---
That,....wait, what? Should I go to a Priest and get cleansed?
---
Couldn't you do this? You just couldn't switch the bag if the new bag was in the one being replaced. I may be wrong though.
---
I don't think that was possible in vanilla. Do you think it should stay this way or require empty bags like back in the day?
---
Nah, stone form are not that good for rogues.
---
I disassembled 4 USB pedals and replaced the original sensors with spare cherry blacks.  I then connected them to a teensy as part of a small keyboard I setup and bound them to movement (L strafe - forward - forward - R strafe).  It feels a bit more engaging to me and I like having nothing but spells and modifiers under my fingers.  I'm not a very good WoW player so I can't really say if it gives any sort of advantages.
---
In a video game? Lol k champ 😘
---
Classic compared to classic? Lmao
---
&gt; The internet as we know it now barely existed back then
---
Yeah, it did. We had thotbot, allakhazam, and many other sources of information. 2004 wasn't the internet dark ages lol, 1994 was.
---
Yeah I was saying this to my friend who convinced me to play classic. I’d never touched WoW, but now I’m already doing research and practicing a bit on a pserver, so I’ll be ready to grind it out in August. 
---
Me as a teenager 15 years ago? I’d make lvl 6 then my mom would make me log, and I’d spend the next day daydreaming about getting my fear spell at lvl 8, and working toward crafting my wand. Actually, I probably wouldn’t know wands existed...
---
I mean he was just awful at playing, didn’t even watch him pvp later
---
You're UTC+12 right? So the servers come online at 10:00AM on August 27th for you.
---
[MRW I'm questing in STV and hear rogue stealth sound](https://media.giphy.com/media/UQhN0FHlb7E2tqwGkD/giphy.mp4)

I'm not sure either but I remember being annoyed that I had to empty my bag first, could be wrong tho
---
You are so lucky. You're gonna have a blast.
---
That'll show em.
---
ty for the help i'm just asking if  i main as druid for pve is it a good idea or not to be feral dps and if i go as healer is it easy to heal as resto druid compared to the other healing classes
---
This is a terrible idea lol. Just get a fucking MMO mouse.
---
I think you know what I meant. But in case you didn't, I meant retail. Dont be a dick
---
Best racial ever.
---
Mining, herbalism, skinning for gathering.
---
tailoring, leatherworking, blacksmithing
---
enchanting, alchemy.
---
Tailoring is mostly useless -- unless you are a priest, in which case you can make truefaith vestments (~tier2.5). However the chest off baron is arguably better (it has spirit and 4? less +healing). The thing is the recipe is quite rare. 
---
Leatherworking creates two pre-raid BiS items for rogues (and hunters if I recall --- even though leather). The Devilsaur set.
---
Blacksmithing I can't really speak about. I played a warrior but never learned anything about it. Obviously blacksmiths have to make the Hand of Ragnaros but other than that I don't know what else they can do (Good crafted recipes, etc, no idea). 
---
Alchemy is very nice to have. There are so many consumables in vanilla and most players back then didn't really take advantage of them. If you think buying runes in BfA is rough on the bank account, in vanilla there are several 'rune' like buffs you can get. Flasks are very good, but they can only be created in two places (Blackwing lair, and scholomance). The recipes for flasks are also dropped by bosses (UBRS, scholo, and somewhere else) with a fairly low drop rate ~4%. 
---
Enchanting is good for gold, because it is so damn hard to level. Just the sheer amount of blues and greens you have to disenchant to get to 300 is astounding. There are some pretty dope enchants in vanilla, like 2% reduced threat on cloak, improved stealth, etc.
---
ty  for the help its look like a Hope &gt;.&lt; for me ty so much
---
This video made me want to get to cap so that I could mind control in PVP.  While I never did this I did used to mind control people off the bridge in AV when Alliance was pushed back and having to turtle.
---
In the classic pic the clouds make a spooky face :o
---
You're not quite right. I would quote my friend from blizzard, but I don't want to let him down. But what I can say for sure, it's not a secret - another guy from the same F&amp;F list got his invite on Thursday at \~3PM PST.
---
Mage till AQ and then it changes to spam fireball
---
Vanilla cake out 15 years ago, 15 + 9 = 24
---
Thanks a lot dude. And yeah definitely get into it. Knowing the lore even casually makes everything you interact with and do a bit more gratifying.
---
I came across Frost when looking for classic videos. Like him a lot.
---
If they're the same as the single one I have (looks the same) there is some software where you can program it to activate any key. I know for sure Ctrl works. I have mine on Left Ctrl.
---
just be aware that Tauren can only ride Dire Wolves and Kodos. (And only Gnomes/Dwarves can ride mech-striders).
---
Mounts acquired as drops (or the bug mounts) are exempted of course and don't require any training to use either, you just need to be level 60.
---
Also keep in mind that they're using the old system of riding.
---
You have to buy training for each type of mount (a one time purchase of 20g -discounts, requiring exalted for other race's mounts/training), and the mounts themselves are extremely expensive.
---
Really depends on what you're playing. Some classes benefit from faster weapons (i.e. application of poisons and certain procs)
---
Don’t you need to tame different pets to learn different ranks of pet abilities?
---
Maybe, who knows. Point is, reading a book or going out or whatever is no more valid a hobby than gaming.
---
Your free time is to de-stress yourself and to make yourself happy. Whichever activity you choose.
---
Also, gaming is probably better for your intelligence than doing shots or reading a book anyway. ( depending on the game and the book )
---
My personal goal is min-max a fun character that i feel represented.
---
You'll have to watch out for Rogues and Shamans purging/interrupting you beyond oblivion though.
---
You don't need a tiny amount of HP as a tank unless your healers suck. Warstomp is somewhat decent for tanking dungeon packs, but you don't usually minmax dungeon packs utility.
---
The at home version wasn't, but it was in arcades
---
Probably playing a WotLK private server.
---
Enjoy the class quests finding those totems.
---
there are. Just bounce between the Orc/Undead zones every 5 levels doing quests. Horde is actually in a good position to raise nearly every reputation at once since the only tauren quests you really potentially miss are the mulgore ones.
---
Alliance though is awkward as NE don't link up into the leveling path until 20+ and you miss out on a lot of quests by then.
---
Basic maths!
---
Sorry I should have mentioned that. I‘ll be playing a paladin so I was thinking about the SoC proc dmg.
---
https://youtu.be/pO2YC0mYkAE
---
This still gives me chills.
---
UGH, freaking coneheads!!!!
---
Try a Paladin. Lay on Hands is the only cure for an encounter with HER
---
I am right there with you and I am sure a lot of Vanilla players feel the same. Vanilla was just hardcore playing for me... burning crusade was still decent but just wasn't quite the same. Wrath really was when I didn't recognize the game and tried to give it a good month to finally give up on it. The rest of the expansions I tried when they went on sale and ultimately just left within the week. The newest expansion I havn't even tried.
---
Wouldn't orc racial give more threat? -50% healing would hurt but people tank with Death Wish and Recklessness... I wonder if many dare to add reduced healing to it.
---
I'm not sure what you mean. Like the flexing emote in wow?
---
SHAMAN QUESTION: Will chain heal bounce to lower hp targets first or will it be completely random?  I feel like it used to be random but cant remember.
---
Not too sure what you're asking about with regards to a gnome. 
---
TBH, this was 13? years ago? However I hit Lieutenant Commander in BG's as a human warlock and I'm not too sure about diminishing returns on Fear, but Fear was actually useful in duels and BG's because not every class had everything (interrupts, silences, etc...). BG's and PVP back then was like very class specific? Like a rogue COULD mess up a warlock until Demo got Felgaurd. So you'd tell your felgaurd to stay put then when you got stun locked by a rogue-&gt; felgaurd charge-&gt; dot/fear/whatever.  ... I could go on forever. Only thing about Locks... they are slow, really slow.
---
Again, you are not understanding my point, no let's not do that. You got original Vanilla and many people also want original WoTLK and BC, to ask for changes to those expansions but none to Vanilla itself is imo hypocritical.
---
There’s no way classic feels smaller than retail. In retail you just sit in the same city the whole time or go to one or two places for the whole expansion. Also you rarely see anyone outside of cities.
---
You sound like the offended one.
---
It wont lag normally but when you get to ST and drown the hole youll still drop down to 5fps
---
The thrill of helping undead players by buffing them with underwater breathing keeps me going.
---
Oh now I’m buying foot pedals
---
Yup. They shouldn't even bother with "gauging interest for TBC servers". They should be using Classic as a fresh start because if they go forward with a TBC server then at what point do they finally decide "yeah this is where we will start to make new content if people want it".
---
I think I will go warlock then mostly because it seems like it's the less popular class.
---
What are you rolling?
---
I'd love to buy a print of this. Please tell me your going to sell us this. Love it.
---
never heard of you
---
You’ll be fine out in the world, however in Ironforge you gunna be lagging big time into the pit!
---
because you suck
---
Nah I mean you can't blame them for thinking BfA isn't fun.
---
You do but you can still keep your pet you like.
---
Her hands were so light! I should have known! Just Dwarven women from now on ...Stoneform gets rid of ANYthing...
---
How do you go Engi/something else when you need a constant supply of ore for consumables from Engi? Not like you can make a 35 alt to mine with since thorium is a high-level mat.
---
rockfury bracers..  you had too much free time....
---
I use them to select party members for healing in 5 mans. My heals are right below them so any delay from having to slightly move my hand is negigable.
---
Treasure finding is. I loved my dwarf rogue in vanilla!
---
I don’t get why they rebuilt Auberdine to do nothing with it. Auberdine should have been the Alliance Warfrobt base instead of those random ruins.
---
&gt; I was wondering is they are a good competition for orcs in PvP. 
---
Not at all. Orc is by far superior. Stun Resist is so good.
---
&gt; on the other hand being able to hit those mages/locks/hunters from  further away sounds like a great thing especially cuz they are the  classes with which warriors struggle the most. 
---
This is one of those things which does sound good on paper, but in actual BGs it won't make a difference in most scenarios. Meanwhile resisting every 4th stun on you is huge. Especially since most classes only got one stun, which they 'rely' on.
---
Will classic support 4K resolution?
---
If I had gold, I'd give it to you. I was thinking this brought a whole new meaning to stance dance. 2 Stan ce 2 Furious?
---
Well at least you managed to get the stress test when it was available, I didn't even get that smh...
---
Wow what a trash guy. You did the right thing ganking him and I hope you ganked him a lot more.
---
Made a detailed post about it: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btdvm1/to_clear_up_misconceptions_about_the_night_time/
---
Wow, that sounds like a really interesting "power" is there any limitation? Are they too stupid to fully take advantage of it?
---
Desperate prayer, fear ward, and stoneform could prove to be just as good as an extra dot on a longish cooldown that will get instantly dispelled by enemy paladins in any group setting.
---
Druid fastest leveler? Where did you get that from? Hunter is easily the best.

obviously paladins cant wear the prest tier but just using it as a comparison
---
the paladin set bonus has a decent chunk of spell power and priest has a renew effect on greater heals which im sure is great unless they dont stack (not familar with it)
---
the main dead stat is strength on the paladin set , it does not have much spirit but paladins dont stack spirit
---
honestly i dont think its a game breaking loss if you wear at least 5 piece t2 for the set bonus spell power , after that if you feel like it wear good cloth pieces
---
Engi is the highest dps profession. If you can swing it, engi/mining would be better for pve.
---
I'm not. Don't get me wrong, I really like TBC, but what's the point of possibly doing new content for Vanilla and avoiding what is wrong with retail if they are just going to start a snowball of people asking for servers with different expansions on them?
---
Regardless which conventional lvling spec you will choose.
---
Or adopting
---
First character I ever created in 2005 was Tauren druid. I am maining that same druid today. I am super exited to create that same character after almost 15 years. I am even going to use my original name.
---
This will be awesome
---
You do need revered for the cost reduction
---
It really was though, pal. Chill out.
---
Autohotkey
---
That's not true at all. The rogues absolutely do literally turn near invisible, some can kinda see them like humans with their perception bonus and hunters, but they are see through and very hard to detect for most.

People misremember because nights were fucked from Cata to Legion, however they're fixed now. Did an in-depth thread about it: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btdvm1/to_clear_up_misconceptions_about_the_night_time/

Hi, /u/mody_bird_s
---
Which one would you rather drive on a daily basis? Shit meme.
---
Same, problem is the older I get the less likely it is I'll be able to stand up after a gaming session.
---
Jesus
---
Ours had been active since December and the group name is “barrens chat”
---
Yes. Seems like most people go ice though for the cc. Perfect for pvp and still great in pve. Fire is popular for pve and arcane isn't unused. Every mage spec is viable which is a rarity for vanilla classes.
---
It heals the lowest HP in range then jumps to the next person in range, 3 targets I believe.
---
You buy the mats with the gold you make from herbalism and whatever else you make gold from. The point is, those people who go Herbalism with Engineering are doing it, because it’s the gathering profession which can make the most gold, and they know what they’re doing. They know the farm routers for Black lotus’ and know whatever low level herbs are worth picking up.
---
True
---
One thing to keep in mind is that druids didn't have an 'out of combat' rez in vanilla.  It can make five mans a bit frustrating.
---
For raids, priests have a mana regen of 5, versus a Druid's 4.5, so a priest will get more mana from innervate than you will.
---
Depending on your raid group, you may be expected to innervate a priest instead of using innervate on yourself.  
---
Healing in vanilla revolved around downranking spells (using Healing touch 2,4 or 6 etc depending on how hurt someone is) to conserve mana.  Hots were nice to keep people topped off, but a person can only have one rejuvenation on them at a time, so you'll want to coordinate if there's other druids to prevent you overwriting eachother's spells.
---
Tier 2 has a lot of MP5 (mana every five seconds) on it that helped out with mana concerns, but before that we had a healer rotation: priests would heal until OoM, then druids, then shamans so that priests would get to stop casting and start regenerating mana (if you don't cast for five seconds you're mana starts to regen in combat).  Priests went first because they innately regenerated the most mana.
---
I remember grinding lumberjacks in western plagues to level my warrior to 60 while blasting this song on repeat. I was singing along to it and my dad thought I had lost my mind.
---
It’s 300 on pservers, don’t know about 1.12 retail.
---
Would you say a 1070ti could run classic on a 27 inch 4K 144hz without problems?
---
That’s definitely not a bad idea.  And then just keep stuff like character models/animations separate from environment graphics so people don’t have to go all in on updated graphics if they just want new environment graphics but not character models or something like that.
---
&gt;since people hit end-game quickly and there were no updates
---
This is my concern for Classic, it'll never ever change once all the content is available.  I like knowing that something new is in the works on retail, and there will be some new stuff to play.  Sure, it may be easier and less time consuming now, but I like to have fresh new stuff to do. 
---
I enjoyed my time back then, and it may be fun to re-live that, but I'll never get those experiences back exactly.  I'm not a fan of replaying games once I'm done with them either, so I am a bit biased.  I know beating an MMO isn't really a thing like most console games, but Classic can sort of be beaten at some point and that just doesn't appeal to me.
---
Anyone else leaning towards Mage simply because there are going to be so many Warriors and Rogues and it will be a major QoL feature to be able to counter them in wpvp and not have to worry about getting ganked so much?
---
Never human as I play one in real life—boring! When I get overwhelmed by wanting to do all the things, I ask myself that very question: if I could only play one, which would I play? My answer is druid every time because they can play any of the trinity roles and I prefer the flexibility of being a jack of all trades, shapeshifting adds more texture to the experience, and I identify more with nature than holiness.
---
If the undead are an abomination to you, and you also like the option of dealing damage, healing, or being tanky with one class, a human paladin sounds like a good fit.
---
You could, you know, give some reasons for your claim rather than just expect him to trust some random guy on the internet.
---
Thats a... solid reasoning I must admit
---
Because it instills fear in the leveler. It gives the game another dimension.
---
I’m just over here trying to figure out who the hell doesn’t like gnomes
---
Dictation foot pads are $50 on Amazon
---
No, for every game. Animations are literally an aspect of gameplay...
---
I do agree. I think gaming is an underrated beneficial mental activity.
---
I had a 390 frost mage in my 6 key while on an alt. I’m assuming he was one of these and a steering wheel since he was pulling about 4K dps.
---
You’re a moron. They’re clearing out inactive low levels daily. Esfand/Asmon literally just made rule for inviting anyone has to be 25+ 
---
I’m in the guild, since day one, ran multiple  instances with Them. You don’t even have beta. Sit the fuck down shut the fuck up.
---
Min-max in which area? wPvP, BG, PvE tanking, PvE healing, PvE DPSing?
---
Human paladin is a great PvE healer, but dwarf paladin outperforms him in most of the PvP situations.
---
Night elf warrior is not a minmaxed warrior.
---
Orc shaman is not a minmaxed shaman for PvE but from a certain point of view they're best shamans for PvP.
---
Tauren warrior is not a minmaxed warrior.
---
The peninsula in STV that Grom'gol Base Camp, and the nesingwary expedition are on. Also gurubashi arena.
---
You just keep proving yourself ignorant and wrong with every post you make. Yeah, if those guys aren't yet rank 14 on their server then I can guarantee that at that point no one will yet be.
---
Have a cry
---
you need to clean your room more than once every 15 years asmongold
---
As holy priest doing dungeons and quests, is it possible to level up enchanting by doing disenchanting mostly?
---
Unless u drove manual and street race......
---
Are there any good loot council guides for classic? This may seem like a dumb question but our guild is looking to take raiding somewhat serious but it's very difficult to figure out what makes a fair loot council.
---
If only there was a way to play a version of the game that had this art and a bunch of QoL features with new content on a schedule...
---
I hate those prerequisite assessment tests on the first day. "Here's 10 questions on material you never covered in Calc II and Algorithms. I know you took those classes 2 years ago but try your best!"
---
Then the next class after the professor read through the completed tests: "...so what *did* you cover in those classes? Who taught them? I will be speaking to the department..."
---
I agree, a bit. However, people will want to try different specs and adjust just for fun. Also, boss fights weren’t as complex and require a lot less perfection, rather more caution, especially in dungeons. In pvp specs will change too. People are going to piss away so much gold just to adjust a few points for pvp, or they won’t and suffer the consequences. 
---
Also, there is so much more knowledge and communication outside of the game, new baddies will learn faster and/or the epicINgame folks can meet up with other epicINgame folks a lot more easily.
---
Feral DPS is possible, but it isn't that great. It requires a lot of consumables, perfect rotations, and Pally buffs to still not be near the top of the charts. Its definitely doable though, if you're 100% committed to the idea.
---
Resto is pretty simple. You mostly cast Rank 4 Healing Touch. Maybe pepper in some HoTs on the raid. I think Paladin is probably the only healer simpler. Resto Druid is a pretty chill raiding experience imo
---
Yeah I've been eyeing one for Squad for use in its 3 different voice channels.
---
&gt; underrated beneficial mental activity.
---
The people who underrate are usually dumbfucks who would be utterly lost if they were tasked with gaming a DnD system, or the mechanics of an RPG.
---
I'm so beyond sick of this issue.  What you say completely shuts down every argument that can be made for vc.  There is no other dm.  How could anyone assume dire maul if there is no ENW next to it.
---
sometimes it's annoying that you need party members nearby to summon
---
You have my express permission to quote me. My faith is too low and also I'm a bit high.
---
I don't think they should bother with TBC or WotLK altered expansions. They should do completely new expansions where they are very transparent about what features and QoL stuff they are adding all while actively listening to player feedback from the people that are still playing Classic when the time comes. A second timeline with no increased level caps, just 60.
---
Between those two specs, do you think the deep Resto/Feral Charge is the better/more versatile spec?
---
I'm kinda leaning toward that one because I feel like I'd get more mileage out of it for PvE ad well, even though PvP will be the main focus of it.
---
Well on at least one or two of the private server launches they had like 10k pop on launch even with dynamic respawns you are standing in a circle around each spawn point with 5 guys mashing right click. But on live classic, from what I experienced in the stress test it didnt seem that bad.
---
Skill ups from disenchanting cap out at like 50 or 75.
---
This dude has never seen a Druid vs pally fight.
---
That's bad ass
---
Did the old PvP system go for realm-based honor pool, or did that change with x-realm bgs?
---
:|
---
Man I see you lost faith but also I see your fast and long detailed responses and its obvious you are passionate about it and want it to be better for everyone. Please consider making a post here or on the forums, this seems like a big deal, maybe you need to dumb it down for people or something
---
&gt; Actually WoW was REALLY fucking dark waaay back before 1.2.
---
Yea yea sure, but Inky Black potion is -seriously- dark. It's as dark as it gets.
---
Wowhead lists everything that existed before the site was started as "1.13"
---
The red circle with an arrow pointing to it is an instant turn off.
---
Yeah tone is blatantly obvious through text. 
---
Proves my point already by how you circle jerkers just assume I'm being dead serious as well lol
---
Doesn't change the fact
---
I believe they do disappear after 30 days, if you open the mail. I don't remember what happens if you don't open it.
---
fyi he now has an alliance guide that will be released fully before launch :)
---
Vanilla is really easy to learn. Newbies will be fine.
---
If I make a Night Elf in classic what’s the best way to get to Elwynn forest to start questing? I’m assuming from the posts I’ve seen there’s no boat from Darn to SW?
---
I'm gonna main enhancement shaman fully knowing that it's dps contribution is considered low but has okay group buffs.  If they ever decide to buff the underperforming classes I likely wouldn't mind and at the same time I won't mind if they don't touch a thing.  I know my class won't be something likely desired by a progression guild but it's what I want to play so I will.
---
Better not to, stick to the night elf zones and darkshore
---
Hardware most likely
---
Sounds like an average huntard tbh
---
The druid thing is called innervate btw
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p5UcxQKFG4M check out this one too!
---
Really depends on how layering works. In very crowded starting zones, it can take a little under an hour to get to level 5, which is about the time it takes to get to 5 on pure exploration XP.
---
This is incorrect. The original DDR came out on the PS1 9/26/98.
---
I mean, what class / spec / role do you pick Tauren over any other choice?
---
Decent attempt at a shop at least. Effort was put forth.
---
Unless your a drummer lol
---
Back in the day the Warrior was THE tank class if I'm not mistaken. Palladins/Druids were frowned upon as tanks,
---
God damn I love that staff
---
Yes it would be fine. The spec well be 30/0/21 or 31/0/20. You lose some mana efficiency and mana tide, and you probably want to use the talents to make healing wave better, so you'll be a little worse in pvp than pure pvp ele spec which is primarily lesser healing wave.
---
Yes. Any class can heal any dungeon with any spec as long as they're wearing appropriate healing gear.
---
What's worse, the people trying to give feedback to Blizzard on all of the terrible stuff they added that has resulted in their downward spiral of subscriptions, or the people that think retail is perfectly fine because the people that have invested too much money in it to quit are ok with Queue Simulator: The MMORPG?
---
Not going to lie, it looks good and I would buy it as well.
---
You will be able to heal, but if you think that you will be able to wreck faces as elemental without raid gear then there are some bad news for you.
---
I believe classic is all about communication. You could always alert your group to take good measures in order to prevent failures/wipes. Your tank could equip a better hp/armor gear or have that feral/lockpet/hunterpet or whatever off tanking 1 target at times. The short answer is yes, but really depends on your group/your gear. Shaman have really good toolkit for any situation so you need to adapt and so your group.
---
I just bind zerker to 3 and WW to 3, so I just mash the 3 button, 4 for battle and 4 for overpower etc. I lose out on some keys I guess but it works well for me, I also bind zerker and battle to my mouse buttons if I want to switch for other reasons like intercept or zerker rage
---
You think Vanilla wasn't like this in upper raiding echelons?
---
If anything, there will be *more* flexibility after pserver innovation and the emergent "simplicity" of raiding brought forth by both 1.12 talents and larger player knowledge bases. You're still not likely going to see a Moonkin in a progression guild, but Fury Warriors are in the vogue, SPriests can get niche slots, Mages have broadened spec alterations, Druids have new mana-intensive HoT specs instead of being Innervate bots, etc. Classic will still have some pigeonholing simply because class specs are not homogenized, and thus certain specs can be argued as "mathematically superior" for one reason or another. But I suspect it won't be as bad as you fear.
---
What was seen I’ll probably never be able to unsee
---
This is vanilla wow, people used to get by just clicking the abilities. Y'all pretend like it's a fast paced game smh
---
Back in '02 I had an Army NCO that had a PT regiment that consisted entirely of DDR.
---
Probably better to just group up and go grind level 3-5 mobs outside of the starter zone.
---
My point is that it looks bad. That's literally it. 
---
To clarify even further:
---
The (Animation) looks (bad) ((((to me)))).
---
Have you considered using another system? DKP for example?
---
I've always considered Loot Councils problematic in that they're subjective and you can really upset people. The beauty of DKP is that any fault lies in either the oversubscription of a particular role, or the other person using their points to buy an item you want.
---
Really don't see the point. With a keypad-style mouse (naga, g600, etc) you get 14 buttons x 8 modifier combinations = 112 unique assignable keys within thumb's reach.
---
Ele is known for being a mana hungry spec...
---
Sure a supercomputer could run wow, but you would still get better performance from a highend dedicated gaming pc. Supercomputers are loaded with lots of multicore processors running at lower clockspeeds whereas gaming pc's have lower core count but a lot higher clockspeeds.
---
I remember elite pets having better stats back in vanilla, is/was this the case? Or did it get normalized in a later patch?
---
He asked about how to do it, WTF kind of answer is that?
---
&gt; exploration leveling is a meme
---
During vanilla, before the game had teleport protection, you could get to level 12 by just teleporting all over the game for exploration XP extremely quickly.
---
*RESIST* *MISS* *RESIST* *RESIST*

To echo basically everyine else -- I also would love to purchase a print. Would you look into getting a good scan of this and selling? You've got one customer right here! (And by the looks of it, many more than just me!)

---
This entire city must be purged.
---
So fucking sick of videos. God damn.
---
No one wants to watch a 16 minute video of how to get to Tanaris from Darnassus as alliance, or how to complete quest xyz.
---
Just let me glance through and skim over a page if text. Infinitely better.
---
Some people arent as secure with themselves as you are.
---
Because the people that still play retail are the same people that ruined the game. Everytime they have tried to revert certain features it results in a massive media outcry.
---
Overpower cant be dodges or parries, only missed.
---
Interesting... Tbh I am not that stressed about pvp, but I do want to be viable and since me goal is the tier 0.5 which is not cheap. Am I going to suffer at just standard gold farm aswell? Or are you talking min/max pvp here?
---
Yeah, but are both moons in the sky?

Vanilla was realm-based! Not sure what to expect in classic.
---
i guess.  Not really my thing i suppose.  Guess im just more of an honourable dual kind of guy than a roaming bandit.
---
And still priv server players have a million more buffs lol 😂😂
---
Amazing. Thank you for your work and time out into this.
---
Oh Shit I forgot about that. Azeroth had two moons and then one just disappeared.
---
*"Biggie Smalls feat. Thomas the Tank Engine"* starts playing *LOUD*
---
what i did when i was leveling is i would mail them to a bank alt and have it sit in mail for a while, then simply press the return button on all the mail on the bank alt then mail it back agian and keep it in mail limbo until i wanted the stuff
---
This was really well put together! C'thuns awesome but something about Yogg Saron is cooler imo. Maybe its because i loved Ulduar so much.
---
My favorite moment is gaming was when we all rolled Taurens, made a guide called, "Brotherhood of the blade" and spent whole days in duskwood. We would hide in a bush and put target dummies on the road. It would confuse tf out of new players. Especially when you see 3 taurens running out of a small bush.
---
Eventually that would lead to level 60s coming in to kill our lvl 30-35 asses. We would hide in the scattered houses and it would feel like a horror movie hiding from these higher levels.
---
Best memories ever.
---
No, but i shall
---
Holy-reck pally, do u have a opinion about they?
---
I leveled a druid in Vanilla and will probably do so again in Classic. I highly recommend you play how you want. Be prepared that as feral you will compete with rogues for gear in dungeons and raids, they may even try to take leather with intellect on it if the other stats improves their build in any way. It's probably rogues saying druids can only heal. :)
---
The 31-point talent in the feral tree is a crit buff for ranged and melee party members. Much of a vanilla druid's usefulness in groups was bringing buffs and utility.
---
Another thing to be prepared for is carrying multiple sets of gear, so plan for a lot of bag space!
---
They've been really really picky with what they consider to be "what most players remember." Their stance on which AV version they're using really rubs me wrong especially.
---
Yep I remember internet fondly back in the late 90s due to Diablo 1/Warcraft 2/starcraft then UT99 and that was 4-5 years before WoW. Guides, Forums, IRC channels everywhere.
---
How many warlocks do you usually see? Most raids on private servers I would never see more than 4 or 5
---
Take my gold.
---
Just kidding I don't have any. But I'm told it's the thought that counts.
---
R u srs? I had no idea not everyone could parry
---
as others said, no.
---
in fact classic wow is the anti-min maxer version of wow.
---
there's so much content and stuff to do outside of the top raids, and the entry level raids are easily puggable after a while as well.
---
I usually see 5-7.
---
*Come on motherfuckers, come on* (4x)
---
"haha im an idiot and got made fun of and downvoted to shit i was trolling this whole time haha xd ur triggered"
---
&gt;	That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we’re sending out is rapidly decreasing
---
Maybe I’m just illiterate but I’m pretty sure that means they’re dwindling down invites but they’re not quite done.
---
It wasn't wowhead but some classic-specific database. Most information on wowhead is about retail so I don't even check it.  
---
But it did helped me figure out what is exactly 1.13:  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=288097/world-of-warcraft-classic-patch-1-13-build-28211](https://www.wowhead.com/news=288097/world-of-warcraft-classic-patch-1-13-build-28211)   
---
When I first seen "1.13" I thought back in a days there was some TBC pre-patch but that is technically still Vanilla (don't remember how it was; wasn't paying attention to anything back then).
---
Unfortunately I haven't watched enough streams to notice that...hopefully there are, and if not, I hope they bring them back before August!
---
I liked taking my orcs and tauren to the undead starting zone. I get the most feels leveling over there.
---
I was leaning heavily towards druid because druid has always been my jam.
---
But there is just something about totems and the flavour of shaman that I just cannot shake.
---
As it is right now, I'm leaning more towards shaman than anything right now. But we'll see how I feel tomorrow.
---
My turn to post this tomorrow
---
If you have done most of the content in game post wrath, you are good to go for classic. The only things you need to get used to is the time commitment and corpse runs.
---
It wasn't even in wrath man.
---
You should go Alliance for sure. Always go with class fantasy/aesthetics over trival things like leveling dungeon access.
---
Don't forget Alliance has closer to the raids and end game dungeons! Plus I personally loved levelling through Darkshore/Loch Modan/Duskwood. Also Paladins are amazing to have in your party, both for PvP and PvE. Strongest PvP healer. Humans/Nelfs are some of the best looking races too. And you can get a cool item to turn into a furbolg... :D
---
I'm Horde by heart, but I can tell that you like looking at Alliance characters/cities more so go with them! And as I mentioned they have a lot of pros too. You should choose the faction that resonates best with you! (And from reading your comments that is Alliance)
---
Is anything transferable from the Beta to the release version?
---
If not then then aside from potentially meeting your favourite streamer is there no/minimal difference between playing the beta or just playing on a private server?
---
On some *non-retail* server i clearly remember practice manikin would chase you through whole city even if you just ran by without hitting him. He would chase you and oneshot you somewhere near the auctioneer in stormwind
---
Honestly don't understand why the ones that are downvoting the people that wants the animation to remain as it was back in Vanilla.   
---
I'm assuming most are non Rogue players. Like how dare people want their stealth animation to be as it was back then! Next up; warrior charge animation tweaked, Shaman stomping totems makes a different sound, Warlock pet summoning gives a different glow, etc.  
---
Keeping in mind Rogues are in stealth a considerable amount of time I get it. Things need to remain as it was, as it indeed is a part of the immersion feel.
---
What about a rogue with a priest backing him up for heals, shield, and dispel?
---
haha I can't tell if he's trying to reinforce the meme or validate the strat HELP
---
These are stance macros.
---
As a lvling warrior or a private vanilla server right now: why am I doing this? Why do ai hate myself so much? Y live at all? Ive experienced hard lvling, but the vanilla warrior experience is truely terrible.
---
Yeah I could never get myself to level a Rogue very far in Vanilla.  I think the highest I got was into the 20's.
---
Where you get these? I've always wanted for pedals for gaming lol
---
This is anti clicker scrub
---
You just went straight from born to perpetual loser, didn't you boi?
---
Rogues who have played beta, is aggro range in stealth similar to private servers? I played the typical combat swords lvling spec rogue to 30 on pserver  but may consider putting a point or two into improved stealth this time around due to pulling mobs in stealth frequently. 
---
Going off this question, how many points are necessary into improved stealth to see a difference?
---
Thanks buddy appreciate it !
---
I bought a usb numpad and bound all the keys to push to talk and put it on the floor. It's much cheaper than these pedals.
---
It's from vanilla

Flying is a cool mechanic but it does hurt the game no matter how you slice it. It completely removes player interaction with other players, environment threats, and allows you to just skip over sections at the expense of "I can fly!"

Pretty awful. This is going into the territory where it affects gameplay because no one can see shit.

You get to choose who you want to raid with. You get to choose the guild you want to raid in. And you can choose them based on their requirements for raiding.
---
There will be many very, very bad players. The playerbase will be worse than retail on average. Many people will be playing that haven't gamed or played WoW in over a decade. I have no problem with them doing their thing. That being said if you have played this game for a while at a pretty high level, I suggest you stay clear or get the hell out as fast as possible if you find yourself in a bad guild or "squad".
---
Same, dude. I remember using this guide to level up in Teldrassil back when I started playing WoW.
---
the only cool part of flying was being a druid and insta shifting into flight form and soaring off into the air
---
god damn that never stopped being fucking cool. TBC was truly the greatest time to be a druid
---
What rock have you been under for the last year and a half?
---
0.5 is a fine set of gear, I used quite a few pieces at times in vanilla. I don't think it will be in the game for awhile though.
---
You just need to get used to using your bank primarily to hold gear as you will have tons of pieces to juggle to get everything just right.
---
Unless I’ve heard wrong, most Pservers have adjusted the bosses to have more health and what not than vanilla.  Even with the increased health they apparently kill bosses in stupid fast times, simply because people know what they’re doing a bit more than they did back in vanilla.
---
Because of this, I’d say unless you’re in an elitist guild, any spec should be able to raid and get shit done.  
---
I’ve seen people calling for blizzard to make the classic bosses harder for the above reason, but I feel like it should just be left alone specifically so people won’t be forced into cookie cutter builds and what not
---
On pServers each Point is equally to one lvl in Stealth.
---
how is the game so far in upholding how the original game is? if it is possible I want to hear the pro and con, specifically about servers cross, sharding etc..
---
Yep that’s vanilla. The challenges were very different back then. Very few classes had to be extremely mechanically skilled, but the organizational effort to progress was immense.
---
Its more about getting the ux, data and frontend correct than the algorithm now. I'm using shortest distance algorithms yes, with a graphql server - frontend is just static files :)
---
Here's a thread from September of 2018 requesting the second moon be brought back in the game: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769467004
---
So unfortunately it looks like it's been removed from the client on which classic is based as well.
---
If you want to pve as well then go the deep resto spec. Gotta say though moon glow is really fun for me.
---
“We don’t let warriors DPS with shields out”
---
*equips this shield*

“Ok we’ll make an exception because that shield looks is very polite”

Oh yeah that's true!

Pocket healer for a rogue. Stealth team ftw.
---
For Shadow Priest PVP, which race is better? Dwarf or Undead?
---
The client we’re playing is based off 7.3.5, the moon was re-added in 5.4.
---
/random, keep it classic!
---
Pretty undeniable takes a lot of skill and micro skills to play Druid. But omg those fights are so long idk man, you gotta be in it for the long haul to Druid wPvP. 😂
---
Haha rolling about individual characters is the only time VC can be called VC.
---
Only what i will missing from retail is that hot model ...😟
---
Ulduars actually my favorite raid in wow! Yogg made the curse of the flesh which is probably the single most impactful event in the history of wow. Definitely gives him points lol.
---
It's not bad tbh. It helps you win vs rogue undead priests and warrior.
---
Gnome is stronger ofc, but dwarf is pretty cool as rogue.
---
They shoot fat doinks and are really fun to play
---
i just use my thumb mouse button yall are weird
---
Holy Paladin, but I alternated between priest in mage in vanilla with a couple of alts.
---
Loved Ferahgo back in the day. That was when Druids were basically seen as free kills and he became our defiant talisman. I still think [this](https://youtu.be/i2Fm3_I0UMo) one is is most iconic video. Sure, he became a better player as time went on but this one was huuuuge when it dropped. All of a sudden we found out that it was *somehow* possible for druids to actually gank people.
---
Ah, I didn't do caster dps till tbc, I just remembered healbot being broken by changes to stopcasting like the second week ZG was out.
---
I was fine with the change, that mod turned raid  healing into a literal "push button every 2 seconds to win" role.
---
F? 
---
What does that mean? Fsteak?
---
Time to upgrade to a desktop.
---
He sounds like Randal from Clerks
---
My bad, I didn't realize the linked thread is actually *classic* discussion from September, way before we had beta client! My apologies! It's getting late here.
---
glad you like it - ofc! hope it's useful in your adventures!
---
&gt; He lists engineering as "very expensive" to level. It's a pretty easy &amp; inexpensive prof to level.
---
Depends on how fast you are at making gold and if you have to rely on buying mats off the AH or try to do a self-sustenance route with multiple characters.
---
I’d buy one if you sell em!
---
Just use f1 f2 f3 bro
---
&gt; Shadow spec priests are fast levelers, very respectable speeds. Not going shadow means you lose all that speed.
---
You know you don't pick a "spec" in Vanilla, right? Even if you wanted to level as holy (which no one does because there's no point), you would still get 5/5 wand spec, improved SW:P and improved PW:S. So you end up with the same spec either way unless you're intentionally trying to gimp yourself. This is basically a shitpost that says "if you don't take any of the talents that help you level, Priests are shitty levelers."
---
Also, your comment reads like a Trump tweet.
---
can be really bad to do that for long periods of time though so don't feel too bad
---
https://youtu.be/4V0TYIO6yv4
---
How pathetic are you
---
Can you please explain to me the difference between layering and sharding
---
0.5 came with AQ if I remember correctly? I am pretty sure however it will be in the game once I have hit 60 and gotten all the pieces I need for it. Stinky casual me :) 
---
No kinda what I was expecting that gameplay while healing, I enjoy the style. But I do not enjoy the inability to farm outside of dungeons (my first 60 was a holy priest, switched to lock) so I was hoping elemental shaman would be able to bridge that gap
---
I was a ret paladin in vanilla and I get the sense that Shamans are like more offensive paladins. so reverse logic would be Paladins are a bit like more defensive Shamans. You'll always have more defensive utility than offense but I don't regret rolling that class at all
---
To be honest, I don’t see myself in one of those guilds, so maybe I shouldn’t care. I think that I will take some time to look over the engineering items to see what I can get, then decide on it. 
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
yeah I'm still gonna have to disagree, that was not a convincing argument at all
---
Thats great and all, but I prefer to play in the most optimal way possible, and a USB foot switch isn't that. If you want to click abilities, go for it. I don't.
---
Hm.. where they say that? I musta missed that, just curious.
---
how many servers will there be when Classic laaunches? will there be just 1 pvp and 1 pve?
---
&gt; changing vanilla into the Burning Crusade or creating new content will be more agreeable to classic players than not changing the game and leaving it as-is
---
I'm not sure about that. There is a point where the server does all that there is to do in classic, and I think that private servers show that people enjoy new classic servers because a server-wide reset to the beginning is fun. But not everybody wants to lose their progress, so a season system with no modifications to gameplay would be a way to facilitate that. Want a fresh start? Get in at the start of the next classic season. Don't want to participate in a reset and lose all progress? Don't do anything, nothing happens to your server. Nevermind where the concept is used elsewhere, it's not an in-game system. Just a way to keep static content fresh indefinitely.
---
Jokes on them I was only pretending
---
Petopia now has a nice Classic site with lots of nice data on pets and skills.  I used it to brush up mine. 
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Ohh boy, a 1 in 4 chance to have a racial that does anything. Let's just pretend like this is anywhere as good as a racial stun, or a dps cooldown that scales with gear.
---
The CirOrcJerk has gotten embarrassing. Orc is an ok racial set for warriors, and that's pretty much it.
---
If its dumb and it works, its not dumb lol. I love it dude.
---
Druids are capable of raid tanking. Not just while leveling up or one off bosses.
---
The reason amon thinks he loses duels pepelaugh

---
You’re right, tone can be hard to read over text, it’s a good thing we have something called context though which can easily be read via text. The guys name is also like assasshehe.
---
Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot.
---
Right, but 10k players on kalimdor is not a problem unless they're all in the same few zones.  As soon as players start hitting 30-ish and can choose to go to several different zones, the competition for mobs won't be nearly as severe.
---
Two issues, it is a Linux server and I don't think the Itanium 2 has integrated graphics.
---
Most classes do not have anything resembling a modern DPS rotation.  
---
Here's the basic single target DPS rotation for the primary DPS classes sorted from least complex to most complex:
---
1. Warlock/Mage: Frostbolt/Shadowbolt on single target and use cooldowns/items/trinkets as appropriate.  
---
2. Rogue: Sinister strike plus combo point spenders, eviscerate &amp; slice and dice.
---
3. Hunter: Auto shot -&gt; aimed shot -&gt; auto shot -&gt; multi-shot -&gt; auto-shot -&gt; aimed shot -&gt; auto shot -&gt; multi-shot... the pendulum always ticks back and forth.
---
4. Warrior. The actual rotation is simple, just use whirlwind and bloodthirst on cooldown. The complexity comes from managing rage well and knowing when and how to best spend excess rage vs. changing stance for overpower procs.
---
There are other classes with varying degrees of complexity when it comes to DPS rotation, I can list those if you wish.
---
yea Classic can run well even on toasters
---
Wetlands could be tough for a level 1. Consider unequipping your gear there, to avoid durability costs.
---
Since that post, only F&amp;F invites have trickled in.
---
We need patriot arrow
---
Ele is a good open world spec, though not as good as anything a warlock does or other classes that farm well. Bring lots of water, you'll kill a few mobs then need to drink.
---
This specific chip set runs at 2.5 ghz
---
You k iw what I mean. Don't play coy, it's quite unbecoming.
---
Thanks~
---
Orc warrior is better pve and pvp
---
If your testing things, I wouldn't test it in a full tier 3 set. For one, at that point you've finished Naxx several times and there isn't more content for you. 
---
Most of your time raiding isn't going to be in Tier 3 gear, and for most classes you're not wearing a full Tier set at all. I'm not sure about Druid or Paladin, but most classes BiS wasn't tier gear.
---
I'm excited to play classic. I never really got to play the beginning of retail. I did play BC and each xpac for maybe a couple months each but always burnt out.
---
That feeling you had of fire balling wolves, I have that exact feeling with everquest. Being a monk outside of freeport just slaying the shit out of some snakes. getting new skills and testing them out. Or being in crushbone. Good times
---
A tear just rolled down my cheek. That was my first time seeing that.
---
Real OG hangout Darnassus.  Chill there, watch the occasional level 8 run by to drop off a quest, chill there some more...
---
...
---
So much to do...
---
I enjoyed printing gold. I know it's stupid, I know as a "real gamer" I shouldn't be falling for that shit, I haven't played a single 'Facebook game' in my life, but hey, they got me. 
---
Jokes on them though, as I made so much gold I'd never really have to pay a sub again. 
---
I thought the raids were kinda better. We still have another raid to go with BFA (or 2? Dunno) and while they're not bad, Blackrock Foundry still kind of sits above all of them as far as I'm concerned. 
---
Don't PvP so dunno about that. 
---
I don't think one is really better than the other though. They both suffer from similar problems and were entertaining enough in shorter bursts, but there just wasn't (and can't be, I think) enough content to stay engaged continuously through the whole expansion.
---
Oooh rah yutt kill. ;)
---
Gung ho, brother. :)
---
This may be the reddit comment of the year!
---
Really this is how you should be sitting anyway.
---
Female, lol. Extrapolation via context not big in your country?
---
Same boat. Though I started in BC but never played for more than a month or 2 at a time. Really pumped about it
---
but that ain't fun.
---
thank you for the reply. I was doing math in my head and thinking OMG I'LL NEVER HAVE TIME TO DO ALL THE THINGS.  Sounds like I might!
---
Same boat, I did play cataclysm for a bit because it allowed me to level a new character with brand new environments/quests in the zones I used to love. But the handholding/instancing of the questlines just made it boring and cookie cutter.
---
Am I the only one who get the sarcasm? OP is making fun of the countless "will it run classic" shitposts. Wake up geeks
---
Bruh I have Ctrl+F bound
---
Do you not care about PvE, or why do you avoid a direct question about what exactly do you want to minmax? Reckbombing is quite niche, I wouldn't say that there's anything holyrecks are "best" at.
---
Are you ready to nolife? Because if you do, you can minmax 2 sides of the game with 2 specs, but the gold grind will be tough.
---
A bad shaman dies to a rogue with their 5 button rotation.
---
We dont know exact numbers, but there will be more than 2. It'll be a bit fuzzy at the beginning due to layering. Also likely that there wont be enough servers to handle the amount of initial interest, but it'll equalize in a few months after launch one way or another: less players or  more servers.
---
Female
---
Haha I wondered the same thing myself. Fact of the matter is I don’t really game anymore and I gave up on blizzard years ago, so my lines of communication with that world were pretty much all cut off. Any fantasy experience I’ve had in the past 5-10 years have mainly been via fantasy literature and the occasional Xbox game. 
---
I’m back!!!!
---
but ele shaman isn't a healer..
---
During vanilla I completely min/max’d a lvl 49 ele shaman and it was the most broken thing I’ve ever played in a game. I would regularly one shot multiple people at a time with a proc off chain lightening. I was basically a tank &amp; FC as well with how strong my heals were and ghost wolf.
---
"Fun of leveling" is such an arbitrary metric that I'd just leave it out next time. For many people, the difficulty of leveling a warrior only adds to the fun.
---
y
---
Did you stack spell crit on the paladin? Holy paladins have a lot of sustain with spell crit as they get 100% mana back from critical heals
---
No, you will OOM so fast and piss your group off
---
F1 for auto run is cozy
---
&gt;  That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we’re sending out is rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for testing. We’ll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.
---
 Can’t decide on 2k 27inch or 4K 27 inch, I’d be interested if anyone has played on both and has a preference
---
Except context still isn't tone.
---
I'll spell this one out for you so it's perfectly clear, you're retarded
---
"You think you do, but you don't." Where have I heard that before?
---
Why mods delete previous post of this?
---
Yep. You can raid heal as ele/resto once your guild is done progressing, not an issue at all. In my experience in most PvP guilds all the healers are PvP specced as long as they're not progression raiding because there's no need for the extra efficiency from talents once you have gear from a farm status raid.
---
R u ok
---
I would honestly rank rogue as worse than warrior.
---
I wonder if getting spirit gear like this guy recommends, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Dn6X2QIZg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Dn6X2QIZg), would increase that ease of levelling score.
---
You could map some of the pads to “Need Loot” and really work up a sweat 😓
---
Why do you need to "commit" to one of them? You can respec your talents at any time, try both of them.
---
Caster hybrids aren't locked like they are post-Wrath. The only thing he'd be missing by going deep Elemental are some efficiency talents.
---
Full tier 3 gear and bis neck and rings ... even with the illumination talent they went oom before the resto druid. The resto druid seems to scale better in tier 3 gear because as I stated before their rank 3 healing touch was healing for the same amount as max rank flash of light for way less mana cost. Druids also get 30% mana back on critical heals from their tier 3 set bonus.
---
YouTube
---
All the dungeons in classic are way easier than the nerfed versions of the cata heroics though. And the raids are mechanically trivial as well compared to even the first tier of cata raids.
---
He said heal gear. Yes, this all assumes he is using his heal set.
---
FoL: 140m 343-384 (~364 avg) healing 1mp per 2.6h
---
R3 HT: 110m 195-244 (~220 avg) healing 1mp per 2h
---
I'm not usually a healer, but if were not counting talents and going by raw output, Paladins are still slightly more efficient.
---
Go in blind
---
Makes me wonder how accurate those are... again :)
---
Yah that's pretty gay but I dont give a FUCK because I dont play the women's class
---
Lol this is actually awesome!
---
Do you jerk to get jerked?
---
Awesome guide
---
The feels are real and the beta is out now and they have done stress tests (one incoming this upcoming week) to a level 10 cap this time around and it was some of the most fun I've ever had and everyone was just capped at level 5, lol
---
Icyveins mc guide for frost mages. Rotation: frost bolt.
---
Correct, not counting talents pally still better. With talents that rank 3 goes to about 85 mana. Both heals were healing in the high 700s per heal.
---
Druids are the gods of efficiency post AQ/Naxxramas.
---
If you want to know what the first year of classic will look like, just put some dungeon blues on because you won't be wearing full T3 until at least 18 months from now if not longer. And that's assuming your guild wants to farm Naxxramas rather than go on hiatus until whatever comes next, actually comes out.
---
Compaq lol
---
So sad people like him had to wait for Beta. But people like shroud. xcq have had it
---
I’m the same, zero vanilla experience but I’m completely hyped! As the comment above says YouTube is your best friend. There’s tonnes of videos like what your looking for! I’ve watched looaads but still can’t decide what faction or class hahaha
---
Youtube is your best bet. Start with some class / race guides then dive deeper into the classes you find interesting. Really shouldnt need more than that
---
I'm not sure he is correct on that one. Might want to double check with some solid sources. I can't think of anything a Warrior would want a slower weapon for, but I'm also no Warrior expert.
---
Yeah, it’s rapidly decreasing because they have have enough people. They didn’t say they aren’t sending out more invites because they are still inviting content creators and F&amp;F. But the average joe like OP won’t be getting in.
---
Oh my god. It’s really happening.
---
I lost all faith in blizzard... but it’s coming back.
---
Don't fall into the trap of stacking too much crit on a Paladin. If you have unspent mana at the end of a boss fight where you could otherwise have done more healing by wearing gear with more bonus healing, it's always better to take the hit to mana efficiency and pump out bigger numbers.
---
Absolutely! Good luck!
---
Yea seems like they are the gods post naxx. Probably still better off with a pally than since tier 3 is so far away unless I'm looking very long term.
---
I’m home.
---
This one.  Try things, make some decisions and enjoy the process!
---
Depends on how long phases take. If theres 6-12 months between phases then I'll no doubt be working an alt. Especially if im on a pvp server where playing an alt gets you away from your main if youre stuck in an unfavorable wpvp situation. Also with an alt on the backburner you can cash in rest XP more easily for a lower /played.
---
Nice thanks!
---
Chill lmfao
---
Revered? Isn't it Honored?
---
You have no source for that
---
I need this!
---
I'm sick of Streamers. All they do is in-fight among themselves, throw insults at each other, stream snipe, bitch about each other playing different factions and how they're going to camp now ex friends until they quit streaming.
---
Don't forget about Illumination, Paly spell crits refund full mana. So once you hit a reasonable level of crit, you'll effectively cut the cost of your spells by your spell crit chance.
---
I never said it was dumbass lol.
---
In the absence of tone, context provides a whole lot of information.
---
No doubt you get yourself into some awkward ass situations considering you still don’t grasp that. Take this thread for instance.
---
Keep digging yourself deeper.
---
🤡
---
I've always thought of doing push to talk like that, does it work well?
---
no progress from the beta is transferable 
---
private servers are a shell of the vanilla experience. a lot of the values are guessed or made up. also it seems like a lot of the servers aren't being taken care of anymore because of the impending release of classic so expect a lot of bugs. if possible, i would wait for classic to come out to get the true experience and not a watered down one.
---
Very cool, but... I feel like just getting a Razer Naga mouse will solve most of your keybind issues - throw in shift and ctrl modifiers and you’ll have enough bind combination to comfortably use even a shaman with all the totems.
---
&gt; Shorter stun cd
---
Deep in the prot tree, would sacrifice holy shock
---
&gt; Interrupt resistance
---
Not specific to holy, can be picked up no matter what
---
&gt; blessing of kings   
---
A Ret paladin can’t be the only paladin in a group for many reasons 
---
&gt; much higher durability  
---
It’s important to note this is only against Physical damage, if you get focused  by melee as a DPS you’re dead no matter what. 
---
Then I got further in your post and you just straight up compared “what’s better a healer who can’t be CC’d or a melee DPS with Stuns?”, the fact is they’re not mutually exclusive. You need melee, and you need healers, none of what you said is a reason not to bring Ret, it’s a reason to bring Holy.
---
I'd say DPS focus more on strength, agility, crit chance, hit chance
---
Tanks focus more on Stamina, Defence, Dodge/block/parry(rare on gear), and strength.
---
The most important thing is to make sure you have a 1h/shield ready, including having decent weapon skill for your 1H.
---
This was factored in I had the illumination talent and full tier 3 so cant get much better than that. The druid still had better efficiency. I'm assuming naxx/aq they just are more efficient.
---
I was thinking about this. Most people who played vanilla wow are probably tipping 30 or older. So who are these spergs who follow streamers around everywhere acting like 12 year olds ? Is it mostly younger retail players or are there actually grown adults acting like this?
---
He's #1 because like I said, he caters to the young audience which comprises most of Twitch viewers. Those younger viewers are a cesspool of autism. Pointing out facts doesn't make a person mad.
---
A dress of JUDGMENT.
---
Let's just say I played a Huntard on a pretty hard-core pserver and I had no issues whatsoever finding a raiding spot in a guild. Pugging was harder to find spots in but very possible if you were first to ask. I wasn't even that good either, just did my best and prepare with consumables and whatever else I was required to have.
---
With the sheer amount of people that will play Classic even the most over populated classes are very viable to find dungeon/raid spots with. Just play what your heart desires. It will work out in the end.
---
Shut up you pretentious ass kid. Who were you again? Cool you ran instances with them! Even if you did, it is probably the closest thing you ever had to a friend you incel. You are right I dont have beta, nothing gets past you sherlock, and if I did i wouldnt be on reddit and be a bitch to other people, instead of actually playing no life dumbass.
---
I wonder how the predictions that not many warriors will make it to 60 will pan out.  I remember it being hard but not *that bad* leveling to 60 on a war.
---
Yes it’s called classic.
---
Esfand, Quin69 - Paladin.
---
You can tank and feral dps just fine. Bear tanks are stronger than warrior in some situations, you are not restricted to healing. However fully utilizing the druid means being able to adapt. You should carry healing gear for encounters that require less tanks, but heavy healing/decursing. In same way as fury warriors carry tank sets should they be required to step in
---
Only stay away from the chicken... it just doesnt work well in vanilla
---
rofl
---
i would recommend going with 2k, 4k isn't really needed for computer monitors. you'll be able to run WoW fine but it will look the same as 2k, and other more demanding games will make your card struggle and this will only get worse as the years go on.
---
for what? lmao i do use them. quit scrubbing the thread up 1999
---
Off tank though. As Mt they struggle to compete in bwl early aq40. Their gear progression is a bit slow during that period. They have more threat than a warrior which makes them a great off tank, but lack fury dps of the warrior off tanks. They are a bit more versatile as they can heal when needed on some bosses which is a nice to have.
---
He can tank you can heal/dps  just breeze all the way to 60
---
Can someone find fura's ridiculous nerd rant about how they were the only guild good enough to do the AQ scepter?
---
(spoiler - they weren't)
---
Good. Go all out.
---
Stamina/armor for tank. Strength/agility for dps. That being said you don’t have to be so rigid about it for leveling and regular dungeon tanking. Really only thing you should keep on hand is a 1 hander and shield to switch to. Maybe a couple items that have a ton of stamina if you happen to run in to any to make it a little easier on your healer.  It’s really not that important to start really having a lot of tank specific gear with defense and avoidance until raiding. It’s more important for you to just know how to hold on to aggro in 5 man pugs.
---
Glad you could [bake it](https://i.imgur.com/Icp1f9U.png), Uther.
---
Thats really surprising. Because the math show's otherwise. Palys have equal or better output and FoL is 1sec faster so you can get heals out nearly twice as fast.
---
I haven't dont the test for myself and I've only raided as a warrior so I don't even have personal experience here, but I've always heard that high level Palys basically never run out of mana.
---
It'll be fine really. You'll be able to fill any roll. It might not be the most efficient because the spriest relies so much killing blows.
---
Were those islands on the original map?
---
Druids aren't bad, they just lag behind a little bit during MC and BWL because Blizzard took a while to figure out how they needed to optimize their gear to make them work well.
---
It gets *a lot* better during AQ and Naxxramas, they really start to shine in the latter half of Classic. And it's not like they're bad prior to that, every raid needs at least one Druid - preferably two or sometimes three.
---
They're not a bad class, you just can't stack up on them too heavily. There are several reasons why, but suffice it to say that they would be a lot better if multiple HoTs from multiple Druids could stack on one target for instance.
---
They're not all like that. Check out Esfand. He's super chill, funny and very knowledgeable about vanilla content.
---
Search Youtube for beginners guide and go from there to watch other videos with specific info of classes, races, gearing up, etc.
---
I am doing that myself and I played Vanilla WoW but I needed a refresher.
---
they recycled the Warcraft 3 dwarf hero ultimate icon. He turns into a giant, he “enrages” if you will.
---
While I understand where you're coming from, I disagree.  Think about it at first when the game comes out, phasing will be a thing.  Now I know a lot of people dont like phasing, but here is a nice thing it adds. People wont be able to follow their streamers as easily, unless they group up.  Not to mention there will be a huge drop off once classic is out for a while.  I'd just grab a server who wont have a streamer, if it's a big concern.
---
From everyone's favourite lore YouTuber, Nobbel. Great way to get refreshed with the lore for Classic!
---
&gt;You'll be able to fill any roll. It might not be the most efficient because 
---
Yea my brother and I discussed the druid making sure to move onto the next target when the current one hits about 10% to allow the priest to get the killing blow.
---
No every progress made during beta will be reset at launch. Beta is running on a special realm that will be deleted.
---
Wow Classic is NOT Wow Vanilla, several things will be different, such as the player base or the UI/Addons system. I expect the game to be barely playable at launch, due to a large amount of players (especially is start zones), not because of lags (hopefully), but because doing your quests and killing mobs will insanely long given the respawn time.
---
Anyway, playing on a private can make you and your guild prepared, but nothing can really recreate what will happen on classic at launch.
---
No it wouldnt work, classes are not homogenized. Some are better at certain things and we like it that way
---
I’m just saying man, that’s knowing every mob location on the grind, my first time to 60 it took me 2 months playing minimum 3 hours a day. Just relax, enjoy the grind. MC is boring after you clear it once it isn’t going anywhere lol
---
You are the one misunderstanding here. First of all i'm not against or for your position. I'm explaining to you why your argument is weak as others are telling you. You are making a claim. The burden of proof is entirely on you. This has nothing to do with philosophy. You've posted clips of the beta, which is good and necessary. Now you need to post proof of the mechanic being absent in vanilla. You need to find clips of this and post them as well. Telling people about your memories of thousands of clips of vanilla is not substantial in any meaningful way.
---
Stuff like this probably https://youtu.be/tUHxX5b0PK0
---
Im guessing you are Horde scum....
---
I think it will be pretty even actually
---
It was, and VODs are here  [https://www.twitch.tv/alenya11](https://www.twitch.tv/alenya11)
---
It kinda bugged me when I first saw the talent trees for TBC. I like how vanilla talents are more about specializing, but TBC made it feel like you're playing a different class with less flexibility.
---
27M 5'4", I sit with my feet in the chair like a child
---
DPS:
---
1 Str= 2 ap, 1 agi = 1 AP, 1 crit = about 12AP, 1hit is 20+ap until 9%.
---
So you want str/agi/ap/crit/hit
---
Tank:
---
You want stam and +defense. Additionally some hit if possible. 
---
There's some guides out there for what dungeon gear you should be looking into getting. I recommend just tanking most dungeons and roll on both. The search word you are looking for is "prebis", you don't have to worry about getting the best option available, just get one of the top 3 if the first ones are too hard to get.
---
Jokes aside thatd probably be super useful for folks with limited mobility trying to play the game
---
All the online polls point to horde outnumbering alliance.
---
Horde will probably will more pug v pug, but alliance will be better in group pvp due to paladins who know how to play their class.
---
I know you said you don’t like the 30/21 spec. But it’s going to make you the most dangerous/viable in pvp and pve until you get a substantial gear investment
---
I've been speedrunning hunter prepping for classic launch for a couple years, so that helps!
---
1. Practise your run
---
2. Have a plan
---
3. No professions (apart from first aid, and cooking to 50)
---
4. No dungeons
---
5. Keep grouping to a minimum
---
No. It is very technical. There is a post on icy-veins that explains it better then I ever could. Check it out.
---
not good enough I want keybinds for each toe
---
Except it isn't because you go oom too fast.  Seal twisting is pretty much never worth it.
---
The mount system is 1.12.0, just not 1.12.1.
---
This means that training is cheap (20g) and mounts are expensive(80g for LVL 40 and 1000g for LVL 60). You have to learn each race's type of training in order to use their mounts and you can only learn a race's type of training (besides your own) when you're Exalted.
---
Riding Cost / Normal Mount Cost / Epic Mount Cost:
---
At Exalted: 16g / 64g / 800g
---
At Revered: 17g / 68g / 850g
---
At Honored: 18g / 72g / 900g
---
At Friendly: 19g / 76g / 950g
---
At Exalted /w R3 PVP: 14g / 56g / 700g
---
At Revered /w R3 PVP: 15g / 60g / 750g
---
At Honored /w R3 PVP: 16g / 64g / 800g
---
At Friendly /w R3 PVP: 17g / 68g / 850g
---
Mounts are also bind-on-use, so if you're Exalted+R3 and your friend is say, Honored, you can save him 200g on his Epic Mount.
---
I have a desktop but it's at apartment and I'm away for the summer so... Meh
---
Man I fucking died at this. LOL
---
Wrong subreddit?
---
For example I have three plans for the start area at launch - the best is to do all the quests if possible, then there is a plan without any quests requiring waiting or static respawns, and a plan to get out of the start area earlier than normal.
---
&gt; when its real power is the judge effect
---
What judge effect?  If you're referring to the 100% slow max speed thing that wasn't added until TBC so in vanilla there is basically zero use for judging SoJ.
---
I’m 25M 5’10 and overweight at 250lbs. I can sit crisscross in my chair. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I've thought about this, but for fortnite
---
Lol I'm 23 now and I actaully did play classic (quite a lot) but I was only 8 when wow came out and barely understood any english so I didn't really experience it in the way I will now.
---
FML my keyboard
---
Seems like people don't understand 1.12. So maybe horde by just sheer numbers
---
But outside AB paladin gives the edge to alliance in the vast majority of scenarios. 
---
Including high end raiding.
---
Shaman is a hybrid in PvP, they pay a tax. Poor support for the good damage
---
If everyone thinks Paladins still have 5 minute blessings from day 1 i can understand those choices....But on the patch it ended 1.12 Alliance is muchhhhh stronger in group Wpvp, WSG, and AV. 
---
Horde are obviously still the best duelists cuz there racials really do matter. But in group combat they do not. For example UD racial is TERRIBLE next to fearward. Just beyond worthless
---
It’s been five hours. Please, tell us what you’ve learned
---
How has no one else pointed out that the stance icons are obviously photoshopped in?
---
This is just a picture of a usb foot pedal....
---
Haha yea we don't plan on raiding :O we are both fathers so we just dont have the time to schedule raiding in. But we both have ambitious plans to try and complete Tier .5 haha. And just pvp if we get any spare time.
---
We don't know yet what the population of each layer is going to be. What I DO know is that exploration routes are a last resort. I have practised launches on pservers several times now with major populations (10k at launch pops) and every time the questing/grind is slower in the start area, but faster than exploration.
---
Classic is in a bit of a grey area at the moment because they don't use dynamic respawn. What they do is by default have faster respawn times in the start areas, but this isn't linked specifically to the number of people in the area. This no longer applies outside the start area, so getting out quickly is going to be critical to get quests done and get ahead of the pack.
---
It's more about aggro management and knowing when min maxing your dmg uptime by knowing the fights than rotations
---
Whats that druid spec about? Sounds interesting
---
Literally any two classes are fine. If your druid does leave you killing blows that would be nice and make it a lot more fun to play priest. Sprit tap + innervate is pretty funny.
---
Never played classic. Started in late TBC but didn’t really start until wotlk. Can’t wait! Taking like two weeks off from work. A little sad I didn’t get into beta but August 27th will be here in no time.
---
Crisscross...applesauce?
---
Or you could play a warlock and shit on them in pvp and still be viable in raids just not the undisputed number one dps spec for a raid
---
So....why does this even matter? If you’re in westfall and you see “LFM VC” or “LFM DM” you’ll know what it means either way.
---
That's really fucking cool, OP
---
The main issue I have with them doing TBC is that the philosophical shift started with it. 
---
25 man raids. Horde paladins, alliance shaman. And most of all, resetting progression.
---
No.. well, three pedal usb input devices are real, but this is photoshopped (very terribly)
---
Yeah this seems to be the general consensus. I think, as of now, my group and I are going to rush level ~6 monsters in elwynn at the start. We just dont have to risk not being able to tag mobs in northshire.
---
It just wasn't worth it mana wise for anything other than SoC and SoB which is why you didn't see it much on anything else.
---
With there being no SoB in vanilla, there's zero point in seal twisting as it'll just make you oom for barely any benefit.  What would you even twist with it in vanilla?  SoR?  Cool so you hit for like 5% more damage at a huge mana cost.  SoJ ? Ok so you have a chance at a stun while still proccing SoC - cool except that stun is shitty and all it really serves is to make your next HoJ be subject to diminishing returns and also cost you a tonne of mana...
---
Im guessing the anxiety is tied to LFG modern wow toxicity
---
Because fuck hubs right
---
Zep to stv and flight to kargath is faster
---
If you arent too busy spamming spacebar u r doin it rong.
---
Bruh, you guys need to start reading blue posts before you come out here talking about stuff that you can’t even back up.
---
The best thing the can do with flying is make it so you can only mount at a flight master.
---
All duos work for leveling. Perhaps some work better for rush leveling, but these two must be really decent, cuz indeed, 2 no-downtime classes.
---
With vanilla warrior regen we have in classic I think warrior is faster than rogues, no question.
---
Okay link me up fam
---
yeah DDR predated WoW by at least 5 years

Awww its so cute to see people on this sub who never played Vanilla. . .
---
Hm but this only states they were finished in regards to sending out invites for the stress test, nothing regarding invites for the beta.
---
&gt; you wont survive the age of internet with that attitude...
---
Not all of us are new to the internet.
---
&gt; go ahead waste your time telling people what to do..... good luck
---
This isn't 08. Reddit isn't b. Civility exists because the communities create it.
---
Undead, Dwarf Priest is better for PVE.
---
“Am I the only one who get the sarcasm” Ironic
---
Way to expose yourself as a guy with no idea wtf he is talking about.
---
31 20 0 spec picks up everything I listed, no ret paladin will pick up imp conc aura or be able to swap auras efficiently as holy is and you cannot have 50 palas in a group, it's 1-2 holy palas because they have almost 0 offensive and you won't be able to bruteforce caps.
---
And no, you are not dead if melee is on you when did you last play premades?
---
Why the fuck else would you jerk ffs
---
ah okay, but afaik there is no 20% vendor discount on exalted.
---
I think its just 10% at revered for all vendors belonging to that faction, so an epic mount cant get cheaper than 800g (rev 10% + r3 10%)
---
Undead. If you roll dwarf, Horde will have many undead who have Will of the Forsaken to break fear. You also get devouring plague, touch of weakness (can proc blackout AFAIK) and you basically get a fear ward every 3min anyway.
---
That reminds me when I started my first character, went to leven in Duskwood and found a goblin in one of the houses. I thought it was an enemy player and panicked. Later figured out that I can't attack it so it should be good.
---
Keep ate it, that’s the classic way
---
Good one
---
So your username is a joke then. I can't imagine you stride very far with those tiny legs
---
There was one I farmed in Swamp of Sorrows for awhile. I know a few other areas I tried as well.
---
&lt;insert Orc emoji&gt;
---
Bad players is great community though - they either quit or they ask people for help :]
---
Now that’s Classic
---
Listen it's alright if you want to play tauren casually but this is an advice if you want to play with us at the top level, orc is superior in every way because resisting a charge means no hamstring, resisting cs or ks means the rog cannot kill you anymore or set up his team.
---
Shamans are almost never in range for a warstomp, and even then it hardly matters because there is peeling (psychic scream, vanish cs, intercept, scatter, fear or a mage nuking).
---
And there is one other thing EVERY player has to get, engineering. Grenades and all. Tauren stomp is obsolete there.
---
For leveling? Honestly anything you can get your hands on, there wont be very many choices. But once you're 60 and raiding it totally depends on what you're doing, some fights require more mitigation some fights require more offtanking DPS etc.
---
We tested this during the stress test and had about 990 players in our guild. Didn't see it tick over 1000 though.
---
Honestly I chuckled at this idea... then I looked at it again, thought about it and decided you can have an upvote. I agree, it would make an awesome shower curtain!
---
Purging the hpal is fine since his seals are not a real problem, and they are usually out of range anyway.
---
If you mean purging ret, yes priests and shamans make retpaladin damage laughably weak to the point where a 0ability warrior is more impactful.
---
No matter how fast i stance dance  
---
 ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶e̶s̶c̶a̶p̶e̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶p̶a̶i̶n̶    Cant catch a frost mage

You're incorrect.
---
That's the Arcade release. The PS1 release wasnt until April the following year in Japan.
---
Welcome back stance dance... Long time no see.
---
It’s not my job to educate idiots on Reddit.
---
Wowhead has a hand tool for tracking blue posts. I suggest you use it.
---
Yeah check out Esfand, who hangs a part of a streamer guild who in-fight among themselves, throw insults at each other, stream snipe, bitch about each other playing different factions and how they're going to camp now ex friends until they quit streaming.
---
May I ask, why cooking?
---
When vanilla was released back then, no one had WoW experience, so I don't understand why so many people are asking things like this
---
&gt; when did you last play pre-mades
---
12 years ago, same as everyone else. Why are you spouting shit as if it’s widely accepted knowledge when the extremely minimal amount of theorycrafting from the time was by people who are under NDA now because they’re design leads?
---
Orc stun resist is good for more than a few fights. The Tauren hp doesn’t scale with total hp.
---
Oops, that’s what I get for just doing a quick Google without digging too deeply. Either way, 99 is before 04

Just a heads up in case you didn't m ow 
---
5 won't be out for months :) either way gl and hf come launch!
---
I've always wanted foot pedals, why woudl u use them to stance dance?
---
Woudln't it make much more sense to use them as modifiers?
---
Maybe some games won't allow it easily, but I'm sure there are work around to any of those issues.
---
I was gona say your points still stand either way heheh

Right that’s where I got that quote, failing to see any blue posts backing up what you’re saying.

Thanks for the heads up!! Are we able to start on dungeon set 1? I was under the impression the upgrade couldn't be achieved until phase 5, but you could get the base set before?

Yup :)
---
8/10 MC: Alliance
---
6/8 BWL: Alliance

8/9 AQ40: Alliance
---
14/15 Naxx: Alliancw

You just listed the only bosses horde got a first kill. Make the list for alliance and my fingers would get sore scrolling down.

awesome, there's a good chance just completing the dungeon set will take a few months for us haha.

This is sick.

There are several cooking quests that give you good xp - one in the nelf start area, then darkshore, then later on in duskwood. Great return for a minute or so to get your cooking up to 50!
---
Ew
---
No he's #1 because he's the funniest and most likable. Sorry your mad bro, no need to hate on the greatest WoW streamer of all time.
---
Oof, I think you're right. The Vanilla Wiki is wrong. Changing my chart now.
---
Just gotta grit your teeth and plough through it hey
---
5% friendly. 10% honored. 15% revered. 20% exalted. Iirc
---
There's a 30 days limit.
---
Ya no I know it’s shopped.  Can they be keybound for that though?
---
1,200ish should have seen 1 by now but unfortunately you can farm 10,000 and never see one.
---
You're overall better off on a hpal on certain bgs. Everything but WSG is good for hpals, in my opinion. There's simply not enough man power to help peel off enemies from him, even with his absurd tankiness. As levels go on, even hpal's viability plummets as priest become, simply, better.
---
Low effort meme dawg
---
MS4 checking in. Its cool if I bring my laptop on my SubI right?
---
The real question should be why add flying?
---
It would only serve the purpose of speed and convenience. Flight paths already do this in a controlled way.
---
Leveling is so slow, it's pretty hard not to learn along the way. But the biggest advice I can give you is to be very careful with how you spend your gold because you want to eventually have a good mount and do not skimp on your gathering professions / bandage skills.
---
I did not avoid your question, I just do not have that answer and I was interested in some possible point of yours about a building.
---
My message was "My personal goal is min-max a fun character that i feel represented."  
---
So it's not about being the best, it's about being something that pleases me in the best way and being a nolife is definitely not in my plans
---
Defias mask from farming bandits in Westfall. No stats but looks badass
---
Yes mam. I recently just went and watched some of your vods of darkshore leveling, keep up the good work testing and your runs. While a lot of the community wants to go slow and at their own pace, there are a lot of us that appreciate testers like you trying to find the fastest and most efficient routes.
---
How well you do on the middle laps of a race doesn't matter if you don't cross the finish line first. In 5 Raid Instances, Alliance had the World First clear in 1 of them.
---
stoneform is amazing for rogues, it's super helpful for breaking out of other rogues' blinds, and vanishing after getting jumped by a hunter or warrior, the two hardest classes for a rogue to handle. Or just giving the finger to UD spriests.
---
Hi, /u/vymipie
---
Why is this here
---
It's a fun one though cmon :D
---
Are we honestly talking about the clickers who did that? lol. Why do you think that matters? Even if we assumed that they were playing near level. That could just mean the elite horde guild had more skill. Not it was easier for them than the alliance. 
---
During those early patches reckoning paladins could literally one shot bosses. 
---
And again that's not 1.12 nor is it in the meta. Why you think that will matter I have no idea. We will never see the 1.1 talents
---
The cap is threat in a good guild with 40 dudes playing at the ceiling. Trust me alliance is better.
---
Horde have some buff i forget the name of blessing of the warchief or something. That's it
---
As soon as Paladins got the 15 minute blessing and kings moved to the low in the prot tree they became the best support in the game by miles.
---
And that's the real asymmetry, paladin vs shaman. Paladin some Paladin are raid wide. None of the SHaman ones are
---
DO YOU SERIUOSLY NOT GET THIS? lol
---
I just said I can understand if you think Paladins only get 5 min blessings and we're replaying the whole expansion with progressive talents. We're not.
---
Here is a Grand Marshall who did everything there was to do in the game...As a clicker

But.. what does it have to do with classic WoW? Some of these weps were in Vanilla, but also other eras. It's cool, but comon.. rule #1 of the subreddit?
---
That is baller as fuck. Damn.
---
Mizkif, erob, ice poseidon, trainwrecks etc are all good wtf :D
---
I farmed all 4 of them and that was the one that took me the longest.. Weeks of farming when not raiding in BC.. The Oozling took forever as well.. Its a random chance and could potentially never drop.
---
inb4 deleted for rule 1, lol
---
What about the rest of them?
---
Np, just happy some ppl get enjoyment out of my videos!
---
It will depend on your group makeup and where the priority for those debuff slots falls.  Most groups will still be built around having the "Must Have" debuffs provided in some form.  As a warlock, you really only have 4 debuffs that you could put up.
---
Your curse, Corruption, Immolate, and Siphon Life if you are deep affliction.
---
In most settings, you will already have a curse assignment that you will need to fulfill.  This becomes even more important in a smaller group setting, so you won't be using a DPS curse unless you have an overabundance of warlocks in your group.
---
Corruption is one that is good if you are a SM warlock, as it can get your Nightfall to proc.  So, if you are the SM lock in your group, you will likely get one here, but if you are the DS spec, then your priority drops, so it will depend on your group makeup.
---
Immolate doesn't synergize with the main raid specs.  This is because it is fire damage, thus doesn't benefit from your talent/gear setup that maximizes shadow damage.  It also doesn't gain full benefit from crit since the DoTs don't crit in vanilla.  
---
Siphon Life is pretty weak as far as dots go, so you won't even get priority to use this over other warlock's corruption.
---
So, the answer is maybe you can put more DoTs up in the smaller raids, but probably not.
---
Running into a small building with a melee, a pally at that, was the worst of them all.  He is probably in melee range even while hugging the wall as far as possible from him.  He should have ran behind the building and waited for him to come out.

The 5 to 15 minute Blesssing buff had no effect on combat. No fight lasts that long. It was just a quality-of-life addition for Paladins.
---
I understand where you are coming from, but I just don't have faith that the people whose characters that they are attached to will be okay with having their character not be relevant. We'll be getting to the point where they just won't do Naxx because the reset will come, and why bother? 
---
I'm not saying your points are not valid, I'm just saying that they would have a better time being able to keep their attachments to their characters, characters that they payed money to play.
---
I feel like their perspective is the closest to the average player than not.
---
Some elite pets have skills or rankings others of the same level don’t have. I remember taming the quest boar in lakeshire for an increase rank to charge iirc
---
You could heal them as a 0/0/0 shaman if you wanted.
