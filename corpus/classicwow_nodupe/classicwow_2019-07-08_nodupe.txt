Not sure what you are smoking but OP clearly asks for gold farmimg tips for retail so he can get tokens for gametime.
---

---
To you OP: Easiest way to farm gold without having tons of alts is just getting a herbalist/miner and getting the new herbs and ores from 8.2 If you have more alts with maxed out professions you can you them to craft the new items that got added in the patch like mount equipment.
---
---
---
Exactly. Too bad its snowflake era.
---
the honor system is \*vaguely confirmed\* to take a couple months, this is around when most players will be hitting 60. - it's possible that Ony and Rag will be much more casual friendly due to the 16 debuff limit and better understanding of available consumables and world buffs (though only a small portion of them will be available)
---
You can get spell pen on gear.   Lot's of guilds won't have a spriest, so shadowweaving isn't a certain.   Imp scorch and winter's chill is certainly buffs you don't get though.  
---
Even still the math for lightning bolt has to be close or better.  I don't remember the spell coefficients for cast speed off the top of my head though.
---
I've been looking into ele shaman as well.  The main complaint I hear is that there isn't great ele gear for them and they're bursty / run out of mana.  I think the main reason for this is that their item sets aren't itemized that well for Elemental spec.  If you look at their tier sets, 1 and 3 are itemized mainly toward +healing.  Their tier 2 has some +damage but still favors healing pretty heavily.  Their tier bonuses are also aimed more toward healing.  If you want to gear for +damage and have enough mana to sustain yourself throughout an entire fight then you will have to pick up quite a few cloth (and some leather) pieces.  That being said, I think it can be viable, you just have to itemize correctly for your role rather than following the tiers in most cases.  Best of luck :)
---
If you also level first aid you wont have enough cloth from normal leveling, you would have to grind on humanoids for some additional.
---
Dynamic spawns were used in retail vanilla. It worked fine then and it works fine now on pservers
---
If you read the rest of my posts, you will see that I propose a 1-2 month delay before decay on DKP, or instead a Cap on DKP, so hording it doesnt work, because you quickly end up with people either bidding lower amounts, or rolling off at the CAP amount.    
---
The latter would also have the benefit of preventing Fury Warriors (who dont have full armour sets in each tier) from sniping all the weapons / accessories away from the other physical DPS.
---
Would be trivial to write the code for this given I had information about the account. If account A has at least one horde character that’s played at x frequency, increase count.
---
Agree it doesn't really matter, my point of commenting was to support 2/3 in imp renew as viable :P
---
I'm not strawmanning. If you want it before 1.12, it was 1 hour queues. After, it was near instant cross realm. No in between. I can guarantee you, nobody wants some new system for BGs when it's supposed to be "authentic".
---
Whenever you get a usable item you should probably do a quick google to see if it becomes really useful later on. The barov trinket for instance is really useful to absorb Huhuran's enrage. Most people didn't know this so they sold or DE'd it.
---
Would help if anyone actually knew how to play paladins at all.
---
Mana.
---
brings totem!!!
---
I'm looking forward to playing feral Druid for a million reasons
---
Innervate for healers
---
Tranq as an "Oh shit" button
---
Battlerez for when people die
---
Stealth AND track humanoids for PVP
---
Amazing self/off healing
---
Can tank and DPS with the same talent tree
---
Imp MOTW is one of the best buffs in game
---
Awesome 5 man tanks with swipe spam and high health
---
Powershifting for cat DPS is fun
---
People give me shit all the time for wanting to be a feral Druid, but we'll see who's laughing when you spend over an hour looking for a tank and I swoop in to help ya :P
---
So yeah, not worth worrying about the honor system until phase 2
---
god i fucking hate gnomes
---
Best post ever on this sub hands down
---
damn filler race
---
You could pretty much be my clone... except I’m only a wee little lad at 35.
---
This is because your comparing a good player with a bad player. Regardless of class. Good player is going to make it look good. If all members of the raid are good players boomkins have no use.
---
It sort of depends what you mean. If we're talking about like pvp flash healing, no, they really don't. It's not enough healing. They have regrowth. But if we're talking about a 1.5 second cast that heals for a decent amount, yes, they do. 
---
But just to compare rank 2 healing touch with rank 1 flash of light. 
---
Rank 2 Healing Touch (with talents): 1.5 second cast, 45 mana, heals for 96-124
---
Rank 1 Flash of Light (with talents): 1.5 second cast, 35 mana, heals for 70-81
---
Healing touch is a 2.0 second cast base at rank 2, meaning it would benefit slightly more from +healing gear than a 1.5 second cast. But it is penalized for being a level 8 spell. But note that its base healing is higher than Flash of Light's base heal. But Flash of Light is not really a "quick and dirty" fast heal. It heals for very little. Even at max rank, it only heals for 343-384. It's just incredibly mana efficient. Low rank Healing Touch is more comparable to it. 
---
Things like Lesser Healing Wave and Flash Heal are more like "quick and dirty" heals. Rank 1 Flash Heal costs 125 mana and heals for 193-238. Similarly, rank 1 Lesser Healing Wave costs 105 mana and heals for 162-187. 
---
Put simply, not all "flash" heals are the same sort of thing. Do druids have anything like Flash Heal from a Priest or Lesser Healing Wave from a Shaman? No. The closest they have is Regrowth. Do they have something similar to Flash of Light? Yes.
---
See I like this. Constructive post with direct response to OP.
---
A perfectly played mage is god tier.
---
Confusing technology bad
---
&gt; everyone loved them, the activity surrounding BGs was so high, BGs were the shit 
---
apparently not, they had to implement xrealm because you had 4-5hours queue at night...
---
The only real issue anyone has with layering is the potential for abuse. The only players that would gain and advantage from said abuse are the keyboard warriors and neckbeard no lifers that constantly contribute to the circle jerk on this forum.
---
Said players are worried that they won’t be able to sperg out as much as the next guy and hate the idea of someone gaining an advantage in farming and becoming rich. Additionally they will have to no-life it even harder to get to the point to abuse layering and that is not what classic is really about.
---
So this circular logic which ONLY affects a small percentage of players is why this entire subreddit hates layering. Just because a player/guild could potentially never have to farm after phase 1 isn’t reason enough to abandon layering as a solution to the tourists which will represent a REAL problem.
---
Bring on the downvotes neckbeards.
---
Yeah I’m stuck between warrior / rogue for my main right now. Any things to consider for either class? I’m torn. I like having the ability to tank and use essentially every weapon in the game (1h 2h) and wear plate armor as a warrior but I like the rogues stealth ability and PvP prowess. What do you think?
---
&gt; Lot's of guilds won't have a spriest, so shadowweaving isn't a certain
---
Many guilds will spec a healing priest into weaving rather than take an extra SP, but the viability of it also depends on how many warlocks you have in the raid group too.
---
cost 30c to mail shit.  That adds up quick early on.
---
1-2 month delay is essentially what I was saying with phase based decay. That is also a method that works, though I'm partial towards the weekly decay + phase decay because it prevents people hoarding then dropping bidding bombs and scooting right before a new phase launches.
---
Which ever gives you the most AP / time to kill.
---
For either faction the [Outlaw Sabre](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16886) from the Blackfathom Deeps will give you the most use, as its also a quest reward anyone can get from a single run.
---
right, we need a Classic General PvE and a Classic General PvP
---
Re-read my post; he’s not saying 1 hr queues are desirable. He’s saying there are other solutions to the problem.
---
Your priest would have to heal you for that combo to be good.
---
Why keep asking it then?  smh
---
&gt; They damage the cohesion and identity of the server.
---
I don't accept this premise. Your strongest sense of community in WoW is your friends, followed by your guild, followed by your faction, with the enemy faction being dead last.
---
Dunbar's number, which gets proven over and over again, says you can only have 150 meaningful relationships. So even in a large enough guild, you're not going to contain them all.
---
I can name a few guilds from the opposite faction from my Vanilla days, but I can't name a single player. Certainly not any I ever had meaningful interactions with in a battleground.
---
The benefit of only having players in battlegrounds from your realm is just tiny, if it exists at all. While the benefit of having every available player in your region that is queued for a battleground able to make the games happen sooner while also preventing win-trading, is a huge benefit.
---
HS is a waste of rage mostly, I know all about hs kite etc but the point is most other classes are so much smoother then warrior, hell only rogues even come close and they got a ton of cc
---
i have a similar setup to this too, except one of my monitors is a tv,so we have the benefit of both worlds with PC gamin together and then occationally settin a movie on the tv and watchin it from the couch
---
I go to school 3 days a week for about 4 hour lessons and I work about 10 hours a week from home. I usually go out on Mondays with my drinking pals at University.
---
I think you got them when you bought battle chests back in the day. I have the TBC one and another Vanilla one, and I certainly didn’t buy the magazines themselves.
---
All the more reason to make sure they are HIT capped.    
---
It really is a problem it MC/Ony as there are no drops for Fury warriors (1 pair of gloves, a belt, 2 rings, 1 ranged weapon, and 3-4 weapons) when compared to other classes with 8 armour pieces, trinkets, accessories and weapons.
---
The server might handle 15k peaks, but are the players? The gameplay? The world?
---
WoW was not *designed* to handle 15,000 players at a time. You do that, you need to figure out a way that everyone can coexist in a way that remains true to the experience they are trying to recreate. If you insist on cramming everyone into one single instance of the world, you need to compensate for that in some other way - like dynamic respawns.
---
It's that, or you end up with way, way too many people fighting over just about any resource.
---
ohh yah, the tier sets aside from t 2.5 won't be useful.  You would have to mostly use crafted and non set items.  Mostly cloth.
---
There are a lot of "if" statements in a comment that isn't about programming. I don't know if you are caught up, but layering will exist, and ends at the latest of the start of phase 2. I can't imagine phase 1 only lasting 1-2 weeks, and layering will probably mirror it.
---
You seem like you are just setting yourself up to be angry. If you hate layering so much, then don't play? I mean, that's literally the argument people use against me because I am for layering. I want to play. 
---
Layering will be going live with launch, so I really hope you dont *surprise pikachu* when that happens, because you did know ahead of time.
---
No, he doesnt bring anything better than a resto shaman though. Every other meme spec has some kind of advantage: enhance has improved wf/totem, feral/boomkin has crit aura, spriest has shadow debuff and group healing and rets have something too. Ele shamans are literally worthless in pve.
---
Yeah I get that, but I may have not explained my response well - to be true vanilla, it's either 1 hour queues, or cross realm. You'd have to change it and make a new system otherwise. That would mean changes, which a LOT of people are against, and there are certainly so, so, so, so many things that are higher on my priority list to change than Xrealm BGs.
---
The people who corpse camp aren't doing it for the honor. This change wouldn't do anything, unfortunately.
---
Considering it's happened ever since vanilla, and the most successful guilds did it, I'm not too worried about relying on luck.
---
that one zone isnt really making that much of a difference :3  
---
if u really want a mount from a different race you should definitely preplan your leveling so youre making all those important reputation quests at their respective level, because they give nearly nothing once you outleveled them.  
---
After doing every quest you would still need about 50-150 runecloth stacks to raise reputation to exalted aswell.
---
Are they even bone? I figured they were just wood carved to look like tusks.
---
Why should reddit know what you wanna play?
---
&gt; The server might handle 15k peaks, but are the players? The gameplay? The world?
---
Yes, private servers do just fine with no layering. Dynamic respawns were in vanilla
---
Make them go Horde.
---
nightsaber riding is 20g.  
---
the epic mount itself costs 800g.
---
Except everyone now says the bosses die super quick.  If they die quick, it's impossible for casters to run oom.   Btn mana tubers, dark runes, and mana pots, I don't see why you can't sustain for several minutes.  You could even downrank lightning bolt, if you had to.
---
I'm on a 75%, that's probably the smallest I'd go, I love my arrow keys and function buttons too much (also I use them all the time).
---
u missed a huge opportunity right after 8.2... lots of profession stuff u could make to sell for huge profit.
---
the inscription trinkets on my server cost like 5k to make and sold for 80k.  i noticed late and still made over a million when they were down to like 30k.
---
its all back to being dead now.
---
Heard that site was actually ass though?
---
Yes I wouldn't mind that either, but long term it just wasn't popular. There was a reason it was a ghost town and as soon as they changed it, it was very popular.
---
Gnome warrior. If life were perfect, classic at launch would be nothing but gnome warriors
---
Yup, I have the same take on it. If I have to choose unplayable lag launch vs. layering for weeks or months, I'll pick unplayable launch every time
---
You can never have too many shaman.  There will be like 4 melee groups, one for the mt group, and two more for the healer/caster groups for Mana tide totem.  That's 7 shaman.
---
Because Ele shamans don't stack spirit as a stat, and innervate only affects spirit-based mana regen.  Ele shamans don't stack spirit because they have no talents available to make spirit-based regen available in combat like other casters do.
---
&gt; You are basically admitting that people are logging off and then it becomes playable
---
No they get out of the starting zone and spread out... A week ago a new private server launched and it didn't take me longer than an hour to get out of the 1-5 area. It works fine.
---
If you cared about the community you wouldn't be for a feature that has shredded the community at every chance it has. Also I'm not downvoting you, others just know how wrong you are.
---
OP's solution is fucking nightmare that I would rather not have any battlegrounds at all than subject myself to.
---
"Sorry, there's too many Horde online right now, we either need more Alliance to login or more Horde to logoff before you can play!"
---
AND
---
"Sorry, there's too many Horde characters on that realm right now, we know you want to play with your friends, but they've all used up their invites, so too bad!"
---
Blizzard would never do that to preserve some tiny "community cohesion" that, based on pretty much every thread that brings this up, most players don't care about or disagree with completely.
---
Unsure how else other to put it than "you're wrong". Dynamic spawns only help so much. In the case of named mobs, only 1 can be up at a time. When you have 50 people waiting to kill it, it becomes extremely frustrating. Its like this on all named mobs through lvl 20. Some of these quests have pretty decent gear as rewards. Having to skip these quests puts some classes at a significant disadvantage. Even unnamed mobs can be bottle necked.
---
I was a day 1 player back in 2004 and it was a shit show.
---
Layering is temporary and (imo) necessary.
---
Thicc
---
that feeling when u realize that were the casual boys and you "bfa generation" is a younger generation without that many responsibilities and more time...
---
No no no, Alliance seems like a much better fit for OP.
---
Not really... I said I was deciding between 2 alliance characters and the object statement of you comment was play horde. 
---
Honestly, I'd like to play horde in classic but I'd also like to play with guildies and rl friends who are all staunch ally supporters.
---
There's weak and weak. The original balance 31 point talent was hurricane. The spell effect had a tendency to disconnect about 1/3 of our raid team. Who needs to be powerful in game when you can hit people so hard you knock them offline.
---
Blizzard is going to use the version of AV they have. They're not going to spend resources recreating an old version from memory.
---
And frankly, I prefer it, so calling it "wrong" is very subjective.
---
They're not talking about a forum where you can talk about Classic. They mean the realm forums where the communities on the server trash talked/recruited etc, like Blackrock or Tichondrius Realm Forums. Obviously they're not out yet because Blizzard hasn't announced the specific servers for Classic yet. It seems likely they will exist but we probably won't know until they appear.
---
&gt;  In the case of named mobs, only 1 can be up at a time
---
Wouldn't want people to group to share tags or anything. People level just fine on private servers with 10k pops, no layering and no queues. If they can do it then it's laughable Blizzard can't
---
It doesn't matter if it gets patched out or not (although I agree it probably will). It was only a minor benefit when it worked 100% every, it's completely unusable for levelling when it only works &lt;50% of the time like it does now.
---
This just in /u/SpuriousNinja learns what a joke is. More at 11
---
Don't forget portals!
---
There are so many people that have wayyyy to much emotionally invested in this game.
---
Hopefully most of them level fast, raid fast, and burn out because it’s sickeningly toxic.
---
Night Elf Druid or bust. Stay away from those commie horde bastards.
---
I just wish hunter scaled better. I was playing one on a private TBC server as BM and it was amazing. I just wanna play a NE female but really want to play mage too. It's probably mage or dagger spec NE rogue so I can let the human rogues and warriors fight over swords.
---
You're correct on that. I'm in a big regional firm, busy seasons are around 60 hour work weeks from Late Janauary to April 15th. Idk how long the fall busy season is because I haven't been at the firm for one yet.
---
They're using the version that allows you to win or lose av.
---
Nothing you said has the cadence or delivery of a joke, possibly because it's reeeeally hard to convey sarcasm in by text only
---
Fewer and much weaker NPCs. Making taking control points easier.
---
Ahh, you think this is only limited to the 1-5 start. The stress test was much different. The entire starting zones (all of Elwynn for humans) had people spawn camping. People were grouping to kill orange/red mobs (and generally failing) because it was so unplayable. That was even with layering, although the layer included more people than it likely will on launch. People were competing heavily for tags all the way up to level the level 15 cap.
---
I keep saying it: people arguing against layering are really unaware of the scope of the issue. There is no comparison to private servers. This launch will be unlike any private server launch. If you disagree with that, I really have no idea what to tell you.
---
If you need a /s to understand sarcasm I question your IQ. There's plenty to go on you're just being a dry apomge
---
It’s called having fun man. There are pieces for any spec in any raid. Maybe it’s not optimal but it’s not going to hold any competent group back in and of itself.
---
Classic TBC please!! 
---
(After 2 years of vanilla of course).
---
That doesn't change the position of their hands on the keyboard. They're either next to or on top of the numpad.
---
There's a dagger in Mauradon that I want to try too.  Looks interesting.  Does 100 shadow dmg, and gives the caster 100 mana.  Supposedly like 10% proc chance.
---
actually Horde wasn't overwhelmingly besting Alliance during vanilla for progression, quite the other way around
---
cthun and kt were the only kills the Horde got, and that's arguably due to the nerfs happening at a favourable time for Nihilum
---
I don’t give a fuck what you think cus 95% of this sub is rtarded

Hey all! This question is literally un-Google-able as far as I can tell, so I turn to this sub in hopes of learning more.
---
I'm curious, which talents in vanilla are "one-per-raid" talents in the vein of the Frost damage debuff Mages can take? At first, I thought that was the only one, but I saw someone mention that Improved Mark of the Wild can be considered to be one as well, and now I'm curious what else is out there.

Also you can always make food/water so you never need to make a costly trip to town because you're running low.

https://youtu.be/Mh_cLN66zHA go to ~1:50 in and watch leeway in action with that gouge if you doubt it was in vanilla.
---
Its effect will be there, but overall pretty small. To say it'll make any class non-viable is incredibly hyperbolic.
---
That's because it wasn't implemented until 1.10
---
There's job postings on indeed all the time for fish processors aboard boats in alaska. Start there and work your way up and you will make lots of money. We always need good guys. We have a very high turnover rate and most guys quit after the first trip. So be prepared to work like you never have before, this is brutal stuff. Be warned if you quit they will cut your contracts pay in half and you will have to buy your own way home, aka you will probably end up owing the company money if you quit first trip.
---
Right in the feels man...
---
You'll make friends in the game :)
---
It was implemented towards the end of Vanilla - 1.10
---
There's a reason many folks don't remember it.
---
That's the reason.
---
I am not an old school wow RPer, so I can't speak from experience. My advice comes from a mix of a *lot* of experience running D&amp;D for new players, and from some MMO rp post retail-vanilla.
---
My guess is that you're correct in that there is likely to be a slight alliance favour. However, one of the nice things is that RP servers are more limited in terms of server selection, so players wont realm hop to avoid faction imbalance, meaning that slight faction imbalances don't snowball. I expect RP-PvP in particular to be more faction neutral than other RP servers, since there is a larger variety in types of players that want RP-PvP than RP-PvE (imo).
---
Hooray for sharding or crossrealm zones or whatever they want to call it now. Totally good for gameplay experiences right???
---
&gt; You're clearly upset since typing and punctuation has gone out the window
---
Oh no! I hit the wrong key while on my tablet. Your reasoning is grounded for being on a sandy foundation. Private servers have been beta testing server loads for years and to ignore them is to put your head in the sand. If you don't think it compares you're a fool
---
i believe thats wrong ? you dont need the latest expansion. just an active sub.
---
This statement doesn’t change the fact that your original advice was to pick up a “15 year old PC” a statement like that is misinformed, and quite frankly ridiculous.
---
Seriously? Mage is my favorite dps in pvp. The lack of tanking/healing concerns me though. How hard is it to get groups and gear up?
---
If you plan on powershifting with cat you need to innervate yourself.
---
Well the fights wont go faster than they did in vanilla, at least for the vast majority of guilds.
---
But you had to do all those things as resto, where you could downrank heals and cast more infrequently.  Ele doesn't have either of those benefits.
---
Is there a list of fastest / slowest to gear up based on raid comps?
---
I see you painted windows on the basement walls. Say “hi” to Mom for me.
---
Yeah. There’s no way you’re gonna find a guild. Sorry bud, sucks to suck
---
If you start groups it's easy and even if you don't every group wants a mage even if it's just for being a mobile vending machine
---
The sagefish recipes werent in the game at release, not sure if they will be included in phase one in classic or if blizzard will release them in phase 2 or 3.
---
Do wet sponges have personality? Also, bolding a sentences doesn't make it a joke, often the opposite, it's to emphasise the main point. And, let's face it this has gone on waaaay to long for a Reddit argument with someone you think has sub-par intelligence, so let's just leave it here shall we.
---
On PvE, if you want world PvP then get your guild together and go raid a town.
---
You can downrank as a caster.   It's just not really a dps gain on mages, and certainly not locks.
---
Thank you :)
---
And it doesn’t change the fact that he is asking for a PC that can run wow...seriously he can go to Walmart and pick one up. Stupid question gets stupid answer.

Shadow weaving, divine spirit, improved scorch I think?

Yea, but they can at least collect the pieces. I'd love to have the tank pieces for OT / Dungeons / PvP.
---
Someone not knowing what PC to buy is a “stupid question” I get it, you’re an elitist, don’t shit on someone for asking a question just become you weren’t raised with manners.

Is it really any worse to skin the humanoids after mass murdering them for the clothes on their backs (cloth) and the coin in their pockets (gold) than it is to just leave them to rot and move on? I mean either way the damage is already done, right?
---
By late AQ and Naxx TPS is more important than the health racial on Tauren.
---
Yeah I don't understand. You don't need to take a week off work for the day of release. Login after work, make yer dude, fool around, and go to bed. Wait a day or two and the tryhardelitists racing to 60 in 3 or 4 days will be gone, and it will be fine. 
---
Like always. The sharding nonsense is BS. When I went back to try out bfa after being MIA since cata was out, it's a fucking ghost town dude. There's nobody. Anywhere. And if there is? All I found was people not interested in socializing or grouping for any reason. 
---
I just loved queuing for dungeons with silent parties, mindlessly speed pulling every dungeon. It was the most fun I've ever had! /s
---
Gnome life! The superior race!
---
Most likely, I'll try to play too many alts and never get anything done :P But it's fun!
---
This is a big reason I want to go Druid as well. No one plays them so all tier gear will be pretty easy to get, I won't have to compete with 12 other rogues in the raid...
---
&gt; but from then on it went straight downhill.
---
Are you throwing shade over Wrath of the Lich King, aka the best expansion this game has ever seen ?
---
Work 7-4, play 4-midnight. Easy. Also ditch the female you wont be needing her anymore.
---
It wasn't even reliable in Classic... As a hunter in PvE you actually FD on cooldown to try and drink because it fails so reliably.

I kind of want to play a dwarf hunter, but I also kinda want to play a shaman.   What do I do?    If I make a shaman and a dwarf, then there's the whole cross faction thing going on where it becomes harder to send stuff from one character to the other.
---
Human Warlock will be the first and the main character of mine. After 60 lvl... we'll see. Maybe a paladin, and a mage. But human warlock will be my main.

At this point I don't care, you already won.  
---
A small portion of the game, for a small portion of people.  
---
Yet, you want it all. Who's selfish ?
---
fuck, these things are going to come together with existing bugs and layering on launch, and Classic is going to feel sooo fucking weird.
---
The pserver crowd loves engineering, and hates alchemy. It would make sense to set a cooldowns and cost limit that applies to all items, but the view that engineering is the only option for pvp is unquestionable, and anything that makes it worse cannot be considered. Potions are more expensive because 90% in the beta has mining and not herbalism.
---
Posts like these will be showing up until launch, even once the beta is over in 5 days. Eventually we'll get people thinking the game launched early.
---
Cut the rogue, they are assholes

get a gf that will help you get Thunderfury

See I feel opposite. Alliance is cookie cutter easy fantasy layout. Same ol races and lore.
---
My only issue with the site (I’ll be using it anyway, so thank you) is that I have trouble seeing the difference in colours on the objective list. 
---
It would be helpful if the difference between “hand in” and “do objective” we’re not just green vs red, but had icons or a textured fill rather than the solid colours, just so it is easier to differentiate at a glance. 
---
Super minor gripe, otherwise thanks for an awesome tool and I look forward to using it. 
---
(Specifically shout out to that Wetlands skip around level 9 in Dun Morogh, that is amazing)
---
Are you okay? You are literally ignoring this entire thread.
---
I get that you are upset, but its acceptable in society to say "I'm wrong". The "putting fingers in your ears" is projecting really hard, which is clear to anyone who bothers to take the time to read this (I hope not).
---
What makes ret paladins so bad? I only ever played during burning crusade and I was 13, now 24 and haven’t played in 9 years. I rolled ret pally the whole time and loved it, but in prep for classic to drop I’ve seen how much hate they get. Was I just a dumb kid who didn’t realize how awful I was? Or can you make

Taming the Druid? Some crazy, but very interesting!
---
&gt; With the world buff exploit
---
You keep saying using that word...
---
I think it’ll be Paladin. People know by now that they’re awful to level and one dimensional at 60. And of course, only on the alliance.
---
My American brain is converting all your numbers. You’re apparently 10 ft tall, you weigh, 300lbs (as any 10ft person should), and you spent $550 on your chair.
---
Exactly same problem for me. I’m so fucking torn
---
No. You don't have beta
---
[yes](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClumsyVenomousTireNotLikeThis), but really, probably yea as they've always been that way
---
Yo, dude. Thats literally the point. You are pulling this out of your ass, there is no proof either way. I can't prove a negative. Are you for real? LOL
---
Tier 3?  Yeah it's tokens, like what you had in BC.  Druids compete with Paladins, Shamans, and Hunters, so no steep competition for the pieces.
---
Blizzard actually did fire 800 people and rehire for the same positions though...
---
At least the solutions people come up with are pretty funny, usually give me a good laugh.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The best solution IMO is the idea of having multiple self contained version of each server (IE Blackrock 1,2 and 3) then roll them together at a later date if required.
---
I can't really see any downside to this, it's a win win
---
Mine just comes down to community really. I'm going Priest, either Dwarf or Troll, I just need to find a good bunch of people to play with. Thats what will keep me logging in.
---
It really does not affect the economy in a way anyone will be able to notice. Farmers can't make enough to put a dent in the entire server economy. Especially before phase 3.
---
Classic certainly isn't free.  If they're releasing the game to make money, and they're obviously spending money on the project, we know they're willing to spent *something*.  You're speculating that because Blizzard has cut costs in the past, that's why they're making this decision.  I don't think that's a sound inference.  Why do anything like layering to begin with?  Why design and deploy a new technology?  Why not just add queues and call it quits?  They already have that technology and it's very inexpensive.  Queues seem like the best cost-cutting measure.
---
Again though, it's speculation at best to guess at Blizzard's motives based on circumstantial evidence.
---
Go ahead and compare that personnel cost to a few servers, assuming they even had to buy new. Most of the infrastructure was likely already an asset tbh. 
---
Y I K E S dude
---
Going from cool bad to actually a terrible player bad.
---
What event?
---
troll shadow priest (willing to go holy for raiding), orc warlock, druid, and maaaybe UD mage.  
---
What should I go if I want to experience all the raiding I missed out on in vanilla but ultimately still want to pvp the most enjoyable class?  
---
 
---
I absolutely adore the mages utility but I can’t really get down with the idea of spamming frostbolt for raids. I adore the other 3 choices based on varying levels of spell rotation, survivability, and damage they output.
---
Somewhat related, as it’s something I’d *like* to purchase, I just don’t know what it is....
---
When I play games for more than a few hours, I get terrible neck pain. It’s progressive, so it gets more severe as more time passes. My monitors are eye level, I just think I might hunch over a bit in my chair. 
---
Does anyone here use anything to help correct their posture while gaming? I’d like to play 15-20 hours at launch, but I know it will be painful as hell if I don’t figure out this neck pain thing. I
---
Nice tits.
---
Must say, this seems easy to follow and I don't feel like I need to read a lot while using it. Will definitely be running this on the 2nd screen or the elite x2 while leveling.
---
Talent trees.  I've missed them soooo much.
---
I honestly haven't decided on a faction yet let alone race and class.
---
AQ20 was a completely different raid.
---
Wrath was good, no doubt. Had some amazing raids, but TBC was better (imo). Remember, WotLK introduced the dungeon finder which pretty much killed social interactions.
---
They'd still make money without layering, that's not really a good argument. How can you explain their original stance on dedicated language servers for EU and say it's not for cutting costs?
---
Layering isn't a new tech it's sharding rebranded that's more prone for abuse.
---
Seriously all people have done is bitch about layering on reddit, it's been upvoted to the top many times, yet people still circlejerking that you can't bash layering in this sub...
---
I;ve always liked the classic druid sets on Taurens.
---
is that Cruel Barb on your lock? If so, i bet someone got real pissed at you haha
---
Did you just admit to brigading me since scores are still hidden? Down/up voting isn't agree/disagree btw - but since you are concerned, my last 10 posts are between 2 and 5 points (as if that matters?). 
---
Who TF talks about up/downvotes lmao
---
They changed it with BFA? I was just going based on my roommate's experience in legion.
---
I've known almost since Classic was announced that I want to be the best possible Alliance tank, so it's Human Warrior for me, man. I almost feel like I'm missing out by not getting to participate in these "what should I play???" threads.
---
Ko8kh90hi999o980999u87oii9o87ik9o99k
---
It’s also harder for some classes like warlock cause of undead fear immunity/the fact they don’t run away on low health. I love starting in tirisfal.
---
If they'll cut employees they'll cut costs for servers too. Don't be a fool, Blizzard only cares about the bottom line like every other corporation
---
I've always been a fan of a fair loot counsel.  You abuse it, you lose good raiders.  You implement it well, you retain good raiders.
---
Nah, all polls show Paladins are going to be one of the most played Alliance classes. Same with Shaman on the Horde.
---
Pallies are absolutely amazing healers and are incredibly good in PvP.
---
I have been stuck on nelf druid for a good while now. So far I havent changed my mind in about a month. Before that it was paladin, before that hunter, before that rogue and before that warrior. Never be able to make me change my Alliance colors though! ;)
---
Over time people are more and more concerned about being the best in the role they choose. Druids in Classic are extremely versatile, but do not excel at anything, which makes them a poor choice for raiding where roles are very well defined. So yes, druid will be the least played class overall (ignoring sham/pally since only one faction has each of them). They are still very fun, and people who master their druids will find themselves able to play at the highest levels of the game, but overall they are less desirable.

Profit that shits on your brand is not worth it. You can make money without making ALL the money, no consumer likes a shitty experience so the company can make money.
---
Those are great links. I wasn't aware of them. Thank you!
---
blizzard didn't, but it's a fair argument to use against players
---
I'd argue Rank 3 would be the highest value proposition. Which would put one in a similar state as a Rank 4 Flash of Light + hots. Paladin don't have hots, so it would make sense that they would have a bit more in the actual flash heal.
---
there are many places of this kind, each duel could happen anywhere else, if there's a troll in one place, both players hearth and duel somewhere close before someone else can come, easy as that. Setting a convenient hearth is a foolproof way to have a safe duel.
---
Wtf is power shifting?  I’m torn between orc shaman and Tauren Druid and reading what that dude said made me want to be a Druid (that and +hp, war stomp and herb skill). 
---
But for real, how can you beat totem twisting, chain lightning and chain heal?
---
You know what though, I’m kind of scared vanilla won’t be as hyped after a month. All of us 30+ year olds wanna play, but are we really going to find the time? I say right now I wanna raid, but how many 3+ hour nights can I really do a week?
---
So shaman or Druid?
---
Even though I've always liked vanilla the most, what I'm most excited for is a clean slate.
---
Expansions are not fresh starts, but classic IS. I'm excited for the vast majority of people to be poor again
---
me horde good racial me skilled
---
I mean let's be honest though.  Your comment wasn't funny.  Haha be horde haha don't be a gnome!
---
Like... Maybe the basest form of humor but not surprising someone doesn't see it as funny because it wasn't for anyone who has ever heard a joke before.
---
I guess it is a reference to Harry Potter...
---
I really doubt that will be an issue. The vendor price of the mats for a linen bag are 1.2 silver. A silk pack is 25 silver in vendor price of mats.The reason no one bothers to make them on private servers is because 
---
a) it's a mature server so wild steelbloom is 45 silver each anyways
---
and 
---
b) the market is flooded because the bag drop rate is way too high.
---
But none of the low end bags are tough to make, at all. the recipes up to silk packs are not world drops (well, they are, but there are also trainer versions), and if there is demand, there should be supply. 
---
Really, a LOT of silk cloth should get farmed while leveling. I can't imagine it would be that hard to just say "want 4 silk bags, my mats, 1 gold" in trade chat, and get a taker.
---
Not gnome for the racials?
---
Not that I agree with it, but you don't seem to understand what capitalism is. Anyway, this is really far off-topic and you seem really ragey, so im out.
---
But with if he's an arsehole?  Then rogue is the right choice!
---
I understand it fine, you're just complacent letting big corps fuck you
---
&gt;Warrior-arms with healer
---
Yea, no. Either all classes have a healer or none. And then Warrior is A at best, probably more B. And Ele shaman is definitely S tier.
---
that is interesting but these will be fresh servers, so maybe time window and new servers won't have it? If people don't even want Dire Maul in the game they can't say that the mounts are not in that time frame, it's just people feeling jealous about not wanting to work in that time frame to get the mount, and other people wanting it to stay "super rare" which this time around it would admittedly be less rare. Either way it seems somewhat selfish.
---
Something you'd be willing to level to 35 at some point for max professions, so you can go alchemy for arcanite transmute. Hunter or Warlock are easy to get to 35.
---
People probably realize now how much stronger pallies are than shaman. For pve and pvp.
---
There are two types of players: those who decided their class quickly, and those who, no matter how much deliberation, won't know until launch day.
---
People who think a joke has to make THEM laugh don;t understand the word subjective
---
Love WOW, love life more!
---
Either hunter for my main class, dear to my heart, or a paladin to tank then heal for my group of friends. Probably hunter though, in my case it's pretty much set, just some backup plans.
---
I know people with family who play basketball for 4 hours after work a day. Counting weekends, all they do is play 30 hours of basketball per week.
---
It's all about your passion.  You'll make time for it.
---
I hope you enjoy WSG too!  Feral druid is so bad ass in WSG if you dedicate time to figuring out your pvp timings.
---
That's fair. But an arms warrior with a pocket healer is more deadly than any other combo I think. So maybe warrior belongs in A tier.
---
Had the case happen in MoP. I regret going Horde with them since they later quit the game... Good thing they're going Alliance this time around.
---
It's just very suboptimal when it comes to actual damage output.
---
At least you have friends who want to play classic
---
Yes. Every single poll and the beta/stress-test census data shows this.
---
On Alliance it will be:
---
1. Warrior (~17%)
---
2. Mage (~14%)
---
3. Paladin (~14%)
---
4. Priest (~13%)
---
5. Rogue (~11%)
---
6. Hunter (~11%)
---
7. Warlock (~10%)
---
8. Druid (~10%)
---
On Horde it will be:
---
2. Shaman (~15%)
---
3. Warlock (~14%)
---
4. Mage (~13%)
---
5. Priest (~13%)
---
6. Rogue (~12%)
---
7. Hunter (~8%)
---
8. Druid (~8%)
---
No idea how this will shake out at level 60.
---
yeah dwarf is strong but trust me whenever you're rooted you will be wishing you were a gnome. obv removing blind is pretty nice too but you won't be blinded as nearly as much as slowed/rooted. when i tried dorf best use i had out of stoneform was removing annoying diseases in pve tbh
---
They could easily make it only 15 days playtime and lower the price accordingly. A 300+ gold token would warp the endgame economy in really bad ways. On pservers you'd have to farm three hours for one flask.  Assuming you only raided one night a week and only buy one flask you could get by just paying and raidlogging. They would need to restrict how much you could buy in some way or things would get out of hand very quick. You don't want to encourage a play pattern where you need to pay money just to get by.
---
Ret was better in BC. By the end of BC they were a face roll OP damage dealer. Stayed strong through wrath.
---
How would this possibly work, the problem would be the exact same in the 50-60 zones after they disabled layering.
---

(Shit) All DPS specs not listed.  Play these if you want to have a really tough useless road.
---
I don't think there is "unviable" in terms of classic content. For arms, I think it actually starts out as higher DPS due to not having all of your hit/crit gear in place yet. Offhands miss like crazy, so 2h arms is actually totally viable, at least for the start. You will even see a lot of tanks doing 2h arms while leveling/tanking dungeons.
---
Ignore the people who whine or who say that the healer is carrying them. I'll be playing a healer myself, and ill be super happy if im healing a 2h arms tank (at least until 60).
---
Told my wife the same, she struggled a bit at first until I turned her to the light side. Now she's wanting to play BL3 with me, told her no. It's WoW Classic launch ain't got time for that shit.
---
Depends on what kind of macros blizz will allow. If macros work, yes you would be and to easily trap a melee.
---
I'm making all 3 cloth this time around. Mage first. Priest alt with alchemy transmute. And scale up a warlock very slowly and swap him in to raid for t3 gear and then melt faces ultra late game. Mage first for utility and farming and easy quality of life traveling and teleporting around the world. free drinks.
---
That's the biggest insult in the whole thing. 
---
Blizz telling us layering is ESSENTIAL. Meanwhile people have been playing on private servers without it with no problem for the past decade.
---
Do you have an example of how to play paladins?
---
I would rate Enhancement Shaman on C Tier. The flashy WF procs on montages are really great and all, but they are pretty bad with no form of CC (or CC-Breakers) and not-so-great gap closers (Frost Shock and Earthbind only).
---
In situations where raid/party damage does not exceed the healing of Rank 3 Healing Touch, how long would it take for overhealing caused by Rank 4 Healing Touch to lead to the druid to go OOM, and how long after that would the raid/party wipe?
---
Possibly.  I played Alliance pretty much the whole time I played retail, only dabbling in Horde towards the end of my time playing.  Another friend who would play whatever, and another who would essentially only play human female characters (except his twinked gnome rogue).
---
I kind of want to try maining as a Troll hunter this time around (I was a human priest before).  One friend will be fine with this, the other not so much.
---
It's like they think we're idiots or something
---
That defeats the purpose of TipsOut's tournament = his stream revenue. He needed sight on every single duel.
---
How do I be you?
---
and to think, cenarius son threw it deep in her and created the centaur race..
---
Are we allowed to use addons that change the look of the game? For example an addon that makes it look like everyone has new models? My friends thinks we are, but I thought I read that's bannable.
---
Utilizing [Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) and Furor talent from restoration tree gives you 60 energy every time you shapeshift, so power shifting is effectively using all of your energy, and shifting out and back into cat form to reset your energy instead of waking for it to refill on its own.
---
[Here's a video of someone doing it on the beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNlNgwPjKwc) although he's only using furor so he gets 40 energy instead of 60. Keep an eye on his energy bar and watch how it shoots up after his energy reaches 0.
---
Go horde. Kill them all!
---
Play a dwarf priest so you get BWL spots even in your level 40 greens for being the only combination that gets fear ward
---
Sure, from a min-max stand point, but in general they use pretty similar stats. You raid/dungeon gear will do just fine in classic pvp. It's not like there is resilience or pvp power. There arent shadow vs holy sets. 
---
From what I remember, rank 10 is the blue pvp gear, and not all that hard to get if you can play a decent amount (20-25hrs a week maybe). Other than that your only option is what I said. Honestly, if you healed as holy and got some gear that way, you could use that as shadow and be better of than the avg person.
---
Probably not, otherwise people wouldn't be complaining. Most people are comparing classic to private, not vanilla
---
I still think they will be the least played class, but it won't be as extreme as it is on private servers for 2 reasons:
---
1. Private servers tend to have a higher percentage of vanilla veterans who are more invested in min/maxing and playing the strongest classes.
---
2. Druid is the most popular class in retail and we'll see quite a lot of casual retail players trying out their favourite class in classic.
---
I want to give horde a try so badly, but I remember leveling alts and hating the zones and quests so much. The cities are just not my thing either, I always get lost and fall off of stuff.
---
Thats not what he asked though
---
If you don't like it, fine, don't subject yourself to it.  
---
But don't assume to know what others want.
---
The clusterfuck of a server launch is honestly 50% of the experience for me every time a Pserver or new expansion drops.
---
2 questions:
---
Is your guild recruiting for Classic and what region will you play on? If you're recruiting, I'd love to join and raid for you as I really love this system (if timing and raid schedule lines up with my schedule that is). =]
---
That Human Paladin was looking pretty tempting.  Yeah, maybe I'll swing for Holy.  Wait, hang on, if I'm going Priest Shadow is the way to go for sure... gotta roll Horde then, guess Shaman is on the menu boys.  It's decided then, I'll roll Tauren Druid
---
I don't know that off the top of my head.
---
I see. Thanks for the info!
---
And in the case when you are actually 60? I'm scared of constantly respeccing for PvP and PvE.
---
Just pay the sub and you get classic, dont have to buy everything and you get everything up to legion as well.
---
For me it’s closer to: 
---
Me: Wanting to play the game for fun
---
Friends: Here is the best in slot list, best class for each race, better pick gnome healer if you’re going priest otherwise why bother.
---
...
---
Me: picks hunter on opposite faction because they aren’t going to wait for me during leveling anyway.
---
Pointless story, but I remember I once made a Gnome warrior back end of vanilla on Kazzak eu. I was minding my own business running to feathermoon stronghold in feralis to get some quests. On the way I seen a 2 or 3 level higher level female orc hunter. We ran past each other and I noticed her stop and had that same disgusted racist look as you probably have. Naturally being the aggressive faction she opened fire into my pretty pink pigtails.
---
I went into berserker, intercepted and then proceded to absolutely butcher her  
---
After all those years it still warms my heart.
---
I bet it was you, hah.
---
Worgen Death Knight. Done and done.
---
Its hard to quantify exactly where each spec lands.
---
Do we include variants within a spec, i.e. survival hunter / marksman within pvp?
---
If so, then the list is like 50 specs deep.
---
I am just not interested into changing into animals/beasts.  I think most people agree with this.  If I wanted to be an animal, I would just be a panda.
---
2560x1600 is a very rare resolution, Newegg only sells one and it's for consoles, did you mean 3840x1600? In which case, you should just go the full 4K.
---
It introduced LFG though so it loses style points
---
The point is the server community, not the classic community.
---
It is only one race in vanilla for each faction, Troll druid were added later iirc...
---
Thanks for this. Formatting on my phone sucks.
---
Dwarf Hunter. I'm 6'3" and find playing a short character a nice change of pace.
---
A guild that doesn't cuss too much . One that is pretty tolerant of players making mistakes and would rather teach members to get better than just complain.  One that doesn't go on and on about real life stuff. I get that it's nice to talk about the latest event, but games are escapism for me. I don't want to keep hearing about how you're relationship with your girlfriend is going
---
The second part is true but the first part isn't.
---
mm/sv rogue. cool
---
yup humans, instead of using +hit talents can put those points into damage, thus increasing their dps
---
The overall realm community will be plenty cohesive with cross-realm battlegrounds.
---
Is there a macro that is letting him shift so fast it never shows anything other than a poof or a cloud around him? I hadn’t seen this before. I also thought feral gets a big buff in a later patch to make it raid viable.
---
Def take improved slice n dice over either of the other 3/3 Assass talents
---
It reads to me that's what he  asked.
---
He said 2 races. NE and Taurens = 2.
---
hahahahahhHahHahahhaha
---
I love how your start your post as "lets clear the misi formation" and then just give more misinformation.
---
Subs
---
Melee (mostly warriors/rogues) scale the best, especially with the world buffs. Fury will eventually do more damage than arms, mainly due to scaling better, but unless you are in a super tryhard guild (that is mostly going for clear times, not necessarily clearing content - thats easy) you will be fine as arms.
---
For PVP you will want to be arms anyway. Mortal strike in vanilla disgusting. You will be able to do just fine as arms in all aspects of the game, although for a couple (farming/later raiding) fury would be slightly better, but not to the point that arms is invalidated. You will rarely find yourself saying "if only I was fury" rather you will be saying "man I want a healer" or "wow imagine what I could do with blessing of freedom."
---
Only cowards and the worst types of liars play gnomes...
---
Found the priest!
---
The only good Gnome is a dead Gnome
---
Why did you expect to look like a catacylsm-wearing tauren :)
---
If you are bad and can't play your class properly, some buffs and flasks won't make you better for a raid than skilled players who are lazy.
---
98% of your comments in this sub are downvoted.

The worst part is that it's at the END of august. By the time it finally rolls around we still gotta wait a whole damn month

I know that.  It still scales better when you consider the cast speed.
---
Is this website correct? Was the PvP server seriously a 71 - 29 split?
---
But your chances of running into that person again are (#oflayers) times lower.

Layering essentially murders the social dynamic of the world.

Could you imagine willingly playing alliance?

I'd think I'd actually kms

I don’t understand what you’re trying to get at. Of course I’m showing a narrative that fits my statement, I’m demonstrating that it’s possible that boomkins would be more worthy to bring.

If the meme spec isn’t pulling his share in the guild then ofc don’t bring it. Why would you? But the idea that the only way you can clear Mc trash is with 20 fury wars and mages is so dumb. This subreddit has this ridiculous elitist circlejerk; ironically for a game with one of the lowest pve skill floors

Check again with lvl 40s.
---
And I hope it works.
---
What’s nice is you can technically get away with a single hybrid spec and single set of gear for healing and pvp dps. Unfortunately you’re more of a totem bot and will end up oom a lot.
---
I played Horde and Alliance pretty much 50/50 in all the years I played. I have friends on both sides and Im really struggling to make a decision.
---
There is no open beta outside of the last two stress tests. The closed beta is shutting down in a week or two so they can do bug fixes before the final test prior to launch.
---
I’m debating who to main
---
Dwarf shadow priest or Nightelf hunter
---
Sooo hard
---
For world pvp and pve
---
Running a guild with friends I’ll be the lone shadow priest or a hunter. Have yet to decide
---
How else are you supposed to reset threat? ^/s
---
Haha, I forgot that tabards used to be cool!
---
Organization, goals, a niche. Its simply not enough to be a good guild. A guild must have a purpose and people dedicated to the fulfillment of that purpose.
---
Short Answer- Mage
---
it was a robochicken pet.
---
Warrior+Paladin can 2v2 probably any other combo, the biggest threat would be Priest/Lock. Anything else will pretty much just get trounced.
---
I'm running it on i3 6200, Z170mobo, GTX950, 8GB 2666GHz RAM and 256ssd. I can run it on max settings at 1440p nand my CPU never goes above 40C and my GPU is stable in mid 50's, stock only cooling.
---
Seriously, it's not an intensive game.
---
Could NE and Human ride mecho-striders before expansions? Because I know at release they could not.
---
Exactly the info I was looking for. Thank you so much.
---
Thank you
---
Got lucky with the next day shipping huh? They must've noticed you checking it out :P
---
It's been said before but I must say it again, thank you!!
---
Ram best mount.
---
Mara is a pretty beautiful place
---
There was a nightelf rogue i used to watch all the time on warcraft movies. 
---
Completely forgot the name. 
---
Onyxia wipe animation is obviously a classic.
---
Druids solo them easy
---
I found it funny anyway 😂😂😂
---
Leave it as is and let us deal with overpopulation like we did for years.
---
Death is too good for gnomes
---
People at the bottom of the lists can always grab loot that nobody at the top wants. They just have to sacrifice a few ranks, rather than dozens.
---
didn't pservers make extensive use of dynamic spawning to combat the overpopulation-problem?
---
That's still pretty crazy. Even if you do levels 30-40 there is still a 63% - 37% split.
---
I’ve got the scent.
---
Technically bannable, as this is what a very popular "addon" used to do. 
---
In reality, I am not aware of a time that blizzard took action on someone doing this (and just model changing), but the risk is still there.
---
Good on you for ignoring them, what a douche...
---
Their implication being "blizzard handing you ilvl 390 gear is nbd because it's not the ilvl of the highest lvl mythic raiding gear" smh
---
Aye sweet vid!
---
You come in severely uninformed, ask a question the core premise of which is invalid, and are called on it. You proceed to assert that anyone who has called out your ignorance is in fact bigoted.
---
I'd suggest some self reflection is in order, but I know it would be pointless.
---
I'm kind of surprised at the low number for the incredibly broken warlock era
---
Even worse, I'm going to be playing the most out of any of my friends, and I dont care which one I play aslong as I'm playing with my friends, but they just wanna follow me.
---
Yelp i asked the one buddy of mine if he was going to play classic, well he said yes and him and his wife are going to go alliance :/.
---
Shifting out of form doesn’t cost a gcd. So normally you would use a macro to cancel your form and instantly shifting back in
---
/HumbleBrag??? I played vanilla when I was younger and the only time I remember playing 8 hours was the day we raided MC. (Prep work before included.) That was a long ass time and I remember feeling like a drained zombie after. Teenage me decided that I would never spend that long in front of the computer again.
---
I think fewer Warriors/Paladins will reach 60. 40-60 is such a fucking chore, those two classes are rough to level.
---
My biggest question is if, as a Night Elf Warrior Tank, I will struggle to hold aggro if I'm already a relatively experienced tank.
---
Can I tank up through Naxx as a Night Elf Warrior Main Tank or off-tank? Is the loss of rage/threat from damage going to be that huge?
---
World Buff EXPLOIT
---
Just what a non-boomkin would say
---
That’s not the alternative what
---
No, and it's not exactly close. Look at the modifiers that Shadow Bolt benefits from:
---
- 10% (Shadow Mastery - talent)
---
- 15% (Shadow Weaving)
---
- 10% (Curse of Elements)
---
- 20% (Improved Shadow Bolt)
---
- Minus 75 Shadow resistance (Curse of Elements)
---
Here are all of the modifiers that Lightning Bolt benefits from. I'm excluding Stormstrike because you will never have a debuff slot for it in a raid that reaches Naxx:
---
- Concussion (5%)
---
Even though you can cast 20% more Lightning Bolts than Shadow Bolts thanks to the faster cast time, Shadow Bolt is still king. Both get 85.7% of spellpower.
---
Shaman only shine when stuff dies before all of those debuffs can get applied. Like in PvP and on adds.
---
What I miss the most is not being able to transfer my TCG items. That really sucks.
---
What was the best tank class? I never played classic and have heard so many conflicting opinions :/
---
&gt; what OP complains still holds true "you just wanted to spectate the biggest community event on Beta, but their layer was full"
---
I think what a lot of people don't understand about layering is that without it, this statement simply becomes "you just wanted to spectate the biggest community event on Beta, but you sat in a queue because the server was full".  For all it's negatives, layering lets people **actually play the game**
---
Thinking too much in it. This a social game so you might as well play with friends rather than have a slight advantage playing solo on Horde
---
Best bet would be to look up healing guides and see how the playstyle feels to you.  
---
Priest and Druid both play similar enough that you could pick either one. Shaman have a different playstyle and have totems to add into the mix so it's not always the easiest to do when you have to keep track of totems and player HP.
---
Dude, I was on Silver Hand on day 1. There were tons of groups at each named mob. In some instances you have to sit there for an hour if you want to complete the quest. For every one group that completes, 2 more show up to do it.
---
What is the fun in that? The objective is to be as inclusive as possible. Do you really think some casual gamer is going to want to sit there for an hour to complete a quest with no advancement?
---
Competition for mobs is archaic and unnecessary. Layering will help tremendously in the beginning. As time goes on and people are spread out among levels, it will be less necessary and Blizzard will taper it off before eventually doing away with it 100% in phase 2.
---
I honestly don't understand why anyone would think its fun to compete with your own faction over questing. Let everyone be able to enjoy the content as it was intended.
---
If anything, I would think all the purists would be in favor of layering. If blizzard just left it at 10k pops with no layering, it would be NOTHING like original release in 2004. It would be extremely overpopulated. You would also run into the issue of not making any meaningful connections because there would be so many people it would be impossible to have meaningful interactions.
---
Tidd
---
exploit. sure. gotcha.
---
It's literally the same picture
---
Simple. How's the wife? How are the kids? Hey btw, Wow Classic is coming out... Most of my friends are 30's/40's and have a lot going on. Some of the guys that I played with that were super addicted when we were younger I avoided bringing up the topic.
---
What is the best pvp resto/tank flag carrier spec for Druid’s? Is it viable to heal in raids?
---
Racials are ridiculously unimportant.  By all means play what you want to play tho.  The bigger problem will be settling on a race that you’re not into or are not really interested in.
---
They provide that juicy crit aura though.  So they could, theoretically, stand around casting downranked Starfire until the priest needs innervated.
---
Your friends are only as good as the things that connect you together.
---
If you don't think you'll have more regrets not playing with your friends than the regrets you'll have over racial bonuses, then they're not very good friends.
---
Ya
---
It's literally just Crul'shorukh. [There are so few axes for tanking its kind of laughable to suggest otherwise.](https://youtu.be/KLp-vA_KBUo?t=1m0s)
---
Here I did this quick for you.. just my opinion  
---
https://i.imgur.com/Vytu3bX.png
---
Will a druid and shaman combo be viable in pvp against a top tier combo like a warrior/priest/mage/warlock?
---
Excellent meme.
---
Side note--Blizz removed the ability to tame corehounds in classic right?
---
&gt;  I’m demonstrating that it’s possible that boomkins would be more worthy to bring. 
---
Except this is not a criteria exclusive to Boomkin, you can use this criteria with literally any class. Any player with any class can be worthy of a raid spot if he contributes to a guild in a positive way. The thing is, you are trying to show what would make a Boomkin worthy to bring to a raid over any other viable raid spec and the fact is there is nothing. 
---
3% caster crit? Just bring a real caster dps who can easily make up for the buff that the Boomkin provides. Innervate? You have Resto Druids for that. Any other kind of hybrid class utility? Shamans bring totems that melee classes will die for, Paladins can cast Blessings and Bubble among other things, also both Enh and Rets can use Nightfall that buff the output of casters while also doing more damage than the casters. Even Feral Druid is more useful since they can do decent dps if played properly while also providing a passive. Boomkins damage output is just terrible.
---
This is the best advice. In the end you will have more fun playing with your friends than taking advantage of any minimal perks
---
Reckoning builds, though there are a few variants. Reckoning is the only thing paladins have that properly addresses their fundamental weakness of being a cast-time only healer while also being almost entirely dependent on auto attacks for damage (y'know, cuz cast-time spells reset your swing timer, and holy shock sux). The other builds, full holy/dedicated healing and ret are too pigeonholed into their respective specs and they're quite maladaptive for an otherwise extremely versatile class. They have no proper answer for that fundamental problem.
---
Haha, I remember this as well! People used to shout about it in Ironforge.
---
I don't actually know what you mean by paladin to shaman shenanigans :o
---
Tauren Druid or Undead Rogue 🤔
---
I played a pally to 60 and did some healing, so sometimes I feel the urge to just be a dps and see what it feels like to out dps someone.. but also I love Druid.
---
Really? Surprising there are conflicting opinions. It's pretty well established that warriors are close to being the 'only' tanks. I think nowadays you will be able to get by with prots and ferals for lower end content, but back in the day tanking outside of warriors was considered a high crime. 
---
Before people get mad, I'm happy to heal prot pallies and feral druids, and they do have have some strengths (especially while leveling). Mostly multi-target snap threat. 
---
However, by BWL/NAX, you really won't see much outside of warriors tanking. They just have too much in their kit relative to the other classes. I am sure some guilds will still find room for the occasional prot pally or feral druid though, or at least I hope so.
---
&gt; WoW's Success = launch chaos? That seems like a really far reach.
---
Yes, actually. The insanity leads to people grouping up for quests so it's easier to get objectives for a larger number of people. Most people that advocate for layering seem to be doing so from a solo player perspective. In vanillia WoW you pretty much had to party up for everything and it was great.
---
Play with friends or don't. 
---
Do you plan on playing longer than 3 months? Will most of your friends be gone by then?
---
Didn't Soda play Druid?
---
nice copy/paste from 2005!
---
Yes, it is an exploit.
---
You just helped me confirm that I should main a druid after all haha
---
Itll be negligible, roll what you want!
---
No, You're dumb as shit for thinking so. I'm mocking you.
---
I felt the opposite way back then. I couldn't level any alliance toon past lvl 10. People complain about org but uc was where it's at. I liked staying there most of the time.
---
Huh ok guess I’ll be trying something new out thanks for the input
---
Nope, because my friends aren't scum and chose the correct faction 15 years ago.
---
That's how you spend your time?
---
I think if anyone's acting like a cry baby it's the guy following me around on every subreddit I enter.
---
Huh ok guess I’ll be trying something new out. Thanks!
---
All of this, man.  I can't wait to play druid.  I mained paladin at first, then made the right decision to go Horde and went troll shaman.  But then I found my love for druid.  I felt so much more in control healing as a druid than I did with any other class I'd played.
---
I want to tank as feral this go around.  I want that AOE tanking goodness.  That sweet damage tank, muah!  I'm so excited.
---
They did make an uproar. Then the beta launched and streamers made it popular and the old people who wanted a real classic server are booed and downvoted out of the sub.
---
Kind of strange memory, but I had an alliance mage and my friend was leveling an Orc warrior and asked me to help pl him. So I equipped a cheap wand and after every battle would sheep him (for quick heal) then wand him to break sheep. Pretty unintended but worked well.
---
duo's don't really happen in vanilla, unless you're super lucky to be traveling with a friend, and happen upon another duo.
---
99.9 times out of 100, it's lopsided 1v5, 2v8, 3v1, etc.
---
This is exactly me! Been an undead priest forever... have to go dwarf now... :(
---
shaman mage easily handles them.
---
Honestly not sure which one is the 'princess' in this scenario...
---
&gt; but currently blizzard seems to have implemented their layer system differently only because they want to deny players options like they do with every other system they create.  It almost always ends up being more confusing than the just industry standard solutions as well, not to mention having their own set of problems.
---
This sub in the minority here because we actually care about these things.  You aren't supposed to see or care about them.  I know quite a few people interested in coming back for Classic and they don't know anything about layering or spell batching.  For them, the system is transparent and seamless.  They tell their friends they're on the realm "Lawbringer" and then they log in, group up, do content.  At no point did they have to care what "layer" they were on, it was just handled for them.
---
They should jump ship to CD projekt red.
---
Mind you I read the working conditions were hectic to say the least.
---
Thanks. So arms for tanking. Is it more engaging/interactive/challenging than fury?
---
Seeing streamers &amp; their fans getting annoyed is fantastic entertainment imo.
---
boy I'm gonna miss transmog.
---
Like I said, it's mostly just an artifact of not having horde data for low levels. If you check level 30 by itself it's 86 - 14 split. Then if you check 31+ it's 59-41 split. So yeah seeing as it's a tiny server with a huge streamer influence it's seem relatively balanced and we really can't draw anything meaningful with what faction balance will be like on live realms.
---
I’m pretty sure I’m going to play a rogue. My problem is  deciding on human or night elf. People keep telling me human for swords but I like how the night elves look and what if I wanted daggers instead? Well, at least I know the class.
---
I've always found it quite enjoyable myself.  Silverpine and Hillsbrad are some of my favorite zones to level in.
---
Looking forward to leveling up fishing/cooking while leveling in classic.
---
That's a pretty common misconception I see here.  That's not how it works.
---
Personally, most drama tends to be people not being listened too and loot. 
---
However, a bit of drama is quite fun imo.
---
you can't farm gold in retail?
---
Like they said. "You think you do but you dont"
---
Well a buddy and I and going to be playing nonstop together so we will have 2 at least.
---
Truth, the amount of times I've encountered this talking to some horde players is insane, i'm fine with rolling both i just prefer alliance in vanilla
---
30 Feral / 21 Resto. Heart of the Wild and Nature's Swiftness are key, everything else is up to you and how you play outside of raids. I like this build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505012130302215-05501310231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505012130302215-05501310231)
---
Some people swear by Swiftmend for running flags. You get an extra instant heal but sacrifice some survivability and utility. (Not being able to use Faerie Fire in Bear Form is painful against Rogues.) Something like this would work: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140003-0550001-055013105315021](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140003-0550001-055013105315021)
---
Both specs have been used to heal all raid content. My 30/21 build can tank anything as well. The difference between these builds and a "PvE" build is so small that it's not noticeable. You won't be holding your group back if you raid with these builds.
---
at least you have beta, shut
---
Personally i would take great satisfaction out of secretly ganking them if you're going rogue.
---
They are both pretty fun. Arms probably a little more so pre-40 if you like to see big numbers and like procs. Mainly from overpower crits because of the arms talent which adds 50% crit. Fury is fun too with flurry and bloodthirsty but not as fun for me pre40. I've leveled a ton of warriors and that's just my opinion on how they feel.
---
This triggers my PTSD of when I had to farm her for gold. Do you happen to have fanart of Tinkerer Gizlock and the Alligator too?
---
Listen man, if you go over my comments you’ll see I’m not vouching that boomkins are good in a raid. I’m arguing that it’s nice to have someone who’s gonna be a member of the guild that has the ability to fill any role in a 5/10 man, who has a lot of power in farming consumables, and who isn’t gonna leave (who the fuck would take a boomkin). 
---
All I’m saying is that quality of player &gt; quality of character when you have at LEAST 40 people that need to get along twice a week for hours at a time in sometimes very stressful situations. I completely understand if people would rather have top tier DPS specs and classes at the cost of some jerks, and I respect guild leaders that can keep groups like that together (and I envy groups of 40 top tier specs that are all also nice). 
---
However, from a lot of the comments I’ve seen in this subreddit, there’s this mentality where if you have a boomkin = you’re gonna have to spend another hour in a raid. When in all actuality it’s an addition of maybe 1.5-2% of the bosses health you have to burn through, which (as evidenced by people on pservers regularly and quickly clearing overtuned content) is not at all an issue.
---
Don’t fill your raid with meme specs. But don’t turn down good people to fill a spot or two in a 40 man raid. I see a lot of people talking about the community in the WoW of yore being an amazing place, but this subreddit is just indoctrinating folks with this toxic elitist mentality that only the best will do.  Unless you’re pushing for server firsts or scarab lord, a ret pally, enh shaman or boomkin isn’t gonna make or break your raid.
---
Sham are way better raid healers with chain heal, but pallies are strong with their mana regen on crits and buffs where they can basically keep healing forever.
---
&gt; I love how they won’t remove leeway
---
People need to chill tf out, they haven't even commented at all officially on leeway.  It's bugged in its current state and is likely going to be addressed before release.
---
"We played just fine without this sharding/layering bullshit the first time around " No there were constant disconnects and server crashes not to mention multiple hour long queues. 
---
"the game had WAY more active players than it does now." No. Original WoW launch did not even have close to how many people are going to be joining this launch. Literally the launch for BFA still had crashes, 3 hour long queues, and disconnects constantly. Now imagine the same amount if not more players on a smaller total number of servers. I would like to actually play the game thanks.
---
I’m a firm believer the Vanilla-TBC-Wrath is the greatest trilogy ever created.
---
They should run the server with yearly cycles, pushing Vanilla in TBC and TBC in Wrath.  If you wanna stay Vanilla, you don’t advance.  You could play out the entire trilogy, or stay in your happy zone.
---
Just remember that you live in the Barrens, it is your new home and only the strong lowbies survive.
---
As I said before, I pretty much only went into BGs with full guild groups where we just moped the floor with pug after pug that was thrown against us. So why do I need a profession to make that easier than it already was?
---
Alchemy. You're going to need a lot of Arcanite Bars in your time.
---
Well I'm glad you included how it works in your reply.
---
Do you prefer big thick tauren ones instead?
---
Are gnomes going to be back to their smaller size from vanilla? I remember a while ago there was that comparison of gnomes in vanilla vs the beta rn
---
Being tiny in a huge world.
---
No flying.
---
Can’t relate. Ever since I sold my account after killing LK I’ve dreamed and longed for a return of classic wow.
---
I’ve never been interested in private servers because they go down, or too laggy, or just generally horrible.  Get to have the classic experience with the technical support of legit servers. 
---
Aug 27 can’t get here soon enough.
---
UC and org werent THAT bad honestly, UC is a maze but not too hard to figure out.  thunder bluff was the bane of my (short) horde existence.
---
I thought it was common sense, you don't take the results of a poll and then double them.  Why do *you* think you need to oversample shaman and pally?
---
9/11/31 probably, gives you natures grasp, better ability to root while being hit (although this is usually for like a rogue midfield, you should otherwise be travel/bear most of the time). It is very much raid heal viable.
---
There is an argument for 0/30/21, although you lose things like natures grasp which is a big deal. You also lose some instant healing in favor of more stamina in bear. This might be better for a full premade where you will have constant support, whereas the earlier one is better for a less coordinated group. This is still raid healing viable, but not as good.
---
Druid and warrior are both of the viable tanks. 
---
Druid is really good in dungeons. Some say they are actually better than warriors from 1-60. They will also off tank a few raid bosses at lvl 60.
---
Warriors are your MT for lvl 60 raids.
---
humanboy yee haw
---
What's your weight for wPvP, duels, and bgs? Arms should not be that high unless bgs is over 50% because they're worse than warlock/hunter PvE specs in duels or any world PvP that doesn't involve healers. 
---
Honestly, I'd move ele to S and add desto lock to A. After MS warriors and  hunters for defense, I value casters that can erase a MS warrior under 2 healers with a little bit of help for BG dps. Sub daggers or the 21/8/22 build is top shelf 1v1, but is definitely not the best rogue spec to take to BGs. Cooldown and stealth reliance makes them enh shaman tier or stealthed for half the bg.
---
How can they do that? ... You know for science.
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
if leeway stays the way it is, i think tauren is the obvious choice for the FATTY range on melee swings, warstomp, and youre a fucking HUGE warrior
---
Or you could just use [the faction specific polls](https://i.redd.it/smdyb81dz9531.jpg).
---
&gt; If their primary concern is cutting costs, why bother with layering at all?
---
It doesn't cost them money to implement sharding/layering because it was already in the BFA client they back ported. Simply put not doing sharding costs them more since they moved away from a server to server system a long time ago. 
---
&gt; Do they implement a server for every Euro language?
---
They only had English at first, at least French, German, Spanish. They already know which ones to do because they have live retail servers to go off of. It's not like it's a list that goes on forever, the only excuse is because they didn't want to buy more servers or hire more CMs to monitor the tickets for the dedicated language servers.
---
&gt; Blizzard changed tack 
---
They shouldn't have to change track for something so obvious as dedicated language servers for EU. It shows they underestimate their market potential for Classic severely.
---
&gt; If sharding was layering rebranded, why bother rebranding it?
---
Because sharding in Classic was a fucking meme and bad business, that's why companies rebrand things. Now they made an argument for dummies to argue that "it's not sharding it's layering!" despite it having the same end result. Everyone hates sharding even in current wow, it's a system that devs like and that's why the continue to push it because Blizzard is all for lazy solutions.
---
Roll dwarf! Join us on the ally side!
---
Dynamic spawning was used when Vanilla launched in 2004.
---
I'm just wondering what a hate list is. Maybe a blacklist of players you dont wanna play with?

Lots of people roll a healing class but don't actually want to heal.
---
Those would be your Enh Shamans, Ret Paladins, Shadow Priests, etc.
---
Thanks mate!
---
Yeah, didn't know where those were. That works better.
---
Damn, thanks for the information but I'm gonna be playing horde. Best of luck to you all!
---
Ret isn’t as bad as people will try to tell you. You can do more than reasonable dps if you are up for farming consumables and itemizing properly. Don’t let people steer you away from something you wanna play. Pretty much anything can work within reason if you put in the effort
---
Warlock or warrior for most fun/well rounded. (Planning in doing PvP + raiding dps)
---
- Dispel teammates and yourself. Especially things like CC's and viper stings.
---
- Put the right blessings on the right people at the right time. Freedom on flag carrier for example. Sacrifice on a teammate so you take damage that breaks you out of sheep.
---
- Use the right auras at the right time. A paladin that juggles auras is almost guaranteed to be decent because he's at least paying attention to his utility.
---
- Stun the right people at the right time.
---
Nice vid, subbed.
---
&gt; There were tons of groups at each named mob.
---
That doesn't stop you from leveling. If you want to keep yourself in the bottle neck that't not stopping anyone else from leveling up around you. 
---
&gt; The objective is to be as inclusive as possible
---
No it's not. The objective is to be as true to Classic as possible. You got bottlenecked back then too, and people could still level up, they could still play. 
---
&gt; Competition for mobs is archaic and unnecessary
---
Why do you even want to play Classic if you want to change how the game functioned at a core level?
---
&gt; I honestly don't understand why anyone would think its fun to compete with your own faction over questing
---
This isn't the game for you then. In Classic people competed against each other, why should that change now? You don't have to finish all the quests, there aren't even achievements. Just go grind somewhere or level up in a less crowded area. It's not stopping you from playing the game.
---
That's been my experience in Vanilla, so as always I'll advise people to stay away from suboptimal builds if they plan to raid. No matter how seriously or casually you take things, a suboptimal spec choice will pretty much ensure you're stuck with PUGs or guilds that just don't really care.

Like Str1der said, you might find a guild that accepts you, but sooner or later you're going to run into a troublesome boss, and that's where problems arise. People will look for solutions, they'll see half the raid is doing tank-levels of DPS, and then the dedicated portion of your guild will take off and create a new one.
---
I've lived through this, and it wasn't exactly pleasant for the people left behind, so as much as I hate to tell people want to play, do consider what will be expected of you if you select a certain class.
---
Yeah we should give them aids too

Can't wait for BC to use even *less* abilities in raid! At least you sometimes get to use corruption in vanilla when 16 debuff slots are enabled.
---
You aren't going to remember most the people you run into and most of them are going to quit before they reach level 10. If someone is truly worth keeping in touch with, Blizzard has this handy feature called bnet friends.
---
I'm the opposite. We spend so much time in capital cities that Ironforge/Stormwind alone sells Alliance to me. But Horde PvP racials tho...
---
So, Altrec Valley did not last 24 hours or even 12. Sure, there were public games that had been open for a couple days but there were like 12 people in them. Battleground play in Pre-BC is all about honor rank and increasing your honor per hour gained. Altrec Valley was designed to offer a lot of honor IF you take all the towers and other bullshit that is available within the map. It takes a few hours and a lot of coordination to do this. By the time you have finished your three hour Altrec Valley, I would have done 15 WSGS and the honor gap between is in the deep thousands. 
---
Because of this, AV was always, always just a mad dash to the final boss. However, if you only kill the final boss, you get a fraction of the honor. So, it was only consistently ran on AV weekends. On those three special days, you would have 2-5 minute AV games. People seem to be confusing Burning Crusade AV, the elite tower buff? That was only implemented because of everyone bitching about how AV was supposed to be this grand PvP experience that turned into a 3 minute snooze. Drek/Van have less Health than some trash mobs in Molten core and it remained the same for the entire expansion. 
---
They also are keeping the classic bugs, so the wall jump glitch by the frozen waterfall? A few hunters can kill Vann before anyone even has 40 armor scraps. Not too mention, it is completely unpuggable. Air strikes are desperately needed to push certain areas, but they are finite and anyone in the group can call one down.
---
Dwarf Spriest or gnome warrior. I just don’t know right now.
---
If you're facing an enemy orc just don't expect your stuns to stick. Use your other openers. Basically unless you either want to play a shaman or are convinced your friends won'r stick with the game, jusr go ally.
---
This is hilarious / amazing
---
....that's the point I was trying to convey there big chief.
---
That's a good point, but enh shamans are an offensive dispel you can put on the front lines. Ele and shadow priest can do the same, but there are better positions for them most of the time. Besides, whenever they are cc'd, they can still purge.
---
Tremor and poison cleansing are always and grounding is wonderful as well for anti-cc tools. If feral makes B, they should as well.
---
Yep, complete bullshit I have to pay AGAIN, for a game I’ve owned since 2014. Same account and all.
---
Great video! I forgot all about targeting macros
---
Wanna help me with my class choice? I'll gladly run you through my thought process/preferences!
---
and ppl who have a regular job earn 100$ in less than 20h... quick maffs
---
Sad truth
---
Fair enough, a player can be beneficial to his raid regardless of his class, it's just if you have the choice between two solid players you'll tend to choose the one with the better spec.  But yeah, unless you are pushing for top parses or are on progression it doesn't matter that much.
---
What the other guy is saying is that you won't necessarily always be 2v2, in fact that's unlikely. I can't speak to 2v2 scenarios, although I like warrior/healer against druid/shaman if I had to bet.
---
Your combo has a ton of utility, but you are missing the raw killing power of a warrior. Paired with a healer, the big weakness of a warrior (no healing) is negated. Your combo neither has big strengths or big weaknesses. 
---
Your combo may not be dominant in a 2v2 scenario, but you may be able to outlast other combos with cross healing or just the inability to be CCd if you play well. 
---
I guess the biggest strength is that most of the time you will come across people solo, and those people will have ZERO chance of escaping between travel form, roots, and frost shock.
---
It's not about button pressing; it's about fucking the mages over.

Assuming even skill a number of other duos will be better vs you two. That said it's a skill thing, if you play together well you could out match other duos who lack that synergy. I would suggest playing what you like, even with what many would consider bis duo classes there will still be someone who beats you so better to really enjoy what you play.

Just FYI so you don't get caught off guard like I almost did. Technically the launch is Aug 26th 1500 (03:00 pm) PDT if you are in the US.

Gnomes are goats. Sure you can't remove blind but just outplay other rogues.
---
Yea and I doubt those people are gonna buy wow gold with their money....
---
Not when half your server is mages. If you chug FAPs 24/7 then dwarf for sure.
---
Someone posted a comparison of two level 60 mages, one a gnome and one a human, and the stats are honestly not that insane at all.
---
This post highlights why Classic will in no way recreate the Vanilla experience. In Vanilla you played the game and experienced a world. In Classic everyone is only caring about playing the DPS meter and the /played time to 60.  Kinda depressing that this is what gaming is all about now; min-maxing and being a content locust. The thinking that you are useless if you aren’t at 60 the first week and don’t have the opportunity to be #1 on the dps meter is way too prevalent.
---
I like the list below.
---
I am grinding with the intent of 1 of 2 things happening.
---
1. go back and quest at 60 in between raids as something to do to extend "play" time in wow and keep it interesting.
---
2. Not do #1 and level alts through questing. Grinding my first toon out will mean I am not repeating the quests.
---
I could of course just do quests and grind an alt as well but.. I dunno whatever!!
---
Despite what you keep saying, the content you contend to be proving of your skill means very little, not even just here, but even in the context of Catalcysm or the tail end of WOTLK.
---
If I'm going to min max, it's going to be for pvp and not pve
---
Alliance for Vanilla, Horde for everything else.
---
LMAO I've never seen people get so mad that others want to have fun in a game. Good luck lasting very long in Classic.
---
Shhh
---
Wait, you were actually trying to argue here?
---
he got a disaster instead, good for him
---
Hi, this is going to be a novel, but you should read it because your perception of "what it takes" is insanely flawed.
---
I'm Nautix, and I was the very first Horde player on US realms to hit level 80 on release of WotLK, and you have never heard of me (nor the Alliance Ret Pally who beat me.) 
---
I played in a top-30 US guild at the time, Tasty Beverage, on Frostmane (a PvP realm, I was even killed by a rogue while leveling,) and later on I was in the top-10 US guild Gentleman's Club on Korgath. I was one of the first players in the world to have the title "Herald of the Titans" (the item level requirement-based achievement to kill Algalon in Ulduar,) I was *extremely* briefly a member of Blood Legion, and I was in the top slots on WorldofLogs before WoWProgress existed so often I stopped caring.
---
I have extremely little remaining proof of these claims (on the old WoW armory there was a region-wide leader board and I was listed as the second level 80 behind a PvE realm Ret Paladin) aside from an old [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/uFQV2vu) which you can verify has a very early date. You can not believe me if you want, it doesn't affect my life. 
---
The level 80 race was surrounded by controversy because of Athene having other people kill massive amounts of tagged enemies, subsequently having his account temp banned at level 79 and rolled back. He tried the same shit again in Cata, I believe. The official world first level 80 farmed elite elementals in Zul'Drak as a Warlock, which later received a *substantial* XP/kill nerf. He was also from Europe and had a 5 hour head start, so no one gave a shit about US realms. I honestly didn't even know I was the first level 80 Horde player in the US until some one else told me.
---
My leveling speed was the product of playing the WotLK beta and noticing that quest XP was the single largest contributor to XP gains, and also fairly static as I leveled... so I did both starting areas since it was way easier to kill green mobs that didn't matter than it was to kill yellow mobs that didn't matter. Additionally, doing both zones let me entirely skip arguably the worst zone in WotLK for leveling speed: Grizzly Hills (as Horde, it was absurdly better as Alliance, with multiple flight paths and less overall running.) The only bug I abused while leveling was a Marksmanship talent that restored health and mana at a rate 5 times higher than intended on the tooltip. It was never fixed all throughout all of WotLK, was bug reported by me personally in the beta, and clearly no one at Blizz cared enough to fix it. 
---
The main take away from this is that finding an unintended leveling method trumps any other approach to leveling quickly through brute force. You always need an angle. When Classic realms launch, someone may come up with something besides dungeon grinding, but I think it's incredibly unlikely. Classic WoW has been so dissected on Pservers and over its official lifespan that anything short of a dungeon mob XP nerf (offloading kill XP to dungeon quests to retain similar 1-run benefits would be a good fix) won't change anything. 
---
In Classic WoW I met a guy who used to re-roll constantly on new realms named Lareit. He would always race some guy who would always roll a Troll Hunter (Joanna, I believe) and as far as I know he always beat him while playing one of the least survivable leveling classes. Lareit always played a Human Rogue. He did "efficient" shit like grinding mobs when traveling would be slower, and selectively did quests that would improve his ability to grind mobs quicker through quest rewards instead of for the quest XP. He had a system that worked for him, and it also worked better than anyone else who tried to level fast through a gimmick strategy (dungeon grinding has been around forever.) Leveling was literally his hobby, and he perfected his grinding routes over time, and was a very good player overall. The big thing he did though was take other players slowing him down out of the equation: He played a class that was impossible to camp, leveled using a strategy that wasn't reliant on other players, and he put the time in to perfect it.
---
I met Lareit when I played on Zuluhed in a guild called Brimstone which held the record for fastest new realm to Ragnaros kill until the end of Classic (as far as I know, here's a sketchy [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t9N7pqYN4M).) He taught me how to be a good player in a lot of ways... He taunt me to ask why I was doing something a certain way and analyze how I could do it better. It didn't matter if what he was doing was the best strategy, it mattered that he was doing it the best he could. Staying up for 3 days wired on Adderall won't give you that, critical analysis of what you're doing will. I learned a lot from Lareit, and I still remember him fondly to this day. 
---
As for people who abused stimulants and were generally incompetent idiots? I met more of them in the 2 weeks I spent in Blood Legion in the middle of the No Light Yogg-Saron race than I had ever encountered. For every good player in Blood Legion there were 2-3 complete trainwreck idiots that may as well have been following an Icy-Veins guide to how to play their class. They had no idea how to devise good strategies and no idea how classes work besides their own. In the week I joined Blood Legion, I shaved over 2 minutes off their Algalon kill time by dealing with the stars correctly; something they had never even considered how to do prior to me arriving, and actually panicking about completing the encounter in the time window.
---
**TL;DR:** Play the game and enjoy it with other people. No one gives a shit if you're the first person to level 60, and you shouldn't either. There are thousands of people who have been playing Classic on private servers for years, practicing for this launch, perfecting their own strategies no matter how flawed, and will understand the game far more than you do, which gives them a larger advantage than anything out of a bottle.
---
Mods?
---
The thirst.. it comes for us all
---
It's so hard to pick. I want to be a shaman, but warlock was my first love. But priest and mage look fun too!
---
That depends on what we conclude from the numbers, wouldn't you agree?
---
If looking at results from both factions and want to know for instance how common shaman will be on horde then doubling wouldnt be the worst idea, unless the poll was heavily skewed by one faction.
---
Yeah when I was under 18 but then I had to start paying my own bills and life got depressing
---
Awesome! I screenshotted this. I started the last guardian on audio book today (I’m a truck driver). Thank you for the list.
---
I think you underestimate the power of buffs, flasks and elixirs. Even a "bad" player will beat the best player if he has full consumes and the good player doesn't. Of course, the good player would have his consumes and buffs, because he knows how much it buffs his performance anyway.
---
How many times is the mat farming argument going to have to be debunked?
---
More people = more mats = more demand = economy stays neutral. It’s not a hard premise.
---
I think it's baller on orc warriors. Gnomie-bros too.
---
Go for it :D
---
everyone?
---
https://youtu.be/Q_U_VowdeVU
---
None of us have mains yet and already you’re talking about twinks? Impressive.
---
I suspect it's because you have to PvE for warlock PvP gear and pserver people like to minimize their warlocks to 2 per raid for CoE and CoS. CoW and CoR don't seem to be desired at all.
---
I would agree that they have a 1.5 second heal that's roughly equivalent to a lower level Flash of Light.
---
This is wrong.
---
Thanks for the heads up brother, guess I’m taking an entire week off.
---
Launch day?!? You mean 3 weeks after launch when I have 9 level 12s. Right?
---
It's important to note that you will be wearing very little plate until AQ to be doing maximum DPS in a raid setting. You'll essentially be going after the same preraid stuff as rogues and warriors.
---
I work 24/7 on call, typically 60-80 hours a week and while I don't usually play 8hrs a day, I probably average 20-40 hours a week.  
---
  
---
I don't really know what to say for how I "manage" it  
---
It's pretty simple really, when you want to play and you have nothing else you need to do you just play. 
---
      
---
Using your examples you would have plenty of time to play, you kind of make it sound like you go out on dates every single night, and realistically how long does your date last for? If you're allocating like 20 hours a week to dates then that would make sense  
---
Your work hours imply a typical 9-5 job, assuming you sleep for 6 hours, that leaves 10 hours of freetime every day, say you take 5 of those hours doing things you need to do (dates, housework, shopping, going to the post office, etc etc) that still leaves 5 hours every day you could play. not to mention the 18 hours of freetime you have on your 2 days off.  
---
    
---
tldr:
---
+ 24 hours in a day
---
- 8 hours at work
---
- 6 hours sleep
---
= 10 hours freetime  
---
Back when I used to work a regular 9-5 type 40h/wk job and was raiding in 3 guilds, I made a schedule of what I do each week for someone who was curious, maybe it would help you? https://i.imgur.com/nluSJwz.png
---
Time my friend time
---
Troll if you want to be unique.
---
PvP will happen on PvE servers. Go attack crossroads or Tarren Mill.
---
They will come.
---
Alright then, what's the correct information? I have always gone off the same information as WDavis4692 mentioned, so why is it wrong?
---
this is the best solution for sure. layering breaks immersion and is not the vanilla experience. its pure garbage.
---
Do you honestly believe alliance rogues cant shine in world pvp? All races that can be rogues do just fine.
---
Thanks! I plan on doing a rogue one, but I think I need a bit more knowledge first. Have a lot to test.
---
You now know what brain damage looks like.
---
2hrs spent waiting for BG queue.
---
I've always found alliance to be the more aggressive faction.
---
Still not bis.
---
Yeah, but imo it had the perfect class balance.
---
Pretty sure warlocks can summon demons with big schlongs for RP reasons. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I think it's 8/12/31 this will be what I respect to at 60 for all kinds of pvp and pve healing
---
Druid tanks were dogshit before their talent rework. For the majority of Vanilla that was the case, and once they got fixed people still had to figure out how to play and gear them right, so that sentiment persisted.  But Classic is running on 1.12 talents, and we have a decade of 1.12 private servers and theorycrafting that shows Druids are solid tanks and can MT most raids encounters. Look what Skarm is doing on youtube, I will be walking in his footsteps.
---
Nah Crown of Rag is hot as fuck on Tauren. 
---
Only exception
---
And I that have played the beta knows for a fact that layering is not a continent wide system. This is obvious in thunder bluff. Run around thunder bluff and you will see the abomination of layering.
---
Stun resist is, in my opinion, the best racial for warlocks and you don't have to play against undeads.
---
I'd say if they are going to keep it the automatic kick, temp ban, mute or whatever needs to go away.
---
If PVP is the slightest consideration at all the only Shadowpriests and Warlocks you should consider are UD, IMO.
---
Devouring Plague is OP and the Life Tap + Cannibalize combo works too well in pvp and leveling.
---
"Find me irl" lol. Yeah man, you take care nut job.
---
I disagree for locks man, the stun resist is huuuuge in vanilla. Coming from a previous rogue main, I’m definitely trying to avoid that.
---
I am a retard so i will agree with you since you sound smart
---
Tier 0.5 won't be released until phase 4 I believe. They're doing progressive loot tables to mimic the release cycles from vanilla.
---
I farmed the the dogs/first DMN boss on my shaman. It took a lot of practice but I got the hang of using my totems and abusing the outer ledges.
---
I mean, the build released in south park is way different than what we got.  no horde to speak of.  dueling results in death.  human hunters in classic. summon scorpions spell.  the list goes on.
---
&gt; do you really think blizzard would make us fight over questing?
---
If it was released today I'd expect it to look like BfA. Back then servers were full at 2500 people. The same issues wouldn't happen today with the Classic client.
---
&gt; All of these can be accomplished without fighting over mob spawns for the first 6 months.
---
So why not have shared tags or shared nodes? I mean shit then no one is competing. If it wasn't in Classic it shouldn't be there now. Also it's more like a few weeks at most, not 6 months. Don't exaggerate your point to make it sound like it's worse than it is.
---
&gt; "would you have enjoyed 2004 World of Warcraft if it had layering for the first 6 months to ease the population strain?"
---
I don't like it in current wow so absolutely no I wouldn't like it then either, is this a real question?
---
&gt; If I enjoyed playing with someone, I just threw them on my friends list
---
Good luck meeting new people when they're all layered away. Nothing stops people from doing this in current wow but no one does it because everyone is layered and phased away.
---
&gt; Layering doesn't prevent you from talking/grouping with people on other layers.
---
It just separates you completely.
---
&gt; The only downside I can think of to layering is I may not get those grudges I had against specific players on opposing factions since you may not run into them as often.
---
If you think that's the only downside you haven't been paying attention to the arugment AT ALL. People use it to abuse grinding mobs, chests, resource nodes, rare spawns as well as to avoid pvp. It has more downsides than anything it helps. Layering is actually worse than sharding because at least sharding can be confined to the zone it's in. With layering you have bottom heavy servers that allow for much, much more abuse.
---
2 weeks is far too long yet you think 6 months would show no problems? [lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)

Warlocks for raids. Mages for 5mans.
---
Formulas above are false. You gain less than 1% hit from 304 skill.
---
Use [this](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table) for correct formulas, which is backed by testing from the Beta.
---
Also the OP of the comment chain assumes that human rogues will take 2/2 in Weapon Expertise, which they won't, as 1/2 + the racial puts them at 308 and caps the glancing blow reduction at 5%. There's no reason to put another point in Weapon Expertise for
---
But you have a harder time with threat in raids compared to ally locks. &gt;.&lt;
---
Link is dead
---
can't wait to spam a single aoe ability for 2 hours, that sounds great
---
Honestly feel like the first day will be a ton of fun and then days 2/3 - 9/10 is going to blow - I've done those zones hundreds of times... I've always enjoyed leveling in wow, but I just know going through them I'll have to try and change things up.
---
Just hitting level 60 isn't going to be motivation - I'll probably end up working on professions a lot more than rushing to 60.
---
Back on topic though - 100% agree - I haven't given a shit about my characters in wow since Wotlk, and when classic launches - there wont be a need for me to log into retail ever again.

Wait I though cdew was the only shaman in classic beta?

This, plus I always like to level cooking. Between grinding extra scorpids/boars/thunder lizards for meat, and rested Xp, I was always about a level to a level and a half ahead of Joanas guide on pservers.
---
I've yet to encounter a steamer on an empty layer. And it's not filled with memers trying to get in stream. There are people running around playing the game. Payo isn't nearly popular enough to attract asmon/soda type cancer. When I watch him play, the world is constantly full.
---
So no, I don't think I'll find it too hard to find people to play with.
---
I think we just have different ideas as to what's fun. You think fun involves unnecessary bottlenecks and my idea of fun is to play the game as it was intended to be played.
---
Also - if you want a true 2004 experience, do you think that they should lift dungeon caps for the first phase? Just let us Zerg through every instance from RFC up to MC?
---
(Hopping onto this useful comment to elaborate on what we know)
---
4% increase in glancing damage per wep skill is up until 307 wep skill (against a 315 def PvE target) increasing glancing damage from 65% to (65%+(4%*7)) 93%, where the the 8th point to 308 hits the hard cap at a 2% increase: 95% glancing damage.
---
This means getting 5 weapon skill not only potentially increases your hit by 3%, but also raises 40% of your White hit damage vs bosses from 65% to 85%.
---
Another 2-3 wep skill increases that damage even further, while only having a small impact on hit.
---
And, wep skill at 309 or higher has no glancing damage benefit anymore.
---
White hit damage for Rogues is simply that: a change in damage, but for a Warrior, white hit damage directly leads to more Rage, which means more options for skill usage, and even more DPS.
---
In short, 307-308 wep skill is not just hit, but average white damage itself. And while it’s good for Rogues too, it’s massive for Warriors. Never underestimate this.

Go to retail
---
I got my second kid on the way, working about 45h per week, moving into a house in three months. My goal is to play two nights a week, about 3 hours each time. My wife is fine with it. She goes dancing twice a week as well if you're curious. Works for me, but my goal is certainly not endgame. I plan to enjoy the ride.
---
No on retail if you raid mythic you're obligated to use your weekly cap of token purchases to buy expensive raid consumes. I mean you could farm it all by hand but who's gonna do that when tokens are available.
---
UD warlock. Not a terrible racial for PvP. 
---
Underwater breathing comes into a play not often but when it does it's annoying as hell.... but we have water breathing anyways...
---
This!! Spot on Sir.
---
You might want to double check that one.
---
Go get'em champ.
---
It won't be. Go take your poor somewhere else.
---
What is the rush to 60? The whole game is great, take your time and enjoy it.
---
Nobody said anything about transferring gold from retail to classic though
---
It's not
---
good words
---
Debunked? No. The mats are on a static server wide respawn rate. Rich has the same respawn rate as a med pop server. Layering increases that by a factor of how ever many layers there are. It's not a hard premise.
---
A good look at the future?
---
Something I really miss about old wow. New characters
---
Can’t just jump into naxx or aq40, they have to crawl the dungeons, get attuned, get gear, build their characters up and then be able to tackle ‘current’ content, but in classic all content is relevant. It’s really beautiful.
---
Wasn't the mace from AQ real strong?  For a competitive guild ideally the MT will have thunderfury though.
---
Everyone wants a mage. Ports, food, sheep, aoe, and lower threat than melee. And nobody ever complains about adding a second mage.
---
Vanilla WoW is all about the pure class archetypes. If it weren't for only having one button to press in MC, mage would pretty much be the perfect class design.
---
eh, that was the same for any role really. you were always focusing on meters/cd timers/other KPIs of some sort.
---
the walk between bosses &amp; pep talk before pulls was when most of the atmosphere got soaked in and appreciated.
---
You can level an Alliance alt and buff the raid outside with mind control (or at least the Warriors and Warlocks). Can't give Windfury.
---
hitman
---
Absolutely, and no sane guild should be giving daggers to warriors.
---
Yes, read the second part of my comment. I'm saying the implementation doesn't match with the stated design they gave us. 
---
If it worked the way they said it would then I think way less people would have an issue with it.
---
How do rogues fare against shamans and paladins? I don't know myself but i'd assume the plate wearer makes rogues not want to go for them even more so than the orc racial tbh.
---
Snutz, warlock
---
So after a $20 purchase I then pay another $15 each month? Seems greedy tbh
---
I feel like Alliance also has their share of boring zones. 
---
Also the Alliance aesthetics/themes are less interesting to me. I like night elves and dwarves but humans and gnomes bore me to tears. Humans because they're soo vanilla (which is understandable, but boring), and gnomes because they're so one-note (every single gnome is a mad tinkerer.. gets old. Why are there gnome rogue/warrior playable characters but basically every gnome NPC in the game is the same tinkerer stereotype)
---
The last major vanilla private server (the last Light's Hope server) was completely alliance-dominated as well. All of the major guilds decided to roll alliance before it even opened because holy paladins make clearing PvE content so much easier thanks to their mana-efficient healing and threat debuff, and Blessing of Freedom makes them overpowered in organized PvP premades. All of the tryhards are undoubtedly going to roll alliance in Classic as well.
---
I would note: if you are arms specced, the opportunity cost of switching to a sword and board are tiny. Not only is it easy to get a 1 hander to swing (shamans don't want 1 handers, most paladins don't, and rogues/druids cannot use axes). But also, the rage generation from anger management is independent of weapon, unlike unbridled wrath (which also happens to be much worse than anger management for any non dual wielding setup). 
---
So if you want to tank as 2h arms, just bring a shield, and if you feel too squishy, you can switch to it. or if you are nervous about being underleveled and undergeared (which is when you should be running instances anyways, when the drops are super relevant to you), you can just start with sword and board. 
---
Really, healers are so used to dealing with bad tanks, it's often just much better to not make everyone nervous with stuff they have not seen work well before. If people expect a shield, give them a shield.
---
Isn't there a druid trainer in stormwind?
---
This obviously varies a lot between realms and players. The reason I don't play Alliance is they're the aggressors lore wise in vanilla, the only people in the Horde wanting to actively harm the Alliance in vanilla are the Forsaken, and even then no one else in the Horde is aware of it and their plague is still super early in development, the Alliance just hates them because they're xenophobic religious zealots, same with every other Horde race. Like come on guys, you seriously haven't realized by now that the Orcs are acting differently than when they were blood cursed?

It's just completely wrong.

I feel that, I think phase 1 will be a minimum of three months though, and it’s the best time and staging ground to get your character up to snuff. MC is easy in hindsight but my guild back in the day took 4 hours or more to clear it. Not everyone is gonna be a minmax all star, and as small as the gap is in retail between noob and pro, I think will widen incredibly in vanilla.
---
I don’t like to compare private servers to blizzard but if we have to there are things on private servers that don’t add up, the numbers aren’t all right and I think there will be a meta shift in official classic.
---
ty
---
But more DoTs...
---
No it was 1 lock 3 priests
---
that would be a rarity, at least IMO. Armor usually looks best on tauren than any other race because of how huge it is
---
It's not hard. I knew from the moment they announced Classic that I'd play a holy paladin! Why would I play anything else? It's what I've been all these years!
---
Then my friends all voted to play horde... Now I am a lost soul. Set adrift among strange races and classes I've never known. Will I be a priest? It's sort of like a paladin...right?? Or perhaps one of those Shamans, that's the horde counterpart, isn't it? Oh to hell with it all! I might as well play DPS! Why not mage or warlock?? I don't know who I am anymore. Light save me.
---
Just seems odd that chinese gold would be that expensive.  Has chinese wages increased that much relative to murica?  lol
---
Sounds like I was mistaken and it is just 15/mo with no initial purchase. 15/mo is what it cost 10 years ago too. It's very common for an MMO to have a subscribe to play model from 8-15 a month. It keeps p2w away, which I've seen in almost every b2p or f2p mmo I've played.
---
Amazing DPS, a great buff, free food and drink for the whole group and the best CC in the game. You will very easily get all the groups you want.
---
yes.
---
I dunno, shapeshifting is pretty damn cool. It's the biggest draw that Druid has, other than people who like the "tranquil healing" flavor. It's just a shame that Druid is kind of meh in Vanilla.
---
I’m retired and my wife also plays wow so that’s how I have time to play. Im sure there are plenty of wow players that are out of shape but there are plenty that can play and also find an hour to workout or who play and have physically demanding jobs. I have some friends irl but more in the game and I’m happy with that. Much prefer to help someone kill a boss then help someone move. Also many people post pictures of real nice computer setups in nice houses so I think many people have nice jobs, degrees, or budgeting skills. Your comment sounds really insulting. 
---
  Also who needs all those things you mention when you have a lot of gold and a sweet mount.
---
No, it was introduced in TBC. Blizzard used to manually change spawn rates on certain things over the course of Vanilla, but there never was a proximity based dynamic spawning system. Questing off-hours was a real thing for that reason.
---
Lightspeeeeed!
---
ha! Coheed doesn't give me specific WoW feels, but they are my favorite band so upvoting for that.
---
Your comment is bullshit, also wrong.
---
Oh,  don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me...
---
Thank you! The humor is the trickiest part for sure. Always worried it won't be funny. It's good to hear people liked it.
---
&gt;It is not to remove server queues as this can be done more simply by adding additional realms.
---
It is, theyre said it in interviews. They want to be careful with adding realms, as they did add 2 many realms back in 2004 resulting in many dead realms today.
---
Circa Survive is GREAT chilling leveling music. Thanks for reminding me this bad exists.
---
No Druid trainer in SW but you can just teleport to Moonglade from level 10 and hearth back to where you were levelling.
---
I don't think this has ever been the case and I don't like your chances of Blizzard suddenly changing their stance on anyone who wants to maintain payment for multiple accounts.
---
Yeah. There are a few people who hate hamstring kiting (I am not one of them), That try to advocate for dual wield fury, but the hole you build by taking the first 3 tiers of fury talents (basically 5 points in cruelty and then like 6 more completely wasted points) is just too hard to make up, even forgetting that arms is far better in pvp and for tanking. And I personally like hamstring kiting.
---
There's no point to running Arms instead of Fury 2h in raids. You trade in Sweeping Strikes/MS/weapon spec for Bloodthirst/Flurry/Death Wish. Death Wish is a pretty strong cooldown and Flurry is just insane. More attack speed means more rage generation, which in turns means more abilities to proc Flurry. And since you're running 2H, the Flurry procs from abilities will be a more significant contribution to Flurry's uptime as you don't have an offhand eating up Flurry.
---
Oh and there's also Slam spec, but I'm completely clueless about that.
---
The week in AQ40 progression our resident Arms warrior switched to Fury, he went from ~15-20th on the meters to fifth place. It's purely anecdotal evidence but it really reinforces my belief that Fury is more than "just a little" better than Arms.
---
You're so cute thinking it was always like this.
---
not worth looking at anyway
---
Pserver, no bug report option on screen
---
You are several weeks late on this
---
Once a year I see a Gnome Hunter and I make a wish.
---
Anyone who's on the fence about druid, one thing to remember is if there are only two druids in your raid, then ALL the druid gear goes to those two.
---
Druids get full Tier 1 and 2 extremely fast due to their extreme lack of competition
---
Asking blizzard not to fuck up a launch is like asking white people not to sing along to don't stop believing.
---
So just a video of windfury procs and no actual PVP.  
---
Gotcha.
---
It's crazy meeting people in real life who wanna get into a fight about it. I rolled Horde 'cause me friends rolled Horde. I also rolled a pvp server for the same reason (which I will never go back to; I hate getting ganked). Now, I will miss my cow, but after dabbling on an alliance alt over the years, I have come to the conclusion that WoW designers spent 50% more love working on the Alliance. That, and I hate faction grinding with such a passion that I would rather give up my crazy awesome cow with moose ears to play a white bread human with Diplomacy. And holy shit sword spec. And better quests. And never again bind in Kargath.
---
You can play whatever bullshit you want, you ain't getting in my group.
---
Can you educate me on why dagger warriors are good? Is this just a meme or for real? I've never heard of it before, either way.
---
This isn't a joke, people. Well, it is and it isn't.
---
I've seen a few "Saturday Morning Cartoon" guilds. 7/9am raid start times.
---
I kinda want one myself. My wife and kid sleep in on weekends until noon, an early raid guild would be quite nice.
---
i am fully aware the vanilla launch was chaotic, they described it as fire and burning, im not acting anything about that.  
---
But the standards of releasing a game in 2019 is different than in 2004. Their solution back then was to create additional servers based on demand, their solution now is layering
---
Can’t wait for them to say fuck BC... Vanilla forever!
---
Hi, /u/objectivedirections

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cagq4s/does_anyone_mind_doing_a_rundown_on_how_melee/). 
---
Fucking retard
---
I imagine a lot of people posting here are migrants from private server subreddits. Don't let them bother you too much.
---
Blizzard never said that Classic should represent the roots of WoW. They said (paraphrasing) that it will represent the most complete version of Vanilla Wow. In their eyes, 1.12 is the most complete version.
---
Well, *you* try maintaining your figure after giving birth to the Centaur race!
---
Says the guy who is literally crowing about how a game is going to fail that people are super excited to play.
---
Nah you're just a dick and I hope you choke on your self righteous attitude.
---
Mix of both actually. Geuss a little bit more PvE
---
You slow them but they can also slow you. You don't close the gap. Warriors get charge/intercept which not only hard CCs their target but also dashes to them.
---
Retrowow
---
Silverpine sure. Hillsbrad and Arathi pass. Also fuck having to make the run to Badlands. Different strokes, though.
---
But man, Westfall and Redridge were some seriously well designed zones.
---
Keep an alt parked at the AH looking to snipe out Pendulum of Doom.
---
&gt;This is a question about **Bank alts**.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;1. What, if any, is the best class to make a bank alt?
---
&gt;2. What other profession, besides enchanting, is best to take?
---
&gt;3. Thunderbluff and Ironforge are the best cities. Any other tips?
---
1. Mage or hunter. Movement skills, plus mage teleport to various cities, allows them both to be great bank alts. I prefer mage due to enchanting. Hunters have to pay for ammo, which will reduce the efficiency of the bank alts purpose. 
---
2. Jewelcrafting, and before someone suggests tailoring, those early supplies should go to a cloth main if you're planning on making one. Jewelcrafting allows another mining/BS character to offload gems to the bank alt. And some things made through jewelcrafting can be disenchanted. 
---
3. Stormwind is also a popular place, due to the amount of wpvp raids that occur in westfall. Easier to jump in so to speak for a fun distraction.
---
Yeah it seems like the best option. I think I'll end up going tauren, but it would be cool to be a snowflake troll
---
Look, I know layering is bullshit, but it's the best way to handle the traffic on server sizes.
---
Imagine the lifespan of WoW Classic is that amazing 2 hour porn.  How many people would make it through the first 10 minutes, finish, and be too bored to continue?  Same thing here.  They want to keep the servers to a minimum, and yes Layering ruins a lot of things, but I think opening 400 servers for a few months would be just as shitty.
---
Those of us who were preteens when it came out are close to 30 now.
---
My post, the one your commenting on did.
---
Opposite issue.
---
TB's a really nice spot for a bank alt, but yeah everything looks the same at first.
---
Your legs leave your head behind
---
Yes
---
Blame it on damage meters. Any well oiled group you had that had no wipes, you post the damage meters then all hell breaks lose. Some rogue who wants to be at the top starts attacking a fresh mob off the skirts and suddenly he pulled 2 groups and is running to your group and then you all wipe.
---
I remember getting swiftmend and feeling like a god lol.
---
How is this system more simple than EPGP which has been around for almost 15 years?
---
I say Orc warlock. I love the lore of warlocks within the context of modern orc society, given the role they played in the formation of the original Horde that was under the control of The Burning Legion. 
---
Plus warlocks are such a cool class to play with all the demons you can summon, Voidwalker especially helps with leveling because you can use it for light tanking purposes (and sacrificing them for those boosts!). You got summons and soulstones/spellstones for utility purposes, great DoT's/debuffs, good DPS potential and absolutely SICK gear sets. Great for PvP or PvE. 
---
Orcs have such a rich and awesome backstory, wonderful culture, great aesthetics. Pure HORDE at its finest. 
---
If not that, Forsaken Wizard is great too. The undead have such a fascinating story and I love the themes they evoke. Like, they were forcibly ripped from their normal lives and twisted into horrific abominations made to kill and conquer the land they once called home in the name of an all powerful slavemaster who has warped their mind beyond ability to reason. They only feel hunger, an alien monstrous desire to consume. 
---
Then they are able to, through great force of will, break free. Some are forced to confront all the terrible atrocities they have committed, things that would make the most resolute warrior's stomach churn with disgust. All that guilt, all that pain. 
---
And some were so altered and damaged they don't even have that, as they can not recall who they even were. Undeath is all they know now. Either way, forced to somehow try to justify their existence, find a way to not crumble apart at the horror of what they've done and what they've become. 
---
Their bodies twisted into hideous mockeries of what they once were, rotting away in diseased monstrous forms that they cannot escape. Their minds fucked with beyond reason by dark magics. Their sensations dulled, their spirits withered. 
---
And the entire world is trying to kill them. Their friends and families either run from them in abject horror or try to kill them in disgusted rage. Their nations have abandoned them and there seems to be no empathy from anyone. Reviled as monsters, as freaks for something they never chose. Isolated and assaulted from all sides. 
---
And then trying to find common purpose together. To stand by one another's side and make a place for themselves in a world that hates them so. Barely managing to forge an alliance with those who once would have been their enemies, struggling to survive. 
---
Heh, I really like the Forsaken if you can't tell. I'm rolling Forsaken Warlock myself when classic releases.
---
Your kid sleeps until noon? What’s your secret? Mine seem to get up earlier and earlier and are getting too heavy for it to be cute to be jumped on
---
That's my problem too. Horde races are so much more *dynamic* versus the standard fantasy races on alliance. They also get some badass pvp racials, but they get shortchanged on basically everything else in design. Also from a few comments on here, people are saying that people who play Alliance are nicer. I want to take that with a grain of salt, but...I mean horde did have a *lot* of assholes.
---
/spit
---
Found the retailer. Get em boys!
---
This level of min/maxing is not something most players will ever be affected by or even notice. There will always be human error in your rotation, position, etc... as well as moving to avoid mechanics.
---
At a training dummy, with perfect execution, someone might do an insignificant amount more damage than you, but in the world or a raid, it's completely negligible.
---
Im replying to your comments cry baby. 
---
Get a girlfriend yet or you still lonely and fat?
---
nicely done, well laid out. Fishing isn't always the best way to lvl cooking but it's another useful document going into my "Classic" folder
---
We don't work for blizzard and blizzard hasn't said anything... relax, we are 5 weeks away from name reservations and 7 from launch.
---
Every time I finally stick with one idea somebody changes my mind.
---
-I‘m gonna play a gnome warlock because mount at 40 is free and so I can spend my money on professions!
---
- mount is only free because you have to spend so much money on pet spells at lvl 60!
---
-okay I‘m gonna play a warrior so I always find a group as a tank for easy life at 60!
---
- did you think about deff cap, repair bills and no way to grind mobs as deff warri?
---
-okay I made up my mind! Mage it is!
---
-this is the most played class you have to compete with 3000000 mages who have more time than you do and they will be better!
---
-haha got it! Holy pala for groups and nice plate armor!
---
-actually it is rly boring to play pala because you have to buff 24/7 and don‘t even think about plate you will wear robes until tier 2 at least.
---
-you know what. It‘s a priest! A god damn dwarf priest for god sakes!
---
-...are you sure you have enough time to learn how to proper downrank your spells?
---
Aaaaaarghhh!!
---
That west coast timing is why I'm starting my own guild. All my old wow buddies are dead set on raiding 8 eastern, and it's just not doable for most of us on the west coast anymore.
---
Fuck yeah Voltron Tier!
---
I thought it was just 3 characters total.  On the last stress test people were creating characters and were locked at 3 for awhile I believe.  When they were shutting down some of the stress servers to get more people onto one people couldn't create more characters if they had 3 already on a previous.
---
She's 18 months old.
---
Ever since 6/8 weeks or so, she's slept full nights. I've gotten full nights sleep pretty much every night of her life.
---
The normal weekend now is bed by 8, awake at 10 or noon. (I'm up at 7 or 8 like usual)
---
So we're having ONE kid. She's perfect. Next kid can't measure up, so not gonna happen.
---
This isn’t true because the mage wasn’t moving so leeway wasn’t activated.  This was just latency.  On the mages screen the rogue was a couple MS behind where he actually was.
---
Choose the one that you like the looks of above all else. You will be staring at that character for... days...
---
I live in constant fear of the clothadin
---
I’ve not been following updates for the past month and I’m curious hence asking the question. ICYMI most of the discussions here are around things we don’t actually know and seeking a discussion with others to either confirm (based on facts) or theorise (based on ideas).
---
What about my post makes you think I need to relax? Because I’m asking questions? Is this not ok in your view? 
---
Really odd response mate :/
---
I hope you find that. Using your brain in classic in dungeons means remembering where the hell you are going. It is way too easy to get lost in any of the endgame dungeons except stratholm, it means being aware of your threat. Pulling aggro is more than a split second inconvenience it can cause a wipe. It means making sure you don’t accidentally break cc. I don’t really know if you can compare the two. When I did m+ it just meant follow the tank and blow cooldowns and rush. In classic you take your time and do things right.
---
What add-ons will be usable in classic? Can I run omen/dmg metres?
---
Ah that does make sense, and if they had that limit in place then my theory of how it’ll work is probably gonna be right. 
---
Thanks for the info!

All depends what you meant by morning and what coast you're on.
---
Australia isn't going to work for a west-coaster unless you find a late-night raiding guild, but if your morning is late enough, an eastern European guild could work.
---
Likewise, Europe isn't going to work for an east-coaster unless you find a daytime raiding guild, but if your morning is early enough, an Oceania guild could work.
---
You might also be able to find an NA guild with a similar work schedule to yours.
---
Keep in mind that unless you find a European guild playing on NA/Oceania realms, you'll need a separate subscription.
---
Couple reasons. First, This allows the person who is actually tracking the DKP to only focus on what gets posted in raid. Second, it keeps any questions of DKP fixing etc at bay. And 3rd, by splitting different jobs up amongst multiple people it keeps any one person from feeling overwhelmed with too much responsibility. People that arent hardcore tend to get burned out if forced to be responsible for too many things imo
---
AFAIK it’s 3 characters across all servers, all servers that will be in launch will be named beforehand so guilds can choose which server they want so you can grab your names.
---
Sad as it might sound, I’m early 30s - and all standard life milestones aside (first born child, buying a house, travelling), playing WoW back in the day and raiding were some of the “best” times of my life.
---
I know it won’t quite be the same and I’ll not be able to play anywhere near as much as I’d like.... but I can’t *wait* to get stuck in again and relive it all
---
When I first heard about the concept of Mythic+ dungeons I was really excited.  Finally, consistently difficult 5-player content with good rewards, right?
---
But because it's timer-based it's just a mad dash to the end as quickly as possible, which is the opposite of what I enjoyed about difficult dungeons in the past.
---
I mean HS is a shit ability I agree, but what else do you use rage on after battle shout, rend, and hamstring? Does Tclap come out better damage per rage on single target when you take into account that HS removes the rage gain from a strike?
---
&gt; Tier 2.5 is basically offspec gear. 
---
Hey! For feral druids, it was the only main spec set :(
---
Dwarf and Gnome pvp racials are pretty damn good. In fact I would argue that stoneform is often more useful that Will of the Forsaken,  especially as a rogue (removes bleeds to restealth, removes blind, etc). 
---
It's hard to argue with orc stun resist tho.
---
I really hope I look like that...
---
The game doesn't work with layering at all. It goes completely against everything classic wow is. 
---
But look, we got sharding anyway. 
---
That's the problem. We wanted the 15 year old game. Instead, we got the retail lobby game with 15 year old graphics.
---
You are asking questions that have zero ability to be tested, "will we go to character create and just not be able to log in" ... not knowing something and asking a question is great!
---
Asking a question to predict a future when we aren't blizzard employees doesn't make sense.
---
And yuppers, relax - you'll have your answer either the day of name reservations or the day before :)
---
Realistically, at least Tier 2.5 matches. [What you'll actaully look like](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/238356799_jy85z/0/2100x20000/238356799_jy85z-2100x20000.jpg)
---
I'd rather be in a guild of laid back people with not great skill that takes a while to progress than deal with the migraine inducing neuroticism of the try hard crowd.
---
feral was so bad at tanking for a while in vanilla
---
&gt;That's the problem. We wanted the 15 year old game. Instead, we got the retail lobby game with 15 year old graphics.
---
Don't play it until layering is removed then... problem solved.
---
&gt;She’s 18 months old
---
That makes sense now. My sweet summer child, you have no idea what’s about to happen to you.
---
My advice is to have another one ASAP then they can keep each other company and you won’t need to wear a cup to bed
---
There is a lot of questions that have zero ability to be tested. Are you posting on all of them? Lol
---
Nah mate I’m all good, I’ll keep asking questions to things I’m curious about. Feel free to keep telling me what to do though!
---
Undead Priest, Orc Shaman. That's what I'd go for anyway.
---
Level as a holy priest.
---
Isn't there a guy in the park?  Its pretty much the only reason why that wing of  SW exists.
---
When the fuck did I say it was always like this?
---
Sitting on totems with mounts etc
---
I thought it was widespread that people use tab to target? The startattack part is really important for melee though
---
Good that you really only have one playable race as a paladin humans. Because let us be honest no one will chose a dwarf /s
---
probably
---
hey that reminds me, we got our gnome MT Quel'Serrar. So small you couldn't see it. talk about a waste of time
---
I believe you can do it with something like:  
---
/cast [harm][@targettarget]Smite  
---
but not sure.
---
No, I frapsed this on Gilneas EU.
---
The encounter had started when I arrived, so I could not actually enter the lair. But then the raid wiped and I ran in to find her like this and was in awe. By the time we started the second, successful attempt, she had gone back to sleep.
---
There’s plenty of full fights in the video, with windfury procs edited to music for your enjoyment
---
I know I'll play rogue, my dilemma is on the race.
---
Night elf for nostalgia to remake my original character or human because it's just flat out better in PvE (going sword spec and I take raiding very seriously).
---
This will greatly damage the game, community, and economy. It will not be able to recover from it.
---
There's no point in playing classic wow after it has been poisoned by any form of sharding, no matter what word they call it to pull the wool over people's eyes. 
---
People wanted classic wow for the community that forms on a single server. You can't do that when you're never with the same people twice.

Sharding completely destroys the server. When it was announced Ion *literally* said "We know you don't want this and it goes against the entire concept of the server."
---
Know what his next sentence was though? Pulled straight out of the retail playbook: "Fuck you, were doing it anyway."
---
So fuck that.

Idk man I have 'nam flashback of DKs jumping me and ripping a new one.

They [confirmed Oceania realms hosted in Sydney last week](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/oceanic-wow-classic-realms/216087). Just ping this IP during your normal play hours to figure out your likely latency: 103.4.115.248

My mind is telling me undead priest, but my body.. my body is telling me orc shaman
---
Oh, I have no doubt that Druid will be among the most popular classes below lvl 20. Particularly, the folks you mentioned in #2 are the least likely to make it to 60.
---
Another thing you'll want to keep in mind is that often a guild that advertises a 7pm start time is aiming for the first pull of the raid to be at 7pm.
---
Which means typically raiders will log in an hour or so before the scheduled start time to invite people, organize groups, start a Dire Maul run, get Songflower, pop Head/Heart etc.
---
So raiding with a guild that starts at 7am might mean making breakfast at 5:30 for a 6 o'clock raid invite.

There will be OCE servers

Probably because most people are shit at everything that requires effort when drunk and the fact that most drunk people are not very fun to interact with when you are sober.
---
&gt;This will greatly damage the game, community, and economy. It will not be able to recover from it.

Wrong - blizzard operates video games for decades, but you're right. 🤔

Decision was made the day Ion said "we know this isn't what anyone wants but it makes my job easier so fuck you, you're getting sharding."

The fact that everyone praises the devs for this turn of events is just baffling. It stinks of Stockholm syndrome.

the other priests might be a little peeved that you don't have spirit buff but you should be fine

Good one... enjoy whatever you plan on doing August 26/27!
---
... oh wait you'll be playing classic because nothing you are complaining about matters.
---
Don't listen to this mage or warlock player. He's just greedy for your power infusion. Make the right choice and make your healing meters higher by going holy
---
&gt;I have to assume that's what you mean because how they operate in PvP is quite hybrid-y.
---
You could also assume there's another option you can't think of, although this subreddit seems to be a safe haven for people who can't imagine their own fallibility and like starting fights about it.
---
&gt; The other builds, full holy/dedicated healing and full ret are too pigeonholed into their respective specs and they're quite maladaptive for an otherwise extremely versatile class. 
---
I was just agreeing with this statement and the whole "paladins have to choose between swinging and casting" thing.
---
What it really comes down to is the MS debuff is OP
---
It's good to know that the game means so much to you. If you want someone to play with once it all launches, I can DM you my Battletag. Either way, hope you have fun!
---
Enjoying the old Barrens at dusk.
---
I will just play UD rogue... Because fuck everyone.
---
My fondest memories were messing with my rogue in bc.
---
Couldn’t even get 5 people together for blood furnace. So I decided to tank, we sapped and  sheeped and stunned our way to a full 4 man clear with a rogue tank.
---
It was super fun. I’ll never forget it.
---
I find it quite often that those that write "Unpopular Opinion" usually follow it up with a quite popular opinion.
---
"I am my character"
---
I mean if that's not roleplaying I don't know what is
---
It's not so bad. I played on a PS as a feral, and even if the class was severely lacking (I want my mangle and my lacerate!), it was still fun and enjoyable experience.
---
Ditto.
---
Although I have Numpad 0 as my panic slam macro to unequip my weapon/shield when I know I'm gonna die.
---
I will also play rogue. I just dont know if it Will be UD, ORC or GNOME... I just want to shit on all those UD mages So I think I will go as gnome with mage killing improoved sprint build.
---
I've played a good bit of both, and I think the whole "horde is better at pvp" or "alliance is nicer" is just grass-is-greener syndrome, I've never noticed a difference on either side. People are people.
---
@ your first comment.. yep. I guess horde has a few things here and there, like the zepps being slightly better than boats, but yeah most things seem to be more catered to alliance.
---
Anyone have an idea if we will need a subscription to do this? Or can we just log onto the client without one?
---
200, sure. But 300? Forget about it.
---
Why is warlock so much higher on the horde side?
---
A spelldmg paladin or smite priest would. But as holy wrath items are pretty rare, it's unlikely anyone would farm them specifically. But for slots like bracers a holy wrath item would be supreme for quite a while.
---
The lightforged blade is a pretty good weapon for paladins around lvl 50, but it's not that easy to justify, espeically, if you plan on raiding as holy, as that ring can easily last you into raids. Also likely unavailable in phase 1. 
---
Nature's embrace is pretty low level and is outperformed by most higher level robes.

Also based on this post, I wouldn't assume a gender, but that's just me! I wish I was a mage in real life, too.

Above 180 latency consider playing a caster. Melee suffer hard with lag.

Friend raided on dial up. Rerolled to a mage due to lag.

Keep hard charging brother! I hope everything works out

Gnome rogue
---
I guess on some level,  but it’s not just me,
---
Everyone who plays classic will be their character.
---
You might have 1 alt, but having a notable alt will be rare. So essentially your existence in classic will be tied to 1 character everyone knows and you will likely play 90% of the time.
---
stfu fake ass Dr. Phil
---
Oh, I get what you mean.. but shamans have the same problem, really, it's just not as pronounced. Your swing timer resets when you heal with anything other than a Nature's Swiftness heal, unless you're counting healing stream totem in which case Judgement of Light is a decent equivalent. So yeah, shamans have a better talented instant-cast heal option than paladins, I'll definitely give you that, I just don't see how that voids paladins as a "true hybrid" though.
---
It's the same for offensive spells too, really. They have to choose between cast time spells and auto attacks. They have some instant-cast spells but it's basically just shocks and the few totems that do damage. It's not like paladins are absolutely 100% auto attack/seal damage either. But just like Nature's Swiftness-heals, their instants aren't as good because their hybrid-y strengths lie elsewhere.
---
Didn't intend for anything to sound confrontational, btw.
---
It's not. Warlock is just much lower on the Alliance side because the Undead racial ability, Will of the Forsaken, destroys their class in PVP.
---
Same with priests. Leveling them will be too slow for people and no big crit numbers, unless they are serious about healing.
---
I’ve had this one saved on my hard drive for years.  You can feel the guild emotion.
---
Have fun :)
---
Where u getting the mana to spam non stop for a boss fight in Naxx?
---
Well unfortunately it’s too late now. I will talk to them tomorrow. I have always been terrified of medication and want to seek natural remedies so I was hesitant to take them in the first place. When I started feeling awful I just wanted to feeling to end so I tapered off for a couple days and then quit. I have been mostly good on the anxiety front for the last couple months, my primary concern as been all this fatigue and pain I have been experiencing. You are right though I should have been in communication with the doctor more.
---
Perfectly said, I don't want it in anything beyond starter zones and westfall, darkshore, barrens etc
---
Pserver don't come without issues too.
---
Won't be wasting it on warlocks? You've never met the right warlock then
---
Now that I think about it, letting the user change the color schemes to their preference wouldn't take much effort at all. I'll look into it.
---
I finally managed to settle on Warlock. Now just have decide Human or Gnome.
---
Orc has the strongest racials, but if you prefer the looks of tauren, play one
---
Bet Shiq is a miserable person
---
Not even enough mana difference for a shadowbolt, about 0.3 crit... yeah...
---
That does not make you smart, putting 420 in your name is the exact opposite of smart
---
Yeh that's me too I patrol midnights until 6:20 est but I do have 3 days off since I work 12's. I would wangt to try to find a morning raiding guild too
---
Aside from the effort comments consider druid defensive cooldowns. Most melee have ways to save themselves or reduce damage. Druids utility doesn't keep them alive in unfortunate moments. Cat druids have a tough time always.
---
I cleared AQ40 and did some Naxx with ping in the 200s, it’s a disadvantage but you can do it.
---
I once entered a WSG against nothing but gnomes.  It was surreal.
---
nice!
---
BARELY worth it unfortunately
---
Yeah, you have to be really careful and ask lots of questions. Never just quit any medication, regardless of what you think it's doing. If you have concerns, make an appointment and discuss it.
---
When I was younger, I went on a couple medications, one of which had a serious sexual side effect. I'd just fallen in love, so I said, fuck it, I'm not taking this anymore. Two weeks later I was in the hospital having almost died because quitting the medication is a two month long titration process. I still have scars from the rash my body produced from suddenly lacking the medication like that. If it hadn't been for that rash and me going to the school clinic, I'd be dead.
---
The tooltip API is hosted by classicDB, so if they have some kind of maintenance break it's going to 404. I haven't noticed it causing other than console errors so I'll look into hosting it from somewhere else, thanks!
---
I like playing the good guys, so Alliance it is.
---
I mean, not everyone in classic just had one character, or just an extra alt, I had at least 5 characters on my alliance server alone, more on another server for horde. I won't be my character but I will play the character I make, lol. The only attachments I made with my character was the need to stick with it due to vanity items that I didn't want to spend more time getting on my alts. 
---
Some of my twinks had comparable playtime as one of my mains, everyone plays for their own reasons. I sure won't just have one character, though.
---
Hello tbc
---
Why isn't it taking into account mage teleport rather than just mage portals?
---
I hate hunchback trolls and orcs. Undead are a shit stain. Tauren, eh, no beef with the Tauren really. But fuck the forsaken and their stupid giggling.
---
Priests are one of the most efficient classes to level when played correctly.
---
Keep going on mate! I hope I'll have a chance to play with you!
---
Undead can gank you and then eat you for ultimate win though. 
---
Also headbang.
---
Get to STV that first Sunday and become a legend, server first fishing champion!
---
Reminded me of a tramp stamp.
---
Unpopular opinion but I think you might be right.
---
&gt; All classes in the game has at least one viable spec. 
---
Except Hunter. They're so worthless in raids, Blizzard had to make the first raid boss drop a spell book that only Hunters can learn and then sprinkle bosses throughout every raid for the rest of the game that can't be beaten without it.
---
&gt; The only thing that is stupid and long-lasting is your low IQ.

Ah the ol' "I have nothing of substance to offer, so I'm just going to attempt to insult you" gambit.

---
That’s because alliance is as PlAIN as vanilla! SHAME! (/s)
---
I'm fine with layering.
---
It's present and has been present in most MMOs and works, basically.
---
I'm not 20 and in college anymore, I'm working and have a family. My gaming time is too valuable to be spent waiting around in queue times or with another 100 players waiting for 2  boars to spawn.
---
Layering, when done properly, is perfectly fine.
---
And this is coming from someone who has spent most of his MMO life in contested zones (EQ, EQ2, etc.).
---
Also, Bliz said repeatedly that the layering is there for a fixed, short period.
---
Elegant solution to a serious problem.
---
I'm not racist against Humans, I just don't like Nazis and that's what they represent in Azeroth.
---
World buff exploit should take care of that.
---
Assuming i find enough friends to make a guild, i'll be doing a mix of EPGP points, with a mild amount of loot council to fill some of the flaws of a point system (namely limiting who can roll on BIS gear (no hunters stealing a BIS weapon cause they saved points) and for stuff like legendaries)
---
Nothing is higher resolution than the original, and this one has that stupid text overlay.
---
I have all the DLC:s but how do I play them? are they separate campaigns? Do you access them from your wartable/worldmap in skyhold?
---
Agreed. Pull 3 point from Imp Eviscerate and put into SnD.
---
Imp Kick is pretty funny in PvP as nobody expects it.
---
heh, 11 main heals as warriors in the 18k survey
---
Yeah. I play both and if I see the opposing faction, for some reason I get aggressive and attack every time. Except when it says "Level ??"
---
Concentrate and ask again
---
There is a sticky every Monday.
---
PALLY POOOOOWWWEEEEEERRRR!!! PC Dwarf master race. Filthy console human peasants.
---
1-2 hours a day, best thing is probably set up a regular play schedule with a group you can run dungeons with, if you're interested in that content. Otherwise you'll eat a huge chunk of time looking for a group.
---
Well, you do need a dwarf priest for Onyxia.
---
Because if I am unlucky I can't play with my friends for the entire leveling experience?
---
See I'm slightly leaning towards this idea too haha
---
Honestly, f what the pserver community likes and dislikes.  
---
Unless you're trying to raid 5 nights/week, then rolling a druid is a great idea. In vanilla, druids and warlocks completed their dungeons sets extremely fast because there were (natually) only 1-3 in each raid.  
---
One time, we invited a lvl 59 warlocks to MC because we just needed warlocks, and he left with 5/8 dreadmist.
---
idk wtf u r talking about
---
I second this. Layering in lower level zones is fine for a fixed period. The reason for layering is to compensate for the massive influx of players at the start, let it do just that and no more!
---
This topic is a troll.
---
I'm debating a human or gnome for warlock. Can't decide. Prefer gnome for racials and human for visuals.
---
Hitting a keybind is more reliable than right clicking a target, particularly if there is a large group of targets in front of you. Also allows the use of tab targeting. These reasons are why I believe its preferred.
---
Instant cast macro can be insanely good on the first for mob tagging purposes though!
---
No I'm not the author. I actually agreed with you on all your previous points, I don't have much experience with vanilla ret builds but even just looking at his builds for a few minutes a lot of the choices he made didn't make much sense to me.
---
Just google 'role-playing' mate. You'll get a good idea from that.
---
That's a super good point too actually
---
I used to be racist towards gnomes. Then I was hired as a chauffeur to a very talented gnome musician and we became friends. Then through the powers of love and friendship I became slightly less racist towards gnomes.
---
Tomorrow we want to do Zul’Gurub to start. Currently need 1-2 tanks (One warrior, and one cat who can also use bear would be nice), need a few healers, and plenty of DPS for ZG. We’d also ask that any DPS warriors bring a tank set to OT (We can spawn all gear for that).
---
This. The amount of emphasis on min/maxing is outrageous. I was raiding MC with a server third rag kill whilst wearing 50% greens, including a cowboy hat i thought was cool (rogue).  
---
Unless you are speed running some of this crap is really blown out of proportion.
---
Yes it has it's largest effect on threat. Do not let the crappy elite casuals of reddit persuade you other wise.
---
Ah... an armchair psychologist with the social skill of rotten plywood. Just what this man needed.
---
Actually 5-7 weeks doesn’t sound so bad, considering each week passes really fast, but a whole month seem to crawl by
---
You realize that layering doesn't save them money right?  If you have 2 servers or 2 layers that requires the same amount of servers.
---
Come on think people.
---
Someone did the math on a bis equipped WL for the int racial and it came down to not even enough mana for another shadowbolt and about \~0.3 crit. The escape artist racial might come in handy, it really depends. I am not the biggest fan of it, because of the niche. The spells it is actually helpful against can usually be reapplied effortlessly and don't forget that it has a cast time!  
---
Since I won't be tryharding as much as back in the days, I much prefer the human racial for rep grind. Stealth detection isn't useless either and the biggest point, as you have already mentioned: gnome visuals suck ass
---
Yeah its sad that these people don't get that 2 servers and 2 layers cost the same amount of money.
---
Human Leather Hat
---
Equip: You feel really comfy.
---
No offense, but maybe spend your valuable time elsewhere for two weeks, at which point queues and overpopulation won't be a problem regardless of layering? You know, rather than demanding QoL changes in what was supposed to be a recreation of a vanilla WoW?
---
Not sure why he’s downvoted, this is the only accurate answer. It varies depending on server ticks.

&gt;You combine two servers with their own completely unique experiences, events, and cultures can make for a disastrous experience for each end user.
---
Could a culture develop on a layered 100,000-person megaserver? What events will be remembered that happened on layer 3 that one day?  Aren't there limits to what kinds of experiences we can have when we log in with a different group of people every day? 
---
At least with Clusters you'd have some Segments that never need to be merged. You have a chance at a Vanilla-like experience and, worst case, your servers merge. But at least you had some time with the same server and not part of a mega server.

I'll be at the \~10-12hr/wk mark thanks to shift work and day-sleeping, but I also don't have any issues with 6mo to 60. This game isn't going to run off and leave me in the dust with a new xpac right around the time I get a couple toons leveled and ready for raiding. Finally. My plan is to level two, maybe three, toons PER faction. I really want to see both sides of the story unfold. I was exclusively ally until late WotLK, and completely missed a ton of Vanilla content because of it. Shame on me. Also, my wife is FINALLY going to play! So we're going to duo-level for a few hours per week during "family time" that will be in addition to my personal free time. Those couple of toons might take a year to level fully since family time is also used for dinner, chores, errands, home renovation, etc. Don't care, IT WILL BE A BLAST! \^\_\^
---
THANK YOU! Every fucking time someone says "you'll gear easily" I feel like people forget BIS was cloth, nobody wanted to give druids cloth, and everybody wanted all the agi leather.
---
Well i dont have beta access but on pservers rightclicking a mob starts melee auto attack. you need to manually activate auto shot to start shooting. you can start shooting by starting with a ranged attack spell such as serpent sting, but someone once calculated somewhere that serpent sting is not optimal (and also takes up a debuff slot) so its not part of the rotation. neither is arcane shot for the same reason.
---
So the optimal rotation is something like start auto shot manually, shoot once, cast aimed, shoot aimed, shoot another auto and shoot multi shot or something like that.
---
I used to play WoW from South Africa with 200ms+. Even as a tank I had no problems.  
---
The issue isn’t ping. At worst it’s barely noticeable and not a hinderance unless you’re into top tier PvP. The problems come when there is connection instability....that’s when sh1t goes sideways.
---
2? try 6-14 (because server crash and well...)
---
Hit and overcoming Dodge (and Party as tank) right?
---
I think any model changing that involved something that altered gameplay, say in raiding, could get you banned. But I don’t think this would count just the models of your characters or similar.
---
Uhhhh, technically that means shamans and paladins gear up faster, because shamans and paladins have more loot to choose from.
---
I can quote Garithos from memory. Does that qualify?
---
Ugh. Tauren look awful when they're not in dresses. Dresses ftw.
---
I have the LG one, it looks amazing. Sound quality is a bit naf but then who really uses that. I tend to play in the "game" mode as it makes everything pop a bit more, you cant really go wrong with it.
---
They expire on death. And they don't last the full Naxx run. You won't be able to do any meaningful progression with the buffs in Naxx. Sitll useful while they last.
---
Would you make any modifications to the melee start attack macro if you were trying to create a spammable tagging macro?
---
I think you missed the point of this post ;)

I suffered from 3rd stage depression and social anxiety and i can tell you, games didn't make it better, but this is just me. After i quit playing games 12-16 hours a day and started getting professional help and got right medication (i was on depression meds before but didn't help, stuck with those for like half a year) after that i got better.
---
Now i am studying again, have a girlfriend i have lived with for over 2 years and have a steady life and got back to school. I have learned to deal with my anxiety and panic attacks but still need to work with everything, sometimes i need sick leaves when worse stages hit me. But throwing everything for a game would probably suck me again into deep waters.
---
But if Classic helps your anxiety i am really happy for you, just don't get too into it and remember your mental health. When anxiety hits me i often open certain twitch stream and that helps me calm down. Ask someone outside of your head like your wife to look after you so you don't get too sucked and if she sees any changes in your mental health.
---
yes
---
Not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt, but do have a look into fibromyalgia. It's a very diffuse illness with sometimes very unrelated seeming symptoms. My colleague at work suffers from it and what you suffer from sounds rather very similar.
---
That's why I'm going to be a Nelf priest!
---
Thats not true at all. So many people played vanilla very casually and just had fun with it. 
---
The number of Raiders were the massive minority in vanilla and most people played the game for fun. 
---
But now here you are spinning a new tale to justify your need for victim-hood and e-drama. Caught ya in the lie.
---
When TBC hits, errrybody rolling paladin/shaman/druid. Those were the halcyon days.
---
You ain’t going shadow for pvp and holy for raids. You’ll be flat broke in no time.
---
What?
---
It's less about the GPU (any 10 or 20 series will work) and more about the monitor. Nvidia doesn't officially support all the Freesync monitors, so to know if they work, you have to dig through reviews or ask on places like /r/buildapc.
---
True for pvp servers. You could not send cross faction mail though. You needed two accounts to abuse the cross-faction auction house.
---
Warrior isnt rewarding to play unless A- you have a pocket healer 100% on you, B- you reach 60 and be geared C- you play on a PVE server
---
Or just play Warlock and never respec and enjoy no-respec PvP!
---
So I played mostly in TBC, where I loved druid. How much worse is it in vanilla? I loved healing in PvP with druid. But I guess lifebloom was a big part of that.
---
Oh really? I only ever played on PvP realms back in the day and never reflecting over it being different on PvE realms. My bad!
---
\- “Melee leeway” is working as intended. 
---
Thats what they said in a blue post regarding the "not a bug list".
---
I played vanilla wow in the 2004 beta and in retail from 2006 onwards and since 2012- to present day I've been playing on private vanilla servers. I can honestly say I've had just as much fun on private vanilla servers as I had back in retail vanilla. People who talk about rose-tinted glasses are dillusional. It really, 100% still is THE BEST version of WoW.
---
The only thing I can never really re-live is the very first experience of entering a new un-explored world that I got to do in 2004. Being able to walk the Ashenvale forest that I previously only had seen in the WC3 campaigns. Aside for that, gameplay wise it still shines.
---
I always thought it was a stupid decision. Much like no Blood Elf Warriors in BC.
---
You know how many pservers die real quick do to pop drop? A lot.
---
This is very different to having say 2 new vanilla servers open every year or so.  The pop drop is going to be giant as many will try it and drop it. Were as, for vanilla pservers even with their playerbase that knowns what vanilla is and want to play it still has issues unless its one of the big 2.
---
A layered Classic is not a Vanilla recreation. It's not what the original project mandate was. "Warts and all," they said. 
---
Well, a login queue on my preferred server is a wart and I'd be willing to either way to play there or go play on a different server until things calm down.
---
I'd be willing to play on a segment with a static population that shares a name pool with other segments and might eventually be merged.
---
I'd be willing to deal with a 15k population and dynamic respawns.
---
I'm debating if I'm willing to deal with layering. I've seen what it does to MMORPGS and it is fundamentally imcompatible with the notion of sharing a common experience with a group of people since, by design, it is a system designed to *separate players from a massive pool into smaller pools.* It seems like Blizzard has lost their way trying to add player convenience at the expense of the player experience (thus repeating the exact. same. mistake of the past).
---
Totally understand this as I mained a priest and getting Benediction was awesome!

You totally missed the best part though. That one dude in Method's pop quiz video didn't just say that Rag would die in a week, no, he said that Rag wouldn't be the longest-living end-of-raid boss again. Let that sink in. That means he thinks that either Nefarian, C'thun or Kel'thuzad are gonna outlive Ragnaros and take over a week to kill from their respective release.  
---
The very notion is fucking hilarious. He either confused himself or is completely deluded.
---
No. That is a really shitty site, even [the list from Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/) is better and that's only the *officially* supported monitors. Most FreeSync monitors not on that list work perfectly, just some don't. So you have to do your research.
---
That's fair, but with hack and slash games I play mages if possible, so no hacking or slashing. I would direct you to the goldshire Inn on Moon Guard, then compare it with any other realm. You'll have a deeper understanding then.
---
Play an aasimar who is infected by vamprisim, cursed with lycanthropy, and who has undergone ceromorphisis (and is thus also a mindflayer), that has performed the ritual to become a lich.
---
Play lock yourself and realize why
---
Vanishes on weapon swap
---
Voluntary character-copy is the best policy. That way people can stay with their vanilla character and keep raiding vanilla content, but at the same time try later expansions with the same character but on a new server.
---
Why warlocks? Warlocks only come online in terms of dps in Naxx.
---
At this point I'm convinced you're just trolling. 
---
It's a garbage spec, if a casual guild is willing to bring you more power to you. 
---
It's just... not good.

+1 on the 18k classicwow survey showing how RP-PvP is 3 times more anticipated than regular RP.
---
Give us RP-PvP!½
---
The main difference though is that unlike druids, a typical raid will have many more than just one or two paladins (there are six different blessings a raid wants iirc).
---
It is true though that Mail or Plate healing gear can only ever go to pally or shaman
---
I can personally confirm this, got on a MC raid as 57 just to curse bosses and soulstone healers
---
WoW delined basically in the same order the expansions has been released. Vanilla was the best version of WoW-period. TBC was an amazing successor but went downhill halfway thru when they started to introduce badge-system and too many catch-up mechanics. Wotlk was overall worse than TBC for the same reasons.
---
from the way the lore is progressing, i am thinking tauren or orc just to be of the same race as bad asses like trall/saurfang and baine ...
---
I narrowed it  down to hunter, warrior and shaman. It has to be something with physical attacks, I don't like casting spells. 
---
Tanking is the thing I enjoy the most but I am afraid of the responsibility that comes with it, it's like a full time job and I don't want to get back on that path again. So it's down to hunter or shaman: pets vs totems, I am not sure which is more fun.
---
You'll have more fun *playing* a warrior if you no-life it. 
---
It's still a strong class, and you'll constantly be in demand from 12-60. 
---
If you find another buddy (like a mage) then you can 3vPvP most other groups.
---
If Warlock could be your jam, you and your priest buddy could crush some raid content while buffing eachother.
---
tHe NeW oLd WoW
---
Yeah you could These people are funny.
---
You could even do it in areas like 3 zone groups or w/e there is no limit to how you divide it up. Now the idea behind layering was to not do this as to allow a 3k pop server and then another 1-3k pop server stacked on top of each other, with a  small pipe between them.
---
Its honestly a far more vanilla like experince than most would give it... its more than insta "dynamic" respawn monsters like pserver have (its easier to level on most high pop pservers than low pop ones) Their dynamic respawns rates are so insane you just kill a mob it repawns in 2-5 secs kill it it respawns , insta quest completion... its really fast and Not close to blizzlike.
---
Id take a pally over a shaman any day... Blessings&gt;Totems
---
I don't remember Vanilla WoW being unplayable due to how busy the servers were when I first started playing in February 2005, this would be the case with the volume of players that will be logging on. I'm okay with layering for the starting zones, though I have no doubt even with layering it'll be tough tagging mobs. Obviously this needs to be a temporary thing and layering is a case of less is more. 2 weeks into launch and level 10 should be where layering ends imo.
---
I recall this being true back in the day (making bags for mats + tip). 
---
And a lot of people will spend some time farming SMLib-Cath for boss drops that last a dozen levels.
---
Perfect class balance is detrimental to the core essence of any high-fantasy MMORPG. The thing that makes vanilla great is that very fact that not everyone is equal in all tasks. Each class and race complement the others in their shortcomings.
---
I'd do a separate alt for lvl 35 and give them tailor + alchemy for double transmutes.
---
Leave the pure bank alt on lvl 5 with enchanting.
---
Every decent guild is already practicing on their own private servers.  They aren't advertising any of the "big ones" which we all know what they are already unless you live under a rock.
---
Dude 3k people at launch will require the same stuff. Hello?
---
Jesus Christ
---
I cant stand horde races anymore, except trolls
---
Id be playing gnome if dwarf wasnt so awesome
---
What does PepeHands Mean??
---
The layers have separate generals as well
---
I tried to use it and can confirm that it's not great from a UX perspective.
---
Just use the wowdb or whatever other database and search for {slot} {levelrange x-y}. Been doing that while casually practicing level routes on a pserver and it's a fairly reliable way to find the stuff you might want.
---
Yeah, I meant it as it was an obvious miss from his build, like I don't understand how he doesn't have any lol.
---
&amp; yeah, it wasn't too bad in my testing but most of it was pvp as well testing. I can share that build if you wouldn't mind critiquing it. What is the deep ret build? The only build I ever see being mentioned as objectively good is the reckoning build.
---
Cause Ironforge is more cozy
---
I don‘t like hunter playstyle but right now I‘m thinking about it to avoid everything 😅

---
&gt;-okay I‘m gonna play a warrior so I always find a group as a tank for easy life at 60! - did you think about deff cap, repair bills and no way to grind mobs as deff warri?
---
A prot warrior cant kill stuff? :(
---
&gt;-you know what. It‘s a priest! A god damn dwarf priest for god sakes! -...are you sure you have enough time to learn how to proper downrank your spells?
---
Okay now youre being silly, a priest if any are the class you need to worry about killing stuff on your own, not downranking spells :P
---
None of us have mains and people are still talking about phase 6 raiding. Why is talking about twinks before launch so much more unacceptable to you?
---
No, I don't identify with the meshes and textures, that my graphics card draws on my screen. This is why I always rolled both factions over the years.
---
If you were, you wouldn't have made your original comment, you are a little bitch who is scared of private servers and thinks they are the devil, "kid".
---
Undead Warlock, for the animations.

I've got a 22 mo old and a cat, can confirm, a cup is needed. I still cup my hands over my balls by habit when I go to bed. That fucker cat still jumps onto the bed straight onto that area to this day.
---
I'd like to join.  Will most likely play a rogue but am willing to try something else if needed.  Do I need to do anything in particular to reserve a spot?
---
Yes I would have because it is the simplest form of the argument.
---
I won't be seeing any more of your comments. But good luck on your next GED exam, I'm sure you won't fail it this time! That assistant manager position at McDonald's has your name written all over it.
---
For non German speaker "Nagut" means roughly the same like : Ok/alrighty
---
Also the culling of Stratholme, and almost all the villains being alliance races:
---
Kelthuzad, Arthas, and most other  Scourge agents: humans
---
BRD bosses: Dwarves
---
Illidan, Nagas and whatnot: NEs
---
Gnomes are the only race out of guilt
---
40 is prime Scarlet Monastery grinding territory.
---
Adjusting Size, managing Buffs/debuffs, class colors, enemy cast bars etc. basic stuff all unitframes addon have
---
Make me. :P
---
Not in my experience, private server players are a bunch of garbage newbies.
---
"I don't want to join a guild" said no one ever that has a hardcore guild competing for a top world rag kill.  Get rekt.
---
I’m racist towards gnomes. They are priority kill when I PvP
---
I raided back in Vanilla with an average of 250-300ms with at times reaching ~400ms (Sydney Aus.)
---
I imagine your current ping to the US servers to be much better around the 100-150ms mark and also Oceanian servers have been confirmed
---
Gnomes don't deserve rights.
---
Something tells me you are more biased towards Vanilla than I am towards WotLK.
---
I dont think so. Everyone knows alliance have no souls. How can it be racist?
---
Make me horny.
---
blizz said you need sub
---
And that is how you get kicked.
---
Underwater nips.
---
On which polls is lock higher than mage??
---
You can but if you wanna grind money and farm stuff it‘s not that funny compared to warlock, hunter etc.
---
Priest was about downranking and my whole post was ment to be not that serious (:
---
Looks digital and sketched at the same time. nice work
---
&gt; that can't be bothered to read the rules of the community they're advertising in
---
The most intelligent race in their faction killed 90% of their population with radiation and in 15 years living right next door hasn't been able to fix it. Yeah, the Alliance are fucking morons.
---
Now that's an argument I simply cannot counter.
---
You what?
---
nobody but the top guilds are going to be smashing AQ40 or Naxx. You are seriously underestimating their difficulty.
---
Someone in a guild planning on a top world rag kill wouldn't ever bother saying something like that.  Dude is fake as fuck.
---
Fortunally it was an Raid with mostly my RL friends.^^  So they were parient and we killed him against all odds!^^
---
More of a classist if that's a thing. Hunters have always been my nemesis
---
Games aren't for having fun, they're for reinforcing my crumbling self esteem
---
Cake it's your  cake day. I want some cake
---
Not me! First I need to learn the abbreviations. So I have some steps to go.
---
I'm for layering, but I still hope they *do* remove it after a short while.
---
I understand your point of view, and I realise a unique experience will be lost because of layering, as well as an opportunity to make friends.
---
But dont I have to buff everyone in raids? As  aa ret Paladin I remenber raiding as running around and buffing
---
You misspelled priests that mind control.
---
A CONUNDRUM!!!
---
My family actually convinced me to give it a try and now I'm the most hyped person in the group and I hate them for it. I can't wait until 27th of August.
---
So yea, I don't do that, I just throw fireballs and I would do it in real life if I could. However, I'll never ask someone to call me Xxrunawayfromdad
---
Nothing has been announced, but highly unlikely as such a thing did not exist in original vanilla, and that has been their guiding philosophy.
---
I still remember my first reaction to leroy jenkins video was like "Wait did he say a paladin wanted devout shoulders? but theyre cloth?"
---
Since then i just feel so bad for paladins.
---
All races can be warriors in Vanilla.
---
No
---
Did you ever eat fried chicken with him in a car and get arrested by the guards in SW for fighting at an inn?
---
This is not an in-game addon and only works in your browser. Sorry.
---
Yeah because before word came out that his dad ran a fraudulent company, nobody ever gave Tipsout shit on this subreddit. /s
---
I mean, what's the point of this thread.
---
Anything built in the past 6-7 years of relevant hardware will run classic WoW over 144 fps in raids.  Are you *that* out of the loop?
---
No, everyone will have new characters
---
world pvp as rogue? you mean pickup random ppl here and there? if you mean massive battles rogues cant do anything...gl
---
lol this isn't some fucking competitor, anyone who posts something like this is clearly a more casual guild that doesn't know.  Wtf are you talking about.  "I'm going to get this casual guild in trouble on reddit by shitting on their recruitment post, Rag world first secured!"  lol get the fuck out of here.
---
It can be. It cannot be. To be or not to be.
---
interesting how warrior is the most popular class, yet tank was the least popular role.
---
the tier 2.5 looks bad ass
---
The only thing I dislike about warriors is that in large groups in wpvp you spend most of the time just looking at everybody else. At least with a rogue you can use stealth to pick somebody off and vanish. Not so with warriors.
---
wth are those random capitals
---
After naxx is on farm and everyone is pvping in bis 5wep skill is nothing. Nelf stealth underrated, I'd pick nelf if I rolled ally war on classic. Gnome pry better but kill me if I ever roll gnome pls.
---
&gt;But the standards of releasing a game in 2019 is different than in 2004
---
It's literally a game from 2004.  People demanded this game because Blizzard made so many trash changes for modern convenience that they ruined the game, and here you are telling those players "no, you're wrong, you want this change for modern convenience." You're basically saying, once again, "you think you do, but you don't".  We think we want this game to be released in a similar state as vanilla WoW in 2004, but we're just stupid idiots!  We really want convenience and layering!!!  We obviously want a modern game, not this silly game from 2004, with all it's flaws!
---
Sigh.
---
How can you group with friend that's already playing for some time? Tell him to relog?
---
How can you figure on what layer to use before logging? Require all friends to be battle-net friends and chat outside of the game before launching?
---
Also, the system can be abused about the same way. You can relog in seconds. And here you can choose between all availible layers, so loot a node (for example) multiple times (in contrast to current where you have to have friends in that layers).
---
Are you being ganked? relog to a different layer
---
I don't see this system as different to the current beta system. It is basically the same thing but with few unnecessary annoyances.
---
German mobile phone keyboard
---
So 100% Alliance Shaman is out (although I remember the totem quests being really fun). I don't like Druids thematically so they are out. 
---
I like Rogue in PVP, but can't stand them in PVE in combat, I like the pickpocketing thief side of them.
---
I haven't really liked Hunters very much, seemed boring to play while leveling, capturing rare pets was fun.
---
If there are any aoe spots open, Mage would be fun. I like their utility like portals and blink is one of my favorite spells. I don't like mage much in PVP though.
---
Now comes the classes that I am more heavily considering as a main.
---
Warrior is fun to tank dungeons with, but leveling is a pain until around whirlwind axe quest, the class is pretty fun after that. Pretty fun in PVP as well. I would want to go Gnome but the Human weapon bonus is shown to be insanely powerful.
---
Warlock is fun, I like DOTs, I like fear. Pets that can pretty heavily alter your gameplay based on which one you use. Best solo farmer out of my choices. I like Gnome so no conflicts with race here.
---
Priest has the Warlock benefits without the pets, and I would get to heal. My main class since late BC early Wrath when I started. I know priest very well. Can't stand Dwarf Priest.
---
Paladin is what I am currently leaning towards. Best lategame PVE and PVP healer. Can tank dungeons. I really want to try out Ret and a reflect build for aoe grinding. Not really set on race, leaning towards Dwarf but again, that weapon skill is just insane.
---
Not sure if Human rep bonus is pushing me away or drawing me towards playing as a Human. I want to get as many reps to exalted as possible but not sure if being Human diminishes that achievement...
---
Also trying to figure out what type of server to roll on. PVE is classic, and I feel will have a lot more new players over time where people might be scarred rolling on a PVP server that has been out for a while. PVP is where epic battles and stories are made, more exciting leveling. RP sounds fun, but I don't think I can get any of my friends to roll on one and I would guess there aren't as many top end guilds. RP-PVP seems like a PVP server with a tighter community and some respect between players, I would heavily consider this if they decide to actually make one.
---
Might get into professions later.
---
&gt; Just so you know, I literally have posts from you saying most guilds did LC and another guy swearing up and down most guilds did DKP back in Vanilla.
---
No, you don't.  I said "Back in vanilla all the top progression guilds went LC", "The most successful guilds back in vanilla were all LC", and "the most successful guilds did it [LC]."  Notice something in those quotes?
---
Most guilds in general did DKP.  Most guilds in general also sucked and never went anywhere raiding in vanilla (the number that ever killed anything in Naxx was painfully low).
---
Progression guilds that actually did get somewhere, that were the first to kill bosses and clear zones, were usually LC.  These guilds were a minority of all of them back in vanilla, though.  LC over DKP was just one of the aspects that helped these guilds surpass the rest.  As I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread it was because those guilds were all about the mission (clearing zones) over selfish, personal goals.  In the end, funny enough, those guilds also ended up getting more of the good gear to all their players because they cleared content more often then the rest of guilds.  
---
Crazy how focusing on the mission over personal gain helps everyone in the end.  Not too different than real life...
---
My advice for finding a class to play on retail or classic is always this:
---
1. What's my main goal for classic
---
   1. Raids (x)
---
   2. Wpvp (Rogue or Mage)
---
   3. Solo Content (Hunter)
---
   4. Everything (x)
---
2. Am I gonna play with a group of friends or do I need to make friends in game?
---
   1. Do I pick a class to fit my friends choices (x)
---
   2. Do I pick a class that's in high demand for a random guild I need to join? (Tank or Healer, maybe druid)
---
3. What role fits my playstyle the most?
---
   1. Defensive (Tank or Healer)
---
   2. Offensive (DPS)
---
   3. Both (Hybrid)
---
4. How much time can I spend on classic? 
---
   1. Not that much (Quick access to groups as Tank or Healer?)
---
   2. A lot (X)
---
5. What type of advantages fits me the most?
---
   1. The ability to move around fast (Druid - Hunter)
---
   2. The ability to get free mounts early (Paladin - Warlock)
---
   3. The option to pick my fights (Rogue as fuck)
---
   4. Quick long distant travels (Mage)
---
   5. High demand from others (Tank - Healer)
---
6. Do I favour esthetique or min/max?
---
   1. UD or NE for edgy 
---
   2. Dwarf or Orc for min/max
---
   3. Tauren or Gnome, because I'm a living meme?
---
7. Do I like brick walls or fugitive camps?
---
   1. Stormwind
---
   2. Orgrimmar
---
8. Am I actually good at the game
---
   1. Yes (X - hunter)
---
   2. No (Hunter)
---
Going through those 8 steps will narrow down your choices with quite an amount. If you still got a few classes to pick between, go through the steps with those in mind again. If still not sure, pick UD priest!   
---
Best regards!
---
Like you, I'd love to see layering go, but dynamic spawning isn't perfect either, there would be many ways to exploit it just as much as layering.
---
Remember that MC, onyxia and BWL forces mages to go Frost. 
---
Frost require gear while Warlocks can easily outdps any mages as destruction in BWL/MC.
---
And if the raid is carrying a Shadow Priest, even more.
---
However when mages are able to raid in fire like in AQ20 or Naxx, no warlock can outdps em.
---
100% against it.
---
If u dont want to cast spells, dont go shaman. In raids you are a totem-b1tch with heals. Eventually you might got your hands on a good  and have fun with windfury, but thats alot of totem casting and healing to get there..
---
I've been doing some low lvl dungeons as feral. My bear health as a tauren is around double what the average members' is and about 20-30% higher than other tanks. It's pretty crazy. But yeah, it's all about that utility. It's great being able to offtank in a 5 man when the tank dies and then just continue tanking where they left off. And the uniques you mentioned like tranquility make some of the hold off special skills easy to freely cast and save the day out of nowhere.
---
Layering could still be removed before launch. Don't throw in the towel for no reason.
---
"Objectively better", but you don't even understand why focusing more on specs than classes is a bad thing?
---
I thought I'd already made my choice with priest, but then I remembered totems and chain heal. Plus reading other people's shaman experiences -- as well as your post -- has me all nostalgic. And now I don't know whether I want to main-heal as a priest or shaman! ^Help ^me
---
Enya. I used to spend hours levelling and exploring the forest zones in Kalimdor listening to Enya. The music fit the atmosphere of the zones so well.
---
Does anyone else remember that old video of the female NE showing off GM commands on a private sever? Instant nostalgia whenever I hear those tracks playing.
---
I know wich i would rather face in a battleground tho.
---
I’m out travelling in Italy atm, flight in a few hours, but if you ping me tomorrow I have the source on my computer and would be happy to share.

Rogue would be the easiest to bind everything to a controller imo
---
It's not pride. It's nerdiness. It's way more powerful in the Horde, with the Alliance being more for "normies".
---
the big head on a tiny body looks silly but can i ask why you HATE them? Like its just a game character but some of the hate seems borderline unhealthy, like ppl hate midgets in real life too or something..
---
I believe the magic limit is 6 seconds.  
---
Don't engage for 6 seconds, and you can drink. Easy to do with a polymorph, Sap, or fear
---
But thanks to WF totems you'll probably still be lower on the threat list than your melee DPS. In the end it all balances out somehow.
---
It was a funny episode, but one thing the advent of streaming has done is completely belie the obesity jokes about dedicated players. Few top players are Hotted levels of out-of-shape and some (Sco, Venruki, Xaryu) are undeniably in great shape. Top wow players appear to be a very normally distributed cross-section of society, physically.
---
Ah, I see. Definitely not the case on the beta though:
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?faction=Horde&amp;maxLevel=40&amp;minLevel=35
---
It’s true and I love it. It makes me feel like I’m playing classic again :’)
---
Eh dude you should get a wireless keyboard and mouse specifically for raids. You'll just be slower than everyone else.
---
What's your proposed solution against it? I'd rather have layering than competing with 3000 people in the human starting zone.
---
Sleep is for the weak. When I was unemployed, I slept 12+ hours a day. Now that I work 8 hours a day, I sleep for under 5 hours. I still get to play almost as much as I used to
---
&gt; paladins gear up faster
---
Actually both the paladin tier 1 and tier 2 sets are pretty bad for healing. So the only useful items you'll want are needed by the other healing classes as well.
---
Except that it did exist in vanilla..
---
and hunters
---
Sure, I'd love to take a look at ideas and think about them.
---
Deep ret would be 11/9/31. Something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxzZVrZVbLtrcqo
---
It's quite similar to a pve ret build, but takes off some pve spec points (imp crusader, precision) to take more pvp oriented talents. You aren't relying on reck bombs and can do quite consistent burst damage. Compared to a ret/reck build, you mostly get repentance as an additional cc available to you as well as consecration for flag defense and rogue discovery and the pushback protection to get some heals through without divine shield. Though I'd say this build relies more on you having good gear than a reck bomb build.
---
Going 13/7/31 instead, compeltely foregoing precision and getting 2/3 healing light is also a viable option
---
Ok, sorry if I sounded rude :) I'll type smth helpful for you now.
---
I am not sure how to understand it.  
---
From the post it seems like you are asking for things like Molten Core 20man, where you progress through completly new own instance that is like easier version of MC, or BWL20, which would be... some new area with different bosses.  
---
Is that what you mean?  
---
Because the replies are automatically assuming that you want option to adjust existing raid to less players so I am not sure.
---
Cloth drops for everyone!
---
you're a special kind of retarded

Imagine actually being this stupid... holy shit

Can you enlighten me on how RP affects PvP?!

Nope I wont. And I am cetain about it. No amount of Frost armors and blocks will save them. Imp. Sprint, Imp. Kick, Preparation, Escape artist, ambush spec, they will fucking suffer.
---
Your not fixed though are you, once you log in and out you get assigned to a different layer again so there is no way of staying on the same one.
---
dont listen to them priest is hard, its the healer with most heals and most responsablilities.
---
if u want simple go paladin
---
AV is phase 3 so if you're planning on tryharding at all from launch Arcanite Reaper will be worth it unless you are lucky enough to see early BRE/Spinals drop AND you have the pull to get either weapon.
---
i have always been terrible at farming gold and have literally never had an epic mount in vanilla lol, maybe this is my time!
---
So one shouldn't add this to instant cast ranged attacks? Doesn't it only target the nearest enemy though?
---
They're just very different to level than anything in recent history has been. Unless you're the type to look up strats, it probably wouldn't be obvious that Spirit Tap and wanding things to death is the optimal way to level.
---
Comment for later

&gt; not doing direct damage or taking direct damage 
---
Any interaction will reset the timer, including applying non-damaging debuffs and CC

I still remember the feeling of seeing Orgrimmar for the first time in WoW after having played Rexxar's Warcraft 3 campaign. I was completely awestruck. Being a Tauren, Thunderbluff was the first city I saw, and while it's still my favorite city to this day, there was just that history behind Orgrimmar that made discovering it for the first time much more memorable.

Layering is active on beta but it'll be like 10 people on a layer because there are that little people playing.
---
Once blizzard announced they were done with the game essentially, I cried a little lol
---
Exactly! layers need to be FIXED untill the end of phase one untill they merge them.
---
The /s in your comment made you the snarky asshole AND the guy who explains jokes. Well done.
---
I actually LOVE T2.5

As someone who was a Vanilla Druid here are some more musings:
---
* The fantasy of "Druid" isn't as common across storytelling, most people who don't play D&amp;D or have read LOTR don't know what a "Druid" is, thus less play
---
* You don't get the animal forms straight away, it's level 30 before you even get your primary damage form. Again leading to less people committing to 60
---
* No out of combat Resurrection is seriously lame for the casual Druid trying to do 5 mans
---
Just in the assassination tree it seems weird to take 2/2 murder for 2% overall dmg over 3/5 imp poisons or 2/2 exposed armor. Have pvp specs in the past ever done that? Quick calculator math, you have to deal % 98.04 of their hp for murder to deal the other %1.96 of their hp. So a warrior with 6k hp is reduced to 5,882.4 hp. Murder dealt 117.6 dmg over the course of you dealing 5.882.4 dmg. Expose armor is used in sap - cheapshot - expose - ambush/cheapshot combos against armored targets in duels and possibly useful in group pvp, but if not you still have 4% higher poison proc chance. 1/25 attacks hitting an extra poison is equivalent to more dmg/advantage than 2% dmg is I reckon. Haven't even considered how much vile poisons would increase your damage overall either, especially with dispel resistance. But if you love seeing the biggest crits possible, stick with it.
---
Everything else seems good.
---
As for race, it depends on your plans for pvp to some extent, dwarf is more reliable in a group setting, gnome can be layered over as soon as you EscArtist. I have had times where on my gnome characters I break a nova right before being hit by a cone of cold and it nullifies the racial (they sometimes hold spells to layer back over it too). Dwarfs can also find treasure, you have to consider finding treasure as a means to an end here.
---
Damn. That's a hefty amount, but worth it never the less.
---
this is actually brilliant. reminds me of the ones done for destiny.
---
The idea can actually be expanded on if you are interested and have the time to make it a full character summary or tracker.
---
Something that shows current level, reputations, quests, gear, items in bag (dno if this one is possible), past activities and even a section for planing.
---
Getting ahead of myself here :P i'm just too excited for classic and your work added to it.
---
50 days to go!!!
---
After changing my mind 100 times, I've landed on Warrior. Help me pick a race plz.
---
Tauren
---
I like their size, Thunderbluff, stomp, herbalism/calm guy RP. I love their attack animation. I like how plate look on them. Longer AA attack range.
---
I dislike how they can get stuck in a doorway, or how they fill up the whole screen when backed into a wall. I dislike the codo. I dislike how they run - seems like they're soooo slow.
---
Orc:
---
Their size is easier to manage. Run animation is better than Tauren. I like the aggresive feel. Racials seems super powerful. I like that Org. feels like their home. Axe spec. is very cool.
---
Durotar seems so dry and hot. No trees. They seem kind of uncivilized. They are more bland than Tauren, and I guess a lot of people will go orc.
---
Please help... can't decide
---
Two reasons: 
---
1) Your only defence mechanism 'Fear' is countered by 30% of the enemy faction = Most Warlocks re-roll Horde
---
2) Identity, people who play Warlocks want to play the "Evil" character, they're not looking at Gnomes to fulfil that fantasy, but they are looking at Undead.
---
I hit everything I can with chain lightning.
---
But what if classic dies within few months?
---
The only reason there were no druids in Asmon's tournament was his last-minute change of plans (it was supposed to be Alliance-only) to add big streamers for views (who are mostly Horde). Note the lack of Shadow Priests as well. He wasn't looking for a balanced tournament, just views.
---
The most recent tournament by Tips had 4 druids because the organizer wanted a balance of classes.
---
Down voted for being 100% correct.
---
!RemindMe 49 days
---
Can’t speak for shamans since I haven’t played one, but Paladins counter rogues hard. Assuming both players know their classes, the only way a rogue beats a pally at high level is if he catches the pally OOM. Between stun+Heal, Bubbles and LoH the pally has like 3 healthbars the rogue has to plow through. Using vanish and resetting the fight is useless, the pally will just heal to full. Plate and shield negates a lot of the rogues dmg and the pally can wear down the rogue constantly between Retri aura, Consecration and Judges. Even interrupts can be hard to hit because Flash of Light is a 1,5sec cast and depending on latency that window is small.
---
Right now im trying out classes in a pserver cuz i can not choose what to main and i have found myself playing with my NE druid the most. I have no idea what im doing but i kinda like the fact that you can be absolutely self sustained in the outside world. I also dont mind healing, but i wanna focus mostly on pvp. Lack of burst really hurts the class. Im still not sold on the idea.
---
Notice the perspiration percolating in the folds of her flesh.
---
&gt; Individual server forums
---
It's exactly what he asked.
---
I am pro layering over every other situation i have seen forwarded.
---
She ordered the new plague research started. Only effective against the Scourge, sure, if you take everything at face value. I very much doubt she believed the research was done completely ethically.
---
Are you me? :)
---
We never had anyone play tank in my group of friends (ppl always picks dps class) so this time returning to classic i thought should i roll another boring selfish dps class or actually try a challenge this time? :)
---
It quickly came down to feral druid, cuz even though a prot warrior is the best tank the class just seems very plain and simple while the druid offers all of the options you listed and more.
---
I dunno if im willing to farm pummler though for raids, ive seen the dmg boost it gives but considering you can burn through all 3 charges on just 1 boss fight it just seems like a big time investment i could use without.
---
Tristfall is awesome, but F-tier leveling speed  
---
He should run to durotar so his undead can ride a wolf
---
they were tweaking with layering settings all the time during stress tests and a bunch during the beta. What you saw in your short stress test experience is not what layering will be
---
What is that?
---
It might make a difference in the beginning, because you might not see the same people again and again in the barrens or whereever you are questing, because you end up in a different layer with different people all the time.
---
However would you really remember those names, if whereever you go there are a hundred players trying to do the same quest as you are.
---
It really is a balancing act they have to get right, and they have to manage that over the starting zones and a bit later on in the zones following that, where people are spread out over more area.
---
This may happen but because MATHS the actual advantage provided is far less than most fear.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2tqvs/layering_and_statistical_examination/
---
Tl;DR  if you have double the number of people and double the number of resources you don't really get any more resources despite the layering.
---
Shaman. WF is god tier for warrior.
---
I've heard there's a 5% stun resist baseline for all races and orcs has an extra 25% so you end up resisting 1/3 of all stuns.
---
No, because my friends are decent people so they re rolling Horde
---
Found a butthurt mage right here. XD
---
Then provide the new video from beta where this is happening instead of talking sheet.
---
General formula for scaling is **base cast time** / 3.5 * **current rank** / **maximum rank available**. For instant cast spells base cast time = GCD (1.5 seconds), for DoTs and HoTs there was an additional multiplier of **duration** / 15 (or was it 12?). Max rank of HT was 11  so rank 2 had 10% scaling (11% with Gift of Nature). Rank 3 is almost twice as good for twice as much mana but only 0.5 seconds of additional cast time and rank 4 was the most mana efficient HT rank.
---
100% in the last 2-3 weeks i have not seen random phasing and after that there was a CD added that further limits abuse.
---
Where did you find these high quality photos for zones ? Is there a fullmap somewhere ?
---
Could you link the macro commands you did?
---
This doesn't appear to been occurring anymore. See blizz is fixing stuff :)
---
wait wait do both you absolute spectacle idiots think they are standing on top of them to make it HARDER to fight and SEE the fight?? THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TAGGED FOR PVP ON A PVP SERVER LOL the double idiots above me
---
The fact that people play undead so much whenever motherfucking 25% stun resistance orcs are an option is some pretty strong evidence to me that people like undead just because they're edgelords. Especially if they're playing rogue/warrior, two classes that already do particularly well again warlocks.
---
Like seriously, Alliance has a whole extra class that has an impactful stun and rogue's PvP trinkets don't even include stuns. The edge is just too alluring.
---
Also WSG is going to be the only battleground for a while and Druid is the absolute best class for it.
---
Can you ass the possibility to use scroll on mouse to switch ?
---
Strictly speaking, druid's a better duo partner for just about everyone because you regen mana while in shapeshift forms. But 2 people getting totem effects is pretty sweet, too. Shaman's gonna give you a little better healing for 5 mans and offer the ability to burst in pvp.
---
On retail there is Easy Frames, it makes the health bar larger and class coloured while retaining the look of default frames. It might have some additional functionalities as well. I'm not sure if it'll be ported over the classic though or if it even existed back then.
---
Jeah and never gets past 30
---
What is it about ?
---
in our guild discord we had a vote on it and it was pretty close but alliance won ... we have a few sad troll players haha
---
i'm happy either way, but i've mostly played horde in recent times and i want the different cities and leveling zones of alliance just for a change
---
Not if you combine them. That's what me and my boy are gonna do.
---
1-60 is 5 days of /played
---
In last pserver i mostly grinded with my hunter and it was 6 days, also doing dungeons
---
Ppl talk about how horrible is grinding but they never had grind before xDDD
---
I think that’s why he backtracked on his first comment. Now it’s just ‘grind for a few lvls’ but he clearly meant killings mobs til 60. Imagine that life!
---
Yeah, currently. However that's not the stated design so we should definitely be reporting it as a bug until blizz responds on it.
---
The servers are going to have like 2.5k cap spread across 6 starting areas, not every server is going to be capped from the get go and people will start spreading out as players pull ahead and fall behind. Played through this on nost launch with closer to 5k. Was very busy but you could get stuff done and it was crazy cool to see the place so packed with people, everyone crying about not being able to get mins but it's a once off event you get to be apart of and people want to ruin it by layering everything so you only see 5 other people.
---
On that stress i hear they actually had multiple layering system working. to test the various levels and populations of them.
---
I opened the first link, filtered BOTH factions, PvE and PVP realms, ONLY level 40. Least played is shaman (7%), then go druid and warlock with 8% each.
---
female orcs look awesome in gear!
---
you shut your whore mouth!
---
I'm certain that he didn't exist until Wrath or even later? Maybe Cataclysm.
---
Money has everything to do with it lol. It’s a business, now more than ever. Somebody with two WoW subs and is keeping their head down isn’t going to get banned.
---
&gt; soulstones are a pain in the ass. I don't know if people want warlocks bringing 40 these
---
Soulstones are the things that rezz you. You probably mean Healthstones.
---
You are pretty much correct about Pickpocket. You won't get as much money from mobs in Classic.
---
the whole westfall-deadmines-stormwind lore is so cool.  It's like the goonies mixed with some darker shit
---
I think what this proves time and time again is that retail streamers should really go to a PvE server. They dont have the heart for real vanilla :D
---
Saying it's present in most MMOs doesn't really work towards your point. Current MMOs are hot garbage to the point that the most anticipated mmo this year is a 15 year old rerelease
---
Westfall PTSD checking in ...
---
Cb Prep Dagger is a commonly known spec and nothing new though.
---
I have never used this spec, i found this comment and was curious about this because it seemed that if you go gnome you would have more options for a Rogue spec 
---
And yea good point with the „holding back spells“ ... i didn‘t consider this enough...
---
What happens to guild and player names
---
No i 100% dispute your before 30 claims because i have played vanilla pservers a lot. 
---
the fall off is always around 32 when your options of places to level is STV and well tons of other little areas that no one really wants to do. Issue its STVietnam and level; starts to get slower anyway and people just start falling off. Shit i have fallen off here when i was busy before.
---
Nah that's someone else. I just don't care to argue about the imperfections of South Park. Believe whatever you want.
---
So what are your thoughts on melee leeway then
---
It's hilariously often I'd tank as a fury warrior and some other fury warr would want to come along and dps.
---
Of course I found someome else!
---
Could you offer a link or anything that can back up your 2.5k limit? 
---
Back to the first post on this thread, it’s all good and well to say you’re against it but offering no alternative doesn’t give us what everyone wants. That’s to be able to log in on launch day.
---
Secondly was anyone paying attention to the reddit or wow forums during the first stress test? You saw the backlash blizzard received by people who couldn’t log in and that was just a stress test. 
---
I’m for layering with the layering CD, if implemented correctly grants everyone an enjoyable experience through launch. I just think it needs to be off sooner rather than later (once Blizzard can see a drop in numbers) also stagger turning it off for different servers, allow the more populated ones to keep it on (none past phase 2) but just until they also drop in numbers.
---
firs level 60.. yawn, if you care about this i feel bad for you honestly.
---
[Undead horde's the choice of race](https://youtu.be/5JdK-TD7V-s?t=84)
---
How is 43 vs 45 frost bolts not big? It's more than 4% dmg
---
It is your reddit birthday.
---
Xp triggers a layer changes CD
---
TG = titans grip, which did come in wrath
---
weaponskill vs defense is 0.04% hit, parry and dodge in pvp per point.
---
There are different formulas for pve and pvp.
---
Kinda fair though isnt it? I remember in wrath druids were so powerful, litterally every arena team had one.
---
I think that he meant that because of the gnome racial he has 2 extra skill points because he doesn‘t need imp sprint.
---
And that is exactly my question : is that a big thing ?
---
I don't know if I agree with this. Isn't Hardest-difficulty raid encounter design one of the few things that people still respond positively to and think is well-executed?
---
No one wants I be a flag carrier forever
---
It's not just a keybind addon. It completely redesigns the UI for controller and eliminates the need for a cursor. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5K2NrSZvO4) is outdated and only scratches the surface, but it explains a lot. There are also several videos on the website, including M15+ and raids, tanking and healing too. [Here's some PVP with it](https://youtu.be/E1K-h6-zc0A?t=2135).
---
A lot of classes weren't as good at release as they were in 1.12. For example, just reducing the cast time of efficient healing spells from 5s to 3s untalented made a world of difference for Priests. Before you had to use the inefficient Flash to heal, whereas after the cast time reduction you could switch over to the more efficient Heal/GHeal as your mainstay spells. Those had a much better scaling coefficient on top of that, drastically reducing the need for regeneration phases and Innervates. I know it's a meme that Druids exist to Innervate Priests, but I feel that with 1.10 going forward I did not need Innervates all that often any longer.
---
Anyway, sorry for the hijack. Druid tanks were bad before they got a rework and some tweaks later on. With patch 1.12 Druids are viable tanks for raiding, although Warriors still outperform them.
---
I hate Orcs. You Tauren are alright, don't come to STV tomorrow.
---
You get cat form at level 20.
---
That census is taken from a pve server. Less rogues than warlocks or priests is *definitely* not my experience from pservers.
---
I raided with a rogue on a NA server from NZ. PvE was doable (although I remember failing on Sartura a fair bit) but PvP was just too frustrating. A player had to be locked down to hit them consistently. I could only dream of 200 ping though. All this is moot because like others have said, we have Oceanic servers. See you there!
---
2.5k was the limit when the game launched originally, they been pretty clear about trying to replicate classic and have let us know about any small changes, i've heard nothing about population limit so I'm assuming its going to be set at vanilla's limit, doubling the pop for the game and not mentioning it would not go down too well, the maps were designed with the number limit in mind.
---
Yeah, it happened to come out on Paul Stanley’s latest solo album in the month before this episode

\*\*INCARNATION\*\* \[A\] | NA-PvP | Mon/Tues/Weds | 7-10 pm PST | Hardcore | loot council
---
Hi everyone!
---
&lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community. If you take the time to talk with us you'll see our passion and that we're taking this seriously. 
---
\*\*About Us:\*\*
---
We have a solid core group and are looking to add a few more exceptional players to our roster. Our leadership core contains the following: multiple top 20 KT kills, Rank 14, multi season gladiators, complete private server progression, and competitive world rankings in other games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations. All the information is out there, such as boss mechanics and dps rotations. Even those new to classes/specs will be held to a high standard. We expect before applying you research and understand the basic mechanics and rotations of the class you're applying for.
---
\*\*Expectations:\*\*
---
We're currently fine tuning our raids weekly to ensure once launch comes we progress with minimal delay. Incarnation has an in house instant 60 server we use to ensure every member exceeds standards. We expect our members to be knowledgeable about each encounter and have adequate consumables available for progression.
---
\*\*Recruitment:\*\*
---
High: Mage, Rogue
---
Low:  Paladin(holy), Warrior(fury)
---
Obligatory exceptional players considered
---
\*\*Application:\*\*

Devout Mantle greets you...
---
The first thing you learn when dealing with polling is that what people ACTUALLY DO correlates better with what they will do than what they say they'll do.
---
Stress test maybe, yes. But given that it was so limited I'm not sure of how representative it is - I played hunter for example but have no plan to play hunter in classic. I'd still expect the beta late levels to be more representative.
---
Jesus I feel everyone and their mother is playing priest (including me). So those results surprise me.
---
It all depends on what you want to do. Duel mages? You still go imp sprint.
---
The overall strongest (read most control) spec is 21/3/27 hemo sword.
---
Sure, I'll look into how that can be managed.
---

IIRC alliance locks (because of salv) after debuff limit increase start competing with Mages. Because of ignite mechanic there will always be one mage on top, but the rest of the mages may very well end up under the Locks. Horde locks are a bit more limited by threat but its not a big difference. 
---
Minimum 2 locks is needed for the curses, an ideal comp contains 4-6 Locks (more than 4 after debuff increase)
---
There are tons of fantasy games like that...
---
yeah but that's like 5 quests... horde have cool quests too such as the cleansing of the pools and figuring out what's going on with that

You cant compare shaman and paladin if you filter by both factions as they are only available for one faction, which - of course - will make them one of the least played classes. You either have to double the percentage of the shamans/paladins or divide the other classes by 2, to get a comparable result.
---
Sylvannas used to be a blood elf, she was their top Ranger General and she was the one to extend the Horde's olive branch to them after they got screwed by the Scourge and the Alliance shortly thereafter. 
---
After their homeland was sacked, their numbers dwindled down to almost nothing, the lack of a constant supply of arcane energy screwing with them and thus being forced to rely on fel magics to curb their withdrawal and then nearly being finished off by that Alliance general they were pretty desperate in spite of their usual isolationist and haughty disposition. 
---
So when Sylvannas, one of their own, came and offered them the protection of the Horde they accepted. And I imagine a good chunk of the forsaken, lore wise if not necessarily in game, are blood elves since the scourge tore through the majority of them.
---
Welp, there you go. Thanks for answering your question. Yes, anything with access to healing is not going to die. Anything that can catch you with cc when you shift to heal is going to kill you. Druids can do everything in pvp except finish the job. And druids are modal hybrids, not true hybrid.

A lot of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and friends!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [website](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse) and [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;

#🔎 What we look for in members 🔎
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of **&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.&amp;nbsp;    
---
#📜 Requirements and Rules 📜
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#📅 Guild Events 📅
---
**Pre-Launch:** For those of you that are looking to make friends before launch, be sure to stop by the Discord and say hello! We're all here to make friends and play some games at the end of the day. Wouldn't it be cool to start Classic with some buddies?&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Launch:** On launch day, be sure to show up and enjoy the launch with everyone! Make groups for leveling, introduce yourself if you haven't already, and have fun! We'll be attempting to create the guild within a few hours after launch.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Post Launch:** Immediately after the game launches, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#⚔️ [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ⚔️
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 8:00pm - 11:00pm Central Standard Time (CST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 26th. Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This gives members three months to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 15 Melee Damage, and 15 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
A loot system is currently being determined.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our website and application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;

In TBC what was the best arena comps for a mage? Was it just RMP or did you make other comps work like double POM pyro mage or fire mage?   Also in vanilla did you ever remember melee leeway being an issue in the later patches? Lastly did you do Aoe grinds like ZG crocs etc? How was that compared to private servers
---
Have you seen the vanilla korean damage numbers? they are really better looking imho.
---
i remember in vanilla and TBC trying to get those korean damage numbers
---
You can't trade soul shards and he said:
---
&gt;  it takes 20 minutes to hand the dumb stones out 1 by 1.
---
So I am pretty confident he means health stones.
---
My friends and I went through this. We all played Alliance in Vanilla but switched to Horde for TBC and everything after. Alliance leveling is just way more fun IMO. The Horde starting areas are just way too dull for me. For classic, we were split on which faction to play, but ultimately settled on Alliance because we all agreed that leveling in Alliance starting zones is just so much more satisfying. The Tauren starting zone is just god awful IMO.
---
You said:
---
&gt;the whole westfall-deadmines-stormwind lore is so cool. It's like the goonies mixed with some darker shit
---
Sybil?
---
I have exactly the same feeling. Always had it. My main in Vanilla was ME. I was my main. The immersion in Classic is one of the best ever created in gaming.
---
Thus, the VERY LOW drop rate once you go above lvl 30-ish. It's extremely high during lvl 1-20, but 90%+ of those who get to lvl 30-35, are not going to quit.
---
You just get too connected to your main, you feel invested, A LOT, and you will keep playing it.
---
Main reason I don't think Classic will have the dropout that Blizzard and other expect.
---
or black people not to eat fried chicken
---
(wonder who gets banned for racism first /s)
---
I spent some time playing vairous classes on a private server.
---
Was settled on definitely levelling a hunter until I found that you can't use traps whiel in combat. That along with the deadzone makes me think PVPing on it will be a total pain.
---
I'm going to switch to Warlock as my main instead. Any gear I non-cloth gear I find will be sent to alts as I'll be rotating through them so they can level with  as much rested xp as possible.
---
Thinking of levelling up to 4 classes this way.
---
Thanks for the Macros and the hunter macros.
---
Yes, otherwise Blizzard wouldn't have ended it.
---
&gt; Thank you very much to everyone who’ve helped test the closed beta for WoW Classic. Over the last seven weeks, we have reviewed over 17000 bug reports from testers. These led to our verification of hundreds of new and unique bugs. Your efforts have directly contributed to making WoW Classic a better experience for everyone when it opens to the world on August 27.
---
&gt; We have now reached a stage where WoW Classic is in a good state for reconciling remaining issues, and we intend to shift our focus away from the closed beta, which will end on July 12.
---
&gt; Internally, we’re working through the aforementioned bug fixes, testing the high-level zones such as Eastern Plaguelands, and doing our raid testing. We’ll make sure Ragnaros and Onyxia are ready to go.
---
&gt; As for what’s next, the final stress test is now coming up on July 25-26 (we’ve changed this date since we first announced it). During that global test, we will roll out our multi-region hardware in preparation for the worldwide release of WoW Classic. In addition to getting many more testers to play through the initial leveling experiences, it will be a test of the fixes and tweaks that we’ve made and are making to the game.
---
&gt; We’re planning a small in-game event to end the closed beta on July 12. We’ll see you there, and we’ll post reminders for you just before the stress test, as well as reminders in August as we gather for name reservations and ultimately for the release of WoW Classic.
---
&gt; Thank you!

Yep they are galaxy brained individuals. 
---
This is why in a way i feel bad for blizz. There are plenty of people out there telling them how to fix there game with great ideas , but for everyone one for those people there are 10 galaxy brains shouting absolute nonsense.

After a while yo learn just to ignore your player base because most of them are just dumb.

I would go horde but fuck i hate Orgrimmar.
---
Yeah. The top pic is being used as a reference for aesthetic, which would include the tmog. Which is from Cata.
---
Same here Alliance cities are great but it would be sweet to be a Tauren or an orc.
---
That's how it was in 2005 though. They're re-creating Classic, not iterating on it.

**&lt;One Up&gt; Semi-Hardcore NA-PVP Alliance**
---
**About Us**: One Up is a newly created raiding guild with a small core of players who have cleared all classic content and have a vast understanding of the game. We are fully committed to being as efficient as possible.We are seeking motivated players who are looking for a fun and competitive environment. Our focus will be on clearing content quickly and improving weekly. Our goal is to be one of the top guilds on the server we choose to play on. Our roster is currently around 40 people and our goal is to have around 60 by release.
---
**Raid Information**: Raid times will be 8:00-11:30 EST Tuesday/Thursday. We firmly believe that all 40 man content can be cleared in two days. With that being said we may add a third night to progression weeks in order to speed up the farm process if necessary. 20 Mans Will be done on off night weekly. Our loot system will be loot council that will take rank,performance,and attendance into consideration.

Oh so NOW Activision-Blizzard monetization is just fine?
---
There is something screwy with your table
---
nice
---
Troll Priest, Orc Shaman would be my preference if I were to roll Horde. But I'll probably still go for human Priest and will have to live with the consequences of bit being a Dwarf, Horde community can be a bit hit or miss...
---
I actually liked TB more than Org and UC.
---
classic is new my man. I think you mean Vanilla.
---
You are not getting vanilla you are getting Classic.
---
I hope you also want the loot bug and 1.1 talents right? 
---
Otherwise you are just using the excusing of nochanges. 
---
And that is what you are doing, so too bad i don't accept your argument as you clearly don't believe it should be the way vanilla was.
---
Hemo spec is the best pvp spec for rogue
---
I feel the same for the Alliance at times. I try to avoid blanket statements because there are plenty good and bad people attracted to either faction, hell my best friend is Alliance for Life (she loves the Night Elves, which are super cool yes). 
---
But in my Horde bias I can't help but occasionally think of words like "sanctimonious" and "egotistical" and other less polite things. 
---
Heh, it's funny how good this game is at encouraging faction loyal mindsets.
---
1. Yes, why not?
---
2. Or even in game whispers / gchat. ("Hey I just logged on, want to group up?" "Yeah sure I'm on layer 4." "Ok cool.")
---
3. The only way to stop economic issues is by not doing anything, having massive queues, and then merging all the servers when they become dead, which has its own different economic issues. I don't see a win here. At least with this one, you have to spend about a 30-40 second round trip to find out if each layer even has the node spawned (it may not). Maybe put a lockout if people are hopping too much ("You are doing that too much. Please wait 3 minutes to log in again.")
---
4. Even a ret paladin can kill you in 20 seconds, good luck logging out when getting ganked.
---
Your first two questions make it seem like logging out and back in are the biggest inconveniences ever, and your second two make it seem like its the easiest thing in the world.
---

Did you watch the tournament? they tried horde only zones. They were even getting griefed when they tried dueling in thunderbluff
---
&gt;I want the launch to be flawless
---
I'd temper your expectations. Not one iteration of WoW has had a flawless launch and this will be no exception.

If anything, it'd be inauthentic if *something* didn't go horribly wrong.

There's nothing that keeping the Beta open would do to make the launch approach flawless any better. They have what they need, they have plenty to work on, it will be the best they can manage.
---
On the other hand, according to classic.wowhead runecloth turn-ins are showing to give 75 rep per turn-in vs the private server 50, which is quite significant down the line in saving yourself gold.  
---
With unarmored mounts not existing in Classic for a limited amount of time I don't really see why people would try to rush the rep anyway.

It's electric cocaine mate, we all felt highs and we all going to relapse!

In a guild that has been doing 40 mans in bad gear to prepare for classic, we recently got our second druid after raiding for 6 months with just one.

&gt; Mainstream behaviour on the internet is way more obnoxious than it used to be. The pervasiveness of internet culture adds opportunities for mayhem that barely existed prior to 2010: swatting, doxxing, deplatforming, law enforcement attention for mean tweets, etc.
---
Or allowing racist to spew their insane views online without physical retaliation : ^ )
---
No launch is flawless. It's not about a a 100% bug free launch, but more about reducing the number of bugs as much as possible. I'm sure a lot is going to slip by. There might even be stuff they're aware of but there just isnt enough time to fix.

You are perfect :)
---
Haha, yea it does that to you :)
---
A friend of mine was questing in the Burning Steppes while i was around level 20. On my way from Ironforge to Stormwind I would fly over the area where the dwarves are fighting the ??? dragons and did not think it was even possible to fight these creatures!
---
I later went to the Burning Steppes to farm the scales for the black dragonscale set my hunter is wearing in this video :)
---
Rookie numbers
---
There's every type of class trainer there
---
They are kind of a meme but in a world where every orc warrior wants axes, every human warrior wants swords (not many good maces), every rogue wants swords (just better) and every pvp hero wants big twohanders... Yeah giving the daggers nobody wants to that tauren or elf is actually a good use for them.  
---
Of course their dps is gonna be slightly lower but they are kinda easy to gear with 5/10 dagger skill being pretty easy to get.  
---
Usually it is more a thing done due to loot pressure but it works via having pretty quick and consistent rage gain and being to dump a bunch of heroic strikes very quickly if needed.
---
At geared 60, rogue will lack a lot of damage out put for pvp and dont expect to 2-3 shot anything. Eviscerate is your biggest hitting ability that is burst, but even that it's only like 2k damage at most if you're nax geared. 
---
Rogue is a try hard class that you can only win if you use all your cooldowns and put your target in a constant stun lock. You can beat most spell casters but will lose to a hunter everytime. 
---
Mages are decent for pvp but you'll get rekt by shamans that'll purge your shield and then get fucked by other classes. Or by hunters who will viper sting you and you're constantly drinking. You are limited to just frost tree to be good and you got 2 iceblocks and frost shield for defense. 
---
Warlocks are great for 1v1 pvp, and SL lock can beat I think all classes that cant do enough burst. Maybe shadow priest and shamans might stand a good chance against them. .
---
SF is the best racial in the game for dueling other rogues (yes even better than hardiness MOST of the time), EA is the best for mages/druids, really depends on what you want to be better against.
---
Even when I make my human rogue, ill still be looking at paladins with envy.. wouldnt be surprised if I get to 20ish and reroll
---
Modem?
---
Those shoulder models though...
---
Can verify, he does remember
---
Horde racials are so insane for PvP that it has caused a 33% discrepancy between Horde and Alliance warlock populations. Warlock is the least played Alliance class aside from Druid and maybe hunter while warlocks are one of the most played on Horde.
---
And two other classes have fear as their only reset tools: priest and warrior, so WotF is just a hard counter to the cc of a bunch of classes.
---
Stun resist is a no brainer. Stun resist is so incredible that alliance rogues often avoid opening on many orc classes. There's just not a whole lot a rogue can do vs orc warriors, shamans, and soul linked warlocks.
---
I agree stoneform is great and so is escape artist but they are at least one tier below Horde PvP racials. Horde racials are powerful enough to deter people from playing entire classes, and they hard counter many of the most difficult classes to play against.
---
What exactly does "dealing with PCs" entail? 
---
Let's say you want to play WoW and own a PC capable of running the game. How do you do this?
---
1)Press the "power button" to turn the PC on.
---
1) a)If the PC is already turned on, don't press the "power button" and skip to step 2).
---
2)Double click the "World of Warcraft" icon on your desktop.
---
3)Play.
---
Is there any particular problem with this process that makes people not want to deal with PCs? For example, is pressing the "power button" on a console easier than pressing it on a PC?
---
Oh shit yeah. 6 years, wow.
---
As someone who likes playing traditionally controller-based games with kb/m, I'm not going to shame this guy for how he likes to play.
---
Ah. Yeah I generally only play Alliance and actually wasn't fully aware of what all the race-specific priest abilities did until relatively recently. Looking at those troll definitely seems way better.
---
muh edge
---
That depends. How big is it?
---
A LOT worse. Feral druids don't have mangle and all the bleeds do way worse damage. For pvp, they don't have a slow. As in, any slow, at all. Infected wounds is from BC. No mangle, shitty bleeds and no bonus shred damage means feral druid dps is a complete and total joke.  
---
For resto, there is no lifebloom, no nourish and way worse talents. Also, hots and dots in general got a huge buff in BC because of things like haste and easier to acquire spellpower.  
---
The simple way to put this is: hybrid classes in vanilla were balanced around the assumption that they SHOULD be objectively worse at everything than the "real" classes.  
---
Presumably the payoff is that you can do multiple things... except not really. Feral druid healing in vanilla is shit, resto druid damage is shit. Tanking is nonexistent for any feral spec.
---
Eh. As far as the BGs go, the horde are the aggressors in WSG. AB is, afaik, 50/50, and AV is alliance aggression.
---
To be fair if the guild is already established new recruits shouldn’t be getting loot for a while anyways. Unless absolutely no one needs it. My Everquest guild had a 3 month probation for loot including items that would rot.
---
Bro you realize the best horde race for gittiner done is also the one with massive shoulders right.
---
Man, I really wanna play a rogue. Like, that is my class... I love it. But that hunter sure be looking good, tho... 
---
hmm
---
I'd rather not have it but I can live with it for 1-2 weeks or for uncontested zones.  
---
Contested zones should always, always have all the people from the same realm in them.
---
Thanks! Missed the last test as I was travelling. Much appreciated.
---
You got a source?
---
Seen this in every DKP guild I’ve ever been in. DKP turns into a game within the game.
---
Yeah its a fun show not a realistic guide for leveling
---
Tips was way too distracted, he missed a lot of shit.
---
People who watch superhero movies.
---
exaggerations, do you go asking on the PS4 reddit why they bother to buy it? in the end of the day I would love to have WoW classic on the switch. does that shock you?
---
You mean the one with the hunters mark, right? Raid targets didn't exist back then.
---
This guy Hordes.  
---
Lok'Tar Ogar friend.
---
Well, shit.
---
YES! I even got them to vote, and bribed a few, but the majority still won for Alliance &gt;\_&lt;
---
Good god, everyone *needs* to avoid the Forsen's server.

hopefully u can nuke them before they spam their poly into drinking into shit ton of freezing into poly spam into more drinking into more freezing into ice block into poly spam into rip rogue and sanity. I'll be praying for you, even tho you are alliance filth :) I like your spirit
---
Nice tip, thanks.
---
I’m a hunter, what my prey looks like does not matter.
---
These made great poop books
---
Lok'tar Ogar! to you too my dude. &lt;3
---
or paladin
---
But for the reals, druids are useless you only need one in your raid group
---
&gt;What about it? Sounds like the layers create and collapse as needed and it's not a Blizz employee handling it.
---
I'm not saying an employee handles the creation of the layers, I'm saying an employee can set specific parameters such as layers size and the layers will be created according to those new parameters.
---
&gt;There will still be "an entire realm's population" when you play, which is completely incompatible with your assertion that they will lower the amount of players per layer at start.
---
I'm saying layering has the capability to do that. Whether they do that or not is completely up to them. But stating as a fact that layering cannot address initial overcrowding is false.
---
&gt;Ion says that each layer will have a capacity similar to a vanilla world. I'm interpreting this as your layer population stays constant while server population drops.
---
I believe he's referring to max capacity and he's clearly saying increasing the capacity of layers. So if max capacity is one realm population and then over the course of a few weeks they are increasing capacity it means they are starting with smaller layers than max capacity.
---
Most mobs are missing their abilities, armor and resistance values are wrong. Proc rates are broken. The Admins are always shady and riddled with drama. You never know if you're going to wake up and your character is deleted. Back end algorithms were guesstimated. Plus a bunch of other reasons.
---
Pretty sure the last stress test was open to anyone with a active sub
---
There will not be too many people in the starting zone. There will be a queue.
---
So painfully stuck between dwarf paladin or tauren druid. For the Horde! But paladins are cool and I love dwarves. For the Alliance! But I want a druid and fuck gay bitch night elves.
---
What to do..
---
Man, Back in the day the launch of Vanilla was buggy as hell.
---
There were so many bugs that you couldnt even finish certain quests and had to restart them. But that is what a game makes fun imo.
---
this HAS to be done!
---
classic doesnt even handle 4k
---
PEopLe wHO pLaY tHe GaMe DiFfERentLY tHAn Me aRE PLayINg wROnG
---
funnily enough that was the truth lol, you seem quite irritated - what's the beef?  i thought we were just having a joke around
---
Well I can't say what you need but I ran 4K on the stress test and it was smooth as butter
---
I'm using a 1080ti and i7 8700K 64GB ram 
---
I think you could probably do it with less but have not tested it

How exactly am I shaming him?

go alliance and play dwarf ... the only race worth playing and everyone will end up in ironforge anyway ... f stormwind

**&lt;Killswitch&gt; - NA - Horde - PVP - Loot Council**
---
**Raid Schedule:**  Tuesday - Thursday ; 9 PM ET - Midnight ET.
---
Tuesday's main raid night.  Wed/Thurs for Progression.  Likely only using 1 night a week for a long time as most content can be completed in a few hours.
---
**About &lt;Killswitch&gt;:**
---
Our guild is comprised of a core of raiders from various WoW Classic Servers.   We enjoy raiding, BG pre-forming, and wPVP.  We are looking for players who want a stable environment with a semi-hardcore raid guild.  We don't enjoy waisting our time, or yours for that matter.
---
We believe in smooth and efficient raiding.  Our guild has proven experience in all raids (except for Naxx).
---
**Our accomplishments:**
---
1. Multiple Rank 13 and 14 players
---
2. Experienced Leadership with pre-made BG groups
---
3. Experienced Core clearing everything except Naxx
---
4. Veteran Leadership - our leaders have been there and done pretty much everything in Vanilla
---
5. Active, friendly core available upon launch!
---
**What we expect:**
---
1. People who can make our raid times
---
2. People who want to devote time to improving as a player, but also their character
---
3. Show up for raids with consumes, enchants, and having read/watched strats
---
4. People who enjoy ranking and PVP - note this is optional

They don't stack. You would give the mage PI after Arcane Power fades. Fights will last long enough to use both. Yes you can give the lock PI to increase their dmg but they still won't be out dpsing a mage. As I mentioned mages have a much easier time getting hit cap which makes their damage more consistent cause less resists, and something I forgot to mention previously is Winter's Chill which contributes to mage dps being higher.
---
It‘s not because you can simply skull blind...Orc&gt;dwarf. Also EA is not BiS against mages as you can simply vanish/sprint out of nova or use spider belt, but if you get tidal charmed and don’t resist you got a problem.
---
Technically not true since EU was left out and there is no word on how the next stress test is gonna be.
---
If my friends go alliance I plan to go either female dwarf priest, paladin or druid. For Horde 100% troll shaman.
---
This exactly. Please remove Layering.
---
You really can't compare vanilla to TBC. Druids were amazing in TBC. I raided as one all through sunwell. They were strong in pvp and could top certain encounters in raiding.
---
I'm vanilla you were the worst of the healers and not viable in any of the other specs. People didn't want you healing dungeons because you couldn't rez.
---
I've been spending a lot of time in this sub 'cause I'm excited to relive wow. What this sub is reminding me is that WoW had a lot of spectrum knowitalls, and it's bumming me out. I'm not mad, just disappointed.
---
Even if the tank is oversaturated, it will not be more oversaturated than DPS.   
---
As for high end and guilds... well, it is always struggle to get into a guild as a tank as they usually have already estabilished tanks.
---
BUT WHY, it wasnt like that in vanilla.
---
dont get me wrong i like buffs but i guess nochanges is dead
---
giving an opinion =/= being a knowitall jeez.  relax.
---
Havent really checked what the % GPU utilization is, but it starts ramping up the fan, so its definitely not just sitting idle (like in privateservers). Using a 21:9 35" 1440p monitor @ capped 100fps. Thats roughly relates to 4K at 60fps. Thats on 1080 Ti. Id say any modern CPU will be enough. I think i had everything on Ultra with 2xAA. 
---
If i remember to post it, i can check what the utilization actually is.
---
If i had to guess, something like new AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and maybe a Nvidia 2060 Super.
---
It does. its classic running on todays engine so 4k works and so does 21:9 format
---
1 week only, for a smooth launch.
---
I took some time off work, not keen for server crashes tbh.
---
Disabled forever after that.
---
thats overkill :P
---
That doesn't provide enough information. If OP hypothetically chose to level through instance spamming for example then the "bloodbath" wouldn't be relevant to his experience. Or maybe OP would prefer the risk / challenge of playing on a pvp server. Or the faction that he picks could be the majority on the realm. Lots of variables that can't be predicted that would change the feel of the server.
---
280 is roughly a quarter of one second, its not that big deal.
---
Might affect you if you are melee and plan on pvp a long, ppl might want to lag kite you, this is why blizz made leeway.
---
for raid you will have nps
---
for pvp go ranged, nps
---
You can do that? Pay for a sub without buying the game?
---
I think you have to be subscribed to do this.
---
Yup, buying gametime now unlocks the whole game but the newest expansion.
---
If you weren't a knowitall, you'd have a sense that you're not a great person to take advice from.
---
For wow yeah, but if you want to play other games at 4K id get a 1080 or better
---
At what Res?
---
Ret palas are trash anyways, so playing with a controllee will so you no harm if you choose one!
---
Mage the hardest matchup? Rofl, what are SPriests, SL Locks and Hunters then? Please...RvM is fairly even.
---
Lol how do you know it's overkill if you are asking for specs? Not a troll comment, honestly.
---
Biased how? I have played cleared all content in vanilla, TBC and wotlk so I have the full experience of all 3 versions to make a fair judgement.
---
this is how u end up playing rogue or hunter
---
Ya, but that only becomes apparent at 60. Leveling a druid is pretty quick &amp; convenient at lvl &gt;10. 
---
You can handle basically any situation, even up to 4 mobs if you play well.
---
Yeah, you definitely weren't even alive when Vanilla released.
---
What would you suggest if I did level it to 35? Just wondering.
---
it will lose 80% of the initial playerbase for sure, but it wont be anywhere dead for at least 2 years
---
Undead have an extra gear slot too, is the problem. In a more literal sense.
---
I mean if you don't know anything sure. Druids are actually pretty decent tanks and they're not top tier healers but they're alright given their utility. Feral can be ok dps, nothing amazing or anything but it's not ret.
---
20 a week is nothing
---
Imagine rolling horde and having to deal with barely slapped together leveling zones lol.
---
Druids, hunters and I heard about mages.
---
You really think it takes someone with autism to get irritated at people who spout bullshit for their amusement, then dance to save their egos? You really think someone has to have something wrong with them to not like you?
---
Or are you just trying to pull "I'm rubber, you're glue" because I already pointed used the spectrum bit 3 comments up?
---
**&lt;Nightshift&gt;** | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Horde | Off Peak Hours
---
**Intro:** &lt;Nightshift&gt; is a guild for any Classic WoW players who want to play and raid during off peak hours on a US realm.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Regarding raid days and times, there is a survey in progress but the plan is to have 2 scheduled raids a week. At the moment the days most people can make are late Wed night/Thu morning, late Thu night/Fri morning and late Fri night/Sat morning. And so far 1-4AM/2-5AM/3-6AM EST raid times seems to be most popular.
---
But it's still early days, as the guild grows and the game progresses there's always the possibility of additional raid days and/or raid groups.
---
20/40man Raid loot will be distributed by a loot council - made up of officers, plus 1 random raid member for transparency.
---
**Looking for:** Anyone with an unusual schedule or in a different time zone who has a passion for Classic and a good attitude. We are mostly in need of dps, but all applications will be considered. If you're interested in an officer position, please be sure to provide more information on your application. Purely social members are always welcome.
---
**Moving forward:** We will seek to be a semi-hardcore raiding guild that pushes to clear the latest content all the while enjoying ourselves. We may strive for greatness but our primary goal will always be having fun!
---
**Apply:** If this sounds interesting please apply using the link below:

---
thats not the point you made..you said i was wrong.
---
It makes sense logically that it's going to be planned that way, would be a big unannounced change from blizzard to do it differently.
---
They have the right to be punted!.
---
I smiled and exhaled through my nose deeply
---
No, it means bringing 40 people to a raid group. Jesus.
---
# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt; NA Horde PvE Competent Raiding
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
Leadership is experienced in raiding and we are currently in the process of recruiting more Officers, Raiders, deciding which PvE server to play on, and the guild tabard design.
---
All raid times are EST. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two nights is quite doable. Tuesday 7-12PM Thursday 7-12PM
---
Loot will be given out by loot council. Primary decision makers are the Class Officers, with other officers and Master Looter serving as oversight to (hopefully) prevent most loot drama.
---
No single person has ever carried a 40 man raid to victory. You do not need to be an all star to join us. However, you do need to be able to pull your own weight in the raid. If we can assemble 40+ people who all pull their own weight, not a single raid boss will stand in our way.
---
If you aren't looking to raid, but want to be a part of the guild to run dungeons with or just hang out, there is room for you in our ranks as well. **You only need to post an application if you want to raid.**  
---
Please, do not apply if:
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.
---
\- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.
---
Do apply if:
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for, if you have questions you can ask them in our Discord, or PM me on discord. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Shizune the guild leader.

It's not that I entirely disagree with you, but resto druids aren't that much in demand compared to a holy priest, paladin or shaman.
---
1 or 2 resto druids in a 40man group is much more feasible. However, I am talking from an efficiency point of view. More casual (read: non-hardcore) guilds most likely won't deal with this kind of thing and indeed probably bring 3, 4 or even more.
---
Yeah but then again I was smoking weed
---
Friends.
---
Yeah something like that should be enough! thanks. and please check what your utilization is on and what fps you are getting. Thanks!
---
please re-post to /r jokes
---
&gt;Give me one class/race combo that looks better than the other raid sets for that class. 
---
If paladin T2 wasn't the best looking set in the game, ret paladin would be it.
---
Hell yeah man those things can run anything!
---
The worst part of the whole thing was the double druid roll for opener. That's just sad.
---
Yeah I know. It is real nice vs warriors. But I want to kill mages and cloth wearers not warriors and hunters. :)
---
usually in life when someone disagrees with your opinion they just say it, but you seemed to get irrationally upset and then use sarcasm/passive-aggressive comments to demonstrate your disagreement.  What I said was tongue-in-cheek and blatantly just a casual opinion but you seem to have treated it as though I stood on a box and sermonised that I knew the gospel truth to everyone
---
all I can say is that this REALLY reminds me of my friend with aspergers.  Nowhere did I suggest that people who get "irritated at people who spout bullshit for their amusement" must have autism.  You've misrepresented me and tried to put words in my mouth
---
also, the reason i was "typing out laughing at my own jokes" was not because i was laughing at my own jokes, it was to indicate that they WERE jokes.  If I said "pigeons should die" you might think I was serious, but if I said "pigeons should die haha" then you should interpret it as a joke.  This is why I was wondering if you're on the spectrum because... you're fucking hopeless with social cues and getting irrationally angry in response
---
Paladin is the best healer in the game, both PvE and PvP.
---
Teenage me was like: "eww alliance, the boring choice, the kid carebears, horde are badass!"
---
30+ year old me: "oh we playing alliance this time? alright np"
---
He wants realm forums for individual classic servers, is it really that difficult to understand that...?
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting:**
---
**- knowledgeable raiders (all classes);**
---
**- LUA coder who can help our tech team build our custom DKP addon;**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, we are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy in both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, those raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 80% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
​**Intended raid/play times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to raid on Mon, Wed and Sun, from 19:00 (CET Timezone). Each raiding session will last around 3-4 hours.
---
**Aditional info:**
---
\- While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core;
---
\- Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet. It all depends if we can finish in time our custom DKP addon. Hence our need for a LUA coder.
---
**Bottom line:**
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/) ​ or check our Discord here [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK ](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

---
Warrior. Definitely Warrior... but Tauren or Orc?
---
...If I go Orc I could play Shaman - I love it thematically.
---
But, if I'm not going my OG main warrior... then why not go Rogue? I've always enjoyed Rogue.
---
Capital reputation from quests.
---
50% of playing a healer is knowing what addons/macros to use and once you learned to play "whack a mole" you can start focusing on cooldowns, resource management, mechanics, etc
---
No need for the real life threats, that's just creepy dude
---
You need to lead a guild into nax
---
Even if layering itself is necessary, the current iteration of it is terrible.
---
WoW is meant to be a single seemless world. Layer hopping kills that.
---
Players should be forced to pick layer after picking servers, and layers should not be hoppable. That would be a huge improvement over their current mess of layering implementation.
---
I'll be the guy to mention druids ability to have an instant cast range pull that costs zero Mana and reduces the targets armor. This and +5% critical for the warrio.
---
Shamans are better because of windfury totem so you should accept that and [LET IT GO.](https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok?t=142s)
---
There are some questions; how long will phase 1 last? Some people will nolife to 60 in the first week and start farming lotuses and thorium and devilsaurs uncontested while everyone else is still levelling. That's fine, but if we can switch layers at will by joining a group or guild, they get several servers' worth of those high end resources to farm. For how long? Maybe phase one will be over in a month, but thats plenty of time to bank enough resources to never have to farm again until phase five.
---
So i dont think layering should cover high level zones; it doesnt need to, all the overpopulation will be in the starting zones and the low to mid level zones. Have it so that when you zone in to searing gorge, or un'goro, etc, everyone's in the same layer.
---
For the lower level zones, fine. Have layering. Keep it on until phase one ends, no worries.
---
If you don't mind me asking, how did you make enough money in 10 years to retire early?
---
Rather by the HPS meters for all raid tiers. Paladin is mana efficient thats true.  But their overall output cannot really compete with priests and (In 40 man) shammys. Also nobody doubts the utility but they are not top PvE healers, not by far.
---
Ty for your answer ... it was very helpful ... 
---
As also played vanilla wow ( even Rank 14 with my Paladin ) but most of the people I knew tbth didn’t seem to care about racials ( at least not in the beginning ) ...
---
Honestly? Get something like [this](http://kvtatanagar.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/couch-pc-gaming-couch-pc-gaming-table.jpg).
---
Please don't attend group activities with a controller except maybe with friends. Pretty much everyone else will kick you or never invite you again when they find out. And they will find out pretty quick because of your performance.
---
Glorious cake day
---
Dagger warriors work because warriors dps/dmg isn't based on weapon damage. Everything is based off of either AP or just dps. And daggers have super high dps. So you are able to get yourself the aged core leather gloves and rock two daggers you are going to pull a lot of dps. We had one in my naxx raiding guild and he was super competitive to the other warriors.
---
Roll a dwarf rogue and never look back. ;)
---
Or orc stun resist. Tauren increased melle range +stun
---
&gt; People with aspergers LOVE bullshit. Mostly their own, thus see above
---
at least we agree on something
---
For people saying there will be a que,  private servers have had 30k people on one server on launch day with no que. A blizzard server can easily accommodate 10k+, the only reason a server would have a que would be If it's legit full or they artificially cap it. In that case go to another server.
---
Small .. ha ha ... indeed i remember TBC at first when a gnome could sit down in the black morass and eat, then drown :D

So that's a yes to the earlier question of "I'm rubber, you're glue." Thanks for clarifying.
---
JSON is not code.  It's a way of organizing data, like a list of bullet points, a comma separated list, or a spreadsheet.  The core concept in JSON is **key-value** pairs.  Which means some **key** (a descriptive name) maps to a single **value**.  OK.  Let's see some examples of valid JSON.
---
 `{`
---
 `}`
---
You can google hot new twinks.
---
For world pvp dwarf is better. For organized battlegrounds, gnome.
---
Im not sure what this means? Could you explain
---
&gt;how fucking retarded do you have to be to insist on dpsing those whenever tanks are the most in-demand role?
---
You will see a lot of these at 60 too. I joined groups in need of tanks, only to be invited into a group with 3 fury warriors and a priest.
---
I never bother with those groups. I straight up tell them to either find another tank, or kick two of the warriors in favor of some other class.
---
Not tanking a dungeon with 3 other players needing my loot lol.
---
Horde 1-30 is contains a lot of running because the barrens is such a massive zone and because zeppelins are so unconventionally located in vanilla. Running from the flightpath in the middle of orgrimmar to the zeppelin platform outside already takes minutes, then you have to wait for the zeppelin to actually arrive, only to have to run all the way into undercity to take the flightpath. Comparing that to Deeprun tram or menethil/theramore/auberdine (with nicely positioned flightpaths right next to the boats) is pretty sad, but something you're going to have to deal with for the entirety of the game.
---
The lower level you are, the more quests there tends to be available. You could go straight into barrens after mulgore at level 10, but you would quickly either run out of quests entirely or start struggling with orange monsters that will take ages for melees to kill in classic because of the increased chance to parry. If you swap zones only after running into a brick wall, you will have already outleveled a hefty chunk of the available quests in the other zones. You have to pace your short term gains and look at the bigger picture in order to not screw yourself in the long term. Everybody has to make the long runs at some point in order to get flightpaths and fetch important quests, so differences even out over time. You might as well get some value while you do it at an appropriate level.
---
I was very conservative with experience from monsters and didn't allow myself any rested in order for nothing to technically be mandatory. If you look at the level estimation bar and find yourself ahead of schedule for whatever reason, feel free to skip crowded/annoying quests. Another positive aspect of being ahead is that you can group up with anyone guilt free and get kill quests over with twice as fast.
---
Yes, but the amount of dagger rogues to warriors/rogues that are going for other weapons such as axes, maces and swords is a lot less. Therefore you are more likely to get upgrades per tier of weapons. And there are a lot of really good daggers you can pick up along the way.
---
Game design shouldn't be based around a casual lifestyle.
---
Druids
---
Definitely gonna be me
---
I'm curious, did you play classic before? 
---
I know it seems like we're getting a sort of undertuned version which could be good for grinding. But so 1-60 just takes so fucking long I'm baffled when I read about people wanting to grind it. Why would you do it instead of mixing in quests and dungeons?
---
Thats pretty good, except its straight up stolen from a German Audio-Adventure from way back in Vanilla called Allimania.
---
Write your own jokes dude.

This allows you to just have one button that will cast moonfire (or another spell) on mobs as normal. If you are healing a tank you can also throw a moonfire on the tank’s target without switching targets or having to press a special button.   
---
Works great for adding dots when healing demand is low.
---
Actually yes! ^(Though this might have to do with that I always smoke Mary Jane when playing WoW.)
---
Ye man perfectly viable
---
Just shadow works fine tbh. The dungeons and MC aren't something you need to spec for to heal effectively.
---
Everyone's swinging to Cambridge
---
The journey is the destination in classic,  leveling is tons of fun because of the forced player interaction. Limiting that is not classic
---
Add a hashtag before the “show tooltip”, reddit app used the hashtag to bold the text.
---
Raiders don't get time to look at your fancy art.  They're staring at  a bosses ball sack, or ass if they're melee or tank and playing whack-a-mole with health bars if healers.
---
Only ranged dps really ever have a chance to look around, which is why they're the shitter classes standing in fire all the damn time.
---
I want to main an Undead Warlock.
---
Most probably I'll have a Gnome Mage as well, as some friend will join Alliance.
---
I loved Badrastas videos and his UI and model edits. I started getting into caring about UIs and model editing my gear because of him and had changed my mages gear to be the GM gear edited black like his.
---
&gt;  If the player is so flaky that this causes them to quit, then they probably weren't going to sub for a long time in the first place.
---
The one oversight here is the share sub between classic and retail. A lot of retail will play classic for a few days/weeks then just go back to retail. No lost sub and no lost money from those players since they are paying for "Retail" anyway.
---
Yeah, this is a good point actually. As a Druid you get Tier gear thrown at you with nearly no competition.
---
There's also some fantastic Feral gear in AQ that literally nobody else wants.
---
Besides loot council (we are doing onslaughts loot system) my guild &lt;Doggo Noir&gt; hits all of y'alls check boxes. We raid Tuesday/Thursday @ 7-11pm EST. We aren't doing meme specs and will be tracking raid attendence. Let me know what y'all think and shoot me a line. I know you guys have been looking for a while and would love to have you on the roster.

name 3
---
Looking forward to it but I’ve got a few books to get through first (Star Wars: Dark Nest Trilogy, The Commonwealth Saga: Judas Unchained, War and Peace).
---
.
---
I can't promise anything, but I'll make an effort to look for ways to make it usable on phones.
---
In favour of layering if it means a smooth and playable launch from day 1.
---
If a solution was required, perhaps there could be a dedicated realm in each region that had layering entirely disabled. Everyone who wants to experience crashes at launch could play there.
---
Music to my ears

---
They copied the under 20 slightly wrong. it's 1 - (the rest of that formula). For the base, I took the average of the bottom and top numbers of the tooltip, the +healing is assuming +300 healing. I didn't bother with talented modifiers, 'cause lazy
---
Yea I think people who plan on grinding to 60 have never played before
---
I think there is a major difference between PvP and griefing.
---
I seem to remember that covering anything, a quest NPC, a vendor, a mailbox, with your character model (big tauren on his kodo was very common) was a bannable offense and still is in modern WoW. I know for sure you get suspended in WoW for covering an NPC in a neutral city to make players attack you accidently and die from the guards.
---
For this reason, using a lvl 1 alt to sit on totems to prevent players from clicking probably isn't allowed. Same as swarming the players or their pets with 5 players to eventually lead one of the duelers to click the wrong target and enter PvP.  Anything that exploits the lack of collision in-game to overlap models with the intent of griefing probably is a bannable offense already.
---
Playing on a PvE server would change nothing to this situation. Horde alts could still sit on totems or swarm players to prevent you from clicking. Alliance characters could still do the same and prevent you from using tab targeting as well.
---
Now the big PvP battles that happened under Orgrimmar later in the tournament were fun to watch for sure and solid group PvP. And I've seen an alliance streamer say "see, that's what they should have been doing from the start, all we wanted was to PvP" which is complete bullshit. The plan from the start was to interfere as much as possible with the tournament, they asked to **grief**, never to have some large scale PvP on the side.
---
Yeah this is super old. I had this up as a background during wotlk.
---
Seeing as OP has yet to ask for clarification or for me to expound, I can only assume he is quit satisfied with the insight I have given him.
---
Yeah this seems pretty horrible if playing something other then paladin.
---
No, the numbers agree with me just fine. 
---
I didn’t walk back any statement. 
---
I don’t have any problem with the lengthy explanation you’ve made. It just doesn’t have anything to do with the argument. The argument was whether they have a flash heal. They do. You yourself showed this. They argument was **not** whether they have the *best* flash heal. And I made no such assertion (nor did I complain about a challenge to it, so your quote of me at the end is wholly irrelevant). You’ve made an obvious move from the former (whether they have a flash heal) to the latter (whether they have the best flash heal), which is why I didn’t engage in an argument with the latter.
---
That could be said for a number of streamers.
---
We won't find out until we grow
---
For beginners its magic. Magic is always bad, because priests, paladins, resto pots can get rid of it.
---
Hamstring for example is just ways better.
---
Supported x 10000
---
i have had enough classic wow private server launches to know exactly what im talking about. I love beating the zerg and getting ahead of it, thats a big part of why i think fresh server launches are so much fun.
---
if you take shadow out of the equation yes. you can make hybrid pvp priest specs that also heals well, but as shadow? hell nah.
---
Go Druid. Jack of all trades, find what play style feels right for you, then make a new toon to match that play style and go from there.
---
THIS!
---
There will be extremely knowledgeable players - a few more than there were back in the day. But there will be a lot of other players as well.
---
In the live game this won’t happen because community events won’t happen in phase 1
---
Everyone will be farming levels or gear and mats.  
---
pserver kids won’t be able to buy gold for max engineering (at least without risk of ban)
---
The default UI isn't great that is for sure. When I tried healing I think I was using luna unit frames which I have seen been recommended. Could mouseover frames and see how much health lost a target had as well as overhealing. But like I wrote the run went horribly, lots of wipes and angry party. Was just a bad experience so I decided to not try healing any more.
---
I see it happen all the fucking time, you are a priest or a druid and charging your 3 second heal on a target with half life and right before/ as your heal finishes two flash of lights land on the target bringing them back to full hp.
---
Genuine question: How? BoSac cancels sheep, paladin has 6second stun on shaman which gets tunneled by warrior hard all while the paladin doesnt even need to BoF because he can keep the warrior dispelled while he runs after the shaman/mage.
---
how about you try showering and rubbing your skin when it's crumbling and rotting all the time &gt;:c
---
&gt;For me it's as bad as a level 60 ganking lowbies. So if that is tolerable on a PvP server then what happened during these tournaments is fair game. Because when I am trying to quest in Duskwood and keep getting one shotted and corpse camped by a bored raider, my "event" which is levelling and gearing up is impacted.
---
Pretty much exactly this. If I can get killed/disturbed while fighting mobs why would it be disallowed to be killed/disturbed while dueling?
---
Fair one, maybe it's just me being cynical, felt a bit shillish lol.
---
I am curious about your responses as I didn't heal in vanilla but I will be this time around. Whilst I have read enough to kill a librarian I don't have the first hand experience.
---
I really think they should have gone up to 60. They could leave the raids for internal testing but all leveling content should have been in the beta.
---
I feel like the decision to stop the beta was less because they're sure they have it all covered and more out of fear people will burn themselves out before the game is even released.
---
Most of my friends are Horde and we managed to bully 2 of them to pick Horde.
---
Those pointy eared elf cunts need to go back to their own country.
---
Well that's a rather dreary outlook on things. I plan to have fun.
---
64gb ram is definitely overkill. 16gb is sufficient.
---
&gt;Will you then be moved up the list when people suicide or will you stay at the spot you were at
---
If you read what he said, you stay at literally the same exact position but the people that were at the raid change positions with each other.  So if you were in 3rd on your armor list and the 1st and 2nd person suicides down, that would mean another 2 people would be in 1st and 2nd and you'd still be in 3rd.  
---
As for your other question, I'm not sure how he would handle it but what I always did was benched players got equal loot incentives as long as they are 'ready to raid' the second someone has to leave or D/Cs.  It's only fair if they are committing the time to be a backup for the raid that they are compensated.  If they log off, decide to run dire maul, do BGs, ect.. they get nothing if they can't be summoned by the time a warlock zones out.
---
good luck dealing with Saurfang
---
Do you not have a phone? Lol
---
Not if you do any sort of video editing and streaming.
---
My fav was when tips insisted on inviting guzu to a party, buffed him accidentally and then guzu dueled and had to forfeit for having buff on.
---
What cpu and can you check how much load that have aswell?
---
One item per week while raiding would be awesome!
---
But shouldn't it be the other way around?
---
You don't even agree with your numbers. In another branch of this comment thread, you claimed that rank 3 healing touch would do 500 healing. You said so while replying that no, Regrowth isn't the druid flash heal (why anyone would argue this, I can't), Rank 2 HT is. Then in this thread you said no they don't, they have regrowth. blah blah blah "ok fine they don't have flash heal but they have flash of light which I will pretend is what i've said all along" Which I have demonstrated is just stupid. The shitter analogy applies: you don't waste time using scissors on a square of TP, and for all other situations, you've got bigger shit to worry about.  And I'm going to apply that analogy here: kiddo, you may be the worst kind of diarrhea, but today, for the sake of argument, you can call yourself a one wipe, 'cause I have bigger shit to deal with today. Ciao
---
You had me until blast through BWL,AQ40 and Naxx
---
Heaven forbid a dungeon group needs to slow down and strategize a bit before a pull. New players will find that Classic is a whole different beast even if it is simpler.

Most JSON you will see starts and ends with these guys.  They represent **objects**, which are un-ordered groups of key-value pairs.  When I say un-ordered I mean that the following two examples are equivalent, semantically, and most programs won't (or shouldn't) treat them differently.
---
        "name": "Bob",
---
        "age": 30
---
vs.
---
        "age": 30,
---
        "name": "Bob"
---
Within my pair of `{ }` curly braces I've got two key-value pairs.
---
**Keys** are always wrapped in `" "` quotes and followed by a `:` **colon**.
---
**Values** \- you've got 6 possible types of values that are valid JSON, and which one you use determines the formatting.  The first two we've used above - I'll give examples of the rest.
---
1. **String:** Originally meant a string of characters.  Strings represent **"text data"** and are always wrapped in quotes.
---
2. **Number:** What it sounds like.  12345, 0, -999, and 45.678 are all valid numbers.  No quotes.
---
3. **Object:** We've seen this before.  We use **{ }** curly braces as our value!  Then we're free to **nest** even more key-value pairs inside of this new object.
---
4. **Array:** This is what we use when we want a **list** **of multiple values** under the same key.   We surround the values in the array with `[ ]` square brackets.  The values in the array can be any type you want, even if the types aren't the same (though this is uncommon for reasons that make more sense if you're a programmer).  Arrays are also special, because instead of an `{ }` **object** as the root of our JSON file, we can use an `[ ]` **array** instead, if we just want a list of values, and don't quite need keys at the root level.  E.g. an **array of objects** that represent students in a class.
---
5. **Boolean:** This is how JSON represents **logical** (yes/no) values.  Accepted values are the words **true** and **false**, **without quotes and lowercased.**
---
6. **null:** The keyword **null** represents "the absence of value" and is usually used if you know that a value will be provided for a key sometimes, but is being omitted for one reason or another.
---
Let's put it all together with a simple example:
---
        "subscribedToEmails": true,
---
        "favoriteFoods": [
---
            "Pie",
---
            "Spaghetti",
---
            "Pizza"
---
        ],
---
        "address": {
---
            "street": "New Street",
---
            "number": 123,
---
            "aptNumber": null,
---
            "city": "Townsville",
---
            "state": "MN"
---
        }
---
This has a little bit of everything.  Our **root object** has the keys name (string), age (number), subscribedToEmails (boolean), favoriteFoods (array, this one is of strings), address (an object).  Address has a mix of keys that include strings, a number, and a null value.
---
 We could shove this "Bob object" into an **array** full of other people with a similar structure.  Since arrays can be at the root of our JSON file instead of an object, this is also valid JSON for a list of movie ratings:
---
    [
---
        "Avengers: Endgame": {
---
            "stars": 8.7,
---
            "genres": ["action", "adventure", "sci-fi"],
---
            "rating": "PG-13"
---
        },
---
        "The Matrix": {
---
            "genres": ["action", "sci-fi"],
---
            "rating": "R"
---
    ]
---
Note that you don't need to have things on new lines (the genres below are on a single line).  The "standard JSON indenting" is just there for readability.  You could have the whole thing on one line, if you wanted.  But why would you want that?
---
That's literally all there is to JSON.  It's a nested hierarchy of data.  It's nested because using a combination of arrays and objects, you can create an infinitely "deep" structure, depending on what you are trying to represent with the data.   Feel free to ask any questions you may have about this.
---
nah the only race I find disgusting are my allies... gnomes
---
a friend in my friends group is afraid we'll all quit and he wants to go alliance and we want to go horde. it's really hard to convince him but I think I see your point. I've experienced getting ditched like that least we rolled on the faction like that. being stuck in the opposite one must really be salt in the wound

Undead fucking warrior.

Who’s this no-name tryhard?

**Mom and Dads of Warcraft (name still undecided)**
---
Is your child on cool-down?
---
Have you finally been able to cast hibernate on your baby? Then this is the guild for you!
---
We are currently looking for other mom and dads who are eagerly awaiting the release of classic and want to get back into it despite the debuff of parenting. We are hoping to create a guild that is a community for parents who enjoy playing and are looking for like-minded players. A community that understand each other's situation without the need to always defend themselves when they just cant come online, or miss a dungeon run and so on.
---
There are no requirements or expectations to raid or pvp, however this might be an option if there is enough interest as soon as people turn level 60. It is expected that the guild will be most busy after 8 pm when the little ones are gone to bed. So at the end of the day when you are tired of farming diapers or leveling your child, log in and come relive the classic experience with us!

yeah for AQ40/Naxx, where the Mages will get PI to get a super-Ignite. but in MC/BWL, the Warlocks have a good claim to PI
---
i mean sure it used to be feasable, but then everybody else had shitty ping too. games are just so much better with low ping. you should get less than 80 ping from NZ to syd but where the OCE server is.
---
Yes, I think it's been well established that they have a 1.5 second cast similar to lower ranks of Flash of Light. Thanks for doing the legwork on showing that. 
---
If you're going to try to dunk on someone, make sure you know what you're actually arguing.
---
Nothing learned is common knowledge as far as wow is concerned. Plenty of new players need this info
---
Just wait for the tanks who think they can permapull Stratholme without resting in questgear. lmao gonna be hilarious
---
Like I said, you gave a revealing answer. Then, you doubled-down and revealed even more.
---
What you mean? WoW IS and was casual compared to what I experienced in EQ, even in WoW's most HC form.
---
Now, this isn't to say that WoW didn't require grinding and farming (it did), but EQ was always a step above both in how competitive and contested the content was (basically everything was contested) and in the amount of time you had to put in to farm and grind.
---
But see, the thing is, noone is asking for any sort of easy mode.
---
People just want to be able to actually play the game.
---
"Casual lifestyle" or not, this isn't high tier raiding we're talking about it. It's the game being playable (or not) at early levels, avoiding queues, overcongestion and subsequent empty servers.
---
It takes no skill or knowledge to wait out 30 other people to kill some boars, just time. Why would anyone be AGAINST layering (especially for a limited time, especially for lowbie zones only)...?
---
Grinding to 60 is not the correct way to play this game
---
The idea of "classic plus" is appealing to me but I think it unlikely.
---
Make sure and roll alliance buddy! They are the best
---
Actually ret pally, ret reckoning to be precise, is insane in duel, Wpvp or premade if with a healer. Also, as reck stats persist death, it can be an insane EFC killing machine
---
Better flex those muscles to really show the stress of beta test.
---
Worth noting that private server leveling dungeons are harder (higher mob damage) than they will be in Classic.
---
I'm chillin all day in Undercity, Idgaf. For the Forsaken!
---
Cpu is hard to test since there are a lot of factors that come into play. Especially add-ons  have the largest impact on your CPU cycles per frame. I have a 2700X currently, but Classic has about 1/4th of the activity compared to retail so if it's purely for gaming I would say a 9600 or any Ryzen 3000s would suffice.
---
ez, I am going for orc human, and shaman warlock
---
Where are all the PvE Oceania realms at? Been ages since I’ve seen any advertised.
---
They should be more than fine since classics gonna be based off 1.12. Druid tanks aren't "optimal" but you can still use them for all manner of progression fights, in BWL and even some wings of Naxx.
---
why does this sub have so many threads where people want a class/spec to do everything? 
---
“I want a spec that is top 3 dps in all pve, super strong in pve, can solo dm with 1 spell and and AND AND AND....
---
Because bg’s aren’t up til phase 2
---
Start with a simple setup like the default raid frames for 5man with class colors, tank first, only show debuffs you can despell, and use something like clique to bind you spells. Once you feel comfortable healing than start looking how to modify your UI, you don't want to try to figure a new UI and multiple new addons at the same time you learn to heal.
---
!remindme 48 days
---
no
---
For most single application use, sure. But who knows if they are Streaming, Video Uploading, etc while they are playing WoW.
---
In Preraid BiS druids have more threat than any other class, and that's even without MCP
---
I FOR SOME REASON AGREE, I WILL DO IT. THANK YOU FOR THIS. I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
---
These list are ridiculous and are for people that don’t understand how the game works and never plan to pvp.
---
So let me get this straight, right now this is your time in the day summed up in a 24 hour period:  
---
sleep: 8 hours  
---
work: 12 hours  
---
Girlfriend: 2 hours  
---
WoW: 2 hours  
---
what it needs to look like is:  
---
sleep: 5 hours  
---
work: 8 hours  
---
Girlfriend: forget about one of these.   
---
WoW: 11 hours. 
---
EZ.
---
Probably my favorite copy pasta of all time.
---
Explain, I feel there no issue with dynamic respawns.  It adjust to server levels, and allows a more balanced economy that can support any population size, rather than an gimped one.  This would lead to high population server, bigger communities.  Being on a dead server is no fun.

  [**&lt;INFORMAL&gt; \[NA\]\[A\]\[PVE\]\[SEMI-HARDCORE\] MORNING EST**](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/informal-na-a-pve-semi-hardcore-morning-est/180589) 
---
**INTRO:**  
---
This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. A new or old player, If you are dedicated, I want you on the team!
---
**GOAL:**  
---
\-week 2 or 3 MC clear  
---
\-begin split run MCs in phase 2  
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently  
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)  
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:**  
---
I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need.
---
**LOOT:**  
---
Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**  
---
RAID TIMES - EST, MORNING  
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST  
---
RAID DAYS - MON / WED / THUR
---
Discord - Dzb9rj5  
---
discord ID Ironskillet2#7445  
---
**The discord is fairly active with lots of classic chats going on already!**
---
(as you can see, our current roster is pretty set, but I am still always very accepting of casuals who match our times as well! even if you dont have time to raid you can still join our split runs to see the raids on occasion and even help us grind dungeons! And of course any exceptional players are still welcome to apply as positions in 40 man raids often reappear)
---
**CURRENT CLASS NEEDS**  
---
Warrior tank (low) (MT closed)  
---
Warrior dps (low)  
---
Rogue (low)  
---
Priest (low)  
---
Druid (low)  
---
Hunter (low)  
---
Paladin (low)  
---
Mage (low)  
---
Warlock (low)
---
Taking any exceptional player of any class!
---
Only 8 players need rep with Hydraxian Warlords to use the runes to summon Majordomo Executus in MC. I think it'S honored. Just takes a few hours in Ashara. It's pretty easy. I don't know of any of raiding rep requirements unless you plan to go blacksmithing. Thorium Brotherhood recipes require rep. You also want to go exalted with AV faction to get weapon as early preBIS. if you like Humans, go for it for the rep I suppose. Pally with stoneform is annoying as fuck for horde, though.
---

---
Maybe back in the day (I remember people complaining priest leveling is worse than warrior, which is just dumb), but nowadays... Spirit Tap isn't that novel of a mechanic, warlocks have it as well.
---
Shaman/warrior. Make sure one of you has 300 mining come DM release so you can do jump runs. Enchanting as well, level 1 is fine.
---
Noice
---
I’d say Shaman is a bit better from a PvE perspective and Druid is better from a PvP perspective.  Warriors biggest weakness in PvP is lack of gap closers / getting kited.  Druid has more CC to help with that. 
---
At the end of the day both would be good.
---
We're talking about urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrleee game. different itemization from what you're thinking of. apples to gnomes.
---
Yeah the 47 online players definitely needed layers.
---
Worgen Demon hunter is the best choice.
---
You like the paladin T2,5? An orange reskin of the purple you see on the picture?

**&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance**
---
**Introduction:**
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
**Looking For:**
---
    High Need:
---
     -  Rogue
---
     -  Hunter
---
     -  Paladin
---
    Medium Need:
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Mage
---
     -  Priest
---
     -  Druid
---
    Low Need:
---
     -  Warlock
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.

My first character will be a Troll rogue because the first time I play, right before BC, I rolled a troll rogue that I got to level 27 before abandoning for a belf paladin. I still feel bad about it so I'm giving him a new life. 
---
And then I make all my alts so they're there when I need to change it up.
---
I would not worry too much, generally speaking as I have played on vanilla servers before, people are always nice, always cirlejerking and talking about how they love vanilla and how nice the dungeon is.  
---
Maybe the people have changed in the 1-2 years I have not played on  vanilla servers, but especially as it will be blizzard server, where people have to commit money to play... and have waited to long, I think you will encounter nice selection of players.  
---
Of course you will see assholes too, that they are everywhere, just the % is different.  
---
Keep in mind to not be quiet and say what you want in dungeon, you feel like people are acting dumb, tell them hey guys... do this or that. There are many quiet stupid groups who just need a guy to say "hey, whats up?" "let's go this part too"

__**Guild name:**__ Beta Delta Nu (ΒΔΝ) 
---
__**Server:**__         East Coast NA PvP 
---
__**Faction:**__       Horde
---
__**Language:**__   English
---
__**Loot:**__ DKP/loot council or Roll rank advantage/loot council - TBD
---
__**Raid hours:**__ 8:30 pm - 11:45 pm EST -- Tues/Wed/Thurs - TBD
---
__**Signup:**__ https://discord.gg/HjW9N9W
---
__**In need of/Requirements:**__
---
We currently have open recruitment for Every role. We have a little bit of everything at the moment, with 15 core raiders along with other casual players tagging along.
---
__**Introduction**__
---
ΒΔΝ is an NA East Coast guild led by WoW veterans who are well experienced in GM roles and raid leading. Collectively we have raided and PvP'd through all of WoW's lifetime from Vanilla to the current retail expansion, BoA. Our members' ages range from mid to late 20s, but we welcome all 18+ applicants.
---
We are a semi-hardcore raiding guild who also love to world and BG PvP. We do plan to clear/almost clear Molten Core by 2 months after release. Progression raiding will only occur during raid hours; however, you will be expected to gear and collect consumables on your own as well.
---
__**Loot and Raid Hours**__
---
Our loot system and raid hours are not set in stone, but they are most likely what will be in place come Classic. Our loot distribution system will be overseen by a loot council in order to intervene with loot distribution as needed in favor of whatever is both best and fair for the guild.
---
__**Conclusion**__
---
With that said, we do like to have fun – this is a game after all. We don’t take ourselves too seriously and try to help others when we can. We don’t encourage a toxic culture but we do like to joke around a lot. If you’re interested signup at the discord link above and follow the instructions in the #read-first text channel.
---
Do you have a link to the actual chair or the model info? Looks comfy.
---
You simply need to make new friends, in the horde. Lok’Tar Ogar
---
Every class has these upsides though. 
---
Downsides of feral. 
---
Laughable pve dps, even if you live in Gnomeragan you won't do more damage than your main tank. 
---
Yes deep feral can tank and dps, but it can't really PvP well. 
---
Gear competition with rogues, hunters, enhance shaman and warriors. You are the lowest priority for new gear. 
---
Maybe 1 raid spot per guild. 
---
No regular rez, which doesn't matter so much for feral but sucks for resto. 
---
No burst damage at all.
---
aah what do you know, another layering ciclejerk in the comments. I guess people would love to waste their vacation days being stuck in a slideshow in deathknell collecting skulls and bat wings for hours
---
Coming from a holy priest perspective:
---
There are a couple of differences in the types of healing; healing while leveling, 5man (lvl60) dungeon healing and 40man healing are all very different. Mainly the first thing you'll have to learn, is the ability to quickly heal as fast as possible with down-ranked spells and without (any) over-healing. Doing this will increase your skills on mana efficiency and overall healing output. This is very important in raids, because with (roughly) 10 healers you don't want to snipe any other healer. To reduce any effect of over-healing by (accidental) snipes (i.e. I cast greater heal with 2.5 sec cast, but you cast flash heal with 1.5 sec only 0.5 sec after I started greater heal) you'll have to split up the healers in at least 2 ways; Assigning specific healer(s) for each individual tank, for the raid itself and any by roles (i.e. resto shaman on raid healing, holy priest on tank). The second way to minimize any snipe healing (this depends heavily on what guild you are in) is to require an addon for healers that calculate any "incoming" healing that is being cast at the time on raid frames. Being able to cancel-cast your heals to let another healer finish their heal or skipping a player that is already being healed is a great boost on your overall healing from the raid.
---
How healers will heal in the end, is also very determined by their gear and/or  3/6/8 tier set bonuses. Down-ranking is a very real thing and you must learn how to do this properly, even before acquiring any kind of good +healing gear. The hardest part is to get past the initial gearing part, where you are most likely lacking any kind of mana regen/spirit, +healing and maximum mana. Down-ranking with little to no +healing gear yield dangerous results with the other side of only casting max ranked skills leaves you without mana after a couple of casts. This will also be very apparent on early raids, so don't feel too bad about not being able to heal effectively early on. As in raids we have many healers, we can rely on others, but in 5mans this is not so much true and thus making it seem quite difficult to overcome. This means popping a lot of mana potions &amp; drinking water for mana.
---
In the end, there is no definitive answer to how or what a healer specifically must do (besides what I listed above) as it very well depends on your own skill, play-style, gear, tier sets, raid setup and so on. It's about mana management (mp5 rule, down-ranking) with fast reaction, pre-casting and the ability to get a "feel" of any incoming damage in any given scenario. This will improve the more gear and skill you obtain, which will give you a lot of leeway and help to develop your own healing style. Keep in mind there are wrong ways to heal and wrong healing styles, but this also depends per class.
---
One of the benefits you get when playing a healer, is to be able to get decently fast groups going on and able to make these groups yourself. If you show your healing skills, people will befriend you and ask for future group play and/or even get you into a guild. And if you have solid healing skills, you'll more than likely carry everyone in 5-mans, even bad tanks!
---
Bullshit.
---
99% of classic wow reddit is alli dude they will crucify you....
---
So much jokes on druids, i feel like 1 in 3 posts is bitchin on either oomkins, wether feral is tank viable or how feral kitty is abusing game mechanics. GO BACK TO PICK ON HUNTARDZ ALREADY
---
do the retail addons work for classic?
---
It isn't though. Each layer will have a full server's worth of people. They said you'd still have hundreds of people in northshire, they literally used that as an example.
---
It's entirely possible to min-max without looking things up.
---
It just requires a brain.
---
I'm super thrilled that for the least played class in vanilla, EVERYONE is ready to present their expertise on druids.
---
I'm glad to know I can still get under people's skin this much. I'll take solace in the fact that you still haven't engaged in the actual argument (the argument was not whether they had a spell equivalent to the *priest's* Flash Heal; they argument was that they have a 1.5 second heal ("a flash heal"); unless you want to really take on water and argue that paladins don't have a flash heal), leading me to believe that the truth is in there, beneath all the celebratory bluster, nagging at you.
---
Server tech has come a long long way since 2004. The ques would be pretty minimal because servers can hold so many players now.
---
...you have roots...insect swarm and moon fire are your additional “bleeds”....you have to shift to win....
---
&gt; undaed roge
---
checks out
---
&gt; the quickest to gear up are healers then dps in raids,
---
So, 37/40 raid members are “quickest”?
---
Can't wait for a retail player that started in Legion think he can tank  Deadmines at lvl 15 with his friends, rush in without CC and just die.
---
Yeah that element of competition was constantly taking negative blows due to scuffed stuff like that. Fair play to Tips because he handled it pretty well in my opinion. I was pretty shocked to hear Guzu gave that up lol
---
Whirlwind is based off weapon damage so this isn't true. You won't lose like 90 % of your damage going daggers but it's definitely less dps than other high weapon damage alternatives. The trade off is having epic daggers from raids is better than having blue weapons.
---
In Vanilla, progress meant developing your character by progressing through the content. Story was bound to the world and everything would evolve around you.
---
In Retail, your progress not directly through the character - rather it is proxied through secondary systems such as the Heart of Azeroth and daily rewards. Basically, whenever you see a progress bar outside of your character window.
---
So... high chance I’m one of em’
---
Because there's a class who can be top DPS, top tank AND top in PVP. Respeccing is expensive though.
---
As a priest: thank you. Many ranged dd seem to try and kill the healer as fast as possible.
---
It’s been 84 years.
---
Ok you have 2 minutes to answer so you can’t look anything up - if I roll a warlock what is my exact leveling path and which gear will I be using in every slot for what level range?
---
Never trust an Elf, especially hunters...
---
Dwarf main btw
---
Lol, do you need some more salt?
---
You misspelled Troll* Shaman
---
Sure
---
Kill it with fire.
---
We understand the launch problems, we gave your proposed layering solution a chance in the beta. This is no longer some #nochanges reflexive dismissal, layering is hot garbage and there's a pile of evidence to prove it. Blizzard is on the cusp of something great and they're gonna kill it before it even gets a chance if they move forward with layering.
---
Got to get them when they are young, can't bubble hearth just yet.
---
Is there a technical difference between this and "servers" and "merging servers"?
---
I'll be playing, I just won't be taking the day off lol
---
I'm afraid not. My go to Bag addon is Bagnon which just creates one big bag frame. [AdiBags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags) is an addon on retail that allows more customization and create multiple "bags" for certain items. However, neither of these addons retain the default UI's look.
---
Pick the race you like the most, the racial skills are not all that important. It's more important to have a character that is fun to play when one that has a 0.001% advantage.
---
This quest is horde only
---
Great way to make money to buy that epic mount though, and anything else you need.
---
1) “grinding to 60” isn’t the premise
---
2) for mages it is actually the fastest way (past a certain level)
---
3) there is no “correct” way to play wow, and phrasing it that way makes you sound like a neckbeard 
---
4) fuck off
---
Thank you.
---
Then they are bad healers. Spam-healing is not skillful. Managing mp5 rule, pre-casts/cancel-casts rotation, dispels and any "feel" of incoming damage is where the skill lies in.
---
purge bosac?
---
You can also gain new friends from the Horde
---
Don’t worry, they are a vocal minority. I believe most hardcore casuals will still take a few months to hit max because we have jobs and school and the like. You’re not alone!
---
Those are the exact 2 I'm stuck on lmao
---
I work at a university.  If classic dropped at the end of spring g semester, criminy!
---
Anybody who goes to Redridge at lvl 15, especially several weeks into a pvp server, is out of their mind. Redridge is more suited for lvl 18+. You'll run back and forth between other zones and you delay your westfall questing by going there earlier. Only sensible reason to go to redridge this early is that you powerlevel without quests and expect less competition for mobs there.
---
Tell me how the other rogue is going to survive/blind if you skull the first blind? It‘s not gonna happen, perhaps if you play with worn daggers and druid T0. Yes, in a series of duels everyone waits for cds. Rogue is literally unplayable without cds, you are not a warrior...
---
Don't complain when I exploit layering everyway I can.
---
They're trying to PLAN this?! Those motherfu--
---
Me : Which class should I play ?
---
Reddit : Yes.
---
Why not NE Hunter shadowmelding is sooo much fun
---
Keep crying bfa kiddo
---
The supreme supreme Gentlegnome has spoken.
---
I wanted to since NE hunter was my absolute first char in vanilla back in 2005. But all my friends want to play horde so got to go there which sucks but is rather play with friends than alone :)
---
Eh disagree with the deleted part. I’ve had the same characters on Kr for almost 5 years now.
---
One thing that has gotten me very excited for classic is the good mixture of hardcore min/maxers as well as the casual hype for the whole thing. Private servers were okay for a little bit when they would start fresh, but after a few months all the casuals got run off every server by toxicity. Here in a fostered environment I've seen so many people excited to just start fresh and experience it all over again. That has really stoked me to give it a good shot and enjoy my time with vanilla.
---
&gt;I constantly feel like my decision is wrong because of something is going to be too tedious for me to enjoy my class even after leveling.
---
Used to be like this and always ended up going tank or healer because I was being more "useful'...
---
Doesn't matter in classic - you'll suck and be good all at the same time. 
---
Every roll doesn't play and isn't as strong at every class in that category. 
---
Don't try and plan how many 60s you want - focus on one. 
---
Go rogue.
---
Do WoW get many new players these days? I'm pretty out of touch with what kids do
---
&gt;If I wanted to be an animal, I would just be a panda.
---
Or Horde. Filthy, filthy animals.
---
There are three types of zones in WoW: alliance faction zone, horde faction zone and contested zone.
---
alliance faction zones:
---
* elwynn, stormwind, westfall
---
* dun morogh, ironforge, loch modan
---
* teldrassil, darnassus, darkshore
---
horde faction zones:
---
* durotar, orgrimmar, barrens
---
* mulgore, thunderbluff
---
* tirisfal, undercity, silverpine
---
All other zones are contested. 
---
On a PVP server you are auto flagged for pvp in any contested zone and as alliance in a horde zone or as horde in an alliance zone. 
---
On a PVE server you are only autoflagged as alliance in a horde zone or as horde in an alliance zone.
---
"heal mc"....you realize MC is the beginning of raiding and not the end?  it seems like most of this reddit page things mc is the pinnacle of classic wow.
---
anyway...a lot of guilds will bring a hybrid spec priest to raids for shadow weaving and healing (they wont have a shadow priest)
---
best pvp priest spec is PI spec.  shadow priests are only good for 1v1s.  most pvp will involve groups of people where a priest is better suited to heal the rest of the group.  if you want to be a pvp caster play a mage or warlock
---
You’re mentally ill
---
So many Bed, Bath and Beyond trips. Talking about curtains? Let's talk about curtains, Fam. That end table should be moved to give the apartment better flow? Let's dig into that idea, move it a couple times and really discuss it. Random flowers incoming because "it's Tuesday and I love you".
---
Come August 27th though... "New phone, who dis?"
---
The organization is just bad.
---
- Set far away locations for every pair of duelists
---
- Set hearth at a backup location in case a griefer comes up, giving them 5-10 minutes before anybody can travel there.
---
- Communicate the locations off stream to every pair
---
- Watch the action either through the players' POV, or through a streaming spectator, and watch it through the main stream active, from the person organizing.
---
This way you have a clear way of making it happen. Each pair duels in a different location which makes it appealing as well, cause you have duels on ice, duels in the barrens, duels on an island, etc... Looks cooler. If a griefer comes along, both players hearth and have their duel at hearth location which was kept secret. Main streamer goes from POV to POV so his char does not intervene and can't be griefed either.
---
And that's just from the top of my head. Zero organization was done, there are way smarter ways to make this happen.
---
Making new friends.
---
Go to xpoff.com and look there in the 39's forum. Some people started to gather and organize for realms/guilds
---
&gt;every hunter will have one.
---
Every PVP hunter. He's useless for PVE.
---
And wanding.
---
their animations are also pretty cool, the only thing i dont like is the sort of old-lady-stoop posture they have when they are using melee weapons
---
I will outdps you in that garbage spec.
---
Probability prot warrior for raiding at least. You just need to spam sunder armor and occasionally use a couple other abilities. Set one button to tab targeting and it’ll be doable
---
Why would anyone do that? You're supposed to guess at every turn and obsess over small details that you think are signs until your life spirals out of control and you get a divorce which could have been avoided by having a simple 20 minute heart to heart.
---
Im playing darksouls 3 again in the meantime. Invasions and builds never get old i'm just trying to fill a void till release
---
Yeah when I played on unofficial servers I only played in casual guilds and all these "viable" compositions never happened. Been in raids competing with 4 other hunters for loot etc. Still cleared those raids and I personally enjoyed it more since I got to play with friends instead of strangers that played the most optimal way.
---
Not just Hunters I think. Have you considered (feral) Druids?
---
Bears will run around with Unyielding Maul or Warden Staff, being highest priority for weapons untill blessed Qiraji Warhammer from AQ40 (which they don't have competition for I think).
---
Kitty's will run around with Bonecrusher untill Draconic Maul from BWL or even later AQ40/Naxx gear (and I'm guessing you are excluding Atiesh from this system).
---
Their priority could either be utterly useless because of literally 0 competition with other classes and exclusion of Atiesh, or it will mess up shared weapons with other classes in AQ40/Naxx.
---
I remember the concept of main assist back in the day, basically one dd who would pick targets and everyone just targeted and assisted him, so all damage would go on one mob. Back before raid symbols were a thing. Or a hunter marking the target with the hunter mark.
---
&gt; our spouses
---
hahaha
---
Meh, druids are the fastest levelers in game. No downtime, sneaking past anything relevant, fast running from 22, faster running from 30. Wouldnt say the hardest to play.
---
You can't die with all those buffs.  It breaks pve.  A monkey could clear naxx using the world buff exploit.
---
This post had so mutch potential if used right
---
I imagine the types of players on Classic will be something like this:
---
1. The hyper knowledgeable private server elitist who will basically yell at people in Dungeons and tell everyone what they're doing wrong before either leaving or kicking someone. Will be a tank
---
2. The hyper knowledgeable veteran WoW player that will be super chill and willing to take things slow and explain to other players where they mistakes are and how to improve. Will be a tank or healer
---
3. The absolute most retarded DPS player ever that will likely be a rogue and try to pull shit when he or she isn't supposed to, wipe the group and then say, "lol".
---
4. Vanilla WoW returnee just chilling and taking things slow. Doesn't say much in dungeons unless asked upon and will silently send out friend requests to people he or she deems fun to play with. Plays tank/healer/dps.
---
All bugs have been reported at least once, right now it's just meaningless to keep people playing this demo. The bugs you hear about the most aren't about the level as well, so pushing it to 60 wouldn't help investigate leeway or layering. Now they're off to fixing everything left, I mean it's not about trust, it's just the process.
---
Same faction stuff is always a lower bar to meet for blizz intervention. But alliance killing horde is fair game for any circumstance sans straight exploiting. It's not griefing to camp someone's corpse. That was peak vanilla.
---
this is better than most people posting here
---
at least he understands that playing a priest will most likely force him to heal people
---
It's not even worth it.
---
You can on pve realms dude...  Besides, do we know if that will be true in  classic on pvp?
---
This is all highly anecdotal, but I've tried a "fresh start" in between MoP and WoD, both Horde and Alliance. Never got a good for any of those characters, so experience is PUG life only. I have a couple of old (vanilla to Wrath) Horde characters on my home server as well.
---
From what I've seen, Alliance players tend to be more laid back and friendly. They will generally be more patient, but will not go to extremes to absolutely finish a key in time.
---
Horde players in general seem to be much more aggressive, and are more likely to insult other players. In Horde PUGs you will always have at least one of those people: tank that will pull trash by just running through multiple groups by spamming his one AoE ability. Ranged DPS that will not get out of fire. Melee DPS that will go out of their way to stand in cleaves. Ranged DPS that will stand in cleaves. DPS that will pull completely unrelated and often unnecessary trash, even if the tank is miles ahead with 4 other trash groups. Healers that will DPS instead of healing. Spells will not be interrupted.
---
From my experience, Alliance PUGs will fail at mechanics, but will at least try. Horde groups are much more likely to just brute force encounters with complete disregard of any mechanics involved. If it's a wipe, there's always a leaver. In general, people on Horde will abandon groups much earlier than on Alliance 
---
As I've said, completely anecdotal and in general/on average. There's more than enough twatwaffles on Alliance side and really cool people on Horde. On average, I've found that if I want a friendly group with laid back people I'll have more luck with Alliance.
---
Awesome! How long does the flag last before it changes back to normal?
---
Yes, I and likely most of this reddit page realizes this is not the “pinnacle” of raiding. What we accept is that as casuals, MC and if we’re lucky BWL will likely be the farthest we go. I don’t plan on ever stepping foot in Naxx, and that’s ok.
---
Yeah, comon with that 20hrs a week, fucking casuals /s
---
reputation grinds: AV exalted (Healer OH), AD revered (shoulder enchants/naxx Frost Res), rest is for professions iirc
---
Thats a great way to get kicked before you do the third boss in like any dungeon
---
You can go human only if you're playing casually and really care about the looks (LoTR wannabe or smth :D)
---
Otherwise, if you're somewhat minmaxing, NEVER roll human, regardless of class you're playing. 
---
Even if it's rogue or warrior - OK, you've got your weapon skill bonus, but the early raids in Vanilla is just a 2 hours a week. 
---
There is 168 hrs in one week, and by 166 of them you're voluntarily putting yourself in a trashcan. 
---
It's never worth it, raiding is just a  small part of Vanilla gameplay.
---
This is the original, the artist sent me. He just didn't have the version without text overlay anymore, and as in my comment, the one shared in the other post without the overlay has a lower quality. No need to be rude about it.
---
How did we get here...
---
From J Allen Bracks own quote: 
---
"Brack is clear that using modern server architecture doesn’t mean that these Classic servers will have the same features that current World of Warcraft does. There won’t be cross-realm servers or Looking For Raid and Dungeon Finder automatic party matchmaking. There’s still a lot of questions about how the team will tackle it, but Brack says they’re committed to recreating an authentic Vanilla World of Warcraft experience. 
---
###“One of the tenets of Classic WoW is none of the cross-server realms and different [server] sharding options that we have available to us today. There’s a lot of desire on part of the community that this is something that they don’t want.”

Play as a UD warrior. You used to be a paladin before you became forsaken and lost your connection with the light.  You could do the same with a priest too I guess, used to be a paladin but now your body is weak
---
even my fairly-decent guildmates did this to me (i was resto druid).  it pretty quickly became a meme with us and we had such a good laugh doing dungeons and raids.  one of our MT players used to joke around with a macro for saying like '20 second mana break dont cry plz'.  He got the nickname 'el toro' because he would charge in when people were still thirsty :D
---
here's a hilarious vid of him getting insta-gibbed while people were drinking.  best guild i've played in by a mile.  [the charge of el toro](https://youtu.be/ZnGmMiKyKbU)
---
I can relate, I was young as well while playing WoW! I was so proud to get the Rohk'Delar before older dudes that were much more equiped and raided more often!
---
SHP
---
Here everyone trying to decide what race/class they’ll be and all I’m worried about is finding an English speaking guild that raids m-f during normal business hours. Which will prob be damn near impossible.
---
You only really need to stand out over the other ~10-12 people who can wield it. But you're still likely competing against at least one guild officer.
---
I think you're underestimating the insane amount of players there would be in the starting areas for the first few days but most of all day 1. That's not a real classic experience because vanilla never had that particular issue. There are a lot more people excited for classic right now than there were back in the day for vanilla launch

"It's toasted."

Grid + clique is really good
---
If you roll alliance, the only excuse for not playing gnome is: “gnomes can’t roll that class”
---
Im sure people will have twinks ready by then, discussing it now should be no surprise.
---
The real answer to your question is the staff is not actually a dps boost for the wielder. A mage is better off with the 1h sword and offhand combo.
---
Mate, do you even know why they are doing layering? The server cap is going to be closer to 10k. They're rolling out massive servers so that when all the tourists come and go, the servers will still have a strong population.
---
You're posting on the EU section btw.
---
That's not at all how it works.  Not sure why you think it works like that.  Every time you log on you could be placed in a different layer and people have moved layers mid-play as well.  You can move layers if you join a party with people in a different layer.  Not only that, but the people around you can move layers in that same fashion.
---
this guy gets it

Real warriors are bring up by the HORDE!

my thoughts every damn time

Risky click of the day. I'll pass my good sir.

Best controller I'd recommend would be a keyboard and mouse.
---
Pally set looks the business. Gimme that orange over the purplz every day.

Have fun downranking
---
&gt;nk Deadmines at lvl 15 with his friends, rush in without CC
---
Have You been sleeping for the past couple of months? People in Beta literally do that all the time and I've never seen them wipe because they hadn't used their CC.
---
wow sounds a lot like my life
---
the sucking part not the wife part lol
---
Grow a pair already.  Sick of everyone crying about first world problems.  Go live in the middle east or central africa for a year and see what real problems are.
---
Yeah, the color scheme fits the class and the model actually looks pretty good on humans and dwarves.
---
life cant be easy when you this stupid
---
really enjoying them! keep em coming!
---
Yeah all the med-high pop pservers got a super big wave of new players a bit back and this is prob based on that experiene
---
Oh yes of course, if you level to 60 in about 6 days (which is very fast for a new casual player in vanilla) then you'd have to play that character for 14,400 hours in order for your leveling to be 1% of what you do in the game, lol.
---
I disagree
---
I play PS and some of the strongest healers are druids
---
Obviously paladin and priest heals are stronger on the tanks, but the idea equally skilled druids can't outheal priests is a fallacy.
---
They're also the most versatile healer 
---
In a 40 man raid, having less than 2 resto druids and 3 (more likely 4) total druids is simply a mistake, you're going to miss out on dmg from buffs as well as having fewer battle resses.
---
This notion that only certain classes/specs fit into progression guilds is really silly.
---
Theres really not any classes/specs (other than meme specs like spell power hunter) that's going to cause you to wipe on raid bosses in vanilla. 
---
Having 50-100 less dps from your boomkin rather than a mage is literally irrelevant when the boomkin can sleep Dragonkin and entangle the large trash mobs in AQ...
---
Vanilla was never about dps race speed clearing, idk why people are making it about that now.
---
If you're racing to server first rag, ok fair enough you need every ounce of dps you can get. The other 99.9% of us? PLAY WHAT U WANT
---
I think the community might have been better because people came from EQ. I'm on a ps too and it's horrible from a social point of view as well.
---
If you're in the area of a group quest, people will just try to ninja-invite you - communication? Why? The ones that 'talk', try to manage using y/n and thx. People are socially retarded. They really are. 
---
On the fourth day I was in a group that actually started to talk because we were waiting for someone. It was about an hour - someone had to leave and the others said 'Welp', 'I don't care', 'I bet he was useless either way' ... after an hour of friendly banter.
---
In my head these are the people that write they don't have friends and are looking forward to play a social game when they have no regard for other players and severely lack social skills. #soushL
---
I'd rather have to live in one persistan world full of people than in different layers(which is just a new name for shards). People who dont want to compete just start a few days later and have none of these problems.
---
Also my main concern is with all the tinkering of a remastered version of WoW we end up with something that is less accurate than some blizzlike private servers are. Layering still separates a servers population - and one persistan population was one of the key strengths of vanilla wow. 
---
People wanted Vanilla because it was(felt) hard, was full of mess, had lots of people and many friendships were made. Layering is against all of that. 
---
Odd its called Classic, because it ain't anything flavoured. It is so synthetic, killing the spirit.
---
I played on release of nost and there were like 3k people in tirisfal glades alone... It was totally unplayable.. but after a week it was back to normal... I guess they could implement phasing till level 20-30 or for the first week or even add dynamic respawns but imo keeping till phase 2 (release of diremaul) which will take like 2-4 months is just awful and will kill those appealing aspects on the journey to 60 and whole pre-raid gearing phase... That's just such a bummer for me... Phasing is the worst solution since it kills sense of integrity/authenticity by fragmenting the world.... just look at the picture above or at[ this popular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ) esp the last clip at 9:00 is painful when that large crowd starts to dispensary in front of that guy's eyes... TERRIBLE
---
I was originally set on a Priest, no even second thoughts. Now I am discounting that largely and deciding between my two old favorite (Mage and Rogue). Mage is currently winning out but only because I can't decide exactly what kind of Rogue I want to play.
---
Not really. My vanilla character was 17 days old before I ditched it. Got 60 at /played 13 (first char). Second one on other server was 60 at /10 days played, ditched it at /24 days played...So still like 40% leveling. There's thousands like me. Not everyone plays to 60 in /6 days played and keeps a char up to 100 days played (which still makes it WAAAY more than 1% of your time leveling).
---
I just came back to BFA, and this is me trying to figure out what to use my boost on lol
---
I know we're suppose to circle jerk hate on streamers crying but think about griefing the tourney because you weren't invited. Super childish
---
If you are Alliance non-dwarf priest people know you aren't serious
---
The classic pvp discord has a twink channel : https://discord.gg/f72SbnR
---
We all will
---
I did [a lot of testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/?) at 1080P and 720P, but not 1440P or 4K. My guess is that you can get by with a GTX 1070 for 4K 60 FPS Ultra, though that might hang a bit in heavy raid settings. I'd say at a minimum to get an RTX 2070 Super or RX 5700 XT, though.
---
8 GB of DDR4 is plenty for 4K, but if you're building a higher-end system, don't go below 16 GB of DDR4.
---
CPU-wise, any modern CPU should be fine. The new Ryzen 3000 series, the Ryzen 2000 series, or the 9000-Core i5, i7, or i9 CPUs will be plenty.
---
Utter
---
Moo
---
Get it?
---
The only way history is repeating itself is that people are already crying to no end about how they think the game should be. Instead of just enjoying it for what it is and playing what the devs envisioned.
---
Do you want BfA? Because that's how you get BfA.
---
yeah and not in the fun way lol

 &lt;Birds Of A Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players
---
who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have
---
done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as
---
it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: Someone who is dedicated. We require 80% attendance otherwise
---
you may be subbed out. We understand things happen but just don’t make a habit of it.
---
Someone who can raid on Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 7PM EST to 10PM
---
EST. Someone with a good attitude, doesn’t rage, and doesn’t complain. Someone who is
---
willing to help others and is team-focused and not individual focused. Someone who is
---
competent, willing to learn, and ask questions if they don’t understand so they can do it right.
---
How we operate: As stated above we will be raiding two days a week from 7-10PM EST on
---
Tuesday and Thursday. As for loot we will be running Loot Council. The team will decide how to
---
distribute loot based on several factors including (but not limited to): Attendance, performance in
---
raids (Moreso your ability to listen and do mechanics as opposed to pulling high numbers.),
---
what you contribute to the guild (helping other players, crafting/enchanting things for people,
---
etc.), and just helping the guild in general.
---
What we are recruiting: You can see what we are recruiting for on our website. Currently we
---
have a high need for ranged dps/healers
---
You can contact our GM on discord @ frail_#3482
---
Here is our App: https://boaf.enjin.com/recruitment
---
And here is our discord: https://discord.gg/5mCdyTt
---
This is like your ideal 'do it all' tri spec: http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGscZbhtZVMgz0t
---
what do you consider "casual" raiding?  two nights a week for 2-3 hours each night?
---
 but there will be no gear for your spec 
---
That's simply not true. I won't go deep into all the offset gear there is in all raids, but take T2.5 for hybrids. It's clearly not for healing. But you've probably not tried any of those offspecs yourself so can't blame you. Just try not spreading false information. Thanks.
---
It depends on the guild. I've been in several competitive mythic raiding guilds and my business trips were not an impediment, as I was always present for the raids with those exceptions. They always knew in advance (few days at least, as my trips sometimes are from one day to another).
---
well you will most likely get what you want since it's the issue between principles and being "$accessible$to$boarder$audiences$" as blizz puts it... aka the mentality that killed retail
---
The difference in healing between a Priest and Druid isn't so low that you only want "1 or 2". Having more brez and more innervate is never a bad thing.
---
Our founding fathers fought for my right to complain about first world problems, and I intend to damn it.
---
Feral kitty is underrated because he's tricky to optimize. Back in the day, information sharing sucked, so the few optimized ferals didn't communicate properly. Here's what makes feral dps an interesting option for raiding and what people don't know...
---
The weapon doesn't matter. It's a stack stick. 
---
Ferals are supposedly agility characters because cat form turns 1agi into 1ap. This is wrong. Ferals are mainly str characters. It's not written anywhere, but 1str = 2ap. You want a ratio of str:agi to be 2:1 so you can have high AP and crit.
---
Your rotation is a lie. Don't do it. The absolute best way to dps is to use the crafted level 40 hat that gives 20 energy on shapeshift and the talent that gives 40 energy on shapeshift, along with -30% manacost on shapeshift and the talents that reduce shred's energy cost. 
---
Shred is a 350% damage + 180 something damage backstab ability that costs somewhere around 45 energy with the talent and has no cooldown. You shapeshift, shred, if you get an omen of clarity proc, shred again. If you do, you'll have enough energy for a 3rd shred. Now you're out of energy. Shapeshift back into human form and to cat again. 60 energy. Repeat until you run out of mana, using pots and innervate.
---
Now you have very good melee dps. Not the best in the game, but definitely not last and definitely viable for raiding. 
---
Now... Combine that with those: 
---
At the end of your feral tree, you have a talent that gives 5% crit to your whole raid passively. This is insanely good. 
---
Mark of the wild.
---
Tranquility.
---
Roots.
---
Brez.
---
Off-tanking.
---
Cleanses.
---
Ability to free yourself from any cc.
---
The feral druid is an absolutely viable option, but among the 3% of players that dare try it, 95% have no idea how to use it correctly in raids, so the meme keeps spreading.
---
How do all you fuckers have friends?
---
Oh my god I didn’t even consider gender in my selection! Back to the drawing board I guess.
---
It was up to a few days before raid night. You could sign up weeks in advance though.
---
Well said. 
---
Here's to hoping they can see that they've pushed this big red button before, and everytime they did they set the place on fire, up until this day. 
---
And look what's left of the game.. it's a shell of it's former self, if even. 
---
It's so far removed from the great MMORPG genre WoW once dominated with it's immense quality, and instead is a weird amalgamation of a solo player/multiplayer/ARPG type of game which is mediocre - underwhelming in each aspect. 
---
It makes no sense at all they'd bring one of the things into Classic which helped WoW slide down that downward spiral very efficiently already.
---
They even know themselves it's something players don't want in Classic. Here's J Allen Brack saying it himself:
---
Brack is clear that using modern server architecture doesn’t mean that these Classic servers will have the same features that current World of Warcraft does. There won’t be cross-realm servers or Looking For Raid and Dungeon Finder automatic party matchmaking. There’s still a lot of questions about how the team will tackle it, but Brack says they’re committed to recreating an authentic Vanilla World of Warcraft experience. ###“One of the tenets of Classic WoW is none of the cross-server realms and different [server] sharding options that we have available to us today. There’s a lot of desire on part of the community that this is something that they don’t want.”
---
www[dot]pcgamer[dot]com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/
---
????
---
ret paladins were really good in pvp
---
Ok. You got me on that. Gnome actually look ballin’ in t2.5 but they look sick in T2 aswell with the mohawk bigger than the rest of their body.
---
part of it is the retail mentality 
---
the other part is that many folks want to PvP and Raid but realize they cant afford to respec that often
---
...are sure this is serious ? I mean... Really ?
---
Also not never helped that on literally every server I was ever on, Alliance outnumbered Horder like 5 or 3 ton1.
---
It made sooo many of you guys soft to the point where a lot of you could never handle an even numbered fight. 
---
And heaven forbid if Horde ever outnumbered Alliance on the off chance, the griefing that took place in order for ones own medicine to be taken was Real.
---
So your saying that everyone in a raid group in a semi hardcore guild is expected to be there every predetermined raid night for as long as they plan on staying in the raid group? I have a ton of free time but stuff comes up for work now and then. 
---
Again I want to reiterate my scenario is not a regular occurrence.
---
Is it because it could be an excuse for an elven armour? Its the only armour that fits the color scheme to the elves and if you hide the helm i guess it could work.
---
Horde effectively gets threat capped eventually so I think even with WF alliance dps outscales hordes.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Ya, it was really all about lag spikes for me, not constant lag. Which I think is an issue for people's memories about how things worked, especially if we all had different experiences. When people first brought up NPC leeway in relation to hamstring kiting, I was pretty sure it was working as I remembered it (based on my own beta experience).
---
They tried to bring that back with cats, and it was immensely fun. But people complained so much after wrath being super easy that they reverted back to the old ways. I was sad when it happened.
---
&gt; Lastly topping meters as a healer means absolutely nothing it is about making the raid survive if you and your healing targets survive you have done a good job no matter where on the healing meters you are.
---
 Sounds very logical but I would think it would still feel kinda bad if you are dead last on the healing list. Raidmembers who know nothing about healing( like myself) would probably assume you did a poor job even if it's not true. Guess in a very good guild though people are more knowledgeable.
---
And your point is... because someone on youtube agrees with you, your preconceptions are vindicated?
---
I don’t think anyone played prot in classic though. You go arms with 15 in prot
---
Innverate *pls*.
---
This is a gameplay and pvp discussion bro we aren't questioning the character of the ones carrying out the actual greifing. That being said, childish or not this is a game where technically you are allowed to do such things - hurling insults at the people that did this makes 0 difference to them
---
It's kinda like phasing, except it's continent wide and only activates when the amount of users online exceeds a certain amount, i have no clue what the limit is before a new layer is created though.
---
I hate hearing about RL drama, I care about your life in Azeroth. Not if they are going to impeach Trump.
---
Sonii? Multiple Rank 1 Gladiator?
---
Nice reference!
---
What would be the alternative to that?  Force pallies to not use their best heal for the sake of the other healers?
---
Paul Stanley was the main dude that sang most of the songs too :)
---
I think people are blowing this particular issue out of proportion. After 2 months people will even forget it was a thing. But overall I agree with your last point :/ I also think Blizz want to avoid the bad press of "yet another catastrophic launch" like the wod and d3 ones.
---
I was always baffled by the average 50:50 ratio, I never understood the appeal of playing the alliance. All classes look boring and all areas expect the dwarf starting zone are boring. I levelled two 60 characters and a 110 in retail and I still don't understand. Everytime I start a new char in Horde I remember how I love Durotar. I hate the undead starting zone though.
---
Should last you long enough to get to level 7 before having to restart the video
---
Druid and alliance warlocks
---
It’s called Paralysis by Analysis. 
---
There is too much information about this game and its classes. If you search you will find something to discourage you from rolling what you want. It’s inevitable with something that’s been around for years. The reason no one can pick a main is because they know all the faults of each class and at the end of the day must choose a fault to be stuck with. Back in the day you would just roll a class because it looked cooler than the other ones or something trivial. It’s easy to grind when you have no idea what comes next. Today, everyone knows how much time it takes to get to 60 and don’t want to waste it on a class they won’t like. But then you’re stuck in Paralysis by Analysis. The only way to overcome this is to close your eyes and pick. Just do it.
---
For reddit formatting, add \ before the \# to keep it from bolding the text
---
I had 100% the exact opposite occurrence.  I've leveled two druids to 20 and tanked both times.  Each time the mages would know when and who to sheep, we made proper calls, the party flowed smoothly with only 1 wipe due to accidentally pulling greenskin.
---
Good, good. More tier sets for me.
---
100% agree. You might need an easy bake oven if you want max frame rate.
---
Okay so you’re saying that I could be in more than a casual guild with business trips as long as I communicate with the guild and am reliable outside of that?
---
Not on PvP servers
---
They're doing layering because of the bottleneck in the starting zones on launch, this would be the case with 2k or 10k. They are disabling layering when the population spreads out. Have you ever played on a vanilla server with 10k players online? You're out of your mind if you think that's what they're planning for classic.
---
the shock on my face
---
well if you want to be a "core raider" yeah you need to show up
---
now that said everyone has shit come up sometimes
---
My guild requires 85% attendance to keep your spot, so you can miss some nights 
---
now if you miss a few raids most guilds will not boot you they just put you on the bench so you are more of a fill in guy at least till your schedule is more suited to raiding.
---
This. People don't play Warlock because in endgame PvE your rotation is 2 buttons (shadowbolt and lifetap) and outside of that you are a summon/healthstone bot, requiring you to farm shards before every raid.
---
&gt; The hyper knowledgeable private server elitist who will basically yell at people in Dungeons and tell everyone what they're doing wrong before either leaving or kicking someone. Will be a tank
---
I consider myself a knowledgeable pserver "elitist", and that's exactly why I *don't* yell at my party.  Yelling at people is the fastest way to destroy the party and make people leave.  Better to show people leadership and help them learn their classes or how to respond to mechanics.
---
The attitude towards pserver players here is increasing aggro and I don't think it's justified.
---
Improved internet infrastructure has more to do with server capacities, download/upload speeds of large files, and stability, not necessarily ping. Aside from some remote areas who may have gotten more local ISP provider infrastructure, most people who already had local providers may not see that much of a difference. The only significant difference I see for ping is consistency (fewer lag spikes).
---
Took me 36 straight hours.  Then a few days later I was wondering through the common lands and that damn cyclops tripped over me.  Killed it again.  😔
---
For everything I want phase 1 I need to be in dungeons all day everyday after 60 and then farming when it’s late and I can’t form groups anymore. All good.
---
Ret was def improved with TBC, but it was the beginning of Wrath and the talent revamp that came with it that ushered in the Retadin phase of the WoW meta. I had started playing Ret near the middle of TBC, and when Wrath dropped, I was suddenly one of the highest damage dealers around. Felt nice.
---
TBC, in my experience, was dominated by hunters, warlocks and warriors, at least in a pvp/arena sense. It was a good time for a lot off specs, ele, enh, boomkin and feral were all markedly improved.
---
The armour models are shared between armour-types, the pvp sets Do the same but have like twice the details. Overall the dungeon sets, raid sets all have iconic and detailed looks whilst you compare them to the T2.5 which all have smooth surfaces with low quality textures, weird colors and misplaced spikes.
---
Also there are not a single good T2.5 helm.
---
To each is own but my opinion is obviously right.
---
It's not the tauren that he hates, it's the other melee around him that windfury crit his arse.
---
Dwarves are cool.
---
I just switched my mind from UD to Orc Warlock. I figure the only real time you'll be feared will be by priests and warriors and other warlocks. Priests and War only have 1 fear each so trinket should be enough, and PvP warlocks aren't that common on the Ally side because they have to deal with all of the WotF from the over-represented UD on the Horde side. Worst case scenario it's basically a mirror match vs a warlock...
---
On the other hand +25% stun resist is giant vs Rouges who are really popular in pvp and will be giving us the most trouble. Warrior intercepts, Pally HoJ, and all the engi nade stuns are also going to be common.
---
In most guilds it's not a problem as long as you notify people beforehand. But if you miss too many raids you will lose loot priority.
---
This. You dont need CC.
---
Gonna roll a Dwarf Paladin spec into holy, then protection.. What can I expect?
---
Because warrior already has fear break, and Orc racials are absolutely fucking retarded OP for Warrior.
---
As long as you tell people, there's no problem at all. Not even the most hardcore guilds expect 100% attendance, so just tell your officers that you'll be gone and they'll find someone to fill out your spot without too much trouble.
---
Rolling on a PVP server and streaming is asking for harassment. 
---
You should however get banned for same faction grieving because there is no pvp solution to that. Alliance interfering was fair game.
---
i healed an absurd amount of blue dungeons/ ubrs on my druid back in the day. not having a rez was very rarely an issue honestly.
---
roleplaying in wow means youre on a RP server using in-game language and fiction to communicate with other players.   I am my character is a very general statement.  Everyone who plays wow "is" their character, not in the real life sense, but in a virtual sense.
---
Makes sense, thanks for the reply.
---
I mean pretty much all the stickies on this sub are geared for newer players
---
for sure, its the graphics card and processor one needs to focus on
---
2080 or go home for classic wow
---
Depends on the guild. My most recent was a vanilla private server guild. We raided 2 nights a week for about 3-4 hours each night. We weren't hardcore by any means, but we also kept the same 40 guys around so we could clear all of MC/BWL/Ony in that time.
---
The only catch was it was Loot Council rules and raiders with 3/4 attendance averages got priority on loot. But the loot council was still a shit show 90% of the time. People kept up with it and all but we were burnt out by AQ and the guild fell apart due to that and some higher up corruption.
---
So did you do Aoe grinding in vanilla
---
I have only one on my mind. 3 words; male, undead, warlock
---
It depends on the raid / guild. It will either be a bunch of heal sniping, or you will have healing assignments.
---
Hey mate. Welcome to the community. You will have tons of fun.
---
People who need a tank are more than fine taking Druids.
---
You can argue some take it a little more seriously, as well as rp on non rp servers. Some people have backstory along with their character, some don't. But to say "I am my character" still means just that, nothing wrong with it, but that's textbook rping.
---
Am frost mage can confirm, chill af.
---
Wtf you get a token each week and you buy gear with it? Man they really broke this game didn’t they?
---
Yeah it's really crazy that people are telling new/returning players they MUST play Warrior/Rogue/Mage to DPS in a raid. I spoke to a returning player who played Ele Sham in Vanilla and he said he would only wanna go Ele Sham again but it's not viable and he won't raid. Apparently he spoke to someone on Reddit who said he wouldn't make it into any raid as an Ele Sham.
---
I've cleared all raid content bar Naxx with "unviable" comps. If you go the best comp for raids it just makes the raids boring because you just face-roll everything.
---
mind control is sooooo gooooood
---
They ended up hoping around a lot via summons from warlocks who travels places ahead of time, until they finally found some safety under Org. The limitation was that they had to go to Horde starting areas so when the Ally did eventually show up, they couldn't be PK'd. The new location doesn't prevent body trolling once those players do show up.
---
So you make some interesting suggestion and perhaps with a little more thought it could work. But wouldn't we still need to limit it to areas that are uncontested in order to prevent interference, whether natural or sniped? This can limit the amount of locations severly, and usually to zones that are all relatively close to each other.
---
Unless those players in a duel are offline up until the moment the duel starts, they can easily be located before in order to grief. Especially if the have a public bracket list and the also share the order in which the duels will take place. Then a team of greifers can organize them self with numerous alts(such as Trollgodx did yesterday to find each new location) and be ready to troll once each duel starts.
---
Back up locations sound great but won't they be faced with the same limitations? And you have to remember that any interference, naturally or not, cause completely alter the outcome if someone waste a long CD.
---
Thought?
---
Do you want to do 1 2 and 3 reasonably well to fit the needs of your guild when they need more of one of those? Congratulations, your preferred class is Druid.
---
The only exception would be mages, where you can get 50-65k exp an hour AoE grinding.

I'm not quite sure how you're supposed to fix radiations anyways.

I recommend the addon Doctor Druid so you don't do that again
---
You're talking about saving time vs being better in combat situations.
---
It's because people have found the most optimal way to do it on Pservers so now they thin Most Optimal = The only way. Which just isn't true.
---
Can confirm. Am a hyper knowledgeable veteran WoW player that plays melee dps.
---
Tri-Spec is the blackout healing spec. w/ Shadowguard.

---
It's not going to make it impossible, but it's going to make it _way_ more unlikely that you encounter the same person two days in a row.
---
Humans with their spirit boost are better PvE healing as a priest, because your warriors should be stance dancing anyway and not require fear wards.
---
Fear ward is nice, but we were clearing naxx in vanilla with 1 dwarf priest. I don't think you need a raid of them.

That camera turn just as he charges makes it seem like he just appeared dead.
---
Sometimes it is more sometimes it is less. Set dkp prices are bad.
---
Pusii
---
Plus with warstomp (tauren) and the knockdown 2h you can get some decent cc, not great or the most reliable but something.
---
Inquisitor sir, it's this post right here.
---
It's one of the worst talents in the game.
---
It only increases the base healing, and is unaffected by spellpower.
---
10% rep is just a time saver. If you're in a guild and running rep friends, all the non humans still need to run content. You'll likely overkill on rep.
---
Once you max the rep, the 10% doesn't give a benefit where stoneform is a lasting benefit to use.
---
Ya from what I've seen the beta is a giant roll fest. I would like to think they forgot to put a world wide buff to move damage on, but apparently this is blizzlike.
---
Feelsbadman
---
I assume a lot more guilds will be on the lenient side compared to back in the day. The reason I say this is because a lot of us gained some form of lives after classic, got a lot older, and now it’ll be hard to balance that with classic obligations. But yeah if you want to be a starter in the main raid group of a hardcore guild missing nights won’t fly, and it sounds like you are already planning on missing some. You shouldn’t feel guilty about it and they shouldn’t feel like they have to demote you. Just find a guild that’s right for you. I’m sure they’ll be out there
---
spamming is how you play paladin, holy doesn't have any mana issues.
---
but yeah, it isn't hard.
---
I think a periodic "long AV" would be a really fun way to keep it fresh and entertaining. Like every 3rd weekend of each month could be that version of AV. I could see a lot of PvP guilds getting super prepared for it and it being really epic. 
---
But yea if I'm choosing one permanently, its "fixed AV." I work a job and have to sleep at night, so maybe I'd like to finish an AV every now and again lol. It's still plenty epic and fun for me.
---
Hm. I dont see it, to me both dungeon set 1 and t2 are way better looks with sulfuras. But if you like it you rock it. You wont win my transmog competitions tho ;)
---
We cleared Naxx in 9 weeks and that was when we finished our first staff and before Naxx was on full farm, so your numbers are not right . So it's safe to assume on full farm it would take half that time.
---
no OP but I have the exact same schedule, playing about 8-11ish after I put the kids down.  sadly, there is no such thing as playing more on weekends just cause you're off work as your day spent with the aforementioned wife/kids and then you still just play after the kids are in bed. :)  
---
I can see this being more of a thing for folks with older kids that are more independent though, but by then you're probably less concerned about bed times and only playing after they're asleep anyways.
---
You use bracers, gloves, boots for the 3 piece. There's blues better than some of the other pieces.
---
A job is a job, just that. There are thousand of oportunities out there, waiting for you, so dont be thinking about that. Just relax, take  a year or two for thinking in you, and then keep going.
---
Just keep in mind that we work for living, and not the opposite.
---
Back in vanilla most of my team couldn't even remember to bring reagents for their buffs. We were a whole new level of casual :)
---
MC is easy regardless of the gear.  the first rag kill will be about a week after launch.
---
it will not be like "back in the day"
---
You really just like saying edge it would seem.
---
I think people are underestimating how much longer it is going to take to level on a fresh server in Classic.  The WR time of 4days 20hours was set on an Australian realm that launched well after Vanilla World of Warcraft had been out.  Joana was min-maxing the whole time and was strictly a speed-leveler, playing a Hunter.  Obviously, you can't have a 40 man raid full of Hunters and expect to be succesfull.  Your Shaman/Pallies/Priests/Warriors are going to level much slower.  NOT TO MENTION... any kind of "practice" we have had on pservers has been done with unrealistic spawn rates/drop rates for mobs and quest items.  IMO it really isn't possible for a 7 day Rag kill.... and it DEFINITELY is not sustainable.  You are going to blow your load in 7 days... but then what are you going to do for the next 5 months or however long Phase 1 lasts?  2 weeks is understandable and very respectable but I think week 1 is a bit of overconfidence.  We shall see though!
---
I was expecting this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7lp9umG2I
---
I remember the feeling of getting the first mount of vanilla wow. Riding around exploring and leveling for days. I remember I felt so free. Fantastic feeling to get in a game. A feeling I normally only get when I am out with my bike in the wilderness in real life. It was a gem. And I hope that I can get a similar feeling again in August.
---
&gt; The hyper knowledgeable veteran WoW player that will be super chill and willing to take things slow and explain to other players where they mistakes are and how to improve. Will be a tank or healer
---
13 year veteran checkin in. Imma be healin someone, but probably not til max level.
---
Quick question, can you stance dance all fears?
---
I agree. I really do.

I want to be able to quest day 1. I don't want to boot up with 500 people in each of the starting zones. I do want layering to go away in the lv 10+ zones. That's when lasting friendships happened to me.
---
you are going to get a lot of hate for this...
---
most of this reddit thinks MC is the pinnacle of classic raiding and expect it to be a challenge.  they are going to be very upset when a bunch of green geared players steam roll the raid shortly after classic releases
---
And druid but yes, you are right that they are incredibly fast.
---
They listened to Live to Win one too many times lol.
---
Nice, you made made up four different stereotypes that don't necessarily exist in reality.
---
The boss needs to attack the user, so you just have the tank use it.
---
Sorry about your health. Keep your health as your #1 priority and hopefully WoW can help you relax and recover!
---
Looking for Belgian (Flemish) players, to team up with / guild or if there's a specific server that Flemish people will be joining, please let me know.
---
We frost mages are always chill
---
Yeah i mean do you give it to MT and OT's (assuming tank swaps), or just MT?
---
Again, just what do you think layering is? Server will have 10k+ at launch with a layer per X amount of players. As the majority of the tourists start to leave, layers will be reduced accordingly until the server reaches its stable population within 1-2 months and there is only the 1 layer.
---
Don't throw a bitchfit about a mechanic when you don't even understand what it is lol. Layers aren't channels and they aren't sharding. They're the equivalent of CPU cores.
---
Agree here. NO reason to layer zones past 10+ because the casuals will drop when they die the 20th time to a kobold.
---
Well idk about that, most of the "ONLY THIS CLASS/SPEC" has actually been on here
---
On the actual Pservers, there's rets and boomkins with naxx gear
---
I think it's actually a *retail* thing that's permeated into the mindset for other games, which is sad.
---
In retail certain specs outperform their weaker alternatives by 10% or more of the dps / hps etc, while in classic/vanilla your class wasn't completely changed or altered or buffed based on your spec. A shadow priest can still toss out heals, a ret can pick up aggro for a minute if he needed to etc
---
Retail feels like everything is a one trick pony and to deviate from your specific class guidelines is blasphemous and outrageous!
---
Most guilds require like a 70-ish % attendance but you can always talk to the guild about it, and it's completely okay if you miss a raid as long as you make it known in advance. If you don't say anything and then show up late, then THAT is an issue.
---
As a forsaken, you all suck and I would cannibalize you first chance I get!
---
Pretty sure they both got fixed at the same time and yeah, that's the strat undead horse!
---
In my decade on private realms I agree,, 90% of people are friendly kind and helpful, its just the vocal 10% that tarnish the community..
---
You think a 5 minute cooldown is going to stop someone from layer hopping away from a ganker? Remember that this is vanilla. Half that time goes to the corpse-run.
---
Yeah but I think wlocks not having +shadow damage from tailoring makes classic more balanced, They have a pet after all, soulstones, healthstones, Life Tap, Free mount at 40, they are hard to compete with in terms of efficiency, They are already way ahead of mages in terms of levelling so by adding a ton of +shadow dmg gear ontop they would be insane. Mages +frost gear kind of increases the efficiency in some cases, but I've been lucky enough to grab Robes of Argul and I dont think swapped out those robes for +11 Frost makes it worth while, bcus I'd lose a bunch of Int and more importantly Spirit, which makes levelling a lot more efficent.
---
A lot of classes have to waste space, not just warlocks. I think it more so has to do with the fact that there aren't nearly as many ally warlocks as there are horde.
---
Hey man, just wanted to let you know that if you’re from Europe, and playing from a EU server id talk to you anytime, about whatever dude! I have no illness such as yours, but you generally seem like a nice guy to talk to! If you ever wanna meet up in Azeroth let me know. :)
---
Play classic alone without her. There is great comfort when you have complete freedom in a game. Only yourself to think about. Take you life back mate!!!
---
Yeah let's be real. The tourists won't even reach lv 20. They'll die 8 times in some cave, quit and never come back.
---
It's kind of like a bad dream. They're sharding the entire 1-60 experience of the Vanilla recreation. They're going to shuffle the player base between small pools every login and torpedo the possibility of a community on this megaserver to help the players? And some people are defending it and saying that it's necessary? It's truly a surreal thing. I'm trying to figure out if someone up-high is trying to sabotage the project, as there is obvious effort to get things right. I don't think properly colored lamp posts or spell batching matter to me if the entire 1-60 is sharded though.
---
don't recommend it to the average player at all
---
I agree, I do see a lot more of this on Reddit, but there are a ton of new players to the pservers since classic is getting closer and you can see them just repeating whatever is the hot reddit topic that day in world chat acting like they are veteran players :)
---
Layer only the starting areas, than none passed that.
---
I've seen some zero sum DKP systems work really well for guilds.
---
&gt;its just the vocal 10% that tarnish the community..
---
Just like most communities. Private server players are also the reason we're getting vanilla. The proof of concept happened there, so I don't understand the hate towards them.
---
I played as a rogue in vanilla, and been trying out mainly druid (among other classes) on private servers, and frankly I'm 99% sure I'm gonna pick it.
---
Yes, you won't have the insane burst damage (albeit with lucky crits it's almost the same at times) or stunlocking.
---
But the rest - oh boy. Pick and choose battles with stealth. Heal people from out of nowhere. Much higher amount of survivability when things go wrong. Make enemy rogues regret their life choices with faerie fire + bear armor + nature's grasp. Run instances as tank, healer or dps at will. \*Stealth\* run those instances too.
---
Yes, rogue is fun, but it's only marginally different even between specs and it gets old doing the same thing over and over.
---
Druid is a bit of everything according to what the situation demands or what you feel like.
---
The problem is that if it launches with layering, it's already too late.
---
What happens when we're two months in and the servers are still at 20k population? They can't disable layering then. This is something that has to be addressed before that happens.
---
Another non-argument from someone who never played a private server in his life.
---
I mean i guess for fights you have it on both, it's not really a big deal since the pot is incredibly cheap as arthas tears is a otherwise useless herb and blindweed is usually like 4-5gold a stack
---
...hard old school mmo? Interesting take since WoW was competing against just that when it launched as the casual friendly option.
---
The way OP describes it "farming heroic dungeons" leads me to believe he's referring to Valor points which could be earned by competing PvE content like dungeons and raiding, they were used to buy/upgrade gear. They were removed in MoP over two expansions ago so this isn't exactly a thing retail players do anymore either. The closest thing would probably be the weekly mythic plus dungeon chest but that can technically be done in a single dungeon run.
---
I have a full-time job, GF, and generally go out on weekends and I still plan to play a lot more than 20 hrs a week comfortably. When gaming is your primary hobby it's not hard to figure out how they spend so much time on it.
---
Oh? So you were not the worst of the healers?
---
You were viable in feral or balance?
---
It was never a problem to do dungeons without a rez?
---
Sorry, innervated self.
---
an inconvenience worth having vs all the other exploits that inconvenience others.
---
What about sidegrade items? Or resistance items? No one wants to spend a week of dkp on that
---
People love this kind of garbage. It's like the Reddit version of those facebook/ ads where they say "what kind of XXX are you? Take our quiz now"
---
Maybe the bad player is the one trying to raid heal when there are Paladin's already doing it fine?
---
a lot of raids will bring a hybrid shadow/healer spec for shadow weaving.  since shadow priests do no damage some raids will use a healing priest for shadow weaving.
---
i doubt this spec will be any good at pvp though
---
Well, I will be pleasantly surprised when AQ40 and then Naxx are cleared within 2 hours with no deaths by ppl week one.
---
Words, sounds, fancy noises expressed through text on a forum, I'm smart, you're dumb. - REDDIT
---
No offense, just want a healthy discussion. But with what do you disagree? I'm unsure.
---
Everything you said I totally agree with. I never claimed their use in the total amount of druids in a raid setting nor their utility. On the contrary, I am exactly in the situation with my officers right now where we are discussing these points for our raid roster. On our last PS we had boomkins, shadow priests, elemental shamans, enhancement shamans, feral dps and feral tank, I went smite DPS on off-nights and our main-tank often went dualwield for shits and giggles. 
---
I have nothing against these specs, merely wanted to point out that from an "efficiency" point of view (anywhere from semi-hardcore to full tryhard min-maxing) you will set a certain threshold for these types of classes. You can apply them for your entire guild on all raids, or just during raid **progression**. We can both agree that for many "semi-hardcore" guilds there will be a difference. For progression you can (not necessarily) minimize the amount of "non-meta" specs (or however you want to describe the specs). I don't think it's a bad idea as a general rule of thumb, to limit these specs only to 1 or 2 spots per raid as a guideline. More spots open up for these specs organically when your raid/guild progresses with epic gear.
---
Many many many bugs. Remember the gate-trap with the insects / grubs in Stratholme? That shit is a death trap on my pserver.
---
My raid guild ran with 12 paladins, both ret and holys abound.  We didnt make Naxx but we did okay for ourselves.
---
Layering is literally doing all of that already, except every time you log in you end up on a new server.
---
Allimania anyone?
---
Its less about price of pot and more about loss of resistance from not using Juju (which shares guardian elixir slot, but gives +resistance).
---
I guess for 3min fights you can usually handle it with just MT having it. Although it does suck having MT have less resistance.
---
#  &lt;Coup&gt; | NA |Alliance | PvE Server | Middlecore Raiding | Fri/Sat Evenings PST (exact days/times TBD)
---
About Us:
---
&lt;Coup&gt; is a guild with almost 15 years of history, originally formed in vanilla on the Shadowsong-US server. Coup was a top raiding guild on the server during vanilla, scoring several server firsts across BWL and AQ40, including server first Nefarian. Since then we’ve stuck together through almost every expansion with a fairly consistent core of 15-20 members, and are looking to ramp our numbers up to have a healthy community in classic, as well as to support the 40 man raid scene.
---
I’m referring to Coup as “Middlecore” because we plan to raid, but won’t likely push hard on bleeding edge progression. We will always welcome a wide variety of players and playstyles. This ranges from people who always want to play at the top of their game, all the way through to those who want to take the scenic route through the game.
---
Due to the nature of 40 man raiding we will need some consistency in the raid roster, but we also place no pressure on our people when real life happens. If you need to take a sabbatical from raiding or the game in general, we may backfill your role, but the guild will still be here and you will still be a member when you get back. We’ve always treated this game as part of our hobby and not a job, and we’ve been able to maintain many of the same friends and guild members for over a decade as a result. We hope that in Classic we can maintain that M.O.
---
What we are looking for:
---
* We want to build a community first, and then our raiding team later. More than anything we want to find like-minded adults who want to enjoy the game with us.
---
* At some point (ideally around or before content Phase 2) we would like to get the point where we are able to consistently clear current content while it is current.
---
What are aren’t looking for:
---
* Toxicity, racism, bigotry, homophobia, or other generally awful behavior. During the Blizzcon opening ceremony Chris Metzen always used to end with a saying; “Be good to each other”… We intend to do just that, and invite people that will conduct themselves in a positive manner.
---
If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to me via DM here on Reddit, or via discord @ Evilmonstar#7541.
---
Thanks for reading, and we can’t wait to see you in Classic!
---
&gt;I'd like to see how hunters play on classic and how all the macros we depend on hold up with the modern code.
---
Not sure the beta is a great example of that in its current state. It's also being shut down soon, so we probably won't see a version of hunter without all the bugs :/
---
hence why they should lower the maximum cost of respecs.  it will make the pvp scene much healthier population wise
---
I've never played Horde. All of those quests are unknown to me. I'd be tempted just to see what their quests are like. 
---
For instance, last night my 42 druid was running through Ashenvale and I saw 2 horde on a little hill in the Furborg area. I will misspell everything here. Anyway, they had a little horde flag planted and it looked like they were defending the hill from waves of Furborgs. 
---
I stood there watching, helping out with some spells every now and then. Then something called a Captain spawned and hit me, my thorns hurt him, and I think I tagged him. I assume he was part of their quest so I ran away to make him forget about me and let them tag him.
---
Ran back to check on them to see if they got credit for it but some asshole NE hunter had killed them both while they were fighting waves and was just sprinting away.
---
Which is a shame, I wanted to see what that ending was going to be like.
---
Half of what I posted was a joke. Sorry if I offended you.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/dilly\_wow](https://www.twitch.tv/dilly_wow) OG God tier Hunter
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/bean](https://www.twitch.tv/bean)  Another PVPer from I believe the classic days.
---
I also main MM hunter since WotLK and will be streaming classic but I'm a random so no worries there me brudda. See you in the game!
---
what does this accomplish other than spread the required healing between more bodies? it doesn't make any beneficial sense.
---
if you have two healers unable to perform because 'bad' healers won't give them room then you're running too many healers.
---
imagine dieing because the paladin didn't want to snipe another healer.
---
oh wow... Now I understand the frustration. Holy shit this is dumb.
---
You’re a very stable genius.
---
So this is the video that I am referencing, he did not loot two chests in a row, but he went to a layer (somehow, I don't know how)
---
Does the racial share the cool down in vanilla? I thought that was a change they brought in later.
---
Orc has +25 stun resist? I'll be honest I've not played WoW in a while and never played horde. Lol.
---
I fell off in wotlk but feral/ret was insane 2v2, I remember there being an UD rogue in my battle group named “Retpally”, they were so op.
---
People don't have issue with private server players but rather a specific subset of them. It's the toxic "elitist" part that people have issues with. The people who come in and say "if you play night elf you're retarded". The people who throw a bitchfit because someone is having fun as an oomkin or a ret pally or an enh shaman. The people who demand that everyone min max their characters.
---
WoW is a video game and should be played in the way that is fun for people. Nearly every class combination brings something to the table, whether it be the innervate from the chickens or the totems from shamans. Vanilla raiding was more about having 40 bodies than having 40 specific specs finely tuned to obliterate the bosses. I personally will be pushing for a competitive build/spec and pushing my character to the limit. I won't be looking down on others for not choosing to play in the same manner though.
---
2 rest and 2 feral (one for tank group and 2-3fights per raid, one for boosting main dps)
---
You will use more than you will use hunters and they are so many.
---
I mean the "Pserver players are notoriously bad"
---
Try a power infusion disc/holy build. I ran that on my alt, did the rank 11 PvP grind with it. It's fun popping PI and a trinket to get some big holy fire crits.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrshiaobxtMcb something along this. Can move around if you want more focus on damage vs raid heal.
---
Here's a PvPriest video I saw back in vanilla, a guy named Beckon, not me.
---
https://youtu.be/x_EgBtUtWBM
---
There are drawbacks to every system and ways to compliment them to make it work.  If you just look for the flaws every system has them.  ZSDKP and SK have problems with small upgrades.  LC has problems with favoritism/resentment.  DKP has problems with loot allocation.  There's ways to compliment the systems to make it work for your guild by applying an ounce of common sense.  
---
If you just look to complain there will always be something to complain about.
---
AFAIK the Outlaw Sabre quest is Horde only.
---
&gt;No offense, just want a healthy discussion. But with what do you disagree? I'm unsure.
---
I know u don't mean any offense, but just go back and read the first line of the comment I was replying to??
---
It literally says (paraphrasing) "I dont disagree with you but druids are not that in demand compared to priests " or something along these lines, forgive me if I was a couple words off.
---
I don't agree with this statement. I think guilds will struggle to find a good healing druid and I think people are underestimating how great diversity of classes is in vanilla for the different utility / buffs.
---
Now, with all this said, I don't want to give the notion I'm saying paladins and priests are not the best. They are. Paladin buffs alone propel them to God tier. I just think people are sleeping on druids they are fucking amazing . This is coming from a mage, I have no bias.
---
Too much population are currently trained that your character can solo 10 mobs and you dont need communication in a group.  Yes its going to be brutal in the first month.  But those who forge ahead make the lasting friendships.  Say you do a deadmines group,  mostly its shit,  you guys wipe alot and it takes hours to finish.  But you really clicked with one guy,  hes now on your friends list and a go-to for the next dungeon. These types of things always used to happen and created very tight group circles.
---
Horde has the shaman tranquil air totem which does the same in a party
---
Active, planned-in-advance server merges also prevent realms from dying.
---
I disagree, I like that the current system makes you make difficult choices about what to spec
---
you cant just change willy nilly
---
I'm sorry you wasted so much time writing that, but you've managed to miss the point of Layering entirely. It's not the level 60s creating new layers, it's all the level &lt;10s. The people creating the layers aren't the same as the people who can abuse them.
---
clever.
---
Maybe I missed something. How is his family business connected to WoW again?

No kidding. Running to the back right for engineering in SW is annoying. IF's has a wheel design, like Undercity. Very useful.

**Pantheon** | NA PvP | Horde | US East/Central | Dedicated Raiding
---
**About Us:**   
---
Pantheon is a Horde guild that will be forming on a PvP server when WoW Classic goes live on August 27th, 2019. The core of our guild is a group of friends that have been playing MMO’s and various other games together since the early 2000’s. We’re looking for mature raiders that are willing to progress through all the content WoW Classic has to offer. Our primary focus will be on PvE/raiding, but if you’re mostly interested in PvP, there will be officers heavily involved in that as well.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Tuesday/Sunday/Monday - 8:30-11:30 EST
---
We will be running dungeons, attunement chains, and any other quests to help everyone get pre-raid best in slot prior to raiding.
---
**Loot:**
---
We will be using a loot council system for raid gear that drops. In our opinion, loot council is the best way to gear a guild for progression through every raid tier. The loot council will contain the GM and all class officers. We will be using the following priority: Tanks -&gt; DPS/Heals. Please understand that you will not get gear every run; however, if you’re consistently raiding with the guild, you will be rewarded gear to help with our progression.
---
**Other Info:**
---
Although we will be pushing for progression, we're not going to be making world buffs mandatory.  I would like to experience the content without using world buffs, as I feel they make a significant impact on the difficulty of raids.
---
**Contact:**
---
If interested, please direct message me through Reddit, for now.  We're in the process of setting up our discord.
---
Yeah no for sure
---
I'd fall under this category haha I by no means am a vanilla PS veteran, but I'll have slightly more experience going into classic than most people which is why I leveled a toon on ND so close to launch, I wanted to familiarize myself with the content again.
---
its close at least.
---
Kevin Jordan talks about this a bit on stream sometimes... he set 6 classes as the limit for each race to maintain racial identity. Since humans can sort of be anything (other than druids/shamans) it was a bit of a toss up on which class was excluded.
---
# &lt;AlphaPhase&gt; Horde | NA-PvP | semi-hardcore 
---
**Recruiting all classes &amp; specs** 
---
**Raid schedule** \- two days \[1\]main raid Sunday 7-10:30pm \[2\]progression raid Wed. 8-10:30pm EST 
---
**Loot system** \- DKP + LC (made up of council + rotating members w/ list transparency available pre raid) 
---
**Intro**: The foundation of AP was a group of friends that love video games, raunchy banter, tacos, beer, and cannot wait for Classic’s release! Welcoming everyone – from the most experienced to ‘I’ve never played WoW before’. While we will be progressive in PvE content, it will be at our pace (we all have lives: careers, families, school, etc.). Will also have scheduled WPvP &amp; BGs events - because who doesn’t enjoy killing gnomes. 
---
**Expectations**: **For any member it is to have fun and enjoy the game!** Aimed at those wanting to raid, the expectation is to meet the raid schedule, come prepared with BiS/pots, and know the fights (or at least do some research beforehand).

But not tanking is very frequently tantamount to also not doing a dungeon because you're going to be waiting on finding one. It's obviously justified if you're playing a class that's literally incapable of it, but why would someone want to wait around for an extra 30 minutes to ??? when they could instead speed things up for themselves and also four other people?
---
Like you know 5 mans are just a grindy type thing right? There's stuff after that that people need shit from the 5 mans for and it's to literally everyone's benefit to get through the 5 mans as quickly as possible. I like hitting shit in dungeons too but I also like not wasting my own time.
---
Also I take a policy similar to the warrior that replied to me before, let the dime a dozen kiddos who are too afraid to tank because that's too much responsibility for them wait all they like (that's what they actually mean whenever they say they 'cant' or 'dont' tank, btw). I'd let a warrior who's willing to tank but requesting no other warriors in the group in 100%, even if it's for specifically warrior DPS loot, just as a matter of principle.
---
Like.. thank you for valuing the time of your prospective group members. Absolutely you can have all the warrior gear, based warrior who has a shield and isn't an absolute vagina. Oh look at that, I already found replacements for both of those fury warriors while I was typing my thank you.
---
I loved TBC just for that pendent quest to get Undead lady to sing to me.

I also wouldn't necessarily describe wow-classic as "hard".
---
I mean it really depends on what you are going to do.
---
If your goal is to beat Kel'Thuzad, the final raid-boss, then yes that's probably quite the challenge.
---
If you just somehow want to get to level 60 and do some of the things you can do there, then the difficulty is entirely dependent on how you do it and what you end up doing.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/KIT3MNh8I
---
That's Classic.
---
Assuming you want lootboxes instead...?
---
Good observation!
---
I think it looks good, the thing that is off about is is the headpiece imo. Without the headpiece the set looks good.
---
Sure, but burried in there was some weird and useful stuff. Summoning returns!
---
I’m really looking forward to not having weekly quotas or to-do lists generally.
---
Erm, I agree Warlocks can survive far better but efficency? AoE frost farming is the best thing for that! You can do entire quests in a single batch.
---
I wouldn't say I'm hyper-knowledgeable, but I fit 2 pretty well. Almost certainly going to end up healing, and I was patient with noobs back then anyway, so I expect I can be just as patient now.
---
Rank 14 is even more playtime. But up to rank 10 wasn't too bad. I worked full-time during Vanilla, didn't have a premade and still got rank 11 and the pvp-mounts.
---
I missed 90% of this tourney but tuned in for the last few rounds of the losers brackets and the final duels.  My favorite part of these tournaments by far is watching Venruki's duels.  He really pushes his class to the limits and provides clear commentary on why he did things he did and even when he loses has a really good attitude.  I particularly enjoyed his duels against Cdew in the Asmon tournament (which was a horrible attempt at a tourney).  Looking forward to watching some of these duels on youtube later. 
---
I love that the streamers are running events like this and hope things like this happen once Classic fully launches.  These sort of player driven events are the only reason I would ever consider intentionally rolling on a streamer server, as I think it really adds to the community, though I hope to maybe see more non-streamers showcased in the future.  Let's show off the players on your server not just host a big advertising event for fellow streamers.
---
 Classic isn't Northdale bro LOL
---
Why is it different for horde?
---
It depends on if people are rushing AV or not.
---
If people are, it doesn't matter how skilled you are. Only how often you do AV. If people are not rushing AV it matters how skilled you are because the good premade won't let you in if you're shit and are letting the team down.
---
As far as it only taking time to do, well there's items like the Lionheart Helm which are BiS for literally the entire of classic and they're just a matter of time too.
---
No, obviously a system that rewards skilled players and not only people how are able to grind 10+ hours a day.
---
yeah i watched it back a few times and it's quite weird how the camera twitch is at the exact moment he charges!
---
the lower respec cost doesn't change your identity.  in a lot of cases it enhances the ID.
---
the people wanting to play a non viable raid spec will be able to obtain gear for that spec. the ret pallies and enhancement shamans will have good gear for this spec.  i personally had ID of a nf/conflag warlock despite raiding a proper ds/ruin spec (i been playing on a server with lower respec costs)
---
"who is a PVP guy" why should people who raid not be able to pvp. anyone who pvps would agree that a larger player pool is a good thing
---
Yeah this works. As a disc priest in retail I couldn’t survive without this type of stuff. Pretty much never target allies.
---
Bringing 40 healthstones, one to trade to each player...
---
Yes but you scale well so that changes. Warlocks are good in aq40 and naxx.
---
As far as blizzard dealing with greifers goes, I think the spirit of the game should really be considered. 
---
If it's an alliance rogue constantly killing people after duels? Dick move, but not ban worthy.  
---
Those people making level 1 taurens simply to stand over players and greif their own faction? I'd be fine with blizzard giving temporary bans when there's evidence for it. 
---
For the streamers/streamer's fans that are calling for alliance to be banned, go back to BFA lol.
---
Thats why you go casual, and take all the badass pala tierset and use them instead of peasent cloth shit and look like a fucking BALLER
---
Missing paladin buffs.
---
Well one thing to note, with some items it can be worth it to hold then for a while, prices well go up if you wait
---
Actually, Hardcore Progression Raiding (with the excempt of split raiding) is probably the way to go with a tight schedule in Classic. Good guilds will easily clear multiple raids in one evening during farm. You will only have to sacrifice some of your time in the week for consumable farming. It's much better time efficiency then raiding in a 2-3 day casual guild.
---
Fishing without animal cruelty?
---
... Idk
---
Better late than never, right 8))
---
tauren and night elf should've been their own hippy commune faction with druids as their faction exclusive race
---
IIRC, yes.  Corehounds are considered exotic pets and were not able to be tamed in Classic.
---
You can do something called totem twisting, which means dropping Wf totem and then immediately Tranquil air. End result: 8.5/10seconds windfury and also almost constantly tranquil air if needed (besides one global cooldown). 
---
Besides that: most raids have enough shamans for the above to not even be needed in a 40man. Totems are just really good, as are resto shamans. One tranquil air totem for top4 caster group, for minus threat is more then enough. 
---
(At least, that’s what I’ve done in vanilla in multiple guilds and raids like MC/bwl etc)
---
&gt; You shapeshift, shred, if you get an omen of clarity proc, shred again. If you do, you'll have enough energy for a 3rd shred. Now you're out of energy. Shapeshift back into human form and to cat again. 60 energy. Repeat until you run out of mana, using pots and innervate.
---
That sounds awful :D But I will definitely try it if I get my druid to 60 sometime at the end of the year :D
---
Oh duh, of course. Thanks.
---
It does as people are able to spec bounce all the time. At any rate it's moot anyway.
---
salt over what? you being shit at the games and using some random excuses to justify it? lmao
---
I think that tank with 2h is fine if the tank isn't taking damage too fast and the healer isn't running oom.
---
If you don't need to worry much about damage mitigation, the increased dps and threat output would be nice.
---
Be me.  Retail player.  Joined sub 2 months before launch.  Post about how layering is a necessary evil and to trust Blizzard.  Blizzard takes out layering because of those vanilla fans stuck in their ways.  Launch happens.  See servers that are Full, High, Medium population.  Try to join "Full" server because my favorite streamer is there. Pop-up warning me there will be possible queues and overcrowding if creating a character on a High or Full server.  Proceed anyways.  Get stuck in queue for 20 minutes.
---
"SEE TOLD YOU LAYERING WAS NECESSARY."
---
oodm
---
What’s up with all the downvoters in this sub? This dude is having fun doing real world pvp that I for one am stoked about. There is literally no reason to downvote this person.
---
Also, who was leading the raid? He was entertaining af
---
They are in the park near the moonpool i think.
---
I get it, even if I don't share it. I dabbled on pservers myself back in the day, but most of my interactions with pserver players have been on reddit. I think part of the image issue is how pserver players discuss the game with non-pserver players. When you are knowledgeable and invested in something like that, there is a disconnect when you talk to people who aren't into it in the same fashion. It's an easy enough communication barrier to overcome with humility, but humility seems to be in short supply.
---
That sounds more like WoW retail then. 
---
Your post isn't going to do anything here. This is the way PvP was 15 years ago. Times change.
---
You can, but AoE farming probably won't be as prevalent in classic due to Leeway being a thing, only experienced/skilled AoE farmers will be able to do it without dying frequently.

**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** Horde - NA – PvP – Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. Lately we’ve been on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of our team.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. We are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We also anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP.
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.

Kasualty#3759, Spartda#7299, Stolas#6827
---
Never said most people quit. Just that it was bad PR for blizzard and they would like yo avoid it especially now. And top players will have to abuse layering for higher level zones right? Because the high value resources are there. Correct me if I'm wrong tho. And layering will mostly be happening in high pop zones which will be zones around capitals and starting zones. Also prises are always massively inflated at the start of every expansion and normalise after a few months.
---
Will check it out, thanks!
---
I wonder if the old metas will be a thing, like tanks being only prot warriors and most druids being resto, or if people will actually manage to do endgame content with other classes and specs.
---
The beauty of the pre-merge solution is that you don't have to predict how populations will equalize. Pick large enough groups, then based on actually observing the population level off of your various sub-servers you can merge them on an as-needed basis. 
---
The problem with treating them all as layers within one server is back to your initial issue, who knows how the server will stabilize. If classic is successful, you can't get rid of the layers. With keeping the servers completely separate to start and then only merging as population decline requires, you can defer decisions to the last possible minute when you have maximal data.
---
&gt; What constitutes grieving can be difficult. In example, dying on purpose to Kazzak (if you were not part of the raid) was considered grieving. I know it because I reported several people during our attempts for doing so and a GM spoke with them and warned them.
---
If it was another same-faction guild trying to wipe your raid so that they could attempt the boss would you consider it grieifing? How do you know for certain that the people grieifing weren't delaying your raid until theirs was ready?
---
Warlock and mage should go way down there's nothing desirable about scrolling your mousewheel at 2000rpm to get lower downtime on frostbolt/fireball/shadowball spamming
---
Do we also suck in BWL and ZG? Sorry if I'm annoying you with those questions but I'm a total classic noob
---
Nice.
---
You may have convinced me to roll a druid. Crazy!
---
Is this approach viable in world pvp? I don't expect to get into serious competitive pvp.
---
Butt fuck
---
Damn candle thieves, good riddance.
---
Not 100% sure what he's referring to but it could be Seals that they introduced in MoP. You can use them to get a bonus loot roll on Dungeon, Raid and World bosses. Not exactly "free" gear but still.
---
If that's why you're playing druid, you're making a huge mistake lol
---
Speed runner Joana is currently streaming their hunter run on twitch
---
Yeah more handy to the raid, not the lock :p
---
You still gotta run out to summon everytime and tell people to click coz they're always afk doing who knows what.
---
&gt; Can we compare long term stream snipers with players who would harass another player for weeks/months?
---
Yes, if they harass a streamer for weeks/months.  Harassing a streamer for a few hours is not worth more time because they are a streamer.
---
Not very in my experience both in vanilla and pservers.
---
[Twitch.tv/sonii](https://Twitch.tv/sonii) was leading it
---
There's just a ton of people on this Reddit that want to show each other up with their "knowledge" of the game. I make jokes and get walls of text from guys that don't seem to have any sense of humor at all. So I kind of understand. It could just be the format of Reddit honestly.
---
I didn't mind being the champion so much.
---
 Your character had done a lot by that point so it was fine.  It was bearable up until after WotLK. Then it became silly lorewise
---
Sounds like crones to me. But again, this is Dr. Reddit speaking.
---
a skilled player in trash gear can beat an unskilled player in the best gear.
---
if you only give the best gear to the skilled players that just furthers the gap between skilled and unskilled, if you give the best gear to the people who need to play 10+ hours a day at least they stand a chance
---
Now that Bloodelves won't be in the game, I'm gucci.
---
You'll farm AD revered just to enter naxx at a reasonable price.
---
It's probably different now but back then each healer would heal their own group first and then raid heal if there group was full health , main tank would get an extra healer in there group to focus them. 
---
Sometimes it's fight specific , take patchwerk , the raid takes no damage in that fight (apart from warlocks but you ignore them) so you assign 3 healers per tank (5 or 6 tanks) and 4 for the main tank. 
---
4 horseman was weird as well each tank was assigned a healer who would follow them. And each group had it's own healer as well. 
---
And fights like Cthun you just have to make sure you spread all the healers around so you have no deadzone where nobody can get healed as the raid is spread out.
---
You can only hold 1 HS of each rank at a time I think
---
Yeah possibly, it's certainly the most "Kalimdor"-themed, which is where the elves are from. Anyhow, I'm a big fan although I can see why a lot of people don't like it.
---
No. See: Nef.
---
Classic never was all about skill, pve or pvp
---
It was mostly time, effort, and knowledge 
---
Skill was but one factor
---
And that's a reason I love it
---
If I wanted an all skill game I'd play a shooter or something.
---
In every guild I've been in since vanilla, their requirement was to be on at least 15 to 30 mins early, grab what you need to grab, and be at the instance by raid time. They always considered "raid time" to be when the first pull starts. For some reference, I raided in pretty casual guilds (1-2 nights a week, 3 hour raids) to hardcore guilds (3-4 nights a week, 4-5 hour raids) and this was always an applied rule.
---
I believe we were promised the vanilla experience, warts and all.  Give us the fucking warts.
---
Sure, but eventho you're outplaying people with better gear there's no way for you to get it - Since you get no rewards if you don't play more than 8 hours.
---
the people who will use this will be people who want to pvp and raid. so their ID will be whatever spec they pvp as.  i know from experience that the vast majority of people will only pvp in one spec.  
---
it seems like the people really against this are the ones who want to pvp but wont be raiding.  they dont want people with good gear joining battlegrounds.  i know this change will greatly improve the pvp scene :)
---
Yeah even in retail, I group up all of the time when leveling to get stuff done or if too many enemy faction players are around but it's always just a short group, couple of quests and people are off on their way to do their own thing.
---
In vanilla? I remember at least 4-5 people I played with for hours and hours after a random day of questing together.  I had a populated friends list of 'randoms' all through vanilla. I don't have anyone on my friends list in retail now :(
---
Oh yes for sure. If it's purely for classic gaming than anything above 16 or maybe even 8gb is overkill.
---
Layering is the entire world right now. Sharding is zone by zone. All current information out right now says layering will NOT be restricted to certain zones/levels. 
---
So the people that rush to max level will have less competition due to there being fewer high levels, but they will also have the ability to hop between all the different layers on the server.
---
Hmm I think you just convinced me to go human.
---
I probably come across that way sometimes on this sub, but I'm really just trying to share my experience/knowledge. I try to be humble. I had my time for pride as a Retadin in TBC/Wrath. It was nice, but also really alienating. I'm just excited for another go at Classic.
---
My post will start discussions which makes me see how other people reacts to how the pvp system works - maybe it will change my negative mind on it? :))
---
Do not remove layering
---
You mean times don't change, if you want it something old to remain the same.
---
Well it's not happening luckily
---
haha that is true, I usually never help when I see the guy has initiated fight knowing that I am around and hoping that I help (without asking first)
---
Back in the day I got rank 11 only playing 3 or so hours a day. We will see in classic though.
---
This isn't true  
---
Last I did this live was cata, with a latency of 22-25 ms. It was never a latency issue.  
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/spell=53/backstab#comments](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=53/backstab#comments) Ohera commented on this in 3.3.2. I could cite much more proof but you people don't seem to care about that.
---
It was never a bug, it was clever usage of game mechanics imo, and the most fun way to level a rogue, however inconvenient the weapon progression was.
---
I revel in the irony of people who apparently never tried anything interesting as a rogue, let alone play it before the backstab rework, and flooding forums saying ''We don't want your buggy private exploits, educate yourself.''  
---
It had always been in the game.
---
Seems like two people have not played vanilla in a while.
---
Okay.. druid for dueling are b aswell I suppose.
---
He's not talking about getting gold for classic, though. They're saying to buy tokens on retail by proxy trading gold from classic to retail. If you're gonna buy gold to buy a token, you might as well just pay the $15 sub. I guarantee that there will be sites dedicated to converting classic gold =&gt; retail so classic players can buy game time with tokens.
---
I’m excited that epics will be actually epic rather than handed out to even the most casual of players. BC brought in the handouts and why I quit so many years ago. Just because you finished last in a race doesn’t mean you get an award!
---
Oh I'll edit it thanks. I wasn't 100% sure.
---
I can't imagine how many tanks are going to bypass CC and target marking because they think this is retail and get wrecked.

Looking for Raiding Guild

Region: NA

Faction: Alliance

Server Type: PVE

Times Available:

Sunday - Thursday: 0700-1100 EST
---
Friday - Saturday: 1800-1100(next day)  EST
---
Roles in Order of Preference: Warr Tank, Warr DPS, Mage DPS
---
Experience: Offtank and heals from ICC through Cata
---
I'm living in NZ and work the late shift, hence the wild availability. Fridays (my Saturday) I'll be available anywhere in the stated hours, but I don't expect be raiding the entire time. I'd prefer two nights Sun - Thurs and one night Fri - Sat
---
I've played WoW casually since late TBC and have done some semi-serious raiding in Wrath and Cata.
---
&gt;The whole persistence and seeing the same people all the time doesn’t actually start to hit you until you’ve been level capped and sitting in org or sw playing the AH or forming groups, which take time.
---
I strongly disagree with the above.  I cant even count the amount if times I would meet a player in a starting zone,  then encounter him again and group up with him for an elite quest in the next zones,  then join a dungeon run a week later to find him healing it.  The leveling process is an absolutely pivotal time for forming these types of vital and immersive social connections and layering is going to destroy it.
---
For what it’s worth, don’t presume the proc and resist rates work perfectly on private servers.
---
I played horde in Vanilla and it's been my primary every since. I want to give alliance a go this time but one of my friends is a holdout.
---
I'm still going to roll alliance no matter what, it would just be nice if it was alongside my main room (which I'm going to level with my friends, whichever faction they choose).
---
You're missing the point in my harassment example, and this can happen over long periods of time. A more thorough explanation would be:
---
Greifer finds out players locations, he ganks them and camps their body til that aforemention help shows up. This particular interaction is done for that time frame. But then he does it again tomorrow and the next day, each time require your friends to show up in order to go back to playing normally.
---
This guy continues to locate that player every day or numerous times in a day thru means that aren't natural(faction spy or alternative account to /who). Sure each interaction can be dealt with but at what point do you draw the line, if any?
---
Miracoli &lt;3
---
Wait, what!? 
---
Haha as if I didn't know this. You're a genius.
---
yeah that was my theory
---
I totally get it. Thanks for the response.
---
This was sharding that was offered and the community had an uproar. Since everyone cried they came up with a new solution, layering which puts entire continents on one shard.
---
Bring on the queues...it's not like they weren't there in the stress tests anyways.
---
There was a guild on emerald dream called Gnomers who would only recruit gnomes for permade wsg and ab. Being a gnome made of course I joined and playing bgs was hilarious.
---
**[EU-PVE German] &lt;plaGue&gt; [Alliance]**
---
&lt;plaGue&gt; is a large **german speaking** group of friends that have been playing WoW on and off since Vanilla. With every reentry to WoW we have rebuilt the guild and raidteam, growing our group to a community of skilled raiders always curious of what new stuff WoW has to offer. We have a wide range of people, from old &lt;For the Horde&gt; raiders, all the way to world rank 1000 players.
---
**Expectations:**
---
With an experienced Leadership, who has raided in Vanilla up to and including Naxx, our number one goal is to build a community that enjoys spending the evening together, while clearing the raid content in a timely fashion.
---
We are recruiting chill experienced raiders, looking to have a good time. Lacking experience in Vanilla is no problem, as long as you have any decent raiding experience.
---
Currently our raiding roster is getting close to 40 people, but still has room for any dedicated player of any class. We are aiming at an active raiding roster of 50-60 people, to ensure a smooth experience for all of our raiders.

I thought AD had a couple at the outpost between WPL and EPL? Were those added later?
---
Yeah, I don't mind if they allow cross-faction thuggery, but same-faction has to be monitored. It was very frustrating to deal with.  It'd also help if they get rid of the STV shortcut.
---
Switching to a shield on a hard boss would be worth it.
---
But yes, 95% of the time they should be doing big cleave damage for aggro.

I think you’re right to say both are good because they are. I just have a hard time imagining Druid not being better due to having essentially infinite mana in comparison to a Shaman and having rank 1 moonfire to pull mobs. In PvP Shaman also has frost shock so it’s not like Warrior will be completely boned if intercept is off cooldown.
---
As always, play the class you want to play and let the chips fall where they may.
---
Karmond and Joana I'd say, but definitely check out this guy's videos on macros, he's killing it:
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/muhshuh
---
I'd say in general you're right, but for bosses it's more like:
---
1. Mage
---
2. Combat Rogue (better threat mitigation than fury warriors w/ similar dps)
---
3. Fury Warrior
---
3. Assassination Rogue
---
4. DS Warlock
---
5. Tie btw. Hunters and SM/Ruin Warlock
---
6. Feral Druid
---
The blue pvp honor set is going to be SUPER good, comparable to Naxx gear in stats.
---
And the set is a JOKE for druid. That was my main reason for picking priest this time. Druid is my favorite class.
---
I'd go to 30 max; by then you've decided whether youre going to 60 or not
---
 I’d say the argument still stands that pserver player hate is misdirected.
---
Elitists are annoying to deal with but they are not a pserver invention by any stretch. So it’s still odd that it’s getting attached to the pserver community as if that environment invented the player archetype.
---
The price on lowbie leather on the AH on a brand new vanilla server can sometimes actually become *lower* than the price of vendoring, because so many people take skinning at first and then when they go to list on the AH they don't run over to a vendor to double check how much a stack is worth as vendor trash and instead just undercut the lowest AH stack.
---
Yeah I'd definitely have to look up a build. I know you need *some* damage to generate threat with.
---
yeah I know what you mean. the exact moment that comes to mind was me a kid during winter holiday, belly was full, outside was a raging snowstorm and I was at home drinking tea, listening to the old yogpod and leveling in Hillsbrad...good times. Can't wait to replicate them!
---
and now that I'm older I have access to weed so occasionally I'll actually be high. some of the farming is just too dull for me
---
Wow classic aint hard. Its time consuming is all
---
Community will still be there as the chats between layers are shared, with the cooldown on layer swapping this will keep integrity and I am not sure how it hinder immersion as people only leave a "layer" when joining a party, zoning in and out of an instance or changing continents. It is not like you will have players shard hopping repeatedly, hell you don't even have that in live right now.
---
DPS warrior has low desirability in dungeons as under most circumstances you will be pinching the tanks loot and he won't want you there when you could tank your own run.
---
For the Horde
---
Both! I'm starting with a warlock to be able to quickly farm up mats. Send drops to priest for disenchant and tailoring, this way my priest can work on having wands/gear made whenever I'm ready to start leveling my priest.
---
Only takes about 18 reruns of the video to hit 60.
---
Or 4, if you're a mage.
---
Or 80, if you're a warrior.
---
I played a little retail since I resubbed for the stress test and I didn't realize it had become even more of a joke.  I basically got to 15 then you just sit around and use group finder to level all the way up.  The instances are a complete face roll, healers have infinite mana.  You don't even have to move around.  It's really scary how bad they made the game.  The leveling experience is a total joke.
---
Thank you mate. I'll main a troll mage (raiding mainly). Is that a good race-class combo?
---
Would be cool, but very difficult to balance (see OP Fear Ward).
---
Also, orcs already have +5% pet damage :)
---
In your example is the person being greifed flagged for pvp or in a contested zone? If so, I don't have a problem with it and I'd recommend that the person being greifed move to a PVE server. 
---
Like take Richturpin for example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbSNQUcizml89Tp4HCfChg
---
This guy is an asshole. There is no two ways about it. However, I don't think anything in his videos has been ban or even temporary ban worthy. If you are flagged for PVP, or in a contested zone on a pvp server, you are signed up for PVP. Doesn't matter if it's 100 different players killing you 1 time each or 1 player killing you 100 times.
---
As long as you're not in a min-maxing guild you'll be fine.
---
Just go full trispec. Mind flay is really good if you wanna pvp.
---
Me and a friend are still debating horde or alliance. So hard to pick. Alliance has better story.
---
Thanks man. I am quite clever.
---
Its a good point, and I always enjoyed WotF (and I will be UD again) - but I wouldn't say horde racials are strong enough for it to be incentive to roll horde over alliance! play what race you want almost works, or atleast whatever faction
---
Created his YouTube channel right after the classic announcement and cashed in on people looking for videos about classic on YouTube.
---
Holy shit you're delusional it's not even funny.
---
Community events = WPvP?
---
As long as you notify the raid lead via previously agreed communcations it's fine. We where a fairly casual guild back in classic so we usually planed with 40players + 5 reserve. If it happens fairly often you'll be reserve by default and might have to sit out a raid if all other players are available.
---
Sometimes we moved the schedule round a bit. For example if we knew that we wouldn't get 40 man today we would do MC first and BWL at a later day or even split up for ZG. 
---
In a hardcore 40 raid that wants to use the optimal configuration expect issues if you miss ut to often.
---
Not a thing in vanilla. The only thing that can't stack is similar buffs (mongoose+greater agi elixirs, as they both give +25 agi).
---
Chilling in the water with a gator on her chest... must be florida man’s azerothian counterpart.
---
That's totally reasonable and I agree. Cheers lol
---
Yeah you get into a rhythm for hitting mobs. The once in a while where you get a bunch of bad swings you can just heal yourself up and with the ability to revive yourself when dead it wasn't usually an issue.
---
Same  - minus the irl friends
---
I’m more surprised that you care enough about upvotes to check whether it’s going down or up.
---
Facts
---
2080 Ti, 64 gigs ram, two one tb ssd’s, 🌈 lights, 4 fans, at least 800 watt power supply, Corsair gaming keyboard (k95 rgb platinum is decent), wired naga mouse.             Profit.
---
Well I got to Master 3 seasons a row whilst playing 2-3 hours max a day :-)
---
Also, WF procs are one of the most satisfying things in the game, if I do 1-3% less damage per level up through 60 I wouldn't care at all.
---
Hi, what region are you on?
---
you disagree that people stuck in a pve spec are less likely to pvp?
---
Ok so I got a bit to say and I hope you read this.
---
We have a lot of similarities and I want to share what helps me.
---
First, I played during vanilla and it was an amazing feature to my life when I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It was an escape from real life. I had no problems indulging in this game as it was a stress reliever and a coping mechanism. Online video games, in this format, where you team up with people and establish relationships is healthy as it helps to talk to real people and work together even when it’s through a game.
---
Second, I also got sick for about 8-9 months a few years ago. Turned out to be Lyme disease and it was hard to detect as this strain didn’t match all the makers in tests. So get checked for any local environmental diseases based on where you are.
---
Third, be careful with antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds. I have been on and off about a dozen different types over the past 14ish years. There are many different types and many cause issues to become worse. There are other types that work for a few weeks-months and then make things worse. It’s kind of a rarity to get the proper patient to medication match. So my point is be careful and have a family member to keep an eye on you and be honest about how it makes you feel.
---
Fourth, if classic brings back a lot of vanilla players I think we have the responsibility to police our realm and keep it... classic. Working together and not turn it into a toxic game. Which is how I feel it will be.
---
Good luck with your life and I hope to see you in game. I’m no doctor but I’m here to help give advice on depression/anxiety if you need it.
---
As someone who just returned to the game after like 10 years, I was fucking blown away by the Auction House. I have no idea what these tokens are and I'm seeing prices like $16,455 gold for like a level 15 blue... I was so confused as to how new players good get into this.
---
Suffice to say I went to a private server to get better prepared for Classic lol.
---
It's literally the definition(s), sounds like you're succumbing to the easy way out by calling people trolls when you're out of ammo. Pity
---
Healing as a shaman is a lot of fun, I started DPS shaman in Vanilla but fell in love with healing around Lvl 40 and didn't look back. 
---
DPS is boring in comparison.
---
#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
Feel free to ask questions in the comments or come and join our Discord - https://discord.gg/JDHrnU3
---
You can also check out and apply on our website at: www.thenukeandturtle.co.uk
---
literally putting 10's of thousands of players under one umbrella lol.
---
Thank you for trying to help regardless haha
---
This is the right answer. Imagine taking days off work to play only to be stuck in a log in queue and then when you finally log in you can't even do anything in the starting zones for days...best solution I can come up with is layer all starting zones for a week. After that merge the layers and disable it forever. The other option is to layer players who are below a certain level (ie. you are layered while below level 15, after 15 you are moved to the main server).
---
In vanilla, I raided on a mage and had 80% ish attendance. I worked baseball games, so I'd miss if there was a home game on raid night.  It kept me from being a "core" raider, but my class leader liked me well enough and still prioritized getting me in above the other tier 2s. It also helped that I brought winter's chill =)  
---
For Classic, I'll be running a  fairly casual guild and going EPGP for loot distribution. Raid invites will be attendance based, but after a set "start" time, first come first serve. If a player is online on raid night and wait listed, I'll still be counting them as there for attendance and giving partial EP so long as they are available to fill in. If you want to know more, let me know.  
---
Mileage will vary from guild to guild. Just make sure that your expectations and the leaderships expectations match and everyone will have a good time.
---
I totally get where you are coming from - I really do... BUT, I think you forgot that back in the beginning, things were **supposed** to go wrong. Pulls were supposed to fail in instances. Extra adds from PvE mobs were supposed to make you go "oh s\_\_t, I'm gonna die". The ghost walk of shame was supposed to be irritating and punishing you for making poor decisions or being the victim of circumstance.   
---
Much of why many of us (like myself) that have been wanting a return to classic, is because we miss the challenge, and that means the challenge of the game and of the other people playing it.
---
The best solution is still to be prepared to immediatly move far away so nobody can grief for a while. 
---
Sure there's the /who command, but it'll only give you the region, you can put footage of another place in the zone to attract people there as a decoy.
---
You can also randomize the first stage of brackets according to what place is free of trouble and have duels happen when people hearth back if there's anyone involved.
---
Still works. Uncontested or not, as I said, you can still have people sitting on your face... 
---
Another way would be to find a place accessible only with the speed of a mount, like having to cross a pit and then summoning people there, any place that is limited enough. Limits the income of people at least.
---
Thank you for putting everything in to words. That feels exactly how I and a lot of other people are.
---
I think the biggest issue in low level groups is tanks taking charge when needed. When those guys are still green, you have groups with a lot less direction. Then later on you have a tank with macros who marks dps and cc targets, and you just fly through it. Even groups with below average players are fine if they can follow simple directions.
---
The frontstab mechanic, from what I understand, is a private server lag related issue that wasnt a thing in vanilla and wont be a mechanic in classic.
---
I’ve got a question for the community since you guys are so awesome I figured I’d ask here. I’m planning on being a Paladin in classic and want to play holy in raids and dungeons and play Ret when it becomes better in tbc. What’s the best leveling spec I should go with if I’m doing it solo? I’ve heard stuff about tank or ret but I’m not sure. Thanks!
---
I watched venruki's and cdew's pov and remember a moment where they were supposedly waiting for cooldowns even tho both player were ready... Veruki or cdew looked at their asmon's stream only to be welcomed by an advertisement 5 seconds in... There was a lt of excessive downtime for no good reason... Btw your reply makes no sense I think you forgot some words
---
 Troll Rogue : Vodo Poisons (+5% poison dmg.) 
---
That's OP as fuck...
---
I've decided not to use Discord for raid sign-ups, but originally had planned to add class emotes and then people can react to a raid with their class emote if they're attending.
---
Can do the same with role emotes instead if you prefer (tank,heal,dps)
---
You could always be a teacher, they have at minimum 3 months off.
---
Oh yeah im not saying thaete won't be queues even with sharding. But the stress test queues were infinitely better than like bfa launch. I was able to get in to the stress test in maybe 30-45 minutes and only disconnected once. Bfa launch the average queue me and my buddies experienced was 2+ hours for max 30 min of actual playtime before getting disconnected.
---
Assassination Rogues are still great single target DPS. I was always top 5 even without Perdition's Blade. This is before BWL mind, so maybe I'm wrong.
---
OP said he doesnt RP but youre twisting his words by quoting " i am my character" over and over, it seems to me like youre the one out of ammo considering you keep using the same lame argument.
---
Interesting idea. That holy priest would miss a lot of healing talents though.
---
Also, I think tryharding shadow does more damage than tryharding boomkin.
---
Man this is amazing, great work! 
---
Question: will the user be able to change font/color, or will this maybe be an easy change from the LUA files?
---
Just to ask em back for classic 6 months later
---
They were buff bots for locks if I recall correctly. They gave that +shadow debuff on the target if memory serves
---
That’s the hardest part for me. I plan to just tank all the instances until it’s raid time.
---
Jesus, $50k... and I read the fine print on that auction site: they charge you an additional 25% "buyer's fee" on top of your winning bid.
---
I really wanted to play druid, they’re fun to level, but their damage is just so goddamn disappointing. As a fresh 60 druid you still have trouble taking more than two mobs at once in Scarlet Monastery. While levelling, you need to heal up after every two mobs or so.
---
I started playing mage and was just amazed at how hard they nuke shit. And, while very situational, being able to take down 10 or more mobs at once just makes you feel so powerful.
---
Sorry dr00d, I’m going mage.
---
I just looked it up and you're right. The levelling will take longer then, because bear mode is more effective than your actual feral rotation if you aren't frontstabbing. It won't affect pve if you have a tank though, and it probably won't affect pvp. Also, with the now huge melee leeway, tauren druid combined with the amazing speed of feral cat is scary in pvp
---
Not too much though, or we’ll get Sunwell added to Classic, which has dailies.
---
I can't imagine why any priest who goes that far into healing wouldn't take Holy Nova. It's an instant AoE dmg spell for 1 talent point!
---
Dude,  I'm happy for you.  First of all,  as someone who also struggles with depression, getting out of your head and feeling ok to Express these kinds of feelings is a huge step in the right direction. I hope you get better,  and when classic finally opens up I'd love to join your guild.
---
That's ok, every week 2 druids drop off until there's 1 or 2 left. By then their last piece drops to be full epic together with a rogue's first epic.
---
A game I played around the same time (Star Wars Galaxies) was almost exclusively a mob grind extravaganza. I tried to apply the same logic to WoW and, holy shit, it was slow and monotonous. I would not wish that on my worst enemy.
---
Oo.. It's been a few years now. I *think* it's just added into the story as a sort of side quest? Should be on the wartable.
---
Might've been different in 1.4, yea. But I didn't hear about anyone going assa in 1.12. I heard of some going sub, mainly for Hemorrhage (support spec so to say).
---
My gf wants to be alliance, i want to be horde.
---
Hm must have been a tbc change then.
---
Good to know!
---
Why would I need ammo when using a definition? Factual data vs opinion
---
You're obviously wrong but I still nice to hear kind words &lt;3
---
in a classic plus sense adding some version of the sunwell could be neat lol
---
Well damn, guess I know where to direct people with questions. Thanks!
---
I linked to the site. I doubt that his armor is the most expensive prop. There are over 50 pages of auctions.
---
Someone paid 1600 for a small replica model orc tent.
---
Its only party as well? Not raid.
---
Head over to /r/woweconomy, enough content to make you a wall street expert instead.
---
Stack up your products for a while, watch the prices, then place at where it ends up. Repost from time to time.
---
Price is always much higher than vendor price cause there's also the posting fee to account for. Some speedleveling methods say to vendor the leather for some quick raw gold for example, but in regular leveling you'd rather sell them in stacks when the price is high.
---
People will be broke at first so you gotta wait it out a bit
---
But then are people ok with the tank rolling against a rogue for melee DPS gear?  Seems like people are always saying you should only roll on your current dungeon role.
---
Mages, rogues, warriors are your official top tier. 
---
Rest do get included but compete heavily for the place in the group, need to very skilled bringing their utility and supporting the top tier and key roles
---
Sad? No no it's always funny to not be sure if real or joke:)
---
yeah..
---
ZeroedTV

I work in pharmaceutical production.
---
Hey dude. I have dealt with anxiety and depression (and mania) for all of my adult life. I think the biggest thing that helps me whenever I'm having an episode is the thought that everything is temporary in regards to state of mind. This means that even though it doesn't seem like it right now, there WILL be a time when you dont feel this shitty. It seems like wow elicits some very powerful and real emotions for you which is something you shouldn't question when you are depressed as depression often dulls excitement and enjoyment of things you love. In my personal experience, the medications did not flip a switch for me, they did not make me feel happy or euphoric, but that's not really what they do. I took the meds along with listening to what my mind needed (a break from school, some exercise and an improved diet) and eventually I righted the ship. I know how you feel right now seems insurmountable and it's not easy to take anyone's advice; but if wow is a source of solace and joy.... dont question it, play the fk out it ! 
---
Let us know how the doctor went, it could be psychosomatic!
---
Oh boy you are dumb.
---
Thank you!
---
I'll probably change it at some point. My taste is terrible but with enough try I'll find something less poisonish and still contrasting. Probably default yellow font could work.
---
May add an option for this too when the rest is done.
---
At the month of launch, aug 27-sep 27, I’ll probably average 4-6 hours a day. I might play 10 hours on launch day, but not play at all on the weekends. Or maybe jus a steady 3 hours a day. 
---
But after that, I can’t keep up with that. Between work, music, and my personal life, I can’t be spending that long on one hobby. At launch, though? We’ve been waiting for this for so goddamn long, I’m no lifing it for a few days, even if I don’t have vacation time to spend.
---
If I understand correctly when you party with a member of another layer you have 50-50 chance to go into his layer of him to yours. That means you really can be stuck in your shitty dimension ? Or when someone want to help you he can go to your layer and be fucked.
---
And if layering are about balanced pop so the layer with nobody will attract more player... So when there is an event just pray man.
---
Honestly if player want to accumulate into same streamer dimension and it's a battle of every day just remove layer.
---
Why... Just why...
---
Exactly.
---
Makes sense cause immersion
---
No being called "champion" or "hero" by every NPC within hearing distance! No enemies that stun you and run away, or capture you, during cutscenes!
---
Yeah bruh that's more terrifying. You see a warrior in aq gear you go the other way.
---
When using /who to locate someone, it wouldn't take long to find them using a /tar macro, so the dueler coundn't be park there for too long prior to dueling, perhaps logging out a day before is best solution.
---
Either way, I think we establish that there are a lot of nuances to consider base on what we did mention, and likely a lot more that we didn't. Tips and the organizers did have plans for trying to deal with it on the fly and eventually found a solution. You'd think it would've been fine dueling in TB, and on paper it should have been fine. But in practice, they Ally were able to easiely show up and hang out in the back undetected by guards and well within range to interfere. Even all of your "off the top of my head ideas" might not pan out in practice.
---
*Darth Vader: NoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO*
---
Just play a class like mage that isn’t as gear dependent. We can win fights purely based on engi items and pvp trinkets like tidal charm.
---
The game has obviously changed a lot over the years and if it’s too much of a grind for you just play retail.
---
Warlock used to have to collect souls shards to use some abilities. Collected by killing the opponent with a weak ass soul drain.
---
In vanilla it’s a dkp payout to being on time which imo is the way to do it until bwl. Then you go looot council for bwl
---
I recommend reading up on the rotations for pve and pvp before making your decision if you haven’t already. 
---
I was really wanting to roll a hunter but they have a two button pve rotation. After healing in vanilla that doesn’t sound that engaging.
---
Please do!
---
Weapon does matter, Manual Crowd Pummeler or bust if you're trying to dps. You need to use MCP charges every single boss to be able to do competitive dps as cat. All of this damage is single target only so your dps is low for multi target fights and trash. 
---
You also have to chug mana potions and dark runes constantly to maintain your mana which gets expensive. You need to do all of this and you still can't beat warrior dps. 
---
Agility &gt; Strength for cats because of the crit rating it gives.
---
Is cat dps viable for raids? Certainly. 
---
Gotta ask yourself if it is worth the effort though.
---
That’s it.
---
For naxx fury warriors will be the most desirable class.
---
Well now I'm debating a full Stargate rewatch as well, thanks!
---
I was a rogue back then and we cared about dps meters a lot if we liked raiding. I don't think I knew a single rogue, mage or warlock that liked to raid but did not run a dps meter.
---
Formed a vanilla guild on a private server that will then migrate to classic, we are a horde guild.
---
A large emphasis on being nice, chatty and welcoming to people, more so than hardcore raiding
---
Discord at: gg/ZtT5Zar
---
So you'll play for exactly how long layering will be in, and quit as soon as it's removed?  Informed decision.
---
Who won?
---
Innervates are saved for priests tyvm
---
Layering: I think it will be a necessary evil to begin with, everyone being lvl 1 and fighing over extremely limited mobs/resources, it just wont be fun to play. As people start to level up and there is a nice spread on the difference in levels on a server population, it should then be shut off. couple of months tops I'd say.
---
Merging Servers however? lets hear you say "FUCK NO, JAMES!".
---
The joke is from a german radio play called Allimania. It takes a about 9 hours to complete, but man is it good. If you speak german, and like wow it's a must watch.
---
This is really heartwarming, thanks for sharing it.
---
I'm really hoping Classic helps you :).
---
To be honest, this 1year+ of wait feels like the Purgatory, and the Heaven at the end is Classic.
---
I made my argument about identity and how cheap respecs invalidate it 
---
It also increases the importance of gold and provides a much needed gold sink 
---
also anything that pushes the game in the retail direction is a bad thing
---
lastly its not going to change so no point in bitching about it
---
I just don't know why you keep bring up streamers when I never mention them in my examples? 
---
The person that's getting ganked/camped/harassed? is irrelevant, the focus is on the dedication/purpose/actions of the ganker and if there is any line to draw for harassment via pvp killing and camping.
---
I guess but you can probably stay up later in weekends no?
---
it will be the same in this regard, but that is NOT a bad thing!  This is why vanilla is so GREAT!   It's bloody Deadmines!  of course people will do all that shit.  And now it comes:  You put the ONE guy that DID play fine on your friends list and the 3 morons on your ignore list.   Next week you  invite that friend, and another, and you already have a base of 3 decent players, and wailing caverns will go a bit better,  By the time you arrive at Scarlet Monastery, you have a network and as soon as you log in, you already get the whisper:  'Hey , wanna come SM:Armory?' and you see that it will go smooth as a baby's buttocks
---
Thanks for the illustration! Agreed on all counts, but in cases like this, the cost of implementing spec-specific rules seems higher than the cost of some "unfairness" in the relative value of each list or losing a piece of good gear to an off-spec bid. That said, I'm happy to hear ideas to remedy issues like this.
---
&gt; doesn't matter how good you are 
---
classic in a nutshell, where imbalance isnt that frustrating because there are no competitive systems in place :)
---
Just regular turn ins.
---
Although some would take a full day of farming to pass in for some people. Bit of a stretch tho.
---
Most I've been in have not been horribly strict even in the more hardcore minded ones, pretty standard experience as most with as long as you make 3 out of 4 or so you are pretty good as a core member.
---
Just like in school and work though, it's the unexcused absences and tardiness that will get you in trouble, or when someone is distracted while you are playing when you said you would.
---
Usually people are more concerned about having people that will be there and be attentive and prepared when they said they would be over someone that makes every raid even when he really shouldn't be there.
---
Is it really bis? The strength on Quick strike ring is also beneficial for druids and they only need 9% hit to be capped which will become easier and easier to reach.
---
Dual wield classes will benefit from it up untill naxx, to give it to a feral over them seems ludicrous to me.
---
I think that bug was only in battle grounds.
---
The first three things in my list were features (not bugs), the only bug I included was the pets. There are many more bugs that hopefully will be fixed.

---
Early version models then maybe.
---
Actually it’s only one guy who apparently can’t contact his friends ahead of time to determine which server to make characters on. Lol
---
In 04’ servers couldn’t handle 20k people on them at one time.
---
&gt;causes 5 others
---
List them.
---
they were insanely weak and that's why people under estimate them so much
---
In 1.12  they will be much better than how they were seen during vanilla
---
Wait a second, this isn't Toto - Africa
---
How am I supposed to level in the barrens with this alliance boar slaying nonsense?
---
What you are asking for is sharding, zone by zone splitting. Layering is Continent by Continent. As for how long it is one that depends on the population of the servers and how long it is stable for.
---
I decided to play some classic wow but told myself I'd workout while doing it. 
---
Fishing. Fishing is fucking slow and boring to me. So I cast my line, mouseover the bobber, and pick up the mouse. Then I can do squats or lift weights with the other hand. When i hear the splash sound I click, catch fish, repeat. 
---
Flight paths, I go do some pushups or some lunges. 
---
I'm sore. But it feels good. Just to compliment the down time in wow with something self constructive. Make it something where I feel better for playing the game.
---
Yeah stealth will help a lot, is bear good early on, my buddy never liked it he always healed or was oomkin.
---
It's not really a bad thing. Means you don't have to rez everyone up in raids 😂
---
Plus, you can always just tank, and when you heal you can have a shaman/pally/priest in the group as a dps to res
---
Down here is OUR time.
---
You are asking for sharding, the thing that everyone said they did not want. They came up with another solution that kept people in within one layer within one continent.
---
I don't see that the developer announced any support for classic. The current version of this addon doesn't work for classic.
---
"ENOUGH!"
---
Can't is the essence of your being.
---
Oh ya they will be miles better. Leveling a druid in August will be a world of difference from leveling one originally.
---
I'd warn you that it is quite a bit slower.
---
Dungeons are worth it if you have questions or want to pick up some key loot
---
I get it, too. I met a ton of cool people on private servers, but so many people flexing knowledge like douches, often while being completely and utterly wrong. Here are reasons people have told me I "obviously didn't play Vanilla wow"
---
- I didn't enjoy multiday Alterac Valley, and neither did anyone I played with
---
- I never heard anyone say they thought corpse camping was griefing in the TOS or saw someone's reputation on their own faction ruined for doing it.
---
- I said I was getting a cat pet for world pvp and not Lupos, at least until zg comes out
---
- I said an average hunter will beat an average rogue
---
- I said frost mage was a difficult matchup for a hunter
---
- I said I remember freezing trap sharing a cooldown with scatter (this has been proven whether people call it a bug or not)
---
Then there are all the 10 year olds spamming racist sgit on p servers that you learn to tune out.
---
\-Do you want to play to have fun? 
---
\-Do you want to constantly be oom?
---
Mage actually had to at least think a little bit and time mana gem / pot / evocate, in addition to having a plethora of AoE spells and other things
---
Warlock just spams shadowbolt and lifetaps every few shadowbolts.
---
wut, they are like the "meta" healer or whatever
---
Shamans will be in the melee groups for windfury.
---
Layers are not temporary, they are persistent. A character created will always be in the same layer. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
&gt; I just don't know why you keep bringing up streamers when I never mention them in my examples?
---
Your first comment in this thread was "Can we compare long term stream snipers with players who would harass another player for weeks/months?"
---
So You are talking about a hypothetical situation of some random players deciding to a greif one (non-streamer) player for literally days/weeks/months on end? You really think this is so likely to occur that Blizzard needs to have a stance on it now?
---
But I can downvote you! :)
---
Would be neat to have a gnome quest where you have to help a warrior gnome that was outcast from the major nerd towns.
---
Enhance isnt that bad. Its at least as good as feral. Other than that nice list.
---
Yes.
---
it's perfectly ok to leave a group in certain circumstances.  What is important is that you establish a network of people you want to play with and a list of people you want to avoid.   If you happen to get stuck in a group of strangers that  will end up the second list, the RIGHT thing to do is to leave them , add them to that list  and move on.    Obviously you do this when it's certain they will end up the list, not after 10 minutes when they make one mistake.......
---
It all depends on the tank. If the tank is a TANK, not some DPS that is forced to tank because reasons.
---
But yes, you are right. Looking at how few people are going to play tanks, it is bound that most PuGs will have "forced" tanks, hence, they will wipe, time and time again.
---
Without leadership, everyone will do w/e the fuck they think they should do, and blame everyone but themselves.
---
It will be MARVELOUS !
---
I am saying that, because I will be a tank, a real one, that likes his job, just like in Vanilla, and people will LOVE me :)
---
You're a mad man.
---
How much slower?
---
That's because some people aren't good enough to realize that utility makes raids run smoothly, probably because they only know how to spam frostbolt and don't know that healing meters aren't important in most fights - in the fights where healing matters druids do fine because the other healers don't have the time/mana to snipe everything
---
I prefer it that way 
---
I like a game that rewards time, effort, and knowledge/dedication
---
if I want crazy skills hard stuff ill play a shooter... actually no I wont I dont really like them lol
---
Ill play dark souls lol (which I also maintain is largely Knowledge over skill)
---
I am nostalgic for the time when you could kick someone from a dungeon group more than once per month.
---
Mistakenly thought bg’s were in phase 2. That pvp rewards. Bg’s come in phase 3 as you probably know.
---
When I saw the title of your post, I felt such a strong sense of belonging and like I wasn't alone in feeling the same way. 
---
I played classic when I was 12 years old. Life was great then. I had friends, I had my family, I had a nice home, life felt right. Just before WOTLK came out, we had to move away from all of that. All the good things seemed to fall apart. My parents separated. I had no home/family life. I lost all my friends. 
---
Today, things seem to have only gotten worse.
---
Thinking about playing classic again, it puts me back in that time. Back when life was right. I was a filthy casual so all I did was level different characters, but I'm so excited to be back in the Barrens, spank noobs with my twinks in BGs, and feel like everything is right again. 
---
I can't wait to make new friends and family in the Azeroth I called home. 
---
TLDR: Same.
---
Exactly. Why even play Enhance if you’re not going to see massive multiple attacks and delete a full HP mob every now and then?
---
Tranquil Air, the threat reduction totem, shares the air totem slot with Windfury. This creates competition for Shaman between Windfury for Melee groups and Tranquil Air for groups with Warlocks. While it can be a potential option, more often that not Windfury wins out in practice.
---
It also gave me the strength to leave an extremely domestic abuse relationship and carry on with my life a free person pursuing healing my brain from the traumas. 
---
I became so invested into the concepts of video game philosophical / emotional wellness thought alongside of the totality of all of my interests in shamanism and human growth that I decided to create an educational learning plan designed to help people save themselves, grow themselves, and experience the zen of adventure gameplay to the fullest potential. 
---
There literally has not been a game released since the original Warcraft era that matched it as an adventure game experience. A few incredible adventure games have been made since, yes, but none with the full power of a huge world filled with your friends and family, inviting you to get to know it, yourself, and your team mates slowly and mindfully.
---
It's time (a lot of time) + skill. If you lack one or another you can forget about rank 14.
---
Hi, I found your post through search, because I'm having the same problem. I'm posting my experiences for anyone in the future.
---
Firefox, uBlock Origin (not adblock plus), RES, and using old.reddit.com. 
---
After reading this, I disabled the subreddit style, and that fixed the performance issues for me. I would say there's definitely something in the CSS.
---
I’ve been reading every single WoW novel leading up to Classic plus a full Warcraft 3 playthrough and your addon will be a huge payoff. So to me, this is going to be the best addon.
---
I mainly played with people on the UK mix irc/ventrilo server (and later enemydown league). I was also actively playing cod 1 so when WoW hit we made one big guild combining people from both communities. We were on Bladefist (which became Outland) and that server community was really awesome. Sadly the guild died at the end of vanilla as many of us were busy with uni or working more.
---
I still watch the big csgo tournaments on my TV but haven't really played in years. I can't keep up nowadays haha. Looking forward to classic :)
---
IDK, i think putting a shaman in a group with 3 warlocks is a worthwhile investment.
---
BREAK IT DOWN BITCH, LEMME SEE YOU BACK IT UP
---
People are free to roll off-spec, but as you say, they are usually paying a price for future main-spec upgrades (depending on their rank). Most off-spec suicides happen towards the bottom of the rankings. I'm not sure I understand what you mean about trading DE mats, but if you're saying that someone could retain their rank AND receive a piece of gear simply by trading in the DE mats, I'd say that's too exploitable (show up to raid with bags full of shards).
---
Self innervate!
---
If you communicate your schedule ahead of time and let them know you'll be out for X/Y/Z dates, that's fine. They can usually fill a spot. 
---
If you are Late to the raid on days you were supposed to be there, that is a far more serious issue that most raids won't tolerate.
---
Very cool idea! If you can incorporate dungeons into it it'd be a game-changer!
---
[this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7c94uh/how_slow_is_leveling_through_dungeons_in_vanilla/dpo2xx3) got to level 44 in 11 game days vs 60 in 10 days on another toon
---
This isn't really any proof but may be an indicator

For anyone wondering the crowd pummeler is a 2 handed mace with +16 Str and +5 Agil. What makes this weapon great is that it will increase your attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds. Unfortunately it only has 3 charges before it becomes useless. Fortunately you can solo farm it in Gnomeregan. 
---
Topically you want to use it in fights where bosses don't move (tank and spank). You park urself behind the boss activate the pummeler and go through your powershift rotation.
---
*laughs in self innervating to powershift*
---
Yes you could argue Enhance for C because of the rng to randomly one shot someone. Most of the time its D though.
---
I guess it depends on the number of shamans you have.
---
It remains to be seen exactly how it will work (we just dont have enoigh druids in the beta) but there's reason to believe that the Legion macros will make this rotation even easier/less aesthetically wonky. 
---
Given that shifting out of forms doesn't spark a GCD (nor does potion use), you could use a macro to de-shift cat form, use a pot/rune or do nothing, and then immediately shift back into cat form with just one button. This should happen so fast you might not even catch your model changes out of cat form. 
---
All in all the rotation is still trickier than most, but I also think it's one of the most engaging you can play in the game
---
Similar thing happened to me. I tried leveling a paladin prior to classic release, but only got to 35 before I started getting bored. So I switched to Druid and I’m having a blast so far. Even as resto questing is just as fast as anyone but can also fill in any role needed for dungeons. My only question now is whether I want to go horde or alliance. If they ever decide to do TBC servers I’ll probably go back to pally even though resto is supposed to be insane.
---
They're much better one Horde side due to WF in the BWL/early AQ era, but by the time Naxx comes around the combination of Blessing of Kings and Salvation is far better for dual wielding; Largely due to how BoK scales better with stats compared to WF scaling more with weapon damage, and BoS has an effect that scales directly with how much damage you do.
---
Shedo, I haven't watched the guide yet (at work), but how competitive is feral DPS without the Manual Crowd Pummeler? Consume farming alone for DPS is a bit of a grind, and if you add in a couple hours a week just for a weapon, I'm a bit intimidated to roll druid again...advice? Thanks.
---
This is especially true in Classic, as the PVE content is incredibly easy compared to today's raids. Many lesser skilled guilds will just progress by overgearing and smashing their head against the wall. There is only a small group of bosses where these types of raids will be stopped for extended times (e.g. Vael because of threat management, Skeram, C'Thun, and some Naxx bosses). Otherwise, you can easily kill everything with enough time at your hands.   
---
Tl;dr: Progression in Classic is very quick if you are skilled. Worse raids can simply spend more time. Both raids will eventually probably clear most if not all of the content. Only the efficiency is different.
---
Layering shouldn't change that though.
---
What feral gear is that? Tier 2.5 is wanted by very many  classes. The weapon is a turn in that can also give great weapons for other classes.
---
The farming heroic thing is from WotLK and Cata so bit of an outdated complaint. There are still a lot of token systems for catch up gear though because Blizzard is all about playing the current patch sort of like diablo 3 seasons so they basically gift you intro raid gear in the first two weeks of a patch.
---
They are usualy a little bit more popular than paladins and shamans but that's because they are restricted to one faction...
---
Isn't that a Barlow joke?
---
Yes and Yes!

Undead Strath needs so much coordination.  Every pull is a potential wipe.
---
Its rarely used because you can't target it so if the tank is nearby and in the same party it's useless. In a raid you still have hope everyone is nearby the totem (totems are more difficult in general to keep up than pally blessings). Also, the totem lasts only 2 mins, doesn't clear threat just reduces it by 20%, and shares a totem type (air) with windfury totem and  wrath of air totem - meaning neither of those totems can be used if you want to use the threat the totem
---
This is not a solution as it does not solve the problem of over population as people will join one of these sub realms over another because of a draw. This draw may be a major guild, streamer, or anything else. This one subrealm will be come over populated, have queues, etc or they will population cap it and then you can not play with your friends until it comes to a point where they merge realms. This is not a good solution as it does nothing for population control, queues or server stability but still has the same greater issues of community disruption, AH disparities, and everything else. Layers solves all these issues with out creating many others.
---
Surely you meant to post https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
This was probably the most absurd thing I've ever seen in WoW, still makes me laugh to this day.
---
I’m honestly not trying to fit my own narrative. I legitimately hadn’t been shown a link that said anything other than a few weeks from the one I shared. This is my first time seeing this other video so I thank you for that.
---
Though I would challenge your first point that “a few” should be less than at least 5 weeks. If he truly meant “a few” though obviously it’s PR and people can overpromise and underdeliver as many devs have in the past.
---
Sorry, didn't main a warrior and haven't done my doctorate in research to know anything.  You could just answer my question, but I see you're rather act like an elitist.
---
Either way, fear ward isn't a requirement to complete raids.  We cleared through Naxx with one Dwarf priest in our guild.  Sure, all the sweaty try hards like you will have dwarf priests and human warrior/rogues.
---
I hope nobody gives you shit for that. I think the people who give it a bad rap are those who will just enter a discussion negative, then call anyone who disagrees a wrath baby.
---
I think if you find the right crowd, private servers are awesome. Plenty of former hardcore raiders and pvpers who don't take the game as seriously anymore, yet are still really good. Makes for some great times.
---
I've gone back and forth on having benched raiders rise in ranks along with the attendees, but it just complicates the process too much. What do you mean by "got equal loot incentives"? Are your benched players included in the attendee list? If so, how do you implement that?
---
Nice idea to bring verticality to a basically 100% horizontal world.
---
Pretty sure there was an addon that showed real honor/kill in classic
---
In reality layering will be active as long as the population of a realm remains high and it is needed to maintain stability and no queues. Once the population falls off it will be removed/threshholds turned up so that it only becomes active if the server becomes unstable.
---
Gross
---
Its DPSing Merry! The druid is DPSing!
---
Dont give him loot! Dont encourage it!
---
There are a few errors here.
---
&gt; which in Classic as far as current knowledge holds requires 310 weapon skill
---
It is 308 weapon skill in increments of -4% penalty (going from 307 to 308 is just -2% penalty).
---
&gt; equals around 12% straight up dps increase.
---
This is wrong. Moving the penalty from 35% to 5% means your DPS increases by 0.12 **times your weapon damage**. Not by 12%. By 12% *of your weapon damage*. That's a difference.
---
The actual difference is 12% divided by 40% x 0.65 + 60% = 0.86 so pretty much 14%.
---
&gt; The formulae for GB reduction is linear so going for 305 weapon skill is pretty much 5-6% dps increase.
---
It's a 9.3% dps increase for white swings on average as you lowered your glancing blow penalty from 35% to 15%.
---
&gt;  But it will not make or break encounters or anything.
---
I disagree with that. In a PvE raiding context it does make or break encounters IMO.
---
&gt; But if not caring for absolute min-max roll what you enjoy.
---
That's simplifying things IMO. It's a bit like deciding to play without wearing any gloves. I would not exactly call that min/max but I do concede you are technically correct. Picking the higher DPS choice is technically min/max.
---
**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends

It did not bother you but it would be a death sentence to much of the population as the first couple hours of a game is make or break for most people. If they do not hook you in that time people leave. It is as simple as that.
---
Yes but they are wrong. See [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/caa3dw/dps_loss_for_not_rolling_human_warrrogue/et9orbi/) for a correction of those numbers.
---
Yes, I'm planning a 5-man mbox melee cleave team: Druid Tank, 3xWar, and Priest Heals. EU RP server though. So far I've tested 1-16 using fedex/kill-only quest, then 16-22 grinding deadmines (first 2 bosses + trash). Takes 5 clears per level at 16. After that I'm going Stockades -&gt; SM -&gt; ?? -&gt; BRD @ lvl50 for pre-BIS gear. Still working on what to do after SM.
---
I don't think they got spellpower totem until TBC.  Maybe you are thinking of Grace of Air which gives AGI.
---
&gt;There are some questions; how long will phase 1 last? 
---
Afaik it should be around 2 months, but that's pure speculation as Blizzard won't release the phase release dates beforehand.
---
&gt; Some people will nolife to 60 in the first week and start farming  lotuses and thorium and devilsaurs uncontested while everyone else is  still levelling. That's fine, but if we can switch layers at will by  joining a group or guild, they get several servers' worth of those high  end resources to farm.  
---
They put restrictions to server to prevent such abuse iirc, and if they really wanted to prevent that they could as well make sure you only have 1 lotus at any given time across all layers. They can do it with sharding so i doubt they can't with layering.
---
Dunno how effective these changes will be but at least they seem to be aware of this issue and tried (or are still trying) to fix it.
---
Do they not also maintain Corruption and Immolate as well? It's not a big rotation addition per se, but still should be done. Vanilla was a simpler time, certainly. Maybe it was dull, and will be more so after over a decade of more complex rotations and raid mechanics.
---
Hey m, kinda late comment but I hope you see it. Like every person I've had some low points. I used to say I was depressed but not realy as bad some people have it so I've stopped calling it that. In those moments it really helped to cling on to something postitive and most of the times I would escape into game world WoW being my top choise. I always logged on to pservers and levelled mostly through wotlk and did some low level content with a random guild i found. 
---
Just wanted ti say keep going and see you in Azeroth brother! Lok'tar
---
Ah, okay - so the reasoning behind the decision is clarified. But, what about your ideas. I was more interested in the theory crafting from players on lore based mechanics ideas that could have been. Kind of a nerd request - I know.
---
I can't speak for everyone but, when I played on Nost. People didn't dip on a dungeon or rage because you wiped. People would just group back up and, give it another go. You gotta let people take time and acclimate to the new slower pace. Retail kids are gonna struggle at first but, they catch up with the program soon enough.
---
Unfortunately you’re probably right   That sounds terrible. Back to private servers sooner than I thought, I guess.
---
That is not what negligible means. The word you are looking for is perhaps insignificant.
---
Was "spit-balling" ideas  that popped into my head. What would have been cool and balanced?
---
Unfortunately you’re probably right. Oh well. I guess it’s back to private servers earlier than I thought.
---
Yeah I'm "play whatever you want" too, but I like discussing such possibilities :)
---
Mind Blast have a large cooldown though, 5.5 seconds if talented. That holy priest would still want to Mind Flay to get it going. Then, Weaving lasts 15 seconds during which he can heal, less in practice because lack of hit.
---
So I think it wouldn't work well even though is interesting.
---
Sorta. One of the pserver mages has Classic access and says you can't do what they do on pservers for leveling any more. He advised doing quests/dungeons/AOE leveling (in that order). Really interesting interview from the guy on youtube.
---
I googled that site hoping that it exists 😭

**&lt;Sharp And Shiny&gt; | NA | RP - PvE | Progression Raiding Guild**
---
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
---
**Who are we:** &lt;Sharp and Shiny&gt; is a PvE progression focused guild made up of a mix of folks with original vanilla and private server experience as well as other MMOs. We are currently looking for more to round out our pre launch roster.
---
**What to expect from us:** Those who choose to be a part of our guild can expect to be a part of a focused but relaxed raiding environment that will clear fresh content quick and effectively. In classic, we want to put a larger focus on having more casual members or socials to in the future allow for more out of main raid activities, such as PvP, dungeons, and raid PuGs, which we hope will reduce the onset of raid log mentality.
---
**What we expect from you:** We have a 80% minimum raid attendance requirement. We intend to be in Molten Core 4 weeks after launch at the latest and have a hard leveling time cap of 6 weeks to hold a raid spot. After hitting cap, we expect each raider to be working towards their pre raid BiS as well as farming for their raid consumables. We expect every member to act mature, especially to those outside of the guild, as we will be very conscious of our guilds reputation on the server that we choose to play. Mainly just don't be a dick.
---
**Why RP-PvE?:** The community. While the guild itself is not RP restricted and we have no RP expectations for any of our members, we are rolling on a RP server to avoid the elitism and toxicity that is sometimes prevalent on PvE and PvP servers. We also plan on possibly holding server community events that we believe will be more accepted on an RP server.
---
**Raid times:** Sun/Tues 6:00 - 9:00 PST with a potential third day added come phase 5
---
**Loot system:** Loot Council
---
**What are we currently looking for?:**
---
Mages
---
Dwarf Priest
---
If you don't fit these rolls feel free to apply, as we will always be welcoming of exceptional applicants of any class.
---
 **If you have any questions or want to apply, come join our discord.**

The difference between 300 and 305 skill (no matter where you get it) is **at the very least** 3%. But in reality it is much larger.
---
&gt;Having 50-100 less dps from your boomkin rather than a mage
---
I'm all for hybrid dps'ers. I've mained an elemental shaman on private servers for years and i've done a few raids as a balance druid too. To say that they only do 50-100 less dps than a mage is just pure bullshit. A mage could push his keys with his toes and still manage to out-damage all of the hybrid damage dealers, and that's just a fact.
---
Well I was attempting to "draw a line" of harassment thru discussion with you, or rather, to see where/if you would draw said line. But you view seems bias and is worded in such a vague way the implies if your streamer, you can't be harassed, and refused to acknowledge if there is a line to draw if you don't stream but are targeted by a ganker for whatever reason. 
---
Those reason can be plentiful and the extremism is so rampant already via players reaction to a streamer's blacklist that many have pledged to play solely to gank/camp streamers. It's gotten to a point where some don't want to play the game without a streamer's influence(bad/good) but rather instead to play with the single purpose to gank a streamer.
---
I just wanted to establish an understanding(a line) for what defines harassment and could have consequences regardless of whether or not the target is a streamer. I feel like there should be a line somewhere, and that even streamers can be a victim if others cross that line. I don't feel like stream sniping alone is crossing that line, but targeting a player over and over thru unnatural interactions may be.
---
Hah. Nice. :D
---
Dungeons, sure, but a lack of tanking leathers combined with no shields meant they took a LOT of damage in raids. They couldn’t push crits off the table without shield block and lack of Defense stat on the available feral leathers meant they couldn’t get rid of Crushing blows, either.
---
I'm not shedo or some feral god but I can answer this one. Helm gives you 20 energy on shift meaning with furor (40) and timing before ticks (another 20) you have 80 energy. This is enough for two shreds, then you powershifts again.
---
If you didn't have the helm you'd add two useless seconds to wait for another energy tick to shred twice
---
non hardcore guilds in vanilla still wanted to down bosses and got picky.  if you were a holy priest, you got in no matter what.  if you were a mage, you got in.
---
Hi, /u/kentdk
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/can19p/what_class_should_you_play/). 
---
Yes there definitely was several AddOns.
---
I just think it’s cool to replicate the bevavior from retail Vanilla when you could not see the actual stuff without an AddOn, and had no way of seeing one’s actual honor for a given week in their character sheet (assuming the sheet worked in the same way as the combat log).
---
Would be cool if someone could check that on the Beta and report it accordingly if need be.
---
Ass heal priests...
---
they heal with their behinds?
---
that sounds less than holy 
---
ass holy? lol
---
You cannot keep dots on raid bosses due to the 16 slot debuff limit. RIP Afflocks.
---
I already have a full grp and we planned our path already, since we all know what we do i expect us to be 50+ on the first weekend with some pre raid bis from BRD.
---
Most imporatnt is a gull grp of 5 and a schedule everyone is commited to. Then you should be 60 in about 5-6 days played at an sligjtly above avarage skill lvl
---
That Night Elf will be forced to buy edgemasters and use that as his glove slot for ever. That is essentially what you lose by going NE warrior : a glove slot.
---
The automated control on that would be queues. Queues can be kept to a minimum since you can spin up 100 "virtual" servers which will then down the line be 10ish real servers.
---
And if you think that the destruction of world coherency is a made up "feels" problem...then I think you and many people on this forum are far too off on what makes vanilla WoW good to even have a rational conversation.
---
I too will be playing after the kids are in bed. Adulting on point!
---
Hunters can get assigned utility tasks like kiting adds and stuff like that though, iirc. So definitely a unique raiding experience in that regard.
---
yup thats the one, thanks
---
Well yeah, it was bad, and they made it even worse.
---
It's like they said they'd stab us with a knife, we complained, so they said OK and pulled out a shotgun instead.
---
Not true at all. There are many good axes and daggers and maces.
---
that's actually kinda smart as hell, I'm gonna steal that idea.
---
&gt; Do they not also maintain Corruption and Immolate as well?
---
...no? You don't use DoTs in raids because only 16 debuff slots.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Lol what about AQ20 axe? Zulian Hacker ?
---
they should probably allow them to wear plate helms for safety sake lol
---
Not true, some areas while questing can be really hard
---
Hey both factions can have a great time!
---
Dwarf. Mage/lock would be gnome
---
Crul, AQ20 Hatchet, Zulian Hacker.
---
Is this true for both Frost and Fire?
---
I feel like it would be near useless. Blood fury still probably better - horde rogues don't poison their mainhand so you can get windfury
---
you'll have to-do lists. but you're making your own one, instead of the game dictating it.
---
I've never played horde. I have no idea what their quest focus on. Cleansing the earth, kill all humans, control nature, etc. No clue. 
---
Lot of the alliance quests I've seen are like "We lost some shit, go find it. A monster ate it, cut them all open" or like "That's where evil lives, go kill 20 evil and come back"
---
See, I wasn't aware of this. Makes sense to me.
---
I have no clue what you're going through but if you just started taking medicine against depression and anxiety it is common that it has no effect the first 2-4 weeks. It can even make things worse the first couple of weeks before starting to work.
---
Not true at all. Imagine thinking taking less dmg was harder on healers.
---
Can you post a screenshot of the file?
---
I expect that group of people to be ahead of the curve leveling anyway so they'll likely group up together.
---
I played a Druid back in the day, up through TBC before I quit. I really have struggled with what to roll this time through. I had narrowed it down to Warlock or Druid and I am going back to the Druid. Why? I love being able to do a little bit of everything. And I love being in a class that isn't popular. It just fits me and I know what to expect. Sometimes, all you want is to go home again.
---
Yes I will when I get to a computer
---
Yeah, having it all within 30 feet was very nice.
---
&gt;Do you not think they want a perfect launch experience?
---
What are their shareholders gonna think when people are making articles and making hate threads on the forums because people cant play the game?
---
You want to let the shareholders make the game? Lmfao.  Yeah, let's enjoy a mobile lootbox extravaganza.  Do you hear yourself?
---
&gt;If they dont have layering, they need to create more realms just to satisfy the huge spike in players at the launch, 2-4 months in when most of the people "just checking out the game" are gone, theres gonna be tons of low / medium pop servers that are considered "dead
---
Hence the server cluster idea to make this as painless as possible when servers need to be merged.
---
Going from 300 weapon skill to 305 weapon skill means vs. lvl 63 mobs...
---
1. ...you need 6% chance to hit instead of 9% chance to hit to cap your chance to hit.
---
2. 40% of your white swings are *glancing blows*. There is nothing you can do about that. They deal 35% less damage. 305 weapon skill reduces the penalty to 15% less damage (5% less at 308 weapon skill).
---
  That is an increase of ~ 9.3% when it comes to your white auto attack damage.
---
3. ...the enemy dodge chance decreases from 6.5% to 6.0%.
---
Lots of people (probably myself included) will be DPS spec for raids, but tank dungeons because it's doable and faster group form times/the ability to reserve highly sought items.
---
Lol, I'll admit I have before, but sometimes people are dicks just for looking for help. Actual conversation I had
---
"Can someone come help me? Getting corpse camped by 3 alliance"
---
"Lol, pvp happened on a pvp server, stop complaining."
---
"I'm not complaining, I just need help"
---
"Should have rolled on a pve server if you can't handle pvp."
---
"I'm literally trying to recruit people to pvp right now."
---
PUGs likely won't come close to the timer either.  I remember that one taking up to 2 hours.
---
He can always steal one point from somewhere to go 1 point in flay. But that is a debuff slot I think.
---
It's not my idea, it's something some private server elite guilds keep doing.
---
nobody thinks that, you are misunderstanding what people say
---
Most people are excited about the world and leveling being challenging, everyone knows raids(especially the early ones) will be a joke
---
3 Warrior DPS sounds incredibly slow before like lv30-35. What's the reason behind going 'melee cleave' or 'spell cleave' exclusively anyway, and not mixing things up? Sunder Armor?
---
I would have guessed Druid tank - 2x Rogue - 1x Mage (water/portals!) - any healer could do better, but I haven't tried anything like that.
---
It depended on the server, I rolled on a highly competitive new pvpserver where ranking was a joke. For r14 you needed 1.5m honor, on my previous server it was 500k I believe.
---
I supported 2 warriors to rank 14 on that server as a healer and only hit 11 myself with +- 10 hours a day premades. If I wanted to rank up I needed to respec Ret for more honorgain but I was also raiding which I loved more so I stayed holy.
---
What does hashtag showtooltip actually do in a macro? Why not just go with the /cast stuff.
---
This is obviously a joke post, but Ferals can and will be able to tank in classic. One per guild is actually advantageous compared to having another off-tank warrior.
---
People saying layering kills player interaction are delusional.  You can't interaction with *anybody* when you're in a sea of chaos just camping mob spawns and spamming auto attack.  Think about it, how many meaningful social interactions do you have in a big real world city crammed with people?
---
You CAN tank as any race but your threat takes a big hit. 5 weapon skill is basically +3% hit and a large increase om glancing blow dmg. To make up for lack of 3 hit, you need to wear three more hit from gear or like edgemasters. Either way, you devote more gear slots to threat gear , making you less tanky. Go try to make a gear set ypu might use as tank with 6 hit, vs 9 hit. Its a big hit to your mitigation.
---
Rich chinese
---
The current "standard" for Blizzard is a dumbed-down trash game for the masses.  The industry standard is pay to win awfulness.
---
The whole point of CLASSIC is to go back to the way things were.  For the most part, you can't pick and choose what that means without ruining that concept.
---
Here's the thing though.. maybe you didn't top heals, but we love having you with us. Battle rez! Innervate! Paw buff! Tangling roots one mob while the other gets BEAR FORM! Moonfire spam! Dancing Moonkin on the mailbox!
---
So I guess I'm the asshole, even though you obviously have zero clue how fear mechanics work.
---
And no, Curse/Method don't think going Berserker Stance removes fear either.
---
Reddit at its finest.
---
Why not? Swords are bis for human rogues. Daggers are bis for non human warriors.
---
&gt;You kick the body of the goblin with a strained grunt of your sword and look around breathing heavily. At your feet, the remains of your enemies pile up. The air in the old mine is now silent and heavy, no trace of the hectic screaming and clanking that has accompanied you for the last hour. You sigh and pack a pile of candles in your bag - which is far too small to hold more than a few measly scraps of cloth, a few chunks of copper ore and the thick candle stumps. As you feel the warm light of the evening sun on your face again, you decide to take a short stop at the Goldhain Tavern and treat yourself to a cold beer. You do not have much money, but you deserve your beer after work.
---
Damn, google translate really has improved. Aside from the Inn name nothing strikes me as odd in translation!
---
If I ask myself what would be better for *my* gameplay experience: Not being able to play, eternal queues, server merges, or the fact that some guy gets his arena master ahead of time - the answer is obvious for me.
---
I think that most people would be ok with a tank that explains that he's gearing for dps before the run starts.
---
feral LOL
---
You pretty much roll shadow priest, respect holy at 60 and get insta invited to the top guilds on the server. Not sure why people have trouble deciding... lol
---
It's on a repack server of the 1.12 client but with beta XP values. I group everyone up and do a route with only fedex and kill quests (collect 10 of X quests are a nightmare), so it's not that much slower than your average levelling guide. As a group you can do much higher level quest earlier which might help on launch.
---
Nice, ignoring my argument and playing it on emotion. Now can you go back to the discussion?
---
The fire mages can get pretty heated though.
---
Wow, idiot just blindly charged into a full pack + pat while people were still getting mana /ressing?
---
Seems like he came fresh off the boat from retail imo.
---
Nice job! Do the questing routes start after you finish the starting zones?
---
You shut up about the sun!
---
I believe this is the case as well but it sure has been a while.
---
For fishing I open up the sound options and mute the music and ambiant sounds, and max the effects sounds. So that way the fishing splash is loud as hell and I don't have to be looking at the screen. 
---
Works until someone comes and fishes next to you, their splash is just as loud. 2 nights ago this friendly fishing buddy kept trying to fish next to me and I had to keep running away. He was ruining my workout.
---
He was specifically talking about artificial lag, or spell batching, saying it didn't exist. This existed in Classic due to poor latency.
---
I mean yea, it's a matter of 10 healers + 1 shadow priest vs 10.5 healers out of 11 players. A debuff slot free of SWP is a bonus.
---
but Jolly Cooperation!
---
&gt;Humans with their spirit boost are better PvE healing as a priest
---
No they are not. Human Spirit gives you 5% more spirit. This translates into roughly +5 more bonus healing when you are deep Holy and some negligible mana regen.
---
It's completely useless. On the other hand, having additional Fear Wards means you can start to put them on DPS. Having less DPS eat fears during a bossfight will lead to faster clear times and make you have more mana available for healing than 22-23 spirit ever can.
---
First they said the layering will be for lvl 1-20 zone then I read it will be layering all zone until phase 3 (BWL raid ?) so no, i will play for a small percentage of it.
---
Which part are the guild members supposed to fill out?
---
I'm imagining every Rogue main furiously trying to come up with some scathing and witty retort but is ded from the realness.
---
Most people here will tell you that the slow pace is what they want out of Classic. In the current game, since Wrath really, dungeons have been about finishing it in 5,10,15 minutes with as little downtime as possible.
---
It’s still true that nobody wants to waste time, but most of us *want* the slow pace. That being said, if somebody is a dick, can’t listen to instructions, take advice, or chill the fuck out, I may drop group. That’s not anti-Vanilla, that’s Vanilla in action. If I find that I’m playing with somebody who’s part of the dregs of the community, frankly, I don’t want to play with them, and I won’t be punished by the community for dropping a shithead group or player.
---
That’s not often though. Most people, at least from private server experience, are pretty relaxed, helpful, and open to advice in dungeon groups. 
---
However... it’s been proven that most 5-man dungeons are SIGNIFICANTLY easier than on said private servers. So, maybe, people *will* get a bit more “Wrath of the lich king” with dungeon groups. Still, I doubt it.
---
&lt;3 Thalyssra
---
This was one of the main arguments to not content phase delay T.05 Tier gear.
---
Its horribly expensive, and the 45 minute baron run is a huge skill check that most people won't pass until they are so geared that the rest of the set becomes irrelevant.
---
true, but still they happened after nerfs, kt is the one I argue Nihilum deserved, cthun I disagree because it was literally right after it, had NA gotten the fix at the same time I'd bet on then, all the other bosses were downed by alliance, the difference in totals is massively overwhelming to alliance
---
Not really. Do the math on the racial. In endgame gear you are talking about a difference of 22-23 spirit, and +5 bonus heal.
---
Having an additional Fear Ward to put on DPS is infinitely more valuable, and every raid in a game has multiple fear mechanics. Especially on trash.
---
Herbs and mining I'd do just enough to level up for the next area until you get to the more uncommon stuff. Time wasted chasing down nodes could be better spent killing creatures and taking their drops.
---
They will be choosing from the drop down menu listed below "Item Slot 1" and "Item Slot 2".  Each drop down menu gives them all raid gear options.  Depending on which gear they put into each slot they will have a decrease in points allotted to it in a serial fashion.  You can see this in the far right column 50, 49, 48 ect.
---
Perfect. To the point and efficient.
---
nO cHaNgEs
---
i mean... he's not wrong
---
FYI domestically the movie didn’t do *too* bad, but internationally the movie made a huge amount
---
What a lot of people are not seeing is that you are farming pre-BIS in a group, while everyone else is doing quests for greens. Even if it take an extra day or two, you will still be far ahead where it counts.
---
It's hard, but it's very simple. There's two different scales: Easy to Hard, and Simple to Complex.
---
For example, playing feral in Legion was easy but complicated.
---
So much this. Modern WoW is overwhelming in that regard.
---
Especially when those other DPS can also farm consumables and items, and have an easier time of it.
---
There's a reason [this](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/3123314553) was so well-known back before this repost.
---
One could argue that it is useless for you. But yea they'd be wrong, it's always nice to re-encounter the lore even when you know it already.
---
[2 months before cata launch according to this post](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/758731-Percentage-of-Playerbase-w-LK-Kill) 0.68% have killed LK HC...sooo...sure.
---
Deeply you say?
---
2 and 4 are the kinds of people I like to play with. Especially since I normally roll as tank or heals, I like to have a nice packed friends list of chill, experienced or otherwise, players that can make dungeons a good time. 
---
Also, with number 1, the tank will make mistakes just like everybody else, but they will shout down other peoples mistakes to try to wash away their own. And if the group notices, they say “that doesn’t matter, that’s not what we’re talking about”.
---
They never said layering will stay until the end of phase one. They said that's the maximum amount of time they can keep layering. It need to be gone by that time no matter what.
---
Ion said in his interview that they hope layering will be gone by end of the first few weeks. The condition for layering to be gone is exactly the population spread. If that happens in one week then that's how long layering will be on.
---
If you want to not be able to play the game - you can do it always, even right now!
---
I want to be able to play the game
---
I guess what you could give to paladin's:
---
Human: Champion's Blade - Active/Instant - The Paladin performs an Instant attack with their Main-Hand. Champion's Blade becomes specialised based on where the majority of talent points are.
---
Retribution - Champion's Blade deals a percentage of Holy Damage and upkeeps any judgements on target.
---
Devotion - Champion's Blade invigorates the target causing their stamina to act as their spirit and allowing them to regenerate in combat, deals high threat.
---
Holy - Champion's Blade becomes a ranged buff allowing you to bless the weapon of a target with holy light. Allows them to deal holy damage and allows them to heal half the damage they deal.
---
Dwarf: Fortress of Stone - Active/Buff/Debuff - Taunt, Threat Generation on Target and Gives the Dwarf an Increase to Parry for a Duration, Individual is held Stationary.
---
Epic mounts cost 900 gold (with rep discounts) roughly.  The warlock epic mount quest costs 500ish (depending on how much you farm vs. buy on the AH).  I never have a Skinner at max level so I have to buy the Black Dragonscales (for example).  You can save an additional 150ish if another warlock does the final step with you - that warlock needs to have already bought the summoning items for 150ish gold.  They summon the dreadstead, your group kills it, you turn in the quest.  Some warlocks sell this service.  Very rough numbers here, not going to look up stuff atm, I am at work.
---
So yeah, the warlock quest is very expensive, but still considerably cheaper than just buying an epic mount.  Also the epic warlock mount looks bad f@$%ing a$$.
---
Mine was “-20 dkp” strict.
---
We have meme specs right? Well hunters are the meme class.
---
&gt;Also, just looking back at Curse/Method discussions on Nef and it was talking about tanks stance dancing the fears on Nef.  So you've got some conflicting arguments there, buddy.
---
You can literally just look up the spell on classic.wowhead yourself instead of acting like a complete asshole though.
---
Just saying.
---
Yet if you grind and actually think what you're doing, you're bound to become better with those daily amounts of hours.
---
Replace friends with pricks on Horde side and you got yourself a me meme.
---
no, because no one is going to dungeon grind to 60 just to prove how slow it is.
---
I would be curious as to why? There’s plenty of camps that you can rotate from at level 40 onward. They don’t even need accelerated spawn rates.

Ehh unless they say that precisely I won't trust blizzard at all...
---
Cant argue the point so you insult. Most common strategy when losing an argument
---
This is par for the course. A lot of people are used to the fast and brainless pace of modern games. It will take some time for people to get used to how things work in Classic. We veterans need to be extra patient and give pointers to people in order to foster a nice and tight community within our realms.
---
You can't change gear in combat only weapons/offhands.
---
I've got some bad news for you, it's funny you say 500.....
---
3k players per layer, assuming 50/50 faction split 1500 per faction. Each faction has 3 starting zones. So the more popular race starting zones will have more than 500 players even with layering. NE and cow areas will have less.
---
What is the left part of the sheet supposed to be?
---
Are they supposed to fill out the whole right side with their highest priority gear? Then you want that gear/player combo to get the points allocated to it?
---
**&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;** \- Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
 
---
**What’s it mean?:**
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
​ 
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?:**
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart:**
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such **we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
​  
---
**A Brief History:**
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
Phase 1 we will have two (yes TWO) Molten Core groups. East and West coast.
---
East Coast: Sun/Mon 7:00 - 10:00 PM EST. (4:00 - 7:00 PST) West coast: Tues/Thurs 7:00 - 10:00 PM PST (10:00 - 1:00 EST)
---
Members may sign up for either that fits their schedule. Some more hardcore members should be able to raid both events with an alt/main.
---
**Guild Priorities:**
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days). The 3rd day is a flex day for outdoor bosses and possibly Onyxia. MC will be ran in two days. We ask members to try and be available at least two out of the three days.

Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
yeah, you’re not going to get 60 at 5 days played with dungeon grinding lmfao
---
That is correct.  
---
Unfortunately, by the time you see a caster, you're already in combat and therefore, cannot switch your armor.
---
yeah but you can’t change armor in combat. 
---
but yeah.
---
The idea is not that you should do it like I said precisely. It just shows that Tips had zero idea of how he should handle that, and previous tournaments didn't either. 
---
You're still ignoring one fact though, even if someone finds you with /who, you use hearth and you're clean for 10 minutes. If they find you, get a summon, get another 10 minutes. While they duel, the summoning team moves at another point.
---
It takes a bit of brainwork to make this kind of event happen smoothly. Those streamers didn't think any of this through. That's my point. If we can find better ways in 10 minutes talking on reddit, it just proves they didn't do the most basic research.
---
How did you change the XP values? Also, isn't the armor/hp of elites more on the privatservers also?
---
What you're saying doesn't make any sense. White hit are around 50% of your total DPS.
---
Yes, they are.  Then depending on how the gear is ranked, I will have a "master sheet" that will take everyones choices and compare it to each other.  Therefore, not every player will be choosing the same gear so some cells will be required to be blank in the master sheet
---
Yeah so you would have to make a call pretty quickly, see a mage put frost armor on.
---
See a Druid put nature armor on
---
See a warlock put shadow armor on
---
And hope they don’t have a pocket rogue
---
I am saying you are wrong because my "idea" has been done before.  We know what the results are and they are the opposite of your opinion.
---
If somebody is a decent person who plays their class well and puts in effort, I'd happily bring them along even if they do play a 'suboptimal' spec. Out of 40 people, a few ele shamans, feral druids or ret paladins aren't going to break the raid. Playing only a handful of specs because on paper they do the best dps takes all the fun out of the game in my opinion. And at the end of the day, the game is supposed to be fun.
---
&gt; You're still ignoring one fact though, even if someone finds you with /who, you use hearth and you're clean for 10 minutes. If they find you, get a summon, get another 10 minutes. While they duel, the summoning team moves at another point.
---
How many Hearth locations are there, can I just park a troll alt at each one with some help from my troll friends?
---
Correct.
---
If only I could be so grossly incandescent!
---
Not berserker stance, berserker rage skill is what removed it. My question was if at a point they removed the requirement to be in berserker stance to use berserker rage to be immune to fear. 
---
Finally dug some info on stance dancing
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Stance_dancing
---
And originally it did require berserker stance to activate.
---
Like I said, when the content was on progression we were in MC and tanks were discovering tactical mastery to save rage so they could counter mag fears.
---
I look at the vanilla db versions of berserker rage and it has no stance requirement, has no rage cost.
---
So, I was asking because what I recall from first hand experience is not something I really paid attention to as patches came for warriors.
---
As a warlock I was only running threat meter.
---
It makes the icon be the correct image with proper cool down counter etc.
---
Community is more than just chat though. It's seeing the same person on the zep/boat day after day, or running into people again and again throughout the world too. It's casual contact as well as purposeful contact.
---
Ele shaman is UNREAL once geared tho tbh. And until you're in naxx, it is 100 dps difference dude.
---
On the master sheet do you want both items to have the same point value or are they being split? Or are you only looking at the items in combination?
---
Blizzard has confirmed that layering will not move out of phase 1 and they are looking to remove as soon as they can.  It will realistically be removed in a month after launch.
---
I did think of dungeons. So far, they're incorportated in the zone. 
---
When a human enters Westfall, there's some blabla about Defias, plus a tip to go and speak with Gryan Stoutmantle to uncover the whole story. When a tauren enters Desolace, there's a text about Maraudon. When an undead enters EPL, there's a mention of Stratholme.
---
I agree that it leaves a lot of lore "inaccessible" to a character. But if you're a gnome going to RFD, you can probably squeeze most of the relevant info by just reading the quests :)
---
Subscription models have always been fine
---
Sure. If you wanted to. That said, most people wear armor that gives them stats they want - attack power, crit, etc. In classic, only tank warriors wore full plate - and even they sometimes swapped a few pieces for leather etc for threat.
---
So if you're a warrior fighting in pvp, chances are you're already wearing a mix of plate/leather/etc. So its not a question of "Plate vs non plate", but a "Stats you want vs resistance". Stats = more dps, more hp. Resistance = less dps, less hp, but you take less from 1 specific magic school.
---
Might check it out, but I figured healer mana would be the limiting factor for sure, especially with 3-4 melee DPS 'tanking' simultaneously with no shield in Berserker stance etc. And you don't really scale well past 4 mobs, so it'll be inefficient to pull multiple groups most of the time.
---
Do they also leave all of the grey loot on the dead mobs?
---
2g for repairs isn't bad, you can easily get more than that by vendoring your trash drops.
---
No.
---
They did it in retail too, that ended well 
---
Good day sir, I hope you enjoy the wonderful full cost respecs of classic
---
My kids still get up at the same time whether they have daycare in the morning or not so for me that's still a no.  I imagine other kids might sleep later though so this could be a thing for some parents.  I guess my kids are just natural morning people and are up by 5:30/6 am whether it's a weekday or weekend, lol.
---
Note that Atlas already does this, but it'd be cool to have it on this addon as well :D
---
Homie! 47 days &lt;3
---
So when a class have a unique feature the game is unfinished in your opinion?
---
Asocial. Not antisocial.
---
If I can play two characters as good as two people each play one character they're shit players
---
"Exploiting dungeon drops" you mean running dungeons?
---
How does it not change that?
---
The downsides are:
---
\- Blizzard doesn't know the amount of players that will play. With layering they can quickly add more physical servers and add layers to existing servers.
---
\- How do you stop people from hoarding on Blackrock 1 (because streamers, guilds, friends or because it was the first in the list)? Disable character creation? Then people wouldn't be able to play with friends.
---
Well certain items are allowed to be placed in the same row, some are not (depending on their superiority).  Therefore, each item if there is one in each column will get that same allotted amounts of points.  I.E. if "Item Slot 1 A" and "Item Slot 2 A" are both filled they will each get 50 points allotted
---
I wouldnt count on that 25% to save me in any encounter, is what i'm saying.
---
I stand by that statement the complaints against boxers are from children jealous mommy and daddy won't let them have two wow accounts.
---
You're the second person to point it out so I looked it up. The wording is weird but I think it's group only. If so, it's really disappointing. Still, you're a good dps, but...
---
Sorry, not really. I am pvp illiterate. I root, heal and run lol.
---
[Apparently they respawn too quickly in Classic.](https://youtu.be/YnVruwCeLJs) He said more, but I haven't really looked into AOE leveling, so didn't listen to all the points. Linked the video interview for you if you're interested in more detail.
---
Probably work fine for duels, but most PvP is too dynamic for that.  Half way through fighting a Warlock you're going to get Aim Shot crit for half your health in your garbo shadow resistance pieces.
---
Resistance stacking works a lot better on Paladins and Druids because they already have great tools to aid their stacking and aren't gear dependent.  As a Warrior, you're going to be gimped as hell.
---
The healer would be a priest with 5/5 spirit tap, getting the killing blow every pull.
---
This isn't an issue restricted to classic
---
As a healer I'm afraid of the first dungeon when everyone will still go retail-style and blame me when everybody will die. I think I am going to wait a bit that people will learn the hard way then will check how it goes
---
Hearth and fly to another zone close to it without inn, your lvl 1 troll char won't have the flight path, or you just walk through lvl 20-30 mobs to find a duel zone further away and the lvl 1 troll char dies repeatedly if he wants to come too.
---
Plenty of counterplay
---
Well, maybe someone out there has a spreadsheet we could use to validate; just like you, I am only going off of firsthand anecdotal experience as a warlock in what was around the US 9th guild back when TBC was retail.
---
As you brought up, it's a lot easier to lose damage from player error with Affliction, so that could be one explanation. But, it would be nice to get some numbers on the topic, with appropriate gear sets for each spec.
---
I shall attempt to track down some spreadsheets when I'm back at home; I'd like to know where the breaking point is assuming player competency and proper gearing..
---
If you download a repack you can change the XP values in the config files to be more like beta numbers with the 2.5xp dungeon elites. The armour values are going to be off + mob abilities etc.. so it is not going to be exactly the same. Still I get to practise the route, so I know every quest off by heart come launch.
---
Druids are completely fine at tanking, there’s just a specific set of farming you need to do for the best gear.
---
don’t forget about mr smite
---
Someone on r/wow recently posted how was great because "theres so much do to", and then listed dailies type shit (WQs etc). I cant wait for them to play classic.
---
As others have pointed out, you can't swap in combat meaning you not only would need to know in advance of combat but also make a decision quickly enough before combat starts.
---
Not only this but you will find gear that has resist as well as hit/crit. So you would have to swap out specific slots in order to avoid sacrificing important stats.
---
Lastly, if you were going to gear yourself against all common casters you'd need a frost set, a nature set and a shadow set. As well as your regular set and possibly a tanking set. You've now occupied half of your total inventory with sets.
---
I'd go as far to say gas the gnomes, if they didn't already do it to themselves in gnomergan.
---
But hey, no need to kick a gnome when he's down.  I don't need to stoop down to their level, ya' know? Sometimes you just gatta be the bigger man and rise above their genocidal tendencies. I always try to keep my head up and avoid looking down on such inferior races.
---
I did a sunken temple dungeon yesterday (as a priest speced shadow for leveling), I got invited because a warrior of their group left early in the dungeon. After a little while in the dungeon another warrior of our group suddenly disconnected and never came back and we had to invite a rogue (something about the warrior quest in there that he might have been satisfied with once he was done but it could have been something else).   
---
The dungeon went rather well, no wipe just a bit of death on a 4 dragon pull when the warrior DCed. On those P server many people are familiar with the quests and dungeons which helps a lot cause I barely ever ran those back in the days and could not remember the details. We did the statue by activating in known order, communicating and placing ourselves in the different corners, overall it was a fun experience if a bit draining as always.    
---
There were a few pull where I was a bit mana strained but nothing too bad, an afk smoke/whatever time, got two blues and my priest quest reward so it was pretty worth it.    
---
Sort of vanilla as I remember it where I always wonder how those people would fair in raid where you need to be engaged for quite a while or maybe that is the reason so many ends up wanding or autoattacking.
---
No one is?
---
Really the only reason to stack resistance against a caster isent for raw damage output right? Frost resist to resist that frost nova. Nature resists to resist that entangle roots.
---
&lt;From The Ashes&gt; are recruiting for classic. We were always a Horde, mediumcore raiding guild on Bladefist EU. However, with Classic. The majority of the core (who quit either Cata or WoD) are back for Classic. And we are 90% sure we will be Alliance this time around. A change of scenery!
---
We plan to raid 1-2 times a week. Have fun. Take our time. We are a majority UK &amp; Dutch, with some Swedish &amp; Danish. 
---
We used to raid twice a week. And did pretty well with it. This time around. We dont have as much time. So likely raid 3 times a fortnight. 
---
Discord will be messy. It will be loud. It will also be fun and full of banter. 
---
We have around 40 the core involved. Hoping to boost that more!
---
Here is a stupid video we did a while back!
---
https://youtu.be/YQA5KvjuBqo
---
https://youtu.be/qh35s6M2rfg
---
I've got a repack, could you specify what you changed and to what? :)
---
Exactly what it says, shows the tooltip of the first (IIRC) spell/ability in the macro. Otherwise you get no tooltip at all for the macro. I think it also enables the macro showing the cooldown (assuming OmniCC or similar), range and gcd on the toolbar of the spell.
---
If you have say a castsequence macro or one that utilizes modifiers to cast different spells you can specify \\#showtooltip AbilityName to show the tooltip for that specific spell.
---
Sounds pointless. You'd ruin your damage output too much for it to be worth it.
---
I understand that. I should change the title really to stop confusion. I meant I am rolling as priest. not implying that this is a consequence of rolling a priest.
---
Gold is so inflated now.  I pay pretty casually and I have around $100k on every character.  I don’t even try to make money.  All the quests reward around 20 gold and the vender trash is worth like 5-10 gold a piece.
---
I have mining and herb as professions, but there are so fucking many nodes everywhere that I just ignore them for the most part.  I won’t even bother with a node unless I’m practically going to run over it anyway.
---
Everything is just given to you for free.  Even “epics” are given out as low level quest rewards.  
---
Can’t wait for Classic.  I’m going to drop Welfare WoW and never look back.
---
This is not entirely true. If you make yourself known as an outstanding pvper team player - you will get yourself invited to the best premades. Being in premades leads to more wins per hour and more honor farmed per day. This can make getting to rank 11 or 12 very doable for someone with a full time job. Maybe 3 hours a day playtime?
---
Now you can clear scholomance to do some alchemy.... yay
---
Unless you join a party through battle net friends or maybe in /trade you stay in the same layer with the same players, so why would layering change the leveling experience and people you meet while leveling ?
---
Also afaik you have a fixed layer, and when you change layer by joining a party you'll go back to this layer once you leave said party.
---
So ? How does it change that ?
---
This really went on and on didn't it. 
---
My take away was: Druids are Awesome!
---
&gt; You cannot respect
---
disrespect
---
Exactly, on my to do list is getting exalted with timbermaw for the trinket, it's not really a good trinket I just really want it and I love the whole felwood/winterspring/moonglade tunnel area that they live in.
---
Missed a golden opportunity for a Druid healer
---
Run heroic 5 man. Get badges. Repeat a lot. Buy raid gear. Never step into raid.
---
\- Mega servers will also hurt this magic. It will become faceless mob
---
\- Huge queues will also hurt this magic.
---
In fact, for magic to work, servers should be rather small (so you can memorize players). But that would not be the case for classic launch (otherwise you will probably end with dead severs after 50%+ stops playing)
---
So, no solution will allow for magic for launch.
---
I have the option for 3840x2160 in my 1.12.1 are you saying it’s because I played stress test ? Somehow the retail client affects the old client? 
---
Curious if you could go in more detail
---
used his BiS lists back in the day, they were fantastic (and really the only good place for concentrated rogue info at the time)
---
Female night elves dancing on mailboxes are ok.
---
The rest we should work together to physically remove those elune fanatics.
---
WSG and AV first. AB is the following phase.
---
Yeah I agree, the trade offs I’m imagining would be terrible to your damage output. 
---
What if you had the minimum amount needed to resist a frost nova? Frost resistance (poor) to (fair) . Any idea what that number would even need to be?
---
I want in. What’s the reference here?
---
Uhm that's why I don't really find joy in raiding anymore. I can see the lore of content in lfr, I can get the recolors which sometimes I like more than mythic variant. I can get same power in m+ farms sooner. And high keys plus the leaderboard are there if I want to challenge myself.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
i, too, have seen the luckystrike video
---
But aoe farm will not even be good as a mage from what I've seen.
---
Sure, on fights that fear... A human priest is still better for all non fear related fights. Which are the vast majority of fights.
---
Awesome man, glad to hear it's helping. What class do you think you will roll?
---
[whoops i'm playing a druid wrong](https://i.imgur.com/oMwFfEm.png)
---
am i supposed to be bad?
---
the problem is that all the r druid gearing and play guides are wrong. ht4 is not your primary heal. you should consume your own innervate. don't let memes and "common wisdom" dictate how your class should play.
---
I definitely with this statement. It will be for those that simply want the set, not those that need it, as most that need it will be able to find a spot in a raid that's been going on a while and probably pick up better gear quicker.
---
uupupupupupupupupupup
---
Not really. You think people will want to go slow on content that’s 15 years old?
---
Boomkin has spell crit aura. Hunter has true shot aura and furious howl.
---
no more dungeons divided by wings !!! or the brd 3 boss farm !!!! wooooooo
---
Allimania vibes
---
Tokens to get extra rolls in raid maybe
---
Do you want to tank? Warrior
---
Do you want to heal? Priest, or even Paladin if alliance
---
Do you want to DPS? Warrior
---
Done.
---
TBC Alliance Shaman was my goto character ever since TBC launched. I really enjoyed the Shaman, and since everyone I knew was alliance it worked out great. 
---
Shaman was a lot of fun.
---
Is there an addon for this?
---
Sometimes, before a session, I browse databases and guides and decide: 'next I gonna do this and I need to grind those mobs and do that quest'. Then I login, find myself in some corner of the world, get immersed and start doing something else..
---
I'm willing to keep the classic experience authentic. No need to come up with game breaking "fixes" just to keep people who took off for launch day happy.
---
And a WOW MMO game for you is also out! It is called "Wow classic beta login screen". You have the same chance to log in as if blizzard just did nothing about the launch.
---
Simple reason I prefer merging over layering.
---
When I log in I want to see the same players that I was leveling with the day before. It's fun to all progress together and keep running into the same players across the world in different zones.
---
I feel like with layering I won't run into as many familiar faces and I'll feel lonely :(.
---
Dude, keep it going, your videos are the best!   
---
"I'm using my pet as an ally because I have no friends"
---
I am. I still have a private server to test stuff out and to train :) Nice to be able to invite new people and make them instantly at dungeon level with appropriate gear to practise
---
They need plate helms IRL
---
Oh it isn't something you would do for levelling. You'd do it for raiding if the loot competition is too high.
---
That's what I got from [Hakuri's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrJ56pzDExc&amp;t=340s) vids (1min in).
---
I recently had the same idea. I tried it out, the only downside i found is that the recipes cost alot of silver even early game. Also it takes quite a bit of time crafting everything. 
---
So to spare time and money. It’s better to take Skinning and Herbalism. If u want Alchemy late game u can always switch it around at leven 40ish or even wait a couple of weeks at max level before switching it out.
---
Let's say it works this way, as none of us should have any proof this will work like that at launch.
---
How does that change the forced interactions while leveling ?
---
Fuck Orcs and Undead, biggest assholes there are. Never met one worth keeping his blood
---
Trolls and Tauren are cool though
---
Still rolling Druid though. Because chad
---
maybe just a big football helmet lol
---
Too few tanks, too many dps. 
---
Pretty standard.
---
&gt; whipe
---
ok stewey
---
You wanted to reward people for staying not only in the guild but for staying through hours and hours of wiping.
---
Alright. Thanks :)
---
My guess would be that allowing a non regular would not lead to overall raid progression for the guild. The other methods all cater to rewarding the performers that contribute to the success of the guild. Although it’s fair l, it wouldn’t be all that beneficial to a group focused on killing bosses consistently and faster leading to a whole lot more loot to be shared.
---
It's a lot more drama.
---
If you have someone who attends every single week for months in search for one item, and it finally drops but goes to some random new guy who is in there for his first time. The amount of drama you'd get from that would be unreal.
---
1600 is like 1 day of interest gains for them lol
---
Because it means a single person can theoretically win all the loot the whole raid, for three weeks in a row.
---
It also means someone who only attends once every 2 raids somehow magically wins the item that a veteran raider who never missed a raid has been waiting for many weeks.
---
Or perhaps you are unlucky with rolling, and you lose a roll to someone every single time. You clear entire MC, and most of BWL without getting a single loot upgrade.
---
Basically, DKP was a way to distribute loot more fairly - those who give more get more back, while still making sure loot is distributed around a bit more rather than being hoarded to one person.
---
I’ve got 64gb of ram and use 32 of them as a ramcache. Was one of the best upgrades to my pc since SSD’s came around. Look up primocache, it can work with SSD’s to cache mechanical drives if you don’t have the ram spare.
---
You're one is those clowns who didn't remember or realise that 1.12 buffed ferals to be really competitive.
---
Also you can abuse ony resets to get viskag/brut blades for every melee quite fast if you want to

Negligible:adjective

so small or unimportant as to be not worth considering; insignificant.
---
I know english guy.
---
I would take 2 points away from your disc... Inner Focus and Improved mana burn... and literally put them in anything else in the holy tree. (another point in spell warding and 1 to divine redemption)
---
Ya but something tells me that's not the only stupid thing these people buy. If their spending 1600$ on a tiny model, just imagine their opulent house.
---
Thank you, this is a really nice video. I got a question.
---
Why the macro for Cleave is different from all others on that screen?
---
Another dad checking in. That's a hard nope from me. Kids don't care whether it's the weekend or not, they wake up about the same time. The only added play time during the weekend that I have is **if** I can play during nap time. 
---
Once the kids get older it's a different story I'd imagine but video game time will fluctuate about the 2-3 hours a day max until probably teenage years, but I don't know for sure, mine isn't that old yet. Of course all of this hinges upon being present in their lives, you of course could play absentee father and get those sweet epics easily.
---
Retail is empty so they have to fill the world with npcs and tell you everyday how special you are even though you ultimately never did anything. 
---
-„Welcome Champion! Here ya go save the world again!“
---
-„actually I just payed 60$ to get this guy to 110 but yeah whatever“
---
In retail you can also become a champion but for real people in your guild, on your server because you are a killer in pvp or because you are the only one who has every enchant recipe. Hyped for this.
---
If it was going to happen, we would have had news by now. At best you can hope for a reboot of the movie franchise by the late 2020s. The current movie series is dead before it started though.
---
Saved, thank you
---
And vanilla is now 14 years old. It's old school.
---
Oh ya, but much easier in a group. I'm planning on helping other warriors do the Cyclonian quest too as a public service :)
---
18k+ responses is probably as good as we're going to get. I'd take the info with a grain of salt as I am sure things will change once the game actually launches but it's pretty cool info.
---
https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
I just find this really ironic, because blizzard fixed this by implementing Valor points ect and then everyone whined about it when it's clearly an issue.
---
Everyone should have a fair chance at loot. If I joined a raiding guild and became their best healer for an entire raid and finally got my shot at a big upgrade but lost it to some shit healer I'd be really upset.
---
&gt;I don't think the pserver community looks too kindly on druid healing
---
Yeah, information is great, but it's this kind of elitism what makes me roll my eyes.  
---
If we listen to those folks, our only choice is dwarf priest.
---
Yes, western plague lands at the farms, blizzard style
---
I did the timer with random pugs more than once (0 raid gear), it's not very hard.
---
Cool dude
---
I get what you're trying to convey, but why would the size of the server limit my ability to befriend and "memorize" people I interact with? I interact with strangers consistently and still maintain the cognitive ability to remember not only my interaction with them, but their faces and names.
---
Also, I don't think mega servers are a solution either, but they're a better solution than sharding, and I'd prefer hundreds of smaller servers to a mega server. But let's entertain this for a minute.
---
For example: I live in Brooklyn. When I go to work, I see my neighbors, same people walking to their jobs, and my coworkers. But I see the same people because we live near each other, "log into life" at the same times, and, for example, go to the same bars. I see new faces along the way, but I only interact with them when I need to or if they're in my way. But, I REALLY like my bar friends, because well... I just do. But, we don't call each other. We don't text. Hell, I don't even have their cell phone numbers, but when I go to the bar, and I see them there, we chat for hours and drink with one another like old friends.
---
Brooklyn is a pretty big place, and I still see the same faces consistently. But Brooklyn is still only a small part of New York City, which is only a small part of New York State geographically. So, who cares if I don't meet every single person in Brooklyn, New York City, or New York State? Or in parallel, everyone on the server? I don't want that. I want my bar friends. Those are the people with the same interests as me, who log into the bar at the same time, and share in an experience.

Rolling for loot is typically reserved for pugs or when a guild needs say 7+ non-guild members to fill out a 40-man. DKP is a way of people getting loot for attendance, while still allowing people to get gear if they don't attend every raid.  Some guilds may also "punish" a member by deducting some amount of DKP. The only reason I mention this is the "MOAR DOTS" Ony video because he calls out "That's a 50 DKP MINUS".
---
If it was always rolling for loot, you run into issues where some people might hit a lucky streak and win 3-4 items in a raid night. DKP helps spread the wealth across the raid. Since you earn DKP for each raid you show up to, bosses downed, etc, the people that continue to show up will earn more loot than ones who only occasionally show up. But the ones that occasionally show up, can still get loot, albeit not every raid. Straight rolling is also harder to keep track of in a 40-man raid.  
---
At the end of the day, every upgrade to a raid member is an upgrade for the guild.
---
I'm acutely aware of how slow it sounds, but still not sure how slow it really is.
---
I grinded once with only class quests. Was meditative, but got bored out around 45..
---
Most people don't think so :(
---
haha nahh he was a good tank, we just fooled around a lot in ZG in particular.  in our guild we'd clear BWL in 45 mins, then clear MC, then go wipe on onyxia because we were fucking around :D best raid times of my life
---
Or when they go balls deep in enemy lines
---
CHAAARGE!!!
---
This. People are going to realize this isn't retail in like.... the deadmines. Pally Tanks? No. Just no. Warriors? Threat is a concept! One that matters! Healers? Yes, you actually CAN run out of mana. DPS? Wondering why that mob is attacking (therefor killing) you? You blew it up too hard, yet not hard enough.
---
The game is going to sort itself out because you can't play the game wrong and faceroll. That's like..... 35% of why the game is great in the first place.
---
False
---
Dal Rends... Those are hunter weapons :D
---
Source?
---
Found the Blood Elf player
---
Totally agree with everything except that last sentence. I want to be that small % of druids who did the research and understands how to be a decent DPS and one of the best offtanks to bring to a raid.
---
Yes woflshead is most certainly mandatory and is the BIS helm for cat damage in vanilla. If southwind helm had all of it's stats doubled then wolfhead helm would still be far superior.
---
Really good recipe to get ultra salty when despite all that shit you still don't get the legendary drop and massive drama ensues.
---
Imagine being so entitled, short-sighted, and impatient that you need to play a game immediately, then base sweeping gameplay decisions on THE FUCKING STARTING ZONES and possible queues of unknown significance that might exist temporarily.  I am not trying to say *you* are those things, mind you, just commenting on the frame of mind you contextualized.
---
I do appreciate that you are trying to compromise too, but I think it's a self correcting problem that doesn't need layering.  People will level up one way or another.
---
hahaha i never noticed that!  it needs that sound effect from metal gear solid
---
&gt;I just find this really ironic, because blizzard fixed this by implementing Valor points ect and then everyone whined about it when it's clearly an issue.
---
​Not really. Valor rewards were limited, and while they helped you if your item didnt drop for X raids in a row / you lost item for X raids in a row, raid loot was almost always superior. DKP was still very much needed even during badge days.
---
&gt;Everyone should have a fair chance at loot. If I joined a raiding guild and became their best healer for an entire raid and finally got my shot at a big upgrade but lost it to some shit healer I'd be really upset.
---
If you became their best healer for entire raid, you will have enough DKP points to get the item you want. If you dont, that means the "shit healer" was with you the entire time as well, and deserves the loot just as much. If he's truly shit, he should not be in the guild. If he's in the guild and raiding, then you need him. If you need him, he deserves the loot.
---
People like you ("Im best healer, i deserve this over him") are why so many guilds go for Loot Council, and why there;s so much drama when officers/etc keep getting all the loot. No offense, but that's how your comment sounds.
---
You know who cares about top guilds? Top guilds. It’s a game, games are meant to be played at the pace/style of the player. There’s going to be plenty of gamers enjoying the game for other reasons than being the first guild to _____.  You think people need to play the way you THINK they should play?
---
You got me.  
---

[Source needed]
---
Doesn’t ryhme tho
---
you got a video of this??
---
With a good tank you just hellfire everything. 
---
Sac the imp and aoe the packs :)
---
Even only being able to play 4-5 hours  a week? I'll look into that. thanks!
---
Night elf hunters are trash at pvp. They're like a free honor kill 9/10 times if you can open. I've charged ones before only to realize that they were 5 levels above me, and still won. The dwarven hunters are usually the more skilled of the two.
---
Gnome mages are generally are also trash at pvp. It's the opposite of human female mages, who are very good. Escape artist does not make you autowin against warriors, you tiny little plebs. Genuine skill does.
---
Completly agree with that. I would also prefer merging by far.
---
However, layering might not impact this too much if its disabled for level 20+, but we know that Blizzard won't do that. I am 100% sure that we will have layering active while the first rag kill takes place.
---
If layering is limited to 3k per, that's not enough. A server with 3k provides very little interaction
---
It's not as crazy sustain DPS as shadow, but it's a spec that allows you to do good burst damage with PI, you have more survivability because you can renew/flash heal yourself and if you get crits gain more armor.  You're still raid viable because you're bringing improved spirit (not really needed though if you're try hard and killing bosses in less than a minute) and power infusion to pocket on a mage when they want a DPS boost.
---
I'm running retail on a FX-6100, 4gb RAM and Radeon HD 4250. Low graphics, window mode (1024x768), getting 30-40fps. I don't have any issues playing the game.
---
Your job is to cast innervate and give other healers mana that can’t perform their healing rotation correctly.
---
There is no better fun. There is only fun!
---
Is Classic using all of the retail macro functionality?
---
but there were other videos that weren't that bad and misleading. its really frustrating
---
Dynamic respawn seems like a better option. 
---
This will also give you a more accurate idea for how crowded the server is and who is on it.
---
I'm interested in the downsides for this version. Economy issues for people farming quick respawns in the first leveling zones?
---
Fun is fun is fun fun?
---
Imagine I am playing vanilla non layered.  Throughout leveling 1-60 I run into player CoolGuy 8 times.  We become friends.  He is the player I've ran into the most.
---
Now, imagine there are 4 layers.  Since both myself, and CoolGuy are placed in a different layer each time we log on or join a group, the odds we are in the same layer for each of those 8 encounters are 1/4, or 25%.  In other words, with layering, I only meet CoolGuy twice on average, not long enough to form our friendship.
---
Then you remember that CoolGuy is person I ran into *most*.  So yeah.  Layering destroys vanilla.
---
I love how a simple phrase like "felwood/winterspring/moongladr tunnel area" can induce so much nostalgia and, I dunno, comfort? It just makes me feel really cozy when I know I'm gonna visit this area and befriend Timbermaw.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
1024×768, 30-40 fps, that sounds like a problem.
---
If they sleep till noon, I doubt so. Children needs lots of sleep at this age
---
Certainly, but forums will be shit, just like they were in 2005
---
Don't get alch.  
---
You will need a profession slot for tailoring if you are playing a warlock.
---
Plus, every raider or pvper should have engineering.
---
Herbing is also a necessity for raid consumes.
---
Um...are you paying attention? The hardcores are sharpening their pitchforks and lighting their torches over layering, combat distance leeway, and the messed up batching re-implementation. Not to mention the hardcores are the ones who have been playing on private servers for years. If Blizz fucks up classic with layering, you'll see private servers welcoming their players back with open arms and shiny F R E S H servers.
---
Umm, I'm at work so I didn't watch it, but this one seems to be it. Somewhere in the middle he uses the rotation and pretty much spams 1k2 hits.
---
Sure, if you just want a version of blizzard that gets you killed a lot and uses tons of healer mana.
---
taking care of the kids and house to 100% the days before so wife does it first week and let me game :)
---
And it gets the added bonus of being less catchy than Analysis Paralysis. ‘Paralysis by Analysis’ is possibly the worst form of that concept.
---
Odd, I can't say I had much issue with the average Vanilla PUG group. They're generally more attentive than a retail one. You get some bad apples but you remember them.
---
The trend is, people that never played on classic 2004 or modern private servers love layering.  How do they even understand what they are asking for?
---
hah i was a mage in tbc and without ice lance and water elemental i just cant play mage in classic.
---
The original plan was for ALL classes to have racial stuff. Only Priest ended up with them.
---
That's what I meant by unfinished. Stop putting words in my mouth.
---
And yet I see an absolute boatload of them.
---
The ingame rain for minutes, nothing else, then, the music tunes in again.. zen......
---
Having a sit down discussion with my wife outlining exactly what WoW Classic is and why she won't be seeing much of me anymore and that I love her very much and will miss her.
---
you didn’t post a video
---
Must be possible with a well optimized well coordinated group? . Hardly any travel time, exp all the time. I just don't understand how it can be so slow
---
Vanilla will break 60% of people with or without layering.
---
Most warriors don't even own a shield lol
---
because that fucks up communities
---
Enhancement Shaman are bad in vanilla, and cannot dual wield.
---
&gt; Succinct
---
TIL
---
God yes, please bring it back.  
---
Windfury crits looks so damn lame in the classic beta
---
Jesus, how many forms are there?!
---
But we're not saying that, you are.
---
To most of us, people wiping in DM is very relevant, and that's OK and part of the appeal.
---
Know your class, know the encounter at the time.  Send mails requesting trials. Good players will always find a raid spot.
---
Most people will say, “play what you want to play!” But your concern is realistic. If you’re really concerned, I recommend choosing a different class to main with. Try warlock! Still a caster, still lots of perks. Also, mages are probably tied for the best alt a player can have. Hunter being the other, solo farming Mauradon for gold.
---
In TBC, tranquility healed through walls. Did Prayer of Healing and Tranquility work like that in Vanilla?
---
I don't know because I was dps.
---
Yes, let's just make up things that make no sense to strawman so we can continue our narrative!  
---
Seriously though, 3k is a HUGE number when you're talking about the first few days filled with tourists and everybody taking off work to grind the first couple dozen levels.  
---
Have you seen pservers over the last few months with all the tourists trying to get ready for classic?  They have massive dynamic spawning and *still* you can barely start a new character because of the shear amount of people everywhere.  I had to make macros just to target the flight master in UC because he was literally untargetable with all the people standing on him.  
---
By the time 3k people on a realm is not enough, it will be gone from the game. Period.
---
I had the bright idea to play riflemen in a HUvHU the other day and I got assraped so hard, you could smell the shit in the loading screen. Defend really is a sick ability.
---
This is pretty accurate, lol. You sit there waiting on the autoattack timer and pray you get a triple WF Crit. 
---
9/10 fights will result in you slowly hitting like a wet noodle and/or getting kited into oblivion. 1/10 fights will result in you getting a triple WF crit and taking some one from 60-70% to 0 instantly.
---
Yeah and the Casuals will still play the game......The biggest issue is people are remembering what classic was off of vanilla private servers which made a bunch of bad assumptions and are wrong the majority of the time. Oh well it does not match your hacked up version of vanilla wow. Go back to the scum servers that will likely get cease and desist notices now.
---
I’m going to stack up on tissue boxes and only work out my right arm 3-4 weeks prior to even things out once Classic has been our for a month
---
Honestly you can take pserver out of point 1 and it makes the list just more accurate.  There are elitist jerks and people who know their shit, but have some patience.  Both are high knowledge/skill but one is mature.
---
First, guilds usually take around 6 mages to a raid. So even with high population, there is a proportionate demand.
---
Second, mages are highly preferred fps for dungeons. Particularly BRD where there is need for high air and control.
---
Last, it might be slightly harder to find a group, but its not impossible. Every class has its draw back.
---
Horde scum!
---
Jokes aside hope you find some nice people to play with?
---
same here! will use my holy days to power level myself to 60 so i can play later a bit more casual
---
In his defense, apparently Blizzard agrees.
---
That's what will suck the most about classic. Elitists reserving everything
---
I had a reply for glancing blows but people said it was incorrect.  See the replies below for the correct maths.
---
Why are you allowed to say why’s ok and part of the appeal and I’m not?
---
Why is your view of the game the right one and not mine? This is my point.
---
it amounts to wasted time when seconds count
---
His name is perfect.
---
Doesnt matter since thats when you finaly realize your class is still shit, even if u have all epix. Id rather take 1 rogue epix than full druid... 
---
P.s i had full epix druid in vanilla.
---
Seriously?! 50k for a suit of prop armor, for that much you can purchase elaborate custom made armor
---
&gt; All of the other utilities you listed sounds great on paper, but in actuality every single one of them are gonna be done by another class or **spec** that does it better. 
---
Nice reading comprehension. If your group needs more than 2 battleresses, then you're probably not using them right, or you need more healers. The solution to this issue is not to bring in a low dps spec. Genius btw.
---
Indeed, I met plenty of great people on PServers.
---
&gt; "Wow, players grouping up to complete objectives and adapting to the game. Better get rid of this". - Champion of Community
---
That is a pretty disingenuous take, but I think you already know that. They were grouping up and dying, because the mobs were 6 or more levels above them. It wasn't like they overcame a challenge with clever use of mechanics, they were trying because literally everything was being camped. It was not successful, and they were not succeeding. 
---
&gt;Blizzard has a million times the resources as pservers. They should be able to make enough servers and direct traffic to prevent serious issues. If they do their jobs, it could be smoother than any pserver launch.
---
I don't know if you are in IT or just have a poor understanding of how it all works, but you are essentially saying you are pro layering here. That is what "enough servers to direct traffic" literally is. If you mean actual named separate servers, layering is the solution to *prevent having to do that* as it is more disruptive when they inevitably have to combine said servers.
---
Playing in a guild that allows cats means you won’t have high quality Warriors and Rogues.
---
Just play what you want and what you´ll enjoy the most. Unless you are hardcore (no life) raider.
---
I wandered through Nagrand at night on acid, and the sky was like ..you know, not blue like in daytimes with the green grass..
---
I’m going to force myself to do some kind of meal prep for the first week of launch. Also, I’m trying to get in shape (relatively) prior to launch. Better shape = more energy = less downtime between quests!
---
People want mages. Have no fear. Also, a lot of people will have a mage alt for gold farming.
---
Just join a group ffs. Why potentially cause you to wait even longer?
---
if ur playing alliance warrior 100% play gnome. escape artist is probably the best racial for pvp in the entire game. easily get out of nova or roots. you wont believe how much you use it in pvp.
---
Notice I said "with a good tank"
---
Never do this with a bad tank and always have your finger over your LIP button.
---
I've never been much of a pvper so I think most of my time will be spent leveling with some farming mixed in. Rolling a mage. with tailoring and enchanting. Just trying to decide whether or not to roll an Alli or Horde. I don't have any friends that play any more and have been horde since I started but Kinda wanna try alli for once. Might just boil down to flipping a coin lol
---
1) you don't think this is a bit of an exaggeration?  I mean I know that I, for one, will probably cry myself to sleep if I don't kill wolves as fast as possible.  Gotta have them sweeping game changes so I can kill those wolves and kobolds!!!
---
2) this sounds fun to me.  More fun then normal 1-5 levelling.
---
3) I have not said this was a huge issue with layering, although I'm sure there will be people that hit 60 before layering is done, and able to abuse it in any way they can.
---
The sad thing is that Druids are as close to true hybrids as we have, besides warriors.    Their dps, healing, and tanking isn't optimal, but they can at least do it to decent standards.
---
&gt;I know it's kinda early to ask that, but i really want to play mage. My biggest fear is getting to 60 and then realizing that no one wants a mage.
---
It's not BFA... play decent and people will want to party with you. 
---
Spam arcane missiles as frost and people will not want you... not the class
---
Every class will be needed after the first month when 70% of the playerbase quits.
---
God, this is spot on. The facial expression in particular.
---
Keeping this short:
---
21/30/0 if you actually want to play as a hybrid.
---
stat prio (IMO) is like int (until 5k mana) &gt; spell power (until at least 100) &gt; everything else
---
Stormstrike is not great, 20 second cooldown, can miss and be dodged / parried. Big mana cost.
---
With 5k mana you can actually heal and spam purge and support your team. With a nice bit of spellpower + the 21 point elemental talent, earth shocks crit for more than they would with stormstrike.
---
1h + shield for warriors / rogues. Spell power dagger enchanted with 30 sp is best. Kill with shocks and lightning shield and chip melee damage.
---
2h for low armor targets obviously and with 5k mana spamming shocks will be your filler as you wait to rng someone.
---
Of course you can still go stormstrike spec and gear like a warrior and try to one shot clothies with just windfury and that's fine. But you won't have the resources to sustain a long fight or support your team.
---
Here's how I'd do it:
---
You roll shaman.  bring warrior buddy.  setup totem fort with at least SoE and WF, maybe searing and mana/health spring if you want.  you pull mobs with LB (and ES if they are a caster) INTO the totem fort with your warrior buddy waiting.  he cuts everything to pieces while you melee, F1 frost shock runners, toss a heal, cleanse as necessary and you keep goin till objective is done or your oom.  
---
fun anecdote:  just wrapped up the beta, rolled an enhance shaman.  some of the most fun I had was "healing" instances with 4 arms warriors.  there really wasnt a tank, but shit dropped so fast due to WF totem, sweeping strikes, and cleave it didnt really matter.
---
There are other factors. I love doing group content with groups, I've actively raided retail on and off since TBC (I played actual Vanilla, but was part of the masses who got to 60 but never raided). So I love grouping with people, even for elite/hard quests.
---
But I like being self-sufficient as well, and having the ability to do a lot of leveling/quests solo if I want, and only Hunter offers the same option of independence leveling. But Hunter is what I actually mained in Vanilla, so I'm looking for something different.
---
Guzu didn't have battle shout vs the SL lock in round 1. It's a buff from the blacksmithing trinket: Glimmering Mithril Insignia which grants fear immunity for 30s and shares the same buff icon as battle shout. https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12733

**Loot System:**    Loot List / Loot Council. Brief explanation- All guild members will  create a small list of items they want from each raid, rating each item  as they wish (This is a one time list, created before the first guild  raid). A master list will be created and sorted by each individual's  rating multiplied by their attendance %. Each time an item drops, the  member at the top of the list will be asked if they want the item. If an  item drops and the list is empty, it will be distributed via the Loot  Council. Direct Message me for more details.
---
**Raid Times:**  Monday, Wednesday 7-10 CST PM. The raid will stop at 10:30, guaranteed.  The first official guild raid will be scheduled in late October or early  November to give our members \~2 months to reach level 60.
---
**About Us:** Casual/Semi-Hardcore is subjective, so let me break it down for you.
---
* We  are a new guild (30 members) that is focused on PvE progression. PvP is  welcome and encouraged, but the guild's priority will be raiding. Drama  will not be tolerated. Age doesn't matter, as long as you act  like a   mature adult. We plan on experiencing all of the content, even  if it is   at a slower pace than others.
---
* If  you are a working adult or a student that wants to continue to focus   on  your schooling, we may be the guild for you. We will not be pushing  for server firsts, demanding quick leveling times, or requiring    attendance/consumables.
---
* We  are only raiding two nights a week, so the raid will be built for the  best chance of success. Attendance/BiS Gear/Consumables may not be  required, but they will be considered when building the raid and  distributing loot.
---
**What We Provide:**
---
* Experienced leadership. Our raid leaders cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx (Up to 4 Horsemen) before TBC released.
---
* A  relaxed and mature environment. Jokes, memes, and rippin' on each   other  in good faith are fair game. Racism and the like will not be   tolerated.
---
* Guild first mentality. There will be a lot of dungeon grinding and quest help
---
* Our discord will be full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, raiding, professions, add-ons, etc..
---
**What We Expect From You:**
---
* Mature  attitude. Be willing to help others without being condescending. Be  willing to receive criticism so you can learn and make the guild  stronger.
---
* Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* Discord  - you are not required to be vocal, but it is expected that you are  listening to the raid leaders and responding if necessary.
---
* When  it is raid night, we expect you to be there on time, with the proper  PvE spec, knowledge of the fights, and a mature attitude.
---
* Loot isn't your first priority. Loot comes slowly in classic, the success of the guild will provide loot for everyone.
---
**Class needs:**

Frontshread doesn't work on beta. Or so I've heard...
---
in a perfect world
---
Everyone was so nice and very proficient on the beta. People were calling targets and ccing on every pull, even in deadmines. Vastly different experiences in two different ways to access classic....so we will have to see how release is.
---
Yep it makes sense.
---
Ty!
---
Split the difference and play the true thematic Tauren Shaman.
---
I feel like that is extremely cruel.
---
But at the same time they won't know until they experience such vast disappointment first hand.
---
Let me know when I need to start preaching to him the Church of Elemental.
---
I assumed 13th in the us since they didn’t specify. Unless they specify a specific date/time will be different for us it’s safe to assume all dates are for the us as blizzard is in California.
---
I’ve rolled both horde and alliance for a long time.  
---
Better visuals while levelling for Alliance.   Their capital cities, I find, are more aesthetically pleasing and more organized. 
---
Horde has way better racial passives for PvP and PvE.  
---
If you go horde just because its “edgy” and “cool”, thats so cringe.
---
There are twice as many mages brought to a raid than warlocks.  There are not going to be twice as many mages as warlocks.  If anything the overpopulated classes will have an easier time getting into the raid as they are more sought after.
---
Both are strong in pvp. Orc for stun resist against rogues (outright wins the 1v1 and most rogues straight up avoid orcs), warriors, paladins, and grenades. 
---
Cow stomp is incredible for 1v1 against most classes especially casters. Enables a pummel, stomp, pummel which is a long lockout. Also a decent form of peel for a friendly healer. 5% hp ain't bad either.
---
Pve side orcs are better at duel wield due to axe spec with deathbringer and crul and blood fury. Cows can still be competitive if you are willing to farm and buy edgemasters which are bis until cthun for duel wield. 
---
Cows are on a more equal footing in pve with 2h since axe spec is taken out of the equation. The 2 weapons of note are bone reavers and untamed blade.
---
Hope this helps, I've played a ton of orc warrior and have a good friend that loved cow warrior.
---
Oh my god, I can't believe I remember this. I think my best friend showed it to me. He musta killed a lot of kittens grinding his pally levels.
---
Sick! This is exactly the type of stuff I'm looking for - thanks for making this!  
---
Sort of in this vein, I seriously wish there was an addon that would play voice acting for the quest text from quest givers when you first accepted the quest. It's annoying that when someone tried to do this in retail a year or 2 ago that Blizz shut it down. I feel like that mixed with what you just built would be pretty dang ideal...
---
If you don't spec into consecration you have literally 0 aoe skills, only 1 way to apply dmg instantly (judgement) which has a 6 second cooldown, and your righteous fury builds threat off of your holy damage (which is mostly proccing off of your auto attacks), its not a good kit.
---
Keeping single target isn't TOO bad with taunt and all, but you have to admit the kit isn't great. You have tons of survivability but little for keeping threat.
---
They can restore any character that was created after June 2005 when they implemented new their database replication.
---
&gt; Blinkstrike 
---
isnt that a tbc boe?
---
I'll try to track the AH if possible.
---
Play the class you enjoy because they’re all different. A Druid is a fantastic tank for dungeons but they’re not as good for raids. Having said that, a good Druid can definitely off tank in raids. The “optimal class” arguments exist even to this day in retail.
---
There's no way I'm going shadow weaving holy unless my guild pays for my respecs, because that spec is completely unviable for every other aspect of the game it's not even funny.  Other pve specs are at least good in other PVE scenarios, but SW-holy straight up sucks for everything.
---
I'd rather put one SP in my raid if we had enough warlocks for SW to be worth it, otherwise just do without.

---
Mmmm, interesting. ty!
---
tl;dr pls?
---
&gt; One last example including a streamer: Streamer get's ganked and camp in Badlands, It's by a streamsniper but at this point it isn't harassment. Eventually the streamer is able to get away and Hearth, and heads to a new location on a new continent, let's say Silithus. Then this ganker, via stream sniping, shows up immediately and ganks/camps the streamer again. THIS is harassment as defined by blizzard in the blue post that I linked above.
---
No it is not. Your example is a gank occurs on Day X in Badlands, they hearth and then go to Silithus and are ganked again. So ganked multiple times during 1 single day. 
---
Blizzard states: "If someone made it their mission to constantly kill another player (e.g., following them around and killing them whenever they're online, day after day, over a long period time), that could make it extremely difficult for the victim to play. At that point it stops being PvP and becomes harassment. We'd want to hear about it and would, at the very least, look into the matter."
---
Their definition literally includes the words "day after day, over a long period of time". It doesn't say multiple locations anywhere in the post. 
---
I think you are greatly misunderstanding their post. Harassment to them is activity spread across a long period of TIME not locations.
---
For the most part no that isn't acceptable but subjective to how big of a role you are to the raid/guild.
---
Simple example: this would not be acceptable for your main tank have anything less than 100% raid attendance
---
You can just tell that deer is OOM too
---
It sounds awful ... But try playing a mage.

---
I think just reducing the amount of layers would be nice.  Even high population servers feel like a ghost town in almost every zone.  Maybe just reducing the amount of phasing and increasing the number of players on each one would go a long way to improve the feel of the game.
---
making friends and having adventures together
---
Fear not my good man mages are common yes but they are also in high demand
---
Yep, i need to think about it!
---
Lmao Jesus his elitist pity party shit has got to go.
---
If you do, would you please add options like preferences for mobility, least downtime, higher APM, etc. Thanks &lt;3
---
it's also fun when a hunter in your group runs out of arrows and starts to use melee attacks for the next 1 hour
---
I really enjoyed the format and presentation of this video, very very slick. I think the only flaw in the video is listing Level 12/13 rank gear in the BiS column. While I’m sure it is technically accurate, the chances that the average Druid has this gear during phase 2/3 is basically 0%. It would have been cool to use the “alternate item” format to list other pieces of gear in lieu of PvP items, including items like forest stalker bracers.
---
All in all though very well done.
---
You use MF to build the 5 stacks, there's nothing else you *can use*.  MB will take too long to ramp up, and you can't use SWP (debuff slot).  Then you use MB to refresh SW, even untalented the CD is short enough.
---
They seemed prepared to deal with trolls and interference, hence why they started moving locations. The discuss this among all of the participants ahead of time and had measures in play to make it as smooth as possible. The tourny wasn't called off and it was all concluded in 1 streaming session. 
---
Even if you hosted it, I don't see what you would've done differently? To implied that they weren't aware of the issue and didn't have discussion about before hand is naive, especially since they stated that on stream.
---
......oh. Feelsdumbman. I'll edit it and add the link lol
---
No really, continue please. This is just awesome.
---
1) It's not.  Go start a character on a pserver (which has dynamic spawning btw) and realize how bad it can be with just 100 people in the same zone doing the same quests.
---
2) Standing on top of a spawn spamming auto-attack is objectively not fun.  You probably wouldn't know though, because you've never done it.
---
3) I don't doubt people will be 60 before layering is gone.  I don't doubt it will be abused to some extent.  The difference is that these are temporary issues that happen in isolation, not issues that impact every player at the start, again once the realm dies out, and again once it's merged..

Yup. August 27th. (Technically August 26th at 6PM EST, I think?)

Hahahaha I loved tanking as a Gnome ;)

Hey I played osrs too! 99 hp ironman btw :p if you wana group up, I'll be playing alliance rogue and getting into many shenanigans! Thinking of making a guild, and eventually posting to reddit a massive excell sheet I'm making to help me level from 1-60
---
Which is still off topic but let's go for a last one
---
- you may not meet coolguy 8 times but you'll meet more players from your server. Is it better or worse ? You do not need to see the same Guy over and over to remember him, questing together for a while should be enough. Friends list are also a thing so you may want to add coolguy and play with him later
---
- the random layer isn't confirmed. When they talked about it at the classic summit they said you should still meet the same players as you level. What is the most trustworthy, the tech goal or how it worked on the beta when they first tried it ?
---
If you don't see him while leveling anymore, so what ? There will only be so many players leveling around your level on your server with a similar place than yours 
---
If you don't see coolguy anymore, you'll meet other players, and you'll have another coolguy2 you met the most while leveling. Each layer will have the size of a vanilla server, you won't run out of players unless classic is a huge flop.
---
Anyway won't bother with this thread anymore, you went off topic again and again and decided it would ruin your experience, fine. Just wait until phase 2 if you can't enjoy classic because of layering.
---
If that's true than I think it's way overtuned.  Zones feel virtually empty half the time in my own experience
---
&gt;There is really no data on how layering will effect the state of a server a couple months down the line after layering is removed
---
Retail has sharding, which is similar to layering.  Anyone that has played retail knows that due to this the players around you are consistently changing and forming meaningful relationships while out in the world is a rare exception.
---
&gt;Communities are already forming, and they will persist through layering
---
??? The game isn't out yet.
---
&gt;layering makes up 4 weeks of that, what do you believe the significance is?
---
Significant enough for people to stop playing or form meaningful relationships while levelling.  Significant enough to ruin low level world pvp.  Those are two things immensely important to the vanilla experience.
---
&gt;I think most people agree (and this we do have data for) that that is a worse answer
---
We have no data on this, and this is a massive assumption.  I have personally been through a merge and it was actually refreshing. Even if populations declined after a server merge, there's an implication that population was already declining, hence the need for the merge.  In addition, people could stick it out until the merge if they were excited for the increased population, then leave shortly after anyways.
---
&gt; is far more disruptive to the community and people get very upset about losing server identity, which you won't do with temporary layering.
---
Proactive, planned merging should mitigate this (although admittedly it can't be avoided).
---
Also, I do not think you will get much of a community feel with 10k+ people scattered across multiple layers.  At least no more than you'd get merging two 2k servers.
---
Slap in a newer mid-range GPU, upgrade the memory to at least 8gb, and swap over to a SSD if possible.

You should be fine.

Ok, i didn't know about that reddit channel! hehehe!
---
Ty, i'll give it a try!
---
There are Add-Ons that I used to help track item pricing + supply. If Auctioneer does a WoW Classic app I will be using them as that was one I had a lot of luck with.
---
* watching this forum everyday finding out there is nothing new to report.
---
* deciding if I play mage or hunter, or level both.
---
Play a mage. You'll either play for a year or two months.
---
You'll have fun with a mage either way.
---
it makes sense, ty!
---
he doesn't run away though, the stun is just part of the encounter. you still get the satisfaction of killing him
---
As someone who plans to main a fury 2h warrior. Please join my group. Do zero dps idc, just be in my group &lt;3
---
You know how many people are going to burn out? A lot. They need 40 people for a raid, play your mage.
---
I look at how many factions I'm exalted with in retail on my main, and I imagine that 10% would have saved actual days of my life.
---
What is this title
---
No it doesn't. To be fair, it was kind of an exploit so I don't mind. Ferals are gonna have to levelup as a bear since this is more efficient than the usual feral rotation lol.
---
SO 30 weeks sounds about right for the average person with little time to play. ~6 months which is probably around phase 3 content when battlegrounds come into play.
---
You won't miss a beat.
---
It’s very rare that I won’t watch a video simply out of curiosity but this might be my first NOPE purely based on looks.
---
Some of us only work 40 a week without other commitments like a family etc. my 3 huskies are enough for me. I’ll have 9 glorious days of uninterrupted classic because of paid time off. You took a different path.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
It’s slower then not dungeon grinding. I don’t know how much simpler we can explain it to you. You’ll be burning yourself out on dungeons for no reason. Literally no point, just to gain levels you’d of gained quicker questing in the world much quicker. Not much else to it. This isn’t retail
---
I second his opinion. Great work!
---
Pservers are pretty accurate when it comes to server attrition over time,  3 months in 40% will be gone.
---
Are all the raids just as easy to travel to like that are for horde?
---
I think I just threw up a little
---
Yep, thats the problem i see too...
---
We'll see in a few weeks!!!
---
Sadly you're cursed forever because you cant change titles on Reddit
---
At that point just buy a new PC
---
My two cents:
---
&gt; Warrior - strong in endgame, but an absolute hell in terms of leveling (repair costs, overall slow, gear dependent) - especially if this is the first character. Is warrior really that bad as a main?
---
No. I played a fury warrior up to Patchwerk in Naxx in vanilla and I think most of the "leveling complaints" are pretty overblown. It wasn't *that much* worse than any other class IMO.
---
The worst thing about warrior, IMO, is that every spec is pretty one dimensional. For PvP you need Arms. For PvE you need Fury or Protection. There is very little overlap. Prot &amp; Fury are pretty bad in PvP, and Arms is pretty bad in PvE. 
---
&gt; Are human mages really that bad compared to gnomes?
---
Not really, you'll be fine as a human mage. 
---
&gt; Paladin - I've always been liking that class but it is just too weak in Classic.
---
Pallies are phenomenal in classic, but only at one thing - healing. 
---
&gt; Hunter - very quick to level, but no other advantages besides that?
---
More or less :( Hunters definitely get the short end of the stick in classic IMO.
---
You don't always have a warlock either, and sometimes the warlock is further than anyone else.  It's a pretty normal and considerate thing to do.  If someone wasn't even putting in the effort to get there, I would probably just find another group, but if they were on the way and I simply got there first, I would have no issues with summoning.
---
I’ve been playing WoW and working since vanilla. I’ve never burned out. Honestly the idea of burning out is an odd concept to me. That’s one of my biggest fears for vanilla ice s my raid team will spend time gearing up some people only for them to burn out and quit playing.
---
That last point is what I really hated about private servers. I am not some kind of prude or anything, but seeing kids spamming non stop racist shit in barrens chat is just annoying to deal with, especially without a right click ignore option. In classic these people will be banned for doing that shit. I liked it when the barrens was just harmless dumbass chuck norris/vin diesel jokes and not extreme racist stuff being spammed over and over.
---
Couple of points that may change (or may not!) for Classic versus pserver, or may change your view anyway.
---
Tanks swinging a 2H is not the noob mistake that it may seem like at first. Totally possible it's some warrior who hasn't played, but it could also be someone confident in their class and hopefully their healer too. 2H warrior tanking while leveling is pretty fantastic for both threat and DPS, although you do take more damage. 
---
This kind of feeds into point two, pservers don't get some of the details right. There is a decent chance that the elites or mobs were doing more damage than intended, and I believe this was a fairly common discovery among people who tried classic/pservers back to back. 
---
I know I specifically encountered level 10 wolves in Elwynn that REKT me on a pretty popular private server. I was level 9/10 and had to gouge kite them for energy regen and combo gen and would come within 1-2 hits from dying from full. On classic, the wolves got me to maybe 60%, and I was even lower level. 
---
I am happy you had a good time, and I do hope classic is the experience that everyone is hoping it will be, but don't get disappointed if things are a bit easier than you experienced on the pserver.
---
It usually is hehehe.
---
Still does in Retail, not sure about vanilla though!
---
Great stuff! I would love to use this when I play classic. Especially later when I will be playing some races that I have not played before.
---
So much salt lol.

#**&lt; Middle Management &gt;** Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild, NA-PVP, Alliance 
---
##**Loot System:** 
---
EPGP
---
We will be implementing EPGP but there will be clear priorities given to specific classes/spec/roles with our focus being on raid progression. Members will be awarded additional EP based on guild contributions, such as material farming, having all raid consumables, flasking for progression, and being keyed and ready for raiding within a month of launch. We will also be implementing a decaying element and will have clear spreadsheets detailing item price and priority closer to launch.
---
Each month players will be given an opportunity to list one off-spec item they wish to have priority on. After main spec is figured out the item will be decided on by /roll to those that have priority. If no one has priority then it is open to everyone else to /roll on. 
---
All legendary items will be decided on by way of loot council.
---
##**Raid Times:** 
---
Plan is to Raid Tuesday and Thursday with Sunday or Monday as our clean up date. 
---
Raids will begin at 9:00 PM EST and last roughly 3-4 hours.
---
##**Who We Are:** 
---
We are a group of old Vanilla Raiders who kept in touch and have played on and off over the years. As a result our core is a bit older with most of us being in our 30s. We have varied levels of experience from those that missed out on vanilla to others that have cleared Naxx. Our focus is on raiding and progressing through the content. 
---
With our home and family lives we are not focused on world or server firsts. We want to be successful in raids, but we are not a hardcore or min/max community. We expect raiders to be on time, have needed consumables, have their gear enchanted, and be appropriately spec'd. We will never dictate what race to play, deadlines for reputation grinds, or professions (with first aid being the exception). We may award additional EP for achieving some of these goals based on future needs. (Such as being exalted with ZG within a time frame for enchants or crafting recipes) 
---
We are a social group and all are welcome to apply. Anyone looking to level casually, pvp without the R14 grind, have a group to run 5 mans with, and even potentially get into raiding later on are all welcome. I can't say as a boomkin that there will be a raid slot, but you will likely be able to find a guild UBRS group and some people to run WSG with. 
---
##**Class Needs:**
---
Currently open to all classes.
---
Our focus is on raid progression and while all are welcome, raid slots will be reserved to those willing to spec for filling needed roles.
---

Lately I've been having Orc warriors rush into a boss fight or a particularly big pull and think "pop cooldowns!"...unfortunately this includes Blood Fury...which immediately "reduces healing received by 50%". they never quite understand why I'm so insistent that they not use it.
---
That's in full t2, which no one should ever use and has less int than full 51 (which again no one should ever use). In mid BWL gear you usually end up with about half a crit extra, which is pretty substantial. This kind of rockets up in AQ and Naxx.
---
Warrior is the hardest solo class in the game for leveling and soloing. It only gets easier with raid gear at end game. 
---
Paladin if you want to be a healer in raids.
---
Hunter and mage are both fine picks, play whatever race you want. They’re all good in raids and for solo leveling and farming end game. Human mage isn’t that bad and it won’t stop you from pulling solid dps in raids.
---
We don't know OP's budget or current system, but yeah a 9 year out of date CPU isn't doing him any favors at all.
---
Most economical solution would be to buy a really cheap computer with a decent CPU and SSD. Then just bump the memory up if necessary and add in a GPU.  But that's still a round $700.
---
the 5-6 days is only possible if you have the guide 100% memorized........ id doubt he'll have it memorized so the constant checking of the guide for were to go next seriously hinders the speed.
---
That's a convinient lie you made up there. Nobody really thought about anything. They just eat whatever Blizz serve.
---
QQ
---
I feel like Lock is kinda rare because it's kinda hard to play well in pvp and, requires gear. Where as a mage is super easy to pick up and play and, also doesn't need gear. Not surprised that most people take the easy road.
---
And they blame heals later... 😂
---
Well yeah, can't click the mouse accurately with a giant bear paw.
---
Warlock was my main in Vanilla and I was always in huge DKP debt because I would get so much unwanted gear. I never got a chance at contested items -_-
---
It's a Best in Slot list.  That means they list the Best in Slot items.  They don't call it a "items that aren't so good, but easily attainable" list.
---
[https://www.isclassicoutyet.com/](https://www.isclassicoutyet.com/)  
---
49 days according to that
---
I definitely do not remember lol. I think some of the raids are faster for Alliance, and some for Horde. MC and BWL are both in BRM. ZG is in STV. AQ is in Silithus. Naxx is in EPL I believe.
---
WPL and EPL are pretty close to Undercity so I think Horde wins on Naxx.  
---
I think Alliance are closer to BRM but I'm not sure.  
---
STV is pretty similar in distance IIRC. Same with Silithus.  
---
At the end of the day, it will likely still take around 30-45min to get all 40 people to a raid, no matter what faction.
---
If you want to be a mage, go for it.  I am casual and mage is a blast.  PVE is a breeze and you do considerable damage in dungeons.  As far as guilds, there will always be a newer guild that’s looking for members.  
---
And when in doubt, just blizzard the hell out of everything!
---
still wasn't a part of vanilla and it will be one of the most glaring differences since getting dal rend or HoJ will be borderline impossible outside of guild runs
---
I'm sure they will be fine, hardware-wise
---
But the world wasn't designed for this amount of people. while speedrunners, min-maxers and other people with a lot of game knowledge would be able to deal with it, regular people, many of those playing for the first time, wouldn't. And while min-maxers probably will still be playing (even while complaining) in a world with layering, a lot of regular players would be scared away by 2 hours to do 1 quest.
---
equal gear swords &gt; daggers
---
for daggers you get the aged corehound gloves +5daggers
---
at the start the rogues in a raid should just go by who gets what and what dropes first.
---
perdition's blade, core hound tooth, gutgore ripper vs brutality blade &amp; viskag
---
whatever dropes first /rnd and you know what you going to play till 5 viskags /bruality blades drop :)
---
prebis you should strive for dalrends, but since every furry and hunter also wants them maybe settle for daggers first heartseeker and alcors, both boe you can buy them. and keep farming dalrends
---
That's also a common misconception that daggers generate more flurry charges and what people fail to realize is even though you are attacking faster your offhand isn't limited from swinging so you will eat up the charges just as fast as you generate them.
---
#whooops - thank you for catching that.
---
Not even sure what you’re attempting to say here.
---
Some maybe alot are closer to alli city I believe
---
That is the downside to the pserver crowd, much like p99 it attracts the neck-beards, poop-sockers and elitists.
---
&gt;  As people start to level up
---
And also just quit entirely.  Layering exists in order to *keep populations high* even after the tourists leave.  It's literally **the thing** all these anti-layering people want, and it will come into effect when it actually makes sense (when "meaningful social interactions" actually consist of elite quests, dungeons, and things that aren't just forming a raid to get 10 kobold kills, before world bosses are around and exploitable with layering, before most people are leveled enough to have large world pvp, etc.).
---
THE STAIRS!

---
Well there were some events in classic, I remember the xmas one specifically but im not sure how fleshed out they were
---
Blizzard said Vanilla had around 3k concurrend and people where fine with that.
---
Your comment gave me AIDS.
---
My thoughts are it doesn't seem right and will definitely change the meta. But I recognize I've been playing vanilla for the past 5 years on pservers and have a skewed idea of what "feels" right. I was too young to remember technical stuff like melee leeway during vanilla.
---
All I ask is Blizzard provide concrete proof and evidence for things like melee leeway and it's all good to me.

**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Progression**
---
**&lt;About Us&gt;** &lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again. Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing different expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW.
---
**&lt;What we provide&gt;** We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate Raid Times: Our current raid times are tentative, but we’re looking at raiding Sundays and 1-2 times during the work week. Most of our members are located in PDT and CDT time zones. - Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT - Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** We’re actively recruiting all classes and specs. Our current roster is available here. docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing

&gt;root, heal and run
---
This is the beauty of playing druid. You decide when and where to fight. A skilled druid is easily the hardest player to kill in the game, even 2v1 situations you will escape more often than not.
---
Root, heal, and run may not appeal to a lot of players but for me, it's the funnest PVP I've ever experienced in an MMO. Being slippery is underrated (IMO) and Druids are as slippery as they come.
---
dailies are just so transparently designed to make u log in every single day to boost player metrics.
---
Fucking hate em.
---
Potential problems:
---
Layers are intended to be created upon population size, and not anything else.
---
Suppose you start playing immediately, and choose layer 1. By the time your friend logs in his first character, layer 1 is full. Impossible to select at all.
---
You can't play with your friend now until the server merges into one.
---
He’s wrong. Phase 2 because World Bosses. Source: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow

just realized this, vanilla wiki said it was possible. My b.
---
So why not just play modern AV then? Why being back the version of AV almost identical to the modern one and call it classic? It makes no sense. In terms of honor per hour AV is still going to be inferior no matter what. So now it an inferior BG and inferior honor and nothing of the actual vanilla epic ness .
---
What a complete waste of a BG... this is the kind of trash attitudes that all
---
Ruin classic. In the end it won’t be classic but some BS version that came after classic had already died.
---
Out of my friends only one is going to be playing classic, however he has buddies from his work that want to play and they don't know what faction they want to play leaving my buddy in an empty space of unknown faction as well. Me on the other hand already have a guild lined up to join and raid with on horde

gross

There were definitely reserve runs in vanilla. My guild sold MC/BWL raid spots with certain pieces of gear on reserve.
---
I miss mana burning hunters😘
---
No, it's definitely spiders. OP's got a real bad case of the spiders. Just, like, spiders everywhere. All up in OP.
---
“Where is the defias messenger” “which layer you in?” 
---
Seems bad already
---
YOU THERE! CHECK ON THAT NOISE!
---
I don't see it as more than a gimmick with this game - it doesn't really fit the style. Games that shine with RTX like BFV and Exodus do so because of how real everything looks, and the ray tracing adds that little extra immersion. The programming commitment for something that will be turned off by 99% of the player base just isn't worth it IMO. I have a top end RTX card myself, and the performance differences don't make it worth it unless I'm showing it off to someone.
---
No idea why BliZZArd just doesn't do this. That would alleviate like 50% of complaints abut the system by itself. If people want to switch layers just make a cooldown period of a couple hours once you log out.
---
Layering isn't to stop a funnel of people at the starting zones.
---
Layering is to prevent servers from becoming empty soon after launch, and to reduce login times upon launch. Dynamic respawns do not affect the same mechanic as layering.
---
I can see Blizz patching that, that’s a fairly serious exploit
---
Well, it all depends on how much of a lategame are we talking about. Personally I like mage for the gold making capabilities of aoe farm. Can't get a group? You always need a mage for dungeons. Portal selling is also a thing.
---
Hunters are the fastest levelers and if you are not planing to farm naxx, it's a good choice.
---
Pally leveling is the slowest (imo warrior is much faster). Only holy at 60 or maybe prot for dungeons. 
---
Warrior is slowish compared to mage and hunter for leveling. As for endgame pve prot or fury, you can always find a grp though.
---
Turns game into JOB.
---
You're REQUIRED to log in because otherwise you fall behind on your "work" and can never catch up.

Vanilla once your raids are cleared, you can log in and farm and get ahead on your consumables, or if you are not feeling up to it, that's fine you can just farm another time.
---
I log in to classic WoW as I wanted to hang out with people and have a good time. I didn't feel pressured to.
---
Most warrior players who play only prot will have a hunter alt that they use for farming gold.
---
Then don’t rush through, and don’t do the quests if you don’t feel like it. You can hit 60 passively by farming cloth, herbs, leather, ore. Clearing off be beach for fishing. Running dungeons repeatedly for rare drops. Exploring far away zones for cool patterns.  You’ll get there.
---
I'm moving in the 21st through the 24th so I'm making sure I have internet in my apartment prior to the launch.
---
You act like this is new. Mmorpgs have had massive launches and queues since the dawn of mmorpgs. Guess what, everyone made it out okay.
---
&gt; Imagine being so entitled that you want to play a game you payed for
---
Imagine my shock.
---
Hey all -
---
Last played in TBC, completed through AQ40 in vanilla, server 2nd Rag. That was 15 years ago. I’m now almost 40 with a family and a career in financial sales, and looking forward to playing again. I want to raid in an adult environment 2-3 nights a week after 7pm EST. I’m looking for like minded players to level with, gear up with, hit all the dungeons and then complete the raids.
---
I have played endgame raids as both a Nelf rogue (vanilla) and warlock (rerolled TBC). These are the classes I am debating. I was a raid leader in MC, BWL, AQ and Kara inTBC. Open to either Horde or Alliance. Don’t care about loot system as long as there is no drama. Guild and progression and fun come first in game.
---
I am looking for a mature group with no loot drama. Vanilla was the greatest game I ever played, and I’m excited to do it all over again. I was good at farming, and will contribute to the guild with potions and other help. I am east coast, and available after 630-7PM and weekends.
---
Looking forward to meeting you all! DM me
---
Auto-corrected to whip then I didnt back-space far enough lol
---
Layering doesn’t exist to ease starting zones and it never intended to..
---
Joanas expects to do it closer to 4 days now, I'm pretty sure that adding 24-48 HOURS of guide checking is enough. I used it myself back in the days and did it in around 6 days. If you add a dungeon and group quest here and there you increase the speed even more
---
Running M+ dungeon 100 times and pray the chest A: drops a piece for you, B: it's the piece you want and more importantly C: IT TITANFORGES PERFECTLY!
---
Someone get this guy a Beta Invite STAT!
---
You're ignoring the fact that you simply cannot recreate vanilla 100%. The changes being made to the game (including layering) are literally there to best emulate vanilla.  Changes are *needed* to get close to the vanilla experience, just look at leeway.  
---
No sane or reasonable person thinks login queues are "warts".  If those people want to be intellectually dishonest, put them in their echo chamber while the rest of the world moves on understanding that Blizzard is a company that actually wants people to play their game (and continue paying for that ability).
---
&gt; No. I played a fury warrior up to Patchwerk in Naxx in vanilla and I think most of the "leveling complaints" are pretty overblown. It wasn't *that much* worse than any other class IMO. 
---
SHHHHHH don't let people find out that warrior leveling isn't that bad.
---
In the beginning of BfA they didn't have anything like that. But they did introduce a system for m+ dungeons where you got a weekly reward of "titan residuum" depending on how high level m+ you completed, which when you had gathered enough could buy you a good piece of "azerite gear" (gear with class-specific powers on it, somewhat similar to tier sets). 
---
But at least it's better than a few expansions ago (wrath for example) where you got that currency from actual piss easy content (unlike m+ dungeons). 
---
Anyway, that's nowhere near the worst thing they have done to the game since vanilla.
---
lol you watched the wrong video; method guys says, I ducking quote word for word, “i guarantee you rag will be dead in a week!”
---
That's pushing it. Might as well offer them a lambo.
---
Here’s your /s, take it.

---
This is all opinion and has no basis in reality outside of competitive raiding.  I saw every raid in vanilla over 2 guilds where the first guild was up to AQ40 and the 2nd finished vanilla somewhere in naxx.  I was never denied a spot or gear over my choice of professions.  No one holds a gun to your head if you don’t take tailoring as a warlock.  Maybe they never want shadow weave gear or whatever the temporary bis stuff is for tailoring warlocks.  
---
Guilds absolutely love having a few people be the flask masters and will donate to that cause if someone is volunteering to be that guy.  We had a guild mate who didn’t want to raid at all but spent most of their time farming consumables for the rest of the raid, and we all would donate any herbs or gold to them we could.
---
Part of the fun of vanilla for many people is NOT min maxing everything, and a good thing about vanilla is you absolutely never need to if you don’t want to, and can still be successful.
---
It depends on your location.   They listed time zones and releases on the page when announcing the release.   It's the 27th for EU and actually 6pm EST for North America on the 26th.
---
lol you watched the wrong video; method guy says, I fucking quote word for word, “i guarantee you rag will be dead in a week!”
---
One thing that seems to work sometimes also is to kill firefox in the task manger and then start it again. Should pick up where it left off without the cpu hit on rendering. I switched to Ublock Origin and use the old style as well.
---
No challenging end game either! It truly is a game for the simple man.
---
Right but that same 60% are the reason we will have extra layers tipping the values of rare materials in the final zones..
---
Regardless, unbridled wrath still gives a good bump in rage gen.
---
cringe
---
Should be possible, especially if you do a few dungeon quests and find groups for the group quests in zones. Increase your exp even more since they are not "demanded" of the guide.
---
I ran in around 6-6,5 days following Joanas guide back in the day. I followed it religiously though to not waste any time.

---
This seems like one of the greatest addon ideas ever, i will definitely check this out when classic launches.
---
Yea then you will sort of start the game in a running mode:)
---
Blizzard is almost assured to get dynamic respawn wrong unless it's done case by case. Too many variables that need to be adjusted. Layering is a dagger route even though I prefer dynamic respawns myself.
---

---
wowhead is block here at my work, can you post a screenshot if its not much of a hassle, thanks
---
Yup, we just PUG everything.  It really helps when everyone already knows what they are doing, though.... Might not be the case in Classic.
---
Barman shanker for life
---
Why then are you scared of remembering all people with similar space-time-interest-etc on all the layers? :)
---
What I am trying to say is that if the server have N total players and you can remember M players, there will be more and more people you don't remember if N grows, regardless of how they are presented to you (all at once or with "batches" through layering)
---
It doesn't matter what N is - total amount of people on the server, or amount in your space-time-interest-etc region.
---
Tight server community will only grow when servers go down to the desired population.
---
Anyone who’s going back to BFA on Day 1 didn’t want classic. They wanted WoW 2.0 and shouldn’t be messing other peoples experiences for that..
---
dual wielding was my mistake, but i obviously stated that I wasn't equating low level retail with classic. I was just saying that I enjoyed pvp bruh.

Looking for (Casual) Raiding Guild
---
Faction: Horde
---
Server Type: PVP
---
Most times on the weekends, especially if we have a standing engagement.
---
Roles in Order of Preference: Resto druid is my (strong) preference, but am a decent OT and DPS as well.
---
Experience: Been healing endgame raids on various classes, mostly druid, since vanilla. Also doing some "practicing" ahead of time to adjust to downranking again, FWIW.
---
Hoping to get through the content fast enough to not get left behind, but not so fast that it isn't fun.
---
Do you think that the entirety of your social interaction within the game is formed in the first couple months?  Or maybe it's once you're in a guild, raiding / dungeons, doing elite quests and other things that actually require coordination and social interaction - not killing 10 wolves.  
---
If there was ever a time to negatively impact social interaction, it's at the start when we have 50%+ tourists who won't even be around in a month anyway, not endgame when servers die out.
---
Play warcraft 1,2 and 3. Plenty of time before Classic.
---
We're gonna have many, many months where the Classic community is stuck on a raid tier with not much to do. People are rushing to complete Molten Core within one or two weeks, but it'll be at least 4-5 months before Blackwing Lair shows up. Then after that, it's gonna be many, many more months before AQ ever releases, with only Zul'Gurub to fill in the gap. Then there will be all the time in the world to slaughter the Old God.
---
There will be so much time with not much to do in terms of raiding, and it's not like there will be Battlegrounds to fill in the gap. That only comes out by the time Nefarian rears his ugly head. (I suppose roleplaying would be a pretty good way to enjoy Classic in the meantime, but come on, the type of people who minmax the game and rush to beat everything in a matter of days are not the type of people who would want to feel immersed in a fantasy world and roleplay their characters.) That's why I can't see people who rush raiding content truly wanting to stick around, as after they clear the raids within a few days, there will be extremely large time gaps where they have, in their mind nothing to do, and they will quit not out of morale loss but out of sheer boredom since they fuckin rushed it all.
---
The casual or semi-hardcore guilds have the advantage here, as they're gonna be taking their time, and as such will be savoring their time with the game.
---

---
I didnt compare retail and classic.
---
I loved RuneScape but never thought it was worth it to be a member. After I beat all the non member quests I spent my time out in the wilderness and would often go to the starting zone and give new players some gold and starter gear and tell them to follow me to the wilderness and slaughter them hehehe. Good times 
---
Once I touched wow I never touched runescape again
---
The other guy really was upset by it though lol
---
The to-do list is still there, it’s just much shorter.  You will quickly reach the point to where your only reason to log on is for your weekly MC/BWL run.
---
Yes, it is horrible. At least I can play it until I save enough to buy a real computer and not a calculator.
---
Thats about how much time I will have to play I imagine. Im EST and on the days I play during the week ill be on some time between 4 -&gt;10 EST.   
---
if that lines up shoot me a PM! We can snail level together!

---
You're nit picking to the point of nonsense on every post. 
---
Easy fucking answer you could have figured out yourself- Every guild is different you'll figure it the fuck out.
---
It's not hard.
---
Uh, the hundreds of thousands of people crying for a decade to bring it back is probably a good place to look for the idea?
---
Greenskin is bugged. He pulls from well below the ramp up to the dock at deck level. Meaning he can be pulled from the second floor.
---
I suspect the issue is pet aggro ranges. The Pirate’s Parrot that patrols with greenskin is likely the culprit.
---
i will probably create another version of the video with commentary, stopping after each list and talking about other options as i know majority of the people wont be able to get the very bis gear and p2-p4 bis gear relies heavily on the epic pvp set.
---
Gnomes, fookin gnomes
---
&gt;Plus, every raider or pvper should have engineering
---
Unless someone is in a hardcore min/max guild this is absolutely wrong.
---
Is eng useful in pve and pve? Yes, no one can deny that.
---
Is it required to clear content or be a good PvPer? No.
---
I honestly don't get it is with some people who think everyone needs to min/max their character to do anything in Classic.
---
Min/max'ing only really starts to matter for Naxx, which most people probably won't do.
---
Nope, I don't think it's entirely formed within the first couple of months. But I do think that's how and when you find a guild, friends, and people to run dungeons with.
---
I understand that people don't want to be competing with 400 other characters for those 10 wolves. I get that. But saying that it has zero impact on anything else is disingenuous, and it moves the goalposts from "doesn't do anything else" to "really won't be that bad" to "it won't last long."
---
Source? Because this is definitely wrong.
---
&gt; The problems you lament about will sort themselves out relatively quickly in the grand scheme of things, with zero layering.
---
People quitting / not being able to play isn't "sorting themselves out" in any good sense of the term.
---
I'm not even that concerned with starting zones though, the *main* problem layering solves is servers that experience huge population drops after tourists leave.  Server merging is objectively worse than collapsing layers.
---
private server have a xp modifier of 200% for dungeons, classic has 250%.
---
less hp, less armor, less damage (tested till lvl40 maybe brd+ looks different)
---
increased xp, increased killspeed you will be at least at the same xp rate as solo questing.
---
Poor rogues, lol. I plan to do 5mans with min 3 buddies on mine. Me(tank), hunter, priest, and we'll be using ML for every 5 man. Hoping to get guildies and never truly pug, but we'd tell pugs ahead of time what's on reserve for the instant free run.
---
Sometimes I need to change the resolution scale to 50% (raiding etc). Game is like a 3D version of Tibia.
---
I hate this kind of armor, it looks awful .
---
This is dependent on lock spec as of recently, a lot of theory crafting has going into the warlock searing pain/imp spec based on the arcanite dragonling, similar to fire rogues. Pservers also have the imps casting at 1.5 firebolt per second talented when it should be 1 firebolt per second if talented so its hard to test the viability of it atm, but its outpaccing normal ruin specs even as is in aq+ on testing servers
---
Also from my time on a few pservers I can say similarly or better geared mages pre-AQ were almost always lower on the DPS table except for a few select fights. I'd say it isnt about keeping up early on, you are plainly doing better if you are playing the class well, and timing your auxillary spells correctly.
---
We still used master loot and manually distributed the items. So a "need roll" was a player typing /roll and the raid leader passing the loot to them. So we could easily keep track of who had already used their need roll and if they tried again we could just remind them they already used it.   
---
The only real flaw we felt the system had was it did allow new guild members to potentially win very rare or sort after loot in their first week and then quit the guild shortly after. We had it happen maybe twice. But a possible solution for that would just be to restrict need rolls for new members until they've been with us for X weeks or attended X raids
---
Worse than life.
---
But you can gather flowers with those paws
---
Shockadin obv
---
I'm against it.     
---
         
---
I recognize the technical challenge Blizzard is facing. I respect the talent that goes into developing systems like layering. I acknowledge that a layered server benefits a great many people to whom the negatives mean very little.       
---
          
---
But layering means I can log onto a server and not see every person in an area at once. And that's just brutal for me, as a person whose wonder at the original game was centered around the idea that there was this big world, with all these people in it with me. Now it's cordoned off with invisibility curtains for weeks, perhaps even months.       
---
I like the idea of server mergers. It's more work for Blizzard in the end, and I'm worried that's the main reason they're choosing another way. I can understand optimizing your man-hours, not taking more effort or resources to accomplish a task than you need to. But Classic WoW is, ostensibly, a work of  love and restoration for a product with great significance. Cutting corners should not be seen as a virtue here.       
---
I'd rather get a brand new infusion of players from a merged server than have people popping in and out of existence between layers as they group, quest, and raid the world over.
---
Dwarves are antagonistic to Tauren though, with those dig sites in southern barrens and mulgore. Digging up dangerous artifacts is cool and all but they could be more respectful about it and not dig up burial grounds
---
That's an interesting build, I assumed seal of command wasn't worth taking, is that wrong? Also, with redoubt are you ever swapping to sword and board? I don't run redoubt in mine but I still swap at times when I want the extra tankiness depending on what i'm fighting.

It's pvp focused as well. I was basically going for maximum hybrid, I like to toss out off heals and blessings whenever I can and went for more survivability while tryin to still put out consistent damage.  If holy shock simply isn't worth it then it probably looks pretty bad tho lol. Took vindication over 3/5 conviction cuz I figured if it's proccing enough that + improved ret aura would be better overall but dropping both for 5/5 conviction is still something I'm debating. Took divine int cuz as said before I favored spelldmg/int pretty heavy in this build. Also how do you feel about hybrid builds overall in pvp? I've found it to be lacking in solo situations but I'm not sure if that's just how a ret hybrid is in vanilla or because of some of the choices I take. Feels really good when I have people to support or vice versa tho.
---
Berserking. Just make sure to pop it when your hp dips due to some aoe attack from bosses and it's an insane dps increase. Otherwise it's just a nice 10% haste to pair with your other trinkets.
---
it works even better as the new macro API lets us shift with 1 button press. that means less autoattacks missed, no macro failures leaving us out of cat form and instant consume uses in between shifts so the chances of losing both autoattacks or missing the energy ticks is very minimal
---
I thought a lot about it, sadly. It's proven to be a waste of time though. The #nolayering crowd are a bunch of cry babies. Even server group idea boils down to a neatly optimized layering situation with worse scaling.
---
&gt;there's no reason paladins should stop casting for you, it sounds like you have weak precast game and are projecting.
---
The bigger problem is the paladin starts his cast to snipe the priest.  And yes, the pally shouldn't do that.  He wastes his time to pad his meters, and wastes the priest time with their cast and mana.
---
If you can't recognize that then I can't imagine you are a valuable addition to any raid team.  It's not about personal performance.
---

---
&gt;Layering is static, though. People will be static on your layer except for when grouped and pulled into someone elses layer for the duration of that group. I don't think people will be 'popping in and out' like you suggest, and I did not experience anything like that during the stress tests.
---
Layering is absolutely not static.  No. No. No. It *might* be static during a single play session, but even if it is, that's not the point.  If you see different people every time you log in it severely hampers the experience.
---
Also, plenty of people did experience it, there's video evidence.
---
&gt;Are you telling me I didn't find a few discord that I am a part of because of classic? That seems bold, but the game doesn't need to be out for communities to begin forming around it. Some of them have been forming for quite some time.
---
The game needs to be able to stand alone.  This is a BS answer, especially since forming bonds in-game is especially precious to many people.
---
&gt;If someone quits in the first 4 weeks, what significant role did they play in the community anyway? This feels like a huge reach because you know 4 weeks out of 2 years is really a drop in the bucket.
---
It's not the roll they played, necessarily, but the roll they could have played.
---
&gt;The community at large disagrees with your anecdote. The outcry when server mergers happened was pretty conflicted. It's pretty nice that all of that can be avoided.
---
Lol.  "The community at large.". You have no idea what you're talking about.  The community that brought Classic into being absolutely knows layering is shittier than merging.  Look at the top comments on this very thread.  Only people that think layering is a good idea are those just getting interested in Classic, and retail players.
---
&gt;Again, you are literally describing layering here. Layering is a predicted planned merge of a singular server, so you don't even have to lose your identity. You sound like you are on the side of layering, but you've already made up your mind that you hate it
---
"Server clusters" has many of the benefits of layering.  The fact that you can't tell the difference should give you pause, because the ramifications are very different, because server clusters are static.
---
&gt;Your last bit is confusing, but I don't think you fully understand what layering is? Layering isn't necessarily about overall pop, but about concentration (IE launch). There won't be naming conflicts, as it is on a singular server.
---
To the contrary, it's you that doesn't understand.  Let's say Blizzard guesses there will be a 60% population drop.  They figure to aim for populations of 3-4k/server, so they create servers of 10k people, layered 2-3 times at the beginning.
---
Scenario one.  They guess the drop perfectly. Yay! Perfect size server, no problem (other than all the issues with layering until that point), you now have a cohesive world and layering can be removed.
---
Scenario two.  Population only drops by 20%.  Now Blizzard is stuck with a 8k population server with layering.  What do they do?
---
Scenario three.  Population drops by 80%+.  Now you have dying servers below 2k pop.  The only thing you can do is merge, and since the remaining servers don't share naming pools, it's the kind of forced, violent merge with name changes everyone's afraid of.
---
Then keep in mind, all servers are likely going to have varied populations and varied declines, so you might get both issues.
---
Hey what faction were Trollgodx and trollgody on?
---
This is why I will just start my own groups. If I see a tank with a 2 hander, he's out. If I see people just attacking random shit, they're out. I will replace people all day long if I have to, to make sure I don't get a group full of idiots.
---
Like I said, I acknowledge that they may be the “best”, but when some items literally may not be attainable, some others in substitute might be appreciated.
---
I give up, there is no understanding between us on what harassment is. I spelled out plenty of scenario that clearly demonstrated the difference between just ganking and what is intentional harassment and yet you argue against every harassing action as legitimate.
---
The potential for this addon is huge, especially in the RP scene. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out!
---
On the 26th....not the 27th
---
&gt;  It has actually been pushed back a week.
---
The final stress test was pushed back a week, not the Classic launch date.
---
This has all the mob levels for grinding: 
---
https://imgur.com/a/hg6VI
---
its not, private servers are off
---
I would take anything over a prot pala in a raid tbh
---
Cool.
---
How will they patch it though? How do you make it so someone gets locked if Ony dies in an instance later on, without locking people out when they legitimately left or didn't kill the boss?  
---
The only thing I can see is them banning people who do it. The thing about this strategy is you still need to either kill Ony with less and less people each time, or have enough people to constantly replace those who dropped. Its not easily done by casuals.
---
The animations look great now. Speakin For myself, I'd love to see them added to classic.
---
Nope.
---
wow really, I hadn't seen it...
---
Honestly I would consider your original comment completely standard as part of Party Introductions
---
EMBRACE THE SHADOW!
---
Yum yum more horde scum to stomp!)
---
lol sweet
---
I was afraid that classic will be full of hardcore tryhards.
---
I dont want to play a game with a playerbase as tryhard and toxic as lol.
---
Then i went zf on a pserver and our tank didnt use abilities because he didnt even know he could go to a trainer and learn them.
---
We might wiped but it was funny.
---
Are taurens potentially better than orcs as warriors with their huge melee rang?
---
Companies care a hell of a lot more about other companies proving that a concept is successful/profitable than a few hundred thousand people crying.
---
I have a big group of  friends coming back for classic and need some advice on what to play.  We will be playing horde. 
---
My problem is that i've been leaning warlock or priest but a lot of other friends have the same idea.  I would prefer dps but also dont mind healing at 60 but want to be able to make money on my own through professions or farming.   Was a resto druid in vanilla originally until WoTLK, then switched to mage which i had played until BFA.
---
I've been going back and forth driving myself crazy so any help is appreciated!
---
1. No interest in playing Warrior or Hunter
---
2. We don't have a single leather agility dps. Rogue is interesting if only for this reason
---
3. Likely 3 warlocks, 3 priests already. 
---
4. Only 1 mage (but my best friend is rolling mage), 1 shaman, 1 druid
---
5. My friend asked if i would roll Shaman to duo level with a warrior.   Never played vanilla shaman past level 30 but this sounds interesting and i like the class fantasy of a troll shaman.
---
The tough decision is should i just not worry about what my friends are doing and make the class i want, which would probably be warlock?  Or since i enjoy being something slightly more unique, play a rogue or shaman as my main and make a warlock alt later on?
---
Okay, People seem to really not understand why layering is in and are assuming it's for sure going away. Let me try to clear things up.
---
1. Blizzard wants to keep the number of servers low, their excuse being that they don't want to have to merge lower pop servers after launch hype dies down and people quit.
---
2. Vanilla servers had around 3k people total, both factions. So Blizzard decided to add layers to the limited number of launch servers and cap each layer around 3k, emulating the vanilla server size. However, in reality the server will have many thousands more players, all divided into layers of roughly 3k.
---
3. Blizzard is gambling here. They are assuming server populations will die down to levels similar to vanilla, thus removing the need for layering. However, if populations remain high, Blizzard will NOT remove layering as that would defeat the whole point of having it in the first place and result in massively bloated, unsustainable populations. 
---
4. Imagine if the server you're on has a steady population of 20k players, and you've always been layered to a layer of 3k. Population hasn't dropped a ton and uhoh, Phase 1 just ended. Do you really think Blizzard will suddenly drop all the layering, throwing people together into that overcrowded mess of a server? Can imagine trying to farm end game raid consumables in the open world in that type of environment?
---
5. The only solution Blizzard has if the population doesn't die down after launch is to open more servers and hope that people server transfer to them. I believe it was said in the Tipsout interview that they will open more servers as needed.
---
In conclusion, you're delusional if you think layering will ever go away unless your server drops in population closer to the 3k mark. IF server populations remain high, Blizzard will be forced to keep layering as the server population will be far to high to be sustainable for the amount of players vanilla servers were designed to accommodate. Layering is a stupid idea by an ignorant and proud company that refuses to accept that a recreation of an old game will have a sustained massive population. They don't want to invest and open more servers. Remember when they tried to say that they don't want to operate two different games (WoW Classic and Modern)?
---
Let's be real here, server merges &gt; permanent layering. I think we can all agree on that.
---
TL;DR: Layering will remain permanent if server populations stay significantly higher than 3k, which was vanilla server population size.
---
just because privat servers are off on xp, hp,armor and damage
---
in classic its viable. considering in the fact you can get brd bis items with lvl52+ you are far ahead of the 60+prebis race
---
Equal loot incentives means equal.  If you're in the raid or warming the bench as long as you're there for the guild you are treated exactly equal as far as whatever system you're using is concerned.  In your system you just include benched players in the attendee list.  You implement it by just grabbing more than 40 people into the list.  
---
There are a lot of varying opinions on this, but I've found as a previous leader of guilds/raids that it seems extremely unfair to ask someone to wait for a spot all night with no incentive.  They showed up, they are ready, they spend the night ready to help and are eager to play and prove themselves.. how can you not give them something?  One could argue that they don't have to use consumables or can afk and play something else while waiting, but I've never found that quite fair to give their time less value than the other people who showed up.  A sweet spot of 'some incentive' but not all can be striked too.  DKP guilds can give 1/2 dkp to benched players.  SK I guess you could only have their spot on the list change every other time.  It's more of a challenge for the loot master to manage this way, though.  
---
Also, there need to be special rules for trials who you have benched too.  A trial or provisional player may who has not proven themselves one of the raid yet should have provisional loot rules as well.  Rules could be, you get no loot unless it's about to be literally DE'd, or you get dkp at half rate.. you don't get to move up the SK list only down (new trials enter lower), ect. and I don't see a need for them to earn loot incentives while benched.
---
Not at all. These remakes replace all the assets, models, and everything, it's a whole other shebang. What I'm speaking is much more akin to those "with true HDR" scenes. Better contrast, better shading between light and dark. Older games always have these weird areas where it's just one shade of dark in the shadows or where the sun light is either nonexistent or excruciatingly white, but the display can only go so far, it has to come from the lighting method.
---
Most of them with just some simple modification, yes. ConsolePort is planning to have a Classic version ready at launch. You can follow the progress and download the alpha on their Discord, linked on that page.
---
Dude stop. I have them distracted in my thread. Delete this asap.
---
Not sure if you have been watching the streamers, but layering becomes the culture. When it is there, players all start using it as a way to get something or avoid something, or are very frustrated with it as it just seems to be so random. It becomes part of the language, "can someone layer me in?" "need layer invite stat".
---
If they have it at launch, it will stay, I have learned to not trust Blizzard to do the right thing. I am hoping they prove me wrong.
---
The have components of brewfest already up on the beta server
---
BEWARE OUR ENEMIES ABOUND!
---
Literally nobody cares about 5 man dps.
---
They only challenging part about them is not pulling patrols in Strat Live.
---
your 10pm is my 7 pm which is when I'll most likely be getting online, damn! lol
---
Who told those people to do that?
---
His stuff is some of the only I can watch at length.
---
Cleave affects next swing. Its important to put startattack after so that cleave gets applied first so you dont accidentally white swing. Tho i do need to test it, but that's the principle.
---
I work at a grocery store and this old lady comes in every week and buys a carton of them for $110.
---
Oof.
---
Loved it when a warrior would charge up a ramp in UBRS or LBRS and LOS me and die.
---
You skill in tanking has decreased by 1
---
You die (screaming like a bitch).
---
Some patterns will be available from release and others will be added in future phases such as titanic leggings. I dont think theres an exhaustive guide available about what is available at which phase but they said they'd marry them up with patch they originally released in. So my understanding is if a pattern was available in patch 1.3 it'll be there on release, then patch 1.4-1.5 may be phase 2 etc (I'm speculating on patch/phase figures)
---
It'll be tough week 1- it's never been done and it'll be tough as fucking nails.
---
But Week 2 is a given.
---
There's a difference, he meant the one with negative connotation, which is criticism, not critique.
---
People have been wanting classic back for years, at least since Cata made such huge changes, some wanted it even before.
---
That's another issue with layering. If you arent in the mean population it's going to feel extra dead when the already thin herd is split between 3 layers. If layers werent allowed in higher zones this would allow for better population control, in my personal opinion.
---
There's only two choices Mage or peasant.
---
Yeah everyone is hyped about the 27th...but it comes out in the 26th for NA. So my hype day has been 3pm 8/26!

HEAL!

notice the word "should"
---
it is very much required if you want to be a good pvper or a good pveer.  the key word there is "Good"
---
As I've aged I've come to appreciate the Orks more and more. I made an Ork Hunter around the time my forsaken lock hit 50 just to get a breather from being squishy and they wound up becoming my main since the Rpness of an Ork Hunter just fits bonus wise.
---
So close!
---
The mobs are over here, bro! You gotta keep up!
---
It's the internet on a throwaway account I won't be using after launch. Nothing is revealed.
---
Everquest, is the father of MMO. So no runescape had nothing to do with wow.

trolling on epic levels

How does layering prevent you from finding a guild?  It's not like you're finding any meaningful group / guild, you're just playing with the people around you. That doesn't change with layering really.  I've never implied or said that layering doesn't impact things, it absolutely makes the game better during both the initial stage full of tourists and the late-early stage when those tourists leave.
---
Nobody can really say exactly what impact it will / won't have.  We don't even know what the final version of layering will be, but we *do* know some things:
---
1) Blizz doesn't want it in for any longer than it needs to be
---
2) Any version of layering that could be abused in a meaningful way (like world bosses) will not exist.
---
Fuck Orcs, all green skins need to be strung up from Stormwinds walls
---
On private servers with buffed mobs/nerfed XP*
---
I don't think that ganking a player over and over is harassment unless it occurs for an extended period of time (quote: "day after day, over a long period of time"). Every blue post on the subject agrees with me on this unless. 
---
Intentional ganking =/= harassment. You are just simply wrong about this concept. I suggest you roll on a PVE server because you clearly have never been camped for an hour in STV before. Yeah it sucks, but it's the game. Part of the shitty things about classic wow is what makes it so great.
---
Seconds almost never matter in classic. It’s no as twitchy as retail
---
You are partially correct with the hit chance. Due to defense skill being within 10 of the weapon skill 305 human vs 315 boss - you get 1% hit back that is originally ignored. The diminishing returns beyond that is significant though.  People seem to forget the 1% hit guaranteed tho.
---
L2Title noob
---
You better be stupid rich if you are trying to buy an Alcors.
---
Indeed, I see what you're saying.  I was hinting at the fact that this would be an engine rebuild to implement.  It would look significantly closer to retail than it would classic.
---
I bet retail will have some ray tracing in the next couple years though as these GPUs get a larger market share.
---
Someone is going to be last on the list.  In vanilla I think a more important metric is overhealing %, and whether anyone is dying (and why they are dying).  Being the lowest healer isn't a bad thing if you're actually doing the most effective healing and everyone else is overhealing a lot.
---
ohh they were hell bent on not doing it, even though they would make money out of it (even at a few hundred thousand people)
---
You can thank the total fucking flop that current retail WoW is for them shitting themselves and trying to come up with ways to make more money....classic was an easy one.
---
Priest is gonna get last hits over 3 warriors all smashing execute? I donttttt think so
---
No joke. Doing UBRS on my rogue, I have the dal’rend offhand and we kill Rend and the mainhand drops...and the hunter wins the roll...
---
I found some enjoyment in instances by literally pulling half the instance in one go. It was a hell of a challenge at 58 for a death knight to keep aggro on half of Hellfire Peninsula, and that iceborne was key to survival, but damn was it satisfying.
---
As someone who had 100+ days played as a hunter in retail vanilla, I would like to say that you have 2 abilities that are near critical, and once you have mastered them, you'll be good. 
---
1. Scatter Shot
---
2. Wing Clip
---
Yeah having a hemo rogue was always desired. That was my role back in vanilla and although I didn't do as much dps as most others, I was still valued. Plus it let me be greedy and stay my PvP spec :D
---
Who won yesterday
---
This is great, it reminds me of the Best Quest addon. I will use this
---
no one cares what you did over a decade ago.  
---
you want to be in a top guild? they will require engineering.  
---
no one is denying the importance of flasks.  he just doesnt have the profession spot for it because warlocks need tailoring for their bloodvine.
---
stop giving this guy bad advice.  if he listens to you he will regret it when zg opens
---
Spell stone also covers the dmg too iirc
---
yeah you'll get the bis items from BRD, but you'll get those in the first 5 runs(not ironfoe). After that you still have what, 30-50 runs to get from 52 to 60? It's possible to level that way, but I very much doubt it'll be viable in terms of speed and I can guarantee that you'll regret it after running each dungeon dozens of times.
---
It's perfectly translated, though (the grunting sword)
---
I have no idea why he would write that, but that's what he wrote.
---
It doesn’t in this situation.
---
That's my birthday. It's fun to think everything is counting down to my birthday.

&lt;Blackened&gt; EU Horde PVP Server
---
Plans for the guild: We are focusing primarely on PVE and are aiming to be one of the top guilds on our server.
---
​Language:
---
English [EU]
---
​Raid Times:
---
Raid times will be 19:00-23:00pm GMT+1 (Sweden/Germany etc)
---
Invites are going out at 18:30 and you are expected to be there on time with buffs/consumables.
---
​Loot System:
---
We are going to be using lootcouncil as a system where both Raid appearance/attitude &amp; performance will be considered. Every now and again we will also have people from lower tier ranks in the guild attending the lootcouncil on raidruns in order to secure a none biased set of opinions deriving from the lootcouncil. Meaning that the rest of the raidgroup can be assured of there not being loot missmanaged in the guild according to the loot rules stated on our forums.
---
You can read about the history of Blackened on the forums on the website, but in short Blackened is a vanilla guild that has been run by me (founder in vanilla) for many years. We have always been on the cutting edge of progress and are now looking forward to play and progress together with new as well as old friends come Classic.
---
​Side notes:Our pve goals are to kill all bosses within a fairly brief period of time from the point of release. We will also do a bit longer raids at release weeks, with perhaps an extra day / + an extra hour or two, if necessary. The plan here is to get nice fast progress with clean executions on tactics.
---
​When it comes to PVP, alot of people in the guild enjoy it. It may not be a primary concern but we are still able to host some World PVP / World events/ BG Events if that is something that is being asked for by our guild members.
---
About our Leadership:
---
Our raids will be led by a person who has raid leading experience through all raiding content there is in the game. In the old Vanilla days aswell as on private servers.
---
Our officer team consists of experienced vanilla / Private server vanilla players that has alot of knowledge about the raids aswell as guild management. They will always be available if you have any questions in the guild.
---
​
---
What to expect from Blackened as a member:
---
Slightly innapropriate humour throughout all content *giggity*.
---
Experienced leadership that knows the tactics for every encounter, and knows how to set up and prepare in advance.
---
Officer/Class leader team that is willing to teach you what you need to know when it comes to be a better player, as long as you are willing to learn.
---
A Fair and Clean loot distribution with the guilds bests interests at heart. Meaning that we promote what we said earlier when it comes to attitude/attendance and efforts within the guild.
---
​What does Blackened expect from you?
---
To come prepared for raids with consumables. To be focused and listen to the raid leader during the raids. Also make sure you have read the rules and guides on how things are ran in the guild, meaning reading the Discord sections regurarly and stay updated with signups/news on our website.
---
Also having engineering as one of your professions. Especially if you are a dps/tank class.
---
​How do I join Blackened?
---
Easiest and fastest way to join us for the Classic journey is through our website/Discord linked below.
---
You will have to fill out an application on the website which only takes a couple of minutes where you answer basic questions before joining the guild.

Lol blizzard is the source. It's a global launch just like BFA was.
---
3pm pdt... midnight wherever because that timezone doesn't matter.
---
Talking about releasing classic mate.
---
you really didn't need to do that with WoW classic though, all you had to do was look at the near constant requests for it, the amount of accounts on private servers...there was a a more than profitable enough demand for it and they just kept saying no.
---
I would also like to see them added but I guess the point of classic is to keep it as close to vanilla as possible and I think a lot of players want that. 
---
So at the end of the day I will be ok with vanilla looks and animations.
---
RotA was available Day 1 back in vanilla, so yeah it'll be there in Classic

Thanks, I see. And what about this part: /targetenemy [noexists]
---
None of the others have it.
---
It sounds like you're just dealing with an idiot.  
---
Also, what server were you on where light leather goes for 10g a stack?  It sounds like you're extrapolating pretty far there to get to that number.  Light leather goes for barely 20s let alone 10g.
---
You'll be fine, just latch on to the idea of - you aren't as strong as other classes and you won't be able to outplay them if they are at your skill level.
---
I mean quickly is a stretch, it takes what avg of 10 days of playtime to hit 60? For the average player that’s what 3-6 months post launch? Then rep grinds, pvp, alts, farming for consumables etc. I don’t think the to do list is shorter just different

&lt;Stoic&gt; - NA - Alliance- PVP
---
Hi,
---
My name is Matt (Scrumpy), I've played WoW off and on since Vanilla.
---
I am creating a guild to bring back what I believe was the best part of WoW, the community.
---
With a focus on both PVP and PVE, we plan to progress through all classic WoW content and ideally have a regular group queuing for battlegrounds.
---
Raid times: TBD, 2 days a week Monday-Thursday 8pm-11pm CST. Exact details will be change on what works for raid team.
---
Loot Rules: TBD - raiding is pretty far away.. but it will be fair.
---
For those who played during Vanilla, our lives have changed a bit, and most of us cannot play near as much as we did 15 years ago. With this in mind we will keep a efficient and relaxed raid environment.
---
But really, we are just looking for a bunch of good people who are excited to play this amazing game again.
---
Join this discord if you're interested. I will be posting more there as server information comes available.
---
https://discord.gg/JvuuKdh
---
Thanks for your time,
---
Matt (Scrumpy)
---
PS. I couldn't find a smooth way to brag about Vanilla experience above, sooo I've cleared all the raid content. And grinded to pvp rank 13 (field marshal). :) looking forward to hearing about what you all did in Vanilla.
---
Why don’t you back up that assertion, because I as well damn sure looked it up before I made my claim.
---
They touched on this in burning crusade. Blood elves got their own seal that was great for retribution PvE.
---
**INTRODUCTION:**
---
Laid back bunch of people with a serious ambition to get shit done without the bad kind of drama. Making sure that with a strong leadership: raiding, pvp, loot distribution and behind the scenes work will be as streamlined as possible so that you, as a member, can focus on your leisure time being pleasant. Building a great community is our main focus and we think this should be a core value for every guild.
---
**EXPECTATIONS:**
---
* A positive mature mindset. No SJW's or snow flakes
---
* High raid attendancy +-90%. We understand IRL sometimes stands in the way but don't become the person that makes the raid go "WHAT, AGAIN?"
---
* Don't go rogue without notice for signed up events
---
* Self-sufficiency. Learn raids beforehand, show up prepared (flasks etc) and researching your class
---
* Able to receive and give criticism
---
* No elitism
---
* Decent English, both writing and speaking
---
* Discord + mic. Push-to-talk during raids
---
* Patience during raids
---
**OFFERING:**

Like I said in my post, I was commenting on the specific issue brought up.  Reading tough for you?
---
in what world do you live? every offset leather healing item is hardly contested by shamans and paladins. the tier items not tho
---
ah i see, i thought it looked like they where trying to copy each other :)
---
Just check the damn AH.  If it sells for more on the AH minus the cut, then sell on the AH.  If it vendors for more money, vendor it.  
---
This isn't rocket science...
---
Constant flurry is more impactful on a fast weapon because of unbridled wrath rage. My point is that you get the most out of unbridled wrath when you pop reck and do a significant portion of your dps spamming execute.
---
\*Laughs in Bear\*
---
There was a single post about the damage numbers, but there have been dozens and dozens of posts about layering. You are either lying for your own benefit, or you genuinely are more blind than Anne Frank.
---
I assume you mean hardly as in highly contested , and yeah sure they may have them on their wishlist but most guilds I've personally raided with with LC will give leather gear to the leather using healer first. The paladin can use plate, mail, leather, and cloth. Their options are much less limited.
---
Read as many as you can. Don't worry about the relevant lore as they are absolutely amazing to read!
---
For example War of the ancients gives you a great insight on how the demon soul was created, how Neltharion/deathwing came to be and a great backstory for Malfurion and Illidan. Its been a while so I cant remember the exact titles but theres books regarding Thrall and how he came to be the Warchief, a book regarding Medivh and Khadgar. You'll enjoy reading them
---
nice that you can guarantee how i feel about playing a games ;)
---
you are one lucky bastard if you only need 5 runs for hand of justice &amp; savage gladiators chestplate when there are always at least 2 people needing on it.
---
that arena boss doesnt even spawn that often.
---
i rather get the items while leveling than trying to assemble groups at 60 for max 2-3 runs and adding 30min groupsearch + 30min traveltime each time
---
Mostly for afk-crafting items and selling/disenchanting, can't give away more details if I want it to remain profitable. ;)
---
LW/Enchanting is a nice way to make money just idling in cities if you don't like farming. But I'm a bit torn because I feel I need engi because I'll probably roll a hunter. :(
---
how does tri spec or disc spec scale with later gear for solo wpvp and how is it for solo wpvp? ive heard shadow falls off later in terms of scaling while other classes running around in naxx/aq40 gear but its strong enough to 1v1 in wpvp.  I mostly just want to run around and farm herbs solo so im not sure tri spec is safe for that.
---
ah since /startattack is at the end, it casts the spell before the actual targeting goes off. So that's why i added it. Otherwise you'd have to hit it twice
---
when I say get your heal out faster I'm clearly referring to either doing a better job of precasting or doing a better job of chosing your heal.
---
yeah you shouldn't snipe people on purpose, you shouldn't be casting greater heals so late that people have over a full second to snipe you either.
---
For sure. Gonna be funny tho when everyone is in AQ gear looking like total assholes and see if they still feel like no changes
---
Yes 100% and it sucks because it's not really necessary and *definitely* not vanilla
---
I try to avoid those guilds they are full of ppl you don't want to be friends with usually
---
Key is dropping all that and git gud!
---
Always stay in rested area when you log off. That experience bonus is huge.  Also if you Cairo’s somehow get Heirloom armor, that is another huge bonus.  
---
I am like you, I planned on only playing 4-5 hours a week, but this game sucks you in ....   I ended playing more like 6-8 and it took me 2 to 3 months.  
---
However long it takes, just enjoy!
---
If people truly invest into their shaman, enhancement can and will be strong in a world and casual PvP setting.
---
But people coming to Reddit asking about such general advise are not typically the ones having their road map already laid out to R13/14 + Eye of Sulfuras + 15.000gold farming route for Sulfuron Hammer.
---
But a dedicated enhancement shaman is still a sight to behold.
---
My response makes perfect sense lol.
---
Honestly if a raid/group leader is just doing a dungeon for a single item and has no other reason to be in there I don't see whats wrong with him making a reserved group. Making a group can be a pain, especially for a 10 man UBRS run, rewarding the leader with the item of his choice is a no brainer for me. If you also only needed that one item then skip that group and make your own or wait until another one forms. Many people might just need other items or just need to do a quest so it doesn't affect them at all.
---
Isn't Blinkstrike level 70 my dude
---
As a Gnome mage I've felt a lot of hate and never understood where this comes from; until Goblins joined the horde. 
---
Seeing these sleazy Jabba the Hutt uncles con there way into one of the most honorable factions in Azeroth immediately set me on edge. Between their calloused-over Ferengi faces and their snot colored heads the only thing that is worse than there appearance was their opportunistically nagging voices oozing of exploitation each time their gaping maws creased open.
---
I've always wanted the option to rise above the horde and alliance conflict, making BFA the worst expansion story for me. Orcs should share a brew with Humans, Dwarves should study history with Tauren as brethren. However, retail's quest of getting in a Dark Iron Fire Golem and exterminating goblin vermin by the hundreds was the one warcrime I didn't blink twice at.
---
Thank goodness Classic was the Era of Reason before such mistakes were made. I plan on only attacking those that attack me first. Their is honor among all the Classic Horde races.
---
Just to clarify, there's nothing like The Isle of Quel Thalas in BC? Or whatever it was called, the blood elf island with 25 dailies
---
It's not holy, but I've seen this build going around for PVE/PVP. Disc priest support with shadow weaving.

I think herbalism and mining are a waste of time on a fresh server.  Within the first 3 weeks the economy will still be maturing and nothing will be able to sell for much gold.

I will be going skinning.  Though, I don't plan on selling any of my skins to either the AH or the vendor.  I have alternate plans for my gold making that I want to keep private, because I'm pretty sure I'll have enough gold to get my mount at around level 25-30.
---
Did you even read what I replied to?
---
IF and general chat. Not even joking

I only reached level 40 or so before BC came out.  So, I'm excited most to experience the lvl 60 experience on a long term basis.  I'll be super casual, but it'll be fun as fuck.

When I was in college, my psych professor admitted to playing WoW. I Can't remember which side he was on, but there were actually kids that stayed after class to tell him he was on the wrong side.
---
go to bed grandpa
---
Once that kid is on a schedule to get up at 6-7am to get ready for school, all weekend sleep-ins are GONE.
---
If you thought the bag space was worth potentially winning a 1v1 occasionally, sure. People used to cheese shadowplay teams in arena doing this.
---
I think that layering is fine, as long as it is temporary. The longer layering is enabled, the longer those who get ahead of the curve have the ability to abuse it.  If people couldn't abuse the system for farming high end mats/etc, layering wouldn't really affect typical game play. 
---
It is better than sharding because while you are logged into your play session, it is virtually seemless. If you want to stalk player A through 10 different zones, you can. You won't cross over into westfall from elywin and have the player running next to you disappear forever.
---
Sure, you may not log into the same layer with the same exact people in it every time, but you will have your friends list.  I remember my game play in 2005. You meet some one in the world, you group up. You enjoy each others company, you put the player on the friends list. Then when you log in the next time, you check to see if you have any friends online and contact them if you want to group again. But lets face it - even in 2005 you have a lot interactions that fizzle after the first. The player you met may only log in once a week so you out pace them, or they might level faster than you and out pace you. You might get ahead in the questing in that zone so you can't really beneficially help each other any more.  
---
The players you meet in your layer will always be in your world. Your not grouping with someone and then never have an opportunity to group with them again. You use your friends list to log positive interactions so you can build a list of players you might do things with again. Did you kill boars with Player Y in Elwyn. Well now you want to do Dead Mines and look, Player Y is online and still around the same level as you. So you invite them to go with you.  THAT is how the friendships are made. 
---
WoW has always been too big and filled with too many variables that "one world" allowed you to log in and out with the same exact people to have the same exact experience every time. That never happened.
---
I have not seen it. Having never played undead but I will take your word for it mate:)
---
Imagine posting this and thinking it's OTHER people that are "spergs".
---
LMAO
---
Are you fuckin retarded?
---
Save yourself a day. Have a nice sleep, come back from work sit back and enjoy already stabilized servers. You will fall asleep soon after launch anyway and will win no more than 6-7 hours of playtime, but the price will be 1 whole vacation day, and you will pay this price by returning to work day earlier. 
---
And god knows how many of blizzard launches ended up as a complete disappointment for me because of lags and crashes. Literally, every wow addon until I quit at mop, sc2, diablo3 was a mess. Dunno about classic but why risk? Those few hours won't matter a week after.
---
For most people that play 2-3 hours a day it will take several months to hit 60. I expect a lot of the old hardcore crowd, so we’ll likely see loads of 60s within the first week. Still, it’s a challenge. Can’t just faceroll dungeons and aoe haha, I’m super stoked about that. CC and the dangers of breaking one.
---
OMG, i should have know about it!!!!!
---
Classic is going to be the Rise of the Oomkins.
---
how does tri spec or disc spec scale with later gear for solo wpvp and how good is the spec for that? ive heard shadow falls off later in terms of scaling while other classes running around in naxx/aq40 gear but its strong enough to 1v1 in wpvp. I mostly just want to run around and farm herbs solo so im not sure tri spec is safe for that... is it more of a BG group spec?
---
You don't know what "salt" is clearly, as you are using it wrong. 
---
If anyone is salty, its you over being exposed  as shitter that plays games on easy.  
---
An upcoming games' journalist is what you are.
---
Tips and tricks... interesting hahaha.
---
Lol yea you have a point lol. I remember spending ages trying to get good looking gear in vanilla for my warrior. But I guess. Part of the fun is the hardship of getting matching gear lol.
---
but blizz is way too focused on what other companies are doing, they won't even glance in the direction of the general population.  hundreds of thousands of people requesting classic is just noise.
---
that makes perfect sense. really appreciate the explanation!
---
Saving, investing, and treat your career like most of the people here treat their Wow character.
---
Honestly. That's a fair assumption. BFA was probably losing subs like crazy. Everything they are doing (beta invites needing subs) is based around holding subs till the next xpac.
---
CFS and fibro are similar in many ways. OP’s post sounds a lot like fibro to me. All the posters saying to listen to their doctor are correct, but CFS and fibro are definitely something they should mention in that conversation. Every diagnosis of fibro I’ve heard of was when the patient mentioned it. Since it’s relatively rare and can present with so many widely divergent symptoms, many doctors tend to overlook it.
---
Lol CC returns with a vengeance!
---
I’d say if anything it sounds like mage is your best choice because while gearing up is very helpful, you can still put out decent damage without having amazing gear. Other classes are not as forgiving in that area. But again, it’s always better to have better gear :)
---
Well this is how it is on PServers:
---
Dps takes only a couple of minutes to find.
---
You will get 3 whispers for the one healer spot instantly.
---
You wait 1-2 hours for the tank and he can reserve half the loot for himself.
---
Reason of course that healers can not solo farm mobs outside of dungeons.
---
I'm #4 on this list, although I don't typically dps, and I can be a talker. 
---
While I enjoyed Burning Crusade, I just hated the homogenization that was already starting, especially once Shamans and Paladins could be played by both factions. Was never quite the same after that.
---
Voodoo doo-doo: Troll rogues generate +0.5 more hp/sec while in combat than any other trolls.
---
Well this triggered me hard. I used both dal rends till I got my rhok delar in Vanilla.
---
You dont get titles.
---
The title decays, so after a couple months you are back at a measily crappy R6 to R8.
---
Gear can be obtained slowly by grinding out exalted WSG, AB and AV.
---
R12-14 gear is only accessible by the most dedicated and skilled players.
---
Freebies are plentiful in certain ways like T0,5 pieces, TuF, AV ring etc.
---
No reason to stuff people with epic gear.
---
I seem to remember EQ did some sort of "classic" treatment? I never played EQ, was into Ultima Online myself, but I went to my GF at the time friend's house and her brother was playing EQ and he was mentioned that he was playing an older revision or something.

**&lt;Pugs R Us&gt; | North America | Alliance | PVE server | PST Timezone | Casual/Semi-hardcore Raiding and Social**
---
**Who we are:**
---
A mixture of veteran vanilla raiders and new players coming back together for Classic. Most of us have raided together in various expansions, and we're always looking for new friends to play with.
---
Loot will be council based for important/critical items, but most common drops will be free roll.
---
We have an active Discord for members to socialize, with a full suite of adorable custom pupper themed emojis.
---
**What we are looking for:**
---
Like-minded mature 18 or older players who want to have fun in a toxicity-free environment. LGBTQ+ friendly. 
---
Racism, bigotry, homophobia, or harassment of any kind will receive the ol' yeller treatment out behind the barn (instant gkicks).
---
We want people who are in it for the long haul who want to experience everything Classic has to offer. From Deadmines to UBRS, to Naxx.
---
Whether you just want to be a casual social member or part of the dedicated core that helps us push to farm end game content.
---
If you want to slay dragons without having to put up with a bunch of scummy edgelords, then we're the guild for you.
---
We value dedication and it will be rewarded.
---
**Schedule:**
---
Optional activities will happen every night of the week from 7pm to 9pm (PST)
---
Our 40 man raid schedule isn't currently set in stone, but we expect it to be Tues/Weds/Thurs, with dungeons and smaller raids (once they're released) on the other nights.
---
PVP will probably happen on weekend or monday nights.
---
All roles and classes are welcome. Play whatever you want to play. 
---
We currently need more off-tanks, dps, and a few more healers. 
---
We are currently at about 20 people and growing. 
---
If you want a core raider spot, now is the time to squeeze in the doggy door.
---
**If you are interested you can message us on the following:**
---
Discord: Gundlach#0397 or Pearlite#9604
---
Or on BNet: Duke#1453 or Pearlite#11561
---
Cultured -  Characterized by refined taste and manners and good education. 
---
I would'nt called know some pop-culture as being cultured, as the adjactive cultured has little to nothing to do with the meaning of the noun culture.
---
True. Private servers have been around for a decade. They started working on them as soon as BC launched. 
---
It just took a few popular private servers to show how the pop could remain stable for quite a while.
---
Probably ally mains
---
I don't know about you but I have never been crankier in this game than when I'm playing a healer.
---
I am personally hoping non meta only guilds pop up. Not for me to play in, but I would love to see a guild challenge themselves with misfit only classes/specs.
---
Well, runecape just looks like Ultima Online to me.
---
If EA just wants to take my money, they can release a classic Ultima Online T2A as well.
---
you can always drop something for engineering later, once you are 'financially stable'  and maybe move some initial  profession to an alt.
---
"I hate so much about the things that you choose to be."
---
Well... I was on a PvP server back then. So... 😎
---
They really should have started with the Warcraft 2 story.
---
I feel like there's at least the illusion of choice in classic, and more choice in how you do it.
---
Even as a min maxer. Sure you have to farm the same. Consumables each week but. Are you minted and just gonna buy them? Will you dedicate an hour a day on free days to farm mats? Will you take a shitload of Cocaine, farm for twelve hours, then go to work on no sleep so you don't have to do it very often?
---
Naturally your raid schedule will be dictated, buy even then by a guild you chose.
---
In retail its literally laid out for you. 30 min doing dailies to get the item reward. One raid finder a week which takes approximately the same amount of time. Get your Islands done.
---
You can't buy any of the rewards from these, or somehow trade to get the same outcome. You HAVE to do it their way.
---
It's only because Asmon plays alliance and the spergs flock to him.
---
You gotta pump those numbers boy
---
Honestly I wouldn’t know, I’ve never played healer 🙃
---
Lots of the guys that trolled that tournament (yesmaster for example) have been switching from horde to alliance each private server they play on.
---
I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I think you're completely right.  If that is indeed the case I can't see myself playing Classic WoW for very long.
---
You can't make horde and alliance on the same pvp server. Horde mains.
---
Hey, I got a sweet dagger at lvl 10.
---
is missing the -0.5s off heal/greater heal not an issue in 5mans?
---
Dude here. I was considering playing a female Priest, however I struggle bringing myself to do it. Male character = male IRL, female character = female IRL, usually. I mean, that's the assumption, right?
---
If I do, I already have my name picked out: Notagrill.
---
Just so there's no mistaking.
---
Plenty of guilds clear AQ40/max without making everyone take engineering. If the guild is looking for record clears, sure it’s a big part, but those are an extreme outliers, even among those that can clear all content. It’s not necessary at all.
---
That's so far from what has been said.  They said 2 weeks is ideally when they would like to pull it, but it will go no longer than phase 1.  It will be gone by phase 2 and world bosses.
---
I really don't think classic is going to be super popular.  It's a very niche and the leveling experience is going to take so long and lots of casual people won't do it.
---
Yes I agreed with your point.
---
WoW on the 26th, new Tool album on the 29th. It's going to be a decent week.
---
I see new players being guided towards Hunter all the time because they have an easy time solo leveling. I don't often see people recommend to not roll them if you're new to the game.  
---
As it turns out doing dungeons with a hunter demands more mechanical and game knowledge than the average class.

I think *The Last Guardian (*[https://wow.gamepedia.com/The\_Last\_Guardian](https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Last_Guardian)) is one of the best ones, and also a prelude to Warcraft 3, yet has limited impact on WoW besides finding out why Karazhan is spooky.

Hey!
---
I think we might be a good fit for each other. I'd love the chance to bend your ear about Classic and see if you have interest in joining us. You can reach me at WildGunmen#9537 on discord or Wildgunmen#1302 on bnet.
---
Yea, people will say they want to play lock until they realize what they have to do to get their mount.
---
The problem for me is the drop rate on Perdition's is much higher than Vis'Kag (20% versus 8%).  I think that's why most rogues naturally end up as daggers since the game cock blocks swords quite a bit.  The good sword in BWL is only 10% drop rate too.
---
This is some pretty cleverly disguised fearmongering, I'll give you that..
---
1) I don't think anybody in their right mind thinks that servers will not have a massive 50+% dropoff after the first couple months.
---
2) It's true that even after this dropoff, we do not know exactly how many people will continue to play.  This number will become a lot more clear to Blizzard as we approach that time though.
---
3) Coincidentally, the exact number of players per realm becomes less and less important until you reach the level 60 steady state of a server.  To rephrase, would you rather have over population when everybody is stuck in the same few starting zones, or when players are scattered around the entire world at multiple different levels doing much more diverse content?
---
4) We have significant evidence that layering will not persist (in it's "current form", whatever that even is).  Blizzard has explicitly stated that layer abuse on world bosses is unacceptable.  I don't think there is a good way to solve this without removing layering.  Thus, it's a much safer assumption that layering will be removed and we will see very high pop servers, not that layering will remain.
---
5) It's a complete false dichotomy to say "server merges &gt; permanent layering".  
---
6) You completely invalidate your entire wall of text with that last paragraph. "They don't want to invest and open more servers", lol yeah OK. Blizz doesn't want to make money (i.e. have people continue playing their game).  How much do you think these servers actually cost?
---
If learning a class or specc is only about BIS lists...
---
I’ve always right clicked to start attack. It’s much more precise than having to tab through and potentially missing your target
---
You are correct, however the drop rate on perdition's is much higher than brutality or viskag, so I think that's why I remember so many dagger rogues.
---
Firstly, fantastic Reddit name.
---
Secondly, from your post it seems like we would be a good fit for one another. I'd love the chance to discuss it if you have the availability. You can reach me on Discord @ WildGunmen#9735 or  on bnet @ Wildgunmen#1302.

I don't like Humans because people who play them are boring and bland.
---
&gt;... Will you take a shitload of Cocaine, farm for twelve hours, then go to work on no sleep so you don't have to do it very often?
---
I hibernate hunter pets then roots the hunter... and /dance in their deadzone while my dots tick....
---
I'm a jerk.
---
Shaman, no doubt.
---
I'm not sure what patch you meant instead of 1.13, but all priest racials came in at 1.1.
---
This was why we never got anywhere in BWL in classic: our guild hunters secretly agreed not to kite mobs on the first boss.
---
as a tank would say " not my problem"
---
even a mediocre guild will start forcing it players to get engineering when aq40 comes out.  you use sappers on visc to beat him with one break
---
any melee not using engineering prior to aq is just flat out bad...
---
I’ve seen a few of these threads pop up, and honestly you don’t need to read anything for Classic. There weren’t any big lore storylines going on in vanilla. There  were bite sized pieces of lore here and there in the form of questchains, but nothing too important, and most of it was retconned later in books and comics.
---
It wasn’t until later expansions that you needed to read books to understand half of the shit going on in the game.
---
Don't sweat it. 95% of female chars in video games are just dudes being weird. If you want to, roll with a girl.
---
Nicely said.  I too am not interested in topping meters, but simply adding a lot of value to the group.  The class has so much freaking utility it's absurd to not want one in your party.  I'm not personally interested in raiding too, and I know that's the big gotcha for a lot of people, but it's a fun class and they offer a great benefit to other players.
---
Classic has a massive amount of returning players who never used this macro system or were super casual in the past
---
You don't even need to do this. By 1.12, junkboxes are the highest drop rate item on the pick pocket loot table and is your primary source of blinding powder. Just macro pick pocket to all your openers.
---
sul trash
---
Although no one really does BRD in one sitting still. You do X type or run. Or Y type of run.
---
Oh wow. This is really educational man, thanks a lot.
---
&gt; But layering means I can log onto a server and not see every person in an area at once.
---
This is a pro, not a con.  You will see exactly how many people you would've seen on a vanilla server at full pop when the rest were sitting in a queue to long in.
---
&gt; I like the idea of server mergers.
---
You think you do, but you don't.  Maybe if you're a very casual player who has no stake in the economy, guild rivalry, premade BG groups, etc.  Server merges kill servers.  Go back and read forums from post-merged servers, most people jump ship and server xfer entirely.  
---
&gt; But Classic WoW is, ostensibly, a work of love and restoration for a product with great significance.
---
WoW classic is a profit-bearing product.  Don't project your love for the game to Acti-Blizz, they wouldn't be doing it if it didn't make money.
---
&gt; I'd rather get a brand new infusion of players from a merged server than have people popping in and out of existence between layers as they group, quest, and raid the world over.
---
Maybe you should group, quest, and raid yourself then?  Never have to worry about the people you're actually playing with going anywhere then...  This is also completely ignoring the fact that layering won't exist when this kind of thing actually matters in higher level zones / endgame.
---
What you're saying makes perfect sense, but it conflicts with other information I've read.  If you'd review this and comment I'd appreciate the insight.
---
&gt;Glancing Blows - what are they?
---
Purple haired gibbons from under the sea. Seriously.
---
&gt;Or alternatively strikes doing a reduced percentage damage of your normal hit damage. The calculation for this is...
---
Normal damage - ((Defense skill – Weapon skill - 5) * 3%)
---
So versus a 63 mob your strikes do 70% (85% versus 62) when they glance.
---
&gt;Easy to solve - just get more Weapon skill. For your white strikes 10 Weapon Skill means your glancing blows deal full damage. That's _exactly_ the same as +12 Hit has once you are beyond mitigating yellow strike misses (and aren't beyond the '29 more crit' limit).

It's  amazing how "unfinished" classic wow looks like when we play it now compared to retail  (even though I think classic made for a more compelling, community-driven game). 
---
I know people hate the idea of changing classic, but somethings like filling out missing quests for classes, maybe some slight balance adjustments, make horde zones a bit more fleshed out I think would make classic more polished.
---
Skinning only if you're part of devilsaur mafia.
---
Domo runs away.
---
Ah true true. Forgot about the other class with the pet :P
---
That epic sword is really badass one i had it for really long time on some private servers. I never regret it.
---
I’m actually curious to see what happens with this. There have been a lot of people posting on this sub who will be new to WoW, or began post-Cata, and comment that they want something which takes more time and effort. I know.. we’ll see how many ACTUALLY want that once they’re in it. But it is an interesting point I’ve noticed skimming this sub the past several months. 
---
This isn’t to say all actually do want a grind and none will leave, I’m sure there will be plenty of those. Gaming trends have gone the way they have the past 10 years for a reason. I just wonder if it will be as high a percentage of the players as we think.
---
Nobbel just reads the books and condenses them into videos. It’s nice if you can’t afford the books or don’t have time to read them, but otherwise I would say buy the books yourself. It’s much more satisfying than those YouTube videos.
---
Yeah that would be awesome. I'm rolling a priest myself, but I love healing and always will.
---
I'll roll a war to tank here and there, but my main will always be a priest.
---
That’s a question for your guild, but it’s not like the other races add much (if anything) to PVE. It would free up one talent point to put elsewhere, as a Human with swords equipped and 1/2 weapon expertise reaches that 8 weapon skill cap, but it seems pretty anally retentive to REQUIRE it.
---
A lot of rogue damage comes from white damage, and if you weren’t a human and only had 2/2 in Weapon Expertise, 40% of your attacks against level 63 mobs (mostly bosses, I think SOME high level trash) would be reduced by 15%. At 8 weapon skill, those attacks are only reduced by 5%. Effectively, a 4% (40% x 10% differential) increase in white melee damage for the 3 extra weapon skill.
---
&gt; I want leveling to be difficult if it means trying to compete against everyone else trying to level at the same time as me.
---
So you want a full server with the same amount of people in it as it was in vanilla?  Cool, you're pro-layering then.
---
Not being able to play the game isn't a "difficulty" lol.
---
&gt; When I log in and I see hundreds/thousands of people in a single zone, you know that's vanilla.
---
You will, with layering.  Without it, you'll be staring at a countdown timer, and after a couple months you'll be staring at nothing because 80% of your server pop was tourists and they've left to play BfA.
---
Whaaat new Tool album?
---
Yeah the lack of snap-threat relies so heavily on the DPS being aware of their aggro levels. It's possible, but it requires a kind of "DPS Crescendo" where if anything is going to be hit really hard, it's best to do at the final 50% when if the mob comes off it is almost dead anyway. It's a great feeling to have that threshhold well known, both as a DPS and a Tank or Healer. It makes you notice the more attentive players, and those who rely on the Tank's Taunt cooldown to be able to stay alive as they heedlessly DPS right out of the gate.
---
This is very true, however, most of those issues are more about shady gms or being able to buy gear or cosmetics. The issues aren't regarding layering with pservers.
---
I’m assuming you are referencing the expertise talent in the combat tree. As human you can put those points into other things such as imp eviscerate etc. 
---
Additionally - even with the extra weapon skill in the talents you are still reducing the glancing blow reduction. That’s a major dps increase. 
---
If you are in a hard core raiding guild you will want to be human. The dps difference is noticeable.  That being said - will it make the difference between a kill and a wipe?  I would say in 99.9% of cases - absolutely not - but they are called hardcore guilds for a reason.
---
Yep.
---
Druid will be least played once again.
---
Let's face realities, people like topping meters, moreso now than previously. Druids, will never top meters, as such people aren't drawn to the class.

No plans to be weird here, so perhaps I will. Cheers!

I honestly don't believe hunters were ever meant for raiding. I refused to even run 5 mans on my hunter.  Sure, they have their tranq-shot but what else can they do that another class can't already do better?
---
Hunters should be out in the world, gathering materials. They are definitely the best farmers, by far. 
---
I put my hunter in a farm spot and keep him there. When I need items from that spot, log in and farm - mail to main and log out.
---
I want it! I want it! I want it!
---
I actually kind of wonder now how they will split chat channels.  General is cross-layer as I understand, but it wouldn't make sense for local defense to be..
---
uhhh its pretty much the marketing for anything light cig its very common much like drinks with an ad saying now with less sugar or something says now with less fat! its the same thing dog dont get it twisted
---
sounds like my grandma
---
2.5k server limits, no changes - deal with it.
---
Queue times, busy starting zones - warts and all.
---
This is how I was, except my friends played WoW but my parents wouldn't pay for a sub when I was young. I think that Classic WoW will go through 2 periods of play in the beginning. You'll have the initial launch, with everyone playing it most likely (even the retail tryhards will give it a day or 2) the hype will last for a week or two. It will eventually fall of to those who play Classic for the enjoyment of classic. The second period will be the content creator period which will result from some niche that classic WoW will provide, such as Ironman/hardcore that OSRS provides that people will want to do. Overall I think it will be the most popular version of the game atleast till the next expansion.
---
Did blizzard behave in the same way it behaves in the beta?
---
Honestly couldn’t care less about retail players. Blizzard bends over backwards to cater to those peoples desires - it led to the absolute shithole that is modern WoW.
---
You are kinda squishy at times, everyone is constantly begging you to heal for their group, a lot of down ranking to be done
---
And then I'll reupload a "REACTION!!!" video where I ham it up to someone else's rehashed content. It's like an idiotic Inception kind of thing.
---
It is attainable, if you put in the time. The same way raid gear is listed, even though not everybody got time to raid.
---
Viability is relative. Your points only apply to min-max hardcore raiding. Their DPS is still viable without MCP and runes/pots to any guild that isn't competing for records and/or focused on insane efficiency. I like how critically you min-maxers think, but you use a focus in reality when you forget largely every guild just needs warm bodies that can fill roles.
---
I’m playing a fem Tauren Druid because I love to do one thing: carry the flag in WSG :)
---
Going through your post history, it's pretty much nothing but you calling everyone that doesn't follow the exact cookie cutter BiS minmaxed specifications bad at the game. It's totally fine to point out what the best strategy is, but acting like anyone who doesn't follow those guidelines to the T is worthless doesn't make you look smart, it just makes you look like a douche.
---
I'm an orc because I read Lord of the Clans.
---
So warlocks should have tailoring engineering and herb
---
#You landlubbers are tougher than I thought!
---
I too dislike Dishonorable Kills... /s
---
So you are telling me it isn't worth using a dps increasing ability as a dps? There are plenty of times that it is worth popping this ability as an orc warrior. I always popped it with my Deathwish and with reck.
---
Listening to FORTITUDE PLEAse GrOuP fOuR - but they already have it.
---
lol
---
I mean if you are a true mongoloid you will pop it.
---
I don't think they will add brewfest for the exact reason you said. It wasn't added until bc, the properties connected with the event isn't in the game and doubt they will add them
---
Was this on the OG Malfurion server? I played there with a toon named Kry. He was a good raid leader.
---
This: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hand_of_Reckoning 
---
It only works on enemies that aren't already attacking you (so it was only for pulling enemies off allies whereas taunt could be used preemptively) and it came in handy.
---
&gt; And monks just make zero sense. I'm gonna throw half a dozen kegs of ale at you that I just pulled out of no where as a way to taunt, yeah!
---
Yeah. They should remove hunters too though, just pulling traps out of nowhere and somehow freezing people into ice cubes? Makes no sense.
---
Other people have said it but going to echo it as a druid main, go shaman.
---
Totems make the warrior's life so much better. Windfury is a godsend, as warriors spend most of their time, auto attacking. If you want to do dungeons, shaman pairs really well with warrior, even if you are enhance or anything else, you can heal easily, stoneskin totem, out of combat rez, ank, mana spring totem, etc etc are all very useful.
---
Druid is much better for casters, rogues and hunters.
---
which isnt possible unless you have a farming alt...
---
First time I heard Berserking called 'extra trinket'. Confusing especially in comparison to gnomes, since Escape Artist is just as much a 'trinket-y' racial.
---
Poor pre-mop hunters
---
They can cc better than rogues in dungeons at least
---
Tyr's Hand was also a good place for pickpocket runs. If memory serves, there were very few, if any patrols that could see through stealth. I remember making decent money off of selling all the gems on AH after filling my bags, particularly Azerothian Diamonds and Star Rubies.
---
I mean mages have a quest in the late lvl 30s that give them a Wand and Staff or offhand
---
You’ll be finer questing in teld. Just buy white vendor weps if they are an upgrade. If your worried about it get to level 6 for SotC. I recently went over there at lvl 2 on a pserver launch, didn’t really slow me down at all
---
I sent you a message. Actually I think it’s a chat
---
I forget if it was overhealing or self healing, but one of them doesn't generate any threat. I spent a while trying to figure out if i could self heal to draw threat (since healing applies threat to all enemies in combat) but it didn't ever work.
---
Implying racials are balanced lmao. If anything it could be a way to balance things out.
---
Engineering + X for pvp.
---
You can make decent money from tailoring (gear isn't that great from tailoring to be perfectly honest). If you are worried about money, go enchanting. It's much more of a money maker, being able to AOE grind, and disenchant your own greens, and also people will always be needing enchants on their gear, so it's always generating gold, especially if you have high tiered enchants.
---
Shadow Priests do really good damage.... for about 60 seconds. Then they run out of mana. BC might’ve been a golden age for them, but man vanilla was rough. Aside from pvp of course.
---
War of the Ancients is fucking dope.
---
I was saying "That's just not true" to your statement of " There is never a single raid in all of Vanilla where a Warlock will out perform an equally geared Mage. And no, I'm not talking about Ignite stacking. Even after you equally distribute the Ignite damage across all Mages, this remains true."
---
I can give you some examples of warlocks out dpsing mages in raid. I sadly don't have any damage meters from private servers to show my warlock as [realmplayers.com](https://realmplayers.com) no longer exists. BUT, here we go. 
---
1. Chromaggus: Mages can get fucked on this fight, and warlocks can absolutely out dps mages if there are no frost vulnerabilities and mostly shadow/fire/nature.
---
2. Nefarion: Mages get fucked on this fight unless they get lucky and get no mage calls. Every mage call they run 100 yards from the rest of the raid and sit as sheeps for a while
---
3. Vaelastrasz the Corrupt: Warlocks get less spell pushback at the start of the fight by utilizing voidwalker sacrifice shield along the the fire absorb pots everyone should be using, allowing for better casting. And of course the highest caster dps on this fight will likely be whoever gets "lucky" with the debuff and gets instant casts towards the end of the fight when tank threat can handle it.
---
4. Firemaw: Warlocks can stay in and cast at firemaw longer, and get less spell pushback by, again, using the voidwalker sacrifice shield at the start of the fight. This won't be the case later in the expansion when guilds can kill him super fast.
---
These are just the examples of warlocks outdpsing mages I thought of off the top of my head, there may be more instances.
---
Also reducing the bosses armor by 640 is absolutely an important reason to bring 2 warlocks.
---
I notice you didn't respond to the 4 other examples of why you want more warlocks than 1 in a raid. I look forward to hear from you
---
Blood DKs were fucking fun though full blood DK teams running Outland Dungeons while leveling. But as you said, it was a slippery slope after that
---
Yeah mage race doesn’t matter for pve. People like gnome for the escape artist. The extra intellect is whatever.
---
Always played a class that can heal as a way to get groups quick... I wanna play rogue but think I will miss being able to.also heal dungeons. Also gearing rogue will be harder than priest or sham. Pls help.
---
"Technically the more geared the raid is the easier it is to carry shitty meme specs"
---
They aren't ... Blizz had to pair down the classes to the point they became the same class with different weapons, all can self heal, all can escape, all have cc, all have some kind of gap opener/closer
---
iM kItE TAnKiNg
---
Well if you go prot (you know...... the tanking tree) you actually have ziltch for AoE threat and only 1 instant skill, so you spend the majority of your time literally waiting for weapon swings to generate threat.
---
Warriors at least have cleave (aoe) sunder (instant cast), charge to initiate, etc.
---
Honestly prot paladins are good at 1 thing: Not getting killed. But that doesn't help in most situations, really.
---
You have to press a or m before clicking with the mouse to attack or move. Didn't age well
---
Yes it's not exactly the same situation. Both of them were just placeholders though. Otherwise the old mounts wouldn't have been made unavailable.
---
Was it really that rare? I had them on my rogue in vanilla and I don't remember it being that hard, guess I got lucky.
---
(Episode 3)  
---
That's why he has other episodes on cat dps.
---
Yikes!  This stuff is crazy.  Fascinating how much some of this stuff goes for, and how much stuff they even sell instead of throwing away.   How much does a mocap suit cost new?  I would have thought something like that would be reusable, doesn't look special to the movie (the weapons, maybe--though why would you want that....).
---
OP could only do that because he already had knowledge of on-going events in different layers. 1000 players could've run past that spot but had no idea a massive event was taking place simply because they were sorted into a different layer.
---
Despite the negativity exuded by your comment, I hope you have a wonderful week and a happy life. What works for some may not for others, and that's okay. "Simple as that" is never as simple as that. :) Be happy and healthy, my friend. 
---
If you're looking forward to Classic as well, I wish you amble bag-space and lucky /rolls. In the immortal words of Bill &amp; Ted: "Be excellent to each other!"
---
People would totally do that just to see how efficient it is.  There are people who would grind all the way to 60 which some would find boring but still did it.
---
Because he's nice  to talk to, perhaps he's good aswell so you would like to run dungeons with him? I don't see much of an issue here.
---

About 1 ammo for every 2 seconds, at least. So an hour of combat is 1800 ammo (9 stacks). At level 60, that's 18 Thorium Bars and 18 Dense Stone. Even on a late-age Pserver, Thorium Bars rarely every went below 10s each and Dense Stones the same for 4s each. So we can call the minimum around 2.5g per hour. But on a fresh server, at least double that price should be expected.
---
I am for it for Week 1-2 Max. During this time I also want it to also only allow for switching shards in an Inn (loved this simple and elegant solution I read a few weeks back)
---
Anything after week 2, most people will either have decided they are staying or going and the mad rush will be over.  
---
At that point let server play as is for 2 more weeks, then poll the server and give option for server split or to stay large. 60% majority needed to split.
---
true. god i do want to kill that fat woman in retail. she's so annoying
---
but i don't wanna be a tauren :(
---
Not even close. Traps are used throughout all sorts of cultures. It's not far fetched to have *magic* traps in a fantasy game. Barrels of beer being thrown around? It looks very stupid in the Warcraft setting.
---
There is no heirloom armour in classic.
---
Yes. As a druid main here's why:
---
Easily the least wanted healer in dungeons and raids. Your healing output is flat out worse than all other healing classes/specs. You can't stack the same HoTs on the same guy.
---
Your only ress got a long ass cooldown, there's legit huge amounts of people not taking druids because of this, for dungeons.
---
In world PvP. All 3 specs literally play the same. 
---
Playing Feral? You do a little more damage in Cat/Bear form, but you still play the outsustain/DoT playstyle, rotating stuns/roots and heals.
---
Playing Balance? Your DoTs do a little more damage, but you still tank people in Bear form most of the time, rotating stuns/roots and heals.
---
Playing Resto? Probably your best PvP spec, plays like the two others, your heals/DoTs just do more healing/damage. Still rotating stuns/roots and heals.
---
Feral DPS have become way more respected over the years, because of theorycrafting and figuring out some niche items are incredibly good. However, the amount of effort and skill needed, is way higher than other classes. So, in the end you're only doing just about the same DPS as the top melee, on a patchwerk fight, but you're using items with limited uses, which needs to be farmed and the risk of fucking up is there, and then your DPS will drop significantly.
---
Crys
---
They would probably never do something like this. It’d be too easy for your average player.
---
&gt;we had everything up to Nef on farm
---
What does a druid tanking in BWL have to do with the OPs post?  He's talking about Naxx...not POS BWL which is a joke...
---
Both you and the target must be ooc to sap.
---
Wrong by the way - if it takes someone 500 hours to hit 60 - that's because they choose to.
---
200 is average.
---
Doubt. Where in Vanilla was a Hunter farming ~80 GPH?
---
I agree with you, i just don't get what that has to do with racials? Personally i would rather not have a "priest racial" for every class combination it would just clutter up the pvp and the min maxing is already out of control as it is lol.
---
&gt;athermoon stronghold in feralis to get some quests. On the way I seen a 2 or 3 level higher level female orc hunter. We ran past each other and I noticed her stop and had tha
---
undead s priest!
---
Blind is a poison effect
---
200 is average according to who? Show me the data.
---
Yeah resisted traps suck but yeah sap will pop you out of stealth and get you murdered as pve specs and if you have imp sap you have to go into the subtlety tree and you won't do good dps, and you are right sap can't be applied to in combat mobs
---
I mean i will be DWing against bosses lol. Once i have enough gear, DW/Defiance is bis.
---
Problem is that Blizz is likely to have somewhere between one and two dozen servers at launch *at most*, meaning that without layering you may wind up having queues that last for a few hours, which would be a pretty disastrous launch. Layering lets them start out smaller and check data before deciding to add new servers (which I really hope they actually take the time to do. If it’s still really busy at the end of Phase 1 then all Layering accomplished was to kick the “extremely long queues” can down the road.)
---
Orc!
---
Actually clearing content is the fun part though..
---
Awesome ideas! I was just having fun with the whole thing, glad you joined in. I like the idea of giving humans a special that is "good" and less tailored to the evilness of the class. Cool stuff, thanks for the addition.
---
You mean enjoying the game ? A bit over 8 days /played is considered “very wrong” now? I laugh.
---
This does not solve any issues. People will want to play with their friends from the beginning. They easy answer is live with layering as it is the most comprehensive solution to a huge issue.
---
Sent you PM man! hope to hear from ya!

---
\_\_\*\*\*Introduction\*\*\*\_\_: Blackrock candy Co. is a mostly casual, semi hard-core raiding guild focused on clearing raid content as efficiently as possible while maintaining a fun raiding atmosphere.   We aspire to build an extraordinary, camaraderie based community that mutually respects our members not just as gamers, but as people.  We want the player, not the class. However, if you want world firsts or to be the top everything, everywhere, at all times, this is probably not the guild for you.  This is more like a Health Department B+ rated restaurant.  You know they don't clean their bathrooms enough, but the graffiti in the stalls is hilarious, and the food is worth the risk.
---
\_\_\*\*\*Expectations\*\*\*\_\_: Come prepared.  Show up early to a raid night with consumables.  Know your rotation, curses, buffs etc.  We are looking for eager, active, skilled, friendly players that possess a sense of humor, the ability to not be offended easily, and want to help us grow into a fun, camaraderie based, B+ rated restaurant. New and veteran players alike are welcome to apply.

Fuck all alliance races except dwarves. Dwarves are cool.

Fuck undead, make your own faction, you're not welcome into the horde!

Doesn't run on Linux.
---
&gt;EDIT: realize DW wasn't available till TBC, got some bad info.
---
I don't think anyone has mentioned it here yet but shamans are also horde only in vanilla. Just an FYI in case that alters your decision.
---
you clearly missed the joke
---
True, but I was referencing the Tortolla calligraphy world quests &gt;.&lt;
---
In the closed beta there were hardly any warrior tanks for 5 mans until all the shaman and hunters got frustrated that they could not get into any groups because there were not enough tanks, and so they roll warrior alts.
---
Then there was a surge of terrible tanks. Ex shaman and huntards that only chose to play warrior so they could get into dungeons easily. They didn't know how to tank, they didn't even want to tank, and it showed.
---
What's 10 x 24?
---
If you think 10 days from 1 - 60 is slow for the average player... enjoy rushing a 15 year old game!
---
How do you obtain heirlooms in classic? Thought you already had to have a lvl 60 in order to get em?
---
Idk I’m really enjoying this deer with benediction
---
For real, one of the most mind blowing selling points of the game in 2004-5 was that you could run from Booty Bay to EPL without ever hitting a loading screen.  It was INSANE then and it would literally be a selling point now to not ever have any sort of sharding/layering/etc ruin that.
---
that was on a good day mind you :P there's a vid on our guild website of one of our other druids deliberately taunting flamegor at teh end of the fight and getting half the healers killed haha.  we dont take ourselves too seriously
---
Play a mage

I think this would be my ideal duo I’m just worried about gear being a problem

I thought the 3rd was when he "fainted".  Oh well, love the meme.
---
&gt;Reason I'm asking is because if its something like 5 PM PST then I can save one vacation day.
---
It launches 3pm PST on 8/26
---
No I am saying go back to servers which you have no guarantee of quality, accuracy or longevity. And that was your threat. If someone wants to go play on a private server, there is nothing that is going to stop them as long as they understand that every private server is someones representation of what Vanilla wow is and is not completely accurate.
---
I was debating a /s for the end of that message but figured I’d go without. So I guess that was the wrong move. My kid is young enough (5 is still years away) that he doesn’t really play alone, but he’s on his way.
---
it is when you're the OT
---
I haven't played WoW in a while, so my advice might be pretty dated, but I remember being a semi-decent enh Shaman in vanilla. I also can't offer a lot of advice in regards to min/maxing stats, but as far as play style goes:
---
Remember Shaman is a utility/support class.  First priority is to make sure the proper totems are down and enemies are purged.  Also remember you have healing spells.  Backing out and healing the team might be the most beneficial thing you can do in many situations.  Don't ever be the first one into the skirmish.
---
  Secondly, pick your targets wisely.  This means avoiding 1v1's with classes that can easily kite you.  Keep your eye out for poorly geared clothies that aren't paying attention to you.  Once the target has been identified, I usually like to say a quick prayer to the windfury gods before charging in and watching them melt under the force of my hammer...or watching them not melt in which case there is nothing wrong with Ghost Wolfing out when necessary.
---
I also can't offer a lot of advice as far as specs go, and I'm excited to try some things out in classic, but I do remember NS being too versatile to really pick anything else.
---
All that being said, if you are really serious about PVE or PVP (premades) you won't have much choice but to be resto or ele respectively.  Ele just offers everything enhance does and then some.  Enhance does, however, offer a playing experience that no other class/spec in the game replicates, and it can be really fun.
---
&gt;The thing that makes vanilla great is that very fact that not everyone is equal in all tasks. Each class and race complement the others in their shortcomings.
---
This so much. Giving shamans/paladins to both sides was the start of it. Now it seems like every class has the same buffs/debuffs as each other. I know blizzard wanted to push the whole "bring the player not the class" idea but it really destroyed the point in selecting a class.
---
&gt; February 2005
---
You were already several months past release rush. 
---
But even at that, I was there on release day and it wasn't as crazy.
---
All that being said, I think release day they didn't have many players.  They didn't hit a million subscribers until a decent time after release.
---
People are on this "make it like it was on release" but they can't really cut down players queued up, as I feel classic might have a larger "release" than vanilla did back in the day.  So you're going to get screwed with more queues than you would back then.
---
That's not data showing me the average time it takes to get to 60.
---
Simple request my friend.
---
Fairly certain I will pickup skinning and either herbalism or mining for the first toon.  My preferred choice would be herbalism AND mining but minimap problems (it'd be great if there was an addon that tracked both or flipped between both every second).  
---
Gold is so hard to come by early on in the game I feel I'll put off crafting professions until later.

Shield lowers their rage gain, maybe they'll then stop using blood fury
---
No deterrence in vanilla.
---
So doing it less than 200 hours is not enjoying the game?
---
Damn I've been doing it wrong for years.
---
They do it for DM, SM and Mara too hf
---
I don't understand why you believe that crowded initial zones is an issue that will impact *only* retail players, though.
---
I agree: Retail WoW bad. I no longer play retail WoW. The subscriber numbers show that the majority of the former WoW subscribers felt similarly.
---
If someone logs into Durotar and has trouble tagging mobs and doing the first quest they get, because there are 500 people, they're not going to log off *only because they're a retail WoW player*. 
---
That's legitimately unplayable, it doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't compromise the integrity of the game to just admit that there's no easy way to adapt the zones to accommodate 3,000 concurrent Level 1-10s per server.
---
This ability didn't exist in Vanilla. The first 'taunt' ability Paladins got was in TBC and it was pretty poor without a macro. Hand of Reckoning is a wrath ability.
---
Man, are you okay? You seem mad.
---
Man, I'm more of a pvp guy, and daggers is just straight up more fun in pvp. Y'all can have your excruciating dal rends grind and I'll go grab my daggers and hop into some BGs.
---
&gt;I am personally hoping non meta only guilds pop up.
---
This is my only issue with classic. All of the "firsts" will be accomplished by people/guilds that have micromanaged everything down to the smallest detail. It won't be done by people that truly had to figure it out. 
---
It'll still be an accomplishment but it has a lot less value to it.
---
Americans can play it on the evening of 26th. Europeans get shit on, it gets released around midnight here.
---
It destabilizes the economy as resources increase with the rate of the respawns.
---
It discourages the incentive to group.
---
Creates dramatic swings in difficulty (sometimes there are 100 people and you play a game of who can tag fastest, other times you're solo and mobs repeatedly spawn on top of you so fast they kill you)
---
Encourages stale gameplay (standing still and killing the same spawn over and over)
---
All the above leads to far greater changes to the gameplay experience for far more people than layering. On top of that, it would be easier to leave enabled and not have the pressure to be removed that layering does.
---
You can always go for the cheaper [Ice Threaded Arrows](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19316) from AV. That 1 dps less doesnt even matter. And it looks way cooler due to the frost animation.
---
That was my initial plan, but just watched a video that said all the extra gray drops and low bag space made skinning not worth it while leveling. Idk now
---
good one LULW
---
Yeah, those exist and are VERY USEFUL!
---
The short answer to the OP is yes, it is a dps loss to not go Human. It's simple math. The only question you have to ask yourself is if you're bothered by not having the theoretical maximum. 
---
If you plan to play for the long haul and have aspirations of completing Naxx I'm willing to wager there will be a point at which you will wish you were Human if you don't roll one. 
---
But maybe you just really like being a Gnome and that's more fun to you than shifting the odds in your favor slightly. And that's ok. A Gnome Warrior who likes their character and pushes themselves to gear appropriately, farm consumables, show up on-time reliably and helps others will be more valuable than a Human Warrior who shows up late with no consumables and has to borrow gold for repairs. There are a lot of things to consider but purely by the numbers Human wins. 
---
Gearing will also be easier especially early on as a Human.
---
If you're the type of person who reads threads like these and cares about numbers it seems like Human is the play.

There was a survey posted here that showed a third of people who plan on playing classic never played vanilla, and on a separate question 30% of people will be playing a class they're unfamiliar with. Assume people know their jobs at your own peril.
---
There is also a way to avoid the infamous Wetlands run by swimming from Menethil Harbor. You drown yourself above Dun Morough and rez at Dwarf/gnome starting zone.  Look up the exact coordinates, but it’s the second indent into Dun Morough. The run is fun to do once, but the swim technique is much much quicker.  Also can confirm Druid trainer in the SW park district.

Cheers!

Those are all progressively dope weapons for a sword rogue. But Dal Rends is pre-raid BiS for sword rogues and IIRC not only has a low drop rate, but is very popular across a range of classes/specs, so very hard to actually get your hands on.

---
&gt; You blew it up too hard, yet not hard enough.
---
Anyone remember Everquest, where wizards didn't even dare to start dps until a mob was 50%?
---
I type it *very* ironically from time to time.  The thing is, I actually do want Classic to be as close to vanilla as possible.  The way to get that is with things like leeway and layering though.. 
---
That's not to say that they are perfect solutions by any means, but it would be completely ignorant to say that it's even possible to recreate vanilla.  Even if we ran it on 15 year old hardware, the people themselves have changed and you can't undo that.
---
Making up for a bad tank or bad DPS is the worst. Like DPS can't kill a boss fast enough so you have to stress extra hard to keep them all up longer than they are supposed to. 
---
Or a DPS pulling aggro and you have to waste Mana keeping them alive or wipe.
---
Lol bud, show the data disproving my experience playing vanilla with hundreds of people taking between 8-13 days /played.
---
It's okay that you are a catakid and are gonna burn yourself out of classic by November - no need to try and bully someone over an opinion big guy.

It is true, there are also lessons learned from the original launch and subsequent launches that they should use and make better.
---
I don't remember the timer at all. What was it?
---
haha, yea good point. we can try to discourage the behavior with some subtle Pavlovian conditioning.
---
Played a Gnome Rogue during vanilla up until cata, then I left the game and wont be back till classic. 
---
Because of how much of an altaholic I am I plan on making at least 5 characters. Gonna try maining a warrior tank for when I'm playing with friends, my off main will be a split between rogue and mage, then I'll have a priest as my filler and a paladin as a hobby.
---
That's my plan so far any way. I expect that I will have 1 of every class come launch day. Not a problem though I plan on taking my time and thoroughly enjoying the classic experience.
---
I am sure you can. Its just not common. And an hour and a half and you did EVERY boss? I think there are over 20. Granted some are random spawn chance/ring of law stuff.
---
Keep ya on your toes!!
---
Not sure, but I picked up the gnome area imp quest as a human, as well as the human one.
---
The book respawns fairly quickly, it's less than a minute as I remember,
---
You sound like a filthy fucking casual
---
Shame it doesn't work in Classic.
---
I think TBC priest racials were balanced (fear ward was given to all priest and that racial was changed to chastise, a root with some holy damage if I remember correctly)
---
Can’t use potions while shape shifted, because no opposable thumbs. Actually i wonder if druids can still noggenfogger in forms, that was super annoying
---
Fuck rogues
---
&gt;This is some pretty cleverly disguised fearmongering, I'll give you that..
---
You mean like "omg, without layers there will be 5 hour queues, overcrowding, server merges, and it will all be horrible!!!!"
---
1.  I think you'd be surprised.
---
2.  True
---
3.  True
---
4.  I don't find this reliable.
---
5.  I would bet $ if you did some sort of double blind study you'd fine that overall, merges are better than layering long term.  The closest comparison we have is pre-sharding and post-sharding.
---
6.  I think he means Classic will compete with Retail and it will cost $ to run them both effectively, so they will chose retail.
---
What I don't get, though. Is how a person can train all their lives and be this hot-shot champion and do all this cool stuff and then get their asses handed to them by a rat because it has that "Elite" status. How in the hell did a rat get that strong? Why does it take so many career champions to kill one dude in rags? Never has made any sense to me.
---
Which I belive cuts down on the longevity for players like me - who are excited to revisit vanilla but am no way interested in raiding for months on end - maybe it will grab me since I have no plans on ever going back to modern wow, but time will tell :)
---
Don't forget shadow oil, shadow elixir, spell power elixir and supreme power flask for max memes.
---
It's an observation bias. At this point most pserver people announcing themselves are the "as a mother" type, or someone basically quoting some youtube videos.
---
Although These are More Like pserver Class discords right?
---
who said anything about ubrs gear
---
oh yea im sure theyll fix all the pet ai bugs they still have on bfa until today
---
you have a point but there's people for whom 50,000 dollar isn't a big deal. I went to school with some chinese students (from the mainland) and their parents were buying them like BMWs here cash money in hand because they are way cheaper then they are in china, so they would drive this brand new car for a couple yrs cause it was nothing to them compared to how much it was back home. I think money goes further for them in the west in a certain sense.
---
They don’t exist in Classic
---
You are the one saying it is wrong. I didnt claim going fast isnt enjoying the game. Some people will level fast, others slow.
---
Nice, was going to focus on my mage at the start and just power through but I think I'll just dualbox mage/lock from the get go!
---
Hojk'Mel'ahr*
---
They do at least in Mythic +, the actual non tutorial mode of the game
---
Sure but then you cant check while out in the world.
---
I think it will, but being part of that D3 error myself it was really a great example of the worst case scenario lol.
---
Why are Priests and Hunters the only ones with Epic Class Quests?
---
the "grunt from your sword" part that was specifically talked about was spot on
---
Now if only I could decide my professions, Tailor/Skin Herb/Alch  Tailor/Herb or Tailor/Enchanting for the early wands then drop enchanting for Herb or skin for my Mage.... ahhhh I can’t decide
---
Back in the day I made so much money pickpocketing and massacring scarlet elites in Tyr’s Hand. With my ill-gotten scarlet cash I was able to artificially inflate the price of arcanite bars by buying up the entire auction house supply and reselling at ludicrous prices. Ahhh, memories.
---
Yeah you’re wrong. Very active server that is blizzlike. Nice assumption though. I plan on going to classic but I can safely recommend this p server and feel safe that it’ll last.
---
But to them it's but stupid amounts. 50,000 to some people is like ten bucks to the average person. And that's being generous, for someone like bill Gates or bezos that amount is roughly equivalent to 25 cents

&lt;Death Dealers&gt; on Shattered Hand.  I actually played the beta a little on my older brother's account, but my account was day 1. Played DaoC before then with many people who also ended up in DD
---
Friend list doesn't work like that..  You can add anybody, it never notifies or requests anything from them.
---
I hear ya. Be vocal at the beginning of runs, let the DPS and tank know if they pull while you’re still drinking/less than 50% mana/ whatever your preference, they are responsible for killing those mobs without your help. That’s a little harsh, but you get the point.
---
HEY ROGUE, PLEASE STOP TRYING TO BE A TANK!
---
You can take a copy of the letter into your bag.
---
How would you determine the number of players? Currently online, so I just have to make NA chars at EU time and vice versa? Characters created so bank alts and quitters will factor in?

Have you checked /r/nightelfmohawks?

I have died so much on speedrun from trying to weave between 2 mobs to avoid pulling 1 and then I end up pulling both , get dazed and panic into another 2 mobs. Always just pull 1 by 1 is the best tip for speed leveling. Killing is more exp than a corpse run.
---
Yup. All of them. Full clear.
---
Play what you want, as long as it’s viable for what you want to do with that char come level 60.  
---
Ally priest that’s not a dwarf?  That’s fine.  You won’t have Fear Ward, but you’ll get to be the race that you want. 
---
Even though I’m excited or Classic as a little kid on their birthday, I’m not going to go nuts over min-maxxing.  I’m going to enjoy the game.

Best run was by Joana at basically 5 days.  That's 124 hours.  Most, or average, will not level in 5 days played.  Most will take a little longer.  Stating 200 hours to max level is not some arbitrary number.  Since I'm unsure if there is a peer reviewed journal to cite let's go by the vanilla speed leveling professional Joana himself:
---
"The time it takes for the average player to level from 1 to 60 was around 30 days of playing time. My fastest time was 4 days 20 hours and 49 minutes with a troll hunter"
---
30 days played would put you at 720 hours which is way less generous than the 200 mentioned above.
---
Why are you fighting someone so hard on what is basic accepted knowledge?
---
So if the cap is 50 players for a new layer, the 51st gets the honor of his own world of warcraft? Sounds pretty lonesome.
---
They might be taking the max level of each mob type from a database. Not sure who made the maps, doesn't give credit on imgur.
---
its an unnecessary expense and a luxury but you are underestimating how much money the people have who buy this are. its not like some dude who won 400k in powerball its probably people with net worths in the 10s of millions personally and 100s of millions for their family.
---
Playing a hunter in classic was an interesting experience...Doing basic stuff like freeze trapping adds or pulling a mob off a healer with my pet blew peoples minds since the average hunter apparently never did stuff like that.
---
Overhealing is completely irrelevant if you don’t oom yourself doing it
---
That’s for the other guy. I’m well aware, I saw the announcement live.
---
Engineering for pve isn’t expected even for min maxers
---
lol shit I completely whooshed.
---
I saw some videos where a player discussed gambling near the org bank in a similar fashion. I always thought it would be fun, but the problem I believe is that it's against the games ToS so you can get penalized for it.
---
Still though, I'm a gambling man to my bones.
---
This.  I did the whole thing In about an hour on the previous stress test.
---
I imagine layering as shards.... So same difference. :)
---
I don't know but at this point I have to ask you: *Are you daft*?
---
* You end up missing an additional 2% of your hits *no matter what you do*. That is already 2.2% damage if you are at 0% hit.
---
* If you have any hit on gear, you lose another 1% hit. So if any of your pieces has chance to hit, you instead miss an additional 3% of your hits. That is already 3.1% - 3.3% more damage **just through +5 weapon skill**.
---
* Your white hits deal 9.3% more damage. Your white hits easily account to 10-40% of your overall damage. We are already above 4% more damage overall with this, perhaps at 6-7% more damage.
---
* Your enemy dodge decreases from 6.5% to 6.0%. That is almost another 0.5% more damage.
---
All things added up we are looking at around 5% to 7.5% more damage.
---
All that does not consider *that you don't get any rage for misses or worse waste your rage of yellow abilities*. This one is *huge*. This right here can in a worst case scenario be a huge dps loss of a similar order of magnitude as the one above.
---
If you are disabled or something, I genuinely apologize for my tone. Until then, please crawl back under the bridge you came from, I think you lost a Whiskey bottle there.
---
&gt;You're ignoring the fact that you simply cannot recreate vanilla 100%.
---
I mean you literally can.  Theoretically they could release the exact same game.  The experience might be different, but the game would be the same.
---
Regardless, layering makes it less close to the vanilla experience.
---
&gt;No sane or reasonable person thinks login queues are "warts"
---
Uhhhh... What?  The whole point of that saying is we know that there will be problems when trying to stay true to vanilla, a hectic release and server merges included. And, like in vanilla, we expect them to try to mitigate that *without changing the game*.  That might mean more servers or server clusters.  But not layering.
---
It's because leeway doesn't affect the cost much, whereas layering not only affects the playing experience but also the operating costs of the project.
---
Also you are AFFECTED by an EFFECT. An effect might be effective, but it might not affect you.

---
Ever consider a warlock, it seems to fit your bill.  Strong(est?) solo class, needed for raids, less popular class so you'll find a raid spot.  Great overlapping specs for Raiding and PvE.  I played one in classic and spec'd SM/Ruin with Imp bloodpact (extra tank group health, guaranteed spot).  I'm rolling priest since I've been healing since WotLK, but would definitely roll warlock again if I was going for DPS
---
getting butthurt over pvp on a pvp server, hilarious :D
---
None of these guides take into account that a fresh server means there is no wrong choice. Gold is everything. All professions will be money makers done right. Get your epic mount and then enough funds for a 1-300 engineering power level.

i didnt say we did bwl that night.  he was also our 2nd MT
---
That settles it. I'm going to main a mage, warlock, priest, hunter and warrior.
---
Well, you are imagining wrong.
---
Sharding and layering are two different things.
---
I have never had shit internet and melee leeway was only noticeable when there was nobody on the server. Wee hours in the morning and such. If the server is going to have the same built in latency, then fine. But if the server has been improved and it does not, then the entire experience will shift dramatically. Melee will rule the world without any competition.
---
Well I'm my own source, most folks don't think I'm a cool dude an I'm me so I'd know
---
I get off work for 2 weeks vacation at 3pm... gonna disappear around noon from work for an off site project...
---
You've sacrificed for the cause, and I salute you!
---
Is it? I’ve seen it once. And its not what you get in mc... im talking about what you go into mc with. Most people use swords until they get daggers in mc. Also, you won’t be the only rogue so if it dies drop there’s no guarantee you will get it.
---
Hmm I thought it did, but it's been 14 years maybe I just misremember whether dots proc blackout.  I'd argue two extra ticks on SWP is still strong though, because it's a spell with 100% SP coefficient so those two extra ticks bring the spell to 133% spellpower coefficient for the same mana/cast.  Great value.
---
As for mana savings, that's a separate thing from blackout.  It was more about getting to mental strength for the 10% mana, but your instants are huge in pvp so don't discount that (shield, swp, **dispell**).  In PVP mana is going to be a bigger issue with mana drains and viper sting from the other side, plus the need to cast dispel (which doesn't scale with +healing talents).  Especially if you play horde, you have no paladin to help with dispels.  So whether you go for spiritual or mental will depend wholly on whether you'll pvp more or pve more.
---
DK's always felt a bit gimmicky. Energy or Rage are inherently different from Mana, but DK's had this convoluted resource system and started at level 55, just to set them apart. And as far as I remember (I quit mid-WOTLK), most their arsenal were medium-long cooldowns or buffs, which is a pretty lazy way to design class spells. 
---
I'd rather they had integrated variants of DK abilities into Warriors/Paladins, and added a second class that used ranged weapons instead.
---
When rumors first spread about a new class, I was certain it would be a lightweight "Ranger"-type class, something like a Hunter (except with leather armor, light melee and no pets) - but instead they added *three* new melee classes and Hunters are still (?) the only ranged archetype, which seems a bit odd.
---
Shhh stop telling people
---
It certainly it’s amazing that I’ve had five years out of my 4690k. I am looking into over clocking it. But yes DDR3 Is getting a bit old and slow and hyper x fury whilst fast for its time isn’t quick by any standard now. I don’t plan to play anything but classic for a long time. Maybe elder scrolls VI will tempt an upgrade.
---
Alchemy Tailoring if my shit-poor memory isn't failing me. 
---
Anything with a 24hr CD transmute. I think BS has one as well but I never leveled it so don't really recall.
---
This is giving me flashbacks to the ‘casino’ days of level 1 naked female night elves standing on the IF bridge taking suckers for tons of gold with their shitty odds...
---
“Sluttybitch’s casino is now open!  Just open trade window with your wager and /random 1-1000 when I say ‘roll’!  Roll 655 or higher and you DOUBLE your money!!”
---
Not sure how idiots didn’t realize how terrible those odds are...
---
Wearing a dress.
---
We found the Mage that refuses to decurse!
---
Oh yeah I get vocal.
---
I thought for sure spiritual guidance, spiritual healing, and improved healing would be needed for phase 1 and maybe phase 2.  That seems like a lot of bonus healing and mana cost reduction to lose when wearing mostly blue gear.  I've never played priest at 60 so maybe I'm overestimating how much those help
---
A rogue actually.
---
Does it matter what it is called? It is NOT a vanilla mechanic you semantical dipstick. Point remains. :)
---
You could call it poopshoot instancing that all flushes together when the poop gets too low....idgaf lol
---
Ok that's good! Was afraid it was gonna be to big of a burden
---
completely opposite experience for me on a pserver, the server is on the smaller side though maybe that has an effect
---
Certain items won't be obtainable until later phases.
---
Don't know the list of all things but we'll see at launch.
---
people don’t die in retail? cmon man. shit like this is why the classic community looks bad.

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 8-9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
A hunter play list... I will need to check this out later. Thanks!
---
Never been to an actual casino? Idiots as far as the eye can see.
---
Good news. The end point won't shift soo you can level casually.
---
Neckbeards for life. Piss in a bottle till 60 tho..
---
I'm guessing they will upgrade servers to bc and then startup some fresh vanilla servers for people to restart if they want classic only
---
Nope, it's way more in Classic.
---
That last one is how I will feel if I ever get both as a hunter... I imagine that is not ever going to happen and I will settle for pre-raid bis #2 or so.
---
50 dkp MINUS!
---
You don’t put punctuation inside the quotes for scare quotes.
---
What do you mean who told them? Nobody told them. They did it because they love the game and hey expect it to be playable on Aug 27.
---
Why not? Most(90%) of the Fortnite community is garbage, and they have no problem with 1 win every 200 games. I'm sure they are accustomed to the suffering hour after hour until gratification kicks in.
---
One word which will trigger all feral druids:
---
Gnomeregan
---
Oh so there are commata missing. You kick him, with a grunt, off your sword.
---
I see now. That's why punctuation is important
---
What did you use to create the maps? And do you have a tutorial?
---
I love them, very well presented too.
---
What do you think we are, a bunch of geeks?!
---
My memory betrayed me. The Night Elf Mohawk was in Wrath, not Vanilla :(
---
That was added in Wrath

only super casuals don't expect engineering.  min maxers definitely have to, imagine raiding without half your skills, because that's literally what not having engineering is.
---
If memory serves, a friend of mine in classic did this on his rogue (go figure) and was contacted by a GM with some sort of warning against gambling.
---
Sure. But I will say it again. If you are bad enough with your money to spend it on silly shit like that, then you're probably buying expensive stupid shit too.

Vanilla is a 15 year old easy game and we feel that if you want to play a meme spec then you should be able to. We expect our raiders to show up consumed/enchanted/geared and push their buttons in the right order but won't be enforcing or kicking people out of the guild for making mistakes or missing a raid because real life.

Sweet thx for all the info!  Looking like PI spec with blackout is what I'll try once I get there.  It should fly under the min/max raidar pretty easily and probably work better in pvp too with PI :D
---
you just want t ruin classic with huge launch queues, server instability and then subsequent dead servers after people left from not being able to play the game. You realize inorder or classic to succeed you need to have a player base. And if you can keep another 15% of that player base from removing queues and poor server/client performance it is probably a good thing.  
---
No it is not forced grouping because you can choose to find a group if you like or you did like you did in vanilla and wonder that road for 45 minutes until you realize it spawns in the same spot and you should camp there because thottbot told you too. Secondly how is join a group immersion breaking, this term is thrown around with no true meaning, it is the battle CRYING, not cry, of the #nochanges....but muh immersions.......LOL. And lastly joining a group is not layering abuse........it is joining a group. but hey muh immersions.
---
Aq20 wont be in the game for and the wolfsheaf helm is even easier to get? Not sure why you're even asking this
---
I had a guild leader scream at me once for failing to heal, and I pointed out that her strategy had the tank moving in and out of my line of sight constantly.
---
She said I should move into line of sight.  She really didn't understand that was exactly what I was doing.  I would move into line of sight, and start casting, and the tank would move out of line of sight and break my cast.  Rinse and repeat.
---
She couldn't comprehend that.  I will never know how she got to be a guild leader, or why some people remained loyal to her.
---
I noped out of there as quick as I could.
---
Isn’t that how it was back in Vanilla?
---
When ZG comes out, that will also be another grind to exalted for sure.
---
&gt;is none of the cross-server realms and different \[server\] sharding options that we have available
---
Jesus christ I knew they were prone to "reinterpreting" their old statements to allow for shit but to straight up implement something they've outright said we would have **none** of is pretty shitty. It's not like they had no idea the launch would be a mess when he said that.
---
That's fine. My point is that, of you are spending money are stupid shit that inexpensive, you are probably spending it on stupid expensive shit too.
---
Just listen to Warren Buffet about the value of a single cent. He doesn't throw them away. He stops and picks them up.
---
It’s instant on the stress test/beta
---
that is like half of normal
---
Not all the way but for a while it is
---
I am no coder, but would it be possible to make slight adjustments to leeway BASED on players ping? Everyone continues to reference their own experience and their own pings. Could they not just tie the allotted leeway distance based around your ping?  
---
I can see the massive potential game BREAKING issues, but at the same time, if the ping is limited on the server end, then we will likely not really feel this. If not, Warriors, Shamans, Rogues and Retadins could be cancer. The only response for those was to kite, which makes sense... but 5+ yards is a long way to kite. Especially against classes with mobility abilities.  
---
So Again I ask, could this somehow just be correlated with your ping?
---
oh right! almost forgot
---
Yea, like I said, I'll either change it or 'll make customizable.
---
I played Mount and Blade too. The intro is awesomely immersive indeed.
---
Hell of an addictive game too! Had to give up it when I found myself unable to sleep haha
---
How was Winterspring Frostsaber rep in patch 1.12? That's how it'll be in Classic.
---
&gt;What I do expect to be exciting is what challenges guilds will invent for themselves. First guild to 20 man MC? Could be fun to watch.
---
Oh yea, things like that would be awesome. I had a really good friend and during TBC his guild was one of the first on his realm that could 5 man kara. Probably not that big of a deal but seeing guilds do that sort of thing in vanilla will be fun.
---
&gt; The idea that latency has improved vastly is ridiculous
---
This is just so ass wrong.  Latency has vastly improved thanks to cloud infrastructure services like AWS.  Their are distributed datacenters all over the world now.
---
That means in 2004 I was getting 100ms because I was hitting a server in California from NY.  Now I just hit my local datacenter and get 30ms.
---
Photoshop. I will look into making a tutorial for it.
---
Yeah..  if you have 1-2h to play per day. Then getting to 60 and all of the dungeon set 1 items is a huge challenge and I suspect will take at least 1 year to complete. ( just my feeling ) and we hopefully wont be to far away from the 0.5 questline at that point... if not getting the epic mount and starting to farm for the questline is probably another 6 month mission.
---
These look sick, bummed out I wont actually get to run them.

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before reset, thus the name. :) I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not casual either.

At least it gets all the layering talk jammed into one thread so every 3rd post isn't a layering complaint.
---
I dunno but I remember it was kinda fun to tinker with ammo. Always checking I had enough of it. 
---
It must also be noted that I was glad when they removed it, but in hindsight I miss the tinkering and will welcome it with open arms again. 
---
I will play a hunter and an arms warrior. Uncertain what I will play most. I mained arms warrior all the way to wrath and after that it has been 100% hunter.
---
He knows its suboptimal, that wasnt his question
---
&gt;It's annoying that when someone tried to do this in retail a year or 2 ago that Blizz shut it down
---
I feel you :( I think this pseudolegal reason makes zero common sense. It's genuinely sad.
---
Very true! And every other layering post was a “new alternative idea to layering” that had been posted 37,000 times already.
---
It's a different feeling. Running into someone randomly is different than adding them to group and meeting up. Besides you can't add the opposite faction as a friend. The opposite faction are half the people I'm talking about.
---
Get lost.
---
The finite details of a point are null and void. The overall point is what matters. Nitpick harder you troll.
---
Rested won't cut the time in half. Quest exp doesn't benefit from rest and he won't be traveling any faster.
---
Very adept cutting of his comment seeing as the words following your quote is answering your entire comment. Phasing is for months, launch madness would be a week at most. Ruining the game for weeks beats ruining it for months.
---
Maybe in a few years when naxx is down and everyone got their nostagia fix, we will see new content for classic.
---
I won't have the feeling that if I don't play for one day I lost something
---
During Legion we gambled while we had a 5 minutes break at raids.
---
They had an addon for that, I don't remember what it is called.
---
But basically it reads the input from the chat.   
---
Type "1" to play.
---
And then everyone needs to /roll.
---
The addon will tell who owns money and it keeps track about who lost the most and earned the most.
---
Hello Pingan! Amazing work thank you very much for this!! Just some quick question regarding the ret spec ;)
---
1) the list is currently using 6% hit, but as human and with precision talent, you only need 3%. Could you think it would be possible to reflect that? It tremendously change the itemization !
---
2) could you please tell why you are using Terazan links in P3? Onslaught girdle seems way better to me (strength is far superior that AP for ret).
---
3) Could you please tell why malstorm and wyrmtalak are considered bis from P5? For me it seems that it could have way better items (simply HoJ over wyrmtalak? Or trinkets from AQ or Naxx?)
---
Many thanks in advance for you answer, and once again, insane job!
---
What is the Winterveil present going to be in the third year?
---
An MMO where I can actually interact with people.
---
Hey, that guy is cool.  Imma give him some gold for going out of his way to help me!  CANNOT TRADE WITH PLAYERS NOT ON YOUR SERVER!
---
Hey, that guy is cool.  Imma send him an invite to my guild.  CANNOT ADD GUILDMEMBERS THAT ARE NOT ON YOUR SERVER!
---
Hey, that guy needs my help.  *runs over there just to see him, the mobs, and the mining node, disappear into nothingness*
---
lol finally someone here who understands...they act like blizzard needs to blow 20k per server but layering is free. Layers are just virtual servers in the same way their current servers are...I'm unaware of blizzards infrastructure but I imagine they use virtual machines and each 'server' is actually multiple virtual machines pointing at a global and server based database.

# Classic WoW Realm Community:
---
We along with many other guilds, we are in process of creating a realm wide community to benefit all players, all guilds, and all factions of the server. A meeting will be held in late July prior to WoW Classic launch to determine various specifics of the community. We are currently reaching out to guilds at this time to grow and strengthen the realms community prior to launch. **The only requirement is choosing to be on the same realm.**
---
**The server community is being created to help with the following:**
---
* Finding Crafters of Rare Items and Recipes
---
* Dungeon forming
---
* Raid forming
---
* Recruitment
---
* World Bosses
---
* Scarab Lord Farming
---
* Role play events
---
* Leveling events
---
* Dungeon events
---
* Speed Run Tournaments and PvE events (raids, dungeons, leveling)
---
* Dueling Tournaments and PvP Events (1v1, battle royale, wpvp, premade BG’s)
---
* Guild vs Guild PvE and PvP challenges
---
* Organizing Large scale WPvP (X date, Y times, Z location 200v200 ) “very useful after BG’s are implemented and WPvP stops”  
---
– Note: *World PvP on a PvE server is 100% opt in. If you don’t want to PvP it’s impossible for you to even be attacked. It’s only for those that want to flag for PvP and participate.*

&gt;  so I decided 4 would be the best time to go
---
It may not seem like much, but remember there's xp for exploring. Starting your trip at 4 you should be fine though.
---
Hi, /u/Leckyd
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/car9ue/seems_like_everyone_wants_to_steer_clear_of_the/). 
---
I think it will initially have a ton of new players that eventually taper off once everyone has a 60 and has done raid content.  Probably will stay at a medium to low population until they start adding Classic+ content, whatever that may be.
---
It can feel like a burden early on, since you also need pet food and have 1 fewer bags. It does balance out rather quickly though.
---
It's a horrible system and honestly between that and LFG/LFR was the main reason WoW started to fail imo.
---
That being said I understand why they are implementing it into the launch of Classic. What needs to happen is limit it to only the first couple starting zones. It's so easy to take advantage of. If they leave it on based on just time, the first wave of 60s are going to abuse the hell out of it.
---
If they leave it on post level 20 zones, there's going to be a huge issue. Hopefully they learn to be proactive here instead of reactive.
---
I went through this the last few months, kept trying to understand what the "best" class to choose was. Then I realized the "best" is basically 4 classes (Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Priest) and I didn't want to play any of them. So I picked the class I thought would be most fun to play and ended up with Druid...
---
There's a few factors: the art style, location, and layout. The art style is the biggest one for me. Orgrimmar is just ugly to most people. Thunderbluff is way better to look at. The constant orange/red gets old and there's just not a whole lot of interesting or pleasing architecture in Orgrimmar. Stormwind and Ironforge far surpass Orgrimmar here.
---
Location is the next issue. Ironforge is the best overall located city in the game. Think about someone from Orgrimmar trying to do late game content. How are you going to get to BRD? Scholo? MC? BWL? Etc. You need to go take a Zepplin, get off, go into UC, wait for an elevator, and then fly for however long to your destination. For Ironforge, you're a short flight to BRD/MC/BWL, you can afk fly to the plaguelands. Even for ZG, flying to Darkshire and running to ZG is not that much more inconvenient than taking the Zepplin to STV.
---
I think the biggest factor in location is the fact you can afk fly to most spots from Ironforge but traveling from Orgrimmar requires you to babysit your character and manually get on and off Zepplins and then going to a flight master before you finally can afk fly somewhere.
---
Finally, the layout. Ironforge, SW, and Orgrimmar all have short distances between AH, bank, and flight master. Orgrimmar is not more convenient because you can easily repair, AH, bank, or fly from all those cities. I would actually give Ironforge the advantage because you don't need to dismount before getting to the flight master. I hate the spiral stairway leading up to Orgrimmar's flight master. It's just bad design and requires more attention than should be needed to just fly somewhere.
---
Tried out tailor/ench during K3 launch while I was leveling, just so I could be the first with the recipes and corner the market.
---
I was struggling for gold so hard as a priest it was a pain trying to balance upkeep with water while also leveling my profs at a constant rate. Think I spent about 5g every level for enchanting and 2 for tailor. While my rogue friends told me just before we hit level 40 they already had enough for their mount and then some. I never wanted to reroll so hard until now.
---
I'll never do that combo again while leveling. I was only able to get my mount with a loan from a friend but I learned my lesson. Fuck those two profs.
---
Ah yes, it's been about an hour since this was last posted.

Those are not changes to the core game, other than leeway, which I completely understand and I'd be flexible with. You want an excuse to be able to change the game in any stupid, horribly thought-out way Blizzard wants, under the guise "herp derp well it can't be 100% perfect anyways".
---
&gt;You really have absolutely no idea what you're even talking about, but you're one of the most vocal people in this thread. Take a break, go do some thinking or something. Educate yourself. The worst type of ignorance is vocal ignorance.
---
You seem like a Blizzard fanboy that doesn't understand layering, nor do you understand vanilla and what made it great.  At the very least you don't care or are simply short-sighted.  I'm guessing it's a combination.
---
This is amazing, great job! Holy crap, you're quite talented!
---
I'd love to play them, go get a job at blizzard and push classic+ won't you? :P
---
yes. CTS and Gressil wouldve been earned for DKP in a guild run with the raid on farm status, with higher drop rates probably. 
---
dal rend farming is a nightmare
---
Look at those fantastic buildings in Las Vegas - all paid for with money lost by gamblers.
---
I was also quite bummed to enver see a proper kobold dungeon. This scratches my itch!
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
---
Holy dang! You should make the current dungeons up in this manner! Awesome!
---
Obviously lal
---
RE: Classic Aura Durations &amp; OmniCC: No, these do different things. Classic Aura Durations shows how long is left on your DoTs/etc. on your target. OmniCC overlays the remaining cooldown time on top of your abilities/items on your bars, in your bag, etc.
---
RE: Storyline &amp; Immersion: yes, these serve the same purpose. I mentioned that I included immersion as an alternative to Storyline rather than including it to recommend both be used simultaneously.
---
&gt; So just a video of windfury procs and no actual PVP.
---
lmao at grey level enemies at that.
---
Thanks! I would not mind that.
---
I really dont have that many issues in beta. Pets issues at the start but not much right now. I see all the posts and maybe I'm an outlier, buy it's been relatively smooth. Raided Hunter in classic for a bit. It was definitely smoother then but it isn't terrible now I'm.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna to as soon as I hit 4 and train my skills.
---
That is funny :P +1
---
I'm sorry but winning the bis weapon ingame, my reaction would be alittle different compared to getting dal rends :P
---
I bet there's an addon that disables other players' sound effects, I'll take a look
---
maybe he thought you meant negligee.
---
World of Warcraft was basically Everquest half fixes + Warcraft IP
---
You criticize the guy from asking for a change that benefits a majority.  But at the same time you are gonna maintain to not change it because it benefits the minority.
---
Two sides of the same coin.
---

If there's anything more to it, it's not to my knowledge and not listed here.
---
How drunk are you right now? Because you’re making no sense.
---
&gt;especially if you have high tiered enchants.
---
Why you wont if your raid isn't funneling them to you.
---
what if my friends already picked a server and now that server is full. I should play alone on a low pop server?
---
You stop people all joining the same server the old fashioned way, login queues.
---
I was just browsing /Borderporn and bumped into [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderporn/comments/cajw5c/triple_border_brazilargentinaparaguai/). Naturally my first thought was what you see up there. This is getting unhealthy at this point.
---
Roll your guild on a low pop server. Blizzard violating the consistency of the world to bend over backwards to make sure that players never had any negative experience is how we got LFG, LFG, phasing, sharding, x-realm and so on.
---
You say "omg what if the player is a little annoyed?" Well guess what, if a little annoyance is the price for a consistent world, it's worth paying.
---
I cried it looks so accurate
---
AV isn't out right away I thought.  It's phase 2 or 3.
---
It is almost always "Not enough threat", not "too much mitigation" that causes you to wear some dps pieces, at least in raids. Some may say tomato, tamato though. The 1% dodge is just really irrelevant. It's not super great, but it certainly isn't BAD. It isn't "just not viable after BWL/MC because you dodge and don't get rage". Which was the above poster's statement.
---
It depends on whether the Hunter buys them from the auction house... or the vendor 1 building down from the auction house. 
---
No seriously, I may a ludicrous amount of gold from selling hunter ammo that I purchased from a vendor in Ironforge.
---
3 second stun on dwarf is ridiculously op racial :D dude has no common sense
---
Anything that starts after 12AM CST is what I'm looking for but 1AM would probably work best.
---
There's a trick, just requires a tiny bit more setup with an alt and a raid group.  So you need a friend to help setup the group.
---
Great counter argument. Nost was the most fun I've had with wow since Wrath and having so many people stuffed into it was a big part of that. The world actually felt populated, which is something few mmos can actually achieve.
---
Layering cant be in the game for Phase 2 (this has been confirmed by blizz and Ion himself). Do you think phase 1 is going to last a few months? And that is even in the extreme case that it stays in the game for all of phase 1. The intention is to have it for only the first some weeks and while players are still in the lower level zones. Of course we cant be sure it will only be a couple weeks but it very well may not be the whole of Phase 1 in an ideal world (per Ion/blizz).
---
Great video. Looking forward to more
---
&gt;  TO ANYONE ON THE FENCE ABOUT LAYERING- THIS IS THE KIND OF THING PRO-LAYERING PEOPLE THINK IS OK.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It also doesn't surprise me you have no understanding or care for immersion.  
---
&gt;Go back to retail.
---
No pro-layering people want to have the game experience when they have time to access it. I am not manipulating game mechanics, I am using the mechanics that are provided to me to finish a quest in appropriate time. Using your logic mounting is manipulating game mechanics to get an advantage over the people who can not mount.....
---
You still have not presented anything that solves, population issues, server merger issues. It is funny you are OK with a server merger....the MOST UNBLIZZARD, UN VANILLA thing ever........Go giver your head a shake.
---
LFR is the raid on training wheels and the max ilvl it gives you is worse than normal mode.
---
Happened in vanilla too. Also get ready to see "lfm dungeon full on *class/armor type*"
---
are there any perks of leveling leatherworking specifically with regards to druid gear (feral dps, tanking, balance)? Is it a worthy profession to have?
---
To be fair, if it's the tank yelling at us, and I am full on Mana and keeping her alive, I am cool with it.
---
When it's a huntard that overpulled, fuck that noise.
---
We tried this. No dice.
---
I wonder, how do they plan to keep track of  stuff for Ironman Classic considering we don’t even know if we’ll have an armory? Much less an API that contains statistics such as deaths or usage of items?
---
They have no plans.
---
I'm in the same boat OP!
---
I wonder if there are enough of us to form a noob guild
---
Arcane mages are just weird. 
---
^(and useless)
---
Some people prioritize their career, significant other, IRL priorities, and other hobbies more than WoW. Some people value WoW more, and choose to devote their time to that instead. It's a choice based on individual priorities.
---
Being OOM every time you res in a BG from buffing yourself.
---
I can’t wait to level enchanting solely to make this and then drop it and power level leatherworking for some BiS feral gear pre AQ just to drop that shit and power level either alch or engineering. Yay!
---
I think it'll have a large impact, even if you might disagree. The point isn't to "make friends" like it's a button you press. 
---
The game is supposed to force interaction by design, and preferably interaction with people you recognize from somewhere else you've met in game. The primary concern is that splitting people is a step in the wrong direction.. I hope you're right that the impact will be negligible
---
it's the best gold making prof so it's not like you are hurting yourself esp if you will focus on pve

Using execute lol
---
Beta ends in 4 days anyway.
---
that pun was an 8 point
---
I have. BUt we're talking 50-70k.
---
4 dps? Me am that kind of orc.
---
I actually grew to fucking hate Tuesdays because of modern WoW.
---
It's a shame you didn't even do 5 minutes of research instead of sperging out a wall of text on reddit. It could've saved you a lot of time. Keep sticking your head in the sand and refer to the beta which has layering active with like 40 people online lmfao.
---
I'm new! Been playing on a private server and preparing through guides/videos on levelling tips. The content that exists for helping new players catch up with the veterans is phenomenal, although I'll still probably be taking my time to fully immerse in the world. Speedlevelling seems like a really fun concept to me, but a few characters down the line.
---
Damn, that is a little too late for us. Best of luck finding that night owl guild!
---
You realize everyone on k1 rolled into k3 because we cleared naxx already a bunch right and content ran out ? K3 is very active and k1 will merge into k3 around classic launch. K1 is over 5 years old and my characters are in tact there. Nobody plays because the content is all finished which is what will happen to classic after phase 6, it’s normal and expected.
---
So do you think the best method will be to take your armour off and suicide? Then corpse run back? At least with mage dog farming you can just run back out and reset without having to /camp
---
Dude. Yes. So long as the boss dies and we don't wipe, who cares how high your dps was? It's a team fight.
---
Threat  &gt; Mitigation.
---
&gt; Feral kitty is underrated because he's tricky to optimize.
---
&gt; 
---
Are you suggesting that optimized feral cat play doesn't belong in the context of a min-maxed raid? 
---
Because I would agree with that, if you wanted to min max your raid as hard as possible you would bring a warrior dps, not a feral cat.
---
My main was a holy priest vanilla through wrath of the lich king.
---
Oh really?  Damn...  I actually got into tool because there was a thread on my vanilla guild's website about bands and someone linked some tool stuff in there...  We've come full circle.
---
Can't wait!
---
..... He thought the hunter was the healer?
---
Hahaha sure. I'll admit that. All I have left is complaining tho. I can't give that up too. 
---
But on a more serious note. You're a doo doo head! Bleh poo poo face!
---
Pretty much.
---
And this is exactly why I plan on rolling a Night Elf Priestess again.. Praise Elune!
---
I mean I have 4 kids and I game around 20 hours a week. 2-3 hours a night after they are in bed, more on weekends. Im up at 7 on weekends so we can't really even do much for 3 hours after I am up.
---
I also don't watch TV so my free time is mostly gaming.
---
Pandaren are an April fool joke turned into reality. I like them but don't think they have a place in the Warcraft universe.
---
Going with what this guy is saying, Joana is a fuckin machine who is put in thousands of hours to create a guide detailing his route. 
---
I'm a very experienced WoW player and it's quite difficult to stick exactly to his guide and achieve everything he achieves in sub 7 days played. A new player coming in with no experience? Yeah see you at 60 in like 3 months.
---
It's Phase 3, so sometime just before the holidays or right after.
---
Nothing wrong with traps
---
&gt;I will find it hilarious, however, when all the people from here who keep saying "it's not my vanilla wow" will play anyway... if you want your voice to have an impact, you need to stand on your principles and not play until layering is removed.
---
So if they take out layering you won't play, right?
---
Came here for the Benediction post.
---
If they're downranking and have good enough gear.
---
Thanks a lot for confirming this. I had planed to roll a gnome warlock and finish the starting zone quests then head to Elwynn. With it being possible to get the imp quest I guess I'll head over to Elwynn right away as a lvl 1.

that sort of bullshit is just an excuse rich people give for why theyre rich instead of the immoral exploitation that underlies their wealth 'creation'
---
Do humans and dwarves practice the same religion? Is that why they both have Desperate Prayer? I know little of Warcraft Lore, but have wondered this.
---
Why are virtually all of the items BoP even in the level 15 dungeon?
---
This fucken great
---
Can't upvote this enough
---
Not sure yet, i'll let you know when the time comes! COYS !!!
---
I exclusively use that skill for trolling purposes. "why did you not lof him out of that?"
---
"didn't want to have it on cooldown if a trolling opportunity came up"
---
That's technically a bug by blizzards definition. It shouldn't work like that and might only be doing that because of the tiny amount of players on the beta server which has side effects that won't occur with the massive population on launch.
---
lmao that's one way to kill classic
---
Without any solution, whether layering or not:
---
How many weeks could the ridiculous over crowding in game and wait times be? This is predicted to be a far bigger issue than it was for original Vanilla and private servers. Its possible that the entirety of that experience would be too much and in essence not "classic as classic was". Not to mention it will really suck to be a player dealing with that, especially one who has a full time job and other responsibilities that create limits on their gaming time.
---
And with regards to "short sighted and selfish":
---
How many potential players would be turned away due to those first weeks of problems, surely that would have a long term impact on the community and pool of players. This subreddit is going to be a real minority of who is trying out the game, big fans like ourselves are going to be willing to stick through however it may be, but can we expect that from more casual newer players? I have friends I would hope I can play with that I know would love the game of Vanilla WoW but if we are dealing with some weeks of issues im not sure il be able to get them to stay.
---
That above^ combined with a belief that the impacts of short term layering (as is intended, at the very longest stops before phase 2) wont destroy the soul of classic (not even close) is why there are people like myself that feel layering is the correct decision. (I am firmly behind a movement to attain clarity and fix bugs/issues to get it working as it is intended to minimize impact and exploits)
---
You dont need to vilify us just because your opinions differ, layering supporters sure get made out to be the evil bad guys.
---
My girlfriend and very close friend are both brand new. His wife has played back in TBC and I played through all expansions far more than I should have. That being said we are all excited to play together and it has grown beyond just the 4 of us to a group of around 15 other people we know in person that want to join our guild and have some fun. 
---
This is a great opportunity for those who missed the joy that we all had the first time to try and capture just a slice of it.
---
But then that means you went through the entire lvling experience without engineering to help in wpvp.
---
Oh man typical internet defense mode. You got called out on common knowledge for a game and now you’re back peddling with the overused madboy shit. Get yourself together dude
---
Sure. I agree with that. The fact still stands that the absolute richest people don't throw away their money on stupid frivolous shit. Doing so will eventually destroy your wealth as your purchases become increasingly idiotic. It's the mentality of not caring about your money I was pointing out.
---
I think when I saw kargoz leveling he said gear in invent gets broken too.
---
Very likely pre-load will be available.
---
Well there still is a larger available area than there are for the starting zones (and quite a few less people in those zones than there will be at launch in the starting zones) plus there is instanced content. 
---
Having vanilla caps would results in dead servers and the need for server merging pretty early on, due to the likely large drop-off of players after the first few weeks. 
---
I don't know blizzards exact plan obviously but it does seem they are aiming towards having a vanilla-like population on the servers after the drop-off, without their expected numbers it's of course pretty much impossible to know whether that goal seems realistic with amount of servers they plan on having. 
---
But your idea would likely result in old-guilds and friend not being guaranteed to be able to sign up to the same server if they don't already have that planned before launch, because the servers could be filled.
---
Can they really though?  That just means america has to bang their heads against the wall at whatever issues launch has.
---
Ay fuck outta here with that casual shit! You take a week off work, you turn day and night upside down before launch and then you can enjoy the game
---
I don’t care one way or the other, honestly. If someone abuses it to make more money, oh well. If I don’t see jimbob 3 days in a row, idgaf - I’m leveling with my friends.
---
Literally doesn’t bother me if it’s in or not
---
it's justified in every raid, with limited item drops the better you are the less people you can bring and the more loot you'll get.
---
Chess is pretty simple and slow, everyone sucks at it. Pace doesn't matter, thats why i constantly repeat why the direction of wow in TBC new spells and beyond where a mistake
---
That's only an estimate, we don't know the phases will be 4 months long it's just a guess based on how vanilla was.
---
That's definitely true. It's still WoW though... Not that I've played BfA
---
This shit right here is why I switched majors from translation to computer science in college.
---
You're a huge fucking tool and everyone on this sub and in your personal life knows it. Go whine somewhere else. Thanks.
---
As a former raid leader: if you know how to play your class but come initiated, you aren't a good player. You're decent. A good player is someone who plays their class and shows up on time with consumables ready to not waste time.  If you come unprepared to a raise your not only wasting your on time but everyone else's time.
---
Yeah, Mental agility is nice but not MANDATORY you know? It's especially nice on fights with heavy dispelling. And technically your raid will be fine with 1-2 priests having spirit buff as it costs less mana than fortitude buff. Just trade another priest buffs "I'll stam buff these 3 groups if you do spirit buff on them" type thing
---
&gt; Everyone's going to be a seller, few will be buying right away.
---
This actually gives a great advantage to buying early if you can swing it, but I think most wont be able to and also save for their mount.
---
This is fucking awesome. 
---
"You motherfucker why'd you loot that ring two months I've been to get that thiiing" 
---
The entire tell part was hilarious.
---
You cant have both tracking available in classic, so that's probably a bad idea.
---
I didn't say it was a bad thing. It just seems like some people are getting upset about item reservation, so they're probably gonna get upset when they aren't even allowed on runs in the first place.
---
Shh, #nochanges will hear you
---
1 berserker's plate please.
---
Yes, but killing quest mobs and grinding between quests is a huge time sink which he won't need to deal with.  So yes while quests don't gain rested xp bonus, the fact killing quest mobs will give him enough xp between quests will dramatically cut down on his leveling time to lets say, around half.
---
&gt; You criticize the guy from asking for a change that benefits a majority. But at the same time you are gonna maintain to not change it because it benefits the minority.
---
Philosophically I think it's wrong to change the game in a way that harms the experience of some players, even if changing it would benefit the experience of more players.
---
If our goal was to maximize how many people have a good experience, then we'd be adding guild banks and who knows what else. But that's not the goal with Classic, is it? We're getting the game as it was, even if your hardware can run it at 140fps and you have 15ms ping now.
---
Fuck layering.
---
Why not? I was always honest with my game, it made me a ton of easy cash
---
That seems to be a low guesstimate of the number of servers to me (I might be wrong), but with language specific servers, EU, US, Russia etc it will likely be quite a few more than that. 
---
Based on the amount of people creating accounts closer to the 27th blizzard will also see whether their estimates are holding up (of initial players) and then be able to respond to that with increasing the amount of servers is need be.
---
lol thanks man.
---
I wrote the druid song for a friend we called the Purple Monster, so I felt the pain of his greed every raid...
---
I relate more to the priest song though, as I mained a priest through most of the more difficult 40 man content.. hehe
---
I think bestial discipline is pretty imperative, I personally usually ignore pathfinding because having faster combat is probably 90% of the time better than slightly faster travel. Like it would probably only make a significant distance if your running somewhere that takes over 8 or 9 minutes. 
---
I would also pick up iaoth over endurance training as I never really noticed my pets getting that mauled unless something was going horribly wrong.

Who is telling you to go endurance? I never used it myself and i've leveled 3 hunters. imp hawk is super nice. You really should be hawk while killing if you kite to next targets properly the increased speed is useless.
---
Beastial swiftness is super nice definitely worth the 1 point. You can't always use dash and the pet moving from mob to mob when grinding makes a big difference is clear speed. 
---
Pathfinding is obviously sick.
---
Imp mend pet 1/2 is really useful indeed i definitely recommend getting it.I don't think 2/2 is necessary since you want to complete your mend pet cast for mana efficency and it will probably proc from that. 
---
I don't have room for spirit bond or bestial discipline. Discipline is the smallest of dps increases from talent and spirit bond really isn't neccesary since you should have 100% uptime as a hunter.
---
Not yet.

Yes because there's no way to properly regulate it against fraud.
---
You can advertise your gift wrapped "Mystery Box" COULD contain an Arcanite Reaper, but in reality there's nothing stopping you from filling them with half a stack of Peacebloom.
---
Unbalanced af. No need to touch class balance, it would just create more problems than it would solve.
---
Did I get called out though? Because I've reviewed this thread and I am failing to see where I made a claim of any sort. I was simply making a humble and innocent request for more evidence.  
---
But then you and yours became filled with so much rage, and a simple request has spiraled into this awkward situation where you're super mad about something and I'm just looking for information. It really is just a pickle.  
---
I've never felt so attacked on here before :( My friends were right it seems. This community has a bunch of toxic weirdos on it who fly off the handle at the smallest thing. I can't imagine being so unhinged....
---
Oh well. It's possible the data that says dungeon leveling is too slow doesn't exist. That's fine though, it was just a minor curiosity of mine. Something to pass the time. I'm planning on solo questing to 60 with one of the many available guides.
---
The tooltip say 50% reduced healing but in reality it's 100% because no healer can be arsed to heal that shit.
---
4 arms warriors + windfury. That sounds godtier for speed farming instances.
---
I didnt say "you shouldnt shame this guy", I said "I'm not gonna shame this guy".
---
If he wants to eat his Vanilla ice cream with a fork, then I'm just gonna be happy he's enjoying it.
---
YOU maybe honest, but when it comes to gold, much like real money, most are quite dishonest to get their profits.
---
I always take IAotH but then again I like being able to extra DPS in dungeons I can see why the min/max leveling builds would choose endurance instead. Bestial Swiftness is more PvP orientated but it is nice having it for any scenario, your pet turns into a bullet that can pick up any mob that's running away, you won't notice it until you don't have it. Like you said though a pet with Dive/Dash can be used instead, it just takes a little more managing. Pathfinding is a must. For me the choice comes down to a point in Bestial Discipline or Spirit Bond. The choice is up to you, are you more DPS focused and does your pet have a focus dump = BD, do you want to be more tank = SB.

My druid Fernclaw was a day 1 Tichondrius &lt;Dread Ninja Pirates&gt; homie. I want layering, because I remember hating the queues, and I fully believe the populations will plummet after a few weeks, and don't want to be on a dead server with no economy
---
i like this very much
---
Tl;d give a fuck
---
Last I knew, it was against the EULA and I do remember a crack down on it back in the day.
---
Your mileage may vary but it's not worth the ban hammer.
---
So much truth.  So few players who realize this.
---
That's only true for spirit res. Gear not worn does not break from deaths, I really thought kargoz knew what he was on about...
---
You literally always had a choice. Each realm you picked is in a physical data center. You didn't have to play on a west coast server, you could play on an east coast or central server. The servers are all mostly in Chicago now, but they were distributed among multiple datacenters specifically so people could play with lower ping.
---
"Single fights where a Warlock might outdamage a Mage are insignificant unless you're swapping players between fights."
---
I just showed you 4 fights in BWL (literally 50% of the bosses) where warlocks can/will out dps mages and you think that is insignificant? Plus I know from experience that warlocks can out dps mages on any fight, there is a lot of RNG involved in wow, things such as critical strike chance. You might have 30% crit worldbuffed and have 55% of your casts on a 2 minute boss fight be crits. This isn't even taking into account player skill or who goes harder on consumables.
---
"The damage of the Warlock plus this debuff is not as good as just bringing another melee or Mage."
---
This is absolutely not true. Ignoring that you think for some reason mages do hundreds of DPS more than warlocks. Ask your tanks if they want less threat on a boss because it has more armor. You would lower your whole raids dps by lowering the threat of the tanks? Ask your melee if all 10-15 of them would like less dps because you only want 1 warlock in the raid. This is laughable.
---
I'm done debating with you as I have pretty much laid everything out and it seems neither of us is changing the other's mind. People who are uncertain can read this back n forth and decide for themselves.
---
One game mode I was thinking about recently (which could be done if they added ways to de-level) - if you died, your character drops levels until a multiple of 10, so each time you hit 10, 20, 30, you are safe.  Die at 59, you have to do 50-60 all over again.
---
You’d actually be PI-weaving, You’d be a massive utility bot, which holds a lot of value in raids, with less in 5mans. You won’t be ideally spec’d but would still be able to easily heal 5man content. Shadow priests can already heal that content, you’ll at least have a few more talents to do the job a little better (plus casters will love you for PI even in Strat/BRD/etc).
---
Iirc it was gambling in general? Remember people running casinos
---
When your healer stops and drinks to full after every single fight
---
"mooseface"
---
Yes we want server crashes, queues and an unplayable game (for most) in the launch week /s
---
My point was that competitive DPS doesn't matter to like 95% of players (the ones who aren't in min-maxing guilds). You said "MCP or bust if you're trying to do DPS", which isn't correct. You also imply viability rides on having the best of runes/pots/MCP, which also isn't true. Your comment is staged in competitive raiding, but reads like you're staging it in the majority experience. My point is that there's a hivemind assumption that you need to be competitive to be viable. Those are two entirely different playstyles.
---
You're such a meanie :(
---
Shouldn't F the tank while he's busy.  There's plenty of time for F'ing later.
---
This is really cool man.
---
I am hoping that Blizzard does take the Classic+ route. I loved TBC, but it just leads to Wrath which leads to a guaranteed exit.
---
At least Classic+ would leave the small possibility of a longer life. As long as the current core Classic team were the ones making the design decisions, it would be possible that Classic+ content does well.
---
I just watched the other two you posted in your other comment and these are great. I hope Purple Monster is honored to have such a good song about him
---
Yea but not everyone who lives in the east coast was playing on an East coast server.  You could have just fucked up your decision when you created your character.
---
Now by default everyone is hitting a datacenter close to them
---
Hypothetically, they can. How smooth it all goes remains to be seen.
---
I lost the first offhand I saw drop to a tank who didn’t realize it wasn’t one hand...
---
hah! His play style hasn't changed in 15 years of playing MMO's with him. He is honored, I'm 100% certain.
---
Warrior-
---
slow? yes, but leveling isnt about getting to max level, its about enjoying the journey to max level, and as such can feel very fun and rewarding to play, especially if you know what your doing, as ive seen a very skilled warrior pull 10+ mobs same(ish) level mobs and win, and gear dependancy isnt that bad at max level as thats where all the gear is, it just means youll feel your self get better as you get better gear over another class like a mage
---
Mage-
---
human mages are fine, your trading the tiniest bonus in int for the tiniest bonus to spirit and perception and diplomacy
---
Paladin-
---
Paladins arent weak, but i assume you mean they cant be amazing dps, and this is true, a paladins dps is overall lack luster, but its not unviable, and considering your apparent casualness with this game it is quite possible youll get into a more casual guild as a dps paladin (if thats what you want to do)
---
Hunter-
---
hunters have many great aspects to them, they are the best solo-ers in the game with a pet to tank, mail armour, and impressive kiting abilities, they are great gold farmers, and great pvpers
---
and whilst it is often joked that hunters are just moral support in raiding the truth is (especially during the earlier phases of the game) that their dps is fine and they provide many useful utilities such as pulling with their longest range, and their tranquilzing shot
---
I'll check this out. Thanks.
---
By making that concept available to every class would remove the uniqueness that it provides.
---
It's that same thing we say, not every class has to be the same, flavor exists due to minor things like this.

Deerdeertion

Would love it to be viable at least ;)
---
I hope they ban anyone who runs them.
---
K1 had a full healthy life cycle. People ran out of things to do. To use this as a knock on private servers because there’s no additional content is silly. I personally love fresh world vanilla experiences and I understand their lifespan is finite. The players also wanted it this way. With classic many people want 1.13 classic plus and I’m quitting if they decide to do tbc plus. All these classic servers will have the same fate if they get locked with nowhere to go. Anyway your argument is silly. Kr0n05 has been active the entire time I’ve been playing. What you said about lack of activity is misinformed.
---
Think mage is the way to go here. Mage are a beast at farming gold and won't be excluded from raids.
---
That said all the other options not that far behind. 
---
Hunters are also a beast at farming gold, but you'll need nightfall or something to be useful in raids. 
---
Paladins have a slow clear speed, but they can aoe farm in epl. Next to healing they are fairly good tanks for dungeons. Moderately difficult to play properly, and naturally slow levelers. 
---
Warrior, does not farm as fast unless you have gear. Play this if you are interested in tanking and if you are in a guild or play with friends who can help you out gearing.
---
I think it might need a bit more than 2 weeks, but I agree with the sentiment. However I'm not sure whether they have the capacity to do layering like that. 
---
Don't really see the need for server "split" though, it's much simpler to just make fresh servers and allow free transfers to these in my mind.
---
I really don't see how you cannot understand that if your chance to hit is 2% higher, you do a tiny bit more than 2% more damage.
---
How is this concept eluding you? You are surely trolling?! How can you mention the 1.25% with a straight face?
---
At 300 weapon skill you have 8% chance to miss
---
At 305 weapons kill you have 6% chance to miss.
---
In the first case you do 92% the damage that 0% chance to miss would do.
---
In the next case you do 94% the damage that 0% chance to miss would do.
---
You are doing (94% - 92%) / 92% more damage.
---
That is 2.2% more damage.
---
What part of this "entirely incorrect" math are you not getting?
---
&gt; Aw~~ful~~esome
---
If it is in a tree you are already putting points in, then always take movement speed buffs for your character.  It's always worth it.

Those guilds are the worst. Where there's a couple with both of them being either guild leaders, officers or a combination. Piss off the female; get gkicked by the male. Because of said male refuses, then no sex. Literally happened to me once. Avoid those guilds at all costs. Also avoid guilds where the core consists of a real life friends group. But that's another subject for another day.

Regardless I think it is still done. There's one up on Stormrage NA all the time, two accounts and seems basically automated.
---
I’m SO DAMN stuck between warlock and hunter as my alt (possibly main) with my warrior
---
Yeah that can be pretty frusterating until you drop a max rank PoH for full healing in your group for sweet creamy justice
---
**Well 1st you start with gold ore and then you smelt it....**... ohhh you mean gold as In money, my bad....
---
&gt;Now, people will be popping in and out all the time which sucks. It will make it harder to get to know people too.
---
That's not how it works. It shouldn't do that. 
---
&gt;where you could choose which layer you wanted to join like an actual realm, and you would be stuck on that until they merged them
---
This is not a solution as it does not solve the problem of over population as people will join one of these sub realms over another because of a draw. This draw may be a major guild, streamer, or anything else. This one subrealm will be come over populated, have queues, etc or they will population cap it and then you can not play with your friends until it comes to a point where they merge realms. This is not a good solution as it does nothing for population control, queues or server stability but still has the same greater issues of community disruption, AH disparities, and everything else.
---
Timbermaw rep was always important to me just so I could get to MG and WS.
---
Speaking of rep - Who sides with Gelkis or Magram in Desolace?
---
Seriously.  WoW was shit on so much for being extremely easy compared to earlier MMOs.  It really was, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  I do think that a lot of what made the game *"hard"* back then was simply that a lot of the class design didn't make any sense.
---
That's not how percentages and chance work man.....
---
This reminds me of when flat earthers try and do physics.
---
Seriously just stop, this is embarassing.
---
Should've said if the hunter died and asked why you didn't heal "it's part of my macro to not heal orc macros".
---
Casual isn’t just playtime, but also mindset. Many (more than you’d think) just don’t care to push themselves. They won’t care to learn mechanics and rotations and such, which will lead them to struggle through what many more serious raiders will consider easy content.
---
So when you say “most guilds”, remember that you mean “most more serious raiding guilds” which is far different than “most guilds that dabble in raiding”.
---
I don’t know if we consider 20-man ZG or AQ raids, but there are particular fights there where hunter mana drain stings are clutch.  Also fights like Hakkar and that final boss in AQ-20 where their ability to distracting shot and drag things away are central to the fight.
---
They already stated in an interview that it is a museum project, not for profits. They said they would keep classic running even if only 10 people logged in every day as long as Blizzard exists.
---
Glad you like it. I think Classic+ or some kind of seasons system would be the way to go. Who knows they might be working on it right now, after having seen Runescape having success with adding content.
---
I've already stated I played both K1 and K3 so I don't see why you're still accusing me of being ignorant and peddling misinformation.
---
Engi tailor are the min max professions. You get Robe of the Archmage phase 1 and the 2% crit bonus in Bloodvine for pve (requires 300 tailoring for the set bonus, not to equip). Engi has sapper charges for pve aoe fights and all the useful pvp items / grenades
---
I loved pulling people in lfr to the edge of the platform and watch them run off the edges.
---
94 years of classic with always the same hunter bugs...
---
What low Population server? You have a few hundred thousand people trying to squeeze onto servers that will generally be able to hold about a tenth of that.  
---
and it ain't about "omg what if the player is a little annoyed" it's more about "omg, can we ensure that players are able to actually play the game?"
---
engineering doesnt have a whole lot to offer for gold making.  
---
furthermore its one of the most popular professions, so if theres any significant profit margin itll quickly be extinguished..
---
It was laggy because it was the best they could do on their budget (and the servers located in France didn't help if you weren't EU).  Blizz presumably wouldn't have those constraints.
---
Dynamic spawns is 1000 times better than having sharding/layering/etc.
---
People act like Will of the Forsaken is a checkmate in any 1v1, it's not. It lasts 5 seconds, and after that you can just reapply another fear and drain life and you're back.
---
With engineering you get access to jumper cables and parachute, rocket boot etc, totally worth but will be a net monkey sink
---
How would your response change if Blizzard announced that the technology didn't work how you want them to implement it, and they can't just apply it to certain zones?
---
To be clear, they have not said this, it is just being inferred based on how it is being implemented. Also to be clear, this is a pretty commonly suggested "fix" that I happen to agree with, I just don't believe it to be possible to actually implement.
---
Is the druid blowing all of that? Doesn't seem like it, outside of the usual elixirs and such, not going too bonkers.
---
So this is baseline, class vs class, without any kind extras - engineering, rage pots, thistle tea, etc. We should fully expect  anyone who is raiding past MC, is using the baseline consumables of at least elixirs.
---
If someone wants to drop a thousand gold per raid, just to fap as they are top damage by using sapper charges on cooldown, and every other spike pot under the sun on cooldown, world buffs, etc... so be it. That doesn't make someone "GOOD", makes them a meter whore. There are **ZERO** fights in vanilla where you bring nothing but rogue/warrior/mages as DPS as there is no other way to clear it.
---
Doesn't matter. It's how the game worked back then and a lot of us didn't have 3rd world internet 14 years ago, we had fiber. We've made a big deal about no changes almost bullying Blizzard to put spell batching back in. We brought this on our selves
---
Gotcha, that has been my line of thinking thus far thanks for the confirmation. In that case then, Layering does have an effect on queues (unlike as mentioned in the original comment above).
---
I like sonii.

But when he yells "for the horde" its cringey as fuck
---
**&lt;Calamitous Intent&gt; [NA] [PvP] [Alliance] [18+] [PST]**
---
**Guild Type**: PvE (Plan to clear all content)
---
**Time Zone**: Pacific Standard Time (PST)
---
**About Us**: &lt;Calamitous Intent&gt; is currently being built by a group of friends who dearly loved World of Warcraft in its heyday. With the announcement of Classic, our worlds were turned completely upside down and we are ecstatic to begin this journey together with all of you. &lt;Calamitous Intent&gt; will strive to be a mature and respectful group of people, yet still encourage (*cough* require) silly behaviour and plan to have tons of laughs and fun in the process. All of our founding members are 21+ and have raiding experience during various stages of the game.
---
**Our Goal**: We aim to be a semi-hardcore raiding guild. What does semi-hardcore mean? It just means that we want to take raiding seriously while we are doing it, but at the same time we have real life responsibilities so we cannot raid as much as the most hardcore of guilds. What this amounts to is a reasonable schedule for raiding with the expectation that our raiders will be as prepared as a hardcore raider.
---
We are looking for both raiders and casual members to foster a strong guild community. We expect casual members to help out with farming on rare occasion when needed to aid the raid team.
---
**Requirements**:
---
You must be 18+ years old. We will most likely make small exceptions to this rule but only once we spend time playing with a person in game and feel that they can adhere to a raid schedule and mesh well with the guild.
---
**Raiding**:
---
* Schedule: M, Tu, Th (Optional Wed depending on progression) from 8-11 PST
---
* Loot System: DKP
---
**Recruitment**: 
---
* Currently recruiting all classes/roles except for Main Tank
---
* Excluded specs for raiding: Prot Paladin, Ret Paladin

---
This is correct, pvpers love bombs, and all of the toys.
---
Underrated hot take.
---
I mean, it's not like guild leadership is a meritocracy.
---
Can always spot the eve player
---
these bombs/consumables are significant for pve tryhards aswell :x
---
Grampa is saying these young whippersnappers are morally corrupt with their Elvis hip shakes and their avocado toast.
---
Would make more sense if you think of my guesstimate it as a "per region" thing. i.e. 12 - 14 in the US, 24 in EU/Russia... but tbh I should have specified that so that's on me.  
---
that said, i honestly expect new servers to pop up more towards the middle or end of Phase 1, which would give them more time to see population numbers going into the end of layering.
---
I’m trying to get a buddy to play but he’s like, “bro, I need to keep my job and girlfriend”
---
You can only track one thing at a time, so if you are a herbalist/miner its not that great. Its still useful to check chest spawns you know, but dont want to go and check directly. Like a chest inside a house with lots of mobs, or when you are running above a cave.
---
I'm pretty against this line of argument. Whether or not we are for or against mechanic X, Y, or Z, we should be doing what we can to field discussion, educate, and promote the community. 
---
Encouraging people to stay home or quit when they don't get their way, regardless of your position, is really counter productive to what we all want.
---
Ah good old good thing/bad thing penguin, a staple of Facebook memers.
---
Oh yeah. Then I think you are closer to the right numbers, hopefully blizzard will be keeping a close eye on this and adjust the server numbers accordingly
---
!RemindMe 47 days
---
is this pre 1.12? those crits are crazy. 5k+ on one of them. Was this before they removed certain trinkets being stacked, since in the big crits clips, you can see he has multiple buffs. I dont think these numbers are possible in 1.12
---
~1-90 poison quest
---
~90-170 SM
---
170-175 SM door
---
175-260 ZF
---
260-300 BRD
---
This isn't actually affected by layering. You should still have this launch of thousands of people. It's 3000 people per layer or something? (it's the same amount as original classic server capacity). So that means a few hundred or so in each starting zone.
---
Getting tons and and tons of MCPs is going beyond of your way. What I compared with the Warriors is not even remotely close to MCP farming, that’s my point.
---
Ambush and backstab gives you a lot of burst. Chew through clothies. If you're worried about combo points you can always go seal fate.
---
Still better than any other racial against locks. Those 5 seconds can be crucial.
---
&gt; Blizzard has the numbers on server rush and populations. They've got a better idea than a bunch of arm chair redditors about server loads.
---
I think this is an under appreciated stance. The stress tests had a lot to do with layer testing as well. I understand it's easy to be pessimistic and downplay Blizzard's ability to be successful, but that seem's antithetical to simply being happy and hoping to enjoy what is produced.
---
Appreciate the insight.
---
Now we must come up with ultimate memorable names that stick deep within the minds of the alliance so that when they see our horns come over the horizon they know...
---
You should try searching for [dagger](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9og54/how_good_are_dagger_rogues/).  There's even a [class thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bmw7hc/classy_friday_rogues_may_10_2019/).  Sadly I can't find the guy who posted [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XVtDMipgFw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=220) to give him props, but you should watch it.
---
No changes. Classic should remain a museum piece

Huehuehue
---
No no no no, you see, it’s not gambling because you don’t get any money in return.  What you get a random toy.  It’s like kinder eggs.
---
I always struggled with people being out of range when I was supposed to "raid heal" such as on Rag where people are very spread out. Is there an add-on or something that helps with that? Or were we just too disorganized?
---
Life &gt; death. Parry haste will get you killed in seconds especially since you have to wear a bunch of DPS gear to make up for the loss of shield slam.
---
I think in most pvp scenario sub is too good to pass up. Even with seal fate you’ll barely get 2 backstabs in before the enemy reActs. And if neither crit you have nothing to work with
---
Female characters can also use /kneel
---
That's not actually what layering affects. You will still see hundreds of people in your starting zone trying to kill the mobs. Its only function is to reduce the amount of dead servers after all the tourists leave. (which will be a massive amount of the initial players)
---
When vanilla came out, we still had MySpace uphill both ways and we liked it!
---
**```&lt;Rapid Evolution&gt; OCE - PvP - Committed Casual ```**
---
**Rapid Evolution** was an original hardcore vanilla PvP and raiding guild on Frostmourne(A) that is making a comeback for Classic WoW, though this time as **horde**. The core of the guild are all vanilla veterans and would love to find some old vanilla friends, though we welcome all that wish to join us. 
---
As 14 years has passed since RE first grinded through the PvP ranks and raid content, we expect Classic to be a little bit more casual and relaxed. We harbour no dreams of server domination but we will be pushing through all that classic has to offer and reliving the vanilla experience.
---
**__Raid Schedule__**
---
We will be raiding 2 nights per week, 
---
Monday and Thursday evening 8pm - 11pm AEST. 
---
As we will only be raiding 2 nights a week we plan to pack as much action with a little downtime as possible so we will expect those that wish to raid to be well prepared and reliable. note we will be using EPGP loot distribution.
---
**__Recruitment__**
---
We currently have no class restrictions or any strict requirements, welcoming everyone - We will continue to build our numbers once classic has launched to ensure that everyone has a fun and rewarding levelling experience with plenty of guildies to call upon for grouping and dungeons. 
---
If you have goals of raiding you will get your opportunity with us, as preparation and reliability will be rewarded. 
---
While we don't expect to participate in the Grand Marshall grind this time around we all love it and will be PvPing regularly, particularly large scale world PvP!
---
Come, Join our discord and introduce yourself!

Do you pwn fishes?
---
But that's my point, unless you're top tier it's really not.
---
Boomkin would have a field day with all that +arcane gear
---
Not new to WoW but didn’t start until WoWLK feels like it’ll be a whole new experience.
---
I studied physics you moron. Go ahead and point out the error then.
---
I don't know if the technology would be able to work that way, it seems more feasible than restricting layering to certain zones based on the little we do know about layering.
---
I think it's a decent idea, but there are situations where it causes things to break down. Such as instance groups (exiting or getting to the instance).
---
So should be able to sell bombs?
---
I miss mana burn :(
---
There are quite a few "gimme the queue then" posts, and I am curious how many people *really* mean they would be okay with a queue, and how many believe they would be "one of the lucky ones" who got in before everyone else. 
---
My biggest takeaway is that people against layering are failing to understand the scope of the issue, or are misunderstanding core mechanics of layering which is causing unnecessary backlash. I wish people would come to this with more willingness to actually understand the situation before developing a hardened opinion. I may be speaking about the world and broader subjects than WOW at this point though.
---
Why am I so torn on Hunter vs Warlock? I really can’t decide. They’ll be my alt to my warrior and I’d love to do light pve and PVP with them. I really need a breakdown of them besides the “hunts suck late and warlocks suck early” stuff.
---
You came out of this looking really good. No sarc
---
If your raiding I'd spec whatever gear u get.   I'd your pvping for gear u can just use lobotomizer.  I went to marshal with Lobo in 2006.
---
yes but with a low margin because a lot of people can do this (it doesnt even require a recipe iirc)
---
I did that,  lost 17 times in a row. Never gambled since and then when I turned 18 to gamble IRL the thought makes me sick.
---
Not sure what you mean. Elemental Invasions were added in 1.4 and were not seasonal.
---
Mithril Spurs
---
Why would you hate Orgrimmar?
---
 You should be be able to make gold early on a new server by crafting quest items with engineering if you level it up fast. For example Deadly Blunderbuss on horde side and bronze tube on Alliance side. Both require 100+ in engineering. 
---
 I would think that Blunderbuss is going to be the more profitable one but I could be wrong. Reason being there are vendors that sell bronze tube as limited supply with a fairly fast restock rate I think. Also since it's a lower skill recipe and requiring less materials, probably more people making them.
---
Shedo explains why it's not worth using tigers fury. He goes into a lot of detail on optimizing the feral rotation
---
find a consumables spreadsheet and cross reference with classicdb. have fun
---
Tailoring has the only notable BoP crafts, related is the bloodvine set that has a set bonus that requires tailoring. 
---
LW is devilsaur &amp; hide of the wild (tribal), black dragonscale. 
---
BS has spurs, nightfall, tank resistance gear, titanic plateguards, hammer for hand of rag.
---
credit to u/Knight_of_Thorns for the idea
---
Yeah well his game had a loot bug, massive server issues, and awful talents when it released... 
---
Maybe he should have built a system to better handle the shit at release.
---
A d the ugly ass green short pants!
---
I'll translate: "Waaaaaahhhhhhhh"
---
&gt; I honestly don't believe hunters were ever meant for raiding
---
I mean, go ahead and kill Chromaggus/Huhuran without hunters.
---
In leveling yes. End game, even then the herb/ore resources of vanilla in no ways support 10k people. but if they did a dynamic respawn to those lootable objects post layering that could be viable.
---
Staves instead of 1handers
---
HERESEY
---
I played an orc rogue for 3 years.....genuinely thought the blood fury symbol was a bloody, blackened eye. Dam my old comp was garbage. But on topic now, yes blood fury and tanking dont mix. Also if you got heals at your side in a bg and you use this, fully expect them to let you die, your not worth the mana anymore.
---
Plan that drops from a lot of different mobs on a low chance, and definitely useful. Thanks :)
---
Daggers is basically trading less combo points (because your builder costs more energy), for more sustained damage. It also makes really good use of energy gain (ie ZG trinket/thistle tea). Hemo can struggle with constant dps, it relies a lot in CB evis. This makes it fairly weak vs matchups like druid/warlock/warrior where your control only gets you so far. A dagger rogue is much more scary in that situation. It's also better probably in BGs and group combat situations where you often won't be able to get the opener or blind or kite or whatever, if you're just spamming a builder and spender spamming backstabs is much better than spamming hemo.
---
Its about 10-12 days played assuming you don't do anything outside of leveling. 
---
WotLK sped up leveling a lot by making lower level players quite a bit stronger compared to mobs and increasing the xp gain. I remember leveling in WotLK and not even getting to the end zones of vanilla or tbc before going to the next expansion's content.
---
Things will get even more interesting as we get closer to launch.
---
Level up adaptability to get some extra i-frames
---
But people regard Kara as one of the best raids ever.
---
I'm looking forward to an hour spent being an hour spent.
---
 I play BFA and the first hour spent per day is so much more valuable than each hour after that. as a shift worker this really sucks because some days I do 12 hours and don't want to log into world of homework to facilitate being able to participate in the fun part of the game being dungeons/raids.
---
The day classic comes out it's all I'll play.

&lt;Competent Casuals&gt; | NA | Alliance-PVE | Casual / Semi-Serious Raiding | Central Standard Time
---
ABOUT US
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
GOALS
---
We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec or so. Take your time, enjoy this revival of classic we've been waiting so long for but don't forget we're here to raid at some point. So be ready for that as well.
---
RAID SCHEDULE
---
We're thinking a mid week raid once ZG, AQ20 rolls out but for the main raid group Fridays and Saturdays evenings are likely. We'll adjust depending on whos recruited into the guild. 2-3 hour raid nights on the weekends with the weekday ones being 2 hours or so. 
---
LOOT
---
Right now we’re thinking a variation on DKP and Loot Council. The more you help the more gear you get but there’s going to be moments here and there where a tank should get first dibs to help the whole raid progress. Thats just an example but you get the picture. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins. 
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules etc.
---
For more info please checkout our website https://www.competentcasuals.com/
---
Again, check out our website for rules before joining, but here’s our discord.

---
They might just announce TBC release
---
I'm all for filling in the blanks on missing quests, like how Call of Air for shamans is quite clearly just cut off. There's various quests like that, as well as classes/levels that don't have a class quests or proper rewards.
---
But adding racial spells for every class... is rather dangerous territory.
---
Dude i knew it. DAOC was the best mmo of all time (hey i like wow also.) 
---
I am pretty sure the OP to this sub thread was projecting. Because at the time of vanilla i can remember the mess it was and how everyone wasn't more servers, stable servers, wanted mobs to loot because you killed darn bandits and you got stuck looting for those darn red bandanas (okay i have mentioned this a few times sorry i can remember this so well. I literately just played daoc for a while until it was more stable. It was real bad.) 
---
There is no way any of these people remember this or they just had no other games to play so they took what they could get.
---
Yeah. I get the feeling those on the discord are the ones in for the long haul. Hopefully those "tourists" we keep hearing about will fall in love with classic.
---
Lol hell yeah dude. Something about defending cows. Maybe something vegan. Like eatsnomeats
---
You can't *really* replace treasure finder with an addon, unless you don't mind going to physically check spawn points as the addon show them to you. Honestly, the cliche of "play what you like" is kinda true. It's hard to enjoy a character you don't like looking at for the long run.
---
Gotta say though, I know that dwarves aren't everyone's favorite... but I think they look fantastic visually. And stoneskin is pretty damn good.

**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
First team: Tues/Sun, 8pm – 11pm CST 
---
Second team: Wed/Mon, 7:30pm – 10:30pm CST 
---
**Loot System:**
---
Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
•    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
•    The most well-organized guild you’ll ever be part of—ask any of our veteran members what they think
---
•    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
•    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
•    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 1 Extremely Talented Dwarf Priest, 1-2 Warlocks, 1 Fury
---
Team 2 1 Dwarf Priest, 1 Warlock
---
Team 3 Looking for a guild or group of individuals to kick-start and lead this team!
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
That actually sounds great. 
---
Orcs could've become Blademasters and Shamans would get their own version of a Death Knight.
---
Pretty sure he meant survive in-game :)
---
Agree.

---
The population trend will not look like vanilla's did but more like WoD and if lucky cata.
---
Just so expectations are set, they have already stress tested with layering and with the time left till launch, I don't believe there are any major changes coming down. This is mostly theoretical.
---
I am curious, so you honestly believe Blizzard just didn't think about the possibility of applying layering to only the first few starting zones?
---
It goes like this:
---
Every priest is a shadow priest
---
Wars are the best tanks, but they aren't always the best tank spec and just rely on taunt.
---
Mages are the best overall dps in raids, but their gear doesn't come from raids. 
---
Shamans are for totems and the totems will always be out of range. 
---
Warlocks don't know what soul shards are. 
---
All rogues are ninjas.
---
Hunters will miss Traq shot. How? I don't know, they should be hit capped. 
---
Paladins have two health bars.
---
Druids can do everything, but you will never play with someone who does everything well.

I played feral in naxx and my warriors and rogues loved be
---
Gotta have that LotP buff
---
Exactly what i was thinking. Lazy ass repost will have my dislike :)
---
Escape artist does nothing for vanish.
---
Very real question. I understand you can buy some pretty good boe gear but the best is always bop. How does gold help you there other than providing consumables without farming? Also, I understand you would have mounts without effort, but I don’t see that as having a huge impact as both 40/60 mounts will be extremely commonplace. Lastly, I could see you being able to grind crafting professions straight to 300 but many of the best recipes are also found while raiding/require a lot of effort to obtain. 
---
I don’t see Classic as a game where you can buy gold and instantly be on par/ahead of someone who has spent their time grinding for themselves. It may make some things easier but it is not the key to greatness in WoW.
---
Perhaps there’s something I’m missing.
---
Definitely agreed about adding unique racials for each class heh. My  bad, didn't mean to say they ought to do that.

But this thread made me think about some unfinished, unpolished things. For example, there's a whole long adventuring quest for druids to get aquatic form (it's actually pretty long and requires one to run/swim around all over the continents searching underwater for some lock boxes), there's a cool quest for bear form, and then there's just purchasing cat form/travel form from your trainer. You can tell that they just ran out of time and resources to flesh those things out.

Or grassfed. Or grasspowered.

Yeah, of course. But it's not bad is my point. Like having a shadow priest and a proper specced healer instead of a weave specced holy priest and a "proper" dps isn't that much worse. Having a ret/enhance/boomy instead of a proper dps is quite a lot worse.

&gt;Layering is static, that's how it works. I don't know if you are genuinely confused or just being disingenuous so that you can more easily hate the system.
---
It's literally not, which is the entire problem?  You seem pretty well-spoken, how is your head so buried in the sand? Log out and back on? Switched to a different layer.  Join a party with someone i a different layer? Switched layer.  Also, other people switching layers for the same reasons.  So both you and others are switching layers pretty often.  The point being; you will NEVER be in the same layer with a consistent group of players as you level.
---
&gt;Layering will be abused forever! its temporary, with a set maximum end
---
There is currently a projected end.  It is not set in stone by any means.
---
&gt;You will login to different people each time! literally not how it works at all, you are set to a static layer on creation
---
This is not true!!!! Why do you think this?!?  Whoever told you this is wrong!  Hell, there is video of people switching layers *while they are playing*.
---
Watch this video if you actually give a shit.

I've said this about many betas. Sometimes they get fixed and sometimes they launched plagued with known bugs. I have some faith because they are listening to the community especially with the stealth animations, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Having longer phases is a good way to make people unsub and wait for the next phase.
---
I side with Magram because I like the way their name sounds more than Gelkis. I don't remember at all if there was a point or even anything decent from getting rep in those factions but I plan on doing it.
---
Cool? They don’t realize another Warrior or Rogue would be infinitely superior. Like I said, any guild that allows cats doesn’t have high quality players.
---
I don't get how this counts as a repost.

Captain got to the semi in the duel tournament - he's a young lad but he's good

Are they changing it to the new version for Classic or something?
---
That’s not why people get bored. They get bored because the initial rush has worn off and we’re back to the same old boring content with none of the excitement of a fresh server rush.
---
Really enjoying these, thanks!

RoseArt is just as good as Crayola! Just as good! - Druids

As a Hordesman, I look forward to making the long trek over to Deadmines and experiencing this bad boy myself for the first time soon.

If people get pissed off because someone else got loot that was a better upgrade for that person than for themself then maybe they shouldn't be in the guild if they can't look towards what's best for said guild. We brought a few trials in during BoD this tier just gone and if they get the biggest upgrade from a drop, they got it, just like everyone else. If you're worried about people leaving your guild after getting loot then dipping for another guild, then clearly your guild isn't good enough to be worth staying in anyway.

Classic isn't no changes. If you are dead set on no changes you need to go play a pserver what updates their info from data gather from classic.
---
Classic's entire api , geometry (the surfaces of the world and how your character interacts with them), and tons more aren't vanilla at all. they are using the 7.x core, they cannot be the same. So if you are a nochanges person you have to look else where.
---
No if you just want as little changes as possible layering is less change than a dynamic re-spawn for 9k players. Now you might say queue servers at 3k. But this is also not vanilla like as they were lower at release and the population growth of vanilla was large were is classic will have a pop drop off.  
---
In short you cannot recreate the vanilla wow experience. However blizzard is attempting to at least attempting to mimic it.
---
this isn't going to occur in classic.
---
Depends on the speed of the weapon.
---
14 AP = +1 DPS
---
DPS * weapon speed = damage.
---
Or "nazi"
