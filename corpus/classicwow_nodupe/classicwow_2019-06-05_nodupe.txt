Yes 4% caps you for pvp (there's 1% unavoidable resist chance for spells in pvp).
---
---
---
Yea looks fine.  I tanked 5 mans with a similar spec.  You won't be tanking the BRS's, but its more than enough for a ST/BRD run or even the 60 level 5 mans.
---
Thank you for the help, again.
---
k
---
Yeah dont play a female warlock. The increased menopause is gamebreaking.
---
Menopausal, lmao thanks for the laugh 😂. Guessing that’s supposed to be mana pool
---
Noxious trinket from maraudon. Maybe there were braces as well?  Most of the stuff I used was crafted NR gear from silithus vendor recipes iirc. Legit made you look like level 40 mismatch vest shorts outfit. We bleeding edge raiders yo!
---
You can deal damage without spending talents technically, but no you cannot feral dps in hotw spec.
---
Alright. I see. What about Zul'Farrak that's not a raid? Or is that a 20 man that's before MC?
---
I'd be perfectly fine with the option to see updated graphics, so long as it remains only that: an option.
---
Yeah warriors get their entire toolkit from 30-40 except howl. And some passive damage/healing from cruelty/blood craze/enrage. 
---

---
But no matter how hard people twink, it will still be mostly blue gear so they won’t have the rage wreck too hard. 
---
In group pvp tho.......pendulum of doom with a pocket healer for either windfury or freedom. Big yikes.
---
Which happens every time at the most inexplicable and randomly most important times ALWAYS... haha
---
Patience is a virtue, losing a lv 60 character where you spent hours and hours is not funny at all.
---
I'd rather wait for the final release.

True
---
I have one too! 
---
My moms friend gave it to me when I first started out, and it was opened, so I'm not sure if the in game item has been claimed or not. But he also gave me is account (which I no longer have access to).
---
My money would still be on an UD spriest. 40% physical damage reduction and healing and shields with constant damage is really tough.
---
you are correct. intellect is a very low-priority stat compared to spell power.
---
come join us in the [Classic Warlock Discord](https://discord.gg/enxYw3) if you have other questions :)
---
Wouldn’t play it if I was. Don’t want to waste all that hard work. I had 2 60s in vanilla and a bunch of alts and can remember the zones I preferred back then.
---
Blizzard is not in a good state, they've been doing poorly for a while now and there is constantly news about more people being let go. They need classic to be a success because the company is bleeding. I'll appreciate them when they prove that they're worth it and turn the ship around.
---
Yeah sorry by with  meant "plus"
---
Running a company is different from just being a developer.  Fucking manchild
---
we are maintaining [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=0) and highlighting the fixed issues in green as we test them.
---
\*Laughs in Mind Control\*
---
female orcs had pretty solid models and animations. I think the voice just wasn't very popular.
---
That /laugh and /cry tho
---
Yeah warriors will wreck bgs. They were already super powerful at 30 with no MS, pummel or WW lol.
---
Level to 60 Asap with a character I want to raid with, then start an alt for casual leveling
---
ZF is a level 40ish dungeon.  Zil’Garub is the 20 man raid.  It technically releases between BWL and AQ.  The gear is kind of a mixed bag in terms of quality / power.  Typically around MC levels, but a few pieces are stronger.  If you get unlucky with drops in the 40 man raids, the gear in ZG can be a good upgrade.
---
hm yeah, I feel like they should at least add SOMETHING as a barrier to being able to do it once every what, like 15 days?
---
It is annihilator!
---
Blizzard needs to make some epic single player warcraft game like elder scrolls.
---
Ide pee
---
Yep. It blows. I just leveled a hunter on a pserver and getting groups was like winning the lottery
---
Hard? You can just sap him and loot
---
This
---
"Ughhh I hate mud huts and horde cities"
---
&gt;Every Alliance player ever
---
Don't mind if I just move in to this nice lakeside town then.
---
I'm playing Warlock because it is the less popular Mage.
---
Me and my friend are planning mining/(dis)enchanting and herbalism/tailoring for leveling. And the moment I get my truefaith vestments I'll dump tailoring and pick up either alchemy or enchanting if my friend decides to go for engineering at 60. We are tank/healer combo and we will do the rep and profession grinds together
---
If the level cap is 60, I'm going straight for 60. I'm not going to purposely stay behind the curve if other people are moving ahead. That's why an optional server that has everyone committing to staying at lower level caps temporarily is the solution.
---
Westfall is considered bad.
---
I am pretty sure they tagged mobs, its just that they would open with growl and not do damage for a second because of it. If you really wanted to fight over mobs you could use a winged serpent with its ranged lightning breath.
---
I hated that the male Tauren body shape went from "tall rectangle" to "wide rectangle".
---
Made them feel like they went from tall muscular to dumpy oaf.
---
At what point do these changes stop though? After this, people would ask for HD models that we have in BFA, then people will ask for post naxx content and so forth. I understand the toggle option, but the whole point of this project is to recreate an authentic vanilla experience, I think just updating the enviromental textures as we have now is more than enough to appeal to more players.
---
hope they don't raise it any more, doesn't help the game having streamers be able to do everything
---
Waaaaah da mean Asmongold said he like Mark Kern while watching video where other guy say he like Mark Kern!  Me no like streamer!  Streamer always wrong!  Me angry!  Me post on reddit now!
---
this game is full of spergs, nice rose tinted glasses
---
Poison quest is easy at lvl 20 alone. You stealth in, pickpocket for key, sap the guy at the chest and loot the chest. Maybe spec 5 points in master of deception, but don't think you even need that.
---
You hear people say alliance warlocks are at a disadvantage because of wotf all the time. What you don't hear as often is how alliance rogues are even more fucked by hardiness. Hardiness has no cool down, you could technically immune both cheap shot and kidney shot, making a match up that would have been really difficult, heavily in your favor. The stun resist passive is just crazy. Also remember that your PvP trinket dispels fear, but it doesn't do anything to stuns for a warlock.
---
ty so much!
---
Profs all depend on what you want from them
---
Leveling is okay but very weapon dependant.
---
World pvp is a blast
---
I’d be crushed to get ingame only to lose beta
---
Sorry OP
---
Let’s hope you get it
---
Not getting invited into groups and fighting with literal  everyone for every single piece of gear
---
We have mostly people in their late 20s and early to mid 30’s.   Personally? I’m over 30 with a wife and two kids so .. you’re definitely a fit here.  We pretty much cater to casuals to semi hardcore.
---
as a natural born texan, i can confirm that's not what guns sound like
---
Did blizzard bring out tbc to fast?
---
From stories I’ve heard it sounds like for the majority of players Vanilla still had years of playable content left for everyone, and everyone’s adventure was cut short when tbc came out.
---
It doesn’t really sound fair to me that just because a few hardcore guilds cleared the game that they should rush out more content.
---
I hope they take a different approach with classic and give everyone as much time as they want to play and progress through the game
---
Stamina is the focus for leveling warlock imo. Any Stam/Int gear is your friend
---
All I can see is 
---
Miss
---
Dagger skill increased to 4
---
Dagger skill increased to 5
---
My heart.
---
Aha. So that's how it ties together. Well well.
---
That's a weird way to say "I'm a short-sighted asshole"
---
Elwynn definitely is more satisfying, but personally I prefer the Night Elf zone just because I can quickly go to Darkshore which is objectively the best place to quest in on the Alliance side.
---
This is definitely how it worked in vanilla. Manually controlling your pet was always the best in vanilla as the AI did a lot of dumb things.
---
Rogues at 60 are worth the gear battle. I like Skinning / Leatherworking. Obviously if you’re going hardcore PvP, engineering may be a prio. At 60 in good gear a rogue can solo kill and skin Devilsaurs, I’ve paid for epic mounts doing this and I recommend it. Good luck!
---
Nice. But these exploration lvling routes are not that great due to layering being a thing
---
I don't care about blood fury, I know how to micro my pet, and the stun resist racial will make a huge difference in pvp as opposed to a small difference in pve for berserking.
---
Wtf do you mean "wrong think"?
---
lmao, you can tell people's been watching a lot of vanilla youtubers for the spriest and SL warlock picks
---
also pocket healers in the back
---
That's correct, getting rep from pet kills was removed in a patch as well.
---
'individually'
---
I was a much younger kid, but I remember going broke repairing my gear in Un’Goro.
---
I lost my virginity playing pandoria
---
More warriors = more tanks = more dungeons for me to run.
---
Im for it.
---
I'm like 90% sure I'll main tauren druid, I could go either way on whether I main tauren warrior, and I'll be honest I'm pretty on the fence about an orc warlock or hunter.
---
Don't even start me on professions :)
---
I remember switching a pet to defensive mid combat would recall it to your side until you took damage.
---
A mage 😂
---
God bless you for playing a warrior.
---
And what side will you be picking MUAHAHA
---
Are you looking for an argument or genuinely curious?
---
Yes engineering is that op
---
I would say lock most of the time, but a mage can definitely outplay and win vs a lock.
---
In vanilla I used a hunters mark + pet attack macro when farming and manual control for everything else.
---
lock will usually win with respect to match specifics changing.
---
Not entirely. To you object A and object B may look very similar. But to me they look quite different. Our criteria for determining similarity may be different. Maybe to you the silhouette of an object being identical is enough to render the two objects similar, but to me a very slight color change could make the two objects not similar.
---
I was able to get Mizkif to say this when he was trying to find Esfand. Here is the [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/HorribleBillowingTardigradeOptimizePrime) of it
---
to be specific, wep skill doesn't actually reduce the chance of a glancing blows, but reduce the damage reduction they have on them compared to normal hits, from 35% at 0 wep skill to 15% at 305 before capping out around 308. Either way it's still a stupidly good stat.

RESIST AGAIN! RESIST AGAIN!
---
Which ever one has a more skilled pilot.
---
Don't base your class decision off of who wins 1v1, think more like which one has a race I enjoy staring at for hours. Which has class flavor that I prefer. Do you prefer being able to make food and teleport, or make healthstones and summon
---
Usually the worst people are the ones calling the community horrible.
---
Priest actually does really good holy damage. Definitely the best pure healing spec for damage.
---
Can we get a mental illness awareness month? What about Asperger's, how bout transgender month? Why stop there?
---
(Horde takes nessingwarry camp)
---
WE HAVE TAKEN ALPHA
---
Do you really need to see all of this? I usually just hide everything without a cooldown so there's less screen clutter. Also usually after a while of playing everything becomes second nature to you so you don't even really need to look at any of the abilities at all.
---
you're stretching :p its good tho, keeps u limber.
---
Less than 5% of blizzard is responsible for classic wow.
---
I haven’t heard of it happening in the US since the days when Napster was the popular platform to use
---
I suspect the number of good hunters to be very low because a lot of the good players who want to dps will just pick a class that does more dps.
---
Considering it was supposed to be once a month, yea. Mine was also removed, I assume it'll be back for the June test.
---
"Yet" there's never been a zepp from TB to UC lol
---
Demo warlock with fel puppy out is very tough for a mage - they get 60 resist to everything. If the warlock is geared/smart/engineering they’re not going to lose.
---
See my past post; obviously it’s impossible for them to get EVERY 04/05 account in beta. 
---
The pure fact is they are solely FAVORING them over any account created from 2006 and after. Just because someone from dec 2004 didn’t get in doesn’t invalidate my point. You will not find one comment of a person with a 2008 account who made it into beta. (Stress test, sure, even my 2008 account did)
---
Expertise only buffs swords, daggers and fist weapons. Mace specialisation buffs mace skill.
---
Fair to say that if the Mage is Undead, that's going to tip it pretty nicely in the mage's favor, all else being equal?
---
Westfall is a really bad zone. Scarcity of monsters, a lot of high level monsters scattered around to kill you. A lot of running for quests.
---
I mean including connections.
---
To be fair, they failed to emphasize this on day 1 of the opt-in period.
---
I mean, you could always offer offset pieces at a discount.
---
You could do zero sum with an auction.  Feel free to customize - the gist is that an items' cost is redistributed to the other raiders.  I don't think you'd want to go free though, since a healthy amount of shards available is useful to the guild and it would just encourage hoarding and hoping to hit the "free" item rather than spending.
---
You and that healer visiting Ironforge every night were some of my favorite WoW memories.  You guys were unkillable.
---
In the US they usually don't end up prosecuting because as of now an IP address isn't enough evidence. Now if they had a warrant and did a search.. then maybe?
---
Don’t mind me, but I don’t know who these characters are. Mind helping me out a bit? Bottom left is thrall right? Is bottom right Onyxia?
---
There are no changes currently. I am trying to get people’s opinion on what they would like to see.
---
Personally I would like all the current armour and weapons to have models updated like textures and the depth of the armour etc,
---
The armour and weapon models in BFA are the same as they were in vanilla, only the newer armour and weapons added in expansion packs have the better textures and modelling.
---
It’s not about adding content, it’s about making the existing content more visually appearing.
---
&gt; Considering warlocks rely heavily on DOT damage It would appear that spell damage would far out weigh intellect for DPS  
---
  
---
If all you're going to be doing is 5 mans then yes. However, if you're plan is to raid, then you're not going to do it as Affliction. The only warlock in the raid that will have Corruption on a boss is the one that is specc'ed into Nightfall. This is usually a tradeoff because that's almost always the warlock who's specc'ed into improved imp for the tank group because they have to give up on other dps talents. All of the other warlocks are going to be spamming Shadow Bolt. The first three curses on the boss will be Elements, Weakness, and Shadow. If there are more 'locks in the raid (we had four in our group) there MAY be a debuff slot left for Agony.  
---
If you're raiding, don't expect to do anything other than Shadow Bolt spam. Everything else will be dependent on raid comp.
---
thats if they want to tank. Currently in retail tanks are less than 1 in 5 players, id say that tanking dungeons and raids in retail (ive done it) has been easy every since blizz trivialized threat.
---
i feel 1 in 5 warriors may want to tank but its really gonna be 1/10 that do, and 1/24 who do it well
---
Where were the private server pvpers this tournament?

 📋 Guild info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
 📥 Applicants: Anyone can apply, the leveling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

Dwarf the best alliance race.
---
None of those look like WoW.
---
Shut up with your stupid ideas on how to “fix”
---
Classic.
---
So sick of you idiots with your dumb ideas thinking you know what’s best and how to change the game for the better.
---
The people saying “we need more content after naxx” is the stupidest of stupid.
---
Just shut up and leave the game alone, we don’t need extra content when half the player base won’t even make it to naxx for over two years.
---
Vanilla has a never ending fountain of content, just because idiots like you want to zerg to end game and clear everything does not mean the casual noob who hasn’t even cleared mc yet should be penalized and feel pressured to hurry to catch up to new content, let people take years to finish wow thats fine.
---
Tanks do, although I would love to see an ass-parry.
---
God, I hate fucking spammers....  FUck.
---
Not to be a dick but this questions been asked hundreds of times in the last couple months alone and there are tons of GREAT content on YouTube specifically for classic, and rogues. Wayyyyy more info then you'll ever get asking again here.
---
I personally hate the night elf males after the update! My main in wrath was a night elf male hunter, but I had to gender change after the update. That running animation :/
---
See you on there ;)
---
50/50 but mage needs to be much better to have the 50/50. so equal skill warlock is easier to win and needs less gear to do so.
---

The quest reward for killing the murloc at the end of WC.
---
I'm not putting down the sfk shoulders, but they aren't the only option at that level range.
---
What do you mean ?
---
Yeah! Live! Yeah! Win!
---
That is mitigated by only allowing free for offsets and having those offset pieces only go for free if nobody wants to spend points on them. Shards are valuable to a point but you get loaded with them over time since there is stuff nobody wants at all, and stuff everyone has pretty quickly. 
---
I just don't like a system that makes it so painful to get other gear because it ensures that people will pass that gear and have it DE'd rather than risk not being able to buy the main spec item they have their eyes on. And over time people get upset that they feel forced to watch stuff they want DE'd because everyone is focused on the few big pieces that seem to never drop.

Outside of actual gameplay tips, expect that a lot of people will assume that a rogue player is sort of a douche, without mincing words. They're the ultimate ganker, Blind-and-steal-a-chest class. And the Rogue does attract players who want to be douches.
---
With that said, the rogue has a ton of tools, offers competitive-to-best DPS in PVE, is a legendarily great PVP class, and you'll be a welcome member of any party if you demonstrate an ability to communicate, cooperate, and share. Bear in mind, what so many people yearn for from Classic is that sense of community and teamwork. It really goes for any class and any player - but again, the rogue starts off on the wrong foot in some people's minds. If you strive to be a good and friendly player, you'll have an absolute blast playing the rogue, either solo or with others. 
---
TLDR: No one likes the asshole rogue. Everyone loves the awesome rogue. Be the awesome rogue.
---
Found this in an old photobucket account, but my memory is shit and I don't remember ever getting to MC with my mage
---
The fact Hunters have to buy/make ammo, buy/make food for pet happiness, and they actually have a mana bar is going to shock quite a few retail hunters.
---
how would we know if you did somehitng in PTR?
---
as the hype builds and the potential player base grows every day this sub moves a little bit closer... being fine with just a few more changes... 
---
just give me vanilla wow exactly as it was please.
---
You die very easily, so you have to be cautious when pulling mobs. I would generally speaking only start pulling two mobs at a time once I had blade flurry. Before committing talent points into the combat tree, you ought to commit two points into the assassination tree into the remorseless attacks talent. Level up first aid and cooking while leveling, they give you a nice boost (bare minimum level up first aid). 
---
In terms of worldpvp (especially while leveling), I always felt that hunters are the worst IF they get an opener on you. It's pretty much a done deal versus any ranged class if they do get an opener on you. Which is why I either wait for them to pass or commit to an opener on them myself. The risk with committing to an opener of course is that they start hunting you after you have killed them.  Either way, stealth is your best friend in places like STVietnam etc.
---
Vanquisher sword and thrash blade are two swords you generally want to aim for as you are leveling. So that means RFD and Maraudon should be instances to aim for. You can also get a sword called Sword of Serenity or something like that from a Scarlet Monastery quest. ZF has a nice slow mainhand mace as well if you are interested in that. You also might want to run ST, for you get a rogue-only quest from Ravenholdt. Some pretty sweet rewards in that quest (mainly the headpiece). You can also get some nice mh swords from ST if you are lucky. Another instance you probably should aim for is Uldaman. That is purely from a xp viewpoint, as you get shitloads of xp from that instance. Of course it is up to you how many instances you want to do, but the once I mentioned offer you something quite nice. 
---
I think professions will come down to your own preference and/or that of your guild if you have one. First aid is a must either way. 
---
Once you are 60, getting preraid bis will be challenging. Items like truestrike shoulders for instance are wanted by warriors and hunters as well. Your best bet is to be in a guild where you can run premades.
---
Those are some things that popped to my head
---
K1rage made me lul
---
Yeah 16-18 back in loch, then redridge to 20
---
You’re crazy to think classic isn’t a way to make blizzard more money, lowering the sub cost means they lose money.
---
There is no such thing as an affliction warlock. Raid bosses have 16 debuf slots. So Warlocks dont even use Agony or Immolate as it takes up slots. Your main rotation is Curse of Elements, keep corruption up if you are specced into night fall and shadow bolt spam.
---
autistic fuck, kys, or I hope you get cancer
---
Reasonable? The average age of players is 30-50 for classic, $15 a month is like .5-1hour of work for a month of enjoyment.
---
Also the game was $15 by itself in 2004, with inflation it’s now probably equal to $10...and you get 2 games! We have bigger fish to fry with blizzard my man
---
classic stream blew up on twitch and now this subs demographic has shifted more to retail players and people who started in wrath. sad that the crowd actually responsible for recognizing what a gem vanilla was and getting it brought back is now being shouted down by the masses.
---
At least they admit it. &lt;3
---
The gong will be rang as soon as streamers get handed the stuff from their followers
---
15$ now is alot cheaper than when it was back in 2004         
---
Blizz could make so much more with different business models for wow imo.
---
Still no binding from Garr?
---
ive never thought to bound scroll......
---
If you're leveling affliction, I'd say spirit is your focus. Imp Drain Soul is pretty mediocre baseline, but once you start stacking spirit its nuts. Gear as much stem as you need to survive any given pvp encounter, rest spirit, int as 3rd for leveling aff.
---
I’ll probably be one of those no-names voting warrior on the polls.
---
If a warlock loses a duel they’re trolling
---
Stomping noobs in pvp is never finished
---
Show us on the doll where the clock touched you
---
Nematoads, I was a troll hunter.
---
I see no reason whatsoever that they can't just implement a toggle for vanilla models and modern models. If it's client-side, it has no downsides.
---
I wonder if they'll gradually increase the cap to 60 or just give them instant 60s. I want to see end game stuff tested.
---
not everything can be handed over.
---
I like how it seems blizz considered that many years ago.
---
Unless you dont mean hand literally and more so that the streamer will get the group of players needed.
---
However that is what guilds will be doing.
---
It’s opportunity cost. I could go watch some soccer or other sports, or go to the bar, or go on a hike, or spend too many hours maxing out a toon that is obsolete in a few weeks.
---
I’ll save the no-lifing for late August when it’s AIDS outside.
---
No way, I have it somewhere. Last i looked it was a hundred and I didn’t want to bother.
---
go back to r/wow and play retail please. We just want to play vanilla wow.
---
Started watching but noticed it wasn’t a dwarf so tuned out.
---
Joking I just want to learn hunter first hand, but thanks for all the work to put these together!
---
I’ve never been a big fan of that talent, I’m a stamina kind of warlock. I don’t think that the spirit stacking is necessarily better than stam build.
---
nope.
---
$15 back in 2004 is more expensive now, so, if anything, we're getting it for cheaper. plus, $15 doesn't just get you Classic: it also gets you all of the current, retail version of World of Wacraft's content, which, is quite a lot, even if you have no interest in it.
---
Not saying anything not vanilla sucks. Just saying I want to play Vanilla. I loved the game as it was and I don’t want to see it butchered again.
---
I think we are lucky its only $15 and already included if you have a retail one
---
blizz could of totally sold this as a stand alone 60$ purchase like halo is doing whenever they have a master/hd version come out
---
WSG is OK for little girls, and AV for old ladies.  But AB is a **man's** BG, I tell you what.
---
They went through your stuff because of a single music file? That's pretty fucking nuts. Here nobody gives a fuck, we are too poor anyways. Imagine getting raided for downloading stuff when the average Joe makes about 700€/600€ a month.
---
Can you clarify what you mean by ST?
---
stop bitching and go play pservers.
---
I don't know, that's why i'm asking. I don't remember this happening. Specifically, I don't remember having 4 of those bags or that staff, so I figured someone here might recognize it as a PTR toon or something
---
$15 a month is probably the cheapest expense you have, I don’t mean to be rude, but if your online now posting from your phone/computer you can afford the $15 a month.
---
Shit there are idiots at my work with Netflix, Stan, Hulu, Spotify and a bunch of other subscriptions for crap they never use.
---
 At least with wow Ill get my times worth 100x over.
---
Leveling a rogue is second hardest after warrior. You are very gear dependent and need to make sure the mobs are lower level or you will get shit on. 
---
PVP is fun but any group PVP you will get picked off. 
---
VERY high skill cap and you need to be good to be able to beat crappy players. Crappy rogues are just that, crappy.
---
Raids you are good DPS but warrior (especially horde because on windfurry) shits all over you with half decent gear. 
---
You have little CC and utility in dungeons. It is a fun class to have but in Vanilla literally everyone had an ALT rogue ......
---
I have a special place in my heart for dwarves, their heads look the best on a spike. :P
---
Sunken Temple!
---
Is your name trollgodx by any chance?
---
Headcannon theory, they are linking the sub so that they can tell investors that wow subs are up xyz% which sounds good on the quarterly report, it's also a logical way to cross promote both games by giving retail players access to classic and vice versa, honestly to me it looks like the smartest business move, pleasing investors and cross promotion all in the same move.
---
$15 a month isn't much unless you live in a country with economic problems, add on top that it's stayed at the same price point even through inflation and you're technically getting classic for cheaper than it was 15 years ago.
---
Please go back to r/wow and stop posting your opinions here.
---
You can't heal in Shadowform either. You either have 15% damage reduction (not 40%?), or you can heal. But you can't heal while you have a 1s attack speed pet that's immune to fear and going ham on your ass.
---
No. It's a bargain.
---
I mean, damn. Nearly every game today tries to nickle and dime people and it regularly works, people are out there buying 'deluxe editions', day 1 DLC, cosmetic skins and freemium currencies.
---
$15 a MONTH is NOTHING!
---
Oh it’s on...:)
---
They will make money because people will sub.
---
They could go the other way and charge $20/ month for ONLY classic and many people would still play.
---
1 month wow! My friend is a nerd when it comes to dungeon crawlers and I can’t stand them to save my life. I play maybe 2 hours until I’m burned out with it.
---
There are hundred of YouTube videos on this kind of stuff, just FYI.
---
Yeah that’s what I meant, in my opinion it will be streamer and hardcore private server guilds going for the gongs first.
---
9????
---
How to fuck do you reach that??
---
See you in STV
---
I didn’t lose my virginity to a girl from WoW, but I did meet up with someone I played with and we banged. Also that weekend my guild cleared Nefarion for the first time (I played on her computer) and her guild cleared Ragnaros for the first time right after I stopped playing.
---
All in all not a bad time.
---
You think someone in 2019 is playing with this resolution?
---
This. Warriors see the biggest upgrades from 30-40.
---
but you still have the whole war effort, so it cant just be by the will of 1 guild
---
Warriors are going to fucking smash rogues at 40
---
Bit of plate, MS and whirlwind? Oof
---
First set a goal to play it for longer than a month or two, from there then worry about bis :)
---
and a raptor mount
---
Layering doesn't affect competition for mobs and quest objects, and so doesn'taffect the viability of exploration levelling. Each layer already holds a full realm's worth of players. It's designed to get rid of login queues at launch, and overpopulate realms to keep them alive when/if the population drops due to large numbers of "tourists" quitting the game.
---
I need one...every week...plz.
---
It's the worst class when it comes to leveling, together with paladins, enjoy.
---
I was down on it too for the longest time, then on one lock I was leveling Emberstone refused to drop for me but I somehow ended up with a Corsair's shirt, so I figured I'd wear that, Staff of Westfall, pick up some spirit greens on the AH and see what happened. Totally changed my view of the talent. Only down side is I went from the chill warlock that would let the healers take all the spirit cloth to rolling on all that good stuff.
---
$15 a month adds up, in 2004 it was understandable, that was the common pay model. it was a new game. But subscription models are designed so that devs have constant money coming in to provide updates relatively fast with good quality. Classics not getting any of that. it seems really out of place. theres so much hype around the game from new players. I just cant see a classic only sub or other pay model being anything other than a boon for Blizz in the long run
---
But then you get them throwback laughs.
---
And you won't be either.
---
No.
---
Razor naga. The way mine is set up, it's actually easier to hit 9 than 8.
---
Look at it from a business perspective. BFA isn’t doing so great, how do we prop up the numbers? Give the community what it’s been asking for, Classic, now tie that to the retail sub and it will prop the retail numbers up so the shareholders think we’re actually making them money. 
---
All these posts fail to see you get Classic for a flat $15, no buying the game prior. Unlike original Classic where you had to buy the actual disks. Which if my memory is correct we’re around $50 (Not 100% sure on the cost), and then $15 a month and subscription. 
---
Don’t want retail fine, create a new Battlenet account and set up a subscription to the base game. No need to deal with retail. Either way Blizzard is going to use this to prop up BFA.
---
it’s the most played class in vanilla?
---
What if there's two lego figures. One is legolas and the other is john wick. Somebody could argue that the two figures are similar because they have the same silhouette, are both yellow, both have the little peg thing on their head. Somebody else could argue that they are dissimilar because although they are both lego figures, one has pointy ears and a quiver on his back and wears green whereas the other one looks like keanu reeves. 
---
Who is wrong in this situation? I would say they are both correct. I think there's room for someone to argue either way on whether or not the remodels are similar or not to the classic versions, and therefore it is not objective.
---
You can try leveling with this spec http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hx0hZV0cZx0ez to lvl 39 and reskill then to the 30/0/21 endgame spec. At lvl 39 you have the 1s cast reduction for your lightning bolt which makes it a lot easier. Also youre going for int all the time to get less downtime.
---
People will pay for Nostalgia, they should charge more and milk this re released game
---
I would pay 100/month so no.
---
15 then is 30% more than 15 now
---
$15 is more than reasonable
---
Affli lock what? such a thing doesn't exist in vanilla.
---
The double trapping guide was neat. Thanks!
---
You won’t see me until it’s too late
---
I don't play AAA games, I mostly play EQ tlps. You have no context of what that xp boost means. Omg he got a potion (that everyone gets for free btw) that let him hit max level in 30 hours instead of 23.5 hours!
---
Only 1 game there.
---
This is false, of course it affects competition for mobs, this is exactly why it was implemented. To ease congestion while levelling.
---
You’re a special kind of stupid, then
---
I’ve tried it, main’d warlock for like 13 years, and lvled multiple locks on pservers over the years.. maybe i don’t like it because I pvp often while lvling, I like the survivability
---
I see. makes absolutely no sense, but thanks blizz. 
---
I did buy those a long time ago thinking they are accountwide but ofcourse not. Its not like it said anywhere, they were toys and pretty much all toys are accountwide.
---
QQ!
---
Not at all. Classic offers so much content and gameplay that spending the $15 a month to throw my life away will be saving me money.
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
WHY IS NOBODY AT FARM?!
---
Stupid scrubs lern2pvp and git on my level.
---
Grats you got the joke
---
Anyone know a decent UK based website where I could get one of these printed on canvas?
---
A full layers population in 6 starting zones.
---
Equal gear/skill lock as 99% chances of winning
---
lol...
---
Are people gonna buy it?
---
Yup.
---
This gave me great inspiration for my binds. I was planning on using mostly mouse side buttons with modifiers, but couldnt think of a good visual layout to remember/learn them. Ill probably use an adaptation of yours now, ty!
---
Will probably add Q and E to the modifiers to have a total of 60 binds with just my mouse and modifiers, keeping stuff stuff like f, g, t, z, x, c and v for non ability binds, 1-6 buttons for class specific stuff and macros for farming and grinding(eg stealth and pickpocket stuff) and the F1-12 for any niche stuff that might be left.
---
The age of a game has never mattered, only those who are shallow care about graphics, which is the only thing that gets "better" 
---
Some of the better elder scrolls are considered to of came before skyrim.
---
Dwarf Fortress has been around forever and is better than 90% of shit today
---
Sharding being in has killed all hype I had for it unfortunately.
---
You are blatantly wrong here. Each layer holds a full realm's worth of players anyway. The only way this could be considered to "ease congestion" is if were expecting megaservers with populations far exceeding the original server population caps.
---
but even still today for mythics at least two people must go to the dungeon in order to summon.
---
What's wrong with them?
---
for mythic dungeons right now there is no flying and two people must make their way to the dungeon entrance to summon.
---
You going to be playing an over populated class competing with fury warriors who can use that gear better and hunters that demand everything.
---
Not getting at least 2/5 or 3/5 Imp Corruption is rough and having 0/5 Suppression is pretty bad. BUT with stam stacking you have Fel Dom, improved voidwalker, and insane damage reduction. If you go affliction you're just gonna get rolled by warriors who now have Berserker Rage
---
Hopefully all that means is servers will be huge enough at launch that they can still be pretty full when tourists quit. Beyond that, if there isn’t an RPPvP I’ll be quite sad
---
GF? 
---
On Reddit? 
---
Playing WoW? 
---
Bullshit!!!!
---
all of the big streamers are alliance side, namely asmongold, he loves dragging shit out in the hopes of causing hype and then never doing it.
---
Get on a private server and practice your leveling route like the true neckbeards do.
---
God bless
---
In Classic leveling is part of the game unlike right now where leveling is more of an obstacle. 
---
Classic is all about the journey and not the destination. You will die a lot ..... and you will run a lot. You will need patience as even doing a dungeon requires not only putting a group together but actually physically running to the said dungeon and getting into it as almost every dungeon has a ton of elites way before the actual entrance. 
---
Gold ...... you will be poor, very poor, to the point you will not be able to buy all your skills let alone a mount at level 40. Level 60 mount is an achievement not everyone obtains. There are no dailies for easy gold. 
---
You only have one spec and respeccing costs a lot even for a level 60.
---
Again the game focuses on the community and working with others around you.
---
Ancient Petrified Leaf was added in 1.4, about 5 months after Maraudon and 1 month after Dire Maul. It could be in phase 1 or 2. Phase 2 would match up closer to retail, but it sounds to me like they are not screwing around with loot tables other than the big revamp in phase 5 so my guess is on it being available in phase 1.
---
It’s not a clip of some douche streamer so, upvotes galore!
---
Which one is more viable in group PvP? Do warlocks just get dogpiled and die while mages can potentially 1v3 some classes in PvP?
---
What are you actually on about? Blizzard took action against the individual.
---
&gt;Did he break the legal ToS by definition? No.
---
Yes he did see above.
---
&gt;Falls under the definition of griefing
---
That definition is left up to the sole discretion of Blizzard. 
---
You are really making a fool of yourself. You have been consistently wrong.
---
&gt;Lawyered 
---
You have to be joking right? Nobody is this big of a clown, are they? 
---
What a joke.
---
I wish I could only pay $15 but instead we use the Blizzard pricing where $=€.
---
&gt;I guess everyone has their own opinion
---
Right so, don't go around ridiculing peoples'. That's basically TL;DR of my post.
---
Blizzard has clearly laid out a very long term content plan so that no one can rush to farm the full end game content, that other guy was just saying it might be neat if the leveling speed was also kept in check to avoid that being a rush-down thing too. You made it sound like it's a totally unreasonable idea, when it's really not much different than the gating Blizz is already doing.
---
I’ve ran a company...
---
Does it really matter anyways when you run it into the ground and get voted off your own board?
---
$15 in 2004 is worth $20.45 in today's dollars.
---
So why would Blizzard say they are using this method to ease congestion??? Also I don't think you know what the word blatantly means.
---
Go check yours! I found some great BC content.
---
They wreck ppl in duels.
---
Thats good to hear, because I enjoy making them.
---
Hope it stays in or is toggle-able.  But also clicking it brings up the alarm and stopwatch currently in beta.  Which is nice to have.
---
Sweet a guild of close friends using loot council
---
Yup, bag space is going to be at a premium for some time, especially for hunters and warlocks
---
Prepare to be downvoted viciously and for people to not engage in discussion. 
---
I try to raise this question as well, and ran some numbers regarding how much $$ Blizz has already made from this game, combined with the fact that many of us already bought the game and now have to.. buy it again?  They kind of get around that by saying it's just a free service if you sub to WoW. 
---
ActiBlizz has made at least $10 billion gross revenue from this game using VERY conservative numbers, and Classic has no serious ongoing expenses in terms of development.  There is surely a lot of up-front development to make it work, so some sort of cost is acceptable.  But $180/year is nuts.  
---
To me it seems an obvious cash grab- there is huge hype around classic and they want to get money from it.  But in some ways, the $15 sub might kill the game for a lot of people.  It's abundantly available on private servers- and while they "aren't perfect" they are pretty damn close to the original experience.  I'm sure Blizz will go after them to eliminate whatever competition is possible.  But how many of those pserver players will actually PLAY classic?  Surely not at 15/month.  They probably will just wander off to other games and that is sad. 
---
They should just have a 'lower tier' offering for Classic only.  One-time purchase from the Blizz launcher, or maybe a yearly, cheaper sub like $50/year or something.  But $15/month prices Classic at the very top of the market as far as costs and is not really reasonable.  
---
I love this sub but it's not a good place to get an objective discussion about this.  People are too hyped, and sometimes I suspect that there is some gatekeeping and epeen flexing, because shouting "LOL U SO POOR Y NOT U PAY $15?!" is depressingly easy to do.
---
hyped asf
---
Great vids. I'm still thinking about maining a hunter in classic and I'm very rusty on how their play style was back then so this is helpful!
---
If you can afford it dont play it - dont let the door hit you on the way out. Ta ta ta
---
How fast gates will open depends on each server individually. The quest chain can be done in 2 ID's. Every guild that cares about a mount will have one. If the gates are open getting from skeram to C'thun can be done in less than an hour if you skip bug trio, Viscidus and Ouro
---
That's not his argument though.  The model for having Subscription costs in general supports ongoing development which there is none.
---
I was worried that OP would be yet another such person based on the title.
---
Eh, 15 year sub doesn't necessarily mean you're a good tester
---
The overall 40’s are free. Go to ratchet, talk to a guy, done.
---
Very strange that it persisted for that long. It’s worth noting I am on F&amp;F - not sure where I sit on the list though.
---
It feels like this is just to get people to sub two weeks early. It's kinda bullshit.
---
I'm sorry, I don't like it. I'd be okay with toggle for remastered vanilla only, but not animations/models from retail.
---
Thank you!
---
I know it's pretty low-fi but I wanted to provide some visuals to things you might read in guides but aren't explained in game.
---
Best of luck!
---
Upgrade?
---
A new one that can run WoW like a dream is not terribly expensive.
---
Cmon man.  $180/year mandatory to play the game is very different than opting into the type of transactions that you describe.   Tons of AAA games offer a fair up front price and compelling gameplay without all these crazy things you mention.
---
I mained a gnome warrior in vanilla - I only ever saw one other lvl 60 gnome warrior on the server with any regularity.  Always surprised me because of the great racial and they look fucking awesome in armor sets imo.  Helms a little wonky and looks fucked if you have a beard though.
---
Cthun (and every other boss) will be killed almost immediately by private server guilds who have been practicing for years.
---
The thing is, while content will be cleared fast, it will be a tiny elite minority doing the clearing.
---
The majority of the playerbase will not even be close to a cthun kill before the 1% gets theirs.
---
In regards to how quickly content gets cleared, I think we should measure it by how long it took for a certain % of players to clear a raid, not how long it took for the one no lifer guild to get their clear.
---
Eg. you might find 1% of players clear naxx the first day, but 6 months later only 25% of players have done a full naxx clear.
---
(I also believe players that rush ahead should not be rewarded with more content sooner, I hate the idea of classic+ and I think every player should be allowed to take all the time in the world to clear the game at their own pace)
---
Like this one - Maybe at the top right, have a requires section, similar to how classic DB does. I know there's an area at the bottom for "related" but can be simpler.

Get hit rating, AND STOP BEING A CRIT PERCENTAGE WHOOOOORE
---
But we know EXACTLY what needs to be turned in for the war effort, unlike when it launched. People will be saving stuff for it well in advance to be prepared for it.
---
This is the answer.  It may not be reasonable on Blizz's part to charge this much but they *will* because they *can*.  Classic has huge hype and lots of people will sign up. 
---
However, I think the community will shrink quite a bit after 6 months/ 12 months and then there will be a VERY small influx of new players.  Any community needs new people coming in to keep it fresh, relevant, and interesting.  The $180/year price point will turn a lot of potential players off.
---
Glad to help, if we see each other game I want to see some sick trap plays
---
If it's a standalone purchase without a sub cost it is WAY cheaper than $15/month.  Don't delude yourself into thinking that $15/month is somehow cheaper than $60/one time.
---
It feels good to be good to real people. I think that's one of the best things about humans. As much as our modern society glorifies lawyers and politicians and celebrities as real people and can make it seem like their behavior is default, beneath that slimy exterior the majority of us like to offer their wisdom, insights, and expertise to people in their community. 
---
You can see how Blizzard bought in to the "appeal to the greedy and selfish people" mentality with their modern design. I've never really felt like that was true. My neighbors are all good fun to talk to. Recently I borrowed a lawn mower after returning from a long vacation to a jungle lawn and a broken mower and, from behind me, I heard "Don't worry about walking on the grass!" 
---
Just those little, human, nice things. That's what most people are like to fellows in their community. That's what the WoW community used to be like because there WAS a community. It'll be mostly like that.
---
Why is there a man in the corner of your game though? I’m confused
---
I don't understand why those who question the pricing of this receive such vitriol.  You are bringing up the negative attitude, not OP.
---
So not a 50/50 then. Honestly it is probably closer to 30/70 with equal skill. If the warlock starts with fel pup and a spell stone on, you're kinda hooped as a mage.
---
undead warrior isnt that rare... Laintime and Klinda were undead warriors, they surely influenced alot of people to play ud's. (also cannibalize is amazing for warriors)  
---
But undead FEMALE warrior, now thats another thing entirely... i dont recall ever seeing one.
---
Not only that, but generally bad rewards. If you quest through westfall as a mail wearer for example, you get boots, a belt, and a shield if you want one.
---
If you quest through darkshore.... you get a chest, bracers, gloves, boots, legs, and a belt., along with a 6 slot bag instead of a 4 slot bag, 2 different cloaks (stamina or spirit), whereas westfall requires you to forfiet the mail boots if you want anything and it's an agility cloak. The rewards are not even remotely comparable. 
---
And if you were a wand class back before everyone figured out how easy lesser magic wand was to craft, darkshore gave you 3 wands instead of 1, and the first one much earlier than the coastal menace quest in westfall which requires you to kill a level 20 mob.
---
Blizzard is greedy company. They never make price lower. They sell even too old games like Warcraft 1,2 and Diablo 1 for modern's games price.
---
Blizzard drained me for $15 a month for a couple of years, then I sold my character and it about evened out. The market for Classic characters will also be very lucrative due to the enormous amount of time it takes to fully gear. Food for thought :p
---
It made you almost entirely dependent on other people.  If you had simply been shadow spec you would have been able to solo at a decent rate and still heal well enough for lowbie instances.

A few of us have played together since Vanilla.  Some played Destiny 2 together.  We enjoy raiding, BG's, Dungeons, and leveling.  This guild will experience end game content, but we won't be pursuing world firsts or Rank 14 for members.  Most of us have kids, families, and demanding careers.  Our primary concerns are community and teaching.  We are looking for people that are like minded.  We may not have as much time now as we did in our college days, but we enjoy being productive, efficient guild mates.  
---
We're comprised of members from a lot of different backgrounds.  I'm a critical care nurse.  We have several people that work in tech, but we all share a common love for gaming and helping our guild-mates.
---
I have a fair amount of guild leadership experience.  I managed a guild of about 300 during BC.  My leadership philosophy revolves around being respectful of people's time.  
---
**Expectations:**
---
* Have a good attitude.  Toxic players will not be tolerated.  That being said, we rip on each other frequently - but it always comes from a light-hearted place. 
---
* Participate in our discord community.
---
* Come to each other's aid (I can't wait for world PvP again)!
---
* Help each other with crafting skills.  
---
* If you want to raid, come prepared.  Buffs are extremely important in Classic and as stated earlier our time is valuable.  
---
* Represent our guild well in PuG's.  Server reputation is so important in Classic.  We're going to strive to be the gold standard of an ally.  
---
If our community sounds like a good fit for you, or if you just want to chat with like minded people that are excited to experience Classic WoW again join our discord!

It's going to be tough to 1v3 people on a mage. Maybe some low geared rogues and warriors sure.
---
Warlock can just completely trash some classes. Like druid has zero chance vs warlock but actually does very good vs mage.
---
Not OP, but personally I don't see the $15/month is too much argument as saying "I can't afford it".  Of course you can afford it.  And if you can't then that is too bad, but you probably should get priorities in order =P
---
You can criticize something as being overpriced and that doesn't make you a poor person.
---
No, the servers should be small enough to maintain themselves without sharding. 
---
It defeats the entire purpose of vanilla if there's no permanent community because you're on a different server when you log on.
---
People will pay 15 bucks for a skin. 15 a month is only 50 cents a day even if you're young and broke get creative and you can pay for it.

i still have my thieves tools even in retail :p how could you sell those bro?
---
Yeah they scuffed the update but pretty sure it's fixed
---
But all those issues apply to every class, not just warrior. Sure, warrior might be a bit harder to level than other classes, but if you don't try every class you don't realize that. 
---
I didn't know that when I leveled my first character, a Night Elf warrior. Still played the game damn near every day all the way through WotLK.
---
Don't cheat and you won't get banned.
---
It's that simple.

Don't think a lot of people know this but you can hover your mouse over the day and night symbol at the top right and it says the time

---
Why did retail turn them into such robotic rides?
---
It's weird that it's only doing that on left-strafe and not right-strafe.
---
I do like that Orcs don't have to be slouched all the time now though.
---
It's still nothing. 50c a day for *up to* 24 hour access. You can also get a discount if you want to buy in bulk.
---
'Cmon' yourself. Those of us who played at the appropriate age now have more expendable income than ever. List your monthly bills and see how little it costs to play. 
---
Bargain.
---
Go back to r/gatekeeping and fuck off please. Anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature knows most Vanilla models look like ass.
---
And the number of items you need to turn in isn't actually that high. A single player can tackle a big chunk of one of the requirements. Pretty sure I did 1/5th of the thorium bars for alliance on my realm.
---
actually it does, retail in included
---
I feel it man, thanks for reading the post at least lol
---
Im really hoping Blizzard will think of the new or returning players who have no intention to play the retail version of the game. Thats alot of money to spend on a game with such a heavy time commitment like Classic. for new players even if they enjoy it i can see them just leaving outright for other more cost effective alternatives
---
Even that mechanic wasn't very damaging. It was the cross realm grouping that killed the community
---
Although ninja looting and depending why you kick people is a sure fire way to get on a shitlist
---
Nope.  Next question?
---
All those pvp videos never have the disclaimer that it requires a dedicated healer following you around every BG.
---
delete this
---
Bro it's a fucking subreddit discussion.  Ridicule is part of the discussion.  You sound like a giant pussy.
---
It will be extremely difficult for Mages to AoE grind at the beginning of Classic, due to how populated all of the leveling zones will be. Even moreso for streamers, because they'll be easily stream sniped due to how vulnerable you are while AoE grinding.
---
AoE grinding is incredibly effective for Mages when done properly but it won't really go full steam until things calm down after launch.
---
They never said anything about easing quest/mob congestion in anything I've read. They mentioned using it to solve the load problems on launch, but that's relating to players otherwise being unable to log-in.
---
They HAVE, on the other hand, explicitly confirmed that each layer has a similar population cap to the original Vanilla WoW servers.
---
(https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8 5:40, can't do fancy links on phone)
---
So yeah. For the first few hours or so on launch day, we may well have many hundreds of players in each starting zone in each layer, until people start to spread out.
---
This keeps coming up over and over again but personally ive never heard in my life that  fury tanks were a thing in raids.... i raided pretty HC from TBC onwards, as warrior, and never did i hear it being used or uttered.  
---
Do you have any videos from the real vanilla of this being a thing?
---
Without a doubt, but blizz didnt and probably wont ban for it now
---
Honestly Im taking this time to play around in ESO and FFXIV since both of their new expacs hit before classic.
---
That seems correct in a way
---
Shaman, dropping a log never felt so good.
---
Also, said log causes so many people problems and if i decide to drop a different log, it can help tons of people.
---
I promise it won't matter as much as you think
---
Play what you really want, or you'll regret it most likely
---
Asmongold and soda are the big streamers. The rest sorta the same so its split between alliance and horde
---
You are what you eat.
---
You have to do something pretty serious to get banned, like grief the same guy for hours a day every day of the week - and even then it's just a temp ban. You'll probably get muted for being toxic in trade chat, but you won't get banned unless you really deserve it (or you screw over a streamer).  
---
The only real way to get proper banned is to
---
1. Proper real toxic shit like death threats, stalking, doxing
---
2. Exploits like items/curreny dupes
---
3. Illegal file client meddling like bots/model swaps etc.
---
Even though I'm working minmum wage If I were to look at just time spent played versus how long it takes me to earn that $15 a month it usually ends up being well worth it imo.

1&amp;2 combat swords

How on earth do you rebind shift+alt to caps lock?  That’s genius!  But how ?!
---

---
You don't deserve the power you have been given...
---
But then you get the private server and the true classic server experience at the same time.
---
It's just slower, just take your time and cherish every upgrade you get.
---
Blizzard might have gotten a bit better at detecting sold accounts to. I for one don't want to pay large ish sums of mony only to have blizzard ban the account.
---
Maybe people will be in for a shock when the pserver "race meta" doesn't work out on classic.
---
Personally I'll be playing a dwarf priest with pigtails so it doesn't really affect me one way or the other.
---
BFA client
---
you vendor everything but heavy leather+
---
The fire elemental burning like a torch in the dark stockades looked so damn good.
---
Feb 22 is my birthday
---
I was turning 10.
---
I'm assuming he meant that you would have to pay for the game and then pay for the sub separately too
---
Autoreport doesn't care though. Enough people reporting = autoban, or does it work differently?
---
On launch day, it looks that way, based off what has been said about the system so far. Until people start moving into other zones, anyway.
---
So it's a while ago since I did this so I don't remember the exact way it's done, but the software I used is called sharpkeys https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys
---
Also I believe it's ctrl + alt that works as a modifer in wow, not sure though. Anyway I was able to keybind caps to do that and then rebound another key on my keyboard to work as caps.
---
Track humans is great for questing and finding mobs to kill if there is a lot of people around killing stuff. It also good for watching out for horse. Eagle eye is good with mixed with mining to find nodes.
---
I would love to have the option of updated models and graphics. I’ve been an advocate on a few similar posts and the argument against the models is silly. Basically some people don’t want you to see updated models on your screen which will have no changes to gameplay. It all comes down to personal preference just like the graphics updates to shadows and water they already have in classic.
---
Well I've also participated in every beta since wrath. Honestly I don't think they even look for "good testers" I think it's pretty much random unless you got viewers.
---
Yeah I doubt they would either tbh. Doesn't seem actionable as a "he kicked me from his group" is pretty like ..okay so?
---
No idea what their system will be. I doubt it will be autoban for this reason
---
This.
---
It’s idiots like op with their “bright ideas” on how to “fix” the game that ruined the game in the first place.
---
Back in the day people used to write highly emotionally charged posts on forums practically trying to guilt trip blizzard into making game change demands because they can’t play while X is in the game or how the game would be so much better if they added Y instead, unfortunately blizzard listened to a lot of these idiot posters instead of sticking to their own vision.
---
You gotta remember, majority of players are in game happily doing there thing and are perfectly fine with how the game was made, it’s the vocal minority on the forums that have a problem and want the game made to suit them that are dangerous to the game.
---
Anyone who asks for changes or extra content should be shot down on site.

L44 or L55?

Mage vs warrior is 50/50, but mage must be 5% HP and AFK.
---
tfw you're intersex and can't have sex
---
Time to buy a 6' rope.
---
Ah, you’re right about that. So 308 Swords and 305 Maces. Thanks for the correction. 
---
I’m still very curious if it is worthwhile to go for the extra two skill points in swords/daggers/fists over another 2% SS damage in the same tier though. With the extra miss added from dual wielding do Rogues wanna go after even more Weapon Skill? Or should they just go for +Hit at a certain threshold? I guess we may not know until we can start collecting the data.
---
Mom, bathroom!!
---
Kek
---
The real treasure was the virginity you kept along the way
---
Possibly yeah, I see where you could think that
---
No I've had it the whole time.
---
I think you can use key tweaks but I didn’t know you could re-bind button combinations like that.  Anyways I have caps re-bound to tab target but if I can figure out how to rebind caps like that I will that’s really smart
---
Fuck yea man I think that’s what I’ll do
---
This hits so close to home.
---
where are these loot list application sheets?
---
Me too but I think Vanilla WoW actually brought it back
---
C'thun is peak vanilla. It's the first time a boss requires all 40 players to be looking at their screens. If you lose 3 people early on, it could legitimately cause a wipe. Sure, the mechanics aren't really that difficult. But you actually need 40 people to understand every mechanic and not make stupid mistakes, or you're not going to kill the boss.   
---
If I had to speculate, I'd say the 'average' raid guild will take several weeks to kill C'thun. And even when they do get it, they'll struggle to do it consistently.
---
well if youre going to generally be a dick to people and do things like ninja loot, then youre going to be blacklisted anyway. people are going to remember who the assholes are and spread the word and nobody will wanna take a chance on grouping with you. but blizzard have said theres going to be some sort of human element to the report system and not be 100% automated
---
You can, but daggers aren't great for sns and hemo.
---
DAE my daughter gets railed???
---
Good shit man thanks for the response
---
Probably not but there will be a reputation addon that is going to be widely used. Might not want to get on the wrong side of that.
---
yeah i would consider track beasts/humanoids/hidden to be the 3 most important while leveling, and maybe undead once you are in your 50's and questing in the plaguelands.
---
Yes you're right.  Coupling it to retail is what is leaving a sour taste with me and OP.  Having literally zero interest in the retail game.  It's an open secret even among the big streamers, I check a few from time to time and they will make fun of retail.
---
Id buy that for a dollar!
---
0:36 I make that same noise when people tell me I can play in August
---
Layering does affect competition for mobs. Competition for mobs will be huge anyway, since layers are huge. You both are sort of right.
---
caused crash on beta ;( your version 3.0 worked great though.
---
There's always /time
---
Cheers mate
---
Well first off I am under the impression from everything I've seen and heard so far regarding this that no action was taken against him.
---
Blizzard has set out a definition and it was listed above. You are under the false assumption that player created events fall under the same protection as actual griefing offenses in the game. Blizzard makes a clear distinction between the two in the ToS. People standing on totems and trying to bug others during duels has always been part of the game and has gotten no one banned before.
---
Ive laid out examples and explained the difference between the two and why one is griefing and the other is not. You've done nothing but say "Your wrong" and call me a clown.
---
 Ive even agreed with those above that it was a dick move but like I said, playing the devil's advocate, according to the rules Blizzard has laid out (and followed through on in the past with situations like this in Vanilla and onward) this player did nothing wrong by the rules of the ToS. This is why it was a divisive subject, people know he didn't break the rules but still wanted him banned anyways, it was a case of Cognitive Dissonance.
---
 He broke social rules and if he was punished was clearly due to the community out lash and not due to the rules itself, maybe this will act as a type of "case law" that will now fall under griefing, as some, you and even myself agree it should.
---
As I said before I was simply playing the devil's advocate while looking at the ToS and past situations I could recall in game from an actual educated legal standpoint.
---
Chill man, no need for Ad Hominem.
---
The people in beta are great. The people on this sub are yikes. I wish it would stay how it is now forever. Fuck you nerds.
---
Honestly at 40?  It’s a tough call I honestly think hunters are going to rule the meta.  With beastial wrath most classes won’t be able to deal.
---
Ennokus, Tauren Warrior. I was MT from vanilla through TBC. I 100% remember your toon.
---
Bindpad, hopefully they can do something like it for classic if they haven't already.
---
omg 😂. i’m gonna blast this for my first ten hours
---
$10 says one or both of them moaned in Japanese
---
So simple but never thought about that
---
imagine being as angry as you are on a daily basis lol i'd love to see a pic of you to see if my mental image is correct.
---
I'm guessing you're middle aged. 40ish, overweight, balding but refuses to let go of what hair remains, patchy &amp; unkempt facial hair that resembles taped on pubes, neckbeard, poor fashion sense, plain white sneakers, unattractive wire frame glasses, teeth probably caked with calcium from poor dental hygiene.
---
You should really see a therapist. Everything you post online stems from misery and apparently frustration at a life wasted playing games
---
Do some research because orgrimar nor undercity have druid trainers, I'm not really sure where they are besides thunderbluff so might be good to double check or else you may be making a lot of trips back across the ocean
---
your interest level is irrelevant
---
I have had 100 of the same interactions lol
---
I think the old ones are still the same. They just added new animations and tied those to lots of spells. Cast directed and omni? look the same but maybe i'm forgetting. Directed was for instant (ie fireblast) and omni for casted spells (fireball).
---
im saying they could of done both
---
I’ll be paying by playing with retail gold and WoW tokens. I have 4 but can get more, when that runs out I will see how the classic WoW gold and Retail exchange rate is because it might be possible to pay to play via classic WoW, I think it will be reasonable with people buying gold in bfa and trading for classic gold. There’s Blizzards cut but I think it will level itself out, I hope it’s made against tos because it’s obviously bad for the game  but I’ll be taking advantage of the gold buyers to play for free if it’s legal.
---
damn
---
6 hour CD won't stop wbuffs. There will be agreements and timers, and there still will be DM/Songflower/ZG.
---
It just opens a room for same-faction griefing.
---
Have 2 accounts, play horde and alliance, gank everyone and blame it on the other faction.
---
Good call, I think I'll fix that
---
Idk man anytime I shit on a horde (pretty often) they just call for their butt buddies, can't handle being outskilled in a 1v1 or 2v2 scenario
---
*/1 we are getting ganked by a gnome mage any 60s in the area that can help?!*
---
just the first ten?
---
you'll need it for 7 weeks 5 days 13 hours and 20 minutes
---
(giving you 3 hours a night to sleep)
---
Because I've been checking my emails and been leveling another toon on retail pretty intently, I figured the email would inform me :(
---
Also I have to ask, what is this new trend of "....../s"
---
I don't get it and Google won't explain it to me.
---
&gt; but using terms like "gatekeeping" is absolutely ludicrous.
---
The guy was saying anyone who complains about ganking should roll on a PvE server instead. Calling that "gatekeeping" is not ridiculous. 
---
As for the racist comparison, I think you're missing my point.
---
Fucking Zoomers with there Yeets and Eskeddits
---
That's actually a big problem with gaming and toxicity at the moment, in my opinion. But that's another topic all together.
---
With inflation we actually paid 18 dollars originally. 
---
Also you're a cheap ass.
---
i was very careful with my wording and said on average.
---
I notice a lot of people getting upset over how quickly top end guilds will do.
---
Yeah someone did the math Ina post the other day and $15 in 2004 was like 33% more than it is today with inflation
---
Depends what you mean by 'other things.'
---
No, you can't be an outright c**t to other people and get away with it. If you want to be an edgelord like on pservers with the god awful, repetitive sexist/racist/xyzphobic jokes, you'll probably get reported and have action taken against you.
---
The other sutff? That's not a reportable offense.
---
Ruh roh
---
Definitely! Especially all the trunks you can find. Greens and expensive mats.
---
what do you mean 2 IDs?
---
Do you mean 2 per MC and BWL?
---
/s means sarcasm
---
It's a wonderful keybind :)
---
You're making an argument by making points that don't relate to what you're trying to assert, though. 
---
$180/year *just to play the base game* is more than 99% of any other games on the market.  Microtransactions/DLC etc are thrown out the window here as they are not relevant to this game. 
---
It's not about not being able to afford the game.  You don't know me and I don't know you, I can afford the game no problem.  It's not a matter of being a poor.  The question is *is it worth it* or also *is it reasonable for Blizz to charge this*. 
---
To be honest I think the game IS worth $15/month.  I love Classic.  But ya know what?  Blizz is pulling a fast one by linking it to retail like this and making people pay full price.  There's no way in hell that it costs them anything remotely close to what they will rake in, and as others have said I feel that they're using this to prop up BFA and make the overall ##s look better to their shareholders.  And I don't really begrudge them that, but I feel that I can call it like I see it. 
---
I made a point elsewhere that I think the $15/month will push away a lot of casual players.  And that hurts the game.  If you don't have a constant stream (or trickle at least) of new players the game will stagnate and get bored.  You need to have casual players checking it out,leveling up, learning how to play, interacting with the community, etc.
---
I want to make an Orc clan based on the Orks of 40k. Hunters with Shootas, warriors with big choppa, sneaky boys, Weirdboys spitting warp magic, and lots of Iron grenades,
---
The only 3 tracking abilities worth picking up are track hidden, humanoid and beast.  The rest aren't so great.
---
Eagle Eye you can pass on but can be useful for checking if camp nessy is hostile.
---
traps other than freezing or frost trap can be skipped. disengage / distracting shot kinda useless tbh unless you're soloing tough elite quests which are entirely optional while leveling anyway.
---
You only need clip wing rank 1. So that's a money save. And Hell even arcane shot is barely worth it.
---
Scorpid sting is pretty much useless compared to viper or serpent
---
You only really need scare beast rank 1 while leveling. Rank 1 is fine pve, and rank 2 is only helpful against pvp hunter pets and druids, which rank 1 will still do just fine.
---
Mongoose bite is garbage and can be skipped entirely if you feel the need. it does static damage not based on your melee AP or weapon, so its pretty bad.
---
Dont need aspect of the wild at all, unless you really love orange side maraudon.  
---
Volley is good in world pvp when there are like 30 people to hit.  Can be useful -- but its optional imo.
---
Yeah, the rest I would grab.
---
Most of them.
---
All you really need is your pet: Send him in, scatter shot, and then feign death.

i hope this is the case, call me crazy but id like a challenge.
---
Hmm.. shadow rogue *looks off into the distance*.
---
If you're not playing Classic because $15 is too much for you than you clearly have bigger issues to worry about than playing a video game. 
---
Also you mention "$15 isn't the same as it was in 2004", ummm you realize due to inflation a WoW sub today is more expensive than it was in 2004...
---
You have a YouTube link to the music ?
---
Lmao yes
---
So on Reddit, you're just reading text and you don't know for sure whether someone is joking
---
Lately with the growth of this sub in particular, people have been more on edge, ready to jump straight to an argument or personal attacks rather than a discussion or a "maybe this is facetious" , so  anytime I'm kidding  recently I just add /s so there's no way to misinterpret it.
---
It takes away from the comedic value of basically anything, like saying " HEY DID U GET MY JOKE ? DID YOU LIKE IT? DID U GET IT?" 
---
But it's better than getting angry replies for an hour from someone who took my joke personally
---
The only thing I dislike about the new Dwarves is their run animation. It feels like I'm hopping whenever I run and its really off-putting.
---
I also miss the "crazed Soulstone face" Dwarves had, but I understand why that one went away.
---
Yikes yeah that would have been even worse =P
---
I've made my feelings known elsewhere, I'm just concerned that pricing it so high will turn off a lot of potential casual players which definitely hurts the community and player base.  Without new people coming in it'll get stale very quick.  I think even the most tryhard or intense Classic aficianado recognizes the need for a vibrant, active playerbase.
---
Warrior. Using my own strength instead of magic.
---
Sword and Shield, to protect allies.
---
Being the first one into battle and everyone depending on you.
---
You know, that old chestnut.
---
The idea is that new players will shy away from the pricing, and returning vets could just move onto other games once they get a month or 2 in to get their fix. Player retention is vital for this kind of launch and introducing a pay model designed around content updates that the game isnt even getting can put a bad taste in many players mouths. 
---
People of many ages and financial situations want to play. the Amount paid for the content should be proportional to everything else on the market. No matter what $15 means to you. Its on the very high end for subscription fees in mmos and substantially higher than other payment models. and its for a 15 year old game that wont be receiving any content updates that most of us already own
---
What was the crash?
---
Nice.
---
thats right
---
The subject is the 40 duel tournament
---
Collect everything and sell it. Vendor grey junk, put mats and gear on AH
---
Gnome warrior is bis for pvp
---
You didn't even jump the wall to grab Ratchet, Booty bay, Crossroads, Camp T, Thunder bluff, and then hearth back to spawm.
---
Shame
---
(Also, now you know)
---
I do actually, thats what im referring to my dude
---
.. I guess yours is too then?  I'm not trying to say that anything should be a certain way just because I think that way, I'm trying to illuminate what I see will be issues and also demonstrate how I think the way Blizz decided to price and structure the game is more of a cash grab than is reasonable.
---
Spell Batching means that events are processed in periodic batches rather than sequential individuals.
---
As you described this can cause two spells to take effect at the same time even though one was cast before the other, such as two mages sheeping each other.
---
This also means that there is an inherent delay in any action that is batched.
---
If spell batching occurs every 1 second then your spell may take effect up to 1 second after you cast it since the batch that contains your spell cast has to wait to be processed.
---
&gt;Well first off I am under the impression from everything I've seen and heard so far regarding this that no action was taken against him.
---
Then you are misinformed. Yet that obviously won't stop you from making wild assertions about things you don't have a grasp on. The player was removed from the dueling tournament and placed in Winterspring.
---
Every bit of your rant is predicated on you being horribly misinformed. You have taken that misinformation and manifested it into some nonsensical tangent while ignoring the facts at every step.
---
Furthermore you have the audacity to actually believe you somehow have some sort of logical highground when you aren't even privy to the facts.
---
You are a joke.
---
Warlock has a big advantage if both players are good and even in gear. If both players have consumables and engineering and are willing to drop 10g+ on a single duel that gap narrows close to a 50/50.
---
Now a Druid fighting a warlock, even if said druid has a crowd pummeler and 30 seconds immunity to fear as Blacksmith.. well that druid will probably still lose.
---
i dont think classic will become stale
---
also casuals are the biggest market cuz they usually have a lot of money
---
What? Nobody starts a duel with 5% hp. People will definitely have the right pet out and probably use one of their consumables.
---
First, the art is amazing thank you for posting it. Second, this makes me so hyped to play classic on another level, just the idea of being a scrubby dwarf on a snow forest, defending myself from a boar with a dagger and just a couple of skills, that's all I want right now.
---
&gt; And the number of items you need to turn in isn't actually that high. A single player can tackle a big chunk of one of the requirements. Pretty sure I did 1/5th of the thorium bars for alliance on my realm.
---
So you are claiming that you alone turned in 4,800 thorium bars aka 240 stacks of thorium bars. 
---
The overall total amount of items needed is enough to fill 875 (ish) characters who have all bottomless bags (18 slots) and bottomless bag filled banks completely.
---
My character doesn't live in his moms basement without a job or girlfriend
---
UD and gnome warr is quite common, female tauren I can agree on, really any class.
---
I know I'm stupid, but how do you download the image?
---
More advanced =/= better.
---
I personally loathe the new models. Everything bounces and jumps around, it's ridiculous.
---
I agree. Personally I would love for my armour to look like armour and not just painted skin. It would make no difference to game-play and just make the armour look more accurate and closer to what the intended design was originally. Limited by server size, storage size etc. to make the game run at an acceptable rate, I understand they needed to restrict those things back then, not now!
---
I would be worried if I were classicdb, in its current version it's a mix of old and new itemization. Sometimes even itemization from TBC onwards.
---
It has decent tools, but a lot of work needs to go into updating it.
---
Yeah you don’t get banned for “screwing over” a streamer.
---
Don't forget you need to purchase skills for your pet as well and that can get pretty costly
---
I think it's relatively safe to say that cheaper sub = more players = more interest.  
---
Of anyone reading this- the majority of us probably played WoW before and unsubbed at some point.  I came back and unsubbed twice.  It's really stupid to sub to $180/year for a game you barely play.  If it's cheaper, you will retain more of those part-time players over the long run and maintain higher populations.
---
It hugely depends on what part of the world you have been born in
---
Do you not have a phone?
---
I hadn't thought only using rank 1 wing clip and scare beasts, that's a good idea. Didn't know mongoose was static, ew.
---
Yes, but your math is a little off. 
---
Thorium stacks in 20's, so 240 stacks takes 240 bag spaces. If your bank alts are using cheap 12-slot bags, you have 64 slots per character. That means you need about four bank characters to store 5,000 bars.
---
This is 100% the best and only option.
---
Classic + and all these other stupid ideas suck, just leave classic as it was and in a few years release a tbc realm for people that want more content.
---
Classic + actiblizzard style would be a complete abomination unto vanilla, just don’t.
---
Very true, I'll have to look at that.
---
Between: Demonic Armor, Life Tap, Drain Life, Drain Mana, Siphon Life, Death Coil and Health Stone, Why would you **ever** focus purposely stack spirit as a Warlock?
---
Spirit is a **complete waste** for Warlocks.
---
&gt; Aren't skinning mats going to get driven down to dirt cheap prices on most servers? 
---
You vendor them
---
If it is a duel locks have a big problem a sizable amount of there spells are shadow based. The mage can just wear 300+ shadow resistance and win the attrition war. In open world it is more of a question of who sees who first/how gets the jump on anoter

I thought gnome had the best caster racials. Why would gnome mage be uncommon
---
The addition of cancellable flight paths necessitated the change to a generic animation. Looks like trash but it was functional.
---
Unless you really care to min/max race doesn't matter too much.
---
Bis gear for every class is easy enough to google. 
---
Hard to give any tips when you don't say what class and spec you are looking to play.
---
Companies price for what they think their customer base will pay. People will pay $15 to play this game.
---
I always play gnome warriors, something about a small boi with a big weapon beating the shit out of big people just turns me the fuck on (not in a sexual way) there's a picture that encapsulates why I find it so badass here: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vanilla-wow/images/8/8a/GnomeWarriorTCG.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150413100434
---
Yes, and I had some left to spare. (Played a rogue with uncontested control of the rich thorium nodes in Silithus for several weeks.) 
---
The four bank alts filled with thorium was just the beginning. Had maybe 16 bank alts in total.
---
&gt; Remember that in classic you can only put 1 item in the mail at a time.
---
I'm pretty sure they said they're changing that. And regardless, even if they don't, there will be a day-one addon for it. Guaranteed.
---
You know there is more to this game than raiding.
---
“The act of having a neutral and broad-minded outlook on dating strategies and gender relations, being neither inclined to platitudes or feminism, nor excessively adhering to adrosphere talking points.
---
Basically, midway between bluepill and redpill”
---
I'd tend to agree. Although I think if it comes down to another horde duel tourney, a Mage takes it again.
---
Had the error box pop up, reloaded UI and crashed. Deleted the addon file, re-extracted and still got the addon error box, so having to disable the addon completely for now :(
---
yeah... deepthroat the only moron dumb enough to agree with you. lmao
---
Elling Trias, &lt;Master of Cheese&gt;
---
Well dual weilding tanks definitely will not. Pservers don't get the parry haste right. You swing off handers at them, they will Windfury tripple crush the tank too many times
---
As long as you loot everything you should have enough gold. Pick up trash and vendor it from level 1 and by the time you get riding that's like a good chunk towards it.
---
Also do t buy AH blues at level 30
---
You have to run the whole way. The good news is that most players have to run to Thunder Bluff between levels 14-20 to pick up quests for RFC or WC anyway, and so you will already have the flight path when it comes time for you to do the same.
---
I mean you shouldn't but its kind of important to be able to ss with daggers while leveling (in fact I think you have to at early levels).
---
Equally geared characters, lock wins 9 out of 10 times vs mage
---
One of my favorite things to do on the official forums when I was subbed was check out the customer service forum and read the occasional threads by people who got squelched, silenced, or banned "for no reason." Let me tell you something about most of the people who claim they were reported "for no reason"--***they're lying***. They're full of shit. Just liquid hot shit up to their eyeballs.

[This poor gentleman](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20767667190?page=2#post-34) was silenced but there's no proof he did anything wrong. Except the chat logs showing he used a racial slur... in chat with a GM.

[This kind soul](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760595858#post-2) was silenced for no reason. All he did was joke about terrorism and sexual assault in trade. This valiant crusader of justice went on to challenge the authority of Blizzard staff and their Terms of Service, calling the out for their flagrant abuse of power in enforcing the ToS we all agree to before we can play.

[This unlucky bastard](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20768896939#post-18) keeps getting reported and silenced! So unfair, he did nothing wrong, not even when he used explicit sexual statements and profanity in trade chat.
---
[So unfair](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762287193#post-15)  that you can't grossly violate chat rules without risking getting right click reported!
---
Anyway, right click report or not, if you leave a bad impression on the community you're gonna have a bad time. There is no CRZ for you to disappear into, and layering is going away when phase 2 launches. For what it's worth, generally to get enough players to report you to actually get your account actioned, you might want to re-think whatever it was you did that pissed off so many people and violated the ToS. Since you're already excessively concerned that you'll be penalized by the community I've a hunch you're one of the folks I mentioned right off the bat and I look forward to your salt after launch.

Im real life friends with Menismyforte and he clipped these, not me, and he didn't do it to try and deceive anyone.
---
Next time just post the bits that lead you to believe what you are claiming still holds true and not the part where you make assumptions on intent. 
---
I have WAY MORE clips, some that seem to strengthen your argument and some that don't, because of lag and other variables that are hard to identify considering the footage is 12+ years old.
---
People have asked for video clips from vanilla to aid your argument, you get hyper defensive and refuse to do so. I offered a SMALL bit of evidence and NEVER indicated it definitively proved you wrong and you, again, got defensive. Get a grip my dude.
---
Yup, my plan was to work and study at the same time, and try to have some decent social life for furst time in my life, I ditched TBC and came back at the end of WotLK until WoD.

Thank you for not saying the N-word.

Please rememember that you may not say the N-word until you obtain an N-word pass.

Thank you.

The way I understand it is by the time you’re 40-50 the server won’t be sharding. At all. So you’ll only have your zone and everyone will be in it on the server.
---
From all hunters everywhere, THANK YOU! I really like the addition of Multi-shot as well. Most people don't realize that you clip autos with MS if you cast it late in the "white" portion.  
---
In regards to why you would want the aimed shot/multi shot cast bars (you mentioned you had no idea why) it's so you don't end up moving during that time, and the game doesn't display the cast bars for you anyways. You can't move while casting either of them, so its helpful to know how long to stand still with a cast bar.
---
Druids can TP to Moonglade at level 14, going to TB to train is a non-issue at that point.
---
&gt;  It's abundantly available on private servers- and while they "aren't perfect" they are pretty damn close to the original experience.
---
Have you ever played on a Private server? only to find out that your hard earned gear means nothing when GM's create full geared lvl 60's to sell, sell gold under the table whilst pretending to ban exploiters/dupers until they cough up hundreds$$ to get their characters back? or perhaps the possibility that at any moment your characters will be deleted. 
---
It is abundantly clear that you haven't a clue what you're talking about. $15 in 2004 = $20 in 2019. You're getting a 25% cheaper sub.
---
There was not a lot moaning hapening to be honest, just a lot of awkward heavy breathing
---
Eh se' joke...
---
Am I the only one who always wanted him to stand up from the grave turn around, and have her standing behind him also undead? &gt;.&gt;
---
Lol “oh Donhea...” “Donhea!!” “Oh DonhYea!!”
---
Nice!
---
I'm actually sad that they upped it to 40 because of this haha.
---
I wanted Hunters to stay under the radar, but Bestial Wrath is too strong at this level.
---
I'm personally gonna run mining and skinning, then swap to mining and engineering late. Enchanting can be be a good money maker early if you wanna sell wands and such.
---
I tanked in TBC as well and threat was not a big deal unlike in Vanilla. I dont even remember having Omen threat meter unlike in Vanilla. 
---
In Vanilla the 3-4 sunder rule was strictly enforced. As Raids progressed through content the MT would start speccing out of Prot and into Furry to get more threat. 
---
As to video .... I am not able to find a single piece of anything about any topic when it comes to vanilla from 13+ years ago.
---
I hate the new art style of the game and the new models are crap.
---
Right but for new players or people like me who stopped back in cata only returning only a few times. we cant farm tokens.
---
Dont you think it would be more sensible for Blizzard to have a Classic only Sub so people arent paying for a live service game they have no plans on playing?
---
Meh idk honestly.  Ven is one of the best mages in the world and he ALMOST lost to a hunter and a shaman.  He gets ice barrier but shamans now have stromstrike and can purge off ice barrier in a global and hunters will more than likely go bm so now they have to deal with a hunter having beastial wrath on the pet for a full 18seconds cc immune and an intimidate that they will have to save their blink for so no more blinking in deadzone range.
---
Imo I think mages will be one of the weaker classes at 40.  But idk it’s anyone’s guess
---
The real problem with your comment is the fact that you are trying to predict the future.  
---
How do you know whats going to happen? You dont. Your opinion is literally invalidated because theres absolutely no way for you to know 3 months ahead of time.  
---
This post is not an opinion, as you claim, its just a blatant attempt at causing drama and spreading toxicity.
---
Ninja'ing items is a fantastic way to get yourself blacklisted so gl with that. Classic won't have all this cross-server garbage so people definitely do remember names if you are constantly a prick.
---
If you hit melee then move out to auto and your melee attack speed is greater than 1.2 sec, you will have both bars actively tracking. At least, if the bar for hunter shots is seperate from melee bar
---
You get basically 0 exp as soon as a guard helps you kill something. You can use it sometimes to help you do quests that you have difficulty killing the mobs for, but it's far from a strategy that can help you level.
---
I would rather when BFA and maybe another expansion runs its course. They make wow 2, yes it will be the exact same story. But let’s see the entire thing done with the polish of retail and the lessons learned from classic.
---
You can definitely try it. If nothing else it will get you a feel for Imp. Mana Burn/Imp. Inner Fire and if they work out for you. The loss of Imp. VE is not huge deal. I think you'll feel the loss of Imp. Mind Blast more in PvP, just that extra burst is sexy as heck.   
---
Have you considered 4/5 Shadow Weaving and 3/5 Imp. MB instead? You still have an 80% chance to apply per cast, and after 5x that point is worthless.
---
its a joke you nerd
---
What was the error &gt;.&gt;
---
OP is talking min maxing with intellect and spell damage ... this would only be relevant in Raids so I talked about raiding.
---
My girlfriend was skeptical about classic but willing to try. I let her do character creation on a pserver just so she could see if female trolls could be made to look pretty.
---
I kind of miss her. it's late and she's done blackfathom deeps, SM and Razorfen Kraul tonight. I'm looking forward to getting so many stories together and going on adventures :).
---
Ay man i fully agree, i play games for relaxation and enjoyment were its their job
---
whatever you can in OH until you actually spec into sword spec
---
If that's the way you and your group feel works best for you, there's no reason why you couldn't implement it.  It wouldn't be my preference (especially since someone buying an item for points is the way points are earned in zero-sum DKP) but infinite customization is one of the fun aspects of DKP.
---
Right. After bc I rolled a blood elf priest on a new server and leveled shadow and mostly did questing. The process was much faster. However I had more fun healing as it was a more social experience. Since I really only ever healed with that character, I stuck to healing talents and gear.
---
I mean you can just turn it off if you don't like it? That's the point of a toggle?
---
So what game are you playing here?
---
If you are going sword spec use swords in both. You want a faster weapon offhand to apply dps poisons.
---
Any ideas of changing classic at all from its absolute purest form won’t be taken positively on this subreddit.
---
Oh my mistake. I forgot that things like spell crit and spell damage don't mean anything in PvP.
---
Are the raid frames part of the package? Idk if grid will be working in classic and this looks pretty close to it
---
It depends. Ideally you want a super fast offhand sword to get most poison procs and also get sword procs. But those can be hard to find, and with dps and stats into the consideration, it's really confusing. Just go for generally good dps weapon, if it's fast that's a bonus, if it has good stats, that's a bonus, if it's a sword that's another bonus.
---
I may have been unclear. I'm not suggesting they adjust the art style of the game at all. I'm talking about texture resolution and depth of exiting armour / weapon models in vanilla. ie a metal bracing on a shield, instead of having diagonal line running across a shield being pixelated, but remaining flat on the shield, it would be crisp, appear to be a different material and have the depth that it would in real life (or closer to it).
---
That is completely incorrect. I remember leveling as a paladin and actually pooled gold with the friend warrior to get him the mount since I got a free one. Unless you get lucky and get a BOE blue or Epic you will not have any gold. I remember struggling even buying my greater seals and reagents for the raid let alone repair bill.
---
The burnout is real  it was a mistake.   wait till aug 27th or the hype is gonna die
---
You're missing the fact that you absolutely do not need to be holy spec to heal through low level instances.  In this situation you can have your cake and eat it too.
---
This is really awesome to hear, but when is Wowhead going to fix the biggest issue: their website?
---
It’s been borderline unusable for years, due to popups and viruses and being the absolute slowest website to load on the internet. Has that been fixed yet?
---
Its not a relevant if i can afford it though. the game is complete and we all already own it more than likely. the $15 cost comes from retail wow. if you take that out of the equation and only off a classic sub it should be much, much lower. im sure you wouldnt think it fair to pay for a service you arent using.
---
My argument is they should offer a cheaper model for those who only want to play classic. its about the fairness of pricing, not how poor or rich i am
---
I get that. He's trying to imply what I was saying was this outrageous rule set to start a duel. A warlock simply using two warlock abilities in a duel isn't comparable to starting out with 5%
---
imo D3 is much better about streamlining the non-combat parts of the game, which is why it's my casual ARPG of choice. Very easy to just jump in and play for 20-30 minutes here and there with as much time spent mowing down hordes of baddies as possible.
---
It won't completely stop world buffing, but it will make it that much more tedious to the point where less people will do it. Having to get worldbuff at a specific time and then raidlog until then will be a big deterrent. Only the most tryhard guilds will require world buffs.
---
Definitely looks a touch lower too. I like it.
---
I'm not saying the more advanced models are necessarily better and I'm not talking about adding models to the game, I'm talking about editing existing ones to appear more realistic and fall in line with today's graphics.
---
I'm not saying to add bouncing things to the armour, I'm saying to add layers and depth to existing models.
---
Thanks for your input though, nice to see how many people are happy with the way it is!
---
Once you get the sword spec talent you really want a sword. The quest reward sword for Scarlet Monastery (both factions) is 1.9 speed I believe. That's about as good as you're gonna see while leveling and should last you quite a while.
---
They've said that abusing it will be punished, for what it's worth.
---
This. There is no cross realm. You aren't hidden by a pool of 8 million people in classic. If you screw someone over there is a very high chance you will see them again.
---
Yeah, after the journey's over and all of the relationships should have been formed.
---
Here's what I would like to see happen.
---
1. Use AI like ESRGAN to upscale the vanilla textures. This preserves the original look and color, it just reduces pixellation and can potentially bring out some fine details that are not easily seen on such small textures. It would still look like vanilla, it would just be crisper with less pixellation.
---
2. Increase the poly count on existing models, doodads, objects, etc. There are some models that look like they were ripped straight out of the n64. They looked awful in 2005, they look awful now. Preserve the vanilla animations, they are superior.
---
3. I woudn't mind some new geosets for some gear. I liked the boot model introduced in Wrath for example. But I woudln't want them to get as carried away with it as they did later down the road. I would love to see a little depth added to armor and weapon models, but nothing extreme.
---
4. For shit's sake let's get some less boxy trees.
---
I would love a graphical update, but I strongly prefer it to maintain the vanilla look and feel. ESRGAN (or similar) upscaling of the default textures and rounding out some of the sharper, low-poly models would be beyond sufficient to update the visuals.
---
Followed by the Charge sound effect.
---
It has been a while but I believe you can check out your "pets" stats, including armor, when you mind control an NPC.
---
That's not necessarily true. I am on this subreddit and I think updates to the textures and models of armour would be great.
---
Not to mention the countless QoL changes they are going to be making to classic that people are happy with.
---
They dont, PVP was all about stamina and best possible gear no matter the stats. The intelect vs crit did not matter at all. PVP did not have min maxing for warlocks.
---
My raid leader yelled at me on vent, "Majache!! WAKE UP!! WE NEED YOUR DPS DAMNIT!"
---
He was in the army and he had one of those voices that jolts you right the fuck up. Needless to say, I fell asleep mid encounter.
---
what is this addon plz?
---
Warlocks eat mages. The gap is less severe at lower levels of gear, and more severe if the warlock is SL.
---
The age of the game is relevant due to it being complete with no new content updates. Subscription fees are designed for frequent updates in live service games. i agree with you that graphics mean very little.
---
Blizz wont be your problem here
---
Yeah, I'm planning to level to at least 6 or 7 via fedex &amp; exploration grabbing several flight points along the way.
---
OH is gonna miss like a bitch so no difference what you have, plus OH usually had crippling.
---
Sure, don't address anything that I said and accuse me of being poor.  Have a nice night.
---
Would love to see this for other classes as well. Nice work!
---
It's currently being worked on. Don't know what name he is going to call it
---
.
---
[\*It ain't me starts playing...\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0XKhAHR5I)
---
it's called yellowstar
---
&gt; Other than that go nuts, the things you listed are some of the most fun ways to get a good laugh in the game
---
wouldnt this
---
&gt;be careful because you will gain a reputation on the server which may hinder progression, if it's "true" classic.
---
go against this
---
Is this the time it takes to level to 60?
---
That sounds awesome. Where are u from ?
---
May 18th.  
---
That's after people resubbed to try to get into the beta which started the 15th.
---
30-0-21 (affliction/desto) is actually the highest damage spec in raiding. But you can only have 1-2 warlocks in that spec.
---
Food and water vendors. Bout to print money!
---
Boi that ain't a vanilla U.I, there us still screen real estate there to be had. Need the weather hug app, the clock app, and the bejeweled app too
---
There will never be enough tanks, trust me.
---
there is still a lot of work going into it tho...
---
oof, as much as i enjoy deepthroating strangers on the internet, If you read through the thread nobody has really raised any counterpoints to my arguments. infact i dont think most of them read it
---
I completely forgot about autoshot timing...
---
I've tried, I just can't. Too jarring, I try to press 4 and end up pressing 5, etc. Same issue with moving strafe from Q and E to A and D. I'm just so used to strafing on those 2 buttons that It's too late to change
---
First, no. At level 60 and 300 Weapon Skill, only a level 63 mob will have the +hit modifier that requires an extra 1%.
---
Second, the technical, and thus mathematical difference between "8% miss, you just need an extra +1% hit" and "9% miss" is zero. Just call it 9% miss or 9% hit cap. Don't be stupidly pedantic.
---
I started by watching this [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKx3qqbdMfY) by Kargoz, check out his other videos and presentations for the those classes
---
f
---
Due to much older technology and much worse connection the game processed actions in less of real time and almost in batches of lets say half a second long. (arbitrary) So if two players executed an actions in that half a second it would resolve simultaneously resulting in funny outcomes.
---
Now technology is better but Blizzard specifically said they will "simulate" batching like it was in Vanilla.
---
Each tick of Mind Flay and SW:Pain can proc Shadow Weaving?  
---
If yes, 3/5 SWeaving and 4/5 Imp. MB!?
---
There have been many people offering counterpoints. Your argument is flawed.
---
This poster is accurate. If your raid micromanages debuff slots, then you'll have room for 1 corruption on the boss. So one warlock can go SM-Ruin, while everybody else is spamming shadowbolt.
---
Then don't pay it
---
Balance is everything, that and alts
---
Actually, there's a bunch of things people figured out to make feral cat work really well. Problem is you have to farm a 2handed mace from Gnomeregan that has 3 charges, so you have to farm up multiple of these for raid night. It gives you like 50% attack speed and is better than the legendary staff. 
---
Then there's also power shifting that gives you 100 energy every 5 sec..
---
I'm definitely thinking of going feral in classic with everything private servers have figured out lol
---
I was just trying to start the song lol
---
It's stupid how hyped that just got me.
---
I literally started off by addressing what you said. How fucking stupid are you?
---
Yeah but druids are very dependant on training skills while leveling tbh, you'd be making that trip to TB then back to TG often, like every 2-3 levels. It's possible but would be a bitch
---
Like 20% more damage for auto attack based classes (rogues and warriors)
---
At least its not call of duty
---
I mean it's pretty clear that "Beta" is partially sort of an exclusive early access for a bunch of Streamers. I hope at least part of the other people that are not polluted by pservers are actually testing stuff.
---
Aye!
---
Given what the updated models in retail have looked like, hell no. I'd be okay with like, increasing the texture resolution (using the same texture, use some fancy shit to clear it up because just scaling it won't work for shit ofc) maybe.
---
I think higher dps offhand makes for better overall dps rather than trying to get a fast offhand, while leveling.
---
https://wowtokenprices.com/
---
I check it here, it's sub 120k now
---
So they have updated this in the Beta already?
---
K E K
---
Yeah, I don’t remember that being the end of forming relationships. Especially as how I typically played much more than people I met and out leveled them.
---
Completely agree, but they would be only affliction in the name as Shadow Bolt was the main spell. Since Shadow bolt was your number one source of damage and you had the 200% damage on spell crits (unlike regular 150%) crit was the number one stat. Mana pool was irrelevant since mana tap.
---
This really fucking hurts to read.
---
My feels.
---
Unfortunately it won't be big enough for rogues to take advantage of to any real extent considering nothing else they have scales with SP really. But rogues might use the oils for a small dps boost, though I kind of doubt it will be much bigger than crit stones or etc sadly.
---
You want double swords.  
---
The general progression will be whatever you can get until Scarlet Monestary, then the SM sword, then the RFD sword, then the Mauradon sword, then whatever you can get close to or at 60 (e.g. Dal Rends).
---
Was bugged before, beast lore too, to not show armor.
---
Big true.
---
I wouldn’t worry as much about Blizzard banning you as I would be for acquiring a shitlord reputation on your server. This painting a target on you to get kicked from groups prior to your shitlord antics having a chance to be shown. 
---
Being locked on a server with the same people can/will make your reputation more important then the report feature.
---
Yep, you got what I saw. I was able to get in, and start to make a character. Then down it went, and now its gone. Was so excited, and now, just have to wait for the stress tests again (was in 1 &amp; 2).
---
Wegotplayed.
---
This is such a stupid thread.
---
It's a shame you skipped Pandaria, it was such a good expansion.  Classic Wow will be waiting whenever you get a new computer!
---
I've been rediscovering Black Desert Online though I will probably jump back to Legion league for bit to try it out as well.
---
Ah. Would’ve got it if I knew about undead rogues.
---
Sensible for people like us, yes.  But Blizz wants more $$
---
That is mostly what I would like, enhance the texture resolutions, because blurry lines are ugly. If there is a skull on my belt, make it a skull, no some blob that slightly resembles one.
---
Here's an example of a downranking macro. Super useful so you don't have to set different hotkeys for the same spell.
---
/cast [mod:shift] Frost Shock Rank 1  
---
/cast [mod:alt] Frost Shock Rank 3  
---
/cast [mod:ctrl] Frost Shock Rank 6
---
You get out of here with your logic!!
---
Yo if you want to show me some, that would be dope. 
---
From what ive read, people are confusing my intentions quite alot.
---
my argument is that there should be a seperate subscription for classic so people arent paying for retail if they dont want to. which should reduce the cost by a ton which in turn will retain more players and help the playerbase grow.
---
Yeah. Was curious why so many streamers kept doing quests just for some gear at 30. Screwing themselves out of xp.
---
LMAO....Yeah, the hate you must have gotten.
---
&gt; To further assist testing efforts, we will reduce the cost to respec closed beta characters. The new cost will be charged in silver instead of gold, a 99% reduction in cost, and will only be applied to the beta test.
---
This is a good change for the beta. Wanted to respec to try something different and it cost 1g at level 20 for my first time respec. 
---
I forgot how punishing that shit was.
---
This is why you're not in the beta.
---
Is there any other class to play in classic? Maybe rogue and mage, but the rest are shit.
---
Ya, after the restart. I just noticed it when I flew to SW from Westfall, and decided to capture the return flight.
---
&gt;Warriors were almost always the leaders of 5 man groups, because it was the only way they could manage to get a dungeon run going
---
Maybe I'm misremembering, but I think the tank is usually the person putting together the party just because it makes the most sense, since they'll likely be the one marking and setting the pace. I don't remember it being because there were too many tanks, it was more just because we could get the ball rolling better ourselves rather than join an existing group of 3 dps and rely on them to find a healer. 
---
But it's been a while and my memory isn't what it used to be.
---
Ya I loved how it used to skim the ground or water sometimes. Feels much my dynamic.
---
That is what I am doing hut first doing tailoring enchanting to get a lesser magic wand then not really care to much.
---
I dove into vanilla and tbc servers and I said the same thing but I couldn’t help it, while not playing as much as I would. I’m not too eager to share my time on there. 
---
That game is just so much better than anything else for me.
---
Cloth gives armour too. It is close to 40% the total physical dmg reduction spriests get. And you're usually only healing when enemy is CCd anyway since it's a massive waste of time trying to get heals off whilst being trained.
---
And you ran out of arcane powder. Slacker
---
Any game, especially from a AAA studio, should have maintenance and some ongoing support.  That is already a given expectation of the gamer playerbase as a whole across the whole spectrum.  
---
Many games charge nothing for the ongoing maintenance at all, instead offering microtx, cosmetic purchases, or even PTW type situations which we can all agree we don't want.  
---
Many other companies simply take their profit from the first game, have a small team devoted to maintenance, and work on developing new, fresh games to build on the loyalty of their playerbase.  They don't charge you more than once for their game, they just try to win you back with top-quality experiences.
---
Kind of depends on what source you use. The general notion would agree with you. Im 22 and some people would call me a Millenial and some would call me a Gen Z.
---
Did you eat a lot of paint chips as a kid? that would explain a lot. Im literally losing braincells reading your comments.
---
1. I agree and this is exactly what I would like to see happen.
---
2. I also agree with this, some of the models in vanilla look great, some look absolutely awful. It's almost like designer teams got two different memos.
---
3. I agree with the depth part. There are some models that are made to look like they would be layered, like belt buckles and different textures on shields/weapons that resemble other textures or materials, but are just pushed into 2D, I wish those were 3D.
---
4. Some of the trees in BFA are beautiful, even some of the MoP trees were really nicely made. I love the feeling of being in a forest and it feeling like a forest (with navigation taken into account), some areas in BFA, the warfronts etc. look great. One tree every 20 steps in somewhere like Elwynn Forest just makes no sense. Rename it Elwynn Plains.
---
Thanks for your input man.
---
That's a great idea. Was there huge benefits for helping the war effort other then opening the gates? I might just need to look up the wiki page to see what will benefit me the most.
---
If the stars align, the lock goes afk, and the mage has engineering....
---
... The name still loses, sorry
---
I think just into friendly. This also differs. For example undead or neutral with the other races by default.
---
Your theory seems most likely to me.
---
im making this argument based on consumer value. 15 years ago it was a live service game and you $15 dollars went towards the development of content in a live service game.
---
this price isnt necessary for the game anymore if you exclude the combination sub with retail. which is why im proposing the Classic only sub
---
C'thun is the start of the real challenge. Anything before that can have 10 people afk and still be fine.
---
&gt;But this doesn’t happen in the US does it? (Legit question)
---
[no. Because no one is going to issue a warrant and raid a house with guns in it for some downloaded songs.](https://imgur.com/a/lGmu2LH) The only way they would do anything, and it would be a notice to appear in court if anything. You would get noticed If you were the guy uploading all the thousands of songs/movies. and even then. They wouldn't raid your house for hours. That is honest to God shit they do to drug dealers and gangs and people in foreign countries that have no legal way to defend themselves from tyrannical bullshit. if they raid your house over downloaded from bearshare. You best believe they coming hot and heavy if you was up to some real shit.

You will against fully naxx geared dps in 2k worth of consumables each.

I think the bears in Dun Morogh were some of the scariest things Id ever experienced in gaming when I started Wow.

I see. Sounds like something they would do to an annoying asshole after they got enough complaints. Not someone that violated their terms and service and was griefing.
---
So whos on the nonsensical rant now? You can't even realize you just proved your argument wrong.
---
You sir are the joke.
---
This is something I always laugh at. TBC and WotLK came out when people still had so much to do. Every expansion after now drags out for a year when everyone is already done everything.
---
would you honestly rather people not play the game over paying just for classic and nothing else though? i feel like its in the game and communities best interest to open the gates to as many new and returning players as possible
---
Ironforge looked fuckin awesome!
---
Not a fan of the more normal Unreal buildings though.
---
Christ you can't even remember what you said. How do you even get your shoes on the right feet in the morning?
---
&gt;Take action against him
---
You are pathetic.
---
This is effing amazing. As long as they can preserve the depth of the world and it doesnt become another flat Korean mmo world without a soul, I'd play the everliving shit out of this.
---
I see--thank you!
---
Hopefully they are tracking different timers. I don't even know how they could be tracking the same timer because they aren't linked in any way.
---
The timer was the best thing ever added to WSG.
---
That makes sense.
---
but not to the same scale as retail by a very very large margin, so wouldnt you think its completely fair to offer a classic only sub for the people who dont want to pay for both versions?
---
Dont ninja loot.
---
Hey, sorry for the delay.  I've recently polled our member base and it looks like we're locked in as a CST guild, with our activity being in the area of sunday-thursday, from 7-10 PM CST.
---
For some insane reason healers have joined en masse, but we're light on damage roles, so you'll have an easy time getting into a PVE raid slot as mage or rogue.
---
It's nothing like Everquest epics.  Granted, some of them are cheap and easy to multiquest (rogue, cleric, monk, and a few others), but others are so severely bottle-necked that they are practically impossible to obtain from bosses locked down by the top guild/s.
---
&gt;Every dungeon became scarlet monastery.
---
Yeah, but who doesn't love SM?

The ad providers that serve the ads on Wowhead do not frequently or regularly serve popups and viruses. Short of never having ads, which would make the site shutter due to not generating revenue to cover original development costs, there is no way to ensure zero popups come through. But we do try to take a number of steps to ensure we are not serving those types of ads, use ad-filtering software, and get directly in touch with the ad providers if we do find one that breaks our TOS.

Wow has a certain style that Id like to be upheld, but Im up for better textures and models.
---
You are not missing anything besides the burnout.   Wait till Aug 27th and  enjoy your two weeks before looking for something else to do.
---
Take action against him..... as in action against him in violation of the ToS.....which is the topic of the original comment.
---
Keep up kid.
---
You're having your own argument it seems I'm talking about action against him as in, a ban.  He didn't get banned, he was being a dick so the GM was a dick to him. No bans=no violation of ToS.
---
That's it, that's the argument, it's done, you're wrong, accept it.
---
Bye.
---
Man, 25% of raiders clearing naxx by 6 month is high. I know its been awhile and all the tutorials are out now, but if my memory is correct only 21 guilds beat naxx back in vanilla.
---
Should just skip them all and roll a warlock
---
I had the stress test, then it was removed from my launcher, and it still tells me "no servers available".
---
Do you guys dont have phones?

Bold of you to assume i still dont eat paint chips. im down with you bringing up some counterpoints here if you would like to. trying my best to reply to everyone and im open to having a compelling argument

Easy as can be.
---
Guess that depends how you level. I ran dungeons over and over and over. Fighting elites and bosses meant a fast off hand and poisons did the best.
---
I want to play a 14 year old game. I want to play the game as it was. Agree to disagree but you retail ship jumpers don’t need to be so toxic while you ruin the game for the rest of us.
---
I’m capped on my warrior in beta and have almost run out of things to test. Submitted dozens of bug reports and have tested various mechanics/convoluted and out of the way quests/values and the like.
---
I don’t think I can stomach any more and certainly don’t wish to burn out going to 40 and beyond. 
---
If I could return my beta invite and someone else be allocated a chance I would.
---
Soz.
---
No, only the initial application of the spell. Dot ticks can proc blackout, but not apply additional Shadow Weaving. Additionally only damaging spells apply it (e.g. not fear/VE).
---
Hello fello 12/13 year old that played classic!  I began day 1 of release after playing WC3 for a ridiculous amount of time.  I found your story so similar to mine, my second character day 1, my first being undead, was a Dwarf Paladin named Balin.  He has been with me ever since to this day, even though he wasn't my main moving forward in BC, it was a warrior named Feramirr.  
---
WoW has been a huge part of my life and the larger than life server celebrities, guild celebrities, IF chat celebrities made up a huge part of my growth into an adult.  I enjoyed your story, if you ever want to reminisce shoot me a PM!
---
Nope, youre lying because the mount wasnt free. The quest required gold and expensive mats. It was cheaper but it wasnt free. I mained Paladin too
---
I remember being a noob not looting everything and my cousin giving me that tip. And since then I was never tight on gold for my mount
---
I started in Vanilla but I never hit cap and so most of my early wow days were in TBC (which is my fav xpac), Classic gives me an opportunity to complete Vanilla.
---
The first and last letter are correct
---
Amazing, thanks for that link. This is all so exciting for my human warrior ahah.
---
Jesus Christ how could anyone live off of 700 a month? That’s what $750-$800? That’s less than the average rent for a 1 bed apartment. I’m sorry y’all have to experience that.
---
SOUL SHARDS!!! nah
---
All new models and animations are fucking disgusting. Made wow look like a game for 5 year old girls.
---
Across several countries, 4g often pings lower and is more stable for me. YMMV
---
Hi, probably not, the idea is to cater to people who want to raid later in the evening. The start times may change by +/-30 by the time everything is up and running but it won't be as early as 8pm.
---
dont worry at least you nailed it the first time. I couldn't figure it out I almost ended up putting it in her rear. lol
---
Hello all! I'm like many if you here, played vanilla back in the day and looking to get. Ack into I  release. I'm looking for:
---
-NA EST Horde PVP 
---
-raid times preferably in the evening anywhere from 7PM on, days of the week are flexible just would stay away from Friday and Saturday evenings. Even open to Sunday day time.
---
- I MTd in vanilla up through some aq 40 then healed in BC and back to tank at WOTLK. Even became GM of our guild in wrath and had some nice progression at points. After cata I stopped playing but excited to get into it. 
---
This go around I'm looking at going mage to start then alting a warrior. I also have a solid group of about 10 friends who played varying in hardcore to casual play styles that could help round out a guild's rosters. Not a package deal situation but rather a huge benefit. The only caveat is we want to be horde, and most of us live in the Boston/ NA eastern seaboard area. Send me a PM if you have any questions.
---
Teuff
---
Disney/Pixar models.
---
No, it's opinion, wtf dude. I don't understand how you can make a claim like that. I ain't predicting anything. I'm saying the way I think it'll go, sorry for having my own ideas?? I'm genuinely confused man. I didn't come here to pee in everyone's cereal, I saw this post and said my take. You are looking way too into it.
---
That would have made for some insane times on a pvp server.
---
I wonder how it would have been on the EQ pvp servers?
---
High detail item textures would look super out of place with the vanilla style player models.
---
Also Blizzard still hasn't gone back and updated those items from earlier expansions in retail why would they redo them for classic.
---
I am talking level 40 mount. Level 60 was out of the question for a while since it required 1000 gold and slightly less for warlocks and paladins. 
---
And no, just because you looted everything did not mean you had money unless you specifically farmed for it. At least in vanilla.
---
But paying for just classic is not an option, so if you want to play pay, or if you feel the price is too high don't.  You do you
---
I don’t particularly need a new laptop/pc as my work provides a work laptop that’s extremely nice for coding, I’m just not allowed to run games on it. To me, it isn’t worth purchasing a new laptop/pc just for wow as that’s the only game I play and the only thing I use my personal laptop for. But, I suppose if they did upgrade wow to something like this I would likely upgrade to a new one.
---
I was thinking about playing Warrior since my original first character was a Night Elf Warrior but I might save that for an alt. Will probably start as either Rogue or Warlock.
---
Ok, tested it. Previously had stress test access.
---
I write my acc and pass, then it asks for authenticator code then it goes to retrieving realm list, then comes up with "No realms currently available (WOW51900309)
---
Thanks for your input! If my suspicion is correct then it would mean  that your account wouldnt have access but my stress test one would. Let's hope that it means absolutely nothing, I have a feeling this invite wave will be much larger and a lot of people will be happy tomorrow.
---
I think it's very reasonable. They could make it 20-25
---
That’s what I thought, though I still run a vpn and proxy server to keep myself safe online but never considered the govt. knocking doors down over music.
---
Is SM/Ruin one of the main dps specs?
---
But the real question...you coming back for classic?

Is $15 steep for a 15 year old game? Yes.

The problem is about business. If classic wow was free to play, they would lose bfa subscribers and see increased costs regarding servers/support and Gms.

it’s just not smart to hurt your own profits.

&lt;Ghouls Gone Wild&gt; | OCE-PvP | Horde | Semi-Hardcore
---
Greetings! We from &lt;Ghouls Gone Wild&gt; truly hope that you are as excited as we are for the release of Classic World of Warcraft! To that end, we humbly invite you to join our newly formed guild in anticipation for the 27th of August release.
---
We strive to offer organised progression, whilst enabling those with busy schedules a chance to experience end game material. Our philosophy is; to meet likeminded people for social interaction, progress through raids and dominate battlegrounds/world PvP. 
---
Requirements: We are currently recruiting ALL classes and specs with a strong emphasis on your enjoyment (play what YOU want to play). We do ask that mature, honest and dedicated individuals need apply.
---
Raid Times: Thursday - 19.00 to 23.00 AEST 
---
                        Saturday - 09.00 to 13.00 AEST
---
We will start progression of MC on the 6th week following release, being Tuesday the 8th of October. Loot Council will be our method of distributing loot.
---
Aside from raiding, we wish to emphasise that you are more than welcome to join for a myriad of reasons. Levelling is one of the most rewarding aspects of Classic World of Warcraft, so we wish to enjoy and explore that together. Running dungeons on a nightly basis will be one of our top priorities throughout the life of Classic. 
---
PvP will also be on the forefront of our agenda. Battlegrounds are a great way to unwind after a busy day of work, especially when coupled with a beer and great bants. These will also be scheduled as to not leave anyone out who wishes to participate.
---
We inspire you to join our newly formed community, with the intention of building something amazing. If you have any questions regarding our guild, then please don't hesitate to contact myself or Moo on discord. Crazy#2348 or Daspectrum#1716 
---

&gt;	feeling desperate?
---
You are getting way too heated in a discussion about a game that came out 15 years ago
---
What spec do the other warlocks use?
---
And thats why i made the thread. i was hoping for open discussion on the premise of introducing the separate sub model. We are months out from launch. many things can change.
---
But yeah ill still play it, but the difference between me playing a 1 or 2 months and sticking with it for over a year is based on the pay model. im sure thats the same for alot of players
---
yep. worth noting though that spells are only batched for player on player interaction (including on friendly targets). spells on mobs are updated as fast as possible, obviously after a delay from latency
---
idk that World of Warcraft game that he helped make was pretty good.
---
Polish? Lessons? HAAAAAAHAHAHAAA
---
low effort? but this is a masterpiece. nice humble brag!!
---
The newer casting animations look so fucking dumb too. Like instant casts look like your cheering in the air or throwing something. It's fucking awful dude. Way to take the character out of the races. The warlock chaos bolt animation is the corniest of them all.
---
Your white damage will be your number one damage output in raids. Followed by your damage over time (poison and bleeds). If i remember correctly you 3 point slice and dice followed by 5 point rupture.  This may change if your guild is running low on debuffs but that's what i was permitted to do.
---
If your tank is worth their salt the only deagro ability you need is vanish. You will learn to work around your tank but general rule is wait for 3 sunders then go hard. Agro is all or nothing so just keep an eye on your recount. Once you get to 98-99% agro then vanish and you should be fine for the rest of the fight. I never watched agro after i vanished.
---
The new models are trash! I've never seen a bouncy Orc in my life. Blizzards current models and animations are little kiddy garbage.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? The old models wasnt changed until WARLORDS OF DRAENOR. and removed old options completely in Legion. Retail wow is nothing like the original game. doesnt look or feel like wow anymore.  I feel bad for anyone starting the game in the latest expansions.
---
&gt;Calling Deadmines VC seems like an NA phenomenon I'll never understand.
---
Well, what else would you call it? DM is taken by Dire Maul. VanCleef makes as much sense as anything else.

---
Still better than 3 polygon models. =)
---
They want to pump twitch views again, it dropped significantly.
---
I'm in the exact same boat. I literally have nothing to do until classic comes out and since the release date was announced and people started streaming beta, every game I used to play has now become extremely boring. But my account was made in MoP so me getting into the stress test is already more than I expected lol.
---
You are playing with the very last patch before TBC from the start. Fury warriors were considered the best at the time. I imagine that will be the most over played class thos time around. That being said, fury warriors will be rolling for your knives as off hand weapons.
---
I dont think it should be free, i think the cost should reflect the product and having a separate subscription for just classic would be better in the long run for player retention. as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, the idea to link the classic and retail subscriptions seems to be a way to artificially boost sub counts for bfa
---
You bet i do. I am going casual tho. I will not have the time to go full neckbeard mode but tbh i am too old for that. Last couple of days i tried a private to fresh up my  quest memories. And for my suprise i managed to play 3 hours and i started to get dizzy, my vision become somehow blury and shit. I guess i dont have the stamina to play 10 hours a day like before or maybe i just need to train my body for the degen lifestyle again.

Just remember, whomever goes to sleep first jas lost the game, and might aswell kill themselves.
---
Jeeze, I'm so used to them launching at 12 am pacific time I didn't even realize it was about 9 hours earlier.

There's already several companies that do this type of thing. :/
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Only the strong persevere though
---
Right?! Or the worst was when you just couldn’t get your body w/o immediately being in a mob so you suck it up and take the Rez sickness and go microwave food while you wait haha

100% worth imo, it's the equivalent to getting chinese once per month except you get 30 days of enjoyment rather than 10 minutes

Ironforge was from the movie I think. But the idea is to have them reworked to more modern standards not to make them Unreal like. :D

---
THE BOAR IS PREGNANT
---
So you're cheap, or you really don't care much for classic... lol
---
Thank you man! Well, so far our test results mean nothing unless someone ever gets what I'm getting, "You have been disconnected."
---
Thank you for your input!
---
What an unfortunate name.........
---
Ill be playing a Lock or a Rogue, might be both depending on how much play time I have. Ive never played any of the casters before so Warlock levelling will be completely new to me.
---
If you want criticism, seeing so many people running around the different starting areas was pretty cool but most of the video was kind of boring.  The fake-enthusiasm (1st kill, 1st level, getting sharded, getting ready to run to Stormwind) was very obvious and made me want to turn the video off.  I know you were speaking to people in twitch chat, but it doesn't work well with a cut-down video since you can't see any of the discussion before or context so acting excited for a rather mundane event out of nowhere was boring to watch.    2/10
---
That's fair, I agree it would look a little out of place if they were overhauled, but even against the character textures, some of the armour pieces are just not up to scratch.
---
As Blizzard releases Expansions (especially before Transmog/Pet Battle features), each expansion essential rendered previous version obsolete if you wanted more content. There would be no reason for them to update old content if no one is spending time doing that. They put the work into the content players are using daily etc.
---
Kek is actually older than WoW. It’s the transliteration of the Korean character ㅋ, which is kind of like their version of “lol”. Blizzard made it the translation for Horde’s “lol” as an easter egg, referencing how Koreans would always type ㅋㅋ in Starcraft.
---
What makes you think there is an upcoming beta wave??
---
I have a feeling players would riot if they tried that. im sure a select few would pay it. they would find empty servers too id think. Having a separate subscription for classic would only entice new players to join and even serve as a gateway to retail if they enjoy classic. in which case going to the normal $15 sub and spending money on the expacs. i can only see ways blizzard could benefit from the idea in the long run.
---
Oh damn that was like 100g. That's easy.
---
Yeah the epic riding must really be out of the question for you then.
---
I did this. First time I tested it I felt like a newb fumbling and fucking up. Slept on it and felt easier the next day. About 1.5 weeks and it felt sorta normal and my skill was back. 2 months now and it feels natural again
---
Stop giving me hope man! There is no suffering without hope!
---
Go play retail.
---
Common mistake for a lot of first timers i guess. Lol
---
We took a quick look and that data isn't in an obvious place, but we'll try to take a closer look in two weeks or so!
---
See you are the sort of person I am trying to understand. The sort of person that complains about things like pet battles. If there is no actual reward and its just a side thing some people do for fun why is it hurting you?
---
Man, double check your account beta participation settings.  I just found out I got deep dicked.
---
The day the beta appeared in the list, I checkmarked it to sign up.  Eventually I unsubbed; when word was getting out that they were only inviting subs, I never bothered to check to see if I got an invite.
---
The last few days, I hear more and more reports of inactives getting beta invites.  I go check my old email attached to the account, it's so bogged down with spam that I can't tell one way or the other whether there's a beta invite in there.
---
I log into the BNet launcher to try and check it that way... AND THE WOW CLASSIC BETA ISN'T EVEN SELECTED ANYMORE.  Fucking sleazeball shit.  I mean, I look the other way when they invite every influencer they could think of - most of them aren't 'testing' jack shit, but I get it.  But then to find out they just fuckin' decided to erase my account from the signup?
---
It shouldn't make a *functional* difference, and I suppose it doesn't, but for whatever reason, it just feels so much worse.
---
38 is gen y. Not millenials.
---
Upvote for this. Beastial wrath is unstoppable.

Go play Pokemon.
---
This is basically my classic guild's discord
---
I prefer to think that i like to pay for what i get. im hyped for classic. but i also know the $15 sub is for the retail version of the game with classic tacked ontop. i dont play retail anymore. i dont plan to. so for the many people like me, having a classic only sub makes alot more sense than paying for a service im not using.
---
I lost my virginity in '94 a couple of years after my wife was born. No, those two things are not related. I too was incel for the majority of my wow experience.

It dragged here and there, but every few weeks I made a concerted effort to farm parts and craft weapons and warframes. A couple weeks ago I managed to pull together 17 weapons and 12 warframes to use with an xp booster, got 2 MR out of it. The real drag now is that all of my remaining craftable weapons require Fieldrons, Detonite, and Forma
---
&gt;everyone gongs the gong
---
I don't think this is correct but I don't know enough about gongs to dispute it.
---
Because the other races were uneasy for including undead in the horde and didn’t trust them initially. I’d be suspicious of zombies too.
---
Ya know, Arena in Classic would be very interesting. You have to admit
---
My Human and Gnome both started 1000/6000 Friendly with Stormwind/Gnomeregan Exiles and 100/6000 Friendly with all other races IIRC.
---
UI mods are a must, and I might have some immersion mods if they're available. I dont want any help with quests though.
---
I'm glad. I've always felt it cheapened it a little.
---
That, but you also earn a lot of money vendoring or auction housing meat that you might otherwise have been tempted to cook or eat. 
---
For example, if you kill a highland strider (raptor in arathi highlands, one of the more popular mobs to kill for cooking mats), and you vendor everything it drops but use the cooking mats, it is a value of ~164c/kill.
---
If you vendor the cooking mats also, that jumps to 232c..... which is almost as much value add as skinning it would be (68c vs 77 for skinning).
---
It all adds up quickly. The difference between 1.6 silver per kill, and 2.3 silver per kill, can make a lot of difference. 
---
But it also lets you pick better grinding targets. Maybe you aren't going to grind raptors at all, and would rather grind something that drops no cooking mats but has a better loot table.
---
By actually trying to grind your own cooking mats, you get them like 5-7 levels out of date, but they also just cost you a lot more than fish. 
---
Fishing has the added advantage of you being able to use your mailbox as additional storage. If you fish your level 25 fish at level 15, that means that it can be cooked, and mailed to your bank alt, at level 15, which means it has had time to bounce off the bank alt and get sent back by level 20, so you can have 3 stacks of it sitting in your mailbox, not taking up bag space, just ready to take and eat as needed. You not only can't easily do that when you cook meat you hunt at the time, then you end up taking up additional space, as you often have space taken up for spice. With precooked fish, you only have to cook a little bit of meat 5 at a time every now and again for an out of date but still relevant food buff. 
---
It's really silly not to level, in order, fishing--&gt; cooking--&gt; character, unless you have no intention of ever leveling one of the first 2. Or you are honestly trying for some sort of leveling achievement.
---
I know you're aware of my answer, but it really wasn't balanced for this. The need to balance it may have been a piece of what brought us to where retail is.
---
That said, if it's something you find fun, you can make it happen. You just need to organize it. There is an arena in STV, and if I'm not mistaken, one outside of Dire Maul. You can arrange and build support for a community driven effort. No promises it goes well, but it should be possible.
---
That global launch baby!!!! Just hoping we can log in in under an hour.

The maniacal grin underneath that helmet is what I imagine all gnome warrior players look like when they stomp the giants of the horde mercilessly

Herb/alch is underrated for a first char, it's so easy and cheap to level and has a ton of utility during leveling plus at 60.

I have no doubt in my mind me and my group of casual plebs will eventually organize a tournament between us or 2 but between us we have 15-20 people playing (local game group) which is fun don't get me wrong and I hope more people on the server join but without blizzards help this goes south quick with the way the arenas work
---
But again it's not an option now is it. It's a two for one deal, even if you only like the one. You can accept it or not pay it
---
Dude that's a nice meme!
---
Do you really think Improved Mana Burn and Improved Inner Fire are bad?
---
See Old school AV was why I was so stoked for classic. I loved the epic day long battles there where summoning a boss and doing the collection turn in missions mattered. Unless I’m wrong I read we are getting the watered down “race” version though. Has me bummed. Really hoping I’m wrong. :(
---
Wow. This looks amazing. I never knew how much I needed this change
---
I get "You have been disconnected. (BLZ51901016)", I was previously in the stresstests.
---
100g???  If memory servers me right the mount itself only cost like 5 or 10 gold and the riding skill itself cost like 40 or 45 so the total was like 50 gold. 
---
And no 50 or 100 gold was NOT easy, with all the traveling, repairs, skills, reagents, and so on you had barely any gold by the time you reached level 60. And then you were hit by a flurry of extremely expensive skills .... I remember not being able to buy some of them. 
---
Again I am not sure what vanilla you are talking about but unless you got real lucky, got a BOE blue or Epic and actually knew to sell it on AH, money was tight while leveling.
---
&lt;People who actually played vanilla and are now streaming it on Twitch for tens of thousands of viewers&gt;: Yes this is fun just as I remember! I love this amazing game!
---
&lt;Their 18 year old viewers (since the beta started, the new majority of subscribers to this sub)&gt;: Wow that looks fun! 
---
&lt;People who have no interest in streamers, but have been longing for the game they loved back in 2004, waiting and following Vanilla news on this sub and elsewhere since ‘You think you do but you don’t.’&gt;: Yes, this will be amazing! Finally populated servers again! More diversity in the community! Bring back this truly special game!
---
&lt;18 year old twitch viewers&gt;: But what if we added in some features to make the game faster and better and cooler and upgraded the models!
---
&lt;Long time Vanilla fans thinking back to that last ‘cool new change’ that was finally the last straw before they quit - whether it was LFR, Garrisons, dailies, or something else&gt;: Hello darkness my old friend...
---
Haha that’s fantastic, I knew I would like the answer. Thank you for that
---
Having a pay wall isn't all bad.   
---
Even if there are a lot of downsides to a subscription based model, I like to think of it as a monthly entry fee into a gated community as I'd rather not have the masses play WoW. It isn't for everyone. With that said, I'm not anti-casual or against new players. I just tend to think having some barrier for entry, in this case $15/month, raises the bar of average quality players per server.
---
Thats right, you just need to pay for the riding training, which is like 1g or something stupid like that.
---
nice ty
---
Yes. But I think you should try them anyway. You'll learn why they're bad and why you might like to have them anyway for niche situations (like snipping mana in AV for example). Plus maybe you'll figure out a playstyle that they fit into.
---
Yeah!  Let's destroy world pvp!
---
On my stress test account with a WoW subscription, I get "No Realms Available". On my other account that never had access to the stress test and is without a WoW subscription, I get "No Realms Available" also.
---
Can’t say this enough. People out here looking for the best class to play. I’ve seen all classes destroy all classes. It’s all based on how well you are. When I was leveling my priest in TBC, I was 64 and was jumped by a 70 warrior. I destroyed him. No your class and know the other classes so you know what to use and when. Duals come in handy for this.
---
You can, you just need to actually try. If you start your Classic character Day 1 ESDF it will feel completely natural by lvl 60.  
---
 
---
Plus you get to keep your left hand on homerow so it's much better for typing as well.
---
not really
---
Can't wait to have queues in phase 2 :)
---
I don't like the ideas of *arenas* in classic, but I've always thought it would be cool if your group could duel another group.  So you could set up 3vs3 or 5vs5 duels, but put in the game world and not in a separate arena.
---
But speaking of arenas, the Gurabashi Arena on STV would let you kind of do this.
---
Makes me reconsider going human
---
No, you just mismanaged your gold
---
Is it actually no effect or just very little?
---
Why can't they just take it to Gurubashi Arena like everyone else?
---
Who asked if we are
---
Missing anything ?
---
That was actually pretty relaxing to watch.
---
&gt;Female dwarf rogue, 
---
No way, you have to go with female dwarf pally for those sick braid twirls.
---
Health regen is actually a joke.... It was the first documented occurrence of trolling.
---
Trolls are better for PVE (faster cast when you are healing ppls) 
---
Orc are better for PVP the 25% extra stun resist is very good.
---
Since you have no race preference, and don't intend to PvE often, than Orc or Tauren is what you should play.  
---
Orc stun resist, and Tauren war stomp are both powerful in PvP.
---
&gt; doesn’t want spoilers
---
&gt; goes on subreddit where there’s definitely gonna be spoilers
---
“wtf, spoilers!!”
---
Orc for pvp if that is what you will be focusing on.
---
I was going to make a Brexit joke but decided to leave it
---
If you level in Westfall. Collect Hops, Flasks of Oil and Murloc Fins (Need 8 for a quest in Redridge).
---
Does this character have a name in lore?
---
We have a "responsible PTO" policy, which basically means unlimited PTO.  But now it's awkward because if I'm being honest to myself, I'm not sure it's "responsible" lol.
---
I never played original vanilla, how can you claim that? there was no GOLD to manage, while leveling you were managing your silvers.
---
The amount of mental gymnastics you are doing to keep your ego intact is hilariously pathetic.
---
The funniest part is you actually think your arguments based on complete misinformation are anything more than nonsensical garbage spawned from hurt feelings.
---
I mean really when you ended your statement with "layered" was actually priceless.
---
I couldn't dream of painting you out to be a bigger clown than you have presented yourself to be.
---
You have been wrong at every step and you have doubled down at every step. It's nothing short of sad.
---
Move along now.
---
ITT: Everyone talking about Sword Specialization not realizing that the best leveling spec doesn’t have you put a single point in it until level 58.
---
Use whatever weapons you have.
---
That sounds greif as fuck. Can totally see it though. If you want that big dick, that's what the early bird gets.
---
The big dick gets the early bird worm
---
Dude I had 5g by level 20
---
Playing vanilla casually is no problem at all man. It's the most complete wow experience. You can just get lost questing and when you finally hit 60 it's not like the raids aren't any difficult until aq anyhow. Play the game at your pace. We're all old men now lol can't be  playing for 16 hours straight, go to bed wake up and do it all over again. 
---
I'm with you though im playing on a private and got completely lost in the memories. Problem is now I get hit with the memories of level 60s camping the contested areas lol.
---
Zul'Farrak and Stratholme
---
It definitely will be. A lot of people on this subreddit are hardcore min maxxers it seems like, but they don't realize that for the majority of players, the edginess of the undead rogue is impossible to resist, especially for teens.
---
Tauren baby go mulgor for leveling and run on those vast plains.
---
Don't tie gear or honor to it and don't try to balance around it and i think it would be fine. 
---
However if we start letting some changes they might make to many so I'm going to say #nochanges
---
I wish they just had a slider or check box for old/new textures.
---
You came in too hot man. I’m honestly not sure why you posted “your opinion” in the first place. You’ve played pservers, but didn’t know that a classic subreddit exists?. It seems mighty trollish.
---
Nah man. Ion said it at blizcon. They want to recreate private servers as they were back then.
---
Totally agree with you!
---
Okay, interesting. Follow up question, did you play a lot in the stress test(s)? Did you get level 10?
---
Yes, and then at level 20 you had to get skills that would cost you 4 of those gold. And that was the story for every two levels. Have you actually leveled a level 60 on original vanilla? 
---
I mean you can see streamers and now much ppl value 5-10 gold ..... and they are level 30s with nothing to do but farm. Just think about that.
---
Orc PvP masterrace. War Stomp is nice, but if were talking PvP specs, every class has a stun except Shaman and Warlock. War Stomp is a good interrupt on occasion and AoE stun on flag caps, but on the whole in group healing and 1v1s Hardiness is very strong. Troll dont really get you anything in PvP and very very little in raiding as a healer unless its a fight where theres repositioning and even then, very little.
---
If someone could make this for warlock (sm/ruin pref) or link me to one that is already made, that would be amazing :D at this rate I was planning on just trying to max rank everything cuz idk lol
---
Honestly wish we’d be given the choice to turn on a setting which allows the user to see the new models as opposed to the original. It’s currently in BFA (at least the last time I played, it was), but reversed. I personally don’t like the old models at all.
---
The cost was 100g, 90g revered 80g exalted
---
The first line I completely agree with. I think it would interfer with how the game functions if you could even get honor from the kills. I think balancing around it would make it even worse too because then there becomes super optimal comps and tier lists and it just seems better if its not balanced and everything can be countered by so many other things with the way the balance is currently  
---
Your second statement was just slippery slope though
---
$15 for access to Classic and Retail is a great deal. This is to also prevent their games being literally split into 2 communities.  
---
This way, during downtime, you can just play the other game.  
---
Also $15 is the price of a lunch. Insignificant.
---
boy, you on the wrong side of town
---
I LOVE THIS that style yo 👍👍👍
---
The addition of WSG destroyed world pvp and you know it. The highlands became a ghost town the 2nd it was released.
---
Sure so basically you think the 1.12 Meta has both Druid and Warrior main tanks when in reality it’s only Warrior main tanks with sometimes Druid off tanks. Take care
---
It looks like it's missing the [ST priest quest](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8257)
---
Blizzard bundled Classic into Retail because they eventually want to find a way to convert Classic players over to Retail.
---
Microtransactions are over half their revenue. Classic has none, Retail has so many.
---
I would pay so much money for this
---
I never knew this! But the meme is from wow, right?
---
It was in the tbc prepatch.   
---
It had no rating or anything it was just for fun.  And I would be ok with this.
---
I haven't been wrong at all. You're the only one doing gymnastics.
---
Was he banned?
---
Did he visited the ToS?
---
Was he griefing?
---
I don't understand where you can't see that you're the only one doubling down, you haven't even made a single retort to any of my points other than "Your wrong".
---
Anything else you've said has literally proven my point correct.
---
End of discussion.
---
If you do it enough you'll get used to it. It's like when people use more "optimal" keyboard layouts (don't do this cause it'll ruin qwerty for you)
---
Wow no one has made this exact same joke
---
The addition of WSG destroyed world pvp and you know it. The highlands became a ghost town the second it was released.
---
Woosh as fuck
---
One of those things done for flavor or RP but wasn't really fair gameplay wise with how stingy reputation gains were back at the start.
---
Sure, the dwarves look amazing but the list of those that don't is longer. Human females, gnome females, night elves of both genders, and then there's the animations. Tauren look like stuffed animals.
---
Jokes on you, everyone else took 2 weeks off
---
That's what I'm going.  Forced to go ally because of friends.
---
Stoneform is good but so is Perception in rogue v rogue.  Also, every time I end up using swords I would be wishing I'd have gone human.
---
Ya I really think orc is the clear winner on paper but I just can't decide if that is what I value most. I'll be staring at this guy for so many hours.
---
Not lev10, but i played multiple characters the "second day" of both stresstests (spent the stress launch stuck in login for hours before going to bed). Probably around 10 hours gametime + whatever hours it took sitting trying to login.
---
Yeah, thats pretty much how it goes. I think theres always a chance a report system will be abused, but if you're being reported a lot you're probably doing something to earn it.
---
But they have to look like pixeled polygons
---
Thank you for the detailed response! So, it does seem like "You have been disconnected" is a more rare response. Still not enough information to say whether it's just another error or means anything.
---
It's just missing Bonzi Buddy and the Ask Jeeves toolbar
---
You must have only played on private servers...
---
Ya the hard party is convincing people to travel that far out. 1000g was hard to earn so very few people had epic mounts. Traveling the world for a few duels that might get interrupted by  literally anyone who might show up was a lot to ask.
---
Same, I did a lot of both of those things and struggled to 10. Let's see if we get many others who are in our same situation.
---
I tried the same thing but idk it doesn't even feel the same as the stress test did. Playing warrior already felt rough and then I get on a pserver and I'm dodged/miss/parried every other attack it feels like and have less health regen and rage gen. 
---
It's no wonder people talk about how hard warrior leveling is, a lot of them probably played pservers where the difficulty seems to be artificially increased.
---
Trolls just oom faster and they have ugly feet.  Orc master race with sweet stun resist.
---
Jesus fucking christ
---
You should just became a popular streamer. I heard that the best way
---
I’d much rather have sharding than wait over an hour to play the game
---
Orc gives you stun resist. Great for PvP.
---
Tauren gives health and war stomp, great for PvE and PvP.
---
Troll gives health Regen and Beserking awesome for PvP and good for PvE.
---
Faster attacks = more Windfury and weapon procs.
---
I got zinrhok on my hunter, but there were no melee who needed it so thats how i got it
---
That's not true at all. 95% of us are fine with paladins of any spec. As long as they're healing.
---
Trolls health Regen isn't to be overlooked and neither should their Beserking talent for PvP. Faster attack = more procs.
---
Trolls master race.
---
I've never seen anyone redraw this as realistically and as close to detail as you have. Well done!
---
Bind WASD to abilities and double click move is master race ofc
---
I understand that 100%, you might be the majority, but the subscription gives access to both classic and modern.
---
Not telling you to go play BFA, but there is a reason both are offered under the same sub :)
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/global-ignore-list
---
This isn't a realm-wide reputation addon, but I don't think you want that. It would be too easy to abuse.
---
Shaping up nicely, my dudes :)
---
If you’ve still got the original disks there’s no harm in putting the key in!!
---
No, I only bought the skill if I needed it. And it cost 36 silver
---
It’d be even cooler if they released the four friggin’ disks it took to download it back then too lmao
---
That’s movie CGI, not unreal
---
Looks legit. Titan bar check
---
lol I have no many good memories of Duskwood, I played a warrior and I was legitimately terrified of leaving the roads. I also remember seeing Stitches for the first time and I petrified at the thought of fighting him. That zone was so immersive to me, Ill never forget it.
---
It was a random example to show a point
---
The last I heard about right click report like this, it got you silenced, which is a new penalty introduced in WoD or thereabouts. It was their lenient alternative to going from zero-to-banned, a sort of in-between. I assume it's still in use today and wouldn't be surprised to see it appear in Classic. I suspect that is the "human element" Blizz refers to--auto squelch and auto silence are reviewed by a staff member and overturned or upheld as deemed fit.
---
Pm’d
---
It's the strongest tank and best melee DPS. Why are you surprised that people want to play the only viable hybrid in the game?
---
I have never touched a private server in my life.
---
Who's the tank?
---
I have absolutely no hard evidence. I just suspect that the increase in levels, server down time and announcement for recommencement on Thursday might be accompanied with additional invites. It's hopeful thinking, but the difference in login errors between accounts has me suspicious. That's why I'm doing more research, for fun!
---
I did skip it until warlords was about to come out. I rejoined and then warlords became too much to handle with no guild and so much to do. 
---
I can’t wait but I will. Hopefully classic is as good as I hope for it to be! As we all hope it to be!
---
Oh god it looks hideous.
---
If it helps for bug testing though, then its a good thing. I just don't want to see it later.
---
"That sucks, try making your own group!"
---
I'd bet gold that would word for word be the ticket response.
---

---
The op says he is going sword spec.... but wanted to know if a dagger was better for offhand. The answer is no, a sword is better if you go sword spec.
---
&gt;your primary goal leveling is going to be leveling more efficiently.
---
That's just wrong. The primary goal of leveling is the same as the primary goal of the rest of the game, which is to have fun.
---
Ty Blizz
---
&gt;We have figured out what specs are viable and anyone not running said spec will not be taken seriously or considered.
---
This really only applies to a % of a % of guilds, though. Most raids will be taking who is available.
---
Oh excellent! Yeah it just looks bad to me personally, but I'm glad it's in for testing though.
---
No. Surprisingly no one was ever mean to another person back in 2004-06. Everyone was actually super friendly and kind.
---
I believe so. There's a [Know Your Meme page](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kek) for it that explains more.
---
An idiot and a bigot. Thats rare /s. Wrong on all fronts nice try though kid.
---
It's the opposite for streamers. They are spending gold like nothing because they are level capped and getting gold for XP from quests. Asmongold drops 10g on items a day, and ultimately it will be deleted so they dont care to hoard gold
---
Ah, Davvve.
---
People have been dicks in every online game since the inception of online gaming. Classic wow was no different. The only thing is that if you were a dickhead you would be known on the server as a dickhead and be treated as such.
---
Plenty of people were dicks in vanilla.  I’ll admit I quit in WoDso maybe my view was outdated but I think just as many people were dicks then as in vanilla.
---
The main difference was people who are quiet and keep their head down.  I feel like half of the people who do that in modern wow were friendly and outgoing in vanilla.  Sure you had plenty of quiet reserved people too so not all but a good number.
---
I think the biggest change was the decrease in good interactions not the increase in bad ones.
---
That's his baby monitor
---
I left WoW played FFXI and FFXIV and they were always super friendly. I came back to WoW and was like, OK. :/
---
If you're not planning to min max go for what ever feels best for You. Im likely going troll shaman for classic. Orc and tauren are both better at pvp but w/e
---
No one will peel women for you like, WoW. A real bro.
---
This is Robert baratheons nightmare
---
Never once did I experience someone not being super duper nice all the time in vanilla. People were always nice, if you wiped a group or raid, they would congratulate you on learning how mechanics work and thank you for introducing them to how valuable gold is by wiping them.
---
Sadly yes there have always been assholes. It's exacerbated in classic because there weren't time limits  in  BGs. One shitty person could make a WSG last for hours. However as long as you aren't actually one of those people, the assholes are just a loud minority.
---
"It's a big club and you ain't in it"
---
-George Carlin
---
You can weave some in if you are grab the relevant quests while you're leveling and it can end up being quite xp efficient. For instance, the long defias quest chain yields a lot of xp overall and if you grab all the deadmines quests while leveling it ends up being more efficient, assuming you can quickly find a group while you're still in the right level bracket.
---
Their both bad from a standard dps perspective. Their only use at 60 is in spellpower/proc builds which depend a lot on things with mechanics that are pretty fuzzy so it's impossible to tell if they'll be a thing yet on Classic.
---
I don’t think you can make alts even if you wanted to.  I could be wrong but that functionality was added later than 1.12.  Someone correct me if I’m wrong.
---
Yeah it’s crazy. It was like 2007 hit and people just changed, man.
---
People have always been dicks, but Id assume its going to be worse nowadays.
---
Nice if you only play wow, but if not the  you have to change the defaults of every game you play, or ever will play.
---
Both Fiery and Lifesteal had ~6PPM. That means the proc rate percentage will depend on your weapon speed and class.
---
Lifesteal scales with spell power and debuffs, Fiery does not.
---
You sort of have that now. There's a "Classic" setting under Graphics. It cranks your Graphics Quality down to 3 of 10. The most notable changes is the water when you do this. It goes from that static "scrambled porn" look to a smooth watery texture with ripple effects. 
---
I think Classic might have been better served with an updated graphics look, but whatever.
---
Looks good
---
Yea, hands down my favorite zone in the entire game. The music, the atmosphere, the quests. Exactly right about leaving the road. It was one of the first times where I dreaded leaving the road.
---
Oh I hope you are playing Classic and what realm are you on? lol
---
Ahh, be confident in it and others will too. If I happen to find myself on a server where something like this was happening, I'd probably take part. I don't think it should require blizzard intervention though, outside of creating another "arena" zone or something.  Also, with proper brackets to favor AvH, you can accomplish most of the rounds anywhere in the world.
---
Make it like fight club, you need to know someone to get in.
---
... doesn't change the fact that no one mentioned he shouldn't be putting a single point in Sword Spec until level 58.
---
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!!
---
I understand that. I'm just stating that I had a preference to be holy spec while leveling my first priest. Sure, it took longer but I had a better time of it because I made a ton of friends.
---
At this point are they just going to let people play the full game from 1-60? Shouldn't betas have a limit?
---
I’m a dark-cloud power bottom gamer. I go all the fuck in when I find something I like to play and, as much as I want to play, I know it'll be better to save all of this pent up energy for the official release.
---
Anime is saving me from myself.
---
I love this idea! Thanks for sharing.
---
Mine wanted to remind me how cool hearthstone is. To bad there isn't a way to tell them i hate card games and that is the only one of their games i refuse to play.
---
I was the same way, leveled all the way to 60 with my PVP trinket.  Sub rogue here, ran crippling/instant myself.  But when I was stalking players I'd change my poison to the situation before I opened. 
---
Did wound come out in BC?  I used to MH wound and OF crippling once we got that sweet Shiv.
---
I'm basically arguing with myself which I want to do. I can't keep a schedule to raid hardcore but it goes against my nature to not optimize. Still thinking though just wanted opinions so thanks.
---
It would be a completely boneheaded move for Blizzard to have two different subscriptions, so no, it's fine.
---
&gt;I haven't been wrong at all
---
You're kidding yourself. Your entire argument was predicated on misinformation.
---
&gt;As far as I can tell from everything I've Sen and read no action was taken
---
&gt;Was he griefing
---
Yes. Without question and unequivocally Trollgodx was griefing. That determination was ultimately made by Blizzard and *action* was taken against the player. 
---
You are fundamentally wrong and you are futily defending a weak position.
---
You have done nothing more than to prove how inept you are and how far you are willing to go to protect a position that is held in bad faith.
---
You are pathetic and it's hilarious.
---
There were twinks who were twice as worse than what you described
---
post it up then big man lets see
---
Short answer, yes
---
Long answer, yeeeeeeeessssssss
---
Maxed professions too.
---
Sadly, Winterspring is some of the worst leveling efficiency in the game on your way to 60 but there's also no better option.
---
Distracting shot is too important if you want to do dungeons.
---
Viper sting is too important if you want to PvP.
---
Mend pet is just really good and an efficient way to heal your pet.  I can't imagine skipping it while leveling.  
---
I think immolation trap is also good while leveling.  Would not go to trainer specifically to train a level in serpent sting or raptor strike though.
---
Yes, that place is great for world pvp too
---
That's a very min-max perspective for just leveling. You get very little reward from doing it and if you enjoy sword spec then its better to do that.
---
No 1 person couldnt hold 19 others hostage by not turning in the flag. It required the whole team effort to keep him alive.
---
If his team was so upset at prolonging the game theyd let him die
---
I’d play the ever loving shit out of that.
---
Shadow is faster but not by much. Large misconception. Until 40 its slower.
---
Free Golden Legendary!
---
...that you can’t disenchant -_-
---
yeah plenty of turbo tryhard salty boys. only its worse because youre stuck with your server
---
Always orc
---
I can't talk about beta but in the stress test your quest XP was turned into gold so at 40 they could earn gold crazy fast
---
Call it 5 second rule :P
---
I hate what they did to orc facial hair on the new models.
---
Tauren because totems fit them better thematically
---
Pretty sure that is Savix in the first screenshot. He does this all the time. The other day he was streaming from a nice luxury living room.
---
No it was just you guys. Blizzard hates you.
---
Some look absolutely horrible because they completely take away the cartoon aesthetic and it looks nothing like WoW. Most of the Human villages for instance, they look like absolute garbage. The pixels and textures aren't bad, but they would look disgusting in WoW and nothing like the actual places.
---
Orgrimmar kinda looks like a balance of the cartoon WoW aesthetic and the realism that you get with what I am assuming is unreal engine in all of these? Northshire Abbey and Shadowglen are probably the best looking ones since they keep the WoW aesthetic but pump up the quality at the same time.
---
Obviously Iron Forge looks the best period, but I doubt the average PC would be able to realistically run that in real time, plus it's so far out it might look unrealistic and bad up close, hard to say.
---
Love seeing all this work come together. The dev team is doing an awesome job.
---
A batch is all the player interactions within a 200 ms window.  So anything that happens (damage, cc, healing, etc.) from the moment it resets to 1 to 199 will all actually happen once it hits 200.
---
The example you used with fear and sheep could look like this:
---
-fear ends cast at 15ms into batch
---
-sheep ends cast at 187ms into batch
---
-both spells go into effect at 200
---
The real shitty occurrence is with healing.  You’ll hear a healer shout “my heal went off!” Even though the tank is now dead. Example:
---
-tank is at 10 health going into batch
---
-tank hit for 20
---
-tank healed for 30
---
-200 hits, everything goes into effect, tank is dead and heal fails because he died within the batch.
---
You’d need to heal prior to a “kill batch” in order for a tank to successfully survive.
---
\#saltyboys Love it. :-)
---
There's nothing to "enjoy" about Sword Spec while leveling. It doesn't change your rotation or playstyle, it adds no flavor, it's just straight numbers and sword spec is awful numbers while leveling.
---
Going for Improved SND and Relentless Strikes after AR does have an impact on rotation and playstyle and 5/5 Lethality will be better numbers.
---
Immolate for an example had a diff animation. Polymorph used the same one. It adds so much flavor to spellcasting as an undead. It still irritates the hell out of me they got rid of it
---
Thanks to you had to take a trip down the memory lane via patch notes. Se yeah in patch 1.3 they significantly reduced the costs of all skills "Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased."
---
I played pre 1.12 when you actually had to buy separate riding skills, used reagents on buffs and had no Cross-Realm BGs. 
---
Non the less time will tell but I assure you will see plenty of level 40s running around with no mounts.
---
You've saved by the level cap increase.
---
At the cost of another year? No thanks, we're already dying from the hype as is. I agree they should have launched with a graphical update though, so they should have just not told us about it so soon and did that first. 
---
BFA, as garbage as it is system-wise and mechanically, has some absolutely beautiful models and textures on some things. Unrelated, but interesting physics on things too. It's not cutting edge stuff, but it's so stylized and beautiful that it's better looking than 90% of the higher texture/poly count modern games out there atm.
---
I also met up with a girl I used to level with. Vanilla was something special. She lived in Atlanta, and I lived on the Carolina line. Was an awesome time in my life.
---
Hope you enjoy white swings.

yea yea yea yea yea

Back in the PVP grinding days I (Orc rog) spent most my time in WSG defending flag room and AB Blacksmith with a good hunter (Troll) friend.  We were a force to be reckoned coordinating all the CC's and stuns.  I highly recommend it if you're teaming with a buddy.
---
Yeah, the nelf females took a pounding.
---
They should have released Classic with this Remastered version.  Would have been so Epic to re-explore Classic in 4k.
---
The good ol’ days
---
They probably want to test it all.  10+ million people have done the content before, it's not giving anything away
---
That’s not a baby!

I think my computer just burst into flames.

yes please! i'm a big fan of Schism.  
---
I'm not sure who intends to fix their UI's for classic so if you're willing/able to then that's great for the community :D
---
fake post
---
Ok you win. Fun is only effected by numbers. It has nothing to do with how people see themselves and their character. You are absolutely right.
---
Everyone is going skinning and mining.
---
I would not play Ret as paladin unless you no life it and get all the top gear. Everyone will try and push you  to go healing
---
This this! I've always wanted an add-on that takes a screenshot and my played when leveling up. Tyvm!!
---
What the fuck mate
---
Hard to quantify. Dungeons like WC and RFK may not be equivalent xp/hr to questing but the rewards can be significant enough to speed up your leveling following. This is a little less relevant for priests as the wand is the only thing that really matters.
---
There should be heaps of people looking to do dungeons initially so I wouldn't worry about setup time so much. Group breakdown is a real risk but I think the older average age and the nature of classic will make it less likely
---
Hmmmm. What?
---
Look at the cute little chubby cheeks. Thats a dancing baby
---
There were jerks then too.
---
To be "solved" it has to be possible to know both what the theoretically best move by both parties in every situation is, as well as the result of the game if those moves are made. The fact that either one side doesn't win every game due to the game being solved as favorable for one or drawn every game due to the game being solved to a draw means that chess is not solved. Tic-tac-toe is a solved game because given any board state, it's possible to state what the best play is for either side and calculate to the end of the game. It happens to be solved to a draw from the start of the game.

---
What type of dungeon?
---
Not really, but I didn't play with pug premades.   I could imagine that might be quite bad.
---
Made a trial account on NA (switching from EU to play with friends) to get ready for Classic, so I might buy a month and then farm tokens before Classic lands.
---
You got a few sarcastic posts so I'll preface that this is not such a post: 
---
There was very, very little trash talking in dungeons on my server. When one person was struggling there was a cohesive thing that, because we were all committed, feedback was given with the intent to help them improve *and* taken by the struggling party with grace. 
---
Contrast that to what I saw in Cata where people who struggled were vote-kicked and, if you tried to help them (god help me I tried) they would more often than not take it personally and say rude things in response. Very different vibes between my two WoW eras. 
---
Battlegrounds in Vanilla had a much snippier tone, with the occasional folks being extremely critical in the masturbatory sense (without intent to help anybody improve but merely to satisfy themselves). I don't feel like those got worse in Cata and I'd speculate that this is because auto-queue systems a.) make some people act like this and b.) discourage most other people from putting in the energy to socialize.
---
prot warrior is probably the most in-demand thing in the entire game
---
[Coarse Gorilla Hair] is my favorite grey item in the game.
---
Okay that is funny because it is like i said above for me. Didn't matter if I pop ZG trinket or not, spell dmg eq or not, dmg was the same. Scorch increased the fiery weapon dmg, curse and shadowweaving lifesteal for example.
---
Yes
---
Cosmetics in video games is a trillion dollar a year business. People will pay a shit ton of money to look the way they want. Op did not ask which spec was the best. Op said they were going sword spec. You shouting "your dumb for going sword spec" doesn't answer ops question.
---
For what it’s worth, one of my contacts at Blizzard told me he thought there was another wave coming out soon. He doesn’t work directly on the WoW team though so IDK.
---
Fun for PvP, frustrating for PvE for everyone involved unless you're in a guild that doesn't care about min/maxxing
---
This would be AWESOME!!
---
Slippery slope is real in WoW's history and in many other facets of society. What makes you dismiss it?
---
Wasnt it just to buy some materials for crafting and turn them in?
---
Each Wing Clip rank is 10% more slow so I would consider getting Rank 2 while leveling if you PVP a lot
---
that's an interesting take
---
It *is* too steep for a 15 year old game, but people here would give their first-born child to play. Nowhere else has anyone done this with ported games. Want the original Pokemon Blue on your 3DS? Buy it for 10 bucks. There are tons of classic games out there re-released for a fraction of what they originally went for, even if the developers took the time out to port the game to a new system. In essence, this is what Blizzard is doing with Classic WoW. It's a port. That people are willing to pay $15 bucks a month for. Yes, there should be a separate subscription for Classic because yes they will need a bit of money for server upkeep, but certainly not $15 bucks worth else Blizzard wouldn't have made it free for retail players. It's bundled to force those who only want to play Classic to pay more than they should be and it's Blizz being greedy while their fanbase encourages them.
---
Dude, I didn't know specifically this existed but I know how Reddit works and could have assumed there's one. That doesn't mean I go to everyone of everything I like. Look at my history, I do one thing on here mostly. I happened to be searching all top of the hour and found this. I happen to play wow. And I just happened to give my opinion and now I know not to come back here where everyone takes things so seriously. I don't care about votes I care when people don't understand what I'm trying to say. The last thing I want to do is waste my time by stirring up drama. This is key example of why I've stopped using Reddit as much.
---
Don’t forget all the assholes in barrens chat and Elwin forest lol. Otherwise you’re pretty spot on.
---
&gt; flat Korean mmo world
---
Strange this does sum up a lot of the other MMOs i tried over the years. I had always thought it was because i didn't care about the story in them ( as much as I loved WC story)
---
So if I was pulling slower than optimal but keeping aggro would people be more willing to put up with that. I have a fairly decent understanding on how to tank but lack the knowledge of what my class was fully capable of.
---
Thank you! Hmmm, it may just be something.

Great sign that that are still listening to feedback and making changes.

I put Fiery on my Sul Thraze the Lasher on my 52 warrior and killed a rank 10 level 60 warrior one time. So it's basically BIS enchant as far as I'm concerned.
---
God damn TIL...
---
Yeah I'd say so if you get it vs not getting it at 60 and still needing to farm it out
---
Great read, that sheep story is hilarious.
---
I think this is one possibility. The three points in Improved Revenge can also just go into +Armor by preference.

Just roll horde. Fuck the alliance.
---
damn it all to hell
---
Sword Spec is not a cosmetic choice.
---
And there was nothing in OPs post to suggest *when* he was going Sword Spec. He could very well mean to follow the best methods and only pick it up at 58.
---
I didn't say OP was dumb, I said you were dumb.
---
There is no Crusader strike or Avenging Wrath. It's all auto attack and Seal of Command
---
I mean, I'm with you in spirit, buddy, but Blizzard might as well be Jon Snow because they know fucking nothing. Even the original WoW dev team admitted they had no fucking idea what they were doing. They were just trying shit and hoping it worked, this turned out great for those games because of luck and the fact we had no standards, expectations or goals back then as gamers for those types of games. 
---
Companies won't take these risks anymore though, and they don't have to. The gaming market is so fucking huge, they will always find their playerbase simply by playing on the research and psychology of gamers they have collected over the years. We love to bitch about lootboxes, but everyone keeps buying the fucking things, so obviously as a whole, we love them, no matter how much some of us individually hates them. 
---
This kinda shit is how BFA came to be. We all congregate in places like this to have an echo chamber of how much we hate it, but someone is playing it, and they are making a lot of money still. It's not peak Wrath, but it's better than literally ANY of their competition, so they don't really give a shit.
---
The only reason we got Classic is because so many people demanded it and are playing the private servers. It was relatively easy to put a few coders on reversing the code and downgrading WoW back to classic. It cost them very little money and will net them a lot of subs for no new content creation. That's why we got Classic, not because it was a calculated risk or a brilliant idea they had. They don't do those or have those anymore.
---
Part of me wishes too, but the other part already knows.
---
This matches mostly what I do too, with more reliance on mouse buttons/scroll with modifiers. Surprised your approach to r though. I also like it for reply but why not do alt+r for reply so you can get more impactful abilities on such a close key.
---
That already happened in the forum thread suggesting it, people were flipping out on the dude
---
To be honest, early on battle shout should be enough to keep agro.
---
Your initial pull should look like:
---
Shoot main target with ranged attack -&gt; blood rage -&gt; battle shout -&gt; demo shout -&gt; revenges &amp; sunder tab target. Refresh demo as needed.
---
One other tidbit. If someone in your group agros a bunch of other mobs, just hit battleshout and let them come to you.
---
i mean sure? prot warrior is objectively the best tank in vanilla, plenty of guides out there, its more complicated than in retail tho cuz of the stance dance

I recommend this 100% if you have wrist issues.
---
There is no such thing as chain fast pulling in vanilla
---
Unless you overgear/overlevel the dungeon
---
Yes. You would do the runs anyway. Might as well get the gear!
---
I’ve definitely needed something like this when playing a new character or class and it’s not usually until 60 that I’ll start hiding entire bars or move to weakauras.
---
&gt; why do anything If I'm just going to die.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Is this a meme or something I'm missing? The new models all look good, it's probably the only decent thing in BFA. Are there actually people out there who prefer looking at FF7 block textures?
---
Don't worry about speed. More often than not, it's going to be you who will be waiting on healers/dps to drink up between pulls. While they are drinking, you can take your time to plan out the next pull and prep for it.
---
well theres your problem
---
I literally mean, they didnt have nice hills and mountains, just flat fields with roads. Wow has terrain depth.   
---
Terrain and Lord of the Rings style archetypes is all you need, but god damn if game devs dont get it.
---
Pretty sure, yeah.  But maybe not the *very* start of the starting area.  Like I think undead had some early unique quests that only undead could do.
---
People on the internet are likely to be dicks yes
---
Absolutely! One thing about your example specifically, use the tram in iron forge to get to stormwind. Will save a ton of time as opposed to walking through some other zones.
---
Yeah I always wondered why they disabled the banking/diving movement of the flightpaths. Or if it was another unintended change they just never felt like reverting, like so many other possible changes.
---
Woah I don’t remember gryphons ever flying that low. Very cool.

Look up "MadSeasonShow Classic Profession Guide" on YouTube and he basically goes down the list of what is for what and what's the most beneficial for certain things.

Hey man!  
---
Schizm was an alliance guild, pretty notorious, especially early on for pvp shenanigans.  
---
I played a Horde Druid in a top guild.  You and I probably did battle at some point.  Crazy small world.
---
You're not subbed and cannot get an invite. Why do you care if a box is checked or not?
---
Yes, as long as that area has the class trainer that you're going. If you're making a dwarf hunter stay there or else you'll have to travel back to Ironforge just to train skills.
---
There will be an add on.
---
Depending on your reputation level you would also lose any reputation based discounts.

---
**Oceanic // Horde // PvP // Semi-Hardcore**
---
 **Who we are**
---
Bunch of Aussie lads who have been playing WoW since Classic. Many of us have been both Guild leaders and raid leaders in this time. The best way to explain the type of environment you will be joining, is a group of Aussies who are chill to talk to and hard to offend.
---
**What we do**
---
Firstly we will be semi-hardcore raiding. We won't be raiding 12 hours a day everyday, but when raid time comes you will be expected to take it seriously. World PvP is a big yes. Raid groups will be formed to push Alliance shit back in. We will also be ruining streamer events on both Alliance and Horde. If a streamer is doing an event on the server and the guild is not busy we will be fucking with them. If your online you will be expected to attend these large scale stream sniping sessions. Put simply we will be active in all forms of content available in classic.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
We will be heading into MC around the end of week two with the people who have hit 60. If enough have hit 60 we will kill bosses, if not we will farm trash mobs for T1 Belts and Bracers. In week 3 the raid schedule will look like this.
---
Wednesday: 8pm-12pm AEST
---
Friday: 8pm-12am AEST (TBD)
---
Saturday 8pm-12am AEST (TBD)
---
**Loot Distribution**
---
We will be using Loot council. Here is a quick explanation for anyone who has not used it before.
---
Loot council is a relatively simple way to distribute loot. Whenever an item is involved in the loot system, a group of individuals decides who gets the item. Ideally, this group of individuals takes into consideration several different factors, ranging from attendance, performance, size of upgrade, and attitude. It's worth noting that Loot Council systems are the most popular method of loot distribution in world-class raiding guilds.
---
**Recruitment**
---
We are recruiting everyone and everything at the moment (Other than Main Tank). From those who want to no-life it, to those who want to play casually. You can play whatever you want class or spec and the guild will take you. But if you want to raid you will be expected to play the spec that the guild wants you to.

Sure, daggers and swords have the same 3d models and the same animations. People also don't have personal life experiences which might make one seem cooler or more bad ass to them.  You are correct in all of the above.
---
Also you kill your own argument with the 2nd half of that comment. If op did in fact neglect to tell us they plan to follow the best practice and only want information for 58-60 then we are all still correct in tell him Sword offhand is best. 
---
I also don't think op is dumb but i think your a dumbass for think the 1% benefit is worth not playing what you want to play.
---
Upvoted for the incredibly accurate reproduction of original Vanilla graphics.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but there's more to tanking than holding aggro such as mob positioning, proactive use of cooldowns, interrupting right spell, performing boss mechanics. And blizzard decided to focus on these aspects rather than aggro holding which imo is necessary for the dps system on live. It would be stupid to have nice flashy proccy rotation when you need to slow your dps down every other second cuz aggro. 
---
As for healing, managing resources got irrelevant in favour of reflexive heals, complex boss mechanics etc. I actually find slow paced healing with focus on resource management to be more fun (last time I had fun healing was MoP and best time was early cataclysm).
---
FFXI did long ago... I really miss that type of dangerous wilderness. Losing 1/3rd of a level and de-leveling was so brutal, lol
---
It's free advertising, purely a business decision disguised as testing.
---
But I think it's a good one. Having these streamers organize these events on the beta is helping Blizzard prepare for the mass amount of players and without these streamers pushing the limits of the server and leading the charge then blizzard would have more work and testing to do during offical launch.
---
Oh the all nighters and cranking up our volume to hear if we sold anything from the AH when we finally slept

Someone mentioned recovering photos from an old Photo-bucket account, so I thought I would go look for my own old account.
---
I found this gem among a few other wow photos.
---
To set the scene: My Parents and Sister had taken off on Holidays, I had 5 days off work and Burning Crusade was just released, I was so excited to finally be able to play a shaman (I hate the look of the horde back then) and I think I was bragging to a mate about my "setup" for the week.
---
So there I was, laptop "borrowed" from work, access to the Lounge room, Dads new $5000 TV, my sippy cup full of Mountain dew and no distractions for 5 whole days, pretty sure I only slept for 3-4 hours a night for a week straight.
---
Things I thought I'd never hear for 1000, Alex.
---
I'll check.
---
&gt; At the cost of another year?
---
They had to backwards engineer the game since they no longer had the old client. They could have just started with the updated models and gone from there. 
---
&gt; BFA, as garbage as it is system-wise and mechanically
---
Lol
---
&gt; Unrelated, but interesting physics on things too
---
That is in classic. Grass moves and shifts when you walk past it. Water has realistic ripple effects when you swim or jump. 
---
&gt; It's not cutting edge stuff, but it's so stylized and beautiful that it's better looking than 90% of the higher texture/poly count modern games out there atm.
---
Unfortunately I think Blizzard saw the feedback and decided that any changes, no matter how slight, would cause this player base to lose their shit. 
---
They already are losing their shit over small stuff.
---
Yup that’s it’s exactly the thinking! It buffs other players (and hunter/locks pets) so it generates threat each time it’s applied provided they are all in range of the shout,
---
Reality is often disappointing

Who?

Do the beta testers get to keep their characters when the official servers are released? Or do they have to create new ones with the rest of us?

Summary:
---
The premium non-hardcore WoW experience. This guild is targeted towards stable adults and is designed to fit well with a standard working-person's routine. We want members whose schedule fits so they will want to stay with a balanced community long term. The leadership will strive to be transparent, fair, and do what they can to make our plans and goals a reality.
---
The Four Tenants:
---
1. Enjoy What you do and Who you do it with: Having fun is more important than enduring the pressure of raiding most nights. We will focus on building a strong, drama-free community of gamers.
---
2. Excellence at what you do: Strive to be among the best for the limited time we have
---
3. Make the most of y(our) time: We will find creative ways to be efficient, and members will respect the groups' time by being prepared to the extent that is possible. Planning and organizing will carry this very far as long as people meet expectations.
---
4. Balance: We will go at our own pace, not raid -too- much, and respect everyone's need to be a responsible adult outside of the game!
---
Raid Details: 
---
Everyone will want to experience as much of raiding content as possible. I would like to give everyone the opportunity to experience what is possible to clear in this type of guild.
---
Schedule: Main 40 man scheduled raids will have a 3-4 night per week schedule, based on a survey of the guild's availability a few weeks before the first raid.
---
Progress: The key here is to go at our own pace and not compare ourselves to hardcore guilds. As long as progress is made and people work on their characters when they can, we will clear content and possibly all of it, eventually. Content release schedule will be longer-tailed, and raids do not become irrelevant like in other WoW expansions. Progress and Blizzard content plan permitting, officers will create plans to maximize possibility of clearing all content.
---
Classes: When it is clear that class choice or performance is becoming a liability, then that will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. I'm fine with sub-par classes players for easier raids. There will be opportunities to include those who aren't part of progress content.
---
Loot council: DKP systems are fair, but are easy to abuse without additional rules. A council system will generally give drops to characters that would benefit the long-term position of the guild in scheduled raids. A calibrated executive decision is a straightforward way to go.
---
Alts: Everyone will be encouraged (not mandatory) to work on an alt character. The personal benefits are farming, tradeskills, diversity, summoning, scouting, PvP etc. This character will enable alt raids and potential raid splits if MC/BWL are clearable early/easily.
---
PvP: 
---
Grouped PvP will be a part of the guild's experience, going on a regular basis on off-raid-nights.
---
Other Activities: 
---
Allows members to still have fun with the group but not be required to be online every night. Alt/farm raids if people want to shoot-off an MC clear on an off-tuesday night, this could very well be a reality. 20-mans on off-nights to have fun and to gear up new characters. Be social in the active discord w/ potential to play other games together, post media, chat on your phone at work, etc.
---
About the Guild Master: 
---
Veteran of Rank-1 NA guilds between WotLK and WoD, now mid-30's married professional. I want to enjoy WoW again and run a guild that others can enjoy and benefit in a way that others have given me. I have learned effective (and seen poor) leadership styles from elite raiding guilds and my career, and how to convert a vision into tangible plans.
---
Discord:
---
[https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ](https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ)
---
Find an online admin/officer/member and to start a conversation about your interest in the community. We are looking for various levels of involvement: officers, raiders, PvP-er's, and casual players.
---
GAMON
---
Mages also get the express lane though usually, except they have the benefit of being able to farm and solo super effectively in the open world.
---
I'll probably still play Priest though, and maybe with a spec more well rounded than my original Vanilla healing spec. I think we'll all be breezing through content this time compared to 2004 so min/max won't be as necessary.
---
I would stay up til like 4:30, then go lay in bed to "pretend" I was sleeping while my parents got ready for work, planning to hop back on when they left at 5:30
---
I ended up actually falling asleep woke up at like 2pm every time 
---
Turns out the human body needs sleep once in awhile
---
yeah, you only get a total of 3 character reservations across all realms
---
I see that box of tissues bud 😘
---
Some of the profession makes BiS.  
---
Others make useful stuff, like potions and bag.
---
Didn't they add that chaining feature during late vanilla? The flight cancel I know was added much later. I remember I used to just logout to flight cancel for the longest time until the cancel button got added.
---
I thought main cities like stormwind have all the trainers ..... do they not?
---
Everything ...
---
I was 19 and single at the time..... what can I say.
---
You say that now but apparently my memory was faulty I went to the wrong place twice trying to find out for samophlange quest in Barrens guess I was just farming exp from mobs.
---
Here is your rotation. Seal of command, judgement off cooldown, consecrate. Now if you want to actually be worth anything close to passable as a raid dps you will have to add every single melee and caster consumable in the game, and Oil of immolation and JuJu Flurry will be consumables that become part of your rotation.  There is another meta sprouting up involving using Manual Crowd Pummelers with lots of spellpower, combined with every consume in the game that could possibly push your dps higher than what is currently the ret meta. either way you are going to have to be the biggest tryhard in the guild and you wont get as much out of it dpswise as any other class would
---
Oh, yeah, we just get to keep our level 40s and steamroll ahead of literally everyone else...
---
No, of course not. It would be overpowered and stupid if we got to keep all of our characters with all of our gear, gold, materials, and levels.
---
 :/ same
---
Im gonna play like this then

The 6th proc of shadow weaving refreshes the timer of all stacks?  
---
or they have different timers?   
---
So reducing the cooldown of Mind Blast is important to increase dps AND to be able to use less Mind Flay, since Mind Flay does not trigger shadow weaving on all ticks?
---
I saw streamers complain Battle Shout doesn't really hold AOE agro.
---
Ok thanks for the clarification.
---
Keep in mind that if you level with a dagger in OH, you will be leveling both weapon skills and won't have to worry about leveling daggers from scratch if/when you decide to use them down the road.
---
It's a good idea and would fall in line with their other products such wc3 and starcraft.
---
I think people are a tad sensationalist when putting mistrust into Blizzard with the whole no changes thing. I think graphical enhancements plus game breaking bug fixes would be welcome, however I can understand that Blizzard may interpret that as fixing broken specs which would be bad in my eyes.
---
Rip .. no healers.
---
I think some of the new models made certain characters lose their charm somewhat (male undead comes to mind), but I don't get why people use "Disney model" as an insult, implying that WoW wasn't always a cartoonish-styled game?
---
Ayyy my man! I figured it came from PoE and I'm glad you gave it credit :D
---
That's much better.
---
The joke in retail for healers was you'd look up and notice there was rocks and fire.
---
Wait till you get your pet if you make a hunter so level 10 only place to get quest is dwarf area.
---
Modern games have a big emphasis on attention grabbing and fast-paced action to compete for attention amongst all the other flashy options out there. This on top of the microtransaction model and the gamble-ish nature of loot and progression leave a lack of substance and definable goals. I can't speak for GW2, but Destiny and modern WoW both have a big element of gambling when it comes to progression, where you bet your time to get opportunities (engrams/personal loot drops) to get gear that improves your current loadout and leads to progression. The variable nature of the gear (what level it drops at, the perks on it, etc.) means that for a veteran player who has progressed beyond the ramping exponential noobie progression will get real improvement only a small percentage of the time, and it makes it hard to feel accomplished by reaching a goal. In Classic WoW, the progression is long and slow, but it's relatively linear, meaning that your gains feel meaningful not only as a noob, but also as a veteran. You'll likely know the pieces of gear you're hoping for off a boss, they won't drop in multiple forms 90% of which are suboptimal for you, and getting that drop will feel meaningful. Basically, if you can stomach the lack of in-your-face advertising and smashmouth content and are willing to put in some work, you can expect a lengthy, fun, and psychologically-rewarding experience that is basically gone from the modern MMO market.
---
It’s more so just a tool to snap the initial threat on the pull. Given how the streamers I saw were rushing in, and that battle shouts threat is split on a per mob basis (e.g if you have 5 mobs and it’s applied to 5 group members at 50 threat each, it generates 50 threat per mob- not exact  values just used for illustrative purposes). I’m not surprised, in that circumstances it’s gunna suck at AoE threat. If you pulled each pack individually, and focus fired, you might have more luck with that.
---
People usually don't level as prot. If you look in their talent tree there are no OMG crazy tanking talents and most of the end game tanking comes from the gear.
---
I would strongly suggest leveling as fury or arms.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow#leveling-arms 
---
In the talent section of the guide you can see little toggle at the top left between fury and arms.
---
As long as you have the Str Stam gear and a shield with a FULLY LEVELED one hander (weapons have weapon skill, make sure urs is maxed for tanking or you will not hold any agro). Spec only comes in much later level 60+
---
Poetry
---
You're certainly not wrong about that
---
I only played for the last couple of months of vanilla, and rerolled a new toon in TBC. Most people I met while levelling were on their first characters, so I think that was commonplace!
---
Its just the asmonsluts voting in polls to prove how devout they are.
---
Just a bunch of NOTICE ME SENPAI kids who donate to streamers and stalk them ingame. The same people who type POGGERS in twitch chat are rolling warrior and they will quit once they stop watching asmongold.
---
No offense to the guy I enjoy his stuff but the following he has is basically an army and would jump off a bridge if he asked.
---
I don't know about warriors (thought crusader) but it is BiS with Lifesteal on Rets.
---
I honestly think Clap with demo and Sunder rotation should do the job in most cases.
---
No no, they just upscaled the textures on all 4 models. No changing of one into the other.
---
Mage, which surprised me. I play mostly Druid in modern. I mained a Rogue back in Vanilla, and find I don't really enjoy that class come Classic. Guess my play style has changed a bit in 15 years.
---
Look at dat fiiiiine ass crew
---
Wow had no idea that could turn yellow. Never saw it as anything but red.
---
**Tanks in good guilds are forced to go 31-Fury for most raid content. Fury = More DPS = More threat = more raid DPS.**
---
orc for meta shitter
---
tauren for superior taste
---
My old guild is reforming, but I’m cutting out with a friend of mine to play alliance instead of horde.  I’m still ambivalent about whether I like the decision and what to play, but I’m really excited.  Should be fun regardless.  I played on Nost and it was awesome.
---
Why? I’m just curious. I think if it defaulted to classic graphics it would be alright.
---
I wouldn't do it until level 58 for several reasons.
---
1. 58 to 60 is some of the worst questing efficiency, so you're not really missing out on much.
---
2. BRD has a lot of level requirements depending on what section you want to do. Emp runs are really brutal before ~59 because all the trash in his room is 58-60 and he's 59 too. At 56 you're going to get crushed so often and so hard, your under-geared healer just isn't going to be able to keep up. And if you wipe in Emp room, you might as well reset the instance for how long it will take you to get back.
---
3. You'll have the last ranks of Thunderclap and Sunder Armor, making things a bit easier. Your friends are also likely to get very important spells and abilities at 58 too, but their level won't matter nearly as much as yours does.
---
Ehhh, true but then you have to master the stance dance. Given this guy is just easing back into vanilla tanking I figured giving him a rotation that he could use while solely in defensive would be the way to go for the initial dungeons while he eases back into things. 
---
I agree on Clap definitely has its uses though, and is one hell of a way to mitigate some damage throughout early on.
---
Lol @ the idea of hard spec divisions in Classic.
---
Especially for moonfire
---
What server ?
---
19 million damage??
---
NOW FIX ROGUE STEALTH ANIMATIONS PLEASE
---
They would auto-attack in addition to growl.
---
you had the stress test not the beta
---
You level as ret till at least 40 when you have an option to go Prot and AOE grind mobs, or you can stick with Ret and keep going all the way to 60.
---
As some might have mentioned you white swing and hope for a proc, judege every cooldown and recast seal of command ...... that is pretty much it ..... mobs die slowly but you are in no danger EVER.
---
End came paladins do have some RNG shenanigans for once in a while ZOMG crit proc one shots. But most of the time you are either kited or will miss over and over and over. Plus you need INSANE gear to have fun in PVP.
---
Bottom line a holy paladin is a best healer in the game .... ret paladin is one of the worst DPS in the game. Vanilla raids should be easy so technically ret is OK but keep in mind ppl are carrying you.
---

6 Int + 3 Stamina.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4197/berylline-pads
---
10 Int + 5 Stamina + 6 Spirit.
---
4 more Int, 2 more Stamina, and 6 more spirit.  These two items are not even in the same league as each other.
---
So why could I create character on Classic Beta PVP realmlist? After servers were up, I could create character and play it.
---
This is really good info. Thanks man
---
happened to a lot of people, the stress test didn't cut off immediately, everyone that had it got booted. some people got to like level 5

Not sure if you're already doing something like this, but you can scan your drawings and turn them into png or svg really easily? You can even take a picture with your phone and use Adobe Capture app (free) and turn it into a svg/png.
---
Point being you can hand draw sketches like these and easily turn them into into something "digital" and high res. Kind of limited to sketches though. Doesn't apply to colored drawings as much..
---
I'm pretty sure you could trigger my flashbacks just by playing that sound.
---
The amount of times I woke to it in a mess, pulling my face up from the keyboard.
---
Fuuck, they gave me fake hope :c.
---
I did, now I'm waiting.
---
People will always be dicks.
---
That said, your actions have some consequences when you're trapped on a server with the same people. If you encounter dicks in your BGs, dungeons, etc, you'll probably end up muting them. 
---
General chat will still be full of garbage, and I remember BGs being kinda toxic. But when you're stuck with a group of people doing PvE content there's a lot less shit flinging than usual.
---
OP didn’t say that he wanted to go swords for their looks, he didn’t say he really really needs to go swords or rogue is ruined, these are assumptions.
---
If it is better to not go sword spec till 58, then let them notify OP so he can make the final decision, no need to go full brigade on someone just giving OP useful info.
---
Probably one of the most killed mons in wow.
---
I'm trying alliance to reduce burnout since I'm going horde in Classic.
---
I was extremely excited like that up until the beta. I listened to the vanilla soundtrack, I followed all the updates, and I went to this sub almost every day. Now I'm really toning my hype down and focusing on other things until August gets closer. At this point, I know that Blizzard has stayed true to their word and Classic will be everything we hoped for. I also don't want to burn myself out watching beta content. I'm saving all my hype for August.
---
There was some weird mod that let you modify the render 'window' of the game, so you could squash it up/down or left/right and generate additional space for bars/skills/other information.
---
Was pretty legit, could even make the game a ghetto Widescreen on your 4:3 monitor.
---
Make sure you do all your attuenments and pre raid bis quests first tgen theres nothing wrong with it
---
Yes and No. Keep in mind there were no server transfers or name changes, leveling and gearing a character took time so ppl actually had a reputation. If I recall correctly each server had a section on WOW forums so ppl actually would communicate through that. 
---
So there were dicks but after spending some time on the server you knew whom to avoid.
---
While I appreciate the work that went into those graphics, here is the thing:
---
**Good graphics don't make for a good game.**
---
With that being said: Provided the underlying game is Classic WoW, aka. a great game, good graphics would make it better :D
---
You're dead in the duration of BW and can't cast anything except PW:S, SW:P and Dispel, any casted spell is knocked back to hell. Have fun!
---
The argument isn't what type of music do you listen to on your road trip, it's do you set cruise control to 59 MPH on your road trip or 60 MPH on your road trip. There's just no argument for 59 MPH.
---
:):):):):)
---
For PVE, it probably doesn't matter at all.   The beneficial racials are so small as to be irrelevant.   For PVP, Orc wins by a mile.
---
Ret is a joke spec
---
Gonna get rolled either way is what I'm saying
---
Are you sure you need the HT macro to be cast sequence?  I’d also add a stealth macro that stealths if you’re not already.
---
I have plenty of other options available so the loss of r/c/b isn't significant. To be honest the majority of the time I just type /r anyways so it's kind of just habit now to have it if needed. Habit is what is preventing me from changing to a tenkeyless keyboard too... I use the thumb on my right hand to press the numpad enter key while still holding the mouse if I type something with just my left hand.
---
I needed the clock when camping rares, etc.
---
Why would anyone want to go sm ruin in raid though with already limited debuffs? DS ruin is the stronger raid build, right? 
---
Or are people just not wanting to respec due to sm ruin being such a great all rounder talent build for all content so that they can save money?
---
Obviously improved imp build for tanks isnt a factor in my above question.
---
Far from timeless, they were outdated 5+ years ago.
---
I’m not sure about alliance, but I know every Horde main city only has the classes trainers their represented race can use.
---
No he didn't lol. He would love for everyone to believe that, but he didn't.
---
Weapon dps is so important, so kinda like warrior your progression is limited by it. Later on you'll get the CC to deal with extra enemies, but for now gouge is your only option.
---
1-9 Rockbiter.    10-29 Flametongue.    30+ Windfury.
---
Have you rolled an ally toon before?
---
You are an idiot if you think posting a personally identifying picture to prove something to a stranger whose opinion matters less than bellybutton lint is going to happen. Think what you want, you're still an idiot at the end of the day. Im done with this conversation.
---
I guess you are right so maybe start with charge, demo, Defensive, sunder/revenge spam????  
---
to the OP - DO NOT USE heroic strike. Worst agro per rage generation ever unless you have a full bar and you are dumping rage.
---
Cannot quest in a raid.
---
&gt; I would be worried if I were classicdb
---
Why? They run no advertisements and have no community involvement. There's been no updates or maintenance, there's no API to support.
---
Whoever made it probably dumped the database on some shared shard they're already paying for, made sure the UI sort of worked, and then never once thought about it again.
---
All I've heard are rave reviews for the plaguelands.  It's all so bleak in my memory, which is strange because Duskwood is one of my top 3 zones.
---
Maybe just green &gt; brown.  In any event im really looking forward to approaching it positively this time around.
---
What do you like so much about it?
---
Then head across the street to the Rickety Stool Store
---
if my opinion doesn't matter at all u sure do reply a lot
---
last word
---
Here are some strong reasons why you should play a Warlock and not even consider the inferior classes:
---
1. Warlock has the highest number of abilities by a mile so it's one of the highest skill capped chars in pvp.
---
2. If you want faceroll godmode spec you can go SL if you want to melt people you can go Desrtro.
---
3. Their PvE specs are decent for PvP too so you won't have to worry a whole lot while out in the world during raid progression.
---
4. If the blizzard police won't go FUN DETECTED! FUN REMOVED! on the Infernal/Doomguard trolling you can terrorize low level zones with demons which is a lot of fun.
---
5. If you roll Alliance you won't have to compete for raid spots and it might even be possible to be the only lock in a raid early on so you get all the set pieces. 
---
6. Their tier sets look amazing.
---
7. Fast and easy leveling, strong against mobs and enemy players.
---
8. Free mount at 40 and the best mount in the game at 60.
---
9. Amazing class quests.  
---
There is one negative to consider: Soul Shards exist and they will take away anywhere between 16 to ALL of your bagspace at 60.
---
Literally no point. Spend your time instead talking about how the developers need to support unarmored mounts. Can’t let casual ideology ruin the game, focus your efforts.
---
Yeah I dont remember, I used to play paladin and both SW and IF had them since dwarf and human. So never really noticed.
---
Doesnt ds ruin with succ sacrifice output more damage on average?
---
Cool Jurassic park cup!
---
My dwarf male has the same exact running animation as a female pandaren.
---
It's so fucking bouncy it looks ridiculous.
---
Windfury ..... always .....
---
before windfury I used Flame for guaranteed damage
---
Yes my friends and I had an alliance alt server, but we didn’t get to 60.  So I’ve done a little bit of leveling but am overall much less familiar with it.
---
Brother, you are blatantly wrong. You’re confusing sharding and layering. A common mistake, so don’t feel too bad. But they serve completely different purposes.
---
The community is still amazing. Just don’t go to a server with the streamers and it’ll be fine
---
It's ok. I know I'm missing out on a lot of the action but in reality, I still have to work and everything will be reset anyways. The real fun starts on release day.
---
Those are rfk reward, not sfk. The sfk reward is https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3324/ghostly-mantle
---
I'm going to be playing a tank main.
---
I want to call him "Fury" from the movie "Fury", ya know, the one about the tank.
---
But people with think I'm called "fury" because of the talent tree... 
---
:(
---
Windfury is BiS when you get it. Frostbrand would be okay, but luckily you have Frost Shock to keep slows up...
---
"Guard Farm" Horde bias confirmed again
---
We will be fine. People will self adjust. Streamers will do their thing with ppl who want to participate. And folks who dont like streamers will do their thing on the streamer free servers.
---
Would the other 20 points typically go into protection or arms or is that dealers choice?
---
I was extremely toxic and well known on the arthas realm forums in vanilla and tbc.  No community is definitely worse than a toxic one, toxicity is great fun.  I crowd sourced 5k for my glad mount despite being "hated"
---
As said above, quests are non-completable while within a raid group. So best you can do is 5 total in a party. :P
---
Why is scare beast skipped at level 14 but not 30? Also, I think track beasts is totally overrated.
---
and you get like no experience from anything you can do on top of that.
---
I mean I wouldnt really care about not getting beta if blizzard themaelves went off of their own requirements, I specifically remember reading something about beta invites are based on being subbed and length of time subbed/played the game. I wouldnt be so upset if they just said "hey were inviting a lot of streamers for publicity." Instead of just blatantly lying. Litterally pokemane or whatever her stupid name is got invited and has never even touched the game before, doesnt help that I'm an old grump and just hate most streamers just because theyre annoying as all hell to me. Well now I'm getting to not being invited is a blessing in disguise.
---
Rant done.
---
im not crying, you're crying
---
Thank you for the link it looks incredibly helpful.
---
Avoid streamer servers and all is well.
---
Classic community is not well because people are social. People are always social, we are genetically programmed to be. However we are also genetically programmed to be dumb herd animals, and to follow the path of least resistence. Modern WoW offers multiple paths that do not involve socialisattion, all of which are easy, and streamer servers have herds.
---
I hybrid. I snap turn and other quick motions with the mouse but basically all constant movement is done with the keyboard.
---
Influencer beta
---
Wow I did too, I had no idea what was happening it turns out.
---
At the end they are very similar.  Typically i circle between RB FT and WF depending on what is the latest rank i have.  Recently between 44 and 56 i used rockbiter on a dagger. Top of my head it gave over 400 attack power - i was hitting with a dagger at 1.5 speed what i was doing with a 2h axe + Windfury at the same Level. 
---
Just gotta feel it out.  WF is unreliable and Will sometimes proc with a full hit when a mob has 1% HP. But sometimes you Will just take half the health on a first hit. 
---
I found RB being easily the best, SPECIALLY when at a recent rank up. Either with a dagger and shield or a 2h. You just hit so hard. 
---
&gt;But ill add - this is what made me realize how boring i find shaman besides getting WF procs.  I got tierd of starting each fight with atleast 2 globals to get totems out.  I realize its a small part of the gameplay and any shaman (like any hybrid) worth his salt Will heal at lvl 60. 
---
I just couldnt bare only enjoying one aspect based on a 20% chance. 
---
So i rolled paladin (old main). Which ofc is equally dumb when leveling but somehow i enjoy it more. Specially when i can aoe grind in sorrow hill.
---
You don't get the quest drop or credit for the quest kill while in a raid. I do believe you still get experience though but it is not worth it. Solo or duo is much more efficient.
---
The only thing I really like about having the clock stare me in the face is the alarm clock feature. Very handy.
---
Stormwind has a hunter trainer and a pet trainer in the dwarven district.
---
I think it's more just "undercity and mulgore don't have all the trainers because the designers don't think of them as main cities". I  think the designers thought of stormwind as the "capital" of the alliance, even though it might not have been in reality, so it has druid and hunter trainers.

The quest chain to obtain the [Scepter of the Shifting Sands](https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Scepter_of_the_Shifting_Sands_quest_chain) is long and requires a minimum of two trips into BWL (one to get Broodlord Lashlayer’s Head, another to complete a full run in under 5 hours), if you have all of the quest chains line up correctly. It also requires a lot of grinding, travel, and doing quests that require group of 3-5 and even raid groups up to 40 players.
---
I think this is because 15 years ago we didn't quite feel totally anonymous on the internet like so many do today (even though in reality the opposite is true).
---
Maybe it's because smartphones weren't a thing. We get bombarded by polarizing opinions on everything at every moment of every day now. It's difficult not to fall into the trap of acting like everyone else.
---
Or maybe it's because we didn't totally trust that in-game toxicity wouldn't actually get you banned and make you lose the game and all the progress you made. Now we know where the line is drawn in the sand and what Blizzard can't or won't do.
---
Or maybe it's just Reddit that's toxic and WoW Classic will be fine.
---
Horde.
---
I remember a Priest missed mind control during Razuvious fight and being hit for a similar numbers. Naxx was grueling.
---
[Thanks.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/210/119/9b3.png)
---
&gt; also I am aware many of you answer "The game is simply to imbalanced for 3v3 content and it wont be fun"
---
You might not complain about the imbalance, but a huge number of PvPers would try to 3v3, get wrecked by the most OP comp, and then complain about the imbalance.
---
Tons of people would be upset that their lvl 60 characters that took hundreds of hours to level and hundreds more to gear up are absolutely worthless in arena.
---
A million toxic egos would cry out for nerfs to the comps that are all but impossible to beat and there's a good chance that Bliz would listen.
---
And I think we all know how 'balance' changed Vanilla classes into BFA classes.

For some reason I forgot I got these from RFK.
---
This comment makes me feel allot better Abbott my situation. Thanks for that.
---
I cant believe blizzard is doing updated graphics and character models.... Thanks for the screenshot of it op
---
I feel kind of odd being in the boat where the only games that excite me are OSRS and now Classic WoW. Get to use whatever keybindings I want with impunity.
---
Unfortunately not but i do get to play with my SO and a buddy of mine who actually played back in the day. No more solo WoW for me
---
Naw I haven't gotten my letter yet
---
They have made similar mistakes many times in the past 3 weeks. It sucks
---
Request invite was really handy but it didn’t feel vanilla like so I guess I’m glad it’s gone. I’ll probably get heat for saying this , but I’m really glad to see the retail raid frames. They’re just so much better in that state.
---
Yup, this never really changes and depends on the mage messing up
---
Or charge

Or backwards for hunter disengage.

Must. Not. Make. Backstab. Joke....
---
Even with the new league being hype as hell, I 100% know I'll be done with it in 1 month max (usually takes 2-3 weeks). Luckily there is shadowbringers less than a month away aswell which I'll likely end up playing intensively until classic and then put it on side atleast first couple months of classic.
---
12 button mouses ftw.
---
!remindme 85 days
---
Left side! Even side! Many Whelps! HANDLE IT!
---
Most of them are dead now unfortunately.
---
To add to that, avoid servers with lots of Pserver folks. Taking the moderation off those worlds turned them into toxic waste dumps. There is no comparison between a Pserver community and a Retail community, Pservers are far worse.
---
Basically, just avoid everyone that's ever played WoW before and you'll be fine. Find the newbies.
---
Lmao problem I had with hot pockets is I always was a fat ass and wanted 2, but if you cook 2 for 4 min it was way too hot, 3 min too cold, never bothered to find the right temp, closest I got was 3:38.
---
It's not the community needs to be in game for our brains to fuinction correctly lol
---
You’re correct. Can’t have horde and alliance toons on the same server.
---
I mean... it's just kind of over kill, don't you think? I'm laughing that Blizzard even has a calculation to have a boss deal out that much damage. Like , why? It's not like there's a tank out there with 18 million health.
---
Yeah and some of the old gang is going to play again
---
Level smithing, farm up, buy the first Lionheart Helm pattern. Charge silly amounts to craft. Use this money to get a lock on all future patterns that hit the AH. Have a monopoly on the pattern, and charge absolutely insane prices. Watch as people scrounge to donate for him to get it crafted.
---
Takes some dedication, but the payoff would be delicious.
---
Kick harry in his hairy jewels until he rolls healer and yall are set.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
I already got to clear MC and onyxia over a decade ago, why do I give a shit if someone does it 14 years later? Of all the stuff to be jipped about.
---
Lol hilarious! Level 26/27 was always the level I questioned myself whether or not I could be bothered continuing playing a character.
---
I've got at least 3 alts who made it that far before stopping
---
It was turn in some rare crafting mats, or it was free if you were exalted with AD already.

I've only ever played Alliance. So this opportunity to finally roll Horde is sooo damn tempting. But I'm just not sure I can do it. I'm roughly familiar with the leveling path for the alliance races but know none of it for Horde. Such a debacle. And after that I have to figure what race and class my first toon is going to be?? Ugh. Too hard. Too long to think about it between now and August 27th.
---
Take my upvote.
---
But why tho? You can log onto retail and do pet battles all you want. You're talking about implementing a whole new system into the game that very few people want. For what reason? The problem most of us have with this type of thing is what is too much? What about barber shop, what about this and that.
---
They didn't have the original client, but they still had the animations from vanilla. There are tons of moves that just aren't there anymore. If they use new models, they have to make new animations which require more time. It's not as simple as just putting in the new models, they already said that in a blue post somewhere.
---
I was talking about character model and weapon physics, not grass physics. A lot of the models have cool effects, some of the fat human race have some meme-y fish weapons and they jiggle around instead of just stick straight out like some of the creature weapons in classic. Also boobs.
---
I agree, this NoChanges meme bullshit is causing Blizzard to not change anything they can avoid out of fear of legitimately upsetting people. Most people don't care about aesthetic changes and small UI changes like friends list and frames etc. and the few that do would still play classic regardless.
---
Varying amounts of certain items plus gold, depending on your rep with Argent Dawn. If you got the exalted with them, that could deserve an achievement. But we’ll have months to get our rep up (or collect the mats/gold) before Naxx drops. Attunement will be easy. It’s getting a guild with 40 non-Neanderthals that’s difficult.
---
They ruined my old human soldier and my black human.
---
Oh that is a nice shoulder for the level. I don't know if I just forgot about it or if I just had terrible luck and never had it drop.

The is most definitely Guzu's room. last week he have a "room tour" and moved the camera around for us to see his setup.
---
the community is pretty much the same, pserver communities are super chill
---
I thought the request invite would he a good addition but what are the downsides of having that? Is it out of the person's control who's being invited?
---
Thanks, I still have it but it is extremely faded.
---
It would be interesting but also microscopically point out horrible class imbalance far more than what's currently in game.
---
I can understand that, I personally liked the updated UD models though. Especially the one with the Iron Jaw replacement, I thought that was dope as shit. Not to mention the barber shop and new hair models are great too.
---
And some games have a terrible interface which won't properly let you reset bindings
---
Yes this, but also he said it has some problems due to this guide being from tbc and have some small discrepancies in quests that may not exist
---
My issue is new models means new animations which means no old models or animations just like how they took away our option to use old models in live. 
---
For now can we not just keep the old models then a few years down the line work on the new ones for the people desprate to live in a cartoon disney world?
---
Are you introducing your SO to it for the first time?
---
I'm just imagining how scary those worgen in duskwood look when mobbing you.
---
No wonder everyone thought Vanilla was challenging - No one could see what they were doing!
---
At higher levels of gear, SM/Ruin is the highest damage PVE spec. Assuming that you're part of a raid that micromanages debuff slots. (Most raids won't.) The difference isn't big though.
---
C'thun laser was the same way, they just made the damage multiply each time it jumped to keep it simple I guess. Big numbers but simple code.

My computer started sweating when I played this video

NA/pvp server looking for a guild.  I'm looking for a guild to hang out with until classic release and then progress through leveling and raids asap.    
---
I have experience since wotlk release as all classes. Quit retail at end of legion and have loved raiding every expansion.  Willing Togo horde or alliance, just looking for a solid guild who wants to have fun progressing.
---
Ya the consensus on pvp play is orc all the way and I totally get why. Just fighting my inner desire to not be part of the pack (even though with only 3 options there isn't really a road less traveled race).
---
the stress test ended 6 days ago, seems unlikely he would have had access to the beta for nearly a week by accident
---
Fucking Dave, you know he was the trouble maker of the group.
---
This was the BEST
---
I understood that reference.
---
Whatever ability is newest. They're designed to do the same damage, they just do it in different forms. Then at 60, you can swap over to windfury and forget about the others.
---
I think most people are just frustrated waiting and only thing to do is bitch at each other. It'll clear up considerably when we're back in game and people arent using multiple Reddit accounts to troll. I've been a prick lately too but I know for me personally I feel stressed and anxious for launch. My normal hobbies are feeling less satisfying and so they arent letting me decompress enough. I see many posts with similar feelings, so I really do think that it will be better.
---
Even as somebody who has predominantly played Alliance since Vanilla, I must say that Mulgore is the most beautiful and best starting zone.
---
Yes. I had a lot of fun with double maces in pvp as well.
---
Hey man I clipped these, I didn't "cherry pick" these or anything, I watched like 6 minutes of an old video that I made because I still have the uncompressed file. I could find similar examples of this many times over. The issue you're complaining about in this post has always been a feature in WoW, it's just more apparent now because servers, player hardware, and connections on both sides of those are greatly improved since vanilla/tbc. 
---
My videos were very popular in 2008~ because people would say "how is your game so smooth" - they were 60FPS. Most players couldn't even run the game at a respectable frame rate, and had much worse internet on average compared to today. The only reason it's SO obvious and exploitable now is because we're not playing with a majority of players that have 90-120 ping with 45 fps in WoW. 
---
It's always been a feature.
---
Aw yeah! I'm so happy they fixed this.
---
Just grabbing first rank to have it. Track beast is nice for finding named mobs and specific beasts to tame for higher ranks. Only 10 copper, might as well.
---
Can you prove you were a high rated player? Noobie.
---
Watch Esfand on Twitch. His main is a Ret Pally. Good dude to watch also. Number one ret pally
---
Tedrasil = Alabama?
---
Really nice picture. Thats me :)
---
Rockbiter is flat damage increase, it's best on fast(1H) weapons.
---
Flametongue damage is normalized per minute, which means that if you go 2H it will most likely be better than Rockbiter.
---
Frostbrand is flat damage increase but the proc is normalized per minute. The proc itself is only really useful in PvP though since it just affects movement speed.
---
Of note is that, since both Flametongue and Frostbrand do elemental damage, they can be Resisted by enemies. Though of course, they also ignore armor.
---
Windfury proc rate is normalized per minute, but the damage is flat increase, so it works for both 1H and 2H weapons. It should be overall best DPS too.
---
you remember that travelling to other continent is long process back then
---
You tanking? Rock biter
---
You doing damage? Wind fury
---
You meme up? Frost brand
---
agreed , but when you play in westfall you always got someone asking for Deadmines group , so it is worth it
---
Dunno just saw people posting similar earlier

Coastal menace is not bad , it is the murlocks around that guy that will destroy you by swarming

---
You need 5/5 Shield Specialization—mostly because it allows you to add 1 point to Improved Shield Block.
---
This is imperative. You block two attacks instead of one and given the attack speed of most heavy hitters, this means you're *always blocking* and pretty much never taking full damage (including crushing blows from level 62+ elites.)
---
Pre-Tier 2, invest in Anticipation to help you read 440 defense. Post-Tier 2, switch to Toughness because the percentage-based armor increase will outperform the former.
---
5/5 Defiance is a must-have since it makes Sunder Armor produce even more threat. Finally, get Last Stand.

Takes far longer to get anywhere in classic, As as casual if I end up playing it will take me months just to max then a few more months farming gear to use that gear to farm gold to level proffesions to spend a few more months using them to get more gold and craft better gear to then raid and with a casual guild that will take a few more months and we wont clear naxx im sure and after all that I can do it again with a character that feels entirely seprate and different from my first. 
---
I think I had my whole character roster (one of every class) maxed and geared with pre raid BIS by the end of 3 weeks into BFA at which point it was log in every 6 hours to do some shitty event things.
---
It is extremely common in any type of gaming "forum" for people to be calling other people toxic. Doesn't really matter if its Reddit, twitter, Facebook, actual forums, YouTube, Twitch. It's just gaming in 2019, everything is considered toxic now.

Not only it's possible, so many people do it it's annoying.

GOLDSHIRE BELONGS TO THE HUMANS

Would be difficult since they’d have a 10 hour window, and unless they were crashing from an obscenely long stream, they wouldn’t sleep through that timeframe.
---
Plus, if they were intelligent, they’d park their main by the gong in case of emergency each time they got off.
---
did they fix the character strafing animations too?
---
Getting these two errors:  [https://pastebin.com/C5F4PjBD](https://pastebin.com/C5F4PjBD)

With the second one, the count keeps climbing and then crashes the game eventually:
---
I was invited to both stress tests but no to beta. My error code:
---
"No realms currently available (WOW51900309)"
---
Thank you for your insight. I'm sure this will be super helpful.
---
Good luck brave Warrior.
---
I’m going to be killing this guy a lot, nothing personal though.
---
That's a real life saver
---
Data storage conversion probably as they upgrade the software over the years. A friend of mine had pics that kept getting shrunk. Basically lost them because they were like preview size now. Forget what online photo storage he said he was using.
---
Gonna be funny when they keep their servers a secret until launch. Your guild decides on a server 2 weeks prior and begin leveling there, then BAM. You find out you’re on a streamer server.
---
When my team was too incompetent to win WSG, I would use what I called the "flush the shitters" strategy.   
---
Basically, hide with the flag. Drag on the game as long as possible. Sooner or later, the baddies in your game will leave, and hopefully the people who replace them are better.   
---
Sadly a lot of the time, the people who joined are no better than the people who left. They promptly run into the center of the battleground and pointlessly hitting other players. Then they too, get bored, and leave.   
---
It could easily take 90 minutes or 2-hours to complete a game this way. But sooner or later, competent players would join my side, or the enemy team would get frustrated and quit. Won a ton of games this way.
---
It depends on a lot of factors. Like how you make your gold for raid nights. Some can make it on the AH with far less time invested. Some grind it out slowly and steadily. Another factor is how fast you level, how well your guild progresses through raids, etc. I would say it is probably 1,000 hours or more, easily, for most people
---
It will not be available till several month from now so yeah. Otherwise with the current level of available knowledge and people actually knowing what an MMO is all of the end game raid content will be much much easier than 15 years ago when a DPS rotation was past from one person to another via guild forums and in-game messages.
---
Rockbiter  is also used for tanking dungeons while leveling.
---
If you can raid 3 nights a week you'll have no problem getting T3 eventually.
---
You have to factor in a lot of stuff. First, each set piece drops from one or two bosses tops. Second, each piece is class specific and it's possible for shammy gear to drop for allies and vice versa. Finally, even if the piece you need does drop, you're in a raid with 39 other people and will have to roll against every other person playing the same class. Expect to be doing lots of raiding to get a full set.

I would run BRD for hand of justice. Ironfoe is something you may burn yourself out on.
---
If it's the same as pservers the formula actually changes between Yellow and Orange mobs
---
Now this is interesting, if you are actually a retail guy, who is trashing pserver community, now tell me who is the worse. You wont find friendlier game community that vanilla pservers, honestly. I wonder what makes you think opposite.
---
It reduces social interaction for one thing, and is far worse as spam since it actually takes up UI space. Imagine the following scenario: you're leading a raid and are trying to fill out your last 5-10 spots lt so. What would you prefer: a lot of whispers telling your their gear/class/spec, down in your chat log, or getting spammed with UI pop-up prompts all the time?
---
Honestly, I'm in favour of removing it just because it gets people to talk more, instead of using sociallu sterile UI elements.
---
So good. I forgot about this one.
---
They did 2 stress tests 1 week apart so they let you have the client for the duration.
---
They can and do.   
---
Hybrids are incredibly good at running flags in vanilla. Take a look at Warsong. On both teams, 5-7 people tend to be doing nothing, drooling in the middle of the map. In those conditions, one competent druid, shaman, or mage can **easily** drag on a game for a basically unlimited period of time.
---
That's great. I have my best buddy who is going to play with me and a few new people we've met in other games since so I am in a similar situation.
---
Windfury with a 2 hander or slow 1 hander. Flametongue with a really fast one hander.
---
Duo is better than solo, so easy to get into a situation where you have to retreat because you agroed 1 extra mob! Also downtime is reduced in duos
---
*until Legion* it was. It was Legion that forced the new animations on older models. [Here's a random duel from WoD where you can see the regular non-bouncy human animations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV5ovs7hbbU] I played with old models through all of WoD and it was great.
---
Dude be weird! Just don't send a dick pic or anything until at least the third email.

I plan on healing dungeons for a big portion of my leveling, but especially in the 50s.  There are some pre-raid BiS items that drop off of lower level bosses in BRD ([Lord Roccor](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=9025) and [Golem Lord Argelmach](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=8983)) so I'll gladly run it over and over, trying to get further each time.
---
Hi, /u/Davedication
---
I’ve sunk so much money into that game. With classic coming soon it just feels so stale.  Not to mention I haven’t bought the last two expansions so I’m way behind anyway.
---
First off, I'm sorry to hear that you are 30 and in a place where you have the time to go for r14 😂
---
Second, yes, found some via the vanilla friend finder site.
---
They disabled it in modern WoW altogether? I thought this was just a Classic bug.
---
It's comes down to how much you know about your class.. It'll go alot faster if you research your classes's pre-raid BiS gear so you you have the best gear ASAP for raiding.. Understand what specs you should rolling, for raiding...
---
This way you're not just wondering around and learning as you go, and instead have clear objectives of what you need to do.. There's a ton of info avaliable out there for Classic, that didnt used to be avaliable.. Use it to your advantage. 
---
P.S. I think Hunters has the coolest looking T3 gear, and Hunters are also the fastest levelers. And if you're a Night Elf you can use invisibility to avoid being ganked.
---
Wellat 15 hours a week max it should take you around 8-9 weeks roughly to get 60.
---
It makes me angry when I log in and see what they did to my characters.
---
No worries, progress doesn't carry over anyway.

Itemization for swords is better while leveling.

**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

Go with sword in mh and dagget in off. Level as combat rogue.
---
Why not an option to have server time show real time instead?
---
Troll master race
---
Needs more dakka.
---
That's good info, also combat is good for levelling because backstabbing with agro doesn't work
---
That's the meta...
---
While 1 hour per level is rough, 180 hours or 7.5 days /played to 60 is not unrealistic if you know what you're doing and you play a spec that's decent at leveling. Most people will probably be somwhere around 10-20 days though, because they take their time.
---
Historically solo levelers were faster. I agree duo is much more fun and more flexible but a solo mage AOE grind or a hunter chain pulling mobs is more efficient.
---
Depending on the server the arcane crystals were the hardest to acquire without paying insane prices from AH. 
---
I chose to take the exalted with Argent dawn route. Which I most likely won’t do with Classic as that’s a mind numbing grind.
---
I am so sick of playing on Siberian private servers its 150ms ping and obscure time throughout the day.
---
A local server will be a nice change of pace.

---
Where’s your poop bucket? You seem to have everything right minus that. Luckily you have time to perfect this on 8/27!
---
It really depends on weapon speed, slow weap rock biter fast one flame tongue, windfury is great in PvP but after doing min max research for pve 2h rockbiter is more consistant than 2h windfury, sometimes you'll get the proc and kill something instantly, really depends.
---
You simply cannot effectively SOLO level as a dagger speck since your main ability backstab can only be used from the back of the mob.... 
---
Sword spec is very similar to warrior. I suggest always fighting a mob couple of levels below you. Sinister strike spam with some riposts ..... GG.
---
As a Software developer, I can confirm that you sometimes get logs that go on for 6 hours with a vague describtion what happened, and then you have to search for hints of it happening.
---
Can totally imagining players (that aren´t paid to report) to be even less precise with the surrounding facts.
---
According to Wowhead Classic there isn't a single Shaman trainer in the entire Tirisfal Glades. It doesn't seem correct to me but watch out.
---
BC Timewalking I believe
---
Well, let's see if I can get an estimate.
---
First is the leveling. Assuming you're not a maximally efficient player who can also get ahead of the curve (which you aren't if you're only playing 15 hours a week), then you're going to likely need about 10 to 13 full days of in-game time to get to 60. So we'll be charitable and say it's 10, which gives us an initial 240 hours.
---
After that comes the raiding itself. You'll want to get into a guild that will actually be able to reach Naxx. It's going to be difficult in your state since you'll be left behind with the initial recruitment waves of fresh 60s who raced there, but it can be done, mostly by showing commitment and efficiency. That's going to require you to farm a pre-raid BiS. At this point we're probably in Phase 2 (Naxx doesn't release until Phase 6, mind you, which is probably about two years away). You're going to need, and this is a rough estimate, about 30-50 minutes per dungeon run, with each drop averaging around a 20-30% chance, and around 16-18 pieces of gear. Let's average it at 17 and 40 minutes per with a 25% chance. That means for each piece of gear, you'll need about 160 minutes, or just shy of 3 hours, in any actual dungeon itself, plus transit time and group searching time that will likely add an hour. Again for charity's sake, we'll pretend that a group will keep running that dungeon until you get the item. So let's say 4 hours per piece of gear (and again, this is very charitable). We can also assume that some gear pieces are coming from quests, so we'll say 56 hours to get pre-BiS.
---
Now you're in a guild that recruited you because you showed commitment to farm the best gear possible before getting raid epics. This is the sort of guild you'll need if you ever want to reach Naxx, let alone clear it. From here on out you'll want to demonstrate that you're a core raider, which means showing up to a minimum of 80% of raids with full farmed consumables at the ready. You're going to want a minimum of 3 hours of farming time for each raid week (probably more depending on spec). After your guild starts using flasks, that'll jump to 6 hours a week. On top of that, you'll have the raids themselves. Here you are lucky; because people already know the content, most guilds will likely be running two raid nights of between 3 and 4 hours each. We'll be uncharitable now and assume it's 4. So each week you'll be dedicating 11 of your 15 hours to farming and raiding, and you'll do that every single week for 2 years, and then at some point you'll be farming even more, which kicks it up to 14 of your 15 hours.
---
So, if you got to level 60 in the 16th week after release, that leaves you with 36 weeks left in the year. We'll make it simple and assume your farming duties will increase in the new year. That's 11x36, and then 14x52. Now, I'd take off 20% of that, but we'll add in human error here and assume that sometimes raids will go longer than intended, and sometimes you'll be doing off-night raids like ZG. That's 396 hours + 728 hours before you set foot in Naxx. And this is assuming a guild that actually doesn't get caught up in AQ40. Despite what some people may claim about Vanilla being easy, a lot of guilds are going to break apart at Vael simply because they were letting too many bad players or players with bad specs into the raids, and they can't square the circle of raid efficiency+friendships.
---
Now you're in Naxx. Your raid is pushing its limits. You've had to abandon notions of only 15 hours per week; assume now that you're going to be farming for 9 hours just to compensate for wipes, and you'll also be dealing with transit times and world buffs. Now, we presume you're not in the best guild ever, but it's a guild that still, with patience, manages to beat KT a few months in. So for three months you'll be spending 17 hours a week minimum, or 204 hours.
---
Now you want 8/8. So does everybody else. We'll assume you're rolling a class that has 6 core members in it, and let's say there are 8 others in your tier token group. So you need to compete against 13 other people. So let's say when a token drops, you get it 1 out of every 14 times. This number will decrease as more people fill out specific slots, but it's a good average. Also there's a ring in the T3 set, but I assume you want armor specifically.
---
Some of this gear you will have already gotten while trying to clear. We'll say you got 3/8 before you cleared KT, and at this point I'm being *very* generous. That means that you'll probably farm for another 4 months before you get a full set, unless you were one of the most indispensable members of a slightly preferential Loot Council guild that rewards you with gear tokens preferentially because you were just that good. So we'll say that after 7 months in Naxx, you'll get your 8/8 (something *very* few people had back in the day, since TBC released before most guilds could ever get Naxx on farm). So at 17x28, that's 476.
---
So you've got 240+56+396+728+476=1896 hours as a ballpark estimate, and I'd wager it would actually be over 2000 by the end of things. That's approximately 83 days of in-game time.
---
If you think you can handle dedicating 83 days of time doing literally nothing in-game for two years other than farming and raiding, or else adjusting the time you spend to account for free time as well, then reassess your goals now.
---

---
I watched this whole thing like I'm not gunna be seeing it 100x come August.
---
Heaven on earth
---
I was able to get an undead priest up to 10 with farming mats and crafting a wand in about 3 hours. I'm no speed leveler, but it felt like a normal speed.
---
if you find 8-10 is slow prepare for much worse ..... up to level 20 is  very fast .... the real grind begins after 20.
---
First 10 levels of rogue are probably the worst of any class. My only advice is to tough it out. Once you get dual wield at 10 it's like playing a whole other class. Then laugh at warriors for taking the worst place for the remaining 50 levels.
---
Thank you Blizzard!!
---
Gotta raid MC with poly bound to 1 because pvp is life. Well done sir
---
I’d estimate to say an average person can get 60 in around 8-9 days, so around 200 hours just for max level. Now it’ll be a lot more if you choose to slow down and pvp, is focus on professions. At 60, you spend countless hours grinding pre-raid gear, gold, and raid consumes. 
---
Then you’ll have to start raiding, it’ll take many weeks for your entire guild to get what they need from each raid, before you can advance to the next raid(all the while every week you need to be grinding gold and consumes). Now, Naxx being the hardest raid for a guild to clear, you’ll have to put in more time than the average person. I do not think 15 hours a week will get you there, but who knows..
---
I’d say over all you’re looking anywhere from 1500-2000 hours played to a full T3 set
---
Yeah, that and the classes have changed a lot as well. I don’t know if I should pick priest, warlock or Druid. :)
---
Played Shaman in Vanilla, which changed with TBC pre-patch to Warlock :)
---
Honest question- why do you love seeing streamers bypass other people's hours of honest hard work by getting free handouts?
---
Well doubling in price in 2 weeks is highly unlikely, but what if you could get that 70 g and get your mount earlier and be able to farm up more than an extra 70g in the same time.
---
Long story short, a long time mainly due to leveling with only 15 hours a week will take you longer than others. So many variables it will most likely take 6+ months unless you're a main tank or top healer, you also have to hear 39 other raiders to even said naxx due to the healing and gear checks that place has.
---
But 15 hours a week at level 60 is a good amount if you're efficient since 6-9 Of those are actual raiding on average.
---
Enjoy the journey though is my advice! I ain't 13+ anymore so my time is limited like yours if I pick up classic again.
---
Obviously the writer here is speaking GENERALLY. Of course there are exceptions...but thats not interesting here.
---
Generally, Locks beat mages, and other classes pretty hard 1v1 due to fear spam.
---
my transmog is honestly just so insanely good, and i love my character and blizz's teams that make such dank frames, models, animations, textures... and seeing my dude inhabit this vast world with different atmospheres, and then like picking some flowers or fishing some stuff. then ambushing someone trying to kill a rare mob, and then cannibalizing his corpse. LOL. i didnt have too much headcanon for my character when i made him but now it feels like he has been on so many adventures.
---
as most of you probably dont know, star wars the old republic drops a new xpac almost that exact same time. wonder if its a coincidence
---
If leveling on classic release after doing this doesn't kill your desire to play then you're definitely blizzard's target audience.
---
&gt; That's annoying, because otherwise you have to remember to go check another clock elsewhere, or your phone.
---
Does that even count as first world problem or are we on zero world problems now
---
I would not mind this.
---
For me, the best thing about classic is the return to communities and social interaction between players. The journey being better than the destination. The dangerous feel of the world and overall difficulty. The absence of the go go go mentality in dungeons and going back to cornerpulling, cc and careful planning.
---
I will definitely enjoy playing the game with the old graphics. But all my reasons to love classic are rooted in gameplay, not esthetics, so sure, bring it on.
---
Sorry, no change club members, I'm only a part time member ;)
---
I'm making a goal to do every Quest. All the little ones, the ones tucked away from Hermits on top of mountains, and things like that.
---
 Also I think I'm going to change my main class. I spent most of my hardcore raiding days as a holy priest. This limits me because I would like to stay as a raiding healer. I don't like the Paladin class, unfortunately, and I can't stand Druid healing. So that kind of leaves me with the Shaman class, which pretty much means I have to play Horde. But since I'll be on a PvE server, I think I'm actually going to split my time between both Horde and Alliance this time. I'll do my raiding on the Horde side and screw around the Alliance side for fun and PvP. Since I very much feel this is my "last hurrah" with wow, so to speak, playing both sides will let me experience the entire game.
---
Sure, just make a female one.
---
Now the real game begins.
---
Some guides aren’t optimal, personally I prefer to finish a zone then move to the next. But this also feels slow, but I get more of the story in the end. 
---
There are Addons that try to streamline the leveling experience by using a set routing pattern to acquire the most experience in the shortest amount of time. May give one of those a shot.
---
imho, stuff that will most likely be done by addons anyway, should be left in the game with an option to toggle it.
---
Maybe leave it off by default though.
---
It is, some of the guys been playing with me through my marriage proposal, birth of my kids, the only reason I'm hyped about the game is the people
---
I want a shared world. The differences between the models/animations are too great for that.
---
That’s a beautiful story, thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; I've read that Blizz figures 1-3 hours per level to get from Lvl 1-60.
---
The world record speed was 4.3 hours "per level". Plan on closer to 6 to 8 hours per level if this is your first time playing.
---
Naxx launched 574 days (~19 months) after the initial US release of Vanilla. To reach one year /played in that time, you would have had to play over 15 hours a day, every day.
---
You don't need to do this to get T3.
---
1. Reach level 60 some time before or after Naxx releases. This is maybe 10 days /played for someone not speedrunning.
---
2. Find a guild that likes you, thinks you're skilled, is ready to raid Naxx or has been raiding Naxx, and has a need for your class and spec. This can't be measured.
---
3. Get attuned for Naxx. It's a rep grind, doesn't take more than 1 day /played for sure.
---
3. Have that guild carry you through the previous raids for as long as it takes you to get enough gear for Naxx. These raids will take 3-4 hours a week, it will take several weeks probably, so let's call this 20 hours /played. But even this step is optional, the guild could just carry you through Naxx.
---
4. Clear Naxx until all your T3 drops at least once. This can't really be measured. It could be one run, it could be infinite runs. If Naxx takes you 3 hours to clear and you have to clear it 20 times to get your T3, this is 60 hours /played.
---
So a player could get a full set of T3 in as little as one week /played. This is pretty unrealistic, but so is trying to measure getting a set of armor in /played in any case.
---
What's the duration on that? With pets at 42 it'll be insane. Mages might be able to wait it out in iceblock tho.
---
Had access to parent ensuite that was very close nearby.
---
But I'll try my best to fix my mistakes on the re-release.
---
I haven't played WoW for a long time, is this not how it is in live game? What is different here?
---
You must have destroyed your back/wrists?   
---
I see you didn't forget the napkins though 😏
---
What do you expect? People are not the same as they were 14+ years ago. Many who will play Classic have played it when it was new. the awe and wonder of a new game is long gone. Most know how the old game plays and will be no better than the retail version crop of players.
---
Horde has the pvp lads, Allie get baked ne nail box dancers. I can accept this
---
Where does he recommend to go instead? I’m not up to date on Joanna.
---
I was like this when I came in early a few days and worked 10 hours instead of 8. 
---
At like 5:30 I thought “hey I’m halfway through my shift just about wow!” Even though on a normal day I would come in at 3 not 1....
---
Now days I wouldn't last 5 minutes like that, the power of youth.
---
Yes napkins...... for when I spilled the Mountain dew.
---
This is so true, I just can't login anymore on any pserver, I don't even wish for a beta access, I just want the game to be released.
---
In the meantime, netflix is my friend!
---
I am so desperate, lately I started login to my office machine with remote desktop connection at nights, work is an acceptable replacement drug wheb I can't have my Classic fix!!
---
The entire idea of Layering/sharding is to reduce congestion, what is so hard for you to understand about that?
---
Also depends on guild. Some get to 60 quicker, get the UBRS key and start rend runs and alike - fill in with &lt;60 lvl players. Or people starting BRD Arena farm where high level isn't also that much needed on everyone. Some items may come from elite quests too, which may not need 60.
---
Just the fact that to have SL your corruption is back at 2s cast makes it questionable statement.
---
Why?
---
What?
---
170-250 hours to 60
---
3 weeks at 60 at 20 hours a week to prebis.
---
Another 20 hours of grinding for your epic mount.
---
2 years of daily play averaging 4 hours a day. 
---
Probably in excess of 150 days /played at a minimum. Likely 200+ for most people, as if you are going to put in the time to get t3, our probably like the game, so you’ll play as often as you can.
---
Man it was crazy! So many memories!
---
I remember my first time in naxx was this fight and being 1 Of 2 tanks brought into this figjt by a top raiding guild on the server who were progressing on this fight and it just blew my kid brain at the time!
---
I was expecting this song https://youtu.be/87nkJquHnAU
---
The orc male dance even resembles the default Fortnite dance a little. Vanilla was clearly ahead of its time.
---
I've played both pretty extensively. Due to the prevalence of world chat on pservers and the lack of moderation, it definitely has the opportunity to be more toxic on a regular basis.
---
&gt; some of the best games in history (SC, D2, WC3, Vanilla WoW)
---
Your definition of "some" must have like, a hundred places
---
If only they would add slight alterations to flying high and low and changing the course a little. For example that you would fly over hogger if you are lucky.
---
Try leveling a hunter, no pet till 10 and only one melee ability similar to a heroic strike empowering next melee swing on a 6 sec CD. Don't forget range weapons don't work up close. There is literally a level 5 quest mobs that rejuves I could not kill a single one and had to run away. Impossible to solo.
---
And being alive and not dying in a fire
---
I wuz ere 2k19
---
For the Alliance.
---
Yes, main tanks always will get funneled gear because if that guild doesn't the next guild they go to certainly will
---
I’ve always wanted to try to get into an Aussie guild so I could raid before work (second shift loser here)
---
Synthesis was unfortunately a pretty shit league. Hopefully Legion will be better.
---
You’re leaving out seal dancing.
---
I appreciate how much they are using input from the community to help make the experience as close to vanilla. I lvled in BC and remember haw hard and fun it was then. I remember going to make hot pockets or Tyson’s chicken patties while in a flight path. I liked the old grind. It endeared you to the game more.
---
In regards to cat videos I feel like I relate to this one more 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=VqmPo7oNrg8
---
You did not have beta access. It was a glitch that occurred during Tuesday maintenance. They also did some updates to the authentication servers today. 
---
Everyone who saw in the launcher that they had beta access but then didn't a bit later.....you don't have access. It was a short glitch after authentication maintenance. Nothing more.
---
What relevancy does any of that have to do with getting Ironfoe?
---
Yeah, especially if the guy reports bug with a vague local time and you have to do the maths to transate it into server time to get relevant logs!
---
yes lol. everyone was a dick, but it was a different world. for instance, i drove a ferrari thru the barrens to pick up your mom.
---
SHANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANAA KNEES KNEES KNEES
---
There is no way to get that "first time feeling" again. Nothing you do will be able to recreate it. Face it, we are all trying to capture something that will never be again.
---
Someday there will be a world of warcraft museum showing classical art. I think your art will get there.
---
I thought Cd counters like omni CC were integrated into the beta
---
Can u summon?
---
No. The new animations are clearly much more dynamic. The overall posture and gestures are the same but that's it.
---
There will for sure be an add-on for that
---
Think about it your in a raid, got 38 people to organize while you wait for the last 2 to log on. While setting up groups getting loot reservations making sure everyone has consumables. You’re getting spammed with “”SOANDSO REQUESTS TO JOIN YOYR GROUP” every 5 minutes. 
---
Raid leading is a headache as it is without adding more complications on top.
---
STV easily. I really like theme and quests there. It's pretty place. But at least 50% deaths while leveling happens in STV. Things might be a tiny bit better now when in launch no one is too high level yet.
---
Most streamers (the bigger ones at least) will most likely roll PvE too, otherwise it's going to be a gank fest on them. 
---
The likes of Asmongold has already said this, so that may not be the answer to all your prayers there.
---
Dude this happened to me, all my neighborhood friends started getting into drugs and shit around the time I got into WoW. 
---
But it didn’t affect me because I never went outside lmao, then we drifted apart, obviously was for the best
---
of course they won’t make separate subscriptions nobody would be playing retail come August 27th.
---
Can't touch this..
---
Pally : up for bubble down for hearth 😆
---
Interesting. Hadn't seen that. I'll try to pick a server WITHOUT a streamer
---
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
---
I wish they would bring these to retail, I don’t care if a small minority would complain that they take longer than the current flight path flying, these are infinitely better.
---
That's a pretty petty reason, 'I prefer the old models so you must suffer for it.'
---
lol horde players say the exact same thing.
---
You can still roll on a PVP server without the streamers. Something tells me that for the purposes of content they will most likely be on the same server. 
---
I will be leveling slowly as well. I will have two different characters one for world leveling and one for when I want to dungeon grind. If you get ganked on one go on the other.
---
This is pserver meta, it's incorrect due to wrong values. Progression tanks will require full prot avoidance build.
---
I'd assume there would be aome sort of scenarios where you could enable and disable the feature. For instance on the fly world pvp etc. But yeah I see pros and cons to it.
---
If the leader doesmt care whois joining he will either have to scroll thru and find the person in chat and right click invite or just click accept.
---
Wait until tomorrow and ask this in the weekly thread...
---
DM, I never saw anyone say DM for Dire Maul. It was only DM:W, DM:N, DM Tribute Run etc.
---
#83 days
---
Same here
---
much higher now
---
People who value nostalgia over everything else are so annoying.
---
Those models are dogshit compared to today's standards. The old animations were playstation 2 era.
---
Seeing as how you don't do it solo, you cannot reliably gauge this. A large part of how much time it takes will depend on how much time you personally want to put into it and that will also dictate what kind of Guild do you join and what kind of people you play with
---
*My immersion tho*
---
It is normal practice and it also why the main tank is normally a high ranking member of the guild and not just some rando. The guild takes a lot of risk with the MT (for good reason) so they normally want someone they have faith in.
---
I'm gonna have to do the same.  Today I was enjoying my first play through of breath of the wilds until 4 hours ago when I watched a madseason video and now it's almost 2 am and I'm in this thread.
---
note:  T1 ear is easy to get, tier 2 is fairly easy to get. so don't let these doom stories about tier 3 put you off, just pick a class with a nice tier 2 looks.
---
Pretty sure Healadins are great single target aka spot healers or dedicated MT/OT healers. However in a raid setting they were basically just there for buffs. Priests and Druids held down the raid heals (speaking from alliance perspective well since pal lies are alliance only). Healadins are strong in 5 mans and PVP though.
---
It's not Ironfoe but still a sort of pre-raid BiS. And when you have some of them you perform better in dungeons when like doing lava runs for Ironfoe. One of our main tanks wanted Ironfoe, other Felstriker and they did over hundred of such runs, some of them before 60 but with the help of the guild and some level 60 people.
---
Ahh shit I'm in luck. I have a level 63 berserker in bdo.  Hundreds and hundreds of hours of the most repetitive grind area is a walk in the park ;~;
---
You only level as mostly Ret. Your endgame role is as a healer.
---
Huh? Berserk is very good for Rogue.
---
I could listen to the bow sound in classic for hours
---
It's funny that is the case. Hunter is the only class I've never taken to at least 20 before. I've never taken one to level 2 even. I guess for OP, it can always be worse.
---
I'd guess orc is most played by a large margin.  Trolls and Tauren will probably be pretty close.  Maybe something like 50% orc , 25% troll , 25%  tauren.  Complete guess
---
Only 19070976 damage wat a nub 👀
---
Level as combat and try to keep all of them somewhat leveled. Then decide what spec you want to go into at 60. If you go sub or sin, go daggers. Combat, go swords primarily
---
Oh hells no, paladins were the strongest single target healers and scaled with Crit like no other. Druids were dead last competing with shamans for that last spot.
---
Thanks for the guide! I really hope the auto shot timer addon will be available in classic!
---
I’m on beta. That’s not what I’m talking about at all.
---
Damn.. I wish human females were real
---
Clean bro
---
This made me lol, Barrens chat was a cesspool morning n my server. But it was entertaining to watch.
---
!Remindme 5 months
---
IIRC the mods I had loaded at launch were Titan Panel and OmniCC, both of which are available on WoWInterface for classic.
---
No it is not. Layering is not to reduce congestion. Layering is to reduce the amount of launch servers and the potentiality of merging low pop servers. It’s an operational cost thing, period. A layer will have 3,000 people on it. That means you’ll have (on launch night) around 200-400 people in your starting zone. How is that not insanely congested. It’s beyond critical mass. Layering doesn’t mitigate this. It essentially premerges servers. Period. 
---
Sharding deals with congestion or lack thereof. It’s a method to balance our population of a particular zone or area. It has nothing to do with server populations. 
---
I understand you’re confused, and feel the need to downvote out of embarrassment, but please just do some more research before trying to bend definitions.
---
Then play a class that can stealth, if you dont like getting ganked.. Or as play on a PvE server as you said.. No reason to complain about it.. The people who always complained about things like this are what made BfA to what it, and is why no one plays it.
---
Nice math. 
---
&gt; You'll want to get into a guild that will actually be able to reach Naxx. It's going to be difficult 
---
I assume that there will be spots open for late-comers, especially if the prediction of guilds falling at Vael and others comes true. A possible shortcut to full T3 is to catch up in ZG/AQ20/raid on farm and skip as much of MC, BWL and to some extent AQ40. However, there is probably no way around doing your time in Naxx and there is the conundrum of you needing a spot in a stable guild, when a stable guild ideally wouldn't have an open spot to begin with.
---
Ressembles =/= is. 
---
I’m well aware of where it came from, my guy.
---
At some point Blizz gave hunter pet at level 1 and ability to shoot point blank, but not in classic.
---

True, I keep flip flopping between warrior and rogue and my gf has mage on lock lol
---
??
---
No instant cast dot in classic applies damage instantly. The first tick occurs me global after application.
---
Did they say how many different server we get?
---
Diablo II and Civilization IV were the reason I had a clock on the wall in my study.
---
Well you asked for "togglable updated textures" and it's literally in the game right now with a togglable button lol. 
---
I apologize for not having a psychic link to your brain stem.
---
If wont be ingame on launch, then someone need to port [this one](https://github.com/gashole/TimeManager) to Classic.
---
I would do it... but I'm not in the Beta
---
Um think you missed where I said “Alliance perspective” they didn’t have shaman. Just like Horse didn’t have Paladins until TBC.
---
Just all the retail players coming over
---
I only have mine back in the Wrath days [but I shudder to think what it looked like before I got a widescreen monitor...](https://oi5.photobucket.com/albums/y178/bterrik/WoWScrnShot_042610_224758edited2.jpg)
---
I did label the mods though for some reason which is kind of interesting as a history piece.
---
To me, a priest is an old guy in a robe and that's why I would play one as a male human. I know other racials are better but I simply don't care about them. The difference isn't as huge as people think and the racials will mostly be normalized by the time classic tbc comes out. And by that time I dont wanna have a character that I hate to look at. Simple as that
---
Join a PvP server, it's the highlight of Classic..
---
Fun story but...
---
&gt;she is married with a kid in a different country now
---
SHE GOT MARRIED TO A KID?
---
I think people who are hoping to have the exact same social dynamics as they had in 2005 are going to be disappointed.
---
Modern MMO perspective is going to change things a lot.
---
As far as toxicity goes, I think most people rn just don't have much better to do than watch and post about streamers while they wait for release, it's not very good for the community but it will pass.
---
Pick picketing slows your kill rate down to much imo. Unless you're sub spec.
---
&gt; The world record speed was 4.3 hours "per level". 
---
I thought it was slightly under 5 days played, which translates to 120 hours total or 2h per level.
---
So if you compared all 4 healing classes in vanilla. Paladins were by far number one, priests number two and Druids with shamans number three when it came to pure HPS. Yes I am aware of the class restrictions. But HPS is universal statistic. So again paladins were the best at converting mana into HP at the fastest and most efficient way.
---
They also dont get dps or "farming" gear, i was MT of my guild back in the day and i got all my tank gear over others, but all my other gear which i needed to farm, PVP etc etc was either rewards, pvp, rep gear or 5man when i did get a 2h sword or some dps plate is was when the other 8 warriors or pally didnt need it
---
 greedy ? hell no, i got lucky and got most my might on 2nd MC clear + t2 pants
---
I just created a list of games I should beat before classic and work on that backlog. The release date is a good deadline to set for not only gaming goals, but real life goals as well.
---
The UI is gray stone with two Griffons.
---
Sorry but Alliance is canon.
---
If TBC comes out.
---
Basically what I had suggested myself with getting T1 and T2 quickly. If OP wanted to, like, take a year off and then hope to get geared up fast as a new recruit, that's technically possible, but the method I outlined is the "surefire" way of being a core Naxx raider in a very good guild. Of course OP would need to be able to assess that the guild they're in *is* one that's capable of clearing Naxx, but the progression-minded guilds on a particular server should become readily apparent after they all set themselves apart by clearing MC in the first month.
---
I had my fun with PvP servers. They were fun when my friends and I had the ability to be online together and the shenanigans that we had PvPing were worth their weight in gold. But I want to have my experience this time with less corpse running due to ganking and more about pulling 2 mobs instead of 1.
---
Managing your health and positioning mobs is all that’s left on live.
---
Classic had all that and threat management.
---
I played heals in raids from vanilla to naxx25. I had to heal a number of heroic and now mythic fights since then. 
---
I dunno, disc is fun, having to heal and dps, but meh, I liked mana management and primarily single target heals.
---
That is awesome! I wonder what the other zones FPS are like.🤔
---
Doesnt mean it wouldnt have happened otherwise but he still deserves the credit. It doesnt mean that the third reich wouldn't have happened without hitler. Thats just a dumb argument because technically everything in history could have happened through someone else eventually.
---
!remindme 82 days
---
Not vanilla screenshot
---
mining/herb for gold for mounts
---
The only popular loot system that would do this is loot council and it has plenty of flaws.
---
Until Naxx, there's really no reason that a guild in a raid with another raid phase not incoming for several months should feel the need to think about giving tanks priority on loot.
---
We're planning a week one rag kill and have zero bias on loot. You make a ranked list of all the gear you want, whoever has the highest ranking wins. [It's not that simple](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/), there is some bonus to attendance, but it's relatively small.
---
Skinning. That's it.
---
Streamer servers *laughs in european*
---
There's a video by Kargaz which has sources from other content creators about this. Argues that windfury isn't 'that' efficient with 2h weapons as the damage isn't consistent and a lot of the time may end up overkilling. Windfury will always be better in the sense of rng, but if you want consistency, rockbiter with a 2h is good.
---

I'm not sure Blizzard can recreate that this time around I'm afraid.

---
The twitch app. Twitch bought curse
---
You'll be better off with skinning/one of the gatherer professions,since you can only track herbs or ore
---
Damn, I don't know how I failed on the math there. Yes. 4d20h is the record (at least for official Vanilla). Blizz-like Pservers have gotten it down to 3d20h.
---
Neither of these records is likely on launch though.
---
Some of the structures are too regular and not enough thick, but the cartoon art sytle can be kept while adding the polish.
---
Well yes, but what I mean is, how can someone possibly get a head of the curve when there’s 6 or 7 people camping one mob spawn initially?
---
/g WHALECUM!!
---
Can't imagine it's easy to run a business where everyone sells you their crap and buys nothing in return.

Play something I did not play much of the first time around. Use different character names. Do my very best to not have a checklist of items that I want to check off as I level up and play, and just have an organic experience. If I feel called to stop leveling at 43 and just hang out in Westfall and hook up with deadlines groups to help them through four a couple weeks, do that and enjoy it.
---
Amen
---
Looks cool but not same feel, that's a no from me.
---
Played a resto-Shaman all through vanilla. They don't do well DPS-wise.
---
Especially the new orc models look great. Their faces look rugged and menacing now. They did a great job of maintaining the Disney art style Warcraft is known for, but the models’ new faces often are not simply an upgrade from the old face, but an entirely new face. I think this and some of the more bounch animations are what some object to.
---
Yeah, that's why I'm not trying to recreate or recapture it. My hope is to meet new people and make new friendships and enjoy myself and contribute in ways I find meaningful.
---
Also if you can get group fast (have friends to group with) doing instances might be better than fighting forty ppl over one mob.
---
I have thought about one dynamic I am looking forward to that will possibly change. And that is having people Druid or pally tank, or shaman heal in 5 man groups. I can only speak for my experience on my server back in 2005ish, and that is there was no room for people to try something outside the norm. But now that retail wow has a variety of classes playing multiple roles, maybe people will be more keen on the idea to do stuff outside the box this time around.
---
I am not a native speaker so pardon my mistakes.
---
It was a joke, no problem! :) Your English is fine.
---
I agree they all have new faces rather than simply the old ones upgraded. The rest of the body is just the same, though, with more polys, textures and bones.
---
While I agree that Skinning is a prime choice, you can do Mining+Herb fairly easily. Just make a macro that swaps tracking, bind it to a key, and have AHK press it every half second.
---
Re-watch Narcos?
---
Considering your post history says you “lied on your resume about attending college because you never had the time or money”, I’m gonna call bullshit on this story. Yikes
---
I was playing on a not so public server this morning doing RFK. Our tank was a level 30 tauren warrior who had corpsemaker and spent the entire time in battlestance. 
---
Even though our healer protested he kept chain pulling. I'd come along as a dps warrior but had to switch to sword and shield every time he died. 
---
About half way through he had to hearth and repair because his gear was all red. 
---
No point here other than the fact that people do think they can chain pull in vanilla and do it really badly.
---
I really hate it. Not only does it chuck out the distinct art style, especially in the architecture, it has that obnoxious overly glossy, high contrast look to it that you see in literally every game aiming for realism nowadays.
---
^^^^, this is what I did. skinning is good if you can get those devilsaur racks
---
Despite the technical updates, they fit really well due to having the same exaggerated art style and colours as the surroundings, just like the old models.
---
You didnt knew because you sucked in vanilla and after that the world was not scary anymore and you could aoe these packs of murlocs anyway.
---
But good tip. I sucked aswell.
---
Ofc you can play both at once, wtf?
---
Could be they are using a client with a non-english locale.
---
If you have the time to it's worth looking into using spellID instead, as that will port to all regions.
---
If you are friendly and make friends with them I mean it's a social issue we can't really predict how every single player you meet will react to your abilities
---
I would love for a tutorial for shadowmeld combos
---
Take my upvote, my fellow vanilla-sucking brother.
---
You just summed up the case... And then basicly said "have common sense, let it go". Where's the actual argument? Can you tell me why your logic automatically is common sense?
---
There are dicks everywhere, everywhere. It's up to you to help craft the community experience you want by blocking people. The fact that server communities will be all the more important and influential means that if somebody is an a****** their name Will quickly spread.
---
Level with Skinning + Mining, vendor or combine all the leather before Heavy Leather then start mailing it to an alt.
---
If your leveling pace makes Mining impossible (likely), then drop it for Enchanting and DE any quest rewards and old gear that aren't worth vendoring. Don't actually level Enchanting though. 
---
When you ding 60, drop Enchanting for Mining again.
---
Farm all the mats required for 300 Engineering + whatever trinkets and other weird shit you want to make, then drop Skinning for Engineering and boost it up.
---
If you're not a heavy grenade user, you can then drop Mining for something else, but I'd keep it and do BRD stealth runs for Dark Iron Ore.
---
Many of the faces look very goofy. Particularly humans and orcs. But with the beard options you can make more of the human faces work.
---
So why should one be restrained, while the other much more public figure isn't?
---
It's pretty obvious by the context of this reddit post for a toggleable option for better graphics, not downgrading, especially since he said 
---
&gt;togglable new updated textures.
---
Not given beta access
---
It's not for petty reasons. I believe that a shared world brings a sort of connection between players that is lost when people see different things.
---
Dude, you should really read the bluepost. They have drastically reduced the costs, lol.
---
Neither. Just explore and have fun.
---
And your argument? Man up and defend your reasoning, instead of throwing insults.
---
Ignorance :)
---
I think I just fixed that. It was a rushed mistake when trying to fix the issue where when a haste buff applied in combat would mess up the timers. I'm going to bed but the fix is in GitHub. I'll put out a release with the fix tomorrow morning.
---
Is it bad that I am thinking of rolling warrior just for Dreadnaught?
---
I need some  :/
---
Comunities are build on servers. Reddit or the forums are to global.
---
Communities will form, names will be familliar, people get server fame and guilds will be loved/feared.
---
But it takes times.
---
!remindme 84 days
---
I want to pick every class god dammn.
---
I started in early WotLk as a Belf pally, then i switched to Death knight and warrior, which i mained all the way to legion.
---
Warrior playstyle turned very different from those  expansions on compared to vanilla.
---
So i might pick Rogue, Shaman or Mage instead..
---
Which is fine if you watch threat
---
Gayyy, just enjoy the game.. whats the point of this pseudo elitisism? Every masochist can do this
---
So ypur idea is to keep spending 60$ on new AAA games which you will almost all of them play for less than 50h in your lifetinme. While classic you'll probably play at least 100h per month for 15$ only is a problem?
---
Not in MC/Ony/ZG, fury/prot (1hander and shield ofc) is perfectly viable in the first raiding tier.
---
Ice blocks, frost novas, blinks away again, AND then sheeps you
---
If enough players report you? Yeah they will ban you.
---
Except it already is a shared world, you seeing a quilboar and me seeing the same quilboar will be the same thing, just because I can see a higher polygon count and a better texture resolution doesn't mean we do not see the same world.
---
I'm holding judgement on whether or not Devilsaur Leather is going to be any sort of decent income at launch. It's probably going to be hotly contested by both factions, requiring a larger team (which eats into profits), and with raids being so easy, getting the absolute best pre-BIS gear isn't going to be necessary, dropping demand quite a bit.
---
I like it!
---
ANOTHER ONE !!! (please =p )
---
I liked that the model improvements allow the casting animations to look less glitchy. Ie. no shoulders clipping into their chest or Voldemort putting the Cruciatus curse on them.
---
I think that’s what makes it fun. No PC police to constantly censor people. If i don’t  like someone I ignore them.
---

Locke Lamora from Gentlemen Bastards? I can't think of any Locke older than that. Dope fucking book, but it's not exactly something everyone read. Hell, most people don't read period. If you ask someone about Harry Potter, you are going to get a movie fan 90% of the time. I may be decently read, but even I haven't bothered with the HP books either since I have already seen the movies....
---
If you meant someone else, there's probably a lot of Locke's, tbh. Someone could have thought you were John Locke from LOST as well and wondered why you weren't a Hunter.
---
Oh god imagine the framerate
---
It's only for the beta it will not be there at launch, already said in a Blue Post.
---
Only thing that's staying is colourblind mode.
---
We are enjoying the game, in our own way. The only "hardcore" PVE left in Classic is going to be speedruns and speedkills. Loot lists are the absolute fastest and drama free loot system for this.
---
From my experience what you say is not entirely true. While the chance they run like you say might be very high it still happens reasonably often that they run to the sides or even "through" my toon. 
---
I do agree that your mentioned strategy does save you from a corpse run reasonably often.
---
It’s kind of like the new Star Wars movies. Sure, it looks like the real thing on the surface, but when you go deeper, everything is so different it’s essentially a new game/setting.
---
leveling can be a rather broad category - leveling just  outdoors?  levelilng mainly in instances?  leveling with a lot of pvp/bg's too?
---
outdoors?  combat (no backstab), swords or whatever, since you will rarely be behind something.
---
instances?  spec for imp. backstab, the subt. talents that apply to same (and ambush), etc., and prepare to have pissed off tank when you continually pull aggro.
---
lots of pvp too?  I found subt. to bring so much situational utility/control.....too much fun.
---
Fuck this shit another small thing which is bad for the Immersion
---
it's mostly just that you're playing rogue.
---
tirisfal glades is among the fastest 1-10 of all the races.
---
But where does that end? Because quest tracking add ons etc are a thing and also exist in retail.
---
Just leave it as no changes and leave it be.
---
The only issue is class trainers. For example dwarfs can't be Mages so there are no mage trainers in the dwarf starting area.
---
Thats something to keep in mind.
---
What I do: 
---
Move forward on W, strafing on A and D, S as backpeddal (not optimal but sometimes I use it for some pixel perfect positioning.
---
Basic spells on 1-5.  Niche basic spell on 6. E and shift E as defs, R and shift R for small cooldowns, T and shift T for bigger cooldowns. F for cc break, G for ohshit button, Q and shift Q for CC/interrupts. F1 - F5 for other stuff, mouse buttons for support/utility spells I tend to cast on mouseover. V, Y, C for pet control or different spells like brezz etc.  ; for stopcasting. H for mount.
---
People don't prioritize gear to main tanks based on greed. They do it because it is a good idea.
---
If your main tank is flakey, greedy or has RL stuff pull him from the game that really sucks.
---
I’m in winterspring leveling my hunter on a private server.  They’re right...it sucks.  There is a curse some of the mobs can put on you that stacks and lasts 30 seconds.  If I get more than two I can’t even eat fast enough to not die.
---
Your wife is saint. Gratz ^ ^
---
There's nothing "fun" about racials slurs, homophobia, sexist comments, IRL death threats, and all the other insensitive verbal abuse that happens on Pservers without consequence.
---
Isn’t this actually a bad idea? Sure you might get 31 quicker, but now you’re missing out on all the XP you would have gotten from the mobs you killed for the quests, and in the long run you’ll need more quests and possibly grinding to get to 40.
---
Raptor mount or wolf?
---
if your casual pve is alright
---
but if you can play say 2-3hours a day try get into a group form a army to fight back the filthy gankers  
---
butter up to some 60's and have them fight for you  
---
PVP is much more satisfying of course it depends what your ingame goals are
---
I guess I just disagree with the fundamental basis of your argument.   
---
I don't think price is the main, or even a very big determiner of whether or not most people play a game. It could be a one time $80 purchase, a subscription, or F2P/microtransaction model. If the game is worth it in the grand sense of, are you having fun? how satisfied do you feel after completing x y or z? do you feel immersed in the world? do you feel compelled to come back?   
---
If a game can have you answering all of those questions with a quick yes, then why wouldn't you play it? Regardless of the business model (within reason) if it's compelling, people will pay.   
---
The service WoW provides isn't as solid and objection as it is with other subscriptions where there's a clear you pay $X for Y service. The experiences people have with WoW are equally similar as they are different. It just depends on the person, place, and time in the game. So naturally people will argue the value of what the monthly sub cost *should* be until the day the game servers go offline. I just don't understand why people get so invested, emotionally, in all this. Don't like it? Don't pay for it. Because every business model has its downsides, and I'd MUCH rather WoW be sub based rather than a single time purchase or just another F2P game riddled with even more microtransactions than it already has...
---
It's not a just a higher polygon count. The models and animations are actually different right?
---
Fuck off with this only opinion that matters garbage. I'm not saying my opinion is the only one that matters anymore than anyone ever is when they express they'd like something a certain way, fuckwit. Besides, has the classic team actually confirmed they will allow retail models because I didn't think they had?
---

Personally, Blizzard’s choice to go with a cartoony Disney like art style in WarCraft 3 and going forward with it when they made Vanilla WoW is the reason the original graphics still look decent today despite their low fidelity.
---
here's the part where warrior + healer duos will be pissing on everyone's party  
---
love it!!
---
It's actually from the series with enders game in it.   After enders game it branches off to him and his sister and to his brother who stays on Earth and a few other key characters.    Locke is his online personas name and I absolutely love him. 
---
My wife and I always love re reading Harry Potter. Personally I found book six and seven to be incredible and re read it yearly.   
---
I've never watched lost.  When I made this character it was month one of wotlk, idk if lost was about then.
---
I was an enchanter so had crystals from old kit as rep grinds are not fun
---
Nothing wrong with rolling on a PVE server as long as you understand it's a lower difficulty setting for the game.
---
Imo, if you get burned out now you’ll get burned out on release after a short while regardless.
---
 !remindme 85 days
---
Most streamers have realized this and just resorted to dungeon grinding.
---
IRL death threats is a new one to me. Sounds like trolling. Agree on the other stuff you listed though as I’ve seen it all. I just hope everything isn’t reported and labels as “hate speech” like this country is heading because every has their panties in a wad. I admit I’m less sensitive about it though. I enjoy a little banter and shit talking.
---
As far as i know, only certain mobs flee directly opposite of the direction they face. Some mobs flee in a complete random direction
---
If 8-10 feel slow, imagine that when you ding lvl 51 you only gained 2/3 of the total experience to reach lvl 60 :D 
---
Don't thank me for the info, I like to boost people morale \^\^
---
More seriously, the first 30 lvl of a rogue are particularly harsh, UD zones are even a little bit harsher than the other newbie zones.
---
Things get better at lvl 20 and onward.
---
Cute!
---
They would’ve done it already if not for Tips’ tournament and the implications it had. Streamers realized same faction players would grief it like what happened with Tips, and nobody really knew a solution. So nothing ended up happening.
---
This was upvoted?  Wtf
---
(Scans image to see if my character is there) I was on Smolderthorn way back then! My first realm, I had totally forgotten about it. Thanks for the feels
---
The problem is that Blizzard changed a lot of the game to make everything easier based on comments on the boards instead of standing by their guns and saying "no" they just gave everyone what they wanted and well.. look at it.
---
So these same people are in here asking for changes on classic, I bet theres people asking for LFG.. anyway.. no changes it's not hard to grasp.
---
This is a "port" not a fucking remaster.
---
Looks like it did a very good job of holding your aggro.
---
Getting told to die and burn your computer is light. I got blessed with multiple forms of cancer in diffrent stages. Some aids on top and ofcourse, become a victom of a gangrape.
---
It has always been like this, expecially in Battleground. Because everyone plays for diffrent reasons. 1 guy wants to win because he is hardcore. 1 wants to farm kills on there GY. 1 wants to explore out of the zones and 1 guy want to test his class on level 10. 
---
Fun thing is, there is no timer and you are not entiteld to a lose or a win. If you dont have fun, leave  wait and requeue.
---
Description: Button didn't work.

&lt;End of Bug&gt;
---
i don't feel like buying a gaming PC to play wow, so no thanks :D
---
Always leveled my rogues solo which in turn made me want to go combat since mobs always attacked me.      
---
A nice slow main hand goes a long way with sinister striking while leveling.
---
Word.
---
Yes I was impressed with the system, thats why I read the whole thing. Your guild scared me tough and I would like to be as far away from it. It sucks out all the romanticism and feel out of community. They just want to be the best and will ruin the game for themselfs and the rest. Who gives a shit about these things. Your sheets are cool and dedication welcome. I just think this would be unhealthy for community. I dont want to be on your server, but I go pvp anyway. So im protected I guess
---
Like the same guilds and people do in Retail. Selling runs.. Blizzard only allows this, because it moves Tokens.. They cost the same thing. Its a disgrace and one of the many factors destroying WoW and these "hardcores" will ruin classic for themselfs before everybody els. They should go play DarkSouls, Sekiro and Nioh.
---
OK! i'm sold, will try this at launch
---
It has to be depressing to have nothing but vidya in your life.
---
In you main hand, you want the largest weapon damage you can get. Slower weapons like swords and maces are better for this.
---
In your off hand, you simply want the highest DPS you can get.
---
The best leveling spec gets Riposte at 20, Blade Flurry at 30, Adrenaline Rush at 40, and then goes into Assassination for Imp SND, Relentless Strikes, and Lethality. Not until level 58 do you put a point into any weapon specialization and usually it's swords.
---
Time is money friend
---
Blizzard isn’t the first company to do this QT. OSRS did the same thing and the numbers for RS3 PLUMMETED. An estimated 30-40% of RS3 playerbase is also bots 
---
*smile face*
---
Why would you rush to 60?
---
I was thinking in the game overall. It's in the bottom 3 since it's split between shaman and paladin.
---
It feels counter intuitive not to give priority to your MT especially when you want to be first on Rag.
---
Which I'd bet you will not kill in week 1, it's technically impossible.
---
I agree with you to some extent. 
---
My own experience is as follows:
---
If you are standing inside the mob, there is a chance of it running either way.
---
But it you make sure to be on one side of it, I have never had it run through me.
---
I think it's about the same. The big difference though,  is the people who get upset and call any kind of disagreement toxic. Everything is toxic in video games today. The term didn't exist back then, people were just people , some were assholes other were just having a bad day, but very few were actually a problem that needed to be fixed or moderated.
---
It's ok, thanks for making the game better :)

It’s based on my experience from humanoids and some fleeing insectoids.

Lol comparing wow to runescape.
---
You clearly are coming over from fortnite - majority of anyone that is playing BFA has little to no interest in classic.
---
But Kay, miss analyst ;)
---
There was one where Horde says "A N A L" to ally, can you tell me which one that is?
---
Lol agreed, it’s basically the funny version of aids
---
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
---
I played horde for most of my time on retail, basically all xpacs after vanilla.
---
 my respect for horde has dwindled over the years. Not sorry.
---
&gt; Which I'd bet you will not kill in week 1
---
If you search through my post history, you'll see just how much preparation and practice we have in store for this.
---
&gt; it's technically impossible
---
No, it isn't.
---
&gt; Better threat generation than any of the other horde races 
---
You can't take this for granted based on pserver experience.
---
Judging by the latest revelations about how weapon skill work, I'd bet more on orc than troll.
---
I quickly looked at the list of high end axes, apparently it's possible to find a good axe (too slow for my liking though) in every raid tier.
---
Of course if you get Thunderfury, Trolls are uncontested.
---
Well at least all the time you’re waiting in that amount of queue time can be useful for...something..:
---
1- comparing an MMO that has done a classic version of their game (and yes, OSRS is popular) and it SHOWS that the “newer” version is not as played due to all the poor changes the game has made over time. The DIFFERENCE with WoW is people will come back to major expansions. I still expect a large shift for a while, as should you. 
---
2- “you clearly are coming over from fortnite” lol.... cute attempt to make it look like what I say doesn’t matter. I don’t play fortnite but what would it matter if I did? Who gives a shit what else someone else plays.. this is about Classic WoW being more popular then retail...
---
3- does calling a guy miss get your rocks off or are you just really socially inept to handle any sort of situation where you’re simply wrong, or an idiot... or delusional...
---
Might just be a pserver thing but it happened quite often to me. Played on a German pserver though...
---
Agility is sort of like crit rating
---
Looks like mine :D. But instead of f1-4 I use mouse wheel up, mouse wheel down, middle mouse with modifiers
---
Tauren for "BeCaUsE tOtEmS mAkE sEnSe"  
---
Troll for min-maxing and still not making any significant impact in raids.
---
Orc because lok'tar and your ex-wife Karen will allow you to see the kids on weekends.
---
What is that gay TF?

[EU] [RP(PvP)]
---
I'll be starting my work on planning out a horde hardcore RP guild, and I am somewhat torn between two concepts that I have run at different times during my time in retail wow... 
---
One is a old niche Old God's guild, where we've managed to find a twist on the lore where we convincingly see the old gods as our true saviours (given that "good and evil" is inherently subjective, and I find that you can't rp an evil person/group convincingly by having your character actively seek out what they know is "evil"), and on the surface level, we're a "religion" of sorts, but behind the curtains, we're actively working towards freeing the old gods.
---
The other guild I want to start with is a forsaken/undead only guild, although the exact focus isn't that established, as we found that depending on the members, whether we are a "apothecary guild", "military guild" or a collective org. is very dependant on the type of members we get.
---
I'm posting this because I'm wondering if anyone here is interested in joining in now, either as a regular member, or if anyone wants to join and take an active part in the shared responsibility of building the foundation of these guilds.
---
I myself have both ran (a couple of bigger guilds, and a few smaller ones) and been a member of many RP guilds over the years of wow, and even though I completely gave up on the game after the legion hype, I have been observing both the positive and negative development of wow RP (mostly on the now deserted Defias Brotherhood, and the popular Argent Dawn). If you are interested, please let me know either here, or by DMing me if you are interested.
---
Since I am somewhat torn between the two concepts, the outcome will be determined by most popular request. Who knows, maybe we'll create them both? 
---
We will ofc have an application system at launch, and early members will have to apply there at launch as well.
---
Requirements for officer positions are as follows:
---
***At least*** 2 years of RP experience in wow, the earlier the better.
---
Base understanding of wow lore that goes deeper than the average RPer.
---
20+ years old.
---
Previous experience in a leadership/officer role.
---
The ability to remain objective, and not let your emotions cloud your decision making when it is not directly required.
---
I will also add as a side note that I don't require you to put wow before real life. We all have different priorities, and there are people who can really focus on wow, and there are those who have real life occupations that will take the majority of time of your day, and that is completely understandable and relatable. Although this will be HC RP, we will never expect you to sacrifice your real life over a video game.

Also depends on whether the streamer is us or eu

This is nothing like vanilla, it is missing the at least 5 seconds flapping at a standstill at the destination before getting off. /s
---
Love it
---
That's a solid 3fps setup you had going there.
---
2 tanks for 4HM?
---
On most private servers this is true. Not in classic though.
---
As main profession you should take „who the fuck“
---
And secondary profession you should take „cares
---
1 of 2 brought in
---
i know, im just saying there are people just like you on the other side too :p
---
To add on to that. The only pet skills really worth buying are all the ranks of natural armor, growl and claw/bite. Stamina and resistances gives very little bang for the back during leveling.
---
Hi, /u/Naxugan
---
How do you deal with having a giant mic stand right in your face?
---
I feel like it would either get in the way of your vision or your hands.
---
Fan story, dude!
---
And it forced me to take a look at warlock ;)
---
Oh i got you sorry
---
There is already an addon called ‘readysetding’ that tracks the time to level up and also takes screenshots.
---
Well, you will never get in a 5man dungeon group with strangers as fury/arms because tank is mostly likely a warrior and won’t invite another warrior to compete with his loot. Realistically you shouldn’t roll a warrior unless you are ready to tank dungeons or have a friend that wants to tank and okay with sharing the loot. If you do, you gonna have a bad time.
---
Exactly, if you burnout within 3 months most players here won't even be 60
---
**After august 27:**
---
***Roses are red,***
---
***Glanea is a nolife,***
---
***I didn't sign up for this,***
---
***Get yourself a new wife.***
---
Still can't get that full look of the dwarf guards
---
We're rolling on a PVP server, so no, you're not "protected". 
---
One month, an Alliance guild tried to sabotage our speedrun (they didn't succeed), so our Raid Leader made weekly "homework" of 40 screenshotted kills of anyone in their guild before being able to raid. By the time Darkmoon Faire came around again (the only time we do speedruns), they were offering to be our MC+Pally buff bitches for the rest of the year just to make it stop.
---
And our guild community is fucking fantastic. We have tons of fun. It's only serious business on pulls. Our guild has a lot of people that have no desire to raid beyond a few alt runs, they're just as important to us as the Main Tank.
---
We do plan to sell runs, but only so we get a reputation for good business so we can sell Scarab Lord mounts during AQ opening. That's gonna be the big money!
---
Yes it had no add-ons when I first started playing in vanilla. Because I was a noob and didn't even k ow add-ons existed.
---
Explain this micromanaging, please. What debuffs do you actually need to fill 16 slots?
---
Sunder Armor is a must, as is Faerie Fire. Add the two warlock Curses (Shadow and Elements) and you still have 12 slots. Lets roll with a Recklessness and a Nightfall also, still got 10 slots left. 
---
That’s more than enough for 4 Corruptions and a CoA. That’s how we rolled in Vanilla and as an SMRuin, when I won the roll for CoA I was consistently outperforming mages. And you still have 5 slots remaining.
---
Also a lock with a Nightfall is most likely SM/Ruin, which means no improved imp.
---
So 310 weapon skill needs 6% hit from gear?
---
They doesn't bank and tilt, just static. Here's the original thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsty57/flight\_paths\_are\_very\_very\_bad\_in\_the\_beta\_heres/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsty57/flight_paths_are_very_very_bad_in_the_beta_heres/)
---
Lmao. This is hilarious since I know viet too.
---
When people say its rock paper sissors they mean when both are of equal skill level, equal gear level, equal proffeccion choises ( Engeneer ) equal health/mana, equal cooldowns ready and the list goes on.
---
So its never rockpaper sissors in practise only in theorie.
---
He quotes Decamp &amp;Melderon who have tested it quite extensively. 2H rockbiter with earthbind kiting means you level pretty quick. It can be worth switching to flame tongue for high armour targets at some ranks.
---
this reminds me of like.. people who take pictures of fireworks on the fourth of july
---
It’s not broken, it’s just not leveled.
---
You still won’t get improved imp. You just get to have imp out as SM.
---
That kind of reads like a crazy cult 😂
---
You may be right, but we’ll see. I fondly remember destroying people at 45 with SL, but I can’t remember what I was specced as at 40
---
This is a fairly technical skill so how does this concretely make warriors easier to level? I played warrior only from TBC to Wotlk and never figured this technique out on my own, so does that make warriors definitively easier just because it’s a possibility to use this technique? No
---
It chains and doubles in damage (or triples, you get the idea) every time it bounces, much like C'thun's beam.
---
Stop having simple wipes at the beginning of wc you  scrub noob
---
Thanks for all of your hard work, I'm really looking forward to your character builder!!
---
By this one file, they found she downloaded more files, thus allowing themselves to search all our computers for more, so they could just fuck us as hard as they could.
---
Kind of, I let her dick around on my old account a while back but we never got her full subscription, and since she expressed a desire to play again for Classic we're gonna try to level chars together.
---
What an elitist attitude. If you played tbc and beyond, crit rating was a thing.
---
Let's change the way we live...
---
NO CHAnge....... Fuck it remaster it plz
---
Def curious
---
Thanks, that was a great read! While we won't be able to relive that same sense of awe, I look forward to making some new memories and friends along the way :)
---
Mage I’m assuming?
---
Vanilla was worse in terms of addons covering the entire screen
---
denoise makes it look worse.  
---
its supposed to be parchment
---
Holy toxicity. You're the exact opposite of the type of person anyone wants to encounter in classic.
---
Yah that's where OP remember crit rating from. Tbc. Sorry bro. My bad. You right. Got me. Thank you. You right. Sorry bro
---
Exactly, I'm still gonna take it somewhat easy, even though I consider myself to be a more serious gamer now. I mean I'm excited to experience the game on a more serious level, but I'm not gonna try to speedrun it or anything like that. It's about the journey, everyone should know.
---
Today's streaming and beta has demonstrated instance levelling is actually entirely decent and may even be the fastest way to level if organised, so I'd expect most big streamers to level that way if they want to play on a PvP server. Ganking won't be a problem.
---
Ok that last part almost convinced me!
---
I'm subbing to bfa so when classic releases I will be so eager to ditch that game they call retail wow
---
We had addons on day one of varying quality
---
At 40 there is no way they’ll be clearing endgame/high 50s dungeons. I don’t even think you can enter BRD before level 42
---
Maybe 3000?
---
Hello ! just a quick question : were you subbed when you got the access or not?
---
Or were you subbed BUT cancelled the sub ?
---
We don’t talk about these things...
---
!Remind me 84 days
---
Black Rock is full gtfo
---
Some guilds require raiding add-ons.
---
There are two types of addons: Quality-of-Life and Knowledge. In Vanilla we had a third type, EZMode, that trivialized certain challenging gameplay elements you, but we can't have those anymore thanks to Blizzard changes.
---
QoL addons are just that, they do something in the game that removes an inconvenience. Maybe it's better UI simplicity, maybe it's being able to mail multiple items at once, maybe it's not having your map take up the entire screen, maybe it's being able to /ignore more than 50 people, maybe it's being able to find people for a group without having to spam trade chat, etc.
---
Knowledge addons simply display information the game doesn't provide on its own in a way that can be read and used during gameplay. Combat alerts, health numbers, enemy castbars, precise cooldowns and swing/energy timers, etc.
---
Whether you use QoL addons is up to you. The game is far from perfect and some things WILL annoy you, addons can help. When your goal is to enjoy some great s'mores, do you really care if you started the fire by rubbing two sticks together or by simply using a lighter?
---
Whether you use Knowledge addons will depend on what your goals are in-game. If you plan on raiding, you'll need several addons to make both yours and others jobs easier, allowing you to focus on precision movements and your chosen role's job. If you plan on PVPing, you'll need several addons to be competitive.
---
We will have MUCH better addons in Classic than we ever did in Vanilla simply because of the year we're in.
---
It could always be fast I guess... but it is true - some Levels feel like they take forever while others - even on higher Levels feel like they just fly by.
---
Probably has to do with certain power Spikes due to new weapons and abilities. 
---
Classic just takes time - you shouldn't look at your Level Progression compared to time spend. It's the Overall Picture and things you have done in that session like leveling professions etc.
---
It takes time :P
---
Did you hear about it and wanted to share it? Or did you test it to verify? If tested, did you do it on pserver or classic beta? 
---
Thanks, for the post. This info is nice to have, i just want to check if it's trustworthy! ;)
---
That is f****** adorable.
---
Yeah this is basically the same as retail ( except MC will be butchered by an absolute ton of guilds and Pugs a few months in).
---
For research purposes, I need to know what letter combination is used to say "A N A L" as horde to the alliance in-game.
---
Please help me out on this, it's obviously for science only.
---
Its hard to explain to people that heroic strike costs mpre than 12-15 rage because they dont believe you.
---
No. MC is super easy mode compared to modern standards. BWL isn't even that hard either, AQ20, ZG these are not hardcore.
---
!remind me 85 days
---
How do you know where he was remembering it from?
---
You just assumed.
---
Hahah no you didn't haven't been sub to that trash since wod
---
Wrong, I downvoted because your comment was cringe-inducing!
---
Nice. Yeah I remember you too. I remember fighting you guys for the drakes all the time. Those were good times.
---
Sure, rush something that made classic so amazing. Your loss mate.
---
There is evidence to suggest Ele is fastest levelling spec post 40 because of how poot Enh is.
---
Indeed, 15$ sub fee and no micro transaction bs is a dream!
---
Week 1 will be super had, did it at week2 with about 13 lvl 60 player. Haha now at classic working 50h+ a week I'm happy to clear mc in within 2 months
---
I still have the  Legionnaire title on my warrior :) Pvp was all I did, so I was poor too. But I got my mount at lvl 40, because I was a professional beggar :) I used to beg in Orgrimmar all day long. Few silver here, few silver there...even copper. One day I got 1 gold from an undead rogue called Fosila (I even have a screenshot saved somewhere from that "event").
---
I used to use Dartol's Rod of Transformation to kill players questing and trying to kill furbolgs. 
---
Those were fun times...now it's all about gear. The trade chat is full of boosters and that's about it, absolutely nothing happens anymore. And it's sad, because the vanilla update will eventually be full of boosters and the experience will not be the same as it was back then. You can't bring the feel back, just the limitations and the look.
---
Most guilds will require you to install a threatmeter and Deadly Boss Mods/BigWigs (timers, warnings etc.) if you want to raid.
---
I don't understand your comment i only play vanilla private.  just not a retard.. like you hahahah
---
(laughs in Paladin Seal of Justice)
---
(cries in Paladin Seal of Casino and auto-attack hell...)
---
Depend on skill, gear, rng and the environment
---
The best test enviroment is production.

I mean these are not the new models you fucking sperg. Srsly delete yourself  hahaha
---
If I'm not being super-stupid, isn't the NE village in Teldrassil called Dolanaar, not Dolnaar?
---
SoR scales 10% with so on 1h, 12% with 2h. With MCP that's 12% scaling, on a fast as fuck weapon that also benefits from 2h spec talent, which also boosts SoR damage. SoR also causes essentially double procs on hit, so the effectiveness of things like HoJ/Ironfoe/etc is nearly doubled. Should also work with proc oils but doesn't in the beta currently, though it's most likely a bug.
---
Ah oké bummer. Yeah this guy was right, your more Alike cultist to us, we have no idea to be like you. You are like the Bikers depicted in south park . They think they are the shit, but everybody dislikes it. 
---
Im sorry for being disrespectfull, but I dont like this idea at all. I could have joined the guild if it was interest in playing with the community, not its own bubble. Also in Vanilla it was not allowed to sell runs. So you take your gold and PayPal money, but it means nothing to anyone.. I just hope I manage to avoid the streamers and you guys. 
---
I do like to learn from this work.. but think the way its utilized is toxic.
---
Hey man let's fight about something so futile cause your feeling got hurt that I'm an elitist. So listen here. I am an elitist. I'm one in real life 2. I'm better then you and the OP. Deal with it alright son? Alright dog? Alright son dog? Dogson. Your new nickname is Dogson.
---
I wanna listen to your comments, your thoughts, plans. I will roll alliance which is my experience. Any no lifes here, willing to commit and dedicate your life to cap and hardcore raiding? Plans on how to speed level, best routes, farms, professions. I'm undecided if I take this path which I can't resist anymore. I should live my life, but I wanna go full nerd mode hardcore DPS, make social and make this game great once again. Talk to me community, give me the light, be honest with me, rude, optimistic, realistic. I kniw three percent out there are on the same boat as me
---

Ele/resto build. You heal, you purge, you frost shock for slows, you earth shock for interrupts, drop tremors, grounding. And whenever you feel like it, drop a lightning bolt, chain lightning and delete someone.
---
1 in 3 is 33.3~% chance, not 30%.
---
You can make the argument that it's QoL and should be kept in, but where do we draw the line? Quest helpers? Balancing? 
---
I say we don't need to open that door for something that's not even needed. Just hover over the sun/moon if you want to know the time.
---
Everyone is gonna use a unit frame addon to replace it anyway let's be honest (or almost everyone). It's one of those things that just doesnt matter. 
---
So, so glad request invite is gone. I absolutely hated that.
---
Who pissed in your coffee?
---
So you didn't graduate? Big mistake.. I had a friend who completely ignored uni for WoW back in 2013...I do not even know if he is still alive. He wanted to make me an addict as well, going as far to offer me  buying every expansion with several months of game time lol. Of course I declined because I didn't want to be indebted. That shit was way too expensive for my jobless uni self back then. On the plus side I graduated without problems and got a job now xD.
---
Thanks for the update
---
This guy is OG 👌🏻
---
I'm really not. I think I was pretty respectful and just trying to explain how I felt. When he said the 'only opinion that matters' thing I had enough and had to put him in his place, that's all. 
---
I assure you I can be a very lovely person.
---
Yea, and he does piss poor DPS despite full potting and playing near perfectly.
---
This is awesome, but why does it look like he’s wearing a matching set. This ain’t fashion frame, this is Warcraft! Now put on that cloth hat that gives +5 agility because some popeman was feeling like a monkey
---
Be a man, get a wristwatch.
---
I thought that video was hilarious (because it was cringe af)
---
Hi Lincler12, I appreciate your approach to a thorny topic. To answer your questions. There are no required addons to play any portion of WoW, never have been. Some guilds may require their raid members use certain addons but that’s a different topic.
---
For me personally, I enjoy using mods to adjust my UI in a manner that is more comfortable and appealing to me. I also will use a couple quality of life enhancing addons, but nothing that would give me any advantage over anyone else.
---
Even though there are some addons that I personally wouldn’t use and wish didn’t exist. I don’t believe that I have a right to say what others do with the game on their computer. So no... I would not want to see any addons removed. They have always been a part of WoW. If anyone has an issue with addons they simply don’t need to use them. No harm done.

LOST was back in 2004 and Gentlemen Bastards was around 2006. Locke isn't really a hugely popular name like I said. We both love different books with a character named Locke, but most people we run into wouldn't have read them. Since the movie of Ender's Game was a flop, John Locke from LOST is probably the most well known out of the three, and I am sure there are even more Locke's than those but also or even more obscure. 
---
Really not surprising at all that no one knew what you were named after, especially when people misspell stuff all the time when the original is taken. Lock being the main term for Warlocks and all.
---
I thought they removed that 1% guaranteed miss thing with 4.0 or maybe even earlier, but I can't remember because I'm not nearly as experienced with caster stuff.  I think it was still 17% miss through even Mists, anyway.

I had a similar experience with a NE Druid. Ended up in the cave with Rejuv enemies as part of the Bear form quest. I just ragequit and swore to never play a class without an interrupt again.
---
Selling runs for gold was absolutely allowed in Vanilla. Selling runs for IRL money has never been allowed.
---
Just because we're not playing the game how you want to play it, doesn't mean we're worthy of your insults. You have no idea who we are or what our community is like.
---
You could be the best speedleveler and best [class] player on the server, with that attitude, you wouldn't be welcome.
---
Yes, we take one small part of the game very seriously in an effort to break records and prove to the community what's possible, but that doesn't make us any less a part of the overall community or give you any reason to dislike us at face value.
---
Depends on what you are aiming to do. 
---
If you aren't going to raid much (if at all), then ret is still a strong pick.  You do good in 5 mans (especially scholo and most of strat) and can do some work in PvP. 
---
However, if you want to raid... then not only do you need to pray that some guild gives you a spot "just because", but you will likely be limited to more casual guilds on average unless you can get on the very good side of someone of one of the serious ones.  Not to mention you would have to farm more gold than the average play just to full pot constantly in order to not seem completely worthless on boss fights.
---
Bobby Fischer would have disagreed with you.

It‘s just a repost of a topic asked 20 times a day and that sucks balls, you guys keep spamming away useful stuff.
---
Gz man!
---
To be fair it does get quite tiring seeing the same question posted multiple times a day.
---
We have learned much in the last decade. We have become increasingly fragile with regards to offence, and have developed new ways taking offence. 
---
But, it's a question of degree. At the end, it will bento too different.
---
I've run my equation and determined that 24.7742% of the hype is nostalgia.
---
I read that in Esfand's voice
---
Isn't that the whole point? I've already done Vanilla once on hard mode, it seems extremely tedious to do it a second time.
---
Even more so I don't feel like I got anything out of doing it on PvP, ganking other people was never my cup of tea and getting camped for a few hours by someone higher level than you didn't give you any kind of feeling of accomplishment.
---
As far as I can tell the only thing I can say I got out of playing on a PvP server was some false sense of superiority over people who didn't and now that I am older I realise that is not a good enough reason to do something.
---
Yea, this does not work in beta.  The private server fearing/fleeing tricks wont work.
---
Ganking noobs and lowbies is also part of the game..
---
The new models have numerous new cartoonish attributes such as exaggerated facial expressions and bouncy movements. Some like it and some do not. 
---
Note that this is not really tied to the 3D mesh but more to animations/moves themselves. One could apply the same strategy on a realistic model, or even a live actor.
---
The main tank should be the one to get it.  
---
The drop rate on them is extremely low.
---
Be proud.
---
I wanna find losers like me, fired from job, uni on hold, I wanna live on WoW Classic for a month, saved money for internet bills, and nutrional quick food, strict diet, take some prescribed meds to stay focus on 12~16 hours a day, a lot of farming. I want to live the classic with losers like me. It seems that alliance is the faction underdogs already, anyone out here lurking and can relate to me in some aspects? I don't want to play with someone who has a family, job and things to do. I gotta find a duo who has no life like me, and then get in the best hardcore guild 60
---
Tauren Males got absolutely ruined imo
---
I was already on the verge of MTF on my Tauren and the model update made it 100%.
---
Cool! Ill check it out :D
---
The chance of all of them getting TF is extremely low, if not non-existent. There were whole guilds in Vanilla that never saw a binding drop and guilds that had a few of one, but never saw the other drop. Legendary's in WoW:Vanilla were really just that, Legendary. If there was one person on the server to have a Legendary, it was a lot.
---
While Paladins and Rogues did use it, this was more just a novelty since it just generates way to much threat to be worth it. It really is a tanking-weapon imo.
---
No Foodbuff? 🤨
---
You don‘t need 440 defense, way overshot. 🙃
---
Do whatever you want.. at the end of the day there is nothing to prove.
---
Most people played on PvE back then, and I am sure even more will play this time around.  Those who want forced PvP have that option, but at the end of the day this is a PvE game with a side attraction of PvP.
---
I think the one you're looking for is Ready Spell Omni under animations, it's still there:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=211/vestments-of-transcendence#modelviewer:5+0
---
I'm not sure which spells use it though.
---
Yea, which is why most people roll on PvE servers lol... Not everyone enjoys being camped constantly and being unable to fight back.
---
Mate, wtf you on about
---
You’ll get quite afew MC raids in before you are standing infront of the Horsemen. Most guilds, hell most people that raid regardless, Will do MC every week. Specially those that want Thunderfury. 
---
It should and Will always go to tanks first. Main tank specifically. And im sure you’ll see well over geared t2 tanks carrying MC raid PUGs  with reserved bindnings. 
---
Raids never really become redundant in vanilla due to itemization. A hell of a good feature of the game.
---
Probably all 3 of your friends will get disappointed and reroll when it's too late.
---
Good on ya mate!
---
I’m taking 6 weeks off at the end of the year for annual leave and plan on getting some quality nostalgia time then.

Can you try typing /mountspecial while on the FP? 
---
It used to cause the gryphon/wyvern to ascend before they altered flight paths. 
---
There's no practical use for it, just curious whether they've reverted to a legit older version, or gone to the effort of recreating the movement on the modern flight paths (in which case it shouldn't work).
---
Taurens looks like they're struggling and constantly falling over when they're running.

Did you play thru the Rexxar campaign in WC3? It's basically WoW but in WC3 and single player RPG.

It's amazing.

---
Brady Games would have been working with Blizzard, so the majority of data would have either come from the WoW team or been verified by them.
---
WoW was a PvE game by design with a side attraction of PvP.  PvP servers were added as an option for people who like the griefing aspect.
---
At the end of the day, that is the majority of what happens.. griefing.  On PvE servers, people still camp quest givers which will always start a fight anyway.  So on one hand your quest progression just got halted, and now the threat needs to be dealt with.  On the other, a lvl 60 rogue is camping you as a lvl 25 and there is nothing you can really do about it other than leave... yea, that sure sounds "hard" to me.
---
"Bash" the new word for describing something :)
---
Engineering will not make you money for your 40 mount. 
---
The only market will be anyone that pvps and doesn't take engineering.
---
This is just a bad myth that’s being regurgitated. It was NEVER possible for shammy gear to drop for alliance and vice versa in vanilla.
---
I made 1 level so far. I played like an hour maybe, because its way too overcrowded. You can't do a single Quest without waiting for respawn. I'd wait until the American fatties are in bed.
---
I‘m sure OP is talking about the drop https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3748/feline-mantle
---
upvote because of relevance.
---
Damn homie grats on the month, have fun not feeling rushed!
---
Warrior is extremely gear dependent. However, it's all about where you want to put your ceiling. It's ok if you clear MC and BWL 3-4 months later than the curve and you won't be playing pvp only against the top players. On the other hand, with only 1/week raiding I don't think you will progress further than BWL. That's also fine, T2 or equivalent gear is pretty good to do most of your everyday activities with no problem.
---
Ret is viable, it does more DPS than is required to beat Patchwerk in Naxx.
---
The community will be better... we are all older now.
---
I  launched game again just in case.. :) Now i have this drop down menu in login screen  https://i.ibb.co/pPD06ZP/hmm.jpg
---
Error is stil the same: "No realms currently available (WOW51900309)"
---
No banking or dynamics in flight made it look like a fracking dumpster fire. It looked absolutely attrocious.
---
I think your last statement sums it up.  I would argue most people who played WoW back then (perhaps even today) only really cared about PvE to begin with.  
---
If someone doesn't want to PvP, then they aren't going to roll a PvP server, and that is that.  At the end of the day, most of what happens on PvP is straight up griefing; though to be fair, plenty of griefing will happen on PvE servers as well in the form of quest giver camping.
---
This exacly how the bikers in South Park also reacted..
---
Yes I do think you're worthy of my insults.. You are insulting me, by selling the work and dedication I put in. So you devalue my work, I get to do the same for yours.. Also I do know what it is like, my brother was burned out multiple times and will never play WoW again. Atleast he was the best healer of his prestigious server... 
---
Also I won't be the best speedlvl'er, I like to smoke weed and chew bubblegum. I would be good enough for your guild tough. I know you guys don't like arguement and I have no ambition to join the guild. I like people who take breaks and enjoy what they just did. Instead of being like children and already looking at the nex piece of candy. 
---
Your effort would be appreciated, if you would not try to demeen ours in other to further feed your own insecurity's. Your description sounds like a bunch of Dollar Store Bilionairs to me. It's also possible to not sell runs, to not dominate entire zones and ect.. 
---
I think it's a pitty and I never experianced this raid selling in Vanilla or any previous patch before the WoW token. I think this should be banned with the WoW token. It's makes everything purchaseable. People will just buy Chinese Gold to pay you..
---
I raided in Vanilla and never saw a single binding drop....
---
Then two weeks ago i ran a transmog-run on my rogue and got both bindings in the same run :)  That was the first time i ever saw a binding drop in my 14 year WoW-time... and my rogue got both on the same run... #HappyDays
---
I know in todays retail its "useless" - but it's still a true "Legendary weapon" :)
---
But as many others write here...taking it for granted and thinking that "everyone" will have TF....is just unrealistic
---
Expensive to level, and not many people are gonna items you craft pre 40 due to saving up their money. Im no expert on engi, but id say skinning and herb yeah, concidering the amount of mobs u gonna kill as hunter skinning will make u a nice g
---
If you don't know how to read, I can't help you.
---
I dont see them doing a open beta (maybe last stress test is fully open). The beta is really smooth atm, the problems that it might be are linked to game mechanics and those you can test with even lower level chars, since you have most of the abilities already. L40 would be better, since there are the 30p talents in each tree. I heard something that they might increase the beta max level to 40, but not sure if that was just a rumour. Havent played the beta in past few days, so not sure.
---
isn't the release date the 21th?
---
If they are going to spend the vast majority of their time in instances, then why even roll on a PvP server to begin with?... to be the ones ganking lowbies in the end?
---
You've acknowledged that playing the game on a PVE server is easier than playing the game on a PVP server, regardless of how you play or whether or not you participate in any PVP.
---
Therefore, it's not a false sense of superiority, it's a measure of pride and other emotions. When you hike up a hill to catch the breaktaking view, the combination feelings that person receives isn't available to those that just got in their car and took the fire road all the way up.
---
Being able to opt-out of World PVP whenever you feel like removes a crucial element of the danger in being out in Azeroth. It's training wheels. And every kid remembers when they couldn't wait to get the training wheels off.
---
Hi, /u/Freayce
---
Look exactly how I remember it back in 2004.
---
Hmm, the problem I have with add-ons is that there really is no choice and with that I mean that everyone wants to be the best he can be in this game that's why they play so by not choosing an add on that gives you an advantage you are just not on the same level as others.
---
Note that with wand support, its apparently possible to weave auto attack with auto shoot. If you have a 1.8 speed wand and &lt;1.8 speed weapon. 
---
Not sure if this is something true or worth supporting.
---
Only problem is that you might not want to go back to work after
---
IF, and I mean IF you see bindings drop, it'll go to the main tank of the guild. But the chances of them seeing it drop is pretty slim. Don't expect to get it as a dps, ever.
---
I tanked in Vanilla and tanks were always the number 1 /lf1m.  So the validity of this comment is in question.  Your server was rare?
---
All the characters need are HD textures, and maybe remake the textures with a bit of 3D visual effect.
---
With full HD or even 4k texutres and some smooth 3D visuals on them Characters would look dope.
---
**IF** you put in the time to farm everything out. If not, it's not even close. Also why would you measure the performance of a spec in one fight
---
Warrior is a really fun class to play as, but you have to invest time in it. While leveling the quality of your weapon will always be important. You'll generally use whatever best White you can find until around level 15-20 with a Green from time to time and when you hit around level 40 use the Whirlwind Weapon you have until level 60. Gear is really important while leveling, more than with any other class iirc.
---
Keep in mind if you play casually, it will take anywhere between 3 to 6 months before you reach level 60 depending on how much time you dedicate to leveling.
---
Warriors were THE tanks yes, but don't make the mistake of leveling as Protection. Level as Arms or Fury (lots of guides out there).
---
I have a theory that they're working on that in the Diablo franchise.
---

Hey, the same thing happened. Well, except I listened to the same selection of music while reading the Harry Potter series, always the same 15 songs. Yesterday I was at the mall and one of the songs began to play and I legit involunterily spaced out for like a minute with my brain confused the fuck out.
---
They also explicitly stated they would never do a classic server, and here we are. They have said a lot of things they would never do.
---
• Blizzard said there would never be Classic Servers• Blizzard said there would never be the ability to buy gold (WoW tokens)• Blizzard said they would never allow us to create toons of both factions on PvP servers.• Blizzard said there would never be a way to change a character’s faction.• Blizzard said there would never be a way to change a character’s race.• Blizzard said there would never be a way to change a character’s server.• Blizzard said there we would never be able to switch between a PvP and PvE server.• Blizzard said there would never be Horde paladins.• Blizzard said there would never be Alliance shamans.
---
Engineering wont make gold
---
added, thanks. Video evidence would be great tho
---
I leveled 1-60 on a pserver at my own pace so I have pretty much experienced it already
---
No changes.
---
Might?
---
That's not how you spell won't.

I remember spending a lot of copper and silver on this when I first unlocked it back when I was a kid. I was so hyped to finally fly in this game and I couldn't get enough of it.

Oh man playing on the tv
---
I believe he was actually making a joke example to reinforce your point
---
I did get the option Beta on the app, now it's gone lol
---
Hehe, I know... Hopefully between now and then I can either become super rich off the stock market and retire, or become a professional WoW streamer.
---
I still haven't decided what I'm going to do. On the one hand, PvP is probably going to be a pretty important factor in Classic's longevity. On the other, I kind of just want to chill and PvE is great for that.
---
*laughs in oceanic*

26 gold and raiding. Brings back memories.

&gt; The game is not out yet, but you're already whining on class balance 
---
Wtf? Most of us lived through it. We already know what the game is.
---
This. Pve Servers are so boring and offer no feel of being in danger
---
Rets are Paladins so that is inherently useful. Obviously a Paladin healer is more useful but Rets have Lay on Hands, BOP, Freedom, Salv, a stun, Greater Blessing of Might, auras, plus they can bubble to mitigate deadly AOE damage.
---
Compare that to say a Rogue and while they have a couple nice stuns they don't otherwise bring anything but damage. 
---
I think they were probably going for Ret being a class that could throw in some off heals inbetween DPS because they have so much downtime in their rotation but the spec is just too mana starved to do that too much.
---
He’s not wrong though
---
Yes, it will be the most fun. I plan on maxing out fishing and cooking on my main. The entire month off is necessary for me to have a good time.

Everything will be available from the start. You now that we got 6 Phases right? If not gooole "Wow classic phases". These are basically the patches we get, each after 1-4 months. 
---
The only exceptions I can think of, are the epic mounts for Pally and Lock since they require Dire Maul to open, which will only be in phase 2.
---
!Remindme 84 days
---
Ha, I've thought the same thing.  It is pretty crazy.  I don't actually know a lot about casters in Classic WoW, unfortunately.
---
Still, I'm mostly sure that in pure DPS terms it is not worth getting to the spell hit cap if it means sacrificing too much spell damage, but it may feel a bit shitty to see a rather noticeable amount of random misses (shown as Resists before 3.0).  I'm sure there's some kind of sim/calculator for just this.  Surely there are simple stat weights for how much spell damage 1% spell hit is worth in Classic.  Of course there were stat weights for TBC and Wrath, but that was a bit different because of having ratings and other changes to the game.
---
I don't get it
---
Hi, /u/Whatthehek_

I guess you were lucky it wasn't Moon Guard.
---
I plan on rolling hunter as well... and going engi/enchant for end game. 
---
My plan is to run skinning/herbi for leveling. Lots to gather while I level and skinning is a sure way to get lvl40 mount. 
---
Once I’m 60 I’ll drop them both and pick up enchant/engi. 
---
The game plan is to use disenchanting/solo farming to fund my engineering. Lots of gear is replaced very often early on... people enchanting their preBIS and then enchanting their initial epics... so I’m hopeful that enchanting mats prices will be high to begin with.
---
Just think of all the neckbeards who watch pokemane who will probably try out WoW after seeing her play it
---
I dunno about you guys but my time in Barrens will be spent spamming Chuck Norris jokes.
---
&gt;  You are insulting me, by selling the work and dedication I put in.
---
So by that definition, every person that eats in restaurants is insulting those that only cook their own meals at home? What? Just no.
---
You're measuring the "work and dedication" you put into the game based on gear you have that others don't have. Just because others can afford to skip that work and dedication for the physical reward doesn't make your accomplishment any less worthy of pride. Comparing yourself to others like that is a very toxic way to live life.
---
&gt; I like people who take breaks and enjoy what they just did.
---
You have no evidence to support that we don't take breaks and enjoy our accomplishments. If anything, we're *less* hardcore in that regard because we only spend about 3 hours a week raiding.
---
&gt; Instead of being like children and already looking at the nex piece of candy.
---
This isn't what it's about for us. We're always looking for ways to improve regardless of whether the gear matters to us at all. We simply like making challenges for ourselves and overcoming them, that's exactly what an open-world game is all about.
---
&gt; People will just buy Chinese Gold to pay you..
---
We don't support this and Blizzard has a pretty strong stance against it.
---
1:03 makes me wonder if there’s some insurance for gryphon accident in Classic
---
Is this from private servers or the beta?
---
Even when you get to the point of being able to make items other people would buy, so many people are going to be picking Engineering for the combat bonuses in PVE and PVP that the market will probably be oversaturated.  What I'm doing is going Skinning/Mining until 60, then swapping to Alchemy/Engineering (if you also go double gathering, make sure to go skinning; Herbalism+Mining can't track ores and herbs at the same time in vanilla).
---
I am so tempted to do the same but i just dont want to re live some of my 15 years memories on a unoffical server, its gotta be legit, even though the waiting is hurting.
---
Great idea for an extremely useful topic, thanks!
---
titan panel uuuuugh
---
This ^  vanilla content never becomes irrelevant 
---
TF will always be attainable throughout the game
---
 but those bindings HAVE to drop.  Its a crap shoot.  Most bindings I saw were on my dps in my 2nd or 3rd MC of the week
---
If thats your concern I would probably wait until December before trying to play WoW classic
---
How do you CC a hunter as a Priest? RNG Blackout procs?
---
WoW was not a PVE game by design, if you read the developer diaries, they actually had no intention of making PVE servers.
---
Reddit.... the only place in the whole internet in which u/CharlieTheHomeless actually works in the stock market.
---
I love it.
---
That gryphon is going to take someone's head off!
---
Gather herbs, mine or skin. Then drop them at Max level for engi/mining or whatever combo you want. 
---
I plan on skinning and mining, vendor/AH skins, collect mining goods as I lvl. Drop skin and level engi with whatever I collected then keep mining to replenish my nukes to drop on ppl in PvP
---
I'm so gonna steal this idea for my GF, hype it up babes!
---
I love this.  I don't care if it makes flying take a bit longer, it's just that much more immersive this way.  Taking a flightpath should feel more like a small "journey", good stuff!
---
I don’t understand how so many people love the new running animations. The recent change to the orc run animation is horrible yet every reddit thread I saw was praising it saying it looks more “orcish” and scary. It’s just bad running form, I can’t even play Tauren’s anymore because it looks so poor. 
---
To me something that big running with proper form looks more menacing. The poor form just looks goofy and dumb.
---
ElvUI is being ported. So its possible you could configure that to look like schism. 
---
However keep in mind you are really going to want 4 action bars worth of slots (48).
---
When your goal is to enjoy some great s'mores, do you really care if you started the fire by rubbing two sticks together or by simply using a lighter?
---
Hmm I thought this is the reason that retail is boring and people choose classic over it. Having an addon that finds you a group in my opinion will make it easier for people to leave the group in the first problem they encounter.
---
As of knowledge add-ons can't experience replace them in some way? Wouldn't the game be harder and more fun without those? My real problem is with these add-ons. 
---
I would really like blizzard having options for these things like ui customization and the mail option to send more items should just be implemented in the game
---
People will (hopefully) chill out once Classic is live. Probably a lot of angst just from people waiting to get in.
---
I knew about the phases but last time i looked at them it was all about when the raids and pvp would release, said nothing about the quests in the world.  
---
So everything available from the start? Nice, thanks!
---
Thanks! I’m book marking this to check out later.
---
&gt;Ty ty!

---
"We'll build a wall and make the night elves pay for it"
---
Their new run animation adds to the dumpy oaf too
---
&gt; Private servers have been proven over and over to be a lot more wrong than you thought. They are NOT vanilla.
---
I had more than 100d played in the first year of vanilla on my priest alone, so believe me, i know vanilla. And i know private servers too. Claiming that they are totally different is just plain idiotic. There might be some different values to threat, melee damage etc, but the main core of the meta doesnt change. Ppl that played on private servers will have a HUGE advantage on everyone else.
---
Classic isnt going to be like vanilla. In vanilla we were in the dark, i DIDNT know that i could use a L25 healing item in NAXX on healing debuff boss. Or that i should stack up certain resistance potions. You have ALL possible information in front of you, giving you absolute BIS lists for the next 1.5-2years. Every instance will be cleared within HOURS of release. MC will be cleared on FIRST reset.
---
You say vanilla is not private servers. Heck, Classic wont be like vanilla either. Classic will be 1.12+ version of vanilla, in good and in bad. I think Decursing addon was disabled at that stage in vanilla too, or was it in 2.0 pre patch. Cant remember, it was long time ago.
---
The same type of attitude that looks at gear score and determines how good a player is.
---
Find a new job
---
Pretty great. Except SW doesn't have a harbor. :P
---
Bro the samophlange quest is only cool if you are deep into thundercats references. I feel that without a group to deal  with the adds, you are going to waste a bunch of fucking time in those oil fields. The levels from 15-24 can be done in less frustrating areas. this is all, of course, just my opinions bro.
---
Wrong. There is a fucking single Beta-Server and lots of Americans play on it right now. 1-30 was way better than today and I will play on a German Server anyways, so no Streamer-Fanboys etc.
---
Yeah, but that can be done once every ½-1 month or so. Still got 2 months and 3 weeks to go.
---
All betas have become streamer exclusives.
---
The only answer I have is cause life isn’t fair.
---
Kinda related, is it common knowledge you face the way you stood when you set your hearth? I always face the door when I set my hearth for convenience but never got to ask anyone else if they do this.
---
There are german servers in retail, they  had german servers in vanilla so Id be very surprised if they dont have them in classic.
---
Really nice vid and might snake me want to play hunter. Keep making videos, you are good at explaining the mechanics!
---
Had a guild mate do that. Made 2500g or something in a single day AFKing in Org. Still NOT RELIABLE at all.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/#fullmenu looks like EPL, silithus and winterspring
---
Well, worst case scenario you can probably farm R14 alone with that much time if you can't find other like-minded people for hardcore raiding lol.
---
Won't be taking meds but plan on playing as much as possible :)
---
Awwww =)
---
Yeah, that sounds right to me.  I think it doesn't matter much early on, like before 25 or so, but it'll matter more and more as you get higher in level, naturally.  I think things suddenly sharply pick up around Level 30, when you can't quite wing it on healing without full healer gear anymore unless the rest of the party's very geared.  And by Level 40, you really need a healing set if you want to heal in dungeons, even if it's simply gear with +Intellect.  Intellect's primary effect in Classic is just +max Mana, but that's still good.
---
While it would be nice to always pick up Intellect or +Healing gear when you can while doing dungeons, the problem is there'll probably always be a caster or healer in the party that wants it, and I couldn't be the kind of person to just take healing gear from a healer.  So I'd seriously look at some key quest rewards that have unusually high Intellect or something.  Leatherworking and Tailoring can also be pretty decent sources while levelling.  Cloth gear is fine.  Now that I think about it, I should go find some guide like that myself, heh.
---
Also, I want to admit that I was rather harsh in my original post here.  I was getting out some angst, sorry.  After spending some time reading things, I've realized that if you cut out the hardcore min/maxing outlier people, Feral Cat isn't nearly as bad as I thought it was even back then in raids, which is very heartening, but unfortunately it is still rather poor.
---
That said, levelling as Feral is fun and great!
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
The bindings are extremely rare. People are being unrealistic when they think they'll just be able to easily get it no problem as soon as they they start raiding. Even at level 100 it took me like a year of consistently running MC to get both bindings.
---
Paladins are group gods, it's why Alliance dominated. Yes, specifically Paladin healers were great healers but it's not simply because of their heals that made Alliance OP, it is their auras, lay on hands, their myriad of blessings, these are things a Ret Paladin can bring too. Ret can also bring a CC if they spec into it. If Rets did anywhere close to Rogue or Warrior damage they would be completely broken, easily the best DPS spec in the game because of all of their utility. 
---
You wouldn't want to stack Rets in your raid but having 1 or 2 is completely viable in a raid. Swapping out 1 Ret for a Fury Warrior is not going to make you kill a boss, 99.999% of the time.
---
we had it goto our main tank, he rage quit at some point, then the next one went to our raid leader, that was all we saw in 1.5 years.
---
Yeah if you stick to PvE it can be a slow build up and be fine. 
---
Just don't expect to jump raids tiers :)
---
War sucks while leveling. Theyre literally the hardest class to lvl. 
---
At 60 they become gods.
---
Your analogy does not work. As in the market we compete for money. In WoW we don't compete for money. So if I eat in a restaurant.. I possibly increase the value of your work and cooking. 
---
If comparing yourself to others is Toxic, Humans are poison. Our moral compass is entrenched in the universal rule; don't do to others, that you don't want them to do to you. 
---
Again you distract from the truth. You are effectively inside the raid for 3 hours. You spend roughly a full time job ammount on prep. 
---
Maybe for you that is what's it all about. For me it is totally different. I think this is fine. I don't disagree. Still I think you are like children and you describe it like I intended. You don't create a challange, you remove the challange. Like I previously said, anyone can do this. Your intire culture is based on removing challanges and distaning yourselfs from competition. Anyone can drive a harley, buy a leather jacket and not wash for several weeks. 
---
You DO support this, by creating a demand for it. Your word's mean little standing by your actions. This will happen 100% and you will take that gold. Blizzard prefers to sell it themselfs.
---
 &gt;why haven’t I learned this before?!
---
Because it's not true.
---
That fear-pathing is how private servers are configured. Vanilla mobs run in a random direction. Always have.
---
Even if that's the case, it only reduces your raid farm time by a marginal amount
---
They're amazing to level if you happen to be a masochist
---
Did you pick up a bad back during that time too?
---
&gt; I will play on a German Server anyways, so no Streamer-Fanboys
---
All hail the mighty EU servers. I'll be playing EU as well and thankfully the only "big" streamers we have don't seem to have an army of spergs following them
---
It doesn't matter, this doesn't happen in the Beta, and it never happened in Vanilla. All private servers are configured in this mode however.
---
So it's not a thing.
---
I've sent this to mine so she knows what kind of lunch notes I expect. top job!

Pirates of the pancreas!!
---
I'm with you brother.
---
Yeah mate, paying for it now.
---
lol, you should play league of legends for a while, you will be thankful for this peaceful community we got here
---
I think the trick some people are missing here are making engineering items people will use to level up engineering.
---
If you make a load of specific parts people will need and post them on the AH im sure you will have success.
---
The welcome bears on the Tirisfal Glades/Western Plaguelands were scary too.
---
No thanks
---
Warriors are just upset because Rets will take their PVP weapons.
---
Of course I'm not Blizzard and I don't see into the future.
---
However I'm pretty confident that a year from now Classic's population will be *not* above current's (not even close). It'll still be very healthy but much lower.
---
Also, the absolute best course for Blizzard, regardless of how popular Classic is (if it is not a complete failure, which I don't think it'll be), is to bring TBC and Wrath servers.
---
Trying to appease Classic players by starting an "alternate" WoW development path is a fool's errand. There are as many opinions as players about what should be in it. Any change risks alienating a large part of the playerbase. It's a lot of work for a very risky result.
---
As opposed to this, creating TBC and Wrath servers is a low effort/risk, high reward option. There are many players who'll play them, guaranteed, just keep them as they were. It's much-much less effort and money.
---
I'd be *very* surprised if Blizzard did anything but this.
---
Looks about right
---
!RemindMe 86 days "git gud"
---
I've played LoL a lot back in day, /r/wowservers and private server people in general are human trash.
---
Optimal, not viable. Ret is a viable spec in end game raids, you just don't want several of them.
---
The wow classic community is overwhelmingly pro Donald.
---
Do you have a video of the tourney ?
---
that would mean the horde are the baddies, and half of /r/classicwow can't have that :^ )
---
Didn’t ask for the leveling phase. Just wanted to know if they are still fun even when you’re not t2/t3 geared.
---
What "drama" does a streamer bring to the average player on a realm? I'm genuinly curious.
---
It seems your issue is you don't like being ganked. This has nothing to do with streamers so the obvious answer would be to roll on a PvE server.
---
Right.
---
Nostalrius was the culmination.
---
What actually brought us here, is the devolving of the game industry in providing a flood of insta-fix, frontloaded, cheap gratification games, completely forgetting that the only reward required for people to play games, ever since cavemen discovered that it's fun to throw and catch sticks, is to PLAY A GAME.
---
People are fed up with this bullshit, this cheap, obvious attention-whoring that WoW retail fell into. We want a real game, something we play because we want to play it, not because shiny-blinky shit pops up on our screen every few minutes.
---
The guy your guild decides. Then he hopes to get the bindings, which your raid group may or may not see one much less both. I have a Rogue who got one binding late in vanilla and was able to complete part of the chain, but need the other one... Have been farming for it since... Seen many people get the whole thing done in a few weeks though.
---
Well since you are part of this community and you are trashing on them, you are just proving your point. Listen to "man in the mirror" from michael jackson
---
I mean there’s more to PvP servers then just ganking, once you’re 60, especially as a streamer, World PvP will be a blast!

About 2-3 hours before my workday was over, I would RDP to my desktop at home to queue up :P. While driving home checking on the phone (of course when standing still at red lights) how far I was. Brilliant.
---
&gt; is to bring TBC and Wrath servers.
---
Which I hope they do. If we could get some kind of half ass confirmation It would appease people knowing that they have something to look forward to. That their favorite class isn't going to be worthless forever.
---
TBC/Wrath were the true high points in WoW for me.
---
So we are in a bigger club!!
---
Well depends on how you see it. You are warrior. You are THE tank not just a tank, so PvE dungeons at 60 will be easy for you to make groups for. For raids you are likely to be a DPS warri, which i think is fine since you can somewhat decently tank all dungeons with a non tank spec. 
---
I could say you should play what you feel like, but you will have a good time as warri at 60, even early on.
---
Cause their smart people.

Because Patchwerk is one of the hardest DPS checks in vanilla and Ret does plenty of damage to beat the DPS check.
---
Probably not because now most people know that engineering is kind of mandatory so most people will have it themselves
---
My friend did this to me in a lan... We were raiding as well and he just fell asleep.
---
Yeah, and so sad for all of us wanting to play warrior as anything but human
---
They could work on this in the background and release a major update to the engine
---
I would love to see a "wow 2"-  not just with improved graphics but a real scale world, it might slow down gameplay but it would be more immersive
---
I suggest 10~15mg of Zolpidem to sleep when you log, you wake up ready for action, 8 hours of guaranteed sleep. I wanted to try some nootropics when waking up to keep focusing on what I'm doing
---
&gt; Hmm I thought this is the reason that retail is boring and people choose classic over it.
---
The #1 reason people want Classic over Retail is that Classic wasn't so linear and hand-holding in what you *needed* to do in-game. In Retail, there's one way to accomplish anything and only one way. In Classic, you figure out what's best on your own.
---
&gt; Having an addon that finds you a group in my opinion will make it easier for people to leave the group in the first problem they encounter.
---
It still doesn't teleport you to the instance. You'll have to interact with people and put effort in. And in the case of the LFG addon we're developing, you can't re-enter the queue until the other members of your first group report the dungeon complete or an estimated time of completion has elapsed.
---
&gt; As of knowledge add-ons can't experience replace them in some way?
---
No, there's just no feasible way to keep all these numbers in your head. We're talking fractions of a second. Thousands of auctions and possible spawn points. It's just impossible.
---
&gt;  Wouldn't the game be harder and more fun without those?
---
Sure, it would be more difficult, but artificially. Without the addons, you're just guessing and in a game full of numbers, guessing isn't very good and to many, not very fun.
---
Excellent!
---
I've been saying this literally for years and yet everytime all I hear is "oh its allways been cartoony" when that is not even the point im making.
---
Glad to see more people seeing it though!
---
I think yes, even with decent mid end gear you can have plenty of fun but people in Naxx gear will literally delete you but that's kind of true for all classes lol. And hey, you can be that Warrior too one day!
---
If you smell coffee, you might be having a stroke.
---
Did they fix combat text too?
---
It looks alot better than the Zelda one. Or I'm remembering it wrong and it looks the same
---
Well we also all had smaller screens
---
tbf orcs are more of a mexican side here
---
I am picking up on that vibe as well.
---
I think maybe it's 14 years of experience with WoW leading people to think "Tanks are \*always\* needed, so I'll be in demand"  and the mechanics for boss fights are less complex in vanilla than now so people are perhaps also thinking that would be the perfect time to get into tanking...
---
...plus of course all those that want to be PvP gods once they are geared and have a pocket healer
---
I considered it briefly myself as an alt, but remembering my time in vanilla and how much time I needed to level and gear up, I think these days I will only have time for a single character.
---
In vanilla I was a Paladin main and Hunter PvP alt..this time around I am torn between mage, warlock or rerolling paladin.
---
Pinging /u/EversorA
---
It does though
---
Omg the true flight paths.. I'm nearly crying.... :')
---
K
---
It's fairly easy really. The "biggest" step in my scenario was automating it.
---
Don't know where you got that idea.
---
While I like looking at these, for ingame I definitely prefer the old graphics, including old models. Anything else would not be Classic.
---
Man, I'd really like this on my wall as well. Let me know if you find a site. I'm from Sweden though.
---
I agree with this statement. I never played retail before and add-ons are a huge reason why. It must be embarrassing for Blizzard to know they created such shitty controls and UI that people have to go out of their way to modify a AAA game created by a billion dollar company.
---
People saying “you don’t need to use them” are delusional. They give you an advantage, so yes you have to use them unless you purposefully want to handicap yourself. They’re extremely accessible, but it’s such an annoyance to have to research which ones are worth your time, and they clutter up the game tremendously, killing a lot of the the enjoyment of actually playing.
---
Now i imagine a tank going faster bc of a carrot on its front.
---
Just right click any of the links to the files  at https://www.classicmaps.xyz/WoW%20maps/ and hit save there.
---
I use the mouse wheel button to auto-move (is that weird?) . So I'm afraid ill accidentally scroll when pressing that but ill try it out.
---
Wait and see for yourself.
---
First, I try to reduce the number of keybinds I actually require. Not every trinket needs a bind, not every gadget is used all the time. For years, I have had my Jeeves in my backpack, never even put it on the Actionbars. Same with, say, Flasks and Elixirs. Macros also help a lot. No use binding naked Stealth to a key, when it's not usable in combat. Therefore, the same button triggers stealth or Vanish, depending on whether I am in combat or not.
---
Now, I like WASD. Tried ESDF, didn't like it.
---
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, E, Q, R, F, Y, X, C, &lt; (german keyboard, grew up with it) within easy reach. My mouse having 2 side buttons and the middle gives me M1, M2, and M3.
---
1,2,3,E,Q,R,F,C,S1,S2,M1,M2,M3 are also used with Alt.
---
That gives me a grand total of 28 keybinds within easy reach, more than enough for any purpose I encountered so far.
---
&gt;Violence is never the answer
---
Hahahahahaha. I have no idea what the context is but that statement is hilarious.
---
I call fake
---
Emerald Dream zone with a raid. Complete original Hyjal and add a raid there.
---
They are waiting on how successful Classic will actually be. The prerelease hype seem to be big enough for them to air their tentative intentions about further development but they don't want to commit themselves until they are reasonably sure Classic doesn't fizzle out.
---
Which I'm sure it won't. :)
---
Yikes. Is that what you actually thought GearScore was for? No one treated it that way. GearScore is to determine the amount of DPS a player can reach, the amount they can heal, they can tank etc. There is no way to measure skill with an addon, but a godly dps in 300gs isn't going to touch a retard in 400gs. It's just math and that is all there is to it. 
---
I understand why it may have came off as people measuring your skill, but you were just salty they turned you down for being undergeared. They knew that no matter how good or bad you were, you weren't going to pull your weight, or as much weight as they saw fit for the group they were making, so they left you out. I'm sorry you are still jaded over that.
---
Now, I don't like GearScore because in order for GearScore to be a thing, itemization has to be designed in a way where it can be calculated. There was never anything wrong with the addons themselves, just the way Blizzard designed loot that made it a thing. This means you will always be using max level gear and following a loot treadmill. I prefer the Classic WoW (or personally, the FFXI style) of loot where an amazing piece can last you for a long time. Some 30 or 40 pieces in WoW may be BiS until max level and some crafted stuff is better than raid tier or even later, and some gear was BiS in FFXI for MULTIPLE expansions.
---
----------
---
I'm sorry that you are incapable of understanding my argument. At no point did I ever say you shouldn't or couldn't invite a ret dps. You can do whatever you want. No one is bothered by what you do, yet ironically, you guys get offended when we make our own groups and refuse to invite you. You are the one acting like a child and it's sad. I'm sorry that some of us just don't want to invite badly designed specs, blame Blizzard for that. If there is an optimal path, players will take it, plain and simple. Now, if you want to switch over to Holy spec, that is a different story and we can talk. Otherwise, make your own groups and stop crying that we don't want to invite you.
---
Female humans also had their casting animations downgraded. Casting a spell with the new model makes you look like a drunken sailor about to go overboard. Awkward swaying to the max.
---
Even without beta im happy that theyre taking it in lvl stages, the 30 cap gave us weeks of great new content explorations that probably wouldnt have seen the day.
---
My only regret is i didnt pay for a subscrition to be consider a beta invite cuz its fucking killing me watching everyone havin fun lol.
---
Far less than there are streamers.
---
Hey, I don't want to get shot for this because, I don't know if mods allow private servers here, but there is a server with duel and PvP in mind just like the tournament you seen Tipsout host recently on classic beta.
---
It's nice if you wanna kill time, get better at a certain class in PvP or not sure what to chose when vanilla launches.
---
to quoate "*1.8 itemized playground to prepare for Classic through dueling, BGs, premades and tournaments.*"
---
I hope they do, probably not going to be done by launch though.
---
Karazhan for sure
---
Nice try, hacker.
---
Yeah definitely. A year after maybe.
---
PvP?
---
You're not t2/t3 when you're leveling...
---
I remember the race remodel in the good old MMO called Dark age of Camelot. however that was clientside so you could play the rework or the old ones. I see no reason why WoW didnt keep both options. Y´know low budget company and all.
---
I want them to be better. Even classic devs admit that paladins were a broken class until TBC.
---
They have an add-on that many install that records the data. That is then uploaded by the volunteers.
---
Yes this is the best part about it. Pretty much a brand new wow experience. Everyone will be starting from ground zero.
---
Nice
---
w00t! I got a beta invi..... ah fuck! It's just another marketing email from Blizzard!
---
I wouldn't call them horrible, but I agree that they do take something away from the WoW aesthetic. The entire video I kept looking at things and thinking "Well shit, is this a render for ants?" because everything looks so damn small. I'm sure Goldshire Inn is bigger than that, but in this render it looks tiny and weird. So I like it, but it needs refinement and it needs to go and reconnect a bit better with that old Classic look for me to love it.
---
Just pm me your account info and I’ll figure out how :)
---
We're both farmers. We till the land, grow our crops, milk our cows, etc. You use your works to feed your family. I'm a little better than you at it, so after my family is fed, I have works leftover, so I sell them to non-farmers. That doesn't diminish the accomplishment of you farming and feeding your family and if you start to feel resentment over my farming, that is toxic. The only time you ever look over into your neighbor's bowl is to make sure they have enough, not whether they have more than you.
---
&gt; You spend roughly a full time job ammount on prep.
---
Nope. We only do full-prep raids once a month and when new content releases. Outside of launches, most of our players aren't in-game for more than 20 hours a week and a lot of that is doing whatever they want, especially PVP.
---
&gt; You don't create a challange, you remove the challange
---
How is wanting to clear MC in under 20 minutes or kill a boss in 20 seconds or clear a raid with 10 people not creating a challenge that doesn't exist in the game?
---
&gt; Like I previously said, anyone can do this.
---
If anyone could, there'd be more that did. This is like saying "anyone can run a marathon". Okay, prove it.
---
&gt; You DO support this, by creating a demand for it.
---
By that argument, putting anything on the Auction House creates a demand for gold sellers. Get real.
---
&gt; This will happen 100% and you will take that gold.
---
If we have any evidence that supports the player bought gold with IRL money, we absolutely will not accept the job. We don't want to get tagged by Blizzard's EULA. Beyond that, it's not our job to stop gold sellers, we'll just have to push Blizzard to do it.
---
&gt;those keybinds that are important in PVP I would recommend being very easy to press, without having to let your fingers go of WAD or something like that
---
Hmm, is that even possible? If you are holding WAD you only have the pinky finger and thumb left. if you use mouse buttons maybe then but I dont know if I'm comfortable with that.
---
Rogues convinced they will get TF?
---
:DDDDDDDD
---
How I get through the week
---
A Legion-based raid, with the end boss being "Hazzikosmonde, Devourer of Dreams"
---
As we banish him back into the Nether, he could cry:  
---
_"Strange...it seems...in the end...you DID want after all..."_
---
Oh, you're right! Even better.
---
The basilisk nearby gave much better drops.
---
I'd like to see a Hyjal raid and zone.
---
Literally now means the opposite of what it use to.
---
I suspected so, do you know of any other project where this data is freely available (for classic that is) - I checked classicDB but it doesn't seem to have coordinate data.
---
This video made me create my undead warrior way back when.
---
As someone that MTs I hate it when DPS arent using threatmeters.
---
Nothing. 
---
They should leave classic as is and just fix retail.
---
attention seeking at its best
---
The new models rly lost the old models in them. These on the pic look so much better and serious. The retail models all look so silly and what annoys me most, they look all the same. The old models have so much facial difference. The retail models somehow look all so extremely the same and hair looks so dumb especially on humans....
---
on the opposite end, i broke up with my first ever "boyfriend" (does a couple days count?) because he wanted to spend time together during my guild's raid time. priorities: sorted
---
Not when it comes to violating the Twitch ToS it doesn't.
---
It doesn't make any difference.
---
Both wear cloth and, by and large, compete for the exact same items.
---
Thottbot.
---
ppl just wanna reap dem fresh karma with old computers on this subreddit
---
Don't forget Shadowform
---
Wow 5 days alone and you might actually be able to do a full BRD run!
---
Just fixed it, should be uploaded any minute.
---
every non german hopes that as well.
---
And what’s difficult about classic again?
---
I did this once when my parents went to South Africa for a month, fucking amazing
---
Happened all the time in vanilla. #Nochanges. /s
---
What's AHK?
---
well 99% od players will tell you to lvl up with swords. You will have easier life with that. I am going dagger because  i don't care about efficient way to lvl. I want to live fantasy my way even if it will be slower and harder experience :)
---
So play as you like!
---
You sure don‘t like rap/hiphop and action movies
---
If you play consistently 15 hours a week from the day classic launches you will not have any problems. Not sure how long it will take but just make sure to get into a decent raiding guild and be there for every raid.
---
Phase 1-3 you will raid one day a week clearing BWL/MC/Onyxia.
---
Phase 4-6 You will most likely do 2, maybe 3 days of raiding (Depending on clear speed and if you do MC/BWL with full raid or with some pugs).
---
Usually your average raid is between 19-23 (18:30 to start getting world buffs). Making it 4 hours/week during Phase 1-3 and 8-12 hours during Phase 4-6. Just keep in mind that you need some way to make gold to get consumables.
---
Pretty sure everyone was removed because they are no longer doing the stress test. From here on out they are just going to do beta. They weren’t even going to run that second stress test but they needed more data. This is just me speculating but I feel like it makes sense to remove it if there aren’t going to be any more stress tests.
---
Blizzard's VP of game design already said [implementing arenas was on of their biggest mistakes](https://www-engadget-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.engadget.com/amp/2009/11/13/blizzard-arenas-were-a-mistake/?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQA#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24sin) WoW's history so why would they repeat it?
---
Sif from Dark Souls1
---
There is a video explaining this on youtube, rock is best with a 2h and wind is best with a fast 1h and a shield. The reason for this is that rock is garantied dmg and has better stats than flame. Wind is rng based so you might not get a proc at all on a mob, or over killed it. Contrary to popular belief, wind is best with a fast 1h and not a 2h because it increases the chance to get a proc. As i said a dude on youtube has a bunch of data regarding this, he is a scientist at profesion so it is a very legit way he has logged the data. I think that kargoz links to his videos on his vanilla shaman guide.
---
this is actually not true
---
Private servers. Huge 4chan/conservative crowd.
---
No one has anytime for that non classic  president garbage in Barrens chat. True classic was Chuck Norris jokes.
---
All I ask is the server to crowded, no problem with a queue to join in. I want people. I WANT SOCIAL. Characters are the most important resource. Lets populate this world. 2005 best game in my life. 14 years pass, ex-addict? No such thing as an ex-addict. I'm addicted just watching these people playing on beta server. I FUCKING WANT TO PLAY WOW CLASSIC. Already decided I can't resist. It's stronger than me, I hope I find people like me on this path. Lets ride boomers like me, lets sacrifice our lives for Hakkar. 2 months to go, a lot of planning and interesting things to catch up. I wanna bring friends to this nostalgic experience with 10x more knowledge when we used to play the game. It has been decided, I love reading your comments, game on fellas. May my excitement of the launch transfer into your souls. Casual lets PLAY, hardcore lets PLAY. It's been more than 10 years I wanted this MMOrpg back. I WANT THIS! I WANT THIS! Next month I will go on my search for people I can relate on my in-game goals, so committed for this
---
I think - IIRC the first stress test was gone from my BNET launcher before I got invited to the 2nd stress test too.
---
So all good
---
For me it is gone now as well - at least you actually see when you get invited to the beta this way. :)
---
Bartender, Bagnon, Grid and clique are the mandatory ones for me as a healer.
---
Why? :D
---
I find them to be awful all together. Walking in a swamp has a so unnatural squash sound. Gladly I someday forgot about it. The old hit sounds were natural, the new ones are just catoony. A rogue makes cling sounds, when a warri hits it squashes as if the whole body is cut in half. If even this makes such a sound. All this is too unreal.. Hate the new sound effects and the worst was the gun sound. I needed that addon that reversed that. But I can't play retail anymore anyway... The game doesn't give me immersion at all anymore.
---
True that is a benefit! Hopefully that happens! People are suspecting a huge beta wave tommorow I heard!
---
Why isn't this in retail?
---
Couldn't agree more
---
You are just not getting it....
---
Cocaine and amphetamines will keep you awake and focused.
---
3-4% DR
---
Haha xD Love that idea! :D
---
That would be super funny and could still work! Maybe not lorewise as an end Boss but it could be a Little rare spawn Boss or something along the lines :P
---
But it defenitely Needs to say &gt; "Strange...it seems...in the end...you DID want after all..."
---
I will... after I ditched my wife and kiddo
---
You’d be surprised how much of a constant dps check vanilla raids are at the start when people are undergeared. Ye sure you can usually be bring a couple rets and you’ll be fine. And then sometimes it’ll cause you to wipe. And their auras will not be useful because you already have enough holy pals to apply all auras to everyone. But I guess a ret can do a lay on hands once per hour. Decent but not worth the luch lower dps.
---
As for pvp. They shine brighter there, for sure. But for serious bg’s, it’s still better to have holy pals and warriors than holy pals and rets. Warriors just offer consistent pressure and healing reduction. Which is usually the most important in premade vs premade.
---
Thanks for such a detailed reply. More than I was hoping for and a lot to think about now!
---
I didn't mention that I have a group of friends who are planning to set up a guild with alot of us filling core roles, recruiting others, etc. These guys raided back in the day and have led 40mans before. So maybe I've got something of a start there. 
---
I might plan around 'maybe' obtaining a T1 set as a stretch goal and go from there :)
---
Thanks!
---
No. Definitely not in my opinion. But dwarfs more than orcs. The orcs look so wobbly now. And their faces are so ugly... Na I just don't like it.
---
In hindsight, I think those numbers were from current retail version
---
Oh well! ;p
---
They're
---
All epic mounts of your faction. Thats alot of runecloth.
---
Yepp, I see no reason to wait 1-2 weeks. Since we get layering and launch day is fkn awesome :)
---
I want to see all the stuff they had planned or ideas for in the first place. Karazhan, Hyjal, Emerald Dream, something in the Caverns of Time or even Ulduar as a continent.
---
Building on the vanilla foundation and taking it into a different direction than TBC. No flying mounts, no arenas, no 25m or 10m raids. Just a little bit more class balance and I'm fine.
---
Dps for sure.
---
 !remindme 75 days
---
nothing is required. any add-ons you use in Classic are just add-ons that make certain things easier to see, but nothing is required to play at an optimal level.
---
It's simply not possible with the addon API, neither in classic nor retail.
---
I just ask myself, what "better" means. I don't like how cartoony all of them evolved. Better is subjective.
---
What are you both talking about ? Of course they had the original client and source code. They even explained every step they went through in a blizzcon panel. Their SCM contains every bit of code since 04/16/1997 and they were very confident that they could quickly build a 1.12 game client as it was back in the day.
---
They had doubts on the original database that they weren't sure they could restore, but they finally found a backup. 
---
All they worked on since then was recreating 1.12 with the current game code to eliminate old exploits and comply with the new authentication and assets system.
---
Watch the panel, it's really informative. I've timestamped it for you at the moment he talks about the original source code. https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=293
---
That would be a pretty tight run, 0 wipes needed.
---
For PvP I would go Orc or Tuaren. 
---
Orc stun resist is good but its hard to rely on it.
---
Tuaren stun is good because you can get off an uninterrupted heal or dmg cast off during the stun.
---
Troll Racial has pretty decent application in both PvP and PvE although maybe not quite as impactful as the others.
---
Completely agree. Retail should be the focus of any new content.
---
you just farm gold in retail and buy 'em off the auction house, but they've heavily inflated in price compared to, like, two years ago, so, it'll take quite a few hours to get enough gold to buy a token, but it's entirely possible to do it.
---
Hi guys, anyone know what ui this guy is using ?
---
24/7
---
Not really.
---
I don't think we have enough tears to handle this one in two games, man...
---
There's 2 more planned. Unless something has changed last couple days
---
What you want is a class that not many people play that is actually good. that way the loot defaults to you and even though you might be under geared if you miss a raid, they still want to have you back because you bring a vital debuff etc. id say prob warlock, even undergeared its worth having 3. maybe 4 for garr
---
I don't know if I support that every player sees something else.
---
probably, but why would they? they know people are gonna pay $15 for Classic, no matter what. Blizzard is still trying to make money, first and foremost.
---
FUCKING
---
THANK
---
YOU
---
Didn't hear about that! Hyped :P
---
My account is from 2006 so I have high hopes :D
---
It is about time for a huge wave though! Isn`t it still only like 2000 People in the Beta?!
---
There is a noticeable uplift in performance (and stability) when compared to the old 1.12.1 client. Compared to retail it runs way faster as everything is way more "low poly". The other problem I found is that Classic client shares the transparency effects implementation with retail which can hard limit performance of some GPUs (low pixel fill rate) if such effect is in the field of view and takes a good part of your field of view.
---
Looks like tukui
---
Remember Decursive? An addon that you could just click a name and mages *still* didn't do it
---
They only did it for performance reasons, not nostalgia.
---
You were only invited to the first round of stress tests. They removed everyone from stress test so people weren’t confused asking why they can’t get into the beta servers.
---
I don't think it's possible without a full reset. One of the main issues is Cata erasing a lot of content and zones being abandoned due to vertical progression (leveling).
---
Leveling is all about sustained and predictable damage.
---
Let's say it takes you 5 extra seconds to stealth, approach, and position. You'll be killing approximately 10,000 to 15,000 mobs on your way to 60. So that's an extra 14 to 21 hours you spend leveling because you needed to stealth.
---
But that's not where you lose the most time. After your Ambush, you're as good as rogue with no talents at all and your DPS tanks. Whatever initial boost you had in the beginning of the fight is now completely lost. You'll take more damage, need to eat and bandage more, it just adds up.
---
A dagger in your Main Hand is only ever a viable option when you can attack from behind 100% of the time. You simply can't do that while leveling alone.
---
With this spec, your Ambush has a 70% crit chance (assuming you're killing a mob every 20 seconds) and an extra 20% damage. That's it.
---
With [the combat spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AAM5OtAA) you'd be:
---
* Getting 10% more Sinister Strikes
---
* Dodging 3% more attacks
---
* Parrying 5% more attacks, which increases your next attack speed too.
---
* Getting a free extra attack with bonus damage and huge incoming damage reduction every time you parry.
---
* Missing with all attacks 4% less often
---
* Sprinting twice as often
---
* Evading twice as often (or at least almost always have it for emergencies)
---
If you wanted to play spriest, then mage would likely be faster to gear in raids.
---
As a holy priest I appreciate you taking your time. My bank balance and nerves thank you.
---
After an X amount of kill on the same player, that player does not give honor to you anymore. Even the HK farm battles will end after 45m/1.5h.
---
Unless the dont come for honor and only for kills.
---
But winning AND losing is a privlage that is not in classic. Everyone is always free to leave whenever they want.
---
EPL/WPL turning into not-plaguelands. Silithid retreating from various zones and/or changing behaviour. More digging and research around uldaman and so forth ;)
---
Spelling is but a minute aspect of overall human intellect, try again.
---
Not the heavy ones, maybe lots of caffeine
---
Zandalar I think
---
Very viable, just slower.
---
Some thing like Cs or ambush opener, gauge at 60 energy, and you will get a bs in before wears off with imp gauge, then mob should be close to dying, so evis or repeat gauge at 60 energy / spamm ss to death.
---
Tried to see if the side strafe aggro backstab works and I couldn't do it. I assumed it was because I was shit at doing it. It actually doesn't work though?
---
I got into the beta today!!!
---
AutoHotKey
---
It’s interesting because back in the days, the most popular servers were PvP. Nowadays there seems to be a lot more people with a “no pvp” mentality. My theory is that younger gamers can’t stand losing/getting killed/are much more entitled to rage than we used to be
---
Looks cool, but as wow graphics goes thats a hard pass from me
---
How much is this worth? This is from the collectors edition from ‘04 right?
---
In it's original form, Decursive was worse than that. You just spammed one button, with your eyes closed, and the macro picked out the player needing a dispel and did it, over and over.
---
Definitely falls in the now-banned EZMode category.
---
with 2 servers i wouldnt be shocked that around 6000 are in
---
Even the thorium brotherhood ones in searing? Think they will Come in a later phase with the recipes?
---
Biggest difference between this sub and the OSRS sub is that people haven't made a single sister joke yet on this thread
---
To avoid germans
---
Having the time.
---
tldr: No, it's not.
---
That doesn’t make it hard
---
No the old casting animation was more aggressive.
---
Could also be Kezan? I think it all moved a bit in later expansions
---
I wasn't talking about a 100 GS difference, people will turn away a former top world progression raider away, speaking from experience, from their PUG group if their ilvl is 5-10 below their arbitrary cutoff, or they don't want more than 2 melee in their 10 man group. 
---
The point is, your argument is garbage. Bringing a Ret Paladin (assuming they are competent) lowers your risk, it doesn't increase it. Hmm, they have off heals, auras, buffs, lay on hands, BOP, bubble, and your conclusion is that it increases the risk in a 5 man group. Are you under some impression that 5 man dungeons have really difficult DPS checks or something? LOL 
---
This is entirely the problem with the average player, hell even a lot of people in guilds that raid 15-20 hours a week fall into these traps of trying to cheese the meters and thinking DPS meters are the most important thing. I liked how in my former guild we eventually made logs private and just said screw it, there's really nothing to be gained in trying to get top parses and they don't prove anything. I've done that plenty of times as a Fury Warrior, consistently in the top 90-95% percentile but you just see too many people that cheese and on progression especially the most important thing you can do is survive as long as possible so that you can learn the mechanics of the entire fight faster.
---
You replied to someone talking about BGs.
---
Maybe you're right, it's just too much :(
---
Warriors are the most gear dependent class in the game. You'll be able to have fun and be viable without ever touching AQ/Naxx; most players will never end up running either of those dungeons. 
---
This subreddit represents a disproportionate amount of the hardcore community. You can play casually as any class and be viable. Pugging ZG/Ony/AQ20 alone would give you enough gear for a decent setup without having to commit to a raid schedule.
---
Don't know if they've decided that yet. There was an interview where the devs got the question about the Thorium Brotherhood camp in Searing Gorge for example that has a bunch of quests for like 47-50. It was currently in the beta but that's was something they considered maybe asking the community about if we wanted it right away or not.
---
Scaling UI ratio: 1!
---
 Damn...
---
Source?
---
Yes.  I did it before and it's really fun.  You need a good dagger though, and also I would suggest a slow offhand you can use for a weapon swap macro.  
---
So your rotation would go Ambush, swap, hemo, hemo, (or repeat till 5) evisc.
---
woooooooooosh
---
Because dwarfs are ugly =(
---
Main tank, as the threat is insane, it was better for rogues pre nerf.
---
We raiding mc every week in vanilla, only ever saw 2 garr bindings, one for Mt, one for my rogue.
---
So good chance alot of guilds will never see one.
---
I am in the same boat. Though I would love to fight against raid bosses designed with the modern mythic mechanics and let the players use the classic wow’s tools and lvl:60 character power.
---
No
---
That helps a lot! Thanks. I don’t wanna go through the whole leveling hell as a warrior and end up rerolling cause I’m not haven fun when I’m not good (aq40/naxx)  geared.
---
Emerald dream, hyjal, uldum, grim batol.
---
&gt; You do good in 5 mans
---
No you don't, sorry.
---
My reaction exactly
---
No they're not.
---
Lol nice going smart boy!!
---
Pffft... I thought you wanted to be hardcore. GL getting first to 60.
---
Why not? Many of us have been leveling through 1-60 atleast 10 times over the years, including in retail vanilla, tbc, wotlk and different private servers. Endgame is where it's at even though the leveling is a nice experience the first few times.
---
Nothing is hard about classic. The game is, as it should be. Yet, some people who never played it are crying about not being able to one-shot every mob the encounter.
---
\*According to the first official news post by Blizzard announcing release dates for Classic launch also included a stress test schedule as show below:
---
* Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23
---
* Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20
---
* Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19
---
It is also noted that these dates are subject to change but as far as I know there has been no official announcement to change or cancel these two upcoming stress tests. Although the reason to why they have removed access for stress test users at this current time is unknown it is likely that it will be enabled again when we get closer to a stress test.   
---
As some have speculated it is also possible that they will include more players into the currently closed friends &amp; family beta effectively turning the main realm into somewhat of a stress test server as well as enabling further testing of the layer systems outside of the starting zones. I wouldn't put my bet on this outcome though and if it against all odds comes true you most likely have the streamers to thank for it.

No, sorry.
---
The earliest version I remember was a little black box that people's names came up in, and you just clicked that
---
!remindme 85 daya
---
Atm when I play classic pservers on 1.12 The performance is shite... I get more fps in BFA and the old client has stutters sometimes if I dont lower the view distance. In BFA I play on max settings and get 200 fps +
---
You are just not getting it...
---
Probably not, no.
---
Never liked this myself, but "trash-talk" is now not allowed?
---
Or you know, things with no gameay impacts. That's a good line. Fuck off with your slippery slope.
---
You exaggerate quite a bit there. I played the first few months of BFA and these days you use a lot less addons in retail than i did back in the days playing classic/tbc/wotlk and so on.
---
The only addons I used were, a bossmod (bigwigs/dbm) which i use since classic.
---
A nameplate addon, and some QOL for whispers and copy paste.
---
I dont need a raidframes addon anymore since the default raidframes are actually really good, i dont need addons to show basic proccs for my class since it's build in now (that said i used weakauras befor, but you only need those if you are really pushing it - I only did heroic raidsraid and, all m+ 15 season 1, so no need)
---
So i can play the game confortable with 2 addons.
---
In classic i am going to have more addons than that, not that it bothers mein - I'm hyped :)
---
Just wanted to point out that you dont need them more than you did back then.
---
Who is complaining about that?  If anything people are saying mobs are easier then they remembered.
---
I'm getting married in June so I have ZERO holidays for the rest of the year :(
---
I can feel a sickness coming on
---
Yes. There's have to be some sort of benefit from crit and antidodge for it to be worth it to go past 308.
---
Have you seen Raziya's hunter guide playlist? He covers a lot of mechanics and mara farm
---
Not to mention restorative potions and other extra items which could break poly and roots. Warlocks become harder to deal with as well.
---
Don't most priests have Power Infusion for that, too?
---
I used to do this in Quake and later Painkiller, I think it's an old man thing
---
When I leveled a rogue in classic, the concern was not the speed. But more efficiency during level and minimize down time. Not dying. In my opinion rogue leveling got easier and smoother from level 30 and onwards. But I had a lot of struggles getting to that point. 
---
I view it as a dance rhythm, you can't keep up with the melody and you fall behind and trip and die, compared to others.. but at level 30 you start getting it, you start to stabilize yourself. While you never catch up again, at least you can dance comfortably on you own. Lvl46+ you are a dance master.
---
You are representing retailgang nicely hah. Just as was expected
---
Expressing your intentions to assault someone if given the opportunity is not trash talk.
---
Add ons have been part of the game since Vanilla, but there was a certain stigma attached to them for a bit. Like players were kind of looked down on, and some thought it was cheating or violated ToS. As many people stated before, the interactions add ons used to have back then has changed, and that will be a difference between vanilla and Classic.
---
I wanted to throw my two cents in. I'm not doing it any more, but I used to Mythic Raid. Got decently far in Legion before life had me reign things in. I keep my add ons to a minimum.
---
There's some folks who will scoff, especially since there are plenty of guilds who do UI checks determine if you're allowed into the guild, but I enjoy the default UI and tend to leave it alone. I staple a DPS meter down at the bottom of the screen just to stroke my ego, I used boss mods to just alert me to specific mechanics, and I used WeakAuras. I did use that for watching cooldowns and monitoring health but to be honest, I was just fine manually watching those things on my own. There were a handful of other add ons for notes and loot council's but generally I kept things simple. I have my important stuff macroed to my mouse( the original Steel Series WoW MMO mouse), and I tend to use the default interface.
---
Vanilla is a lot less friendly than today's. More buttons to press, Procs don't light up action buttons on your screen. I would reccomended some add ons to enhance your skills, but if you ultimately want a minimal experience you can get away with it. If you're aware of your surroundings enough Boss Mods aren't 100% necessary. I would stress, if you only download a single add on, it would be a boss mod though, because the sheer QoL it brings. If you're mindful enough of your buffs, you can tell when Procs are up (I usually notice mine - a lot of Vanilla procs have a unique audio sound, but it's not unreasonable to expect you won't hear that trigger if you're surrounded by 39 other people and a boss). The standard interface is fine - even without a fancy mouse, I reccomended setting up macros for your rotation, your 'oh shit' buttons, etc.
---
I'm very strange. I'm generally not a fan of mods in most games, and I do make a decent chunk of exceptions for WoW, but even still. Ive gotten pretty far in WoW using just a bare minimum amount of add ons. I think you can too. There's no shame in enjoying the original UI.

Uhm.... yo Blizzard would you like to take a look at this real quick please?
---
Rolling greed and solo looting wouldn't bind them. Only rolling need in a group. 
---
So if you find one on your own you can sell it. If a group finds one and no-one needs the winner of the greed roll can sell it. 
---
It means if a good boe drops for a group and some one would actually use it they can roll need without the group thinking they're just going to sell it instead of using it.
---
Preach my man. Say it again.
---
Context.
---
I'm totally lawful good irl so I enjoy the fantasy of being morally questionable here. So I play rogue and warlock. I want to hang out in the creepy back alley or basement of an inn and do some shady shit.
---
RIP chaos bolt, arcane missiles, and chain heal. At least chain lightning escaped.
---
Every time I see old AM used by an NPC or old chain heal from the akunda loa buff proc it makes me a little sad.
---
You should marry your wife again. Get doublemarried.
---
I did a transmog run and both dropped too. Maybe they have a high drop rate when you're level cap
---
Fortnite sucks
---
Bro, can’t you attend uni as a part timer? For a few hours per week at least.
---
I actually wish world buffs did not work in raids/pvp instances. Guess most wont agree tho
---
Archeology.
---
Can you even get lost in Uldaman? Not like the dungeons are hard to navigate for experienced players anymore. Diremaul and maraudon maybe but none of the others.
---
Ye that's correct. The whole set probably 200 euro's/dollars?!

Nope.

"But your honor, I was just kidding"
---
Doesn't matter. Go to jail, do not collect $200.
---
heck yeah. shaman won out. I think it'd be coolest since you played alliance last go around.
---
easily the worst part of playing on a pserver, not being able to see the time without holding over the sun icon
---
I think it's supposed to result in a difference of about 8.5% for white damage. However much that represents compared to yellow damage, eh. It's also worth noting that you free up 3% hit chance you don't need now.
---
Yeah same on my server. But they were from different guilds and now ppl are saying in here that each large guild should have 3-4 ppl... sounds like a pserver thing to me
---
If we are talking vanilla, ive never seen a mage lose to a warrior unless they are really... really bad
---
This is just plain wrong.
---
Sounds super devious.  Sounds like Alliance with the alleyways?
---
This isn't a place for your blog.
---
Of the Whale 
---
Try it. It's great.
---
why the hell would they do that?
---
Tbh I don’t think it will just be private server guilds doing well. Any guild that can clear mythic on live won’t have a hard time.
---
I see Shamans are the masters of fiber.
---
I didnt watch it but why would you think this is remotely possible let alone making videos about the problems it poses??
---
That was quick. 
---
Good work on the maps by the way! Should maybe have said that as well as pointing out the error so I don't sound just negative. ;)
---
Will this get to be an addon?
---
At least you weren't keyboard turning, right? Right??
---
and half a maraudon
---
Oh boy, this is called upgraded graphic. Post it on official forums, maybe blizzard will see and upgrade it before classic launch hah
---
That sounds dope!
---
Quality post

ALSO DAE FORKNIFE BADE

Then the jails would be full and overflowing, and we would be building more jails.

I think the caverns of time got a lot of space for new raids. I am thinking about Wars from the history of Warcraft. 
---
The war for [The Well of Eternit](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0743471199?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wildwenet-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=0743471199)y, for example, was a great book and offers some great raid content.
---
&gt; wait until December 
---
jesus, thats like asking someone to litterally stab themselves :P
---
What's this I keep hearing about not putting points into Sword Spec untill 58, you won't be able to max it out then? What arcane secrets are you people getting at?
---
Oh look someone trying to get views. 
---
Don’t even need to watch a video to tell you that this won’t ever happen. They have stated many times that nothing from retail will go classic and vice versa beside original CE pets.
---
Gnome warrior is probably one of, if not, my top pick too!
---
hey were  you horde there?
---
There are so many Ret posts when it's literally useless.
---
I dont think there's any data to suggest that pvp servers are less popular than before. I imagine it's about the same.
---
I agree!
---
Because they haven't said they wont allow it
---
:'(
---
what do you mean remotely possible? It's easy to do, look at osrs
---
They have.
---
Not even pre cataclysm, I think that's a dwarf shaman? I could be mistaken tho
---
It’s wonderful when everything just comes together.  Those sinfully perfect moments where you just gotta eat that SOB’s corpse.  Is there any other way to live?
---
I don't think you understand the video? It's about gold swapping. So someone will exchange retail gold for classic gold. How they do it in runescape
---
wow chat politics is the worst Ive ever seen
---
so many absolute morons
---
/r/im14andthisispolitics/ material
---
Nice to know.
---
BUT - has anyone actually suspected they were going to do that?
---
I mean... why would they? :D They hired economists for Classic in order to have a proper economy the way it is.
---
Giving the Option to Transfer Gold would totally screw that
---
Warrior (Fury/Prot) &amp; Priest (Holy) looking for a home.
---
We are hoping to find the following:
---
- EU - Alliance - PVP realm
---
- 2 day raid week (pref 1 day in the weekend, but flexible)
---
- Raid times around 19-20 start, 23 finish (server time)
---
- Mature, laid back environment
---
Thanks for your time!
---
more altright than just cons
---
Boar: You came to the wrong neighborhood, bitch.
---
Guard: FOR KHAZ MODAN.
---
I don't mean transfer like that I mean people essentially trade retail gold for classic gold
---
Combat, you start to get  +weapon skill which helps for grinding higher lvl mobs. Also with flurry you get to hit 2 targets every 2 mins. Adrenaline rush combined is a big burst of damage. With evasion and blade flurry you can take down 3-4 mobs depending on gear and level.
---
A secret I found is this quest which is doable at lvl 35. Soloable by a rogue to give you a mace you can respec if you want.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=4511
---
There is nothing they can do to stop that.
---
&gt; WTT 1,000,000 Retail Gold for 10 Classic Gold
---
Yeah, this isn't going to be a problem. People will figure out the max GPH you can make in both games and that will be the exchange rate. Buying tokens in Retail and doing this won't be any cheaper than buying from the oldschool gold farmers and that was never too serious a problem in Vanilla.
---
Rogues should be able to handle the threat with feint and vanish as long as the MT has a thunderfury too. Considering how easy MC will be with 1.12 changes and skill I'm sure many guilds will be later on farming bindings with multiple groups as you don't need even close to 40 for it.
---
where? that's new to me
---
&gt;We want a real game
---
Here we go.
---
I know, but openly allowing it would not be good. So they should atleast take a stance on it. like they do with people buying gold
---
!remindme 90 days
---
Yes I think I understood right. But still - it would be another source of Gold coming into the economy probably making Prices rise hence making People that don't Play retail poorer :3
---
I can't watch your Video right now - I´m probably just saying what you mention in your Video :D I'll watch it later m8 =)
---
malwarebytes blocked it xd
---
Tank will get it, probably few on a server.
---
On Hyjal during Vanilla i remember only 2 persons with it. Never dropped in my raid.
---
People forgot how rare it was
---
Not watching your video due to shameless self-plug but this isn't going to happen much at all. Is it possible? Sure, but why on earth would anyone trade out their Classic gold for retail gold when it's going to be WAY harder to get it on Classic..?
---
Except fucking viscidus

Im here to kick ass and eat bacon

and Im aaaall outta bacon

Best advice for anyone working on cthun is to stay calm. It's easy if you understand and don't get overwhelmed.

I like it, keep the models improve the "square shoulder" texture.

Give them a facelift.

I made a post on this last week and a stupid retard mod deleted and banned me for a week

If you can keep your bags full of shards, Warlock. They'll always take you even if it's just for the stones and summons.
---
Thing is you aren’t violating any TOS by doing that. By buying gold from a third party site you are violating TOS and blizzard has made there stance clear on that. They don’t care what you do with your gold in game as long as there is no RMT involved.
---
Eh you may as well do ouro on the way it's only a 3min detour I'd you don't fuck about.
---
I booked a week off work 1 week after the game drops, I'm thinking I can get level 20-25 in the first week just playing after work, then in the 2nd week most people will be back in work/have quit the game.
---
Gotta play smart
---
I know people are rabid about the no changes movement, but I really think a clock is one of those tools that should be added anyways. It's just going to end up being some addon someone else has to create, and then there's the chance it'll get bugged or fuck something else up. Hell, they could even add it as a toggle under settings. I'd just prefer the option for it to be available.
---
WHY IS EVERYBODY AT FARM?!
---
On the alliance side... We have 3 bases but every game shitters will still leave them and go farm, thanks for reminding and triggering me
---
Dude. I fucking LOVED Winterspring. I love snow zones so much.
---
They absolutely will not allow you to do this.
---
What an absolute waste of a video.
---
Damn horde. Sadly i think I’m getting won over. Always played alliance for no real reason. Shaman always kept me away because of totems but I’m sure I can figure out keybindings with a naga. Started one earlier today on a pserver and already enjoying it.
---
Im simply saying that if we had WC3 reforged now then it would of been alot better for the hype than seeing all these lvl 30 meta video's everywhere and also that way people could all enjoy it, plus less people would probably play it now it's out after classic wow
---
To pay for a sub.
---
Anal [Lightning Shield] 
---
Tbh that might not have been classic, maybe it was TBC
---
Keep her forever. 
---
And get her addicted to WoW.
---
Gotta get your priorities straight. 
---
You can get married in Stormwind; kill two birds with one stone.
---
They aren't anyway, waste of a video LOL
---
It will happen.
---
Considering you take twice as many warriors as other classes I wouldn't worry too much. I think once bad hits there will be a lack if warriors.
---
Because every other subject has been beaten to death by now.
---
Yeah outside of streamers I don't see the big deal. Seems like a good toggle option. Kind of nice sometimes.
---
Hard when you go on youtube and literally see it everywhere haha
---
Hi, /u/mtjoker
---
Yeah this looks good I'd use it.
---
Just ask a city guard, you will learn it eventually
---
Tbh i would like to see the hellfire peninsula zone that was planned in vanilla, along with a version of black temple within that zone. I always thought it was odd that BT was moved from hellfire peninsula to shadowmoon valley. 
---
The same is the case with icecrown glaicier and the lich king.
---
Along with the addon, they have access to the information from allakhazam and thottbot.
---
So they might have used that information to fill in the gaps while the addon gets populated.
---
There’s nothing they can do to stop it.
---
True, sadly my vacation just ends the week before release, but have vacation when the name reservation thingy goes live so i got that going for me at least :¨)
---
Spriest is lowest priority cloth loot in raid if you’re with a guild. If it’s pugs and just rolling on stuff then the same. But a healing priest would have high priority.
---
Next video idea, why would transfering lvl 150 characters to the classic realm might not be a good idea
---
If your not a streamer then dont burn yourself out, only people the streamers are playing beta is because it's there job
---
Check. Your. Client.
---
Every.
---
Day.
---
(Just in case)
---
No it won't. Lol.
---
only required addon for raiding is a threat meter.
---
The city trainers are handy sure. But there are certain things that don't show up on the guards like Reagents vendor, Ammo vendor, mailboxes. Stuff like that that may not be something that you find or remember in all the towns.
---
You really don’t think people will be trading gold in retail for gold in classic?
---
Mining can make you gold by selling stacks of ores. And if you're gonna be an engineer, I assume you'd be a miner.
---
I am pretty stoked. I still cant decide on warlock or druid because I played both heavily in vanilla. But I never really touched professions until like, WotLK. Was too grindy too young me. But boy oh boy once I did I loved it. I will max out engineering and mining at every chance. I want that death ray in low level BGs!
---
Is it now possible to filter by stats in green text, such as shadow damage?
---
I'm getting No realms available. I stuck with it on both waves constantly relogging/trying to get in during the test hours. Also made it to 5 and 10 with \~16 hours playtime on my characters.
---
Only the quests available at the launch of vanilla will be up. Certain quests like 0.5 gear quest lines, AQ quests etc will be gated.
---
pffft i'd rather join &lt;Redridge Neighbourhood Watch&gt; !
---
Vanilla WoW is a wonderful place.
---
imagine feeling superior cause u play on a pvp server ^^ in the end its a pve game and 90% of world pvp is ganking from higher lvl player or more from enemy faction, it kinda make it more anyoing but not really harder, that sayed cause i allways played on pvp it just would feel wrong and pve wouldnt give me that open world hord vs alli feeling
---
This comment will deffinetly show you in good light tho.
---
I think people don't understand this. It's swapping gold between the two games. So trading retail gold for classic gold. I don't get why you guys are getting so heated over this...? It's a simple post to promote discussion.....
---
Warrior tanks always gets TF first.
---
It's a no brainer.
---
Luckily, the graphics were never the point why WoW was THAT successful, but damn... This I would call the very special icing on the cake! Where can I throw my money at?
---
"John Locke from LOST" jesus.
---
Wtf are steggies
---
Good to know, I guess there is no way to get this data otherwise?
---
Resist are calculated with hit cap or is that just a thing with wording on this specific talent?
---
this should be higher, i remember taking week off TBC came out, omg a shit show lol, took you AGES to just level through hellfire pen.
---
I honestly doubt you will see it happen. In terms of DPS the Warrior is still the best pick since him having the Thunderfury means more DPS for the whole raid (since aggro is less of an issue). Unless a guild has very very un-reliable tanks, I don't see the Rogue being the first, or even the second player to get it in the guild.
---
The raids will manage smaller setups for sure, but we're still looking at a ~3% droprate per week. Good luck is all I'd say. I've done MC every week for about a year in 'modern' and only have 3 bindings and they are all the same one. Never saw it drop when I played Vanilla or TBC in its entirety.
---
Classic they run in random directions.
---
On private servers they run away wrong.
---
Me too, man! I am most worried about free time, because I know I don't have the self control to stop playing and I'll end up ruining my sleep schedule and will have to go to work feeling like shit for weeks ;D
---
It's funny how theres people who hate any kind of deviation from how WoW vanilla was. But the game had so many flaws that needed some QoL changes. And now that we get them, it's not changing the game for the worse. It's just fixing it up a bit to make it as awesome as it can be without losing what it once was
---
Can someone explain why so many people seemingly want to be in a beta of a game that is over 10 years old and gets wiped afterwards anyways?
---
Seems like quite the waste of time.
---
Swords all the way.
---
Blade flurry wreaks.
---
Yeah, you will have to go through various death marches but that’s what it’s all about!
---
This is good, I was thinking warlock.
---
You get WF at 30
---
Lol what? You can't pay for the sub with Classic gold, they already confirmed that. It's also going to be immensely easier to farm for a sub in retail.
---
I've decided to play some games from my youth.
---
Installed Might &amp; Magic 6. 
---
Damn, it is such a good RPG. Hardly convinced myself to go to sleep yesterday.
---
Same, mine is gone as well!

FATALITY! Man you really totally destroyed that straw-man!
---
Think of a clock with a second hand ticking (server ticks). Everything ability casted will hit when the hand ticks. If you and an enemy mob both use an ability in between the ticks, it will get applied when the next tick happens.
---
Да, у зверей можно посмотреть броню. Но там много других типом
---
&gt; By the way that's for bug reports purpose and won't be there in live classic.
---
Did you even read what I wrote?
---
&gt; and should be kept in
---
Also, I won't fuck off with my slippery slope. Blizzard is known for going too far with changes. You say 'no gameplay impacts' but that is vague and naive. What is across the line for some is fine for others. No changes ensures it is Classic for everyone.
---
I accidentaly hit him while being level 5 on the stress test the other day...
---
He fucked me up !
---
did they raise the lvl cap ? nice!!!
---
Yes and no.
---
From level 55, you want to be running BRD, Scholo, Strat, DM, LBRS and UBRS. Saving what ever you get, as some pre raid BiS is not always level 60 gear.
---
You want to start saving resistance gear from the mid 40s. Fire, frost and nature mainly.
---
Who's going to farm gold in Classic to trade to retail when farming in retail is immensely easier and the sub is the same..?
---
Noooo.... Is that somehow not a thing in retail?...
---
Who said anything about paying with classic gold? Classic gold will have more value. If people don’t plan on playing retail at all to farm for it then it would be easier to trade classic gold for retail gold to pay for a sub.
---
TIL Dustwallow Marsh looks like a dragon.
---
I am not sure if such a map exists, however I was able to find [this](http://wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp?ID=42) with a quick search.  It lists all the quests in SW as well as NPC names and what they do/sell
---
That's cool, but I was literally referencing a famous tv show that most people know about as that was way more likely to be what something knows about over a historical figure.
---
i never use addons. they are all sofa king ugly. even recount clashes hideously with the ui. im just spoiled. blizz ui has always been so good in every game theyve made.
---
Vanilla players were all dicks, just like today.
---
The main difference is back then people would use words that are banned now through either PC culture or censorship.
---
if you're trying to troll barrens chat, it would be better to say obama &gt; trump.
---
nobody in the barrens is going to disagree with trump &gt; obama.
---
There's some korean mmmo's with extremely good world design, like blade and soul's vertical diving and jumping around the zone for example... But then they get ruined by the 100 other issues with korean mmos
---
Even if they dont allow. I just go to China People. Blizzard don't give a fuck at all. That is how the really works. People still think, people Ban for buying Gold or other stuff.
---
Can't really speak for a shaman but this video was a pretty good indicator of a well played druid at 60 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB1Q4MbqyGI
---
Classic was never designed for PvP.
---
Arenas would just ruined the game.
---
Memories, and to flex about being in the beta.
---
&gt; then it would be easier 
---
No, it wouldn't. Some people might do that if they absolutely cannot stand playing retail just to farm gold, or they're too stupid to work out that it's easier in retail, I guess. There are many, many people right now farming retail gold so that they don't have to pay for a Classic sub for like 2 years.
---
I will depend on the exchange rate ;-)
---
The true fun starts in August so most of us are not really worried
---
wish there was an addon for that so i could do my own thing and just let it entertain people
---
Do we know how talents interact with ignoring the first 1% hit?  For example, a tauren shaman has a base 8% chance to miss, but has taken talents to gain 3% hit; does he now have a 5% chance to hit or a 6% chance (ie is the first 1% *from any source* ignored)?  And is the first 1% from gear still ignored if starring from a higher base chance due to talents?
---
Normally the data is acquired by the wowhead addon. But since classic is unique, they are using old data from the old sites to fill in the gaps until the addon can confirm.
---
If all else fails, try using classicdb. It's a good site.
---
&gt; I don't see the Rogue being the first, or even the second player to get it in the guild.
---
Didn't say they would. It should absolutely go to MT first and probably the second one to OT too.
---
Obviously it's a luck of draw thing. We got 3 Thunderfuries back in vanilla. I grinded my TF back in Wotlk and got one for few of my pals when they tagged along. I fully expect more hc raids to farm MC with 3-5 teams once MC is otherwise "outdated" in small/alt teams.
---
The majority of your posting has been orientated around pointing out how much more difficult modern is compared to classic, so forgive me for believing that this is your primary reason for believing that its so superior.
---
I recognise that classic is a bit too easy nowadays, which in many ways is a negative, you fail to acknowledge a single positive about classic or a single negative about modern.
---
That doesn't sound like you are projecting fair view points, it more sounds like you've just come here to shit on classic, and use words like like 'subjective' to make it sound like you're not being biased.
---
Pot calling kettle black imo.
---
i am sure this is in retail too
---
Of course they can.
---
It's just gold selling/trading.
---
You just wait for a players gold to spike and then you ban the account.
---
I'd suspect it's all sources of hit chance.
---
I'm sure I bought it back in the days, but I guess something went wrong...
---
 siphon life and life leech  both do NOT get reduced by mortal strike until [ patch 2.3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0)
---
And berserkers rage only lasts 10s while fights at that level generally take longer. So just use it early and then wait 15 seconds ( or use a diminished fear if you *have* to). Or dont. You do not really need fear in a 1vs1.
---
Dont forget that the shadowweave  "set" also becomes available. ( theoretically also 2x the epic ring,but that is not really realistic to have) 
---
Getting rolled as a warlock between 36 and 42 is REALLY unlikely. Between sacrifice, health stone, soulstone , spellstone vs casters and drain life you have at least twice as much health as every other class at that level.
---
If you dont get max range kited or killed in a stunlock ( less likely as orc masterrace) you are a walking god at the levels ~36-42.
---
Lets have a short run down of the level 40 ranks:
---
* health stone : 500 life ( 250 with ms)
---
* sacrifice: 1095 (unskilled)
---
* soul stone: 1100 life
---
* spell stone: 400 magic damage
---
* drain life : 41 per second + spell dmg scaling
---
 the warrior has to chew through ~2450 life  just from abilities.  Plus the warlocks life+ the amount he drains. 
---
I am sorry, but if a warlock really gets rolled over by a warrior it is the warlocks fault, not the warriors feat.
---
Some people might prefer retail. Or wish to have more gold in retail. (vice versa). There will always be a demand.
---
First of all, happy cake day. 
---
As far as I know the last invites were sent out a couple of days ago to Friends and Family, but in order to see if you got in, you have to open your battle net launcher and under WoW there will be a new entry that says Beta. Also you may or may not receive an e-mail. The launcher is the sure way to see if you got in.
---
Nah, none unfortunately
---
I’m sure there will be people who do it. Just cause it easier doesn’t mean people want to play it. There’s plenty of people coming back to the game that haven’t played in a few expansions and don’t have toons at max level. How do you expect them to farm 120k a month on US or 200k on EU without that.
---
My friends are trying to arrange a holiday for the end of August/start of September. It's the first test to see how neckbeard I will become
---
How do I download a section of the map on gigapan for printing purposes?
---
The only slim way Engineering will make you money is if most people go gnomish and you go goblin and sell the superior bombs on the AH.
---
It will mostly be a money sink though.
---
True, anything unmoderated swings to the right eventually.
---
close, but no cigar
---
There’s nothing in the TOS that says you can’t.  So they can’t ban you for that lol.
---
GODS I WAS HAPPY BACK THEN
---
Yeah, your version also still has "Ahn'Quiraj" so it's an older one. (the browsable map atleast)
---
Playing an ARPG for 20-30 minutes seems counterintuitive.
---
 Stegosaurus
---
You're a good man, MrBobSquatalina.
---
That's just crazy to me.
---
Almost the entire game are blood elves, humans and night elves.
---
i'll bet all my gold they wont allow it. 
---
If they do they ruin the vanilla experience lol
---
Which section do you want? You can better download the raw versions from the repository link.
---
add nsfw tags you monster
---
I’m the guy that never played WoW at all, and now since they’re going back to what people really got excited about in 04’ I wanna see what the hype is all about. I don’t want to miss out on the event again now that I can afford the sub fee (which I’m also really against).
---
The add-ons are a joke to me. I watch pvp videos, and I’m a pvp player in all the other MMOs I’ve played. They all have like custom frames, bars, timers, cues and procs for skills because the animations are so weak. Instead of playing a game like blade and soul where you can actually read what your opponent is doing, you’re stuck looking at bars and words that flash up on your screen because of 3rd party software. 
---
Like I said, I’m not the nostalgic one, but I’m coming to find out why people love this game so much. 
---
That being said, I love Ragnarok Online, so I understand how powerful a good community is in the enjoyment of a game. But I really think the design of this game is nothing to praise in comparison to a lot of other MMOs.
---
I’m currently playing on Light’s Hope in preparation for launch because I have no idea how to play this game, and I don’t want to be too far behind the curve. I don’t have any add-ons installed, and the UI is pretty abhorrent as is.
---
Exactly. It’s basic marketing strategy, get streamers into your game early on before its release, inevitably you will have more players on release. All the angry nerds who hate women coming out of the woodwork tho, community has not changed one bit. You can hide behind it being that she’s knew, anyone with half a brain can see its cos she’s a streamer. Just want a reason to hate on a girl. Man it’s going to be full blown aids on release, can’t wait for the shit show.
---
You should try Grim Dawn. While not that rich with theorycrafting as PoE it still has a room to create something unique and you can play a piano build or one-button-spam build  or focus on two-three nukes.
---
please tell me they didn't change the flight paths? i do remember there was long flights?
---
You can make some money from certain things. Early game you can for instance make Deadly Blunderbuss for the ashenvale quest line that gives some nice blue items. That's an easy 20s profit per gun which is huge for being something that you can do at lvl 20ish. 
---
At later levels you can take your chances and make Green Lens. If you get lucky and get any of the "of frozen wrath", "of shadow wrath" or "of healing" you can make a good 20-100+ gold of profit depending on the economy and the stage of the game.
---
Certainly a failed opportunity that they didn't go for the remaster route. That would have certainly appealed to quite a lot of people who aren't only in for the nostalgia or unrealistic expectations.
---
Stun locks allow it to happen, but you have to rely on your cooldowns and openers each mob
---
Never said they were, you half wit.
---
That's the plan, but the projects for sure I will fail all of them
---
It removes the need for communication. Felt more like retail where you just join up with a group, finish your quest and leave without saying a word.
---
Only 83 days left!
---
Heal MC, BWL while collecting T1-T2 and 1 good 2h. Doable as it usually goes to offspec so no warrior prio on it. Also the set is mostly subpar for healing compared to some cloth pieces
---
After, respec and enjoy your fun pvp experience till Nax farmed premades and HW/GMs appear and kick everyone asses.
---
Remember in AV chat everyone was screaming "WOW = Waiting on Warhammer" "This game sucks, Warhammer will kill it!"
---
Cheers, and yes the old version is uploaded at Gigapan. The 'New' folder in the repository link contains the updated ones, which are now old again :p.
---
If Blizzard would give me the option to work on that haha.
---
Oh 100%, some of the biggest dicks I've ever met are alliance, but it seems horde have slightly more common, yet smaller dicks. Lol.
---
Root cause of a wipe - do we get an RCA after and will we be having weekly sprint plannings for loot distribution?
---
Better not go there and start all those arbeit mach frei jokes inraid
---
It is quite obvious how dated the models, textures and shaders are.
---
Haha give me your home adress i can help you
---
I take your gold. Its not against the ToS so it probably will be allowed. Multiboxing also ruins my vanilla experience and is essentially cheating but since its not agains the ToS and Blizzard even makes money thanks to it, it is allowed.
---
does it say classic in the client? or just ptr?
---
Chuck Norris ~~jokes~~ facts.
---
you're so right tbh. a lot of the new models had the personality of their running animations removed in favor of ''let's see how bouncy and energetic we can make this for flexing'' but not female humans when they probably really needed it..
---
What kind of argument is this? Shouldn't it apply to any battleground as well?
---
Looks cool
---
Still, getting raided is a bit surreal and I find it's a violation of your privacy unless you were distributing files en masse like you owned a piracy server or something. I find it a bit shocking to be honest.
---
&gt;search all our computers for more
---
I would have encrypted all my shit just to fuck with them. Do they knock and search your shit with your supervision or do they just bust down your door and do whatever they want to your stuff? What if they damage said stuff?
---
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, but that was my tldr of the video :P
---
Damn right.
---
Your timezone and/or usual raiding time might be helpful.
---
Its not for real money so im pretty sure they will allow it.
---
Haha i fucking hate the autistic nochange mongoloids. I read a comment by one who wanted to keep bugs in to have a more authentic feel... lmao
---
LETS FUCKING GO !!!! 😂
---
It's not always about the fastest route though.  There are still some quests that I never did in vanilla because I always chose the optimal route.  I intend on enjoying it more this time.
---
The hype was real.
---
may or may not have put a little bit too much time in this one.
---
regardless - super hyped to spend this autumn with the boys, grinding, gearing bickering in voice chat. the hype is real.
---
Altough its not that easy. All of them stack quite closely dmg wise.
---
You want high consistency but you are not in a dungeon? Rockbiter.
---
RNG cloth eater? Windfury.
---
High armor targets ? Better not use those two.
---
I hope they focus on more important things.
---
It wasnt just clicking a name, if it was it would be fine. Thats how people heal anyway
---
This is sooo insufferable lmao - If sodas guild struggles cos a druid is missing, then being ganked might actually be the least of his worries T.T
---
Theres flypaths that were ingame in 1.12. Like you have camp taujaro, ungro crater and silithus. Those werent there at launch, but was added later. Those are in. But the flying speed seems to be \~same, so you can "enjoy" flying from Tanaris to Winterspring or Darnassus to Feralas and both of those will take a loooong ass time.
---
You mean the most bullshit raid encounter in Classic?
---
Well, only one can be the first of course. But whoever bangs the gong within 11 hours or so after the first also gets the mount.
---
I need to make a new release due to a typo in the map so wait for that at least!
---
no ive heard its fixxed, and that a good thing, in vanilla they where very short like 20-30y before you saw them
---
Weird as there was no Btag in vanilla
---
Trump&gt;Hillary. It’s been proven.
---
I think you mean on a somewhat acceptable level. You know what optimal means, right? You 100%need addons to play at an optimal level.
---
Thank you I was really confused
---
I looked at classicCB, but i'm more interested in the co-ordinate data, but appears thats only available from wowhead and I don't feel like scraping their data base.
---
&gt; get wrecked by the most OP comp, and then complain about the imbalance.
---
Can't you say the same about meme specs in PvE that do no dmg and nobody wants to raid with? Or specs that are less favored in BG's and nobody wants in their premade?
---
Everyone starting with Classic will not know how good their class/spec is at every point in the game. Especially with the gated content releases.
---
Hmmm... but you didn´t accidentally throw away the Classic CE because you had a brainfart? :D
---
I mean - as Long as you used the code it's okay - but still sad :P
---
aLt RiGhT
---
!remindme 81 days
---
Yeah that seems to be the case, maybe for the better.
---
Every server will have a guild "me and the boys"
---
God, my job flies until after lunch. 3 hours to go when I get back, and that shit lasts a lifetime
---
BRD, Zul'Farrak, Scholo, Strat, VC
---
Look like changes made
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwx2jv/flight\_paths\_currently\_banking\_and\_more\_action/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwx2jv/flight_paths_currently_banking_and_more_action/)
---
You are contradicting yourself in the title. If you wanna get to 60 as fast as possible you should have no professions while leveling except for first aid.
---
The new models look better. Not sure how you could reasonably debate that apart from pulling a conspiracy theory.   
---
The new models would feel displaced in Classic. So its good they didnt try to force them upon Classic.
---
Ok, so lets say they do. So what?
---
How will it affect your gaming experience?
---
[Ew, gross.](https://youtu.be/MKjDylyVNVg?t=41)
---
Why wouldn't you? People enjoy different things.
---
Haapy cake day amigo! Hope you get the beta invite
---
there is that line for me, no bottle pissing, I will take showers and take care higiene I do love to level speedrun. Keep me updated if you try the heavy ones share the progression/efficiency/time
---
[Level 20](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AAM5MEAA).
---
[Level 30](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AAQ5P3AEAA).
---
From there you have 2 options, Dual Wield Spec or Sword Spec.
---
Dual Wield spec you can depend on regardless of weapon type. It's sustained DPS, so there's no lost burst at the end of a mob's hp bar. Pick up a MH mace that's got much better top end damage? Too bad, you're sword spec for the next 25 levels. Pick up a fast dagger for your OH? Too bad, you're sword spec for the next 25 levels.
---
So you choose Dual Wield.
---
Now you have a choice between Sword Spec, Aggression, or Weapon Expertise.
---
Aggression is the obvious choice. Only 2 more points until AR!
---
So where do you put that last point? In +3 skill with three weapon types you might use or a 1% chance at burst damage? The +3 skill is huge every time you level up and every time you're fighting a mob even 1 level higher. It's dependable DPS.
---
So you [ding 40](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AAU5P3DEHQA) and finally have AR. Only 20 levels to go.
---
Now your choice is Sword Spec or Malice. 1% chance to hit twice (which can apply poisons but can also be missed, dodged, or parried, or blocked) isn't as good as a straight 1% chance to crit. Plus, you don't know what weapons you'll be using for the next 20 levels, something good that isn't a sword might drop! So you take Malice.
---
Sword Spec, Improved SND, Murder, or Ruthlessness?
---
Ruthlessness is meh because your mobs will die with combo points on them. Murder is good, that's damage you can depend on against almost all mobs you're leveling against. But that improved SND is great. You've already been trying to keep it up 100% of the time but now it lasts for ~18 seconds off of one cheap shot and a whopping 30 seconds at full points, so if your mob is almost dead, you don't save a couple seconds with Evis, you just refresh SND and have it up for the entire next fight already.
---
Murder or Sword Spec is a toss up at face value, but taking Sword Spec doesn't unlock anything further. Murder does. So we take Murder.
---
Now, we're [level 50](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AgzwBTk_cMQdAA). We want that Relentless Strikes! It effectively reduces the cost of Evis/SND and all our other finishers by 5 energy.
---
Lethality is the obvious choice next. In the early levels, we didn't have much agility or crit chance on our gear, but now it's a huge boost.
---
So you're [level 57](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/Awz0wAU5P3DEHQA). Maybe now it's time for Sword Spec? Well sure, if you're using swords right now. But even if you are, does a 1% chance at hitting twice really sound better than another +3 skill when you know you're fighting mobs higher level than you? That +5 skill is a magic number, now you have +3% hit on a level 60 mob and your glancing blows are doing 20% more damage.
---
Level 58 and 59. Yeah, might as well put them in Sword Spec if you know you'll be taking swords to 60. Not much else to do with them. You'll be [respeccing at 60](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/Aw_0wAXwfMMc9AA) tomorrow anyways.
---
Damn 3 TFs, I never saw a single one in Vanilla. Good stuff man, hope you can get one again.
---
Oh darn ... Ive been playing for 2 days!
---
Writing "inv [pls]" in chat is so much better.
---
For real.  All of these retail plebs are coming in and trying to muck things up.
---
I'm playing one a private server now. I don't understand how you could pick anything else for a horde warrior.
---
(X) Doubt
---
The fix doesn't work, I'm guessing that variable gets updated again back to 0 in one of those load functions between lines 22 and 65? If I manually set it back just before line 65 it no longer crashes, however it's not accurate to my current weapon.
---
I also note in the Hunter class/file you manually set the range speed, is there no way to dynamically set that based on weapon speed? The current timer is not matching my attack (though that may just be a visual bug?).
---
I see you said you don't have beta access - I'm happy to test and help troubleshoot anything for you; I'm a programmer by trade but have never worked on WoW addons. Let me know :)
---
These would literally deepfry your computer, they’re not meant to be played
---
Outside of of the hardcore raiders who know these fights in and out, wouldn't it make sense to gear the main tank as much as possible to help push progression? Like imagine I make a guild, and I have maybe 10 good members, and 30 noobish to average playees. We have enough people who know what they're doing we have a clear plan, but we kinda suck at executing said plan as a whole. We're wiping on the some random boss of the raid. Chances are gearing either the main tank or the off tank (depending on how/when we're wiping) would grant more % towards raid survival than gearing any other player right?
---
good to know. Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Questing in the barrens is where you made your first mistake.
---
Will do! Thanks for the heads up. Also, great work!!!
---
They look like shit.  [What even is this?](https://youtu.be/MKjDylyVNVg?t=41)
---
People often forget that the flight paths were a big part of the marketing in the beginning. Flying through this beautiful 3D world was mind boggling back in 2003 and this was a major feature noted in even reviews of the game.
---
Funny how technical milestones become a chore to many so quickly. I’m excited to ride these rollercoasters personally.
---
No, just pay your sub.
---
Fire destro was a very popular spec in TBC before all the +shadow damage gear in T5 what are you talking about
---
But then the game wouldn't be a historical recreation of Vanilla which is blizzard's teams ambition.
---
How would they know you're a guy?
---
Yeah, there will be people for sure. I just don't think the number is anything worth thinking about at all. People aren't going to be able to reliably farm much Classic gold for a while, especially with the surge of players, and with DM not out until 2020, and Mara runs currently aren't viable with the way instances don't reset, etc. By that point BFA will likely be way cheaper and it'll *still* be easier to buy BFA, level to 120 in a day and farm. Just my take.
---
We are playing on EU and no dailies or spring planning, please ;)
---
Loot distribution and raiding times will be discussed and changed accordingly. Most likely we will go with loot council (maybe DKP?) and raiding 2-3 days in a week (exact days to be discussed).
---
That's reassuring to hear. I'm a filthy casual now playing solitaire and minesweeper, no hours of grinding for me.
---
Nobody that prefers retail is going to farm gold in Classic to trade to retail. That's absolutely bananas.
---
Yeah, like when they made a big deal about upholding the style when they were first redoing the models in WoD?
---
This makes me sure the old models only made sense in their own context and that's why they're so great.
---
You seem to think that getting tier 3 is a grind and somwhat related to how much you play when it really isnt. Log on to raid twice a week and you're fine. Just find the time to prepare yourself for those raids and you're good.
---
he didn't even report them, or make any sort of remark about getting them banned. grow the fuck up dude.
---
It's just a shame that your site is adware filled,Malware ridden piece of shit that probably has so many viruses that it would make Paris Hilton green with envy.
---
I am happy about that.
---
Im permabanned from his channel, I still have no idea why
---
Thats good, was abit scared it would be in since it would heavily affect pvp both world pvp LoS hiding and WSG flag
---
Some are better than others.  Most are mediocre at best.  Some look like crap.  Completely unnecessary in Classic, though, because Classic already looks _exactly_ how it should.  Point blank.
---
Lol got about 3 of them in my cupboard.
---
Never said it would.
---
The game has always been on the “funner” cutesy side of RPGs. 
---
It's cool that you're more on the *serious* side of design, but that's ultimately subjective. I also notice you're using *Disney* as some sort of pejorative. Replace that word with *Pixar* and see if your argument still stands. 
---
What *is* true is that lower rez graphics are more abstract and that can affect immersion—for better or for worse. This can be good or bad depending on how you feel immersion should work.
---
For example, I felt more connection to the sprites in FF6 and their limited emoting than the latest uncanny-valley-riddled designs of recent FF games.
---
That being said, be careful not to fall into the same trap as the stupid, anti-Pandaren crowd. Mists of Pandaria had some of the most touching, emotional, violent, dark narratives in the game. At no point did the Pandaren's “cartoony” design undermine that.
---
Like I said, replace your insult—Disney—with Pixar and then see how many people will agree with you.
---
I'm probably the only one who doesn't want to play beta. I watch the occasional stream or two and it satisfies me. I'm OK with waiting 2+ months. Than my life goes to the shitter again
---
I believe the touched on this in the blizzcon panel back in 2018 but the thorium brotherhood quests were partly implemented so that players would have more quests to do in the 50 - 60 bracket. So yes, I believe it will be out at launch, mb not the rewards but I think most of it.
---
I updated the post with additional information.
---
I went onto retail on my OG 2005 account and typed in trade "this game will die on 8.27.19" 
---
Never seen a dead trade chat get more argumentative so quickly lmfao
---
Trolling chat will never get old
---
We got bamboozled hard on that game XD
---
Again, people that play both games will swap around. Lets say there is an expansion release for retail and that player wants more retail gold?
---
I had a buddy with anger issues in high school during my WoW years, one time his hot pocket was too hot on the outside, almost burnt him but still cold on the inside... we were playing WoW and he was so pissed about it he threw that shit against the wall full fucking speed.
---
If they add ANYTHING to classic I hope they finish up that questline that starts with Essence of Eranikus(?), from the last boss of sunken temple. Iirc it currently ends in you talking to some NPC in winterspring leaving you with no reward or real end to the questline
---
So why should anyway care about this issue then!?
---
Im gonna roleplay as a human female and demand more orcish immigration in redridge and call anyone who criticizes me a scarlet crusader
---
How many people are on the beta ? 
---
How many wow streamers is there ?
---
&gt; I also notice you're using Disney as some sort of pejorative. Replace that word with Pixar and see if your argument still stands. 
---
yes
---
It looks like you want a safe space. Apparently telling someone to go away in a video game is worthy posting it online and trying to publicly shame the guy.
---
I agree with you that there is a good chunk of people hating on her because she's a girl, however I think there is a good portion, probably the majority of people who feel annoyed because she has no ties to WoW at all, she's a variety streamer that just plays whatever game is pulling in big numbers and relies on her personality to carry the stream. Honestly a game like Classic WoW will cater to her stream style a lot. But the majority of people hating are mad because they have been loyal to the game and have played since classic (like I have) and haven't gotten access to the beta.
---
These people haven't gotten access to the beta for a very specific reason, Blizzard has run the numbers and come out and said they think a lot of people will quit before level 20. Well if you give everyone the beta and they quit the beta before 20 thats one person who isn't going to pay a monthly sub or isn't going to add to the concurrent player base on launch day. Blizzard know private servers exist and anyone who TRULY wants to play Classic before release they know they will just go to a private server and play there.
---
TL;DR - People are mad because Pokemane isn't a veteran player but has access to the beta, Blizzard haven't given them access because they anticipate they may quit before hitting 30 and won't play Classic on release after trailing it on the Beta.
---
yeah i'm kinda with you, i've played D2, D3 and PoE and get bored fairly quickly.  it just sort of feels algorithmic - like you figure out your best spell, then you figure out your best stat, and off you go mindlessly spamming both.  You know the exact outcome of what you're doing, unless something random fucks you over
---
same reason i dont like dark souls.  the difficulty is artificial.  sure, you die a lot, but it's literally because it's designed to fuck you over with things you don't see coming until you have died multiple times and learn the pattern.  Once you do, it's just a case of pressing buttons in a certain order... big deal
---
You are the 99%
---
A lot of fanboys i see. lmao
---
Frost nova and nades are CC as well. Also they are twinked out. Like, what are you on about.
---
I don't think you can be too slow in classic. If you completed a pull, you mostly have to wait for your casters to regain mana. So you're only ever too slow if you don't pull when your group has full hp and mana.
---
lets all play runescape and pretend its wow?
---
Keep in mind they have farmed level 30 bis gear and then have a bunch of gear with no level requirment. It wont typically be this easy.
---
Ugh I tried tissues once, never again. Tastes much better off a shirt imo
---
I was just replying to your comment saying they would get banned. Im pretty sure they wont.
---
That said, in PvP Windfury was generally the best against non-tanks.  You *wanted* sudden burst that people couldn't handle, and consistency just made it easier for people to get defensive and kite you or pop cooldowns.
---
you are right, I edited my post, it was just interesting.
---
Honestly the classic client already has all the graphics options from the modern client, the Blizzcon demo even had the hd models in the files. They're the only thing that's missing.
---
A toggle for the WoD character models would be dope. Key word: Toggle. The two models actually coexisted for a time until they started revamping class animations, which gradually altered then removed the old models.
---
I know I know #nochanges but frankly there's already tons of visual and UI changes so that ship has sailed. Vanilla with a new coat of paint is something I could see appeal in. But every time it's suggested people go "I BET YOU WANT TO ADD LFR/LFG/DEATH KNIGHTS TOO" or something along those lines. Yes because wanting my tauren to not have Muppet mouth and shovel hands means I want gameplay changes...
---
&gt;it is a very legit way he has logged the data
---
On a pserver though. I hope he's going to do the same once classic is released.
---
It was so many years ago. I have 2 physical copy of the first release and 2 of TBC (I used to play with 2 accounts back then, cause I was crazy), and everytime I saw the box in the dark corner of my closet I used to think it was WoW. I'm starting to doubt myself. Maybe it was just a lie created by my brain..
---
It looks like a big clusterfuck of random spells to me. To be honest im more about having a tidy and clean UI than this, but whatever suits you. If you play long enough you dont really need to see your keybinds.  You can play with all the bar hidden as long as you can keep track of your cds.
---
8 fucking tanks! My guild only made it to 9/15 bosses, we never even attempted 4H. I don't think we managed to get past Gothik, but even if we did there's no way we could have found an extra 4 warriors with the right gear.
---
I may have to look into guild charter speedfarm routes.
---
Why would it be embarassing? Add-ons are easy to make because WoW supports them. The same way Starcraft and Warcraft had map editors, WoW has addons. You absolutely don't need addons to perform.
---
&gt;seeing later content before launch
---
The game has been out for 15 years....
---
Also the bug where you don't get dismounted and get to ride the wyvren at run speed on the ground 🤣
---
I actually thought tauren got the best outcome in the update. Trolls and night elves got it rough though...
---
Just btw. Raiding MC and BWL takes around 2 hours per week with 2 hours preparation for it.
---
I think 4 hours is something everyone that wants to play WoW can sacrifice.
---
Then there are PUGs for MC and BWL which will be slower but still successful. For example we will host an MC and BWL Pug every week! The MC one takes around 1h-1.2h, the BWL one around 1.5h-2h.
---
I'm set on leveling a paladin for the RPG experience and want an alt for convenience/actually doing the end-game. I'm thinking about mage/lock/priest.    
---
For mage it's the AOE farming, top tier dps in pvp/pve, good for wpvp, and teleports help a ton and are one of the biggest pluses for me.    
---
For warlock it's the pet tank, top tier dps in pvp/pve, decent for wpvp, best dueling class, can also facetank not needing to zoom around as much as the mage which is a plus for me.    
---
For priest it's the shields and heals even when shadow specced. I'd rather not heal in end-game but having the possibility to heal is still great. How op they are in pvp without needing much thought on what you're doing is a plus.
---
The OP probably had a worse UI than most, but mine was also quite bad (as were others I knew).
---
We were generally running 1024*768 on a 17 in crt.
---
You had 40 man groups, so that is 40 health bars on screen.  Then you have things like tank targets.  You obviously need your hotbars, which themselves can take up a lot of space on a lower resolution.  You need a threat meter and a combat/chat log.  You need some kind of buff frame, cooldown count and cc watch.  Oh, and of course your unit frames.
---
That's a lot to fit on a little screen space.
---
Fwiw, I think I got my first 23 inch 1920*1080 monitor in 2008.
---
Yeh, it was pretty similar for us. We actually made it to them but gave up basically right away as there was no way for us to get 8 tanks before BC.
---
They did hire a lot of ExWildstar artists prior to the update.
---
No it's true I really do have a lunchbox
---
I played Ragnarok Online too!
---
Yes they just got in like they had a warrant. No time to encrypt or do anything. It wás pretty shocking. It was a very strange day. They even searched the bathroom drawers, it was quite the violation of privacy but that's how it went.
---
&gt; players will inevitably burn through the Classic WoW content and look for more stuff to do
---
After Naxx comes Fresh.
---
Night elf or Dwarf hunter? Night elf for shadowmeld, which is a funny very useful ability, especially for wpvp. Dwarfs because they are cheeky bastards
---
I did still really like it. But yeah it had some issues.
---
&gt;  There have been a few discussions about what should come next 
---
I'm pretty sure we're at triple digits right now.
---
It’s not even that rare. A 3.81 drop percent isn’t bad at all.
---
Tusks of Mannoroth have a 0.25 drop chance.
---
I hope it’s fixed, it is literally game changing in world pvp and gives an advantage to escape when you see a large opposing faction nameplate coming towards you that you wouldn’t normally see
---
Maybe dont pollute so much and use a handtowel... casuals...
---
I've been watching the streamers, Asmongold, Esfand and Sodapop and a few others and trust me, I was there day one with WoW beta and Vanilla's launch and all through TBC... and it's pretty clear and obvious that the mobs and dungeons are easier.
---
*everything I've seen up to the of this post, shows that the mobs are easier*
---
I have seen managerial job postings in multinationals with less requirements than this.
---
Best of luck to your endeavour. However, I do believe you are taking a 15yo game way too seriously.
---
I don't know this streamer, but what point are you trying to make?
---
That you can harass a streamer? That he can report you if you harass a streamer?
---
Even then, do you think Blizzard will ban you for tagging his mobs, or killing him in PvP? Because those things don't violate ToS.
---
Yes, it is. It starts you off with a little communication, makes you more likely to chat, maybe ask what other quests they are doing, or just a simple "ty, bye" when you are done. Wordlessly joining groups is not Classic.
---
There is just no way you can say "old models looks better". They just dont. You make like them more but it doesn't mean they look better. They are hard to look at.
---
OMG NOCHANGES
---
I wish this topic would fuck off and stay fucked off for at least 2 years.
---
Everything was taking time.
---
But i would like to see some players raiding without DBM+KTM before telling that raids were so easy.
---
im 100% okay with that just gimme this graphic
---
Well, Old School Runescape saw this with high swap rates at the start, dwindling down in value. It is still in the Runescape community. I don't see why it would not be in WoW as well. Look it up, a lot of people Swap and probably in more games than RS. This is not banable by the developer of RS as they see it as a "trust trade" and not Real World Trading. We just have to wait and see how Blizzard would counter it. I hope I made some sense.
---
Ambitious. That's the kind of attitude I want in my WoW Classic guild!
---
Iirc AQ40/Naxx will be time consuming. 
---
Im not scared about BWL and MC when it comes to effort. I’ve been through all this before. But I’ve never raided AQ40/Naxx.
---
Ah boots of travel, great item
---
Git gud
---
I can’t see many AV’s happening with the number they currently have, and it won’t be a good example without epic mounts.
---
I was watching Snutz and half his gear was broken. Legs, gloves; bracers and belt.
---
Dwarf IMO. I think they look cooler.
---
No one would have noticed.
---
Bro this Boomer toxicitiy is insane on this subreddit, legit anyone would value pokimanes brand and stream over literally playing the game since vanilla it's not even comparable
---
Nah, I'd rather they finish the current story in the next expansion, then make a Warcraft IV start a new story, set a few hundred years after the BfA. Then they can make WoW2 to expand on that.
---
Blade and soul isnt an actual mmorpg in the way WoW is, mmorpgs arent only about competitive pvp. Actually they are very little about competitive PvP. You should turn to fighting games if you want hot action and competition. The games you cited have horrible UIs so.. (can't defend Rag's crap UI even if it's my favorite game from my childhood)
---
&gt; you are a dance master. 
---
 \- What do we say to the god of death?  
---
 \- Not today.
---
18 years and counting!
---
I can show you the world....
---
Hi, /u/Asibux
---
Lots of hard work from from people we'll never know to try and convince blizzard to stop being lazy.
---
In wotlk last phase of LK (the purge) dis something around 20-25 mil dmg as well
---
I firmly believe it will always be easier to farm gold in retail, so that doesn't make a difference. 
---
But honestly, if the gold is being earned legitimately by a real player, why does it matter..? That gold was still earned by *someone* on the server. It makes no difference to you, that gold is still entering the economy at the same rate as it could be if it was farmed by someone else. Somebody else still had to take the time to farm the gold in retail. It's not half as bad as some rich dude just straight up buying thousands of gold in one go.
---
[this](https://i.imgur.com/MzhOEjD.png) is the one I meant
---
Yep I have 2 lol
---
Set on druid still, still undecided on Horde or Alliance.
---
Can you sell me on either?
---
Dumbest post of the day goes to..
---
I’m not sure what streamer convinced people of that, but it was glorious seeing people complain about wasting gold enchanting their level 30 gear only yesterday.
---
There's only 2 reasons a tank ever needs more gear: defense or threat generation.
---
When it comes to gear for defense, no ones really rolling against them except offtanks and in the early raids, you don't really need any. An offtank wants the DPS gear anyway and just accepts whatever tank gear would otherwise get sharded.
---
Threat generation doesn't really become a problem in progression raids until your raid is well geared and wants to stop using their threat mitigation abilities for more DPS.
---
If you look at BIS lists, Fury Warriors and Prot Warriors don't share anything in the first 2 phases except an Axe off Onyxia and a Sword off Chromaggus in BWL. In fact, this trend continues through almost all content and if/when your guild gets a Thunderfury, it will stop too.
---
It's a pretty simple formula:
---
If your raid is pulling threat off the tank, the tank needs more DPS gear.
---
If your tank is dying early, he needs more defense gear and your healers need more gear.
---
In every other situation, you want your DPS to have as much gear as possible.
---
U bet i will hoping for my guild tô choose stream free server
---
Wait they will implement gold transfer ?
---
You won’t get into the beta,  none of us plebs will. Don’t worry about it.
---
&gt; Wordlessly joining groups is not Classic.
---
Weird, pretty sure thats exactly what I did.   
---
Dont try to force your ideas upon others. Non verbal communication is a thing, you know? If I see someone doing the exact same quest I will invite them. Then we will do the quest. None of that requires communication at all.
---
You act like there is some mystery around what happens in the long run on Vanilla servers. Private Servers have been running for a decade now and we know exactly what happens and what people want.
---
Fresh.
---
Curse of Recklessness.
---
Try 40 instead of 80?
---
1. This won't happen.
---
1. This art style wouldn't work with the game combat systems and animations. It would look weird.
---
No it's between players. So one person will trade retail gold for classic gold. Kinda like a trust trade
---
Still possible to get unlucky. I was Exalted with hydraxian waterlord faction in vanilla and only saw exactly one set of bindings and one rag hammer that entire time.
---
You can't add content to a preexisting MMO world that was not designed with that content in mind, without negatively impacting its pacing, socialization, and cohesiveness. This is where TBC failed. Diluting the population is just one of the many design disasters that come with expansions.
---
Ultimately, Theme Park MMOs collapse when you stack too many expansions on top of each other, so we need to answer deeper design questions:
---
* What does an expansion feel like if it doesn't increase the level cap or add new leveling content?
---
* Should the designers be allowed to completely delete old content, talents and mechanics in order to avoid bloat?
---
* 1-60 was not designed with additional content in mind, so should each expansion should have its own 1-60-like leveling pace to replace it with?
---
* Should any content post-60 be more Sandbox and less Theme Park? (or should expansions be seasonal instead of permanent?)
---
* Should players even be allowed to keep a character forever? Should they be forced to restart the leveling process along with everybody else, a la Path of Exile?
---
Hey everyone, I've been considering rolling a hunter, since I want to play a class that's capable solo and has a rotation a bit more complicated than spamming frostbolt. 
---
I've also heard that they are pretty shit in the later stages of vanilla, should I be concerned about not being able to find/keep a raid spot in AQ/Naxx?
---
&gt; I realise it might be early to think about
---
So early in fact that posts like these are temporarily banned from the subreddit.
---
Yup I’m glad they fixed it. Now the FC can afk hide for hours again.
---
Yes AQ40 starts to suck up time, after the first couple clears you get it down to 2 hours without PUGs tho. Naxx is just big
---
Gold from crafting professions is worse than zero sum.  In order to earn gold, another player has to pay you (or you get a tiny amount from a vendor).  All players have to pay gold to learn crafting recipes.  Therefore, crafting takes more money out of the game than it adds to the game.  That does not even factor in the time spent crafting and selling, which could be spent doing other things.
---
Some players will make gold from crafting, but far more players will lose gold with crafting professions.  If you don't already know how you will make gold then you will be one of the players who will lose gold.  (Alchemy might be an exception).
---
Gathering professions are not zero sum as they create things from nothing.  If you want to make gold from spending time on professions then go with gathering.
---
Yes there were a time. But its not like it took a very long time before every raider didnt have their small resolution screen FILLED with additional ui elements and addon screens.
---
Seal Team is a pretty good show.
---
The correct choice; Tauren. Be the big Natural beefy boi you were born to be.
---
I saw it drop once. Was given to the guild leaders girlfriend and the guild promptly disbanded.
---
Why do I feel like he was poisoned too
---
Dwarf because of the WoW trailer. Period.
---
Not really. It was very successful for its short life, they just didn't provide new content and it dried up.   If they had a solid content plan the RvR would have kept it going strong.
---
Those are not requirements but qualities. It's kinda implied that one person will not have it all, that's why you have a team-leading and coordinating 40 people and not 1 person.
---
Thank you for your best wishes.
---
Horde is way cooler than Alliance.
---
...But Tauren kitty form is so hideous, I personally can't stand looking at it. So for Druid I'd say Alliance.
---
So does one of my cousins, he had a chance meeting with the devs while he was in university. Was about to ask him for one, but then the resub fiasco happened (people got charged the sub like a million times) and having read the horror stories on their forums I decided against it. It didn't last much longer anyway, so not a big loss.
---
I don’t know the detail but there was definitely something suspicious going on with the younger sister shagger.
---
Hopefully a hero reserves the name and parks it for eternity.
---
Turn to face the change!
---
Jesus this sub had gotten fucking pathetic.
---
What are PUGs?
---
Honestly choosing between two.
---
I’m in a group of 5 (horde) and we have a 6 + 7 who can play with us if we need them.
---
We will be doing basically only PvE, dungeons / raids.
---
We have 3/5 DPS, 1/5 Healer, and then me.
---
Now I don’t mind tanking (my secondary character has always been a tank since Wrath hit where took my first alt seriously)
---
But in Vanilla, I didn’t tank or even in BC, I only started tanking seriously in MoP, and it’s by far very different and much easier later on.
---
As a main I played Hunter (Marksman) from Vanilla - Wrath and a Destro Warlock from Wrath - Legion (when I quit) 
---
I don’t want to play hunter again in Vanilla since I don’t want to do the whole feeding pet, ammo thing again. I don’t do healing (my friend in my group only does support in literally every game he’s played from league - hearthstone everyone since even we were in like grade 6 and is becoming a paramedic soon even in real life so he’s even a real life support)
---
I played range dps for a long time because it had no real risk in PvE (especially later on) but when I did tanking I found out by Legion why I love tanking because it had a risk to it, and a real strategy. I like thinking with my character, which is the primary reason why I decided to go back to classic, for the risk and more thinking involved.
---
For a tank I would be wanting to do the more obvious choice. A Prot warrior (most likely levelling as fury or arms though) or Shaman. A class I never tried before, has literally always interested me. Only problem is I don’t want to be roped into healing as I do not know why but I just really really hate healing. For Shaman I’d want to be Ele because I love the totem aspect especially in Vanilla, but personally Enhance seems better for dps and from what I’ve seen apparently Shaman isn’t that good on PvE in Vanilla?
---
Tl;dr:
---
I like risk and thinking with character. Used to play hunter but don’t want the feeding pet and ammo part.
---
Dislike healing.
---
Only doing PvE.
---
Mages were created to make warriors cry !
---
Private servers man. They are a god send.
---
If you don't have Beta access, you should just use the free starter edition of Retail.
---
http://wowprogramming.com/ is a decent resource.
---
Can we stop making these posts
---
That's inviting, not requesting to join. 
---
"Why do people hate retail features that weren't present in Vanilla, which directly lead to less communcation?" Gee I wonder
---
Was there any info about wow token in classic?
---
I said the technique makes them able to level faster than those other two. Honestly, kiting a hamstrung mob isn't very technical. It literally requires pressing a single button (hamstring) and the rest is just moving in and out of attack range. If this is too technical for one then they're going to be slow levelers anyway and all of this leveling planning matters little anyway.
---
Love that this again ends up being a discussion with someone who has never even tried it.
---
Yeah, i think they will keep the cap at 40 for like 3 weeks (so ppl play everything at that range), bumb it to 50 for 3 weeks and then to 60 for like a month.
---
I think my beta char is still like L14 or 15. Hadnt had too much time to focus on it, been moving and busy at work. Holiday starting soon, so im sure ill catch up.
---
Haha I used to do the same!
---
I was thinking the same thing as I have been watching these streamers... they certainly are making it look a lot easier than it is.
---
I hate that I love that I can hear the wing flaps perfectly.
---
Rockbitter when you wanna hold aggro of a mob.
---
Frostbrand when you want to slow your enemy down.
---
Flametongue... i dont know if it scales with spell damage, but its good with fast one hand weapons (daggers)
---
And windfury is good for a 2 handed weapon which has slow attack speed.
---
And then you get flametongue weapon at 36, and you want to switch to that. Go with the newest spell, it will be the strongest.
---
It’s fine to have your opinion about what type of content you prefer, but I don’t enjoy PvE content in MMOs. I don’t get any enjoyment from clearing the same AI content repeatedly. 
---
What I do enjoy is battling someone with a brain and determining which one of us is a better player.
---
That’s pretty idealistic of me because MMORPGs are rarely ever balanced (but BnS did a pretty good job in arenas anyways). 
---
Either way, that’s still the type of content I crave, and I’ll probably never be satisfied, but there’s something about MMO PvP that games like LoL just can’t compare to. It’s the environment, and the connection to your character because of all of the progression.
---
I think BnS UI is miles ahead of WoWs, but I also think BnS art style is better than WoWs, but you’d probably disagree with me there as well. That’s fine, there’s just no conversation to be had about the topic.
---
Hyjal as a questing zone includig a raid, emerald dream, kharazan crypt
---
As others have said, they're lvl 30 twinks, but also dungeons aren't nearly as hard as people seem to remember them being
---
I will never experience these quest lines as I can't stand the cartoonish, super mainstream pandaren. Therefore the design does undermine that.
---
Developing takes time and planning ahead prevents content drought. I'm sure the devs themselves have their eyes and ears open to what the community thinks should happen next at this point. Now might be your chance to have your opinion affect the future of Classic.
---
Depends on what you want to do. General PvP horde is better, but if you're planning on running premades you'll want to play ally. PvPing horde side is less frustrating because no shamans.
---
If you're interested in PVE and playing feral, Ally's better.
---
That’s like the statistical average.
---
You’re getting 1050 rep each run on bosses alone
---
They did keep the old ones though, it's still a graphics option
---
Wow  I totally forgot it used to be like this, they really are just so high up in the air on a straight line now
---
False
---
To say they're shit is not really fair. What people are saying is that Hunters do not scale as good with gear as Mages and Warlocks, for instance. Hunters bring enough to the table to warrant a raid spot, however. You shouldn't be worried about that.
---
Also: raiding isn't the only thing, my guy. The leveling experience as a Hunter is really great and immersive. At least it was for me, I was a Tauren Hunter in Vanilla. The only reason I'm not rolling it again is because I feel I already did that and I was a noob so always out of ammo (and mana)... On top of that I was always jealous or Priests with Benediction :)
---
Did they fix hunters yet?
---
Ah but trust me no one will need gold on retail.
---
Wtf are you on about? He literally just says go away. No-one has been banned from the beta for harassing streamers and you're an Alex Jones level tinfoil hatter if you think otherwise
---
Basically people have been dicks since the homo sapiens exists.
---
Ah, the classic warrior PoV
---
&gt;I mean I get it testing and all but with streamer culture it feels a bit sad that all of it'll be shown and done before launch?
---
Yeah, it was there for people to play for multiple years before. People have been playing the same content with minor changes for 5-6 years. But its the STREAMERS that do spoilers. And force you to watch their "content".
---
Man WAR was such a shameless WoW rip-off.
---
Trash stops giving rep at revered.
---
How does it do that? Is it available anywhere yet?
---
Change it so there's no changes.
---
My brain is melting!
---
The Dirges Kicking Chops would add another inch of steel on top of all that
---
I would go mining, then you can later use the stuff for engineering.
---
Just be aware that a lot of people will go mining/herbs for gold, so there will be some fighting for the ressources.
---
I was gonna say Hunter, but warlock or shadowpriest and mage are tough to beat IMHO
---
Now imagine the crying it would cause when the casuals downvote phase 5-6 and cockblock the progress. The gear differences grow wide those times.
---
Is a good point. Can only spread things so thin.
---
Hunters are unfortunately absolutely broken right now in Classic though. 
---
Hope they fix it.
---
Okay I tried to look into it, but I did state is as a question, because I've just heard about it. 
---
When Panser from Tradechat made a video not exactly praising the Nost movement, Mark Kern commented on it. I can't actually find these comments because everything is deleted, maybe someone has screencaps of it but I couldn't find them. The exchange between Kern and Panser didn't seem to go well though, but I can't find any evidence of him making threats to her. His fans did though. Panser then accuses Kern of sending his fans after her, I doubt he actively did this though. But merely commenting on her is enough for the already overzealous part of the movement to act out of line, especially on the internet. 
---
Interesting to find that lots of comments on this basically boils down Panser being an irrelevant feminazi and SJW who uses her boobs for views. I don't actually watch her content, but I can definitely feel the anti-women hostility that spews forth from many nerd communities. Very sad to see.

We are a group of people on fixed rotating schedules welcoming others who deal with the same issue. We plan to raid but the raid days will flip each week and late at night as we are all night shifters. Raid times in the frame of 11pm till 3am.
---
Looking for people who can't  commit to a fixed schedule every week but would still like to raid and organized pvp. 
---
This is the guild for people who don't work the typical Monday to Friday 9 to 5. We won't hold missing a raid against you and your welcome to fill in other guilds or pugs as needed. 
---
Loot system will have to be determined with how many people are able to be consistent but I like dkp the best. 
---
We are not assholes and won't terate that. Be nice help out. 
---
Most of us are military/law enforcement/and medical professionals so we have a sick sense of humor.
---
In what sense? I wouldnt want to burn myself out bu being a non streamer, but if you are a streamer  then its your job so you wont really get burnt out.
---
Alliance is already better in pvp because of Paladins.
---
"Pick up Group" basically a bunch of random People from different guilds squeezing into a Raid.
---
Organized PUGs mean a Guild will organise a Raidrun and fill some Spots with People that had to sit out from the Mainraid, couldnt attend or have alts. The rest will be filled by Random People joining over World-Chat.
---
So these will be faster since there will be mostly a core of 10-15 People from one Guild that knows what to do and explains the tactics on the Fly.
---
Loot system in PUGs are usually Prio -&gt; +1. That means if Magma drops Hunters Strike only Rogues and Furys can roll on them, if Fritz gets the Hunter Strike he gets an +1 on the list and can't win another Roll against Hans before Hans also has a +1.
---
None. Blizzard hasn't said anything about that or anything else available in the in-game shop that might make it into Classic.
---
Haha, I will change it, I suppose I will change it.
---
Dwarf has better PVP racials. (Stoneform deals with crippling poison.)
---
Thanks for clearing that out!
---
And that's setting the bar low!
---
TBC was in my eyes perfection and WotLK peaked and then started to go downhill there at the end and WoW just kept going downhill ever since.
---
So having TBC only servers would be a good thing I think.
---
i remember videos of 60 tanks taking 8-40dmg
---
Ok this is fantastic
---
The treatment of a god? Most people on this sub are still shitting on him. And regardless of what he has or hasn't done in his life, it doesn't change that fact that he had a hand in making the original game and convincing blizzard to give us classic.
---
Dwarf because fuck elves. Also dwarven hand cannon.
---
Oh yeah, guessing i should do a photoshoot of my CE's.
---
I was so hyped for Warhammer Online. 
---
Sad story.
---
First everyone complained about streamers herding together their fanbase and annoying other players with their sheer number... 
---
Now, a streamer ACTUALLY does de opposite and tells the fans that he wants to be left alone and people are still getting annoyed?
---
Make up your mind
---
None.  If you want to get to 60 asap then don't take professions until level 60 (except first aid).
---
Any profession will slow you down while levelling.  Skinning is by far the fastest profession for a rogue, if you really want to take one.
---
Sounds like you need to roll Warrior. 
---
If rolling a Shaman: yes, be prepared to get pigeonholed into a healing role. Folks can say otherwise, but that's just how it is. Even if you do actually go Elemental and support yourself with runes, pots, flasks etc. (expensive hobby), the item distribution priority will favor Mages and Warlocks over an Ele Shaman. In short: you won't get a lot of (bis) gear.
---
Ft is level 10.
---
I get it. I just don't see how it would matter. It's not creating gold out of thin air, so... who cares? Somebody could have 70 billion gold in BFA, but they'll still have 0 in Classic when it's released, and only slowly accumulate it afterward. I'm really not seeing what the issue is.
---
 There is a insane rep grind you can do for an epic mount out there 
---
Yeah, i remember vividly doing it and also that not too long after, Blizzard changed it to the repeatable quests that took a lot less time.
---
Yeah, but there's like 8 topics like this a day, why not just comment on one of those? Did you really think that you were the only one with this unique thought?
---
As a dps that never use threarmeters, I can confirm
---
Hey mate, I am also going to main a hpala as they are so much fun in pvp and end game isnt that bad. 
---
My alt will be a warlock as they are easy to lvl and really easy to play end game. once you paladin is geared with mc gear i don't want to have to think about the place so a warlock is just dot and cast shadow bolt i could listen to music or watch tv or something while doing it. 
---
Thats my thoughts.
---
Usually people tend to herbs because in classic you will have to use a ton of consumables, a lot of them require herbs.
---
After a couple of months I think mining will be superior since this time, everybody an their mother will take engi for PvP. So many people will buy ores to reduce down time.
---
While leveling I would take skinning because you kill a lot of mobs anyway and you can vendor the mats. It will take time before you can actively sell stuff on the AH if you are not experienced in flipping items. In addition with either herb or mining
---
http://reddit.com/r/classicwowplus
---
Idk if thats vanilla (probs is) but you can stealth mine some sweet nodes inside certain instances
---
From a holistic stand point? It's effective design. You're simply not the target audience. *Good* design does not try to be all things to all people, nor does it try to cater to everyone.
---
There is nothing inherently cartoonish or “mainstream” (lol whatever that means) about Pandaren that can't also be said about silly male Taurens, with their goofy smiles and expressions, or female Worgens.
---
Ultimately, good design elicits a reaction and challenges you to participate. If your prejudices are such that you can't even allow yourself to buy a ticket and take a ride, then that responsibility falls on you.
---
Mists of Pandaria has a *clear,* cohesive, holistic vision and its design choices all work in concert to support its storyline, including the folksy, whimsical Pandaren design, which ultimately acts as a subtle contrast to the evils that befall the race. Once again, this is *good* design.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I loved it and played it a lot. The bamboozled part was that it died.
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
Oh look "i didn't knew 3 million of these exist" thread.
---
&gt; I realise it might be early to think about, but players will inevitably  burn through the Classic WoW content and look for more stuff to do.  
---
Thank's for putting me into that category, next time ask me first. So i guess you will put a time limit on people to "complete" the game?
---
As i said Everyone wants something, blizzard tried to make them all happy. That's why we get classic now and that's why Retail dwindled.
---
Those weren’t part of the core game however. You weren’t able to edit SC2 ranked play to say... reveal your opponents actions the same way you can in WoW.
---
I think mods are great for building communities and adding to the longevity of games, but in private environments only. Don’t force your mods onto the public community. “Forced” meaning needing to use to be competitive.
---
Rogue/bm hunt
---
Felwood leading into Winterspring was great as well. Up up up the stairs .. and then .,... into the tunnel.....
---
Odd, my wife just rolled her eyes and told me to "grow the fuck up, you're almost 50 for christ's sake".
---
Then she muttered something about me helping with the kids, who I presume are the little people I see running around in my house whenever I leave my cellar gaming room.
---
Well he fighting prob. against lowies, if he would do a Tripple-Kill vs high Skilled people prob. otherwise yeah xD I mean he loosing to Random Warlocks in Open World /kappa
---
If I'm deep prot, I go with TPS gear and shield  so I can Shield Slam, it'll be your only damaging ability worth anything. Dual wield isn't worth it imo.
---
And yet, there is never enough tanks
---
As mentioned below its tukui the earlier version of Elvui.
---
The guy is called Musclebrah and he has a discord [https://discord.gg/NhQZZ3](https://discord.gg/NhQZZ3) with addons etc on it might list here if you want to take a look.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Well, on that spec KILLING mobs is out of the question, dont see ANY warrior grinding mobs for gold. Regardless of spec. 
---
Just do gathering professions then.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/WoW_AddOn
---
 Is very helpful
---
Probably because the way you worded the topic. This implies a Blizz feature where you can transfer gold from your retail characters to your classic characters.
---
However, as you actually discuss the option of a two people transaction, one giving the other gold on retail for the other to give them gold on classic (at whatever rate) ...
---
WHY would this be a problem? As others have stated, there is no real money involved, so not against the TOS - strictly speaking. Also, as long as the Classic gold (same for Retail) was acquired via legitimate means (no hacks/botting/whatever), I don't see a problem here. Someone worked for that gold, be it the same person spending it or another, the gold will have the same value. Similarly, if I like to grind, but my friend doesn't and I share my earnings with him (because I'm such a good friend) and he buys me a case of beer every now and again (totally unrelated, due to TOS) ...
---
Also this should be rather low key and not that widespread to affect prices on the AH.
---
However hacking/botting for gold are issues that Blizz needs to solve. Not sure how it is these days, but in Vanilla there were gold farming bots everywhere. I really hope they have a solution for that this time around.
---
i think youd be shocked to hear that theres much more players not streaming on beta.
---
I wish my company was as well managed as Wowhead is
---
They really need to add a rule about just trying promote your videos like they do in the regular WoW Reddit.
---
invites are random u dont get any prio because ur account is from 2006
---
You lucky bastard.
---
It's not that hard to do. Priests can solo am graveyard. We farmed sm graveyard  with 3 mages, a warlock and a priest. Did huge pulls and aoe'd it down.
---
You’re more likely to run into consistent herbs while leveling than you are mining nodes. Mining modes are always on the fringes of maps, tucked away in valleys and caves. Herbs are just everywhere.
---
This means you’ll have to spend more time looking for mining nodes, which takes away from your leveling speed and the sooner you can get to 60, the sooner you’ll be at your farming peak.
---
That's indeed an option. But personally I wouldn't like it if all my progression got wiped one day. Assuming they wipe the same servers regularly that is.
---
On the other hand if they made fresh servers every so often less and less people would be tempted to start over each time don't you think? Leaving the old servers barren over time. Thinning the population.
---
I'm not a private server player so I've not experienced it. But don't some private servers create new content too?
---
It's really hard to say after watching that level 30 duel tournament, there were fights in that, that I assumed would be very one sided and the skill aspect came into play massively. Like ziqo for example.
---
No. 
---
Respect, but a very bad idea I think. 
---
Classic needs to stay classic, not creamy classic.
---
I would say tripple zeros at minimum
---
Offtopic: what does "ORB" stand for?
---
Ontopic: Thing is, sometimes you just need to kill stuff yourself. Im not talking about "spending 10 hours grinding a spot as prot warrior", hell no. I know thast a terrible idea. But lets say i need to farm 20 cloth for whatever fucking thing im doing, or to solo some quest etc. Do i do that as full prot with shield slam, or do i grab a dps gear (in prot spec)?
---
Video games are great and all but to be honest spending time with your family is pretty priceless. Enjoy them while you still can
---
Lol. Givez me ur goldz!
---
The problem, why engineering wont make gold is, that you actually need engineering to use all that stuff. So the market is very thin and 99% of engineers just make those things for themselves. You can, however sell Gyrochromatom, Bronze Tubes(A) or Deadly Blunderbusses(H) for early gold gain, since all these items are needed for quests.
---
Wf proc rate is just 20percent, is it not??
---
Shield slam ends up being better for this than 2h / dw?
---
I get that and I am only 40 😀
---
You do it in DPS gear with a shield.
---
Ah yeah, you're right. Chance is 20% but extra attacks will benefit slower(2H) weapons more.
---
Share your mog
---
Hunter will kill anything but stealters.
---
Rogue and Druid will kill Hunter.
---
Thats unlucky :/ I have read everywhere though that they actually think about who to invite. 
---
Have you got any sources by any Chance?
---
[No.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Healer)
---
Yeah, in my experience. 
---
There's a damage penalty on your off-hand when you dw and you can only use Whirlwind and Overpower for instant attacks.
---
hanging with tha boiiiiiiiiiizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - Cody Garbrandt - Human Warrior
---
They are probably using pots/food buffs and have all their gear enchanted and have the best of gear. So yes, its possible to pull huge packs, as long as all the players are well geared and playing well.
---
Thank you. That’s true I’ll always be expected to roll healer for shaman which I really do not like to do. And that’s true that it would be much harder to fear myself up, and in classic it’s much harder to come by gold and etc, and having expensive hobbies would not be great as well.
---
Oh right, the orbs. For some reason i thought ORB was an abbreviation (like DME = dire maul east) and my mind totally blanked, haha.
---
The anti-streamer community seems to forget this equation.
---
Wife here again
---
Bruh
---
I was just talking to a friend about this today!
---
Anal [Eviscerate] always made me chuckle.
---
Warrior tank for sure
---
!RemindMe 85 days
---
So that means you only have 21 runs to exalted.
---
The average guild would do that in a month easy
---
i know, but i must resist :(
---
Mining is good for a rogue, as you can stealth into nodes and use distract to make the mobs look away, while you mine. Saves u from having to clear areas to get to the node like most other classes.
---
Except they aren't using correct values themselves.
---
If you need that itch tho... By all means.
---
If the kids are old enough put them to work on warcraft.
---
My video covers that. But people here seem to just want to be toxic to people trying to produce content and never actually watch it. Read the first posts to this thread they automatically flamed me because I posted my own video, they automatically disagreed with me without even watching the video/understanding the topic/understanding my pov. It's sad really. And for those who hate this post because of self promotion, well that's how people get discovered - if you only want to watch established people then be my guess but those content creators also started from the bottom. I also thought people would be more civil in their discussions. But oh well - at the end of the day I made the video because I enjoy making them.
---
Farm herb or mining nodes. They dont fight back.
---
Really? Damn didnt know. Thats cool then I guess.
---
Zug Zug.
---
The average guild is not doing 5 MC clears every week. Where are you getting that idea from?
---
Agreed. How many times do you actually watch a flight anyway? Tab out or whatever so time length is irrelevant. On the occasion i do stay on screen this would be a cool change.
---
Kezan should be the island southwest of the malstorm.
---
This is what a MMO is all about, this is what community and adventure should look like, Awesome story, thanks for sharing!
---
Well thats good to hear
---
And causes most of the breakups of the group ... I/F for forming, then FP to Southshore and then .. oh shit, mommy calls its time for dinner types of drama... HS back to I/F and get the group again. (CD 1 hour so cant have that twice in a row).
---
Ah the blissful days of marriage before the release date.
---
Enjoy it OP, the notes after august arent gonna be that lovely i bet :P
---
Im not asking "how do i make gold" on warrior :p
---
Im asking "if i have to kill stuff, how do i kill it?"
---
&gt; Offtopic: what does "ORB" stand for?
---
Stratholme live wing runs that drop Righteous Orb's. Used in Crusader enchant and +healing enchats (some in later phases). These usually sell for something like 30g ( -+10). Also needed in priest BIS chest craft.
---
Quite common that tank reserves the first orb and the rest are rolled (RR).
---
Wouldn't bet on it being 100% random. They probably have some sort of split for accounts based on usage statistics/hardware you play on. And they might target some segments more than others for invites at given times. But inside the segment, it's still random - probably.
---
It is more high definition, lighting is better, more details, etc..  
---
Still looks like a game though... a \*modern\* game. It doesn't tickle my imagination.
---
In fact it has the opposite effect on me - I think it looks uninspired. I am sorry!
---
Nostalrius wasnt pvp? Thought is was, hmmm
---
ive played since BC and experienced classic on Nost . I wanted it so bad , ive even set up my "prefered beta " thingy on blizz's website.
---
Yeah i know what the orbs are - i just thought for some reason ORB was an abbreviation (like DME = Dire Maul East) :p
---
!Remindme 85 days
---
Yeah the thought of DPS using threatmeters instead of damagemeters sounds crazy these days.
---
I mean Mages get Ice Barrier and Shatter. Last tourney a Mage won it without either of those. 
---
BM Hunters will be strong but the Mage can Ice Block the Bestial Wrath duration. SL will be strong but again you’ll see Mages killing the pet while the Warlock is sheeped for 20 seconds.
---
Sounds like mage is what you want
---
20 % per swing, let's say for a second there was no attack-power: then  fast or slow weapon wouldn't matter. But with attack power coming in, slower weapons scale more.
---
It's not in the picture tho.. 🤔
---
&gt; I wouldn't like it if all my progression got wiped one day.
---
Why not?
---
You're rubbing up against one of the core limitations of Theme Park MMOs. What does progression mean in a world with a clear beginning and a clear end? What does progression mean in a static, persistent, evergreen world?
---
Ultimately you either leave the world, or change the surroundings enough that it becomes *like* a different world, and your character is artificially gimped again, giving you the illusion of infinite progression. This is the retail model. 
---
It's not the only model, but some expectations would need altering. Every design choice has a price. Maybe keeping your character's progression is something better suited for Sandbox MMOs (like EvE Online) and not Theme Parks.
---
&gt;it's going to be especially crowded
---
Why i will wait 1-2 weeks before i start myself. I'd hate to skip Westfall on Alliance (humans) though, lost of good stuff in there leading up to Deadmines. Elwyn Forest, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood then into STV :)
---
I'm waiting for this as well.. Windfury animation and combat text is also completely scuffed.
---
I'd only go as far as 10
---
You really want your mom to have to wash a cum stained towel?
---
I, UH, I WANNA WATCH YOU BLEEEEEDDDD
---
Nah, I actually agree that the night elves should be the mexicans. The orcs came in and took the land and now are pissy that the night elves are moving freely in what used to be their land despite the borders that exist now. Seems pretty accurate.
---
Mind vision / Track
---
Really enjoyed the game, rip
---
&gt; But personally I wouldn't like it if all my progression got wiped one day.
---
Why would anything be wiped?
---
Is there really a barrents chat thing for alliance? its the only thing i feel bad about rolling ally in Classic.
---
Wait, people are actually trying to test things in the beta instead of hosting streaming events to boost their own sub count and make a shit-ton of money? 
---
What universe is this?
---
Flower picking would give you fade leaf for blind and then there is alchemy for the rest or was blinds need of fade leaf vanish in 1.12
---
If you find a guild to begin with, you are golden. 
---
If you are a good member of the guild they won't kick you out for not enough dps.
---
Finding a guild is question of DPS/Role, Staying in a guild is question of personality
---
Not into dinosaurs as a kid?
---
Good point, and this gives a good example of the class in classic!
---
I vote for repeating the cycle up to the end of the wotlk.
---
Vanilla and first 2 expansions are amazing,they complete so many storylines people grew up with (wc) and are the high point of the game.
---
Assuming they go with that we're looking at the solid 6+ years of pure joy.
---
As for what happens next..it's a gray area.Reseting servers would anger many players ( apart from the extremely hardcore 0.01 % who would ever want their hard earned progress wiped?).
---
Keeping servers up for more than 2/3 years without new content will kill the game as everyone and their brother will be walking around in max level gear also making the gameplay extremely hostile for new potential players (affects both pvp and pve. Pvp - you simply dont stand a chance as a new player vs naxx/sunwell/icc geared people.
---
Pve- certain amount of elitism comes into play and people start demanding unreasonable gear requirements for ecerything like lfm ony full t2 geared + only/the dreaded GS).
---
It leaves blizz with possbility of repeating the full cycle completely up to the current expansion or shutting down servers at some point..unfortunately it's the only possible outcome.
---
"For the Horde!" actually has an Alliance counterpart, named "General Drakkisath Demise"
---
It is very possible they are going to leave it that way as this is how a great deal of botting was done in Vanilla.
---
Is your wife single?
---
I think I'm in love with your wife, never met her but I'm pretty sure lol
---
Sitting on the floor, back put against the sofa, and then as much pillows as you need below your butt to use keyboard/mouse comfortably was my secret recipe. What a time it was
---
lol this sub actually excist
---
The more clips I see like this the less excited for Classic I become. The AoE mass dungeon pulls, everyone spamming any AoE they have can stay in retail.
---
Yep, and you could set priority groups. Each Mage in the RAID would get a different order and spam like crazy. Mine might be Tanks, then Healer, then DPS. Another would be Healers first. And so on. So if one mage went down the others would eventually cover everyone. In one of the MC fights we were told NOT to DPS. Our only responsibility was Decursing. It was that important.
---
You’re right.
---
The shortest amount of time is 8 weeks.
---
helps when you're the masterlooter ;)
---
I remember the day Blizz announced they were going to allow character name changes in WoW. Lots of people trying to escape reputations. But then Blizzard posted a list of the old &amp; new names of everyone who paid to change. Good times.
---
I covered why it's a problem in my video but no one seems to care to watch it. tldw; classic is meant to be a fresh start for all, the rich people will be able to swap tonnes of gold over putting them leagues ahead of everyone. This can lead to many negative effects such as market manipulation.
---
They would be lot faster if they swapped the shaman and warlock for 2 more mages.
---
Kudos to you! Play what you enjoy, that's how it should be.
---
Too bad that people confuse/equate viable to efficient/optimal most of the time.
---
- Bad cable management
---
- Desk curved the wrong way
---
- To expansive annoying microphone
---
- Vertical monitor
---
Personally I hate it. But I like the lights.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
The class I've already decided - Warlock - the faction I still haven't.
---
I've always told myself that if I could do it all over again I'd main an UD Warlock (mained Tauren Shaman). However, I'm afraid that the Horde will offer fewer PvE opportunities than the Alliance.
---
I plan on mostly doing PvE content (from dungeons to raids, albeit a lot more casually this time around) with some PvP sprinkled here and there. From what I've read about pservers the Horde is where more PvP oriented players float to, where as the Alliance has more PvE minded ones.
---
In your experience/expectation, will PvE/PvP balance between the factions be about the same or will we see a much heavier PvP focus on the Horde side, enough that PvE focused (casual) players will have a harder time finding like minded players, guilds, groups, etc?
---
Good question!
---
You go herb/alch because it gives you some extra gold for the chance of farming mss/lotus and for how self-sustainable you become making your own raid consumes.
---
As a hardcore raider eng is more useful because you're presumably playing enough to make plenty of gold anyway and chicken/ports-to-tanaris/sapper-charges give your raid more utility and slight dps improvements.
---
That's why you see the difference in recommendations!
---
At many points yes. Like I said I played for a long time, I’ve grown up during that time and I’ve been very dumb in trade chat at times, and I’ve also had trouble defending myself against trolls when I was younger
---
Did somebody recommend you a Dwarf already?
---
KEVIN!
---
Frontstabbing/frontshredding is a thing from private servers. Does not work on classic
---
Since when were there politics in barrens chat?
---
For 6 months straight, I was a 100% sure I was rolling a Warlock. Now, however, I'm shifting between two options for my main: **PRIEST** and **MAGE**.
---
Reason for not picking Lock: I already played one, but I don't like them in a raiding environment. Love them in open world PvP, but that's about it. 
---
With my **Horde** guild, I'll be raiding two times a week. When playing solo (or with a friend or two), I like doing dungeons, some BG's and world PvP / gathering professions. 
---
I really dig healing in raids, but I'm not a fan of healing BG's. Also I don't fancy the idea of being squishy in world PvP. My fear is that when I roll Priest, I'm kinda f\*cked in that department. Re-speccing every week to Shadow seems way too expensive and unsustainable, sadly. My reasoning behind \*maybe\* picking a Mage is the sweet DPS, high utility, money-making capabilities and (world) PvP toolkit. In raids I find them to be quite boring, however. 
---
**What would you pick, given these two options?**
---
You shouldn't have problems finding groups for anything as either faction, even though Alliance is more pve oriented and the horde is more pvp, that's just racials and paladin vs shaman.  
---
But, if all you want is pve, and you play a warlock Alliance side, guilds will fight over you. Warlocks on Alliance are likely the least played class, or one of the least played class at least, and everyone needs a few of them.
---
Porque no los dos?
---
You get rank one at lvl 10, yes. Then you get rank four at lvl 36.  Go with the newest spell, it will be the strongest.
---
I've been thinking I want to go human warrior tank, since I was our guilds 2nd tank for a lot of faction firsts in vanilla through AQ when I quit. 
---
But all these polls showing the number of people rolling wars have me concerned. Thinking about going mage instead... I had a mage alt in vanilla but never got past lvl40. 
---
Time is also a big restriction now, job, wife, you know the deal. So mage would be better in that regard too. 
---
Whatcha think? Stick with what I know, or try something new?
---
Faction balance will depend on server to server. Really hard to say. Since we‘ll be getting both kinds of servers. I recommend a PvE Server. Undead WL is probably your best bet as WotF is also good in PvE as well as PvP.
---
Yeah man, dont forget to grab the flightpoint.
---
We are living in the past, but not that much in the past. Gameplay will stay old but memes will not.
---
Mage with Ice Barrier
---
Depends on the shitty made up rules. Stealthers guranteed first hit seemed kind of rediculous. It‘s a major point getting someone out of stealth in bgs aswell as it is on arenas.
---
It’s made me realise I like the idea of playing a Shaman a lot more than actually playing a Shaman.
---
True. Very true
---
And then it sucked, and Mythic/EA killed it with the bank account charge bug, that scandal was huge D:

These look absolutely amazing, Mind me asking what size print you decided to go for? how does it look once printed? and which version did you use?
---
I am totally having this on my wall somewhere!
---
Do you want to be a cow and live in mudhuts or crypts, or be a majestic elf living close to nature in living trees or medieval fantasy castles.
---
Yeah it's crazy... F*ck streamers in General!
---
Ohh wait - but I love watching streams of them playing my game... But I don't want them playing my game..
---
/s
---
Just mind-boggling...
---
A PvE server is not something I'm considering right now. Even tho I'm planing on PvEing much more that PvPing, I also want to PvP some.
---
What you mention about Warlocks on the Alliance side is one of the reasons holding me back from making my final decision. OTOH, I love the Undead casting animations :D
---
KEK
---
Yeah wtf happened there
---
The testing was actually tedious.
---
I work in energy generation at a plant and spend all day overseeing codes, standards, implementations, general safety etc. so to come home and spend another several hours testing was quite a task.
---
Very tempted to long on my pserver main/Bfa main and raid but stuck to it.
---
But yeah, levelling to 40 and repeating the process again would be a bit much.
---
!remindeme 83 days
---
Level an alt for a bit and come back a bit later.
---
This is beta for a version of the game that the majority of us have already played. Am I missing something? Why is everyone frantic to get into beta?
---
I always thought the point of getting into beta was to find the best leveling path and the best way to max professions to make all that early gold and learn the dungeons and raids so you can yell at the people who fuck up on mechanics on launch day and to get mad views on your YouTube channel by posting early looks at the new content... Oh and something about reporting bugs.
---
No kidding, back in Vanilla one of my guildies would get his daughter to farm for him on his Hunter. She was only 7yo or something.
---
I got promoted last month and begin new position on the 26th of Aug right after 5 weeks vacation . Means I gotta focus tons on new position. I do however sit on 52 saved vacation days and I dont mind taking a few down the line (like october) when things are settled both ingame and irl. Or the good ol work from home office. I envy you tho!
---
I hate how that the industry has turned towards easy instant gratification bullshit. I can understand why the industry became this way (way more profitable to make a shitty and addictive game rather than a fun one), but I absolutely hate it.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bx0lz1/-/) has been removed for Rule 7.
---
This is barely anything to do with Classic gameplay and seems to just be about a streamer himself. Also it is a misleading post title (who is getting banned, and for what?), so the post has been removed.
---
 If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bx0lz1/-/).
---
I meant balance more in PvP and PvE focus on the same faction and less population balance between factions.
---
Class fantasy wise, I really like Undead Warlock and I also really like Undead casting animations.
---
It's base AP doesn't scale with gear and also puts a debuff which reduces heals on you by 50%. It's alright but nothing game changing
---
Yeah that's a great one until (or if) you get an arcanite fishing pole. Fishing and cooking synergize really well so if you level one, be sure to level the other. It pays off in the end.
---
I would try and play the class you really want to play. If you wanna roll tank I would find a guild and solidify yourself as one of the guilds dedicated tanks. If you want more solo options and have an easier time rolling solo or some pug dungeons mage might be slightly better for solo play. Perhaps try out a private server till launch and maybe that helps you choose?
---
I'm convinced by tauren firenova-&gt;stomp-&gt;chainlightning-&gt;shock-combo, you'd be suprised how many warriors dont wear their pvp trinket.
---
2 minutes cooldown, if you hit more than 1, more value. I do not dare to say that tauren is better - there are situations where either of those are strong(er)  but i am convinced that most ppl  unterestimate tauren and overestimate orc for shaman.
---
Let’s be honest, there was plenty wrong with the old models. Especially night elves. Night elves didn’t even have actual glowing eyes, they just had yellow eyes with glowing orbs in front of them. It looked awful when you looked at it closely.
---
Also, male night elf walk animation... Like they just walked away from getting fucked in the ass.
---
find basic addons.. ones that only have a few files or just a single file.. learn how they do 1 task.. the n find some that do 2 or 3 tasks.. even if you don't understand all of it.. then trial and error your way through one.
---
you can use the retail client but depending on your addon it may or may not work 100% in classic. see if you have any friends with beta access or make a post once you have an addon ready for testing and see if anyone is willing to test.. or check the classic wow discord and ask in their addon channel if anyone will test an addon for you.
---
Dont agree here.  
---
I have one of my favorite songs as a wakeup alarm for 7 years now, still love it and makes me start the day with a little smile.  
---
Waking up is not a bad moment of the day. I try to get enough sleep, I like my job, I workout, eat healthy: I have no issues waking up in the morning. I often feel fresh and happy, the song might even contribute to it.
---
Was this the first "WoW-Killer", there's been hundreds but was this the first?
---
&gt;classic is meant to be a fresh start for all, the rich people will be able to swap tonnes of gold over putting them leagues ahead of everyone
---
Well, they will still need people interested in swapping their hard earned Classic gold for Retail gold. It is unlikely that there will be too many of those around in the beginning - mainly due to it being a fresh start and everyone starting out from 0. So unless there is going to be a major botting/hacking problem or some streamers getting a ton of donations from their fans in Classic gold, I don't see it becoming a major issue anytime soon.
---
I've heard that they removed being able to change nameplate distance. Has anyone confirmed?
---
Personally for me it's just my favorite zones and quests continued(Trisfal, Silverpine ect) Forsaken vs the Scarlet crusade is my favorite lore and shit goes DOWN in the Plauge lands.
---
Make an alt, have a priest for raid and dungeon healing or when grouped and a ranged dps for world and battlegrounds. Or ask your guild to help respect your priest to holy/disc for raids
---
Priest you will always have something to do. Im not sure how much they have to respec. Mage you will have the ability to do any aspect of the game you want and be good at it. Maybe try leveling a priest on a private server and see how you like it?
---
Damn I want that cup.
---
Ikr, he has sooooo much unused space
---
Orbicular Righteous Balls?
---
It was a shit version of Daoc tbh. even the engine was the same. old and bad
---
its very simple. 
---
1. you take the pve prebis list.
---
2. you remove all items that do not have +stamina.
---
3. you replace the removed items with the best runner up that does give +stamina.
---
4. you can run in theae items until phase 3 during which you can get the rare pvp set.
---
the max is now at 20 I was testinv it a bit yesterday.. use the GetCVar("nameplate a Distance") to see what it's set to.
---
Psh your a Hunter, I don't even wanna hear a god damn peep out of you about leveling :) 
---
Level a warrior lol.
---
&gt; (way more profitable to make a shitty and addictive game rather than a fun one
---
Actually, it isn't.
---
The industry, by and large, is in a down currently. The reason why they shifted towards instant gratification, is different: **Market Saturation**
---
When I was a teen, there were 3-4 games mentioned in popular gaming journals that came out each month. Today, we have dozens of new games PER DAY, all of them competing for attention.
---
currently 20
---
They want to boost private server popularity to stick it to the activision man.
---
i think a siphon life build would be better all around.
---
run Fellhunter against a mage, you can just devour the sheep and you also gain access to your spell lock at lvl36 which is big.
---
Find a dedicated horde raiding guild in the time we have before release and you shouldnt have much to worry about. As for inbalance on a server; i dont know if anyone can answer that question at the time it will depend server to server and if they ever release the stats for each server.
---
Ret paladins, repetence, crit build and the pursuit of justice 8% movement speed combined with minor speed from boots. I don't think anybody can stop them depending on their gear
---
Rogues started using their own blinding powder/vanishing powder come 1.12
---
Not really a fan of the timer and the last team to cap wins mechanic.  I do like the debuff on the flag carrier though, because some teams would be lame and turtle with the flag in their flag room/GY forever.
---
I'm struggling with the same choice, but here's one thing that's tipping me in favor of the mage: Teleports.  
---
I thought about going from Stormwind to Dolanaar to learn the spider leg recipe and get easy skills in cooking, but then I realized I had to spend around 30 minutes just getting there, and then hearth or do it again for 30 minutes. As a mage you do it once to get the teleport, then you can be in any corner of the world in 5 seconds. That's a huge time saver.  
---
If that's not your thing, mage is borderline broken in vanilla, they have the best ranged dps for both pve and pvp, they have multiple specs that work, including a instagib one that's great fun when bored, they can aoe grind like noone, they can do everything in the game as a top performer, even have the best cc. Only things you can't do are heal and tank.  
---
Priests are not that helpless in wpvp, the shield absorbs a ton and you can generally just wand people down and use sw:p while healing yourself. It's not high apm or fun, but you're not helpless either.
---
That was amazing!!!
---
&gt; and use distract to make the mobs look away, while you mine
---
The view-direction only influences the chance of mobs detecting you in stealth. Once you start to mine, you unstealth, and normal aggro range applies.
---
Minor details most aren't going to notice.
---
&gt;stress
---
Mine has gone as well :( i didnt make it to the 2nd test so i hope i am not removed from the 3rd one :( FeelsBadMan
---
Man, this looks glorious!
---
Find a guild and get a spot before launch and you have nothing to worry about.
---
If you're deep prot, you'll have one hand specialization and shield slam. Stick with shield slamming as it will do more damage than a 2 hander or dual wielding would. Your best bet is to put on your highest damaging one hander and "damage shield" gear like nagelring, shield spike, un-goro crystal buff (the damage shield one,) essence of the pure flame, drillborer disk/skullflame shield/force reactive disk, etc.  
---
Mobs will hurt themselves for hitting you while you won't be taking that much damage. Shield slams still do decent damage since it's an instant ability, and your survivability will be much higher than if you didn't use a shield. It's slower going, but you can still kill stuff.
---
1.13 is already in beta and it's better than TBC
---
Just to let you know, you know you cant ride the skeletal horse mount right?
---
Find a group of people to play with that you like and that will most likely help.
---
Where would you recommend?
---
Jesus. I swear this subreddit is just blind with nostalgia, Wtf do you mean “timeless”? They might have a certain ‘charm’ to them, but they’re certainly not up to par with any modern game. They look old. They do. And, news flash, people’s tastes are changing, and not everyone wants bad graphics for the sake of nostalgia. ‘Timeless’ my ass.
---
[Itemization.info](https://Itemization.info) has an extensive database of what's added when, it'd be great if you could implement that functionality in your site. Maybe you could talk to them and do a collab?
---
Only Regular Bananas
---
Hydra said there was a patch with 50MB. Would be interested in knowing if they fixed issues as well
---
You have to account for 20g training
---
They fixed the water in classic too right? At first you could see through the surface like in BfA but now you can't.
---
Before I had kids I would have been disgusted.
---
Now I have kids I am impressed and inspired.
---
Yeah you're totally right about the felhunter. I thought they got spell lock much later.
---
Yeah seems so.
---
Im mostly thinking in terms of killing that i cant avoid - for example, farming Juju buffs etc.
---
Strath lvl 40? Not even lvl 50 is enough for there iirc.
---
!remindme 83 day
---
Yes you need to pick up skinning and just vendor their skins, would have DRASTICALLY cut down your time.
---
If you start grinding gorillas at 35, you'd def have mount by 40.
---
Seen these things often enough.    
---
It's only a matter of presence of an experienced wall-jumper in the match.
---
You obviously havent played Horde. UD Warrior is common. Least common on Horde is Tauren Hunter, and Troll Rogue.
---
They've already said that you can't do that. I fail to see the point of this video
---
HYPE
---
I really want to be a MT and so warrior is the obvious choice. However, I am aware that it’s very hard to get a MT spot, especially as I have never played vanilla before. I have literally no responsibilities for the next year and so will be able to no life for the foreseeable future. I don’t want to play a warrior if I’m not going to be a MT because DPS and OT don’t look very fun and I want to be the go-to guy for my guild. Is it worth risking it and levelling all the way to 60 and hoping someone will take me on or should I try and find a guild that needs a MT now? 
---
If I don’t roll warrior, I would play hunter but I’m also worried about not getting raid spots as I hear that guilds only take 1-3 hunters. I don’t feel like my no-lifing would be appreciated due to hunters only being there for tranq shot.
---
Any advice? I’m struggling :(
---
that's news to me. Can you link where they said that? im curious
---
Can I have your wife please?
---
The inflation from classic to retail is roughly 1000% percent... So 100g in classic is roughly 100000 gold on retail... However, you also need to take into account that you need this money on level 40 so by virtue off not being max level you can see that the grind is real.. Like several hours of grind four the gold.
---
Well, at least you can Sap off faction competition still!
---
And kill them after you're done gathering - priorities!
---
classicdb has no ads and no brand to push. I suspect if the author of classicdb finds that wowhead has become better than their site, they will be happy.
---
I've found a few I knew back then. But I didn't like them much so I won't be responding to their messages.
---
They are opening 8 servers per region. There's more than 8 streamers per region.
---
Yeah were got to them before they were downed and it kinda sucked the life out of our guild. Wiping on this with undergeared tanks and knowing much much better guilds than ours(Nihilum, Death and Taxes etc) hadn't even killed it yet kinda sucked the life out of our guild. TBC announcement was the nail in the coffin for us i think but this fight didn't exactly help.
---
!remindme  85 days
---
Upvote this master piece of art!
---
You are trying to read into it too much. The clear explanation is that streamers are the best possible advertisement you can get and may be acquired for completely free by inviting them into the beta. That's something many companies pay a lot of money to get, just look at how common sponsored streams / YouTube videos are.
---
I think what got us here is the hard work of all the Blizzard developers past and present who actually made the game.
---
Ty for your time and effort:)
---
it isn't. THe lighting on him is completely different to the background.
---
World pvp at 60, obviously
---
Raids in Vanilla had attunments-a series of tasks that had to be completed before you enter the raids. More tedious than anything but still added extra character to the game.
---
PvE content can vary-how familiar are people with the content and mechanics? How well are you geared? Whats the skill level of players? I've had instances where for example MC had taken 4 hours with continuous wipes on Rag because people were playing badly geared alts (and were also really bad at playing them). Then the same raid would log onto their mains next week and blaze through it no problems.
---
With having a warrior and a hunter with you you're pretty much set for dungeons- finding 2 more dps/cc classes will be a breeze. I'd suggest spending time on various dungeons, get geared and hone your skills-you can build a rep for your self and become a sought after player.
---
Moms: we have Warcraft at home...
---
When I was in middle school I was the only student in the 8th grade who didn’t go on the class trip to nyc.  I spent the day in Azeroth and sooooo worth
---
Dear god, get over your self.
---
Yeah your arguments are kinda lame. They dont make allot of sense. Im done with it. I guess I walk away and you ride off. Ofc its not the same as the ah, altough your right that it does affect the demand for gold. Raiding however is about time.. So maybe you should get real. Im done with it.. For me, you are part of the problem with Retail.
---
you make a makro 
---
/(spell?)stopcasting
---
/cast \[whatever\] and then spam it ;)
---
get an addblocker man. But yes, it's a shame that so many siteholders think it's okay to allow that kind of ads on their webpage.
---
As grueling as this fight was, and how dumb it is in that you need eight tanks, i still like the way it plays out. It's really all about perfect execution over a long time vs a lot of other fights in naxx that can be bruteforced by having shittons of DPS.
---
I'm looking for a class that is:
---
• Highly sought after by raiding guilds
---
• Has a high skill-cap
---
• Is good in Bgs, WPvP and duels (priority in that order)
---
• Is preferably underrepresented
---
If anyone knows where I can find this unicorn, please let me know.
---
This actually makes me sad that I don't have a lunchbox.......surprise food is the best food
---
Then say 'Hello' after you join their group? Honestly, if you're worried about no one saying anything, that's on you. I chatter all the time in my retail PuGs because I take the time to initiate conversations.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
I always thought it would be a no brainier for me to play warrior as it's been my main since playing classic way back. Upon reassessing the class, the slow levelling process and how much dedication I've decided it may not be the best idea considering my current work/life schedule. I don't want the guild to need to rely on me to be there when there's a chance I may not make a raid for various reasons. 
---
With that in mind I'm tossing up between rogue, mage and priest. Mage rotation seems a bit stale and being a healer falls into the same problem of guild reliance on the role. 
---
Help me Reddit!
---
Also the bug when you get dismounted half way and drop on top of your friend flying the wyvern. No two of you are flying the same wywvern.
---
there is an addon that calculates the ping time and shows kind of a "point of no return"-Bar in your actuall cast bar. if you cross the line the spell will always go of (if the ping stays roughly the same)
---
You “die hard no changes” types are so delusional as fuck.
---
Alright, it's up.
---
With no responsibilities and nolifing it, I think getting a MT spot will be fairly easy. As long as you are adept at gaming you will learn vanilla tanking no problem. Just get to 60 fast, gear up and you will be in demand. Just know, if you ever choose to leave a guild as a MT you will wreck that guild...
---
That actually looks like a terrible way to play.
---
For a second I thought you said "OMG NACHOS!"
---
No it isn’t, they got rid of it
---
It should be a toggle disable option, just like autorefuse trades and guild invites. It's super useful in the open world and especially in worldPvP.
---
"Success so clearly in view, or is it merely a trick of the light?"
---
He’s wrong, they removed the option
---
This never worked on vanilla. Don't think classic will be different. 
---
With internet being more available. Speed increases. Access at a younger age. Meme culture. Etc. I think its safe to say there are more trolls out there now compared to 15 years ago. They won't adhere to your ceasefire.
---
How to ruin the Classic hype 101
---
- Being this salty
---
I'm in the exactly same position here. Want warrior, but don't have the time, torn between rogue/hunter/priest. Would love some input.
---
I am hoping to avoid french, italian, spanish, german and russian players. Why? Because they, from my own experience, aren't very well versed in english. Haven't had any bad experiences in that these nationalities are rude or anything, just that extremely often they just don't understand english which makes playing with them very difficult.
---
In regards to time I would not go warrior, at least not if you want to tank raids. Dps will probably be fine, however leveling as a warrior will take time.
---
I haven't done the printing yet, since the maps had a few typos in them. I'll be using the V1.2 32768x24576 one. 300+ dpi is full print quality, so 32768 / 300 = up to 109 inches (\~276.5cm) by 24576 / 300 = 82 inches (\~208cm). So anything up to 300x200ish should look great.
---
Fortunately for classic now, everyone is aware that fury warriors (or druids even) will have to pick up offtank gear. We had warriors in T2 and feral in AQ gear and it was fine.
---
I got the game day one. I first found out about addons in stv. People were talking about Cosmos. 
---
So yeah sorta, but also not really. If a 15 year old finds out about addons a month or two into the game, by chatting in game, odds are guys who were my age now then, had addons by the second week.
---
I get that and i am only 29 🙃
---
I don't know what salty is. Does it have to do with streaming?
---
I have tried shield slam spec and honestly, once you are geared, you will be quite strong and will be able to farm with no problems. Hell, you ll be though even in pvp, its surprisingly strong. However it lacks dps if undergeared I believe
---
&gt;But lets say i need to farm 20 cloth for whatever fucking thing im doing, or to solo some quest etc.
---
Ask your friendly neighborhood rogue (or some other suitable class) for help. Seriously. That cloth stack (or whatever) won't cost so much that someone in your guild won't mind sharing it with you. Especially if you tank their dungeon runs/raids. Pretty sure they would also be up for helping with quest mobs.
---
Alternatively .. you can take a long time doing the killing yourself. No better advice, as I have no experience on a Warrior in Vanilla.
---
Aye, caring about streamers streaming, and having to watch them because they ain't in the beta.
---
Thats OK, lower beta activity might mean that more invites will be send out.   
---
Because if less ppl report (/are actively beta testing)  blizzard will need more people and then its time for us plebs to do our part &lt;3
---
Imagine being this mad about a thing you could just ignore
---
You seem to care way too much for someone, who wants to look like he doesn't care. 
---
So here my question: Why do you even care?
---
Bookmarked keep us updated OP
---
Came here expecting the 10hr remix of 'Live to Win'
---
Stayed for the genuine hype playlist - rock on OP!
---
It has a separate loot table
---
They housed strat and scholo, so personally I have lots of memories there. If not for that I probably wouldn’t love them as much.
---
You can cancel a flight path in 1.12.
---
&gt;Reply
---
You realise that to raid Naxx, arguably one of the hardest raids in WoW, you need to be potted and flasked up to the eyeballs. Thus, you need to grind to get the gold/mats to afford them. If you think you can just log on twice a week to raid Naxx, I got some baaaad news for you.
---
First day on the internet?
---
I really want to play classic as a priest healer. I quit during bc and think i want to start up again. Undead preist probably. I've been struggeling choosing proffessions though. I've decided to do tailoring until i have crafted the super good healing robe, then switch it out for something else. But not sure if i should switch out to hearbalism/alchemy for raiding or do engineering/enchanting.
---
Also wondering if engineering/alchemy is viable. Feedback much is appriciated.
---
To be fair I think streamers are actually creating hype, they are basically free advertising for classic
---
Because blizzard didn’t give him the beta key he so obviously deserves.
---
You cant reduce something that doesnt exist. But I allready figured there is no talking to blindsided people like you. Only delusional people could convince themselves that this feature would have any impact on gameplay at all.
---
I think he is special kid. Every day is a first day for him.
---
Some getting trolled by someone who wants attention from asmongold
---
They won't be high because nobody can afford anything at start
---
Chaos corrupts, brother.
---
There's about 2,000 people in the beta, and I'd say about 20 of those are noteworthy streamers.  How salty do you have to be to make a Reddit post targetting literally 0.01% of the beta population.
---
These people that cry about streamers, they do realize they're not obligated to watch them right???
---
Nah fam, classic is what the game was in 2006. New models didn’t exist back then and they shouldn’t be in classic now. Toggle or not. The whole point of classic is to be able to relive the game as it was then. 
---
Besides, when you could toggle old/new models in retail it kept the new animations, sounds, etc which defeated the entire purpose of switching to old models, it was scuffed.
---
When the invite wave gets reported but it’s top 3 F&amp;F list.
---
Oh, there are quite obvious "changes" from private servers. I follow kargoz and his little mob and they talk about the big differences between beta and private.
---
They side with the beta nearly in every instance, because, how could they remember that kind of content 12 years ago.
---
But things like spirit ticks, bag drops, wand damage, elite damage are huge differences apparently.
---
Gonna have to disagree. I have leveled a dagger rogue to 60 on pservers and much prefer the control I have during a fight, also I prefer the lack of damage taken during the fight, I have to stop and eat almost never. Plus the burst damage potential is insane with improved ambush, improved backstab and remorseless. It's not easy to play, sometimes a gouge miss can really fuck you, but to so say it's you cannot level effectively is just objectivlely wrong. Sword spec is easier and it might be a tiny bit faster, but fuck me is it mind numbing and boring.
---
I don't think this is true. Look at companies like supercell. They put out mobile pay to win garbage and people flock to it. Same with King. There's tons of money in pay to win garbage games, especially on mobile. King and Supercell and doing better than fine.
---
People fear beeing on a streamer server, i just hope guys like you are not on mine!
---
Simply amazing. This is the WoW Classic I was looking forward, the same Blizzard has done to Warcraft 3, a remasterization to 2019 graphics with #NoChanges on gameplay at all. Come on, you can start downvoting me now.
---
Amazing! Thank you, I really am looking forward to more paintings from  [u/MightyIceFoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/MightyIceFoe/), so in the meantime anything is welcome.
---
Lost contact with pretty much all of them except for IRL friends that happened to play at the time. Haven't played retail solidly in the past 7 years perhaps. When I played vanilla, I was like 17 and was still in school and had no real commitments so had a lot of cool people to play with. Sadly with the advent of LFR, cross realm play, etc. The social aspect pretty much died.
---
Yepp, a person who thinks doing dungeons is not "testing a game" if you are overgeared would be great asset for Blizzard to test their game. He is a genius of the generation.
---
Wich requires the team to communicate his position after using the mind vision, promoting teamwork, with 80 yard nameplates you can just wallhack everyone.
---
YEAHHHHHH!!!!
---
Wow is a direct comparison to RuneScape. RuneScape likely has more current active players than wow
---
Heres your answer
---
If you stay with the level curb at release you'll do fine. If you fall behind other people leveling, youre gonna have a bad time assuming youre on a pvp server. At lvl 60 you scale way higher than any other class. 
---
That said, most warriors wont make it to 60 because leveling a warrior is mentally exhausting.
---
Oh god the fucking horror.
---
People play BFA, well no shit haha. 
---
/r/IAmVerySmart
---
Imagine being either fifteen years old and writing this post, or being a grown-ass adult who played Vanilla and writing this post pretending to be a new player.
---
I don't know which one is worse.
---
&gt; Can't you say the same about meme specs in PvE that do no dmg and nobody wants to raid with? Or specs that are less favored in BG's and nobody wants in their premade?
---
A player can respec relatively easily, so their leveling effort isn't wasted if they're willing to adapt.  And every PvP guild will need at least one of every class for premades.
---
That's a very different situation than (for example) a Paladin that has absolutely no chance of beating an equal-skill Rogue/Mage/Priest, no matter how they spec or what classes they group with.
---
Basically, the more that large group efforts are promoted, the less that individual class imbalance matters (especially when each class can bring something essential to their group/raid/premade).  But when small group content is important, class imbalance becomes much more impactful... which then results in more and more calls for perfect balance, and results in normalization and blandness.
---
&gt; Why do you even care?
---
I care about Vanilla but this stream culture is terrible.
---
if you go Horde, you may rediscover the game and not do things that you have already done X times. That could be a pro for going Horde :)
---
• Highly sought after by raiding guilds  
---
Warlocks, healers and tanks  
---
• Has a high skill-cap  
---
Warlocks, healers arguably.  
---
• Is good in Bgs, WPvP and duels (priority in that order)   
---
Warlocks, all healers (and their offspecs (elem/feral/shadow/ret))  
---
• Is preferably underrepresented  
---
Warlocks, all healers.
---
I’m going with option 3, a new expansion that hasn’t been made before, that follows the spirit of classic
---
Keep 40 raids, keep it in Azeroth, no flying mounts, stuff like that
---
Im considering doing the opposite
---
Roll alliance, quest in darkshore of course.
---
I am in the exact same situation minus that I will be probably Alliance, since most of my friends want to play there. Dwarf time :(
---
Most of the people say that it's a waste to level up tailoring early, but I believe it can be both fun and rewarding to craft a decent set + the BiS robe. My plan is to level tailoring + skinning at least til 60 and then I will be in the exact same situation as you. 
---
If I am ahead of the curve and the mats to level engineering are relatively cheap, I will just go tailoring + engineering (farming gold and buying off AH mats).
---
Having the Mooncloth CD can be a steady way of getting gold, so maybe I end up keeping tailoring.
---
Let see what others say!
---
hmm you might be on to something here
---
I can ignore streamers, and I do. I have nothing against them in person but this streamer movement and culture is poisoning everything everywhere.
---
Any particular reason why you decides to ignore the last sentence of my post?
---
!Remind me 80 days
---
I just like the old models more because they look ridiculous. I love the dwarf with the chin beard. I love the human with it's sausage like arms and hexagon eyes. Those are things I tend to remember and ridicule. Look at the Human Model right now in retail; when you select a beard you're basically Socrates with a clump of play-doh attached to your chin. Way too cartoony for me.
---
Why the fuck would they allow this? Even a monkey knows that they will never allow this.
---
There is the chance to completly ignore it and still enjoy the oncoming game - don't you think?
---
Did you both consider Warlock? It provides a lot of value (more than hunter), easy to level and your guild will be happy when you are around, but you are not mandatory.
---
you wont not want to go back to work
---
your post history is very negative. are you doing ok?
---
Wow, sounds amazing
---
Would be cool and all, but it's just unrealistic. Too many art assets to completely redo. It would take them so long and in the end it probably wouldn't even bring them anymore significant income.
---
The cost would be enormous. I highly doubt it would be even close to breaking even let alone profitable.
---
What do you mean by that? Like they are bugged?
---
Thanks, i will!
---
And I agree with you.
---
I am playing an undead rogue and I couldn't be happier
---
massive clickbait trash
---
I'd hate to see the buildings and their interiors losing their charming aesthetics so until they are recreated as faithfully as the boat for example, no. Once that's done and such lovely curved buildings await in the new open wilderness, HELL YEA!
---
I had one in TBC and one time i fought two alliance hunters at their graveyard in arathi and killed them with just a few percent health left.  
---
They almost immediately respawn next to me and i right klick the first one and oneshot him with WF proc and then i do the same with the second one.  
---
This is till today my most memorable pvp moment.  
---
And then i had my lvl 49 Human warlock in TBC.  
---
With BiS gear for that level which includes the jewelcrafting trinket that gives u 100 or something spellpower at use.  
---
This twink was just insane and if you dotted enough people you were almost unkillable if you were not up against other pvp twinks with very good gear.
---
It's invalid. To raid Naxx realistically, you need to be a hardcore player. Casual players will probably never (successfully anwyay) raid Naxx. You need to be dedicated and have the time to pour into the game. A 15 hour player a week won't be able to raid it, in my opinion. And the time spent grinding and preparing will eat well into that 15 hours.
---
This, I waited for Emerald Dream for years and got Pandas and content recycling. There is so much potential there.
---
In addition to that, content that is almost in the game: Karazan, Caverns of Time (obviously item drops would need to be redesigned from scratch).
---
I think the proper explanation is, that these dungeons are really easy compared to what people are used to. 30 bis gear helps, but everyone is overestimating the differences between bis and normal quest/dungeon equip you obtain normally.
---
If I find a guild nice enough to take a chance on me, I’m in it for the long run!
---
You're an idiot.
---
Wicked, thanks
---
WOKE
---
I use AB+ and half the shit still gets through and runs slower.
---
if it's anything like the stress test, good luck!
---
[*wrong answer buzzer sound*](https://youtu.be/J_4YwvfEls4?t=480)
---
I think I will be doing the same
---
 I'm not very keen the warlock playstyle since it doesn't have a lot of mobility and the PvE scene is spamming SB. And in the pvp scene it's very gear dependant! Plus the shard-farming.
---
Streaming is making people more hyped for the game.
---
Even if you don't personally like them it is good overall.  More people playing means more money that Blizzard makes which means they will support classic more.  
---
The more popular classic is the better chance we have to get post naxx content or BC servers.
---
Ohh thanks for the link bro yeah its been a while since i looked all that stuff up lol
---
Dungeons were super easy in Vanilla too if your group had good gear.  But even early on in a popular game like WoW you had to take what you could get, so your group would consist of a hunter in +spirit gear, a rogue without the sap talents, an Elemental Shaman in place of a healer, and a tank that was 6 levels below the final boss.
---
Druid sounds like a potentially good pick. With shapeshifting you have many tools at your disposal, and they kick ass in WSG as best flag carriers. It comes down to how you feel healing in raids.
---
Nyce
---
Just don’t watch streams... problem solved!  This is the exact thing I do and I feel absolutely no hate, or anything at all for that matter towards streamers.  They have zero impact on me. 
---
This is a problem you’re creating for yourself.
---
Does that command work on private servers then?
---
As of the mod that finds you a group it seems to be nicely thought so I take that back even if my nostalgia will make me spam lfg in the city chat :P
---
The thing is that I find add-ons to be a bad implementation from blizzards part. You have to go and find the best ones in the internet, and in old times you had to do some hacker things to be able to activate them(I don't know if it has been streamlined). And if they are so crucial to the game that means blizzard did a bad job giving the options to be the best you can from the get go. And then you have the experience part that with add-ons is a bit diminished, you have an add on that tells you the rotation, you have an add on that shows you the attack timer, you have an add on that show you where to move in a raid, when the boss will attack and more. I just find that it takes some of the fun of the game. 
---
Well it all comes down to what you expect from a game I guess. I'm also competitive but I don't want something to show me how good I am I want to be able to understand my progression from the game and not from dmg meters. I want to know from experience how to play and not from add-ons. For me these add-ons take away from the excitement of the game and it makes it more like work, you do stuff that add-ons show you. 
---
Anyways I understand where you come from and I guess most of the players think like you. So I respect that.
---
Im not saying that it is the norm for people like that to clear naxx. But i certainly think its possible if that id your goal and you plan your gaming sessions accordingly
---
&gt;There's about 2,000 people in the beta
---
That's it?  Damn.  Now I don't feel as bad for not getting an invite.
---
being selected for stress test 1 (and subsequently 1.5) doesn't ensure access to 2 and 3. there's a reflag process for each test. at least now people will know if they got beta access or not instead of logging in every 10 minutes only to be disconnected or presented with an offline stress test server
---
The cup is for Jurassic World which came out in 2015
---
I have used the Internet since 1994 but I prefer not to take part of various online cultures. But I get it now. Salt is tasting bitter so in this culture people use that word.
---
If they ever did a remaster or remake of it, I've always thought they would end up going the route of how Overwatch's graphics are. 
---
But then you see WC3:Reforged and you think maybe they would take  it that way instead which is more like HOTS so I dunno about that...
---
Thanks for the answer! I'll just go with a hunter and since I'm sure I'll have an alt at some point, I can just switch to that if I stop enjoying my hunter.
---
With you on unit frames though I never use them.
---
you'll never get a real answer. he never thought that far into it.
---
Imagine being this mad about a thing you could just ignore.
---
Not a chance, bud. I think retail has clouded peoples expectations and forget how time consuming/difficult that Vanilla WoW was. Hell, threat hasn't been an issue now for like 5 expansions.
---
&gt; id love to see thoughtful changes or additions to some classic servers
---
Isn't this what they did with the expansions? I'm sure they thought the additions and changes over the last decade were 'thoughtful' to them. we don't want that.
---
wowprogramming/wowwiki is outdated, most people nowadays uses [wowpedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Getting_started_with_writing_addons) instead. They have API diffs for both classic and retail.
---
My answer to you is:
---
You seem to care way too much for someone, who wants to look like he doesn't care.
---
there are still PLENTY of people on who aren't streamers, aren't following them all around, doing the leveling in various ways and still reporting lots of bugs.
---
an escort quest doesn't need to be test by thousands of people to see if it's broken. (for your example).
---
not true actually. any quests related to phasing (such as BWL attunment, AQ lead-up quests etc.. will not be accessed because the content technically isn't out) the devs said this in one of their media Q&amp;As
---
I wanna know why they ever removed this from the current game even, like.. it adds so much more *life* into it
---
I feel the same about EverQuest's graphics, and I didn't even grow up with EverQuest. My first play through ended up being in a progression server. Most people would look at the graphics and go "lol wtf is this garbage" but the amount of charm and authenticity in the graphics is something I've never seen in an MMO before. It was still an immersive experience despite the 1999 graphics.
---
2006 called and they want their computer, keyboard, mouse, and tv back.
---
If you're on a server with streamers chances are people looking to gank will be after them, not you. Bring up streamers as a reason "the game is ruined" is just you grasping at straws.
---
Then I envy him lol
---
Probably just sword and shield.  Let’s you use revenge and shield slam which are decent damage.  Of course it’s not as good as just being fury or arms, but might as well take advantage of what you have as Prot. 
---
A weapon change macro may be of use... not sure if it’s worth all the trouble tho.
---
The closer to classic the better,  If you want retail QOL options maybe classic isn't right for you.
---
Boring, next.
---
Old models look better.
---
Could always try to be an off-tank.  Focus primarily on Arms, build your prot set in your spare time.
---
Plenty of fights require 3 tanks, and if you can't make it, it's not too hard to find a solution for those fights and a DPS is always easy to find.
---
Nothing is worse than a shaman using rockbiter and frost shock in a dungeon (with lightning shield go boot) and then saying “L2 keep threat warrior”
---
Why would I pay to test their game? Blizzard dont "give" anyone a key, they let you buy it, I have no idea why anyone would PAY to test a beta...
---
That would be too kool for this world, we’re not ready for it’s perfection
---
Tbh even though I don't RP thise servers are great. Cuties feel way more alive when a bunch of players are acting like NPCs
---
Starting zones will be *very* busy.  Be prepared to group up with strangers so you can get credit for kill quests.
---
A N AL K i I I
---
I was also thinking about utility, because tranq shot isn't as useful lator on. But I don't plan on pushing server firsts or anything, so you're right. Thanks!
---
tbf, it serves the same purpose as a wipe if you pump out fresh servers that make the old ones obsolete.
---
Leveled a rogue in Vanilla/TBC, but going to be going Mage as my main (and am better at) as I played 60 mages on both the popular pservers and got really experienced with the class. I love druid though, and want to have a druid alt because i love their hybrid capabilities and the class is really fun. The highest i've leveled a druid was around 48, but technically really only around 30 during Vanilla/TBC as those last levels were in wrath/cata. Love Paladin too, leveled one to 40 in a pserver, but as full on ret with holy consecration because it was possible to tank...The problem is that I don't like healing and those classes are pretty much destined for healing in end-game raiding. I dont mind a pally healing, I guess :/, but druid? I love bear and cat form and would love to do a feral/resto build where i can get utility out of both trees, which i read was possible. Can i be feral and also heal effectively? Like 30 in feral 21 in resto or something?
---
Not really except for the graphics maybe.
---
for daggers the most common is this one I think  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R)
---
Back in the day 21/8/22 was the "cookie-cutter" do-everything spec. You really want the 21 points in assassination for Cold Blood
---
Germans dont understand english? LOL  
---
You´ve must been playing with 12y olds...
---
He stole my mount!
---
I expect a total shit show and dont expect a ton of progress
---
I ll get 2 weeks till start of September. Goodbye family and friends
---
I am looking into a few FedEx runs a.k.a exploration and very limited question that can get me to level 10. Depending on the business this might prove useful. Other than that the plan is to play from launch until I reach 15, I won't go to sleep before that.
---
i gave my kids tablets when they each turned 6 months. at 1 year i got them used to using a keyboard and a mouse. now my 3 and 5 year old are self sufficient at using computers. in a few months, they'll be gold farmers. time to contribute to the house, kiddos.
---
I agree that its free advertising. Sure. But you know, who is getting hyped over watching streamers faceroll vanilla dungeons?
---
This made me think if something has been tested. 
---
Has anyone tested to see if you can see people flying over the areas while they're on a flight path? E.g like if someone was at that lake, can he see the person fly by &amp; vice versa? 
---
On top of that, can two people flying at roughly the same time to the same area see and talk to each other in /say ?
---
I'd imagine the latter should still work cause I think I remember it in BFA at some point, but not sure on the first since it could possibly phase you while on a flight for all we know. I could imagine it being overlooked when back porting.
---
When you’ve just been playing on private servers instead of waiting for the beta
---
I disagree. I am well aware. I raided hardcore in vanilla and BC. Farming for consumables was a pain in the ass until it got changed pretty early on in BC. With what i know now and also from private servers, i can farm everything that much more efficiently than i did back in the day. Not to mention that when naxx comes out you can have saved up tons of gold to buy your shit. Worst case scenario he could always do what i do. I have 2 accounts and have always 2 clients open. The amount of money i farm on my second account while i am traveling on my main account (where i would be on my desktop anyway,not doing anything productive in wow) is no joke either. If there is a will there is a way.
---
You made one mistake into two.
---
Just because it's a PvE relm doesn't mean there wont be people flagged for PvP. Also think about when you gotta do class quest and attunements. It becomes just more of an annoyance imo.
---
Calm down satan
---
Noice
---
The problem creating new content is that everyone is going to want something different.
---
Most of the people playing classic would want more content that they could do.  The audience clearing naxx would be a very small part of the classic population so spending development time on something harder and after naxx is doubtful. 
---
So do they make more 5 man content ?  Another 20 man raid set between aq40 and naxx ?  More PVP content ?
---
Once you start making tons of changes it isn't really classic anymore.  I think the best idea would be to release BC servers for people that want to play that and have fresh classic servers launch periodically so people can start at the beginning again and again.
---
Downvote this post and move on guys
---
I never said it was better but it is useful atleast a bit *shrug*
---
Wow! Is your wife single?
---
Exploring an unknown world is what classic is all about, you're lucky you don't know everything there is to know about this game. So many adventures await you.
---
Blizzard should be thanking ppl like Asmongold for doing actual stress testing with the crowd he pulls in and the events he leads
---
At least you see that your arguments aren’t sound and that you’re better off just crawling back under whatever rock you can find.
---
Imagine being so salty that you mistake sarcasm for salt.
---
Elemental Shaman
---
get ublock origin
---
Regardless of what new content they push out it'll be a dissapointment. The development mentality simply isn't there plus the fact that the classic community is incredibly split on what "they" want.
---
So you are telling me this is the 2019 version of gold farmers?
---
This isn’t a deviation though, right? This is how they were in Vanilla.
---
Could also be nightfall, but the tank has the draconian defender eqiuped?!?!?! Can't be a 2h!
---
once you get windfury that's all you use. if you want to snare someone in pvp use frost shock
---
Are warlocks really that sought after in terms of pve spots on alliance?
---
A couple developers are not the ones that will be making this decision. Until there’s Blue text from a CM saying “X will not happen”, it could very well happen.
---
i get tha - wait I dont have a wife
---
feelsbadman
---
Darkshore is one of the best zones. Not an opinion either. I think all alliance guides use it because of how dense the quests are.
---
I wouldn't say leveling on a PvP server is any harder. I played on a PvP server during all of wotlk. You just are BLOCKED off from leveling at some points. You NEVER have to fight off another player taking your spawns etc. You only ever are ganked by someone who one hits you and camps your body
---
I am amazed that people are willing to pay to playtest a beta. And thankful because I dont want to do that.
---
Incorrect, its because tears are salty.
---
But arent they the baddies in the lore tho? They did invade Azeroth right? Might be wrong on that tho.
---
did someone said...
---
Haha guys this was all sarcasm from the beginning, gotcha :) :) :)
---
You played 60 mages? That's one hell of an effort.
---
Least played class, High skill-cap and lots of fun to play in all areas of PvP. But unfortunately, they are not highly sought after by raiding guilds.
---
Hey bud, you ever heard of the idea that if you run into someone being an asshole, they were an asshole, but if you run into assholes all day, you’re the asshole?
---
You’re the one who is mad, it’s very clear.
---
90% of all games you bought in the last 5years, are payed tests. Because there unfinished and rushed to release....*caught* fallout 76, anthem*cought*
---
Enjoy classic at it is and dont watch streams if you dont like streamers or streaming in general because of the modern culture
---
Huh. I'm not actually sure which one I use on my pc, but when I load it up in ms edge I get one ad and no pings from antivirus. it doesn't run slow at all for me.
---
It is a tradeoff between having minimal impact on community and wpvp *for the first couple of months only*, and having very active/healthy/populated servers.
---
While also having the secondary advantage of mitigating queues and server slowdowns/crashes.
---
Personally (with the caveat of it not being permanent), I feel like if you don't think it's a better overall solution to just having tons of servers, you don't really understand how it works.
---
i just logged in to the beta opt in [battle.net](https://battle.net) page for the first time in a few weeks and lo and behold i see an option to select "world of warcraft classic" check box that i swear wasn't there before. i thought it was just bundled under the regular wow beta one. did i just overlook this from the start?
---
Didn't you know? It's 1:1
---
This is actually case of the flight paths going back to a Vanilla state. Originally flight paths were animated manually by a designer. As we got the option to chain together multiple paths to reach a distant destination, \*and\* be able to get off a chain at the next stop if we needed to get off early for some reason, we lost a lot of those animations. They all became rather basic.
---
I dont get it
---
why is classic shattered?
---
Me irl
---
Sounds like they don't want you to roll warrior as opposed to the other way around.
---
I think I like that bleakness.  There's something more serious, a bit more scary about those zones that makes it more immersive.
---
But #NoChanges!!
---
Gorgeous looking, always loved the UE revamped zones some of these people make... Grizzly hills was a God send if you haven't seen that one.
---
Nah, thats definitely an opinion. You're not wrong about the fact that quests are close together, but calling it "the best zone" is opinionated.
---
Also alliance is garbage tier. Horde is where you wanna be.
---
Speaking from personal experience (every expansion launch, multiple realm first leveling achievements): the vast majority of people don't push for 24h+ or stay up past 2-3AM.
---
It's a given that it'll be a mess, but once you're finally out of the initial bottlenecks it should be a somewhat smooth sailing. It mostly depends on what you want your experience to be like, but if your goal is to get ahead of the curve I'm certain you'll be able to within the first 24 hours.
---
I will have my bank toon right at launch with Enchanting/Tailoring. 
---
My shaman will be my main so I’ll need to have Alchemy and Herbalism, for consumables. They’re needed badly on shaman.
---
Really random story but this reminded me of it and now its bugging me. Back in 2004 I was at a pc cafe and new to WoW. This dude was skateboarding outside and occasionally checking up on what I thought was a release timer and I was wondering why he didnt just release and run back. Now Im wondering if it was actually a res timer.
---
The rush to get in as the Classic servers goes up for the first time will never be replicated again, even if they add new servers it won't be special any more. 
---
Even if it's a complete shit show you'd better believe I'm sitting there from 11pm to 11pm the next day.
---
:X
---
I mean they could have a look on my post history, but to much work I guess.
---
I've never tried it personally. 
---
I imagine it's the same situation as what I mentioned for this post. If they copied any version of the old code directly it should exist, If they made it from scratch it's such a niche/pointless thing that they may not know about it, or bother spending dev time on it.
---
The best zone for that level range. Happy now? Efficiency and experience wise.
---
maybe he means that it's being put back together piece by piece, dunno lol :D
---
Man, you must hate every whippersnapper that uses slang.
---
Oh, dang, I used slang, sorry.
---
Don't focus so much on class.  Even the hardcore guilds will take a 8k DPS Hunter over a 7k DPS Rogue.
---
I love how C'thun was killed by a paladin with that laser. 
---
With eye for an eye, every spell crit on the paladin, reflected 30% of the damage back on the caster.
---
Streamers have exactly zero affect on anything.
---
I think I read somewhere in the form of "Nothing will be interchangeable between wow and classic wow"
---
RuneScape?
---
Burnout for streamers is actually quite a real thing, anyone can get burnt out on something if you do it long enough. The fact they draw a paycheck from it can make the burnout feel worse since then it turns into forcing themselves through it.
---
We* are the 99%
---
Incorrect, its because I will put my foot up your ass.
---
Yes, I think it may have been more that the cancel feature is what cause the generic animations to come in, though I consider the cancel feature necessary because of course you can chain together flights.
---
No. You're alliance filth. I wont be happy until your dead.
---
Yes you are.
---
It's really incredible how beautiful this game actually is.
---
You’ve misread. He said 60 mages on both servers. So that’s 120 mages? 😂😂😂
---
&gt;I was just pretending to be retarded, always have
---
Thank's boss, I'll give it a try.
---
If you are 19 you should be able to do your own laundry
---
Poopy brake
---
Hmm good to know, I probably just downloaded the worst Adblocker, just figured it was all of the adblockers with all the post online you see about their intrusive ads.
---
Imagine being so salty that you comment salty topics with salt.
---
Right. You’re just mad you don’t have a good zone like that. In your defense, we don’t really have swamp of sorrows or stonetalon.
---
Mage kills 3 half HP low levels that were clueless incoming pvp.
---
I know a ton which are coming back, devs ain’t prepared(bad launch)
---
Probably herp derp layering bad derp herp
---
Sharding perhaps?
---
Sharding?
---
I love the WOW minimap clock.
---
Main reason being that I keep it at server time and NOT local time so it's an hour fast.
---
I always get an hours extra gaming when I look at it.
---
Not sure what the strafe animation issue was, but here is what it looks like as of this morning:  https://imgur.com/h7zMplo
---
Imagine replying to the same comment for the third time
---
Mama Planet comes first!
---
Yes that was meant for using mouse buttons, all my pvp abilities are on 1-12 and shift(pinky) 1-12
---
I'm from the UK, so think it'll be a bit odd. While I think there will be a lot of players online starting at 11pm, it wont be as busy as it could be. Folk with Jobs (who dont have days off) will not be playing long. kids with school or even uni/college might struggle too.    
---
I'm not going to fret it too much, I'll log in and play for a few hours too, and see whats happening. If it is totally unplayable, then I'll give it a miss or just go find a grinding spot and come back to the quests later.
---
Should definitely go to Rogues first, to be fair.
---
Did you notice if stealth animations got fixed yet? Made a post about it around the same time as this one.
---
Let me guess, private servers guessed the quests wrong?
---
Hmmm can't wait...
---
- Will 100% be queues to log in
---
- probably authentication issues for an hour or two 
---
- each layer is supposed to be close to a vanilla server pop, an entire pop to fit in 6 starting zones
---
- people will 100% get to level 5 and start botting / farming resources 
---
- if someone tries to quest solo in the starting zones, good luck
---
- depending on how far back I get (due to log in issues) I'll most likely just try to quest for 6 hours and then log off while being level 5 :)
---
I see how this could really top the charts early on.
---
Yes please!
---
I care about streamers as much as I care about a fart in a crowded elevator. I just want to get out but the doors are closed. I try to hold my nose but that just means the feces particles will go in mouth. There is no hiding from these feces streamers.
---
This is actually really generic and has no soul at all. Glad WoW will never go this route.
---
Wooord. Thank you!! I'll soak up every bit of info I can.
---
Barrens is a really good zone that connects you to go into ashenvale or 1k.
---
Alternatively you could swing the undead route of silverpine -&gt; hillsbrad -&gt; arathi -&gt; hinterlands
---
Which all are really good looking zones and have pretty interesting stories.
---
Goodluck wearing boots while treading all that salt water
---
This hurts my insidy parts.
---
^^ this
---
hello fellow wsb autist
---
Why do you care? This has literally nothing to do with Classic WoW
---
Engineering is the only profession you need, and it's for PvP. 2nd proffession is purely for making money, so engineering/anything is fine
---
&gt; Imagine replying to the same comment for the third time
---
HA HA that litterally was your third comment in this thread.
---
I win you lose.
---
Lazy dungeon layouts
---
Catchup gear
---
Daily quests
---
Space travel and sci fi
---
Reduced raid sizes
---
FLYING - killing world pvp, enabling you to fly past all the danger straight to the quest objective and so on
---
Heavy gold inflation (I made 1k gold while leveling my first toon. 1k. I wasn't poor at the end of classic but 1k gold was still a lot to anyone who didn't play the AH or sell raid gear)
---
Arenas with no comparable rewards for BGs, killing BGs
---
Removal of R14 in favour of Arena rating
---
Resilience - killing casual PvP
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
There are probably others. There are probably some you think were good changes (personally I think reducing raid size may have been the right move ultimately. 40 mans are epic but they're also a fucking bitch to manage. I also strongly dislike the R14 system).
---
But a lot of stuff changed. 
---
I personally really dislike the lazy dungeon layout (not necessarily design) of TBC. They're all effectively tubes. Blizzard has not given us a proper cool dungeon like BRD or Strath since classic I think and this started in TBC obviously, where every dungeon was one straight forward path. No forks, no wings, just "walk along this tube and kill the 3 enemies on the way".
---
The PvP changes sucked ass for me as well. I strongly prefer the strategical level of BGs vs the "blow someone up as quick as possible, win game" mentality of Arenas. With how resilience worked, it was impossible to have any fun in PvP without wearing arena gear. Jump into an AV with your fresh alt and you do NOTHING while getting OBLITERATED by a full resilience enemy's wet fart. 0 fun.
---
And I just hated TBC visually. You go through the Dark Portal and enter Hellfire Peninsula, the ugliest zone in WoW. Zangarmarsh was okay but all the water made the zone kinda ass to navigate and you only really went there to dive to the dungeon/raid hub. Blade's Edge is barren/ugly, Netherstorm looks like it belongs in another game and so do all it's dungeons. Shadowmoon Valley is depressing, which is very fitting but considering the rest of the zones, at this point, I'd rather have something nice. Nagrand obviously a beautiful zone for the time but all other Zones were just garbage ugly, depressing, gloomy or ripped straight from a sci-fi game.
---
As much as I liked the gameplay (class viability, heroic dungeons, raids), the design really took a hit and PvP all but died for me with flying, arena and resilience
---
Read a book, play a game, rollerskate.
---
3 options right there to do instead of watching streamers.
---
I has no dirty deeds, don't you use CS too sometimes as ambush bs spec?
---
I don't have a clip but well basically the leak is true and obviously tipsout and his streamer friends don't want people to ask too much into it. I hardly see the confusing part.
---
Yes it was a thing
---
r/ woooosh
---
Can’t recall my poor Pat, I don’t believe I made it very far. For some reason all my alts were alliance and both of my 60s were alliance. The zones just seem to make more sense to me
---
I do remember rolling touring though, and hunting Kodos. That bag was pretty interesting early game for leatherworkers.
---
Eww light mode. Gross.
---
Yeah. It's also pretty badass to buzz other players fighting below you.
---
Mb i tought you said something like : "only streamers got access". Didn't know the expression "burn yourself out".
---
 !remindme 81 days
---
So who’s forcing you to watch twitch/clips? Seems like a you problem.
---
Dirty deeds is quite good, CS is nice at early game for cheesing with oneshots. As for your weapon question, no your offhand doesn't have to be a dagger, but you want a very fast weapon in offhand to proc poisons, and well duh that's usually a dagger. For your mainhand you want a slow AF dagger, so something like 1.7-2.0 speed.
---
I will agree with one thing you said. 
---
Seeing how easy they are blitzing through dungeons like it’s retail is making me much less interested in Classic.
---
They don't have a plan (publicly)
---
My ideal scenario would be for them to add seasons (fresh servers with different buffs, similar to diablo) or for them to add content from either a. Any expansion or b. Brand new. 
---
The important part about them adding anything is that they don't increase the level cap ever.
---
Keep classic, vanilla.
---
Shaman. Easiest class to get a raiding guild with. High skill cap in PvP (not high skill cap in raids though, you just keep up totems and spam chain heal). Great in BGs, wPvP and duels as Elemental/Resto hybrid. Underrepresented? Not really.
---
From what the lead dev's have been saying, they are open to the idea of releasing a TBC server but changing certain aspects to align with the classic wow vibe and philosophy..... it honestly sounds to me if this is a success they are just going to do what OSRS did and remake their game.
---
so unicorns ARE real
---
It would be to buy a wow token for game time. 
---
Player A only plays classic. Has gold. Wants token. Finds player B.
---
Player B has gold on retail. Wants gold on classic. Finds player A.
---
Player A gives player B gold on classic.
---
Player B gives player A gold on retail.
---
Player A buys wow token.
---
No, What's the mage...
---
Aaahhh. That explains it perfectly for me. I appreciate all of that information. What hit% should I aim for? If I get all the gear I want, pre-MC/ZG, I should be at 15 or 16% excluding Weapons(no hit on those) and I think one of my trinkets(Hand of Justice). If I can get an Ironfoe + Felstriker + Hand of Justice though.. it'll be sick! Early dreams &lt;3
---
No worries on bring a guildbro. I did it in the past, and I'll do it again. I used to farm for a couple hours a day and bring a ton of potions to each raid for peeps. Usually fire resist so others didn't have to worry about it, but sometimes other more substantial buffs. I loved providing that service for them.
---
Im so jealous ughhh:/ gz tho!
---
That meme will be dead by then
---
Is Asmongold that bodybuilder in banagear or the female with breasts or that skinny guy who always looks angry?
---
You can't raid without threat meter and at least deadly boss mods
---
First time I’m looking forward to my
---
 Birthday :)
---
The game was fun and it had such a good soundtrack. The Warhammer universe is much more mature than the warcraft one and it has a "raw" feel to it. Maybe it was a bit like WoW back in the day, but tbh, WoW copied from older MMORPGs too. There is no shame in that.
---
I'm mainly thinking of Mage, perhaps Warlock. I like their class fantasy. I'm not totally sure which of those I want though. Mages seem to be the class that just works better; it has multiple interesting specs for PvP; you're a bit more restricted when raiding because of damage types in raids but still the class just works. No frustrating debuff limit issues, no soulstone farming, and quite straightforward. Warlock seem to have the nice toys though when it comes to demons. A pet tank seems very nice to me while leveling, but I'm not sure how it weighs up against the advantages of mages. I'm mostly worried about having to do frustrating soulstone farming and shit like that.
---
Close if you zoom in it says the lost world. The 1997 release.
---
Did u quote yourself?
---
Even back then I never understood why everyone had this awful buff list on the right which took way more space away then the original one from Blizz... :D
---
Is there a class with a spec that would allow me to heal dungeons as well as farm efficiently? I've played priest since wotlk but without dual spec, I'm worried that I won't be able to do anything besides healing and I don't want to respec very often. Is it possible to heal 5m in shadow spec or should I consider druid? I don't plan to do any progression raids
---
Back then it was bliss, now my back hurts looking at it.
---
I expect a full come-back with Classic... I cannot wait to see all that gorgeous Art! Especially with the art communities thriving and being more connected than ever compared to 2004-2006.
---
Yeah I don’t really get it. Seems weird man.
---
They’d make a TBC Server without flying mounts?!
---
&gt;there still will be DM/Songflower/ZG
---
Combo would have to be flawless to beat a dwarf hunter as rogue.
---
Hello sir. Ignoring streamers in this Classic community is like ignoring a fart in a crowded elevator.
---
Wow, Westfall looks amazing with the updated grass.
---
What about hemo isnt it superior to the others?
---
if you are going eng/enchanting, wouldnt it be wise to take mining and gather lots of ore for leveling eng once you get to 60? 
---
Nobody will be buying Enchanting mats initially, maybe not even for the first 2-3 mths. Most folk will be leveling their mains and saving for their own mounts &amp; epic mounts at 60.  Only once epic mounts are out of the way, will folk be gathering surplus gold to power-level other professions. 
---
I want to take enchanting too, on my hunter (if I can choose between hunter and shammy). But think if I do, I'll take skinning and mining/herbing till I get to 60.
---
Dude classic is so hard people can't just kill the bosses, it's new mechanics and they're really hard mechanics, at that. Getting 40 players to stay logged in and buff is the easy part!
---
They had both but the PvE server came long after the PvP one!
---
Don't forget your other blue items in Ashenvale by doing the quests!  It's about the same time.  That and the quest for RFK for blue shoulders.  :)
---
I honestly can't wait to heal Gnomer at that level again.  My only wish is that the original amount of dwarves on that ramp were brought back.  THEN teaching folks timing and movement is your 'friend' if you wanna stay alive.  :)
---
Hey, I'm not knocking a video just because it's made by someone who doesn't have a million subscribers. I'm not trying to flame you, either. I was just stating my opinion: whether someone grinded the gold for themselves, or traded with someone in BFA to get it, it still came into existence the same way. That's why it doesn't bother me, personally.
---
I'm in the same boat, tried to do a test run in retail but idk
---
I will get to you in a sec, hold on please.
---
Play a holy nuke priest. Points in smite, wands etc...
---
You will be pretty fine in 5, even in MC and you'll farm efficiently. Healing as shadow is kinda hard, mana problems. But gear could resolve this issue, gear you wont have if you dont raid though.
---
The amount of people interested in boring lives of strangers just recording their game sessions never ceases to amaze me.
---
Look dude I hate streamers too, they are great for some games and genres and do more harm than good to others. But they aren’t going anywhere. There’s to much money to be made and where’s there’s money to be made no moral or social obligation will ever trump the almighty dollar. Look even when the very existence of our species is put on the line the dollar still comes out on top.
---
&gt; King and Supercell and doing better than fine.
---
They are. Yet, to their owners, they are still not doing good enough. Fine isn't good enough anymore. It has to be all the money or you'll eventually get shut down. The industry has a really fucked up relationship with money right now.
---
Except  that I don't people to look at my character with new models on, I want to force people looking at me with old models.
---
I’m pretty sure spell lock comes at 36 so they’ll have it at 40
---
I like your reasoning. A friend told me to think of levelling as part of the experience and not a chore as well and I think he's absolutely right. Warrior life.
---
mining is garbage for gold and takes forever to level. Herbalism can give some gold and is easy to level. 
---
At 60 however the usefulness can change. One of the most common moneymakers for rogues is to pickpocket either RFD or BRD. Brd being a bit more risky but better gold. BRD has some dark iron veins you can kill mobs and mine, really nice. RFD has some herbs you can pick, okayish. In terms of making gold in the world just looking, herbalism is far superior.
---
Priest,pala or shaman? What is easy to play in pve and what will be most wanted?
---
Some friends and I are making a NA guild that will be hell bent on rampaging through STV and Tanaris. Let me know if you'd be interested.
---
"I'm taking three months vacation in September."
---
"What?  Where are you going?  For what?"
---
"To Azeroth."
---
"Where?  ...is that one of your fucking nerd games...?"
---
"...Yes..."
---
"Jesus.  You are such a nerd."
---
She still makes my lunch though.
---
valid points - but theres honestly no need to be a complete dick about it. thanks for your input none the less.
---
is this a hotfix for beta then?
---
thanks for this :)
---
I’d bet they would still have flying mounts. However it would be a huge achievement to get one of these. Similar to the same feel getting enough gold for your epic mount in vanilla was.
---
Forgetting druid who get dire bear form at 40, huge upgrade to all existing gear. Warriors will struggle to get a full set of plate quickly
---
I kind of said that, there will be phases which act like patches.
---
I thought it was clear that way :P
---
It's not the worst idea, having portals and pvp fun makes up for the shortcomings in pve.
---
Every time I concider playing a Mage I see all these pros. They have great DPS in all stages of Classic, they have water and portals for money/being loved. They have best CC in the game (Poly). They can win 1v3 battles world PvP. They are not countered by racials (only racial that is anti-mage is escape artist). 
---
There is just 1 problem with Mage. It is just horribly boring to me. I have tried to love them, I just can't.
---
I would go Priest given those 2 choices. I do wonder why you decided on not going Warlock tough. Warlock on horde side is a great choice if you don't enjoy Mage playstyle and don't want to respec every week.
---
They are doing much better than the "fun" mobile games, which is what I was replying to.
---
If the creator doesn't respond, you could always fork your own version.
---
I understood that reference
---
Can someone please test to make sure we can still "train" with two or more at one time?  (Train:  fly immediately behind one another, wave, dance, and "choo choo" while heading to destination.)
---
It's the little things, really.  Especially to wave / dance and "choo choo" with a total stranger for one of the longer routes.
---
If they have zero affect as u say how come you just spend time of your life making a post saying they have zero affect?
---
The first awful change they made, though. Server transfers hurt the integrity of the server community by allowing people with a bad rep an easy way to a new start. Before that the price of a new server was 3 months of leveling, suddenly there was nothing forcing you to get along with your community anymore. 
---
It's a shitty system and I wish they wouldn't implement it barring server balancing purposes (free transfers to balance out overpopulated servers)
---
Again, great work! Seriously, this is the kind of map I've always wanted! Now I just have to find a company that can make a high quality canvas and ship to Sweden.
---
Thanks a lot &lt;3 Big thanks to  /u/Eversora 
---
 and /u/Teeb as well!
---
after the MT rogues should get it a lot of rogues use spell power consumes and the proc is nice on a "no" aoe class
---
Nice argument.
---
People still think this game was hard instead of the players being new?
---
Taking your time on something vs Hard
---
I’d say the retail models are a bit too cartoony and the way they move &amp; their facial expressions are just too... well expressive. 
---
I do agree with the animations, especially human, just doesn’t look natural to me.
---
From what I've read usually a raid may carry 1 or 2 locks. So heavily sought after no but needed yeah.
---
i did this with chrome remote desktop, and any time i had to go out to the shop for food i would use it to press buttons in game and prevent me from being afk'd out haha
---
They said that they will not maintain 2 mmo's with balance/content patches. 
---
They also said they would like to hear from the community about BC.
---
BTW just for your interest, this topic gets posted 5-6 times a day
---
Downvotes raining in 5... 4.... 3... 2...
---
Please share your result! See [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here\_have\_some\_upscaled\_highresolution\_wow\_maps/eq29z1t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here_have_some_upscaled_highresolution_wow_maps/eq29z1t/) for some tips that I just gave to someone else.
---
It's gonna be fun to chill in this world again.  I need a server for returning vanilla players, not for the "i'm gonna go farm 50 Action Power pots in Winterlands for duels tomorrow" min-maxing younger crowd exicted to experience vanilla for the first time, although I envy them since I was that hardcore in vanilla.
---
The thing is that behind all that salt is a voice of reason but people are to salty to see.
---
One of my main farming ideas when I was nearing 40, was to run the low level instances solo. With Careful pulls and a good tanking pet,  I could farm the deadmines easily, and I Had mining / enchanting. So could mine several of the nodes for easy copper, and some tin...and could DE any crap material, and vendor all the gray loot drops.  
---
But if lucky, I'd pick up some defias BOE armor, which always sold well for twinks.  I could easily make 40-50g an hour running this alone.
---
&gt;But things like spirit ticks, bag drops, wand damage, elite damage are huge differences apparently.
---
spirit of the game is the same, those are still just minor imo. Yeah classic leveling is going to be easier by some percentage points than private server but it wasn't like private was hard to begin with.
---
Real men never grow up.  
---
Also I let my 4yo complete the first boar quest in Durotar... It will need some time before she can farm for me, unfortunately :(
---
I remember when servers were either down and/or waiting in queue, I would keep this screen up, and lay in my bed listening to the music over and over and over hoping upon hope that it would stop (signifying login was ready) before I fell asleep.
---
Naw, WoW isn't addicting!
---
That's right, delete your stupid comment before more people find out.
---
You still get streamers shoved down your throat. Try being a wow classic fan without seeing constant asmongold reacts recommended on YouTube.
---
I fucking despise asmon and I can accept soda, but there are just soooo many damn videos..
---
Planing on going Tauren Hunter for PVP mainly, any advise against? I know 25% stun resist is good, but so is being a sexy cow.
---
hemo is a lot easier and earlygame with coldblood evis it's just stupid strong. With good mc daggers, then dagger becomes good again especially for premade pvp where you have to kill mages and druids.
---
If you want to PvP, go horde. WotF is as annoying as you think to a Warlock. I remember during Vanilla we were 3 warlocks dueling outside IF all whining and regretting not going horde Warlock.
---
I am sure you make shit ton more money if you sell them on the AH and not just vendor them
---
It's true. I don't expect it to be the same as it was back in vanilla.
---
One of the biggest differences is that people back then were clueless about the game. Nobody was a pro, nobody knew the best tactics for the raid bosses or how to quickly farm the BiS gear before raiding. There was no plethora of online community sites available that held all the information you ever need about every item, quest, raid boss and talent spec in the game.
---
Back then, everyone just.. played the game, you know. For fun. And without a clue.
---
But in classic, most people will simply follow a vast selection of optimized guides for everything.
---
No one can tell the Future....this sub is crazy
---
Herbalism and Mining on my first 1-60 character and my second will be Blacksmith Mining and my third herbalism alchemy.
---
Yea, screw retail and all of its ugly poop artstyle, right?
---
but then no (real) tanks. ;)
---
Would you rather there not be a way to watch the beta? Like would you rather just see nothing but screen shots of regular people playing instead? Would you really be any happier?
---
This is like that classic conundrum:
---
Money
---
Time
---
Energy
---
But you can only pick 2...
---
Rogue fits every category you want, except being underrepresented.
---
Druid fits every category you want, except being raid desired.
---
Warlock fits every category you want, except being high skill cap (at least in PVE, PVP is a different story).
---
Etc. etc.
---
Hunter is a good medium between all of those categories, but not really high on any of them. That might be the way to go. They have great utility, they are needed by raiding guilds for key fights, and do decent enough DPS to justify their spot, all while being kings of WPvP. The Hunter is the very definition of easy to play, difficult to master, and a masterful Hunter is invaluable to a good raiding guild... but they don't need very many. They can do mediocre DPS with a brain-dead player and excellent DPS with a player that truly understands their rotations.
---
Warlock would be you other best option, but they come with some baggage that can be a deal breaker for some people. Their raid rotation is boring as shit, and farming for shards is manageable but becomes very tedious and sometimes you just want to show up to a raid and not have a 30 minute pre-show farm.
---
Well shaman is a jack of all trades , and can tank reliably instances up to lvl50 or even 60 with the right gear. Enh can even heal instances if you really want with the right gear. But stealing agrro from tanks is just sad.
---
I think classic will just be classic. If you want different content play current WoW
---
It's an odd one: guilds without a druid want one more than anything but if they have a few they certainly don't.
---
That's too much.  All Classic needs are better textures, and a few new models, so that the aesthetic feels like Vanilla while not looking like an old game on 4k monitors.
---
Hah dude nice kekin meme!
---
May i ask what is a casual dagger opener? And what do you do if you get in a fight with a mele, can you actaully kill mail plate ?
---
Ha ha what you just said are reasonable and made s lot of sense! Biach!
---
I was chasing a slightly different shot of elwynn, and maybe some others like durotar.
---
I don't think minor speed enchant and pursuit of justice stack.
---
I was going to mention precisely that... but then I thought maybe it's common in other countries.
---
Still latest rank beats wf
---
Then wouldn’t those shards be stacked on each other?... I’m starting to think this is a bad metaphor
---
This guy gets it
---
1. Because they have no heal abilities, not many aoe abilities and only two ranged moves (Charge, and shoot as far as I know). Making it difficult to tag mobs and to take on more than one at a time.
---
2. Duo leveling is a good route
---
3. Any healer would be good with a Warrior or caster. 
---
4. Yes
---
Gotta be druid right?
---
Could you perhaps highlight what you want in an image? Making one for a specific zone is pretty quick so I can do a custom one for you.
---
Calm down.  And watch some asmon reacts.
---
Yea dude, Nostalgia is neat
---
Because it's about the public figure almost representing classic wow atm. If we found out that a streamer is a purebred pedophile, even if it has nothing to do with the game he's streaming, it would still be relevant (not saying that professional fraud and pedophilia is the same, just trying to prove the underlying point)
---
Humans males always reminded me of dogs lol.
---
Maybe.  That was the first thing that popped into my mind though, that it's broken into shards, like a mirror.
---
Tauren Hunter is a great choice. War Stomp is great for PvP, and have you SEEN the size of your melee range in the Classic beta? It's huge, reducing your deadzone? (could be wrong here).
---
But how do you unsee something?
---
Atleast I am happy I never watched 2 girls 1 cup.
---
You are correct.
---
Alright, thanks for the clarification. Might as well delete this post now lol.
---
40-50g an hour farming VC? Lol no..not a chance
---
It varies a lot really. Like versus a mage opening with cheapshot always results in blink, sometimes you want that sometimes you just want to ambush. Melee fights are fine, you still beat warriors most of the time. Retpaladins are stupidly strong in fights like this, you usually just run away. Shamans are hard to duel depends a lot on gear, but getting the fire and poison cleanse totems for blind bandage reopen is crucial, and it has to be done when you don't have flame shock on you :D
---
well you said everything is available from the start except epic mounts. any quests relating to phases that haven't been implemented yet won't be in the game until the phase is launched.
---
1.) No self healing, low damage output till the higher levels, constant trips back to town for supplies.
---
2.) Kinda but not really. Kinda because if you duo your exp is split, but not really because if you have a pocket healer your food runs are not needed.
---
3.) Probably a Priest.
---
4.) Yes.
---
Nah trust me the AVs back in classic were the best you are talking about you might join a game that's already 3 hours in and could still have 3+ hours to go. The race that it turned into was so lame.
---
You know it will be in the summer holiday still right?
---
1-5 grind. Ill do Kill x quests or get x items off a creature but if I cant complete them owell. On a pserver I did starting quest from 1-5 and I grinned 1-5 and grinding was a bit quicker than trying to fight for mobs. As far as gathering professions you just have to get ahead of the curve if you want any.
---
3 months is a long time
---
I am totally also taking three months vacation during september! That way I'll have been lvl 60 for almost two months come october! :D
---
Shut up! My comments are not stupid. You are!
---
My 4 friends and I wanted to make an LAN release event for classic 
---
Our goal is doing deadmines and after that we are "allowed" to sleep. Not before that. Is it somewhat doable if we group up as 5 to take credit for the kills?
---
btw we are german and it starts at 00:00
---
You.. vendored my iron grenades?
---
How dare you
---
People like to plop witless unoriginal zingers about ignoring this and that, but there is one immutable truth.  Vanilla was infinitely better because there was no streaming.
---
I'm not a warrior player myself, so I'll just give you a basic answer based on my limited knowledge. 
---
One of the main reasons for the slow leveling is the fact that you are basically standing in the face is the mob and hitting it, without any major CC to limit your incoming damage. This means that warriors take a lot of damage on every mob, which in turn means they have to eat up very often. That leads to slow leveling, due to higher down time than classes that can kite / heal / etc. 
---
In addition, warriors dealing a lot of damage is dependent on having great gear, which you typically don't have for a lot of the leveling period. 
---
Warriors are great in PvP, but again, are dependent on great gear, and preferably a team to heal etc. In a team right the warriors will be the ones to go in to the middle of the enemy group and dish out damage, while depending on other classes to heal them, remove slows, etc.
---
Just add hard modes to all the dungeons, duh
---
Please delete your comment. We need to mine more salt!
---
The goal is different for everybody. If someone enjoys rushing to 60, that's fine.
---
Yes, I said it that way, but I still thought it was clear that there will be no quests to future content, it makes sense. That's why I did not specify
---
Break up with her just so you can marry her
---
I see i know about mages but mele is kinda hard if the survive the intial ambush backstab ur screwed so how do one actually proceed to open on a mele -warrior? I just need a simble rotation so i can study it and then i can vary from it. But these is energy and stuff and i rather use something than do the math
---
How do you know you’re on the F&amp;F list?
---
I had never hear this word before. Whippersnapper. That made mw gay!
---
Leveling with 4-5 friends.  So far we have a Priest(Holy or Disc), Warrior, Rogue/Hunter/Druid, a mage, and a hunter who will be inconsistent at best.  I've pretty much settled on being a Tauren Shaman, while leveling a rogue in my spare time for professions, BGs, and I love the class.
---
For Shaman, I wanted to go Enhancement but the review of the spec is... lack luster to say the least.  Would it be wiser to go Elemental and be a jack of all trades in the group(have the spell power to spot heal, can use Earthen Golem totem to off tank, use shocks and CC) or stick with Enhancement and pray to RNJesus.
---
For rogue, what horde race is the most fun?  Was looking at troll or undead with a leaning towards undead.
---
TF is legendary weapon, I doubt 3 of your tanks will have it.
---
It's pure rng, an hardcore Pserver guild (dreamstat? can't remember) said that they didn't get to have a single TF for 5 years of raiding MC every week.
---
Mained Horde mage forever (tried all the races).  In classic I'm gonna go Alliance and play Gnome mage.  Are there any unforeseen regrets I will have?  I'm thinking Gnome for the 5% int buff which seems huge.
---
We Jesus shaming now?
---
The time you stayed at home for 5 days without your family*
---
If you don't want to respec from healer, Holy Nova is probably the best for farming gold. However, most healers either switch spec to farm or they group up with for instance a Warrior for some great farming methods.
---
Easy to play in PvE, I assume you mean healing. Shaman and Paladin are easier in raids because they both use only 1 healing spell most of the time. Shamans keep totems up and spam Chain Heal. Paladins keeps blessings up and spam their single target heal. I think spamming Chain Heal is a lot more satisfying, personally.
---
I personally prefer Shaman over Paladin due to the PvP playstyle, but Paladins are concidered the strongest PvP healer in the game.
---
Raids bring more Shamans than they do Paladins in the early raids. They will want 1 shaman in each group. Paladins become strong with a lot of crit, something they don't have early on. 
---
I say Shaman &gt; Paladin &gt; Priest.

I care about streamers as much as I care about a fart in a crowded elevator. I just want to get out but the doors are closed. I try to hold my nose but that just means the feces particles will go in my mouth. There is no hiding from these feces particles and what has been smelled cant be unsmelled.
---
This seems so much lower than it was on private servers.
---
keep telling yourself there buddy
---
Is le wife single?!?
---
But... It's not.
---
* There will probably be queues. The character creation head start might help with this a bit though so we will have to wait and see
---
* Depends a lot how well layering will work on launch. On non-layered launches the starting areas are pretty bad. Fetch quests, grouping up for mob tags, explore xp and killing mobs in a group outside of starting area are the options I have set for myself.
---
* Gathering professions should be possible to do as many will focus solely on leveling.
---
* My plan is to play till I reach level 30. This will take most like more than 30 hours on launch.
---
* If you want to be ahead of the pack, just play more than others. Have a questing route planned, be ready to adapt and do not be afraid to group up. If you are not worried about the leveling speed, just take it easy and enjoy the ride! :)
---
Come the hell down mate
---
Well, for casual players yeah... but for hardcore, it was either quit or enjoy a dead server. It was a real issue when guilds started to die in AQ40.
---
A lot of people roll Warrior to start... get to 10 - 15, realize it is balls to level a Warrior, and re-roll as Hunter / Mage / Rogue. Don't let the initial Warrior hype deter you, if you are steadfast and dedicated, you will rise to the top.
---
I know they preserved my first character for stress test 1 and let me continue on it for stress test 2. That being said I can only imagine them using the same people and characters for future stress tests..... but who knows.
---
Apologies, I was getting heated because of some other commenters. But the way I see it is that classic should stick to their roots, and if they allow people to swap gold across server (in my opinion) it just ruins the classic experience that everyone is hoping for. Like I remember when I was playing the game back then, and I saw someone with an epic mount and thought that was the coolest thing ever. But if people can just swap the gold over, they'll never experience that feeling.
---
How is some streamer who usually gets just over a thousand viewers "representing" Classic WoW? The majority of people don't give a shit.
---
Fraud, paedophile, whatever, it doesn't make it relevant unless the action is tied to WoW itself. This is just a guy who happens to play WoW and happens to be committing fraud. Tips also drinks water, you gonna post this on /r/water?
---
&gt;thunderclap to death, repeat.
---
Thunderclap does next to no damage in vanilla. This was changed in wrath.
---
So for farming you have some options. If you have enginering reflector shield and good gear you can farm stratlive runs, it doesn't have to be reserve runs if you do it with friends, but else yeah it kinda does. There's nothing wrong with reserving the gold drops from a dungeon, you are helping freshly dinged 60's to clear the dungeons they need with a strong tank. You can also do the same thing.. but with onyxia. Keep in mind your guild of course, but if they don't mind, you can pug onyxia with some reserves, maybe do a little gold bid on the head of onyxia and bag, ez money, and again you are helping the server get onyxia pugs out. If people don't reserve some to make it worth it, then onyxia isn't getting killed. 
---
Lastly professions ofc, mining, herbalism hell even fishing isn't all that bad. A lot of tanks I know don't want to have a gathering professions so they fish.
---
If I was to give a "What is the best race class combo to play in Classic?" answer, it would be this. You're golden. Only thing that can stop you is if you don't enjoy the playstyle.
---
Fury Warriors then Destruction Warlocks then way way after Hunters and Mages.
---
Mages have to drink all the time and craft water and food for everyone.  If you want to raid, there are 39 other raiders to feed.  Mages also die quite easily.  There are a lot of negatives.  Warlocks provide a lot of utility.  And they have plenty of interesting PvP choices.  Mages play frost and that's about it.
---
I have never watched a stream. But the ides of other people watching a stream us upsetting.
---
I actually intend on focusing more on PvE rather than PvP. But will do PvP here and there.
---
Duels aren't something that I really se myself doing that much tho (if at all).
---
I'm leaning Horde right now, mostly because of Undead Warlock class fantasy and Undead casting animations.
---
Amazing explanation, thank you so much. I'll be sure to save this comment for my own leveling.
---
Same. I did this more during tbc launch on another server though.
---
I think you should try directing some of your questions to perplexity,he's the guy to talk to really. https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya
---
There was a time, but not for WoW
---
I see thank you for all the info you shared with me :)
---
I remember it was one of the releases wherein the healing mod would select which healing spell to cast on the player.
---
So much for learning to know whether or not your tank was well geared, hit-capped, and skilled; whether or not your rogue knew how and when to stun to allow you to get off some quick heals, shields and maybe a renew because damage was bringing you heal aggro.  
---
I don't mind the addons that give you more information, i.e., maps, amount of health on a mob, organizing bags, mail, etc.  We did all of MC with no aggro meters, but we also had to learn how to control our DPS and learn to work with (and listen to) our tanks.  We also had to learn defense and not to blame stuff on the tanks for not paying attention.
---
CtRaid was oneo f the first addons, and it covered your entire screen; and it was required.  Even if you were dps by some guilds.  NOW mods tell the raid leader exactly when and what spells you are casting, on who and when.
---
I don't mind the raid meters, as I think that's a useful tool to learn; but I hate when RL's who are former healers, mages, warriors, rogues "review" each man's performance and critique it based on their 'rerun' of the fight.  What they are missing is the defense moves made -- and not realizing that defense in Classic is sometimes just as important as dps.
---
Never played classic before, but very hyped for it.
---
I'm looking to play a healer, in BFA I'm playing druid but the sound of being an innervate slave in classic doesn't really sound appealing to me, priest looks fun and I enjoyed leveling it in the stress test, what is Shaman/Paladin gameplay in classic like?
---
Basically just asking what the most fun healer class is to play. Doesn't really matter if it doesn't top meters, just looking to enjoy the game.
---
I was a tank in Vanilla and you did not roll Fury you had Fury talents but you had to stay in Defensive Stance and roll mostly Defensive traits or you would get smoked. Fury warriors were glass canons they did a ton of damage but couldn't take a hit.
---
Seriously? One of those "developers" is World of Warcraft’s Executive Producer. But you seriously need a "Community Managers" say so? Mmkay...
---
Thank you sir!
---
VEry important to remember this to those shitters saying "pservers dont matter". u wouldn't have ur classic if people like those didn't exist
---
That game had the best tank class ever. The Ironbreaker.  It proved that you could make a tank class that actually works in pvp.  
---
You chose a group member as an oath friend and you got bonus grudges (rage) when that person took damage.  And when you taunted another player you did double damage to that player till they attached you back.  So, the tram could taunt players off the healer or beat them into the ground if they ignored the tank.  All buffs the ironbreaker put on himself got shared by his oath friend.  The Ironbreaker also took half the damage that his oath friend sustained after armor mitigation.  
---
So the ironbreker generated bonus rage when the marked player was attacked, he took half the players damage, he buffed the player, and could CC like a boss with a knock down and a 30 yard knockback.  Bonus for being a dwarf exclusive class.
---
Best class ever.
---
That’s clutch.
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
But as usual, if Classic is successful, TBC is inevitable. Look at any of the polls this sub takes on the topic and it's consistently a 60/40 split where the 40 want TBC. That's way too many people for Blizzard to ignore considering most of the work is already done.
---
&gt; What do you like so much about it?
---
I was a Paladin.
---
Kind of a double edged sword since it makes it a bit harder to kite. You're such a huge target that people don't need to get as close to you either.
---
&gt; When Classic was announced I didnt even know what a Streamer was. ignorance is bliss. 
---
For someone hating what Streamers do for classic and not knowing what they are, you seem very interested since you post a lot in /r/LivestreamFail 
---
Don't be jealous of other people and you will enjoy life a lot more 
---
Just wanted to point that out
---
Sherlock over and out!
---
Another point of view from a german player:   
---
I think I am able to speak and understand english enough to participate in my job and to use it for other purposes like online gaming and holidays.
---
But I met many native english speakers, who never tried to learn another language and therefore have absolutely no idea, that it is slightly more charging to use a foreign language for 3 hours in your free time, instead of your own language where you dont have to think before you talk. 
---
And because many native speakers talk very fast, add a bit of slang and use urban dictionary without thinking once about slowing down, while being irritated why the other person is confused, it often does not feel like an arrangement for finding a middle ground.
---
It is even more funny, when you are participating in online threads and people start to grammar nazi your comments, instead of appreciating, that the world came to the conclusion to speak your language.
---
I am not salty about that, dont want to insult anyone or pass the buck back to you, just wanted to give another point of view that could maybe prevent heated situations. :-)
---
But there will be german servers, because even in 2005 there were dozenwith a stabile player base, so this will not be a problem anyway.  
---
Just my five cents, for the horde! :-)
---
Eh, is raid frames a QOL upgrade, though? It's functionally the same thing as vanilla, just different styling.
---
Nah a lot of raids went with the 5k threat rule not a 3-4 sunder mark that 3-4 sunder stack was BC cause you had a lot more ways to drop threat or threat boost tanks. You did not spec out of prot though in Vanilla you did put points in fury for hit rating and crit chance but you still needed to get maxed out in Prot for the improved specials.
---
Home Alone: World of Warcraft Special
---
its because the pvp one had 12k online and it was so laggy
---
They don't even have to remove it.   
---
They just make it irrelevant.   
---
One of the pillars of what makes Classic so exciting, is that all the content in it is relevant.
---
I did buy the Minecraft beta for 10usd but they didnt delete my world after 3 month and charged me 15usd/month...
---
Well, he had/has direct contact with Blizzard emploees and participated in their events for Classic and Blizzcon.
---
Druids are quite flexible.  Not as much as they are in current WoW, but they definitely offer a lot of options.
---
Oh yeah I read what you fucking wrote. It's not my fault if what you wrote is stupid. This sun moon thing is extremely practical for blizzard employees when they review screenshots and vids, is it.

&gt;Originally flight paths were animated manually by a designer.
---
I doubt this. The pitch, roll and yaw can all be calculated to natural angles based on the path. Blizzard could've just made a Rollercoaster Tycoon type of flight path builder in which you set some pathing points and connect them using various line curvatures.
---
The main reason is for the environment but I did want that mount eventually too. 
---
You can’t ride other races mounts if you get the rep in classic?
---
As a 30 year old man, who plays like a 14 year old boy, I plan on ganking lowbies, highbies, and my levelbies. If it's red it's dead.
---
Cosmetic QOL like the barber should be fine to implement.
---
If you like spamming one spell(frostbolt) for the entirety of a boss fight, then mage is for you.
---
Pvp is way more fun as mage
---
And for the record, no one is doing 7k dps in Classic.  Just in case anyone reads this and doesn't know that.  Good dps will be like 1k IIRC.
---
So if addons weren't enabled in WoW, no one would clear any raids ever?
---
But that's a part of the gamer experience now, dude!
---
All hail classic
---
Do those Blizzard employees also work for the business committing the fraud..? Is he paying those employees off with fraudulent money? What does it matter? Not saying the fraud thing is okay, it's just got literally nothing to do with Classic WoW.
---
You are literal salt mine, I don't think all the other people are wrong.
---
Also if you have somewhat knowledge of wow you should know that these guys have full decked out best in slot lvl 30 gear
---
A lot of polls I see have mages as being very popular so I don't see the benefit based on your criteria.
---
You're ignoring trends, though. It used to be ego shooters, then MMOs, then MOBAs and now BRs.
---
The genre is no longer the hot shit it used to be so naturally the mainstream gamers will go where the mainstream genre is.
---
Personally I think BfA sucks and I look forward to getting to play classic again but not everyone is me. Nobody knows the 8 million individual reasons players stopped playing the game. I know mine. I know of some friends and many vocal classic lovers. But this is all anecdotal. I never played with casuals so my sample group is extremely biased. Same for forums like reddit or mmo-champ. The average gamer does not visit those (couple thousand users vs a peak of 12 million players).
---
So it might seem overwhelmingly true to me everyone just quit because the game strayed away from classic but it means nothing because my data is biased. And so is yours. All we really know is that there is a sizeable playerbase that is interested in classic. How long they will stay and how big it actually is and how many people will get tangled up that never thought they would is a big ? but it certainly won't fail, judging by the long term success of pservers.
---
While leveling enhance is by far the best spec for a shaman. Ele is just too mana starved. You can just keep some intellect gear if you need to heal a dungeon. For your weapon staves are really good for shaman as they have great damage and the spirit/into are great for sham. You can even get away with using them over taking the talent for 2h axe/mace. 
---
As for rogue race, UD of course. Easy choice :P
---
&gt; How salty do you have to be to make a Reddit post targetting literally 1% of the beta population.
---
Maybe because that 1% have like over a 100k supernerd followers making our life a misery or something I donno.
---
I made a good amount of gold at 60 with engineering.
---
Mages will be over represented.  Everyone will love you more for playing a priest plus they're more interesting.
---
Definitely agree, it's a pain but I don't really mind that part as much. It's also a pain to farm so with limited free time I don't want to end up behind the curve and lose a raid/guild spot because of it. That being said, I know the class and mechanics so 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The confusing part is that I haven't seen the reaction towards it, I don't know how reliable the information is, and it's hard to take a standpoint based on "rumors"
---
Don't know about you, but 5000 gold was still a lot in TBC and Epic flying mounts felt just as hard to get, at least for me.
---
for elwynn, was hoping to get the bottom of it in too without much other zones but I think that's the best I can get. Stormwind top left is the biggest thing I wanted.
---
and then a shot like this of lordaeron. or maybe just hillsbrad since other wise it looks too small.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
I've already experienced it on a pserver
---
My pipe dream is lateral progression. Expand the tamable pet pool, add hairstyles and skintones, other cosmetic features, more companion pets, more armor models, and eventually transmog and scrapped content.
---
Essentially, I want Vanilla WoW as it was envisioned before things wound up on the cutting room floor.
---
Give me Emerald Dream or give me death!
---
And lower resolutions.
---
Playing at 720p or higher we just won't have this issue anymore
---
Add death knights, or no death knights??
---
but they're all frauds. The only real one is the one with me and my boys
---
These are confirmed:
---
* Normal PVE
---
* Normal PVP
---
* RP PVE 
---
Not confirmed:
---
* RP PVP 
---
The community seems to be very loud about it, maybe they will change it so all will be there on release, which I think is very likely
---
In terms of ruining classic hype. You don't understand context?
---
Were we in the same guild?  Haha
---
Yeah, this dude (Pru in my guild) would let his kids on to farm all the time. If they didn't respond to a tell, probably a kid.
---
Someone wrote it on reddit so it must be true.
---
Oh man, that sounds pretty fun. Also, race locked classes sound interesting.
---
People loved Legion. Day one sales in a subscription based game mean nothing. It's all about how many people stick around after initial purchase.
---
I bought the exp hoping it would become as good as Legion. It wasn't. I quit less than a month in with over a month of subscription left. Can't count people like me as happy customers.
---
I played a priest almost exclusively through vanilla and tbc.  I know what I'm talking about.
---
The issue is not just about players latency or ping man, it's about code in the game that changes everything about 'melee range' functions for every hitbox in the game.  
---
Feel free to message me with all your clips Zetox#1233 on Discord

---
Mages can also play Pom-Pyro to kill the EFC or just for the memes, later on with the right gear there is elemental mage which is super fun with all the instants and lets them handle casters better.
---
Mages only die quite easily if they unbind blink and ice block.

---
No the deadzone isn’t decreased.
---
They have high pitched voices (e.g. When saying you're out of range). I personally like it but make sure you can stand it before you commit.
---
My old main was a gnome mage and I loved it.
---
He can use that enchanting gold to buy my thorium bars.
---
Also true, but since I can level faster and farm better that was my thought process as far as time.
---
I GAMON WILL SAVE US !
---
They do though, but it's mostly positive. I *loved* vanilla but had no interest in playing Classic, but after watching streams of the beta all my memories came flooding back and seeing streamers enjoy it as much as they do even after all these years made me so hyped, and I think a lot of others feel the same. All these streamers are essential for marketing Classic.
---
Vanilla healing isn't necessarily about complexity or difficulty. Vanilla healing is more about being out in the world and farming pre-raid consumables.
---
Paladins are amazing. You cast Flash Heal. Over and over and over again. Then maybe you Cleanse. Oh and buffs, but maybe another Paladin with take care of those. Really, you just spam Flash Heal and never go Oom.
---
So yeah, Vanilla fun is in raid-prep, not so much actual raiding. This is generally considered to be a *good thing.*
---
Okay maybe some changes
---
I hear ya. I actually just resubbed tonight and honestly retail isn't so bad. I tried ESO lately to kill time until classic and holy shit nope. If I play retail until classic without trying to compare the two I can enjoy the pvp and dungeons for the time being.
---
But yeah, absolutely no community or identity in the modern game. Classic will be a breath of fresh nerd air I have long missed.
---
Very brief summary glossing over a lot of details:
---
Priests: boring but very efficient to level with wand spec, very desired healer, shadow spec not great at end game
---
Shaman: okay to level, very desired healer due to chain heal spam, off-specs bad at end game
---
Druid: fun and efficient to level, but only a handful per raid as they're the weakest healing class, one of the least played classes, off-specs viable with dedication
---

If you are a popular streamer or someone often present in given game content - interviews, podcasts, you become a public figure within that game community. It's also the bad side of the internet - people will start digging. I'm not calling for anything due to that company deeds but being a public figure will inevitably lead to people asking Tips what's is all about. If not explained it will lead to even more drama which may affect the game or other content creators working on the game.
---
Lack of any activity from Tips may indicate he either can't say anything now due to legal actions or doesn't know how to address it even if he isn't involved. Lack of response leads to people asking what's going on and pushing the problem to an even wider audience.
---
The increase hit box just pushes the deadzone further out, but it stays the same size AFAIK.

lol u mad brooooooooooo, its funny to see that :D :D :D
---
He was a real human bean.
---
In vanilla priest is far superior. Druid will basically be innervating the priests. Shaman I’m not as sure as I played alliance in vanilla. They seem like a fun class.
---
Thing is, on launch people aren't going to have disposable income to spend on vanity consumables.
---
You are not allowed to name private server names in here, just for you information.
---
Hey man, never played any of those classes during vanilla so I can't really help you there, however there are a bunch of instant 60 private servers that will allow you to test these classes at max level, just be warned that it's not a true representation as usually these servers are riddled with bugs. I am not sure if we are allowed to link to private servers but a quick google search will help you out.
---
He's probably just salty he spent any money he had on expensive streaming equipment for his zero-viewers Twitch account that he's filled to the brim with jealosy of successful streamers.
---
Layering will save launch. Their stress testing so many opportunities between now and then, while already having done a few and learned a lot. Omar seems to be on top of this technology and I am pretty optimistic launch will be more smooth than most imagine.
---
Sorry I hurt your feelings dude..I never asserted that you were intentionally trying to deceive; but rather that the clip and the way it was presented was deceptive because it is. Those two are not the same thing.

Starting with possibly 3-5 friends. A couple of us played back in Burning Crusade up to BFA and lost interest. My main was a druid which I loved above every class I've played. However, I know that is not the Vanilla druid experience.   
---
Friend 1 - Priest  
---
Friend 2 - Rogue/  
---
Friend 3 - Hunter (She has barely played) Will this class be too complicated for a new player?  
---
Friend 4 - Mage/Warlock  
---
Friend 5 - ??? (Not sure she's sold on it yet)  
---
I'm torn between rogue or druid. I'm not completely sold on my tanking capabilities as a druid and I don't know that I love the idea of healing in later stages of the game. However, I know that I liked the rogues play-style. I will just miss the versatility of a druid.
---
Great thanks for the link man :) Sorry don't want to spam the sub, I'm sure it's a common question.
---
I disagree. Anyone whose memory is still relatively intact, who played a lot of Vanilla and loved the game definitely does not need a streamer to get them pumped for the Classic release. Just my opinion.
---
No, not OP. They're insanely bugged. Including some, one might say, game-breaking level bugs. It makes them very hard to actually play normally.

I'd say anyone over the age of 25 is way too old to be making bratty little kid posts like this. Under 25 and you get a pass, since early 20s kids are still fucking stupid.
---
I'm sure they know that and still choose to play that way. The problem is when people complain that others aren't playing the "right way." It's just a video game, so if people are having fun then it's fine they aren't doing it optimally.
---
each expansion has many fans, each expansion gets released
---
Paladins have to buff A LOT.  Buffs didn't last very long and everyone wanted them.  So, you'll be a slave to that.  Shaman and priest healers are fun IMO.  Priests are better.  Remember, only Horde can be Shaman and only Alliance can be Paladin.

Oh right makes sense....Would you mind PMing me? I'm clueless when it comes to private servers and I'm just looking to not crash my cpu with a fake one
---
sorry put links in now, that elwynn one is pretty much it! Can you zoom it in a bit more? thats the main one I'm after.
---
Thanks so much.
---
They cannot. U give them a finger and boom...bfa again.
---
I'm not a casual and I feel offended that you insinuate I am (what an aggravating and illogical conclusion)
---
"For someone on a full server with enough recruits maybe" would have done the trick without diminishing me as someone who just hasn't played the game enough to like transfers.
---
I also explicitly mentioned transfers as a way to balance server population.
---
Thanks! I figured it was about as effective and thought out as yours. You make the jump from a clock to quest helpers(which WILL be made as addons) to balancing in the same thought. Its the same delusion scare-tatic copy pasta argument every time.
---
Don’t forget the hidden racial: what your mount looks like. I’ll be rolling more trolls than undead this time around, and I don’t think I’m the only one.
---
In terms of PVE healing, Pala is probably best, imo. For farming gold, probably Priest (if we're remaining in healing spec for all 3 classes that is).
---
And what would you suggest between herbing or skinning for more efficient gold making?
---
&gt; No use binding naked Stealth to a key, when it's not usable in combat. Therefore, the same button triggers stealth or Vanish, depending on whether I am in combat or not.

Might be good for questing/grinding/PvE in general, but if you play PvP, this is a terrible idea. Many times as a rogue you are just trying to reset the fight while spamming the stealth key to enter stealth as soon as you leave combat. Then the vanish/stealth macro is not optional. Some hunters apply the same principle with trap and feign death/trap in a single macro. I personally dislike it
---
It is also bullshit because it is the only encounter in the entire game that needs this ridiculous amount of tanks.
---
At some point they need to redo that encounter similar to the Twins in AQ40.
---
Are you getting hyped when you see streamers faceroll vanilla dungeons?
---
Man you are salt machine, stahp.
---
You can literally see him get up and walk around on stream frequently lmao
---
Omg, how many times a day do we have to see this exact topic?!
---
I'm not specifically looking for the "superior" healer, I'm just looking for the most fun. I understand superior may mean more enjoyable though. I just want to have as much insight before picking my final class. Thanks for the input :)
---
Literally only reason I won't go Orc is because I like too many Vanilla swords. I'll sacrifice BiS 1h for a good sword I think looks cool lol
---
You'd rather have nothing at all?
---
Faceroll a Dungeon 100 times? thats actually called testing do you even know how you normaly would test something internaly? you do it over and over and hope you find no bugs
---
&gt; They have zero impact on me.
---
Yet here you are...
---
Looks like your friend group needs a tank!
---
Every day is a different Megathread with the Topic of the day.
---
If you want to inform yourself, this will be the best place.
---
Also you can use the reddit search function for detailed class guides! ;)
---
How annoying was it to find a group for instances? I remember in vanilla as a priest (with a warrior friend) we were always annoyed with hunters. For one, there were so many of them, and a lot of them were really bad.
---
I really like doing dungeons, while leveling and at 60, and I don't want to be the last person being considered for a group or feeling like the 5th wheel every time.
---
 Imagine being this mad about a thing you could just ignore.
---
f j f d  
---
You have it in analkill part xD
---
&gt; Before that the price of a new server was 3 months of leveling, suddenly there was nothing forcing you to get along with your community anymore. 
---
It was not. Because if you wanted to raid Nax, you couldnt without server transfer if you were stuck on a server that couldnt progress.
---
So yeah, I see the causal angle behind it, but for hardcore players back then, it was not much of a choice.
---
Should I go for shadow or Holy priest for raids when I wanna pvp as well - the respec cost kinda scares me
---
&gt;If you're interested in PVE and playing feral, Ally's better.
---
Is that just due to BoK or do alliance have other perks that really help ferals? I’ve been thinking of going Druid but I’m also more of a PvE kind of person.
---
BRUH
---
you must be trolling
---
That about sums it up, I'd add that dwarf priests are particularly sought after due to fear ward
---
You would rather destroy classic than occasionally *maybe* having to sit in que for a small amount of time? Yikes my dude.
---
then they all get reported for sexism
---
He said the stock market has been GOOD to him...
---
Agreed with your pvp builds.  I meant mages are squishier in that they get 1 shot easier (on pve mostly but also pvp).
---
leveling? Yeh there's not going to be much of that going on.
---
Not Banned = No violation of ToS.
---
Either refute the only thing were arguing about or stop saying "Your wrong" like a parrot over and over with no actual retort.
---
It's embarassing.
---
I'll probably get a good, early sleep then get up super early and push forward. That way I'll be online before the late sleepers, and stay online longer than most of those who played from 11pm... should be a sweet spot of sorts.
---
Oh wow I never thought about the mounts, that's huge. I agree trolls &gt; undead when it comes to their mount's looks
---
I would do it, but I quit playing pservers many years ago. 
---
I'm sure someone else with more experience in these will give you a message!
---
Definitely! I don't know who would want that responsibility though!
---
can we get a horde version
---
?????
---
Yeah I've just gone through the full blue post and they do say it's the first 1% hit from any source.
---
I didnt know I needed this...thx.
---
I wish shamans had a legit tank spec. Love the class fantasy.. but also love tanking.
---
You get upset by what other people find enjoyable? You do you man but that's an outlook that will be nothing but trouble for you as life rolls along.
---
I thought only other Engineers could use them though? That would kind of greatly limit the market for those if it's correct.
---
If you wanna raid and pvp in the same spec, you're gonna have a hard time playing optimal builds.  This goes for any class.  If you wanna play priest, holy is more desired and better.
---
It's not a scare-tactic, it's a literal concern of the community. Blizzard has a reputation of listening to a certain vocal minority and ruining their games. You can lash out all you want like a child, but that doesn't change that fact.
---
Why does there have to be a plan? Why can't they just release classic and then people play classic? That's the whole point.
---
Not banned =/= not having action taken against you.
---
It's not my problem you are too stupid to realize that being banned *is not* the only action takes against players.
---
It is not only asinine to assetrt as much. It's just plain fucking stupid.
---
I have been set on shaman for months and months and playing an ele/resto hybrid to heal in raids and pvp at same time. I realize its a lot of time to gear up for that spec and honestly I wont have to much time to play (the leveling Windfury random Wpvp crist seem awesome even if they are 20% of the time)  
---
Recently Ive been really looking at Rogues after watching Payo's stream. honestly I justwanna wreck some people while leveling up and ganking them and then roam the world killing lowbies and others due to time constraits.
---
Rogue or Shammy?!?!??!1
---
Yea, it was meant to be weeks.
---
Only thing is. I love healing in raids. (healed on a holy pally throughout most other expansions)
---
I can see why he's confused, you mean go with the spell with the newest rank.
---
There is plenty of PvP on PvE servers.  Southshore was a bloodbath back in vanilla.
---
You'll likely regret going gnome just for the racial if you hate gnomes appearance.
---
Ohmy. I see you havent played a lot of Vanilla.
---
Spirit is great for hunters and all mana userd. You generate mane after 5sec while not casting.
---
Rogues never have that sap talent while leveling.
---
Eleshaman? What? lol. 100% of shamans level as enh and you can freaking raidheal in any spec. Talwntd as hardly any affect on healing, its mostly for mana over long fights.
---
A tank 6lvl under final boss. I guess, bosses are not the hard part though.
---
Humans are just OP. Weapon skill, bonus to rep gains, and situationally useful in pvp perception. Looks are good and all and having shadowmeld is sweet. But the time savings and hit chance sell it for me personally
---
They broke the enemy nameplate distance console command...bummer. it's way too close now for my taste, but I'll live with it.
---
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. Other games that do not increase the level cap at each expansion have zones where the power level of the player is scaled down to make lower level areas challenging. Also, some of those games force you to follow the story of those new areas before you can reach the end game content of the expansion.
---
As some have already mentioned, resistance to different kind of damages is a very good option. You can use the example of WotLK where most enemies could have frost damage. In that specific expansion tou could even add a new system like Fatigue. 
---
You are in a frozen continent, you need to be prepared for the weather. Objects obtained through quests and drops could have a property that increases the duration of time you can spend outdoors until reaching a point where you become immune to that “fatigue”. You could also craft or find gear enhancement that gives to your old gear more resistance to it.
---
By not increasing the level cap but introducing specific gear that allows you to explore this new content, new players can skip old content they may not like and jump into the new expansion. New expansions could introduce new content that goes from lvl 50-55 to 60.
---
They give beta to many people because they know it will happen like this. Just imagine your testing the rested experience.
---
Communication shouldn't be a one-sided thing, ever. If the only reason that communication occurs is because you start it, every time, then that's just really sad. It's demoralising and just bad for the health of the game.
---
One of the reasons for the strong communities in vanilla WoW was because it had a way of making even the introvert types more extrovert, and it did so in a natural way. That's important, because many of those types of players wouldn't do so otherwise and wouldn't form any meaningful connections. Expecting players to play in the way that is most fun (i.e. by forming friends within the game) when the path of least resistance is to just not do any of that is plainly foolish and bad game design.
---
It's like the games which give you 10 different weapons, some of which are really cool and interesting to use, but then you have one weapon that just says "Best for every situation" which trivialises large portions of the game and is generally boring to use. People are going to use only that weapon and then complain that the game is boring because you never get to use other weapons, even though they're right there at all times. That's just how it is and it's something that game designers need to take into account, not chalk it up to players "playing the game wrong".
---
Yep shoutout to /u/SunwindPC for helping me out :D
---
I love how this is getting downvoted :D this subreddit is so silly
---
Same - except I’m level 0 and have legit not even logged in at all.
---
As somebody that has played the shit out of vanilla (both in retail and p-servers) I see absolutely no point whatsoever to login.  Would rather keep things as fresh as possible for the actual release.  I have no interest at all in bug testing and turning a game into some sort of weird job either...
---
But I know some raids have 1 priest in there, would that be a spot worth going for?
---
😘 😘
---
?????????
---
&gt; The 6th proc of shadow weaving refreshes the timer of all stacks?or they have different timers?    
---
They all share the same timer. So any reapply resets the countdown on all 5x.    
---
&gt; since Mind Flay does not trigger shadow weaving on all ticks?   
---
I don't think Shadow Weaving is why Imp. MB is good for PvP, just the additional burst. There are certain classes/specs (like healers, Druids) where you need all you can get. Mind Flay not adding stacks with each tick is disappointing but not as major as you'd think.    
---
&gt; Instant cast resets the mp5 rule? Mind Flay resets the mp5 rule? Meditation affects this mechanic?   
---
Yes and yes. Meditation means you always have 15% regen minimum regardless of the 5 second rule. This increases to 100% when outside of the 5 second rule. Meaning Spirit continues to be a strong stat for the class, and if you're low getting out of the 5 second rule still plays a role.    
---
I always take Spirit Tap for leveling. The weakness in this context isn't the talent, it is getting a killing blow in PvP. Spirit Tap allows 50% (Vs. 15% for meditation) regen to continue while inside the five second rule AND increases your Spirit by 100%. But Spirit Tap is only 15 seconds/killing blow, Meditation is a passive/always on. In PvE leveling killing blows are frequent and easy, in PvP they're rare and hard.
---
IM SORRY
---
Hey man, where's everyone getting this "there will be a wave today" vibe?
---
It’s level 30 content and they have full BIS gear do you think they should wipe 20 times each run ?
---
In any case I have been watching them constantly and am in the beta and my excitement has never been higher for classic.
---
Cheers mate, just don't get burned out on pservers before Classic comes out :D
---
Oh yes. I just commented on it. It pops in way too close to the mobs for my taste.
---
Warlocks are not highly sought after by raiding guilds. A good warlock will always get a raid spot and they do tons of damage. However, a 40 man raid will have about 2 to 4 warlocks. And they don't exactly have a high skill cap compared to other classes.
---
Soulshard farming is overblown, they don't expire when you log out and you can just farm 100 of them once a week and keep them in your bank, it takes around 15 minutes to do.
---
No, because you can keep shooting your bow at 1ft distance. And since you can't really die while questing in retail there is no need for complicated hunter rotations
---
True. As long as you aren’t literal trash fear ward alone can get you places. I’ve seen it a lot when I was a night elf priest.

Not in Scotland! Schools go back 2nd week in August, and Uni's go back last week Aug/1st week in Sept.
---
&gt;The fishing rod thing is interesting because it suggests that druids are currently using weapon skill based off of the weapon they're equipping.
---
Not really, you have a standard weapon skill rule, druid exception (weapon skill = 5 * character level) and fishing rod exception ( weapon skill = fishing profession skill). One of those two exceptions has to take priority.
---
I mean, you can fix it after 60, with time invested. But most folk will be using their 60% speed mount for a long time, and won’t want to store spares, so it’s as valid as the racial character animations and emote sounds/voices.
---
Feel free to watch his stream or any of his vods
---
So you want to be on a streamer server or not? Im confused.
---
I am planning on leveling a horde shammy for nostalgia sake. On alliance I want to level something that is great fun for WPvP but is not a rogue. I was thinking of Mage. Any opinions?
---
I won't, it's just to test out the early levels and the "feel" of those three classes
---
Out of curiosity, why did you sign up for beta then?
---
Talantir, 100% playing classic
---
Imagine that. My experience was much different. On my server it was not uncommon for me to get tells while I was already tanking in one dungeon by randoms looking for a tank who were just /who-ing dungeons looking for tanks that might be available eventually since trade was dead.
---
Between this and all the people who added me after a group I never wanted for groups. This is probably the biggest draw to re-rolling a tank for me. It was insanely easy to get groups, and as the tank you generally ran them and had a good say in how the dungeon was approached and the classes we would bring if we had a choice
---
You and me both dude don’t burn out. Got to 30 pvped my heart out but now I’m done till launch. 
---
I want it to be fresh on launch.
---
How did that make modern warfare gay?
---
With windfury.
---
Alliance warriors will go dual wield
---
to\*
---
If you wait until launch to grab your names, you will be 2 weeks behind.   They are opening names 2 weeks earlier - you can reserve 3 per server.
---
It's really just having to spend like 15 minutes before raids farming soul shards, not that tedious especially if incorporated into farming something else at the same time. On my mage I probably spent just as much time crafting food &amp; water.
---
A *lot* of people will go engineering, and iron grenades are kind of the affordable spam-all-day PvP grenades.
---
If you get a piece of defias armour, it sells to twinks for 10gold an item. Easy money. 
---
Now, maybe not able to do this in the 1st 2-3 months of release cos of new economy, but I made loads from farming the deadmines back in vanilla, with BOEs, cloth, ore, vendor crap and enchanting mats.
---
My comment was assuming you had equivalent weapons.
---
I'm not saying tools were not used, but designers talked about making these flight paths manually years ago. It's not just pitch and yaw and pathing points either, but involves deliberate decisions to take detours and scenic routes.
---
Not to mention all the content they cut to hit the launch deadline, some of which did make it in later at least.
---
Its 2019, women can be boys.
---
thought so.
---
Didnt a streamer lead a pvp raid on retail and Blizzard thanked them by teleporting them all away because they caused lagg?
---
Yeah they all have their role, if you truly love healing go priest as they have the biggest tool kit for healing. You could also consider pally, the are insane tank healers and very durable
---
With all the testing they're doing and the sharding I don't think it'll be a problem at all.
---
At 60 quest XP was converted to gold. The difference in quest rewards from 59 to 60 was massive
---
It again
---
Problems reading? Offtank can easily be fury or arms and they do 4x ferals dps. Dps warr in tank gear sure does beat feral in tanking, especialy with threat talent in prot. Ur comment about tank dps only proves you have no knowledge about vanilla.
---
Sure level a feral, i will laugh at you while u sit outside the raid waiting for spot.
---
Warlocks are great for wPvP.  They can take on multiple enemies with ease once they're geared.  Mages will likely be over represented.  Also, warlocks beat mages lol.
---
There was a patch, so not a hotfix.
---
God... imagine what could have been
---
The funny part is you don’t even realize how unbelievably stupid you are trying to argue over this LOL
---
Yeah I've stayed away from certain zones and areas as to not spoiled it too much. But I had to play a little bit :/
---
Effect*
---
Slightly offtopic, while leveling is it ideal to tank main specing fury and offspecing prot?
---
That's what I thought with BFA, and legion, and wod etc :)
---
Haven't leveled a rogue, I'll try it after work if someone else doesn't beat me to it.
---
I remember thinking that place was so elite and high leveled and out of reach. I went there exploring as a low level and saw all these high level players with better gear. It was so awesome to arrive one day at the level to quest at there.
---
YES OMG YES. Imagine being able to search for "wow classic beta" and not get a million stupid thumbnails with a streamer making a stupid face.
---
Most alliance warriors will get their dal rends for pre bis. (Much easier to get that the rare epics)
---
Lol you had to opt into the Beta though. If you legit signed up and are now wasting the invite, we are all super disappointed in you
---
Do you even vanilla bro
---
to*
---
You couldn't run through players off the opposite faction in PvP.  So, tanks formed literal shield walls by standing side by side.
---
I fear both. I don’t want to be on Asmon or sodas, or any top 5 streamers server, but I want to steer clear from people like OP too.
---
So I'm sure this has been asked, but do you need an active subscription to be invited?
---
Priests will be more coveted than 1 per raid.  Even if they are, I love being the one person playing my class in a raid.  I feel extra special lol.
---
You are funny.
---
It's classic not a 'modern game' ... The whole point is to recreate the game as close to possible as it was.
---
Night elf MALE by far took the hardest blow, they literally couldn't ruin it better than this
---
Iirc SWTOR did something similar with Taunts reducing damage a player did to everyone else that wasn't the tank using them.  
---
Tanks could totally work better in PvP if devs thought a bit on how to do it.
---
Cool you are not you are salty :)
---
No idea. There was a blue post about nothing being transferable between classic and retail and one of the interviews from the summit that Esfand and company went to they said no wow tokens.
---
In addition to the other stuff said a fun 1 shot type rotation which will work on non plates or undergeared plates would be something like; cs, vanish, ambush, tea (or trinket), bs, evis, sapper. If you go fast you should be able to do it in one cs, but nothing wrong with popping tea and blinding or blinding after bs and resetting.
---
If everything crits it will almost always 1 shot except vs plates.
---
Yes because people stay away from warlock because :  
---
- Will of the Forsaken (Alliance only problem)  
---
- It's harder to do "well" compared to a mage  
---
- Pet micromanaging  
---
- Soulshard farming and 1 wasted bag slot  
---
- Your utility spells benefit others more than they benefit you  
---
But, with all the drawbacks, they are vastly underestimated, they can compete with mages and even beat them on longer fights, assuming healers help them when life tapping. They are the strongest 1v1 class without dispute, nothing can kill a skilled SL warlock. They have insane survivability AND no downtime.
---
Maxilagutta troll is total mad right now, has clinical depression irl and zero friends, lets make him and his micro D even more mad. Making salty tears since his birth. Salty Machine. Stop this madness man :D

People who violate the ToS don't get the middle ground, especially in a fucking Beta test. They aren't wasting time with people who violate the ToS.
---
People have NEVER been banned for what he's done. They've been disciplined if enough people complained yes, but not banned. That's because it isn't a violation of the ToS.
---
There's literally YEARS of examples of this in Vanilla AND retail WoW. No one has ever been banned for doing things like that. Not once. This argument has been had already so many times in the internet that there's practically case law for it at this point.
---
I went to school. Studied in Law and now work full-time at a court house dealing with more detailed and structured arguments you would buckle under in several seconds.
---
Double down some more. It's fun watching you jump through your mental gymnastics and keep thinking you're right when arguing on a subject thats been settled for literally a decade and a half.
---
Was it the lack of content for you?
---
For me it just felt buggy and... unsmooth. Like having permanent massiv lag. The secrets around the world were hard to distinguish from bugs. Same about the PvE. Mechanic or bug? Hard to say.
---
I don't, I played it long since closed beta. Kept hoping it will "get better", but the feeling of combat never matched WoW.
---
Classic was designed to run on today's toasters, so you can crank everything to max including ground clutter.
---
Mage is super fun in wPvP, especially the elemental fire/frost hybrid spec. Great burst, good AoE, lots of control and mobility, but very mana intensive.
---
Yeah. The nochanges assholes are preventing this and other things that don't affect actual gameplay that would certainly improve the game for better. I mean I'm still going to play but it would be cool to play 2019 graphics instead of 2004 graphics. Graphics have no affect on gameplay at all.
---
Or maybe he/other streamers aren't talking about it because it has *nothing to do with Classic WoW*. It's streamer drama, pure and simple.
---
&gt;  If not explained it will lead to even more drama which may affect the game  
---
No it won't.
---
Firstly, calm down gamer. Secondly, I was talking about the idea about them keeping it in after beta. I don't mind it being in beta, but I would prefer Blizzard not touch anything. I don't trust them with it.

We have to go deeper even if it means there is no coming back!

It's not hard to link a vid bro. In the time you've wasted replying to me multiple times you could have done so. I'm going with occam's razor here.

I am sure you could still clear the raids but they would be far more difficult you would have a lot of wipes on missed mechanics or people pulling aggro. I would think some of the easier raids you could still get through as long as those players without addons played carefully such as MC or ZG maybe even BWL although some mechanics in BWL can be unforgiving. Once you hit AQ-40 or Naxx you definitely need them though.
---
Having leveled MANY alts through Westfall for heritage armor, I am very very glad that I won't be seeing that stupid meme investigator or a bunch of homeless bums, or even partial fortifications.  Good fucking riddance.
---
Out of curiosity, what type of addon(s) are you hoping to build?
---
&gt; 10-20 S ( just vendor it ). I remember pretty well when of 6 hours of farming the spot, i just made the sh it outta 250 G    
---
That's 1250-2500 Iron Bars and Silk Cloth. Or 62-125 stacks of each. If anything you significantly under-made profit if you collected all of that. Which makes sense if you were vendoring it.
---
.. no?
---
This is what I remember too. I'd even get randoms sending tells while I was in a dungeon. "Hey after that do you want to tank for our group"
---
Between this and getting added to many friends lists. I never needed to wait very long after I logged in to get a group for a dungeon I needed.
---
Though I do remember waiting long times to find someone with an Ubers key while I was farming my (helm or chest) I forget which valor piece drops off drak
---
Age of Conan was the first one that I remember. I even played it for a while until realizing how awful the game was after you leave the "tutorial" island around level 20.

My dad had me farm on his account for him while he worked. To this day I have no idea what I was doing but it was a blast. I just know he told to me to only fight these certain mobs and press 1,2, then spam 3 til it died. Now that classic is coming out soon I get to farm for my own account
---
They are manually set at the start just so they have values. Once the addon handles the second OnUpdate event then everything should udate based on the player's weapons and range speeds with buffs taken into account.

It would be awesome if you wouldn't mind testing out some stuff. At the moment I'm nearly testing in production.

Mostly useful for kill credits or named monsters, less useful for having to loot items 'cougar paw' etc because then you're fighting with your own party for loot too.

Where did you learn this word, salty? Was in school or by some cool guy on the internet?

BUSTED
---
To be fair, as a healer you didn't need to see your character, only the bars. Park yourself in a safe place and wack the red bars.
---
Yeah i can see that.
---
If getting geared is a priority of yours I would consider Druid, they are historically quite underplayed and technically the "weakest" healer, but every raid will have a few for their buffs and utility and you'll have way less people to compete with over gear than Shamans and Priests especially.
---
Issue with grinding is losing the early easy reputation. As you out level quests rep diminishes as a reward. Reputation = discount, gold = hard.

I think the quit issue will affect warriors more than other classes because I think a large chunk of people eyeing warrior understand that they are top tier in PvP(with gear) and so want to choose "the best" but do not understand what that requires from them or at least won't respect the fact even if they know that.
---
I don't believe when you started your warrior you did so with visions of R14 warrior PvP on your mind.

31/5/15 this will be my spec unless somehow I end up MT. It was a great all round spec that let me OT in MC, BWL, AQ40. Tank dungeons and still operate in the open world. Pvp wasn't so bad either with a healer behind me.
---
Confirmed
---
So if someone farts in an elevator you turn around and scream at them that your world is ruined?
---
Understand that this moment will be fleeting, and that there is a hard crash of self-esteem to follow. You'll try to feed it again, and fill the void, but it will never be enough. 
---
You've backpeddled into the troll excuse. You have no point. You have no meaning. You have no significance. 
---
You will be forgotten
---
Not interested in getting to 40 in STVietnam?
---
Most people ban sl for duel tournaments because its a free win
---
People only now will realize how valuable this change is, I'm so glad we pushed for it
---
I levelled a warrior in vanilla wow.  Obviously I had no clue what I was doing.  My abiding memory of the experience is running away.
---
woo i'm famous.
---
That's a fancy green screen by the way.
---
I just went full Sherlock mode, look what I've discovered xD
---
&gt; Imagine being a grown ass man being salty about salty posts about STREAMING! HA HA HA. Dude

That was him, see  [yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/bdw2g6/na_vs_eu/el48rxo/?context=3)
---
Ah, I suppose if they too are Engineering they might purchase them. Then again they can farm Iron and it'd be a lot cheaper. Doesn't seem like it'd make much coin but... maybe it can anyways. Is there no cooldown on those?!
---
Shadow spec not good at endgame!?!?!?
---
I don't play Priest but whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
---
In both PvE and PvP Shadow was amazing.
---
Did they fix the stealth-walk animation as well?
---
I dont use DBM just because when I did every fight felt the same, move away, turn away, get adds. After I stopped using it everything feels a lot more unique and keeps me on my toes and really just feel a lot more immersed.
---
Omg classic is out on 90 days, what's next...
---
Games not even out yet.....
---
&gt; While leveling enhance is by far the best spec for a shaman
---
Oh thank god.  At least I'll get some fun out of it.
---
Now, as for staves... are you saying a staff over a Axe/Mace for Enhancement?  That's... odd, but I guess it makes sense.
---
And you don't even leave the homerow/natural hand position on a keyboard for typing.

:D :D TOTAL MAD PLEBERINO, do something useful. Delete this thread and move on with your life.
---
Just buff aspect of the beast, ez.
---
Sacking the same city for 2 years got boring. Yes.  I never had issues with lag tbh.
---
The issue is since retail and classic subscriptions are linked Tokens will essentially be in classic. Whats to stop someone from giving a person classic gold in exchange for a token in retail?
---
I think the ores stack in 10 if im not wrong, but the bars stack in 20, can someone prove me wrong?
---
They basicly have tanking talents and spec , the gear is the limitation for shaman tanking endgame
---
Want 100$?
---
Plus autoshots occuring during aimed shot casts and you can autoshot while moving.
---
no point to login but u saw a point to sign up on their website??
---
All those games had really good parts to them, and bad things of course. What kept me with WoW after playing those (you forgot SWtOR btw) was the buildup and lore investment. I was playing Warcraft titles for _years_ before WoW. WoW felt like...a dream almost after playing WC 2, 3 and FT
---
wont get beta anyway so i dont care anymore
---
They said that RP PVP servers will be added if their is demand for it. So if your into that kind of stuff. Start making posts on the forums so blizzard see the community want it.
---
Bro ... I am not a native english speaker I am so sorry for not speaking it perfectly but that you get triggered so brutally hard makes my day thank you
---
True, but for a fresh server Im ok with skipping out on that rep. For my alts Ill do the quest but when the server is just opened I want to get out of the crowd as quickly as possible.
---
clinical depression irl confirmed, get some help.
---
You’re either full of shit or a total moron.
---
"That's a lot of damage"
---
I’ve been taking my time with mine. I’ve been reporting bugs as I go but I feel like most of them have been already reported. Once I saw the arathi basin announcement, I’ve been rushing to 20 so I can play it haha.
---
Go for it!
---
Yeah but thats at Level 60 i dont think its that strong at 40 but we will see.
---
&gt;People who violate the ToS don't get the middle ground
---
The stupidity never stops with you does it? Blizzard has a history of finding the middle ground. The "ban all violations" behavior stopped in MoP.
---
Blizzard has a history of taking middle ground action including roll backs with no bans. Another example of middle ground is by temporarily muting a player in some channels and not in others.
---
All out bans are not the only solution to ToS violations. You are beyond stupid to assert as much. Such an assertion only proves just how weak of a grasp you have on the concept you are taking about.
---
&gt;I went to school. Studied in Law and now work full-time at a court house dealing with more detailed and structured arguments you would buckle under in several seconds.
---
Now we know why you're so mad I guess. You've worked hard only to find out that you are shitty at what you do. It really makes sense now. Watch out r/iamverysmart you have someone who is really shitty at their job coming in hot. 
---
&gt;People have NEVER been banned for what he's done. They've been disciplined if enough people complained yes, 
---
What are you even futily trying to argue at this point? Having action taken against you is definitive proof of a ToS violation. Players that are acting accordingly to the ToS do not have action taken against them. The very fact action was taken against the player proves that the ToS was violated. It is beyond moronic to suggest that players not in violation of the ToS would have action taken against them. This is really your peak point of stupid here. 
---
I mean christ what business do you have being a lawyer if you can't even understand the basics of ToS and actionable offenses? 
---
This takes your "laweryed" comment to an entirely different level. 
---
You really are a joke. 
---
Go back to school and become an accountant or something. This really isn't your thing.
---
&gt; The new models look better. 
---
Tell that to the poor innocent male nelfs who gave their lives for those new models.
---
I’d say Ignorance is Bis
---
Not even mentioning how fucking _amazing_ the lore around the Dwarf Ironbreaker is. I suggest everyone go google that Warhammer Lore tidbit
---
That server was so much fun. I still remember we had to form queues for quest items that just spawned on the ground, because so many people were online (like 20k). So people would just line up and wait their turn to loot.
---
Just ignore all that and wait three months? I've given your mom orgasms that lasted longer.
---
OHhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
---
(are mom jokes still a thing?)
---
This is such a stupid discussion. That's one of those questions that really revolves around pure nostalgia, because the old models look like shit with bad texture quality and low frame animations. If you show a comparison to anyone that haven't played vanilla they will without a doubt prefer the new models.
---
Gone since 5.1 for no reason, player feedback was ignored. Might change now, though.
---
The problem with improving character models is that the old armor models would stand out like a sore thumb so they would also need to be improved.
---
too thicc
---
I can already hear the music. Still torn between Warrior or Druid for my Tauren too.
---
so wait? we are no longer flying through mountains or clipping along the ground? what is this monstrosity?
---
You know, you might be right, I am pretty sure bars were up to 20 but now I'm doubting myself if the ores were too.
---
It's for the better, really. The ability to see everyone hiding in every corner of the flag room from a mile away was just bad.
---
You are not the sharpest tool in the shed are you?
---
Applemask was a beast. I never got to get into his BG team. The horde side if I remember correctly has 2-3 good pvp groups.
---
Figured, just messing with you ;). Also taking 3-4 weeks off. Wife wont make me lunch though... On the contrary she expects ME to do stuff since I'll be home "just playing games, anyway"! Will have to teach the oldest slave-child how to grind while I cook. And sleep.
---
The idea is not to enable voting for phases. 
---
Imagine Naxxramas is out for a long time and everyone pretty much farms it. Then players can vote if they want TBC expansion to release. If vote fails, repeat it after 6 months or so.
---
Initiating the vote could also be an in-game event that people have to complete first, a la AQ War Effort.
---
Earth Shock is high threat in vanilla, not Frost Shock.
---
Well damn, my wife is upset at me because I brought up the topic of buying a gaming rig to be able to play classic. God knows I'll need to be careful when it comes out to not lose her, pretty sure she hates the fact I enjoy gaming so much...
---
Bummer
---
my oldest is 14 turning 15. I started playing WoW because I was much more homebound once we started having kids. I have fond memories of WoW  classic and The Burning Crusade from that time period in my life.
---
Experiencing WoW Vanilla again with my kids along for the journey is going to be a thrilling experience.
---
Jaina and Bolvar are going to love this!
---
Yeah, those rules were really unnecessary.
---
Would be cool if blizz did something about that this time round. Or are they committed to releasing Classic exactly how it was balanced back in the day? i.e. Warriors being the only true viable tanks.
---
3 options right there to do instead of posting comments about reading books, playing games or rollerskate.
---
Does the Horde have problems with PvE like late game raids (since no paladin and racials that are better suited for PvP)? I’m going to play a mage and am really considering Undead because of the superior racial and Horde for being overall better at PvP, but I still want to progress in PvE as well.
---
Ok, so you don't want to race to 60. Good choice!
---
I have levelled toons to 60 with herbalism, skinning and mining. Herbalism is way easier to level than mining from my experience. Nothing worse than having to go back a zone to level up your mining because in your new zones all nodes are red. Never ran into that problem while picking flowers. Personally I'm not a huge fan of skinning on a rogue because I tend to focus more on humanoid mobs when having to grind.
---
If only gold is a concern I would go for herbalism and skinning. But you can also make a ton of gold while levelling with herbalism and alchemy. Alchemy is super easy to level and you get the huge benefit of making potions for yourself which I find absolutely crucial for a rogue. If you also level your fishing you will benefit even more from Alchemy (Oily Blackmouth, Stonescale Eel) although this becomes more relevant the more people PVP and raid.
---
You could also pick up mining and engineering for shits and giggles but making money of engineering is no easy feat.
---
So what made Nostalrius such a success? There were other vanilla pservers.
---
!RemindMe 80 days
---
Slowly
---
FF means streamers
---
Its like the BTTV browser addon for Twitch. It's not neccesary aor mandatory but it does enhance the viewing experiance.
---
Same thing when it comes to WoW addons.
---
Didn’t really put much thought into it and just signed up for it when it was announced.  After things settled a bit and I got my invite I realized there was no point to putting time into a character that was going to be deleted.  I’m not the biggest fan of the leveling process in Vanilla, so burnout is a real issue for me.  Absolutely love the end game though, and want to get atleast two chars to 60.  I’d be pretty bitter if I leveled a char to 40 (or higher) during beta and then had to do it all again for actual release.  I can find fun in it once, but I’d dread having to do it back to back.  So why kill the experience? 
---
I’m also opted in for the beta of all their games, and doubt I’d actually participate in any of those beyond the Diablo franchise either.
---
Maybe that feeling was ruined for me. By the long time it took for me to hit 70 one of my rich friends gave me the gold for it. My memory of how steep it was is ruined lol
---
I'd support this 100% tbh. 
---
But I dont think having different servers for each xpac is a good idea tbh. It would just divide the community too much imo. 
---
The only way i would see this work is if they closed the old server(s) and started a new one and i dont think people would like that either because they'd lose 2+ yrs of progression.
---
Want to play shadow priest for pvp, but also want to play shadow for pve. Is this feasible or just a foolish dream?
---
I'm torn between rogue and warlock. I used to main rogue in Vanilla and TBC and in WOTLK I changed to hunter. I was a total pleb with my rogue in Vanilla since I was so young and English isn't my native language so I didn't even completely understand the tooltips and such. 
---
In other hand I would really like to harness the actual power of a rogue in Vanilla but I'm also intrigued about warlocks. When playing hunter I really grew into like managing a pet. I'm aware that there is going to most likely be more rogues than warlocks but I don't really care about that. There is going to be a demand for skilled and social players no matter the class you play. I also kinda like to be a good player of a class which is considered as class for less skilled players. Then again I feel like warlock is the most undervalued class in Vanilla. 
---
Can anyone suggest which class is going to be more fun playing? I don't really shy away from farming Soul Shards (anyways I think that the farm is viewed as more of a struggle than it actually is). I'm going to be doing both PvE and PvP.
---
They changed the Deathcharger horse animation? Any detail on that?
---
&gt; You get upset by what other people find enjoyable? 
---
Really? You read that comment and thought that is was a real opinion?
---
Rockbiter is consistent and a constant AP boost, so I use it mainly while leveling. It's a alot nicer to rely on than 20% windfury procs, which while nice are also disappointing and a DPS loss if it never procs. 
---
Windfury if it's a low armor/cloth mob where I know if it procs, 80% of their hp is gone. Or for PvP and I need that burst. It's so nice that I can cast as elemental but also get in close with a dagger + WF and still get some melee damage in on them! 
---
For high armor mobs (high physical resistance) , I switch to flametongue or frostbrand because I found using rockbiter or windfury, that extra AP was just outright negated and I actually felt weaker.
---
And then there's ranks with level and talents, so just use whatever you think is best...based on what I mentioned above. If you go deep enhancement, 3/3 elemental weapons is nice for +20% rockbiter AP and +40% windfury AP and I believe +15% to FT and FB.
---
Honest as Abe Lincoln with a triple digit IQ and more common sense than I know what to do with.
---
Will do on alt :)
---
It's suboptimal but certainly fun!
---
i like to bring up the example of OSRS and RS3 models (disclaimer: i mainly play rs3 and enjoy it more), the theme and models in rs3 look "objectivelly" better, but the OSRS models look way more coherent with everything else in the game while the RS3 models look way out of place with the rest of the game.
---
Sure
---
I've been subbed since the beta was announced.

---
Sm ruin is a good all rounder for all content. 
---
Ds ruin will outperform sm ruin in pure raid fights. Anyone that says otherwise doesnt know enough. 
---
In terms of pvp the SL build probably what you want to be rolling as it’s the only build that doesn’t make warlocks get slapped around like a wet noodle.
---
Tester like you do us proud!
---
Are you that skinny angry guy?

Talking strictly PVE here. Shadow's not amazing at all. It's okay, but not great. There might be 1 per raid, *maybe* 2, in prog guilds.

Dinged 60 back in the day in Winterspring, grinding yetis. Plan to do the same this time around. Favorite zone for sure. It's like a better Dun Morogh.
---
Oo kk.  I couldn't remember if that started at 1.12 or in TBC.
---
I can relive the 2 fps ironforge days
---
Shit, I better invest in some good bags early on then.
---
In general you'll outlevel the professions around the mid 20's/30's, I think I tried this on an alt, and even with some reinforcement of mats from the main, I was still only around skill level 200 when I hit 60. Totally doable, but the materials required ramp up significantly once you hit a certain point.
---
It's viable for alliance too. Better for horde, but does good enough damage to do as alliance. Proofs (private server footage, but should be very similar in retail):

 Arathi is the BEST area to get those irons. I Remember a Cave alone, with 20 min cd or so, with like 7-8 nodes inside of it no time
---
Dont bother arguing with these people. The fact he uses mainstream as some devaluing description should tell you everything you need to know.
---
Just do what YOU have fun with!
---
On my very first toon I had tailoring and enchanting, kind of costly and time consuming to level but I loved crafted myself blue gear. Having fond memories of farming spiders in Duskwood to be able to craft Spidersilk boots.
---
I won't be doing it this time around though because the better gear is kind of not worth it to me for the time I would have to invest into levelling a crafting profession for gear that might only last me few days of /played time.
---
What do you mean by main spec and offspec? You have 1 talent spec at a time in Classic.
---
If by mad u mean laughing out loud then sure!
---
That's what classic is all about, the adventure! 
---
I'm planing to do something like this, later down the line. 
---
The release and main char will be rushed and no lifed
---
Hell are you talking about? I said streamers constantly say “these values are different on private servers” all the time, which they do. Granted they do it a lot less now, but the first 2 weeks of beta was literally every 5 minutes. Also you quoted something I never even said lmao, so WHO is making up stuff? You.
---
My whole point is that it’s fucking retarded to compare private servers to actual validated classic wow.
---
You can tank in a DPS spec until 60. Not worth doing prot when even non-tank classes are viable for dungeons.
---
I believe a "Goteeeem" is in order.
---
I may be mistaken here, but I leveled a pala to 60 specd ret the whole time back on Nostalrius. I would use seal of the crusader first to judge the mob, then use seal of command and judge further on cool down. Seal of the crusader judgement increases holy damage taken by the mob, and seal of command extra damage is holy if I remember correctly. 
---
Not conflicting with your comment at all, but that's what I remember doing back in the day and I'm not sure if the extra +holy damage was better than opening with a SoC judgement. Either way, to answer OP: I enjoyed leveling as ret. It was slow and a lot of the same, but fun for sure!
---
Hi not sure if the extra +holy damage was better than opening with a soc judgement. either way, to answer op: i enjoyed leveling as ret. it was slow and a lot of the same, but fun for sure!, I'm dad.
---
Some guilds will have actual shadow priests for PvE.  A majority will have someone around for shadoweaving at the very least.  Keep in mind it is likely only to be 1 per guild so your chances aren't super great but not impossible either.
---
IMO. If classic does well I don't think they'll abandon retail. But very classic like features might get re-introduced to new expansions.
---
The only way classic 1.13 happens is every literally everyone plays classic, and relatively no one plays retail. Blizzard will be forced to drop one for the other. I find this highly unlikely.
---
And how will you do that exactly?
---
1 spot in a 40 man raid :D If you get a guild pre launch and you get the spot - why not.
---
You need double marriage training for that, the license is like 10K gold..
---
he posted his Robin Hood earnings on wsb earlier today
---
&gt;things like Ony/Nef head
---
Lemme get that beta
---
I had the Cata beta and wasn't thrilled knowing I needed to level twice. It's fun but it's hard to lose it all.
---
But Zin'rokh is a hunter weapon. OEB and BRE are way better then it for a warrior/paladin.
---
The issue is true, but your example doesn't consider gnomes who can be mages.
---
Depends what kinda pvp and pve you're doing. I assume that you dont want to respec for raids? In that case, you probably dont want to be raiding with an efficient guild and therefore SM/Ruin is your best and only pick.
---
If you do want to respec, a WPVP spec fully depends on your playstyle. All three specs have some niche strengths but are on a similar level. SL is strong for tanking melees in up to a 3v1 situation depending on your gear. SM/ruin is a great all rounder but squishy against melee. Should destroy all casters simply by outbursting. As conflag you have to cast the most, which means that you might struggle against melees but with high crit % you'll be bursting any class with an immolate conflag shadowburn combo to near 0%.
---
In premade pvp, sm/ruin is your best spec for early vanilla WSG due to lack of crit gear. For AB, you should be playing SL if you're assigned to anchor a base and SM/ruin or conflag if fighting. As you progress in gear and therefore crit, conflag should be the default for WSG.
---
Because people were making far too much of an issue out of this because blizzard took action on a beta
---
They compared. Never cried or said blizzard is wrong because x. Never happened
---
Pretty sure Horde managed to down Kel'Thuzad 15ish years ago, so no reason they can't do it now.  Might just not be quite as easy.
---
Would have appreciated a spoiler tag on this. :(
---
I only need tailoring for the healing robe, so would you reccomend waiting until 60 to start leveling tailoring, before replacing it?
---
You are are fixated with other mens genitalia.
---
I really don't think a lot of people are going to buy WoW tokens from one another. It's not convenient like the real token, and it's not safe. You'd have to trust another player with *real world money* (or a pile of gold) as they log off to swap characters and you hope they log back on for the trade. Sure, you could report them if they scam, but Blizzard is notorious for not always being able to recover things lost in trade scams. Will there be people who do it? Sure. But not nearly close to the amount of people who sell tokens currently.
---
Either way, what's to stop someone from paying gold for a carry through Naxx? They're both exchanges of time for gold. These things will happen no matter how much we don't want them to.
---
That's fair. I would justify it with the simple notion that if it's among your favorite pastimes, it's worth being able to do it well.
---
I don't know about their overall performance as I tend to build my own PC and don't use laptops, but NVIDIA for example was advertising their laptops. These things seem like they might even run VR and many models were $700-$1000, which seems like a fantastic buy. You could build a gaming PC for less, but if laptops are a thing they might not be a bad option. Pending research, of course - I don't want to lead people astray here. lol
---
Can we please get rid of these cancer streamer videos
---
Gnomes were a mistake. But you are right.
---
Horde claimed most of the world first kills the first time around in Vanilla. Despite the imbalance between the two factions, they're both pretty competitive.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Ok so you are between 20-25y old. Is there any other private info you want to share?
---
We're putting the band back together! It'll work this time i promise!!
---
This isn’t something restricted to only reddit. Most the complaining is done on other platforms. Also reddit is mostly biased since the majority of people here played on private.
---
Oh yes youre right, i just came back to wow after 6 years and forgot all about the token..
---
&gt;  My Parents and Sister had taken off on Holidays, I told them I couldn't get the time off work to go with them, I did get the time off but Burning Crusade was just released and there was no way I was going to miss that.
---
Hah, I knew it!
---
I would stick with shammy then.  Might take a while to get the gear but you will get it eventually and shamans are crazy needed on horde.
---
You said it had zero impact. But when you wrote zero impact it no longer was zero.
---
Lonely?
---
Top vanilla guilds roll as many if not more warlocks than mages that's 4-6 spots, and there's twice the population of mages. Compared to other dps classes, they are much more sought after, because they are underplayed.
---
Thanks for the list. Yeah I'd like to see Blizz check these on the reference client.
---
I mean, obviously the artistry and cohesion is more important than pixel count.
---
That said, I'd love the opportunity to be overwhelmed and awestruck by the "world of warcraft" again. And a new engine plus a new take on the old zones could definitely do that (or not, *cough, cough* Cata-WoD).
---
Well met!
---
This is just another dipshit who cleaned the dust of his abandoned alt just to talk shit like this don’t worry
---
If you enjoy healing, you'll love the shaman gameplay once you have a bit of raid gear. Chain heal spam is pretty satisfying, especially early on when you're competing with priests and prayer of healing to top meters (spoiler alert, shamans win because of smart heals). 
---
tl;dr shaman healing in vanilla made me love healing - roll shaman.
---
Aha yes, let me explain.
---
I was trolling a dude. Had no idea where I was posting.
---
All priests will get the eye eventually.  When it is introduced I think it is like a 50% drop rate (either eye or leaf drops every week).  I honestly raided as disc/holy priest and also PvPed as that.  I do however actually like healing in BGs and playing the survival game while my overgeared warrior guildies just massacre everyone.
---
This little actions adds so much flavour, it makes the gryphon/wyvern feels more like a living animal rather than just a lifeless vehicle like in retail.
---
For leveling judging crusader on a mob isnt worth it unless the fight lasts longer than a minute, which isnt very often. Hell, judging command is hardly worth it, as using rank 1 SoC doest the same damage.  In raids you wont get to judge crusader as its a wasted debuff slot. In dungeons its great.
---
Earthen golem totem is not a thing in vanilla. And As far ac CC goes they have none, except slows.
---
Blessedly, launch starts at 6 PM my time, so I won't be too far behind. My plan is to just take my time enjoying Teldrassil, punching things in the face and let the initial crowd filter out.
---
101 dollars?
---
Hi!
---
Thanks for the detailed write-up! You raised some very good points that I will keep in mind.
---
Waifu2x is not a problem, just had a look at it and the CLI is easy enough to use. The redrawing also does not scare me too much (one of my jobs in the past when I was still doing scanlations).
---
I will see how it goes and report back!
---
Fuck yeah
---
Did you mean irony?
---
Let me innnnn
---
Basically what happenend is
---
Your past self made a troll post, about trolling your future self, which i hope is trolling!! Otherwise I feel sad for you.
---
Bias towards the Alliance much?
---
A tricky one. On private servers there are AQ/Naxx guilds who allow one shadow priest into the raid for the shadow weaving debuff, but the argument against is that a priest can take shadow weaving without going all the way down into deep shadow. Expect resentment if your guild doesn't have enough healers online for their raid and you're standing there in shadow spec.
---
If you get to 60 and find you can't get in a raid, would you consider a disc spec for PVP and PVE? You'll be even more important in group PVP and still able to wPVP plus you'll have an easier time getting a raid spot as you'll bring more utility.
---
I'm expecting to PVP as a [tri-spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbezzZVMgzzt) at 60 and am expecting to have an easier time getting into raids than if I was full shadow since I can debuff the boss and still heal. In group PVP I'll be a bigger headache for alliance than if I was full shadow spec, though I will probably miss the 1v1 domination that shadow can offer.
---
Personally I think Shaman is the most fun, but I'm playing Alliance this time. Shaman just have so many tools. Self res, ghost wolf, and astral recall are so hard to say no to while leveling. Especially astral recall. The 60 min CD on hearthstone hurts. 
---
If I was going Horde, I'd play Shaman. 
---
Priest has the most fleshed out kit. So I you want to be the most versatile healer who has an answer for every kind of situation, that's my choice.
---
Yeah sure. The night elf female made out of polygons. And probably the worst human female character possible to make.
---
Yeah like as rogue you simply can spare 5 points on improved stealth stuff
---
Man if I wanted 3 months vacation I'd have to just quit.
---
They are actually keeping a few bugs from back then for just that purpose tho.
---
Do you even use shield for low level tanking btw? Or just go 2hander def stance?
---
This interface takes me back!
---
It was and it is super fun. Check out  [https://www.returnofreckoning.com/](https://www.returnofreckoning.com/)  it's Warhammer Online private server with active playerbase/dev. I'm spending every spare minute of my life with this awesome game while waiting for Classic :) It honestly is one of the better MMOs out there even though it's a private server.
---
Druid is great dungeon healer and can do some funky things with it's non-healing spells and even shapeshift to bear to save situations. Also with a strong group you can use hurricane to really speed clearing up. I also love the quality of life having stealth on demand and group questing you can heal, damage or tank.
---
Very versatile, high skill ceiling and giving out Marks of the Wild is the best. Travel form is cool and instant cast, crazy escape potential in watery areas (even shallower rivers etc.) with aquatic form.
---
Also there tends to be so few druids that you'll always be the cool dude in leveling areas handing out Hotw and throwing some bro heals on the go. Druid feels more mythical creature than a priest for example. Tauren Druid is the chillest adventurer out there dude.
---
I know this is some special snowflake kinda shit, but I just like the idea of a Druid a lot.
---
soooo delighted
---
Who from what?
---
The trick is to not craft the most ressource efficient recipes but rather useful ones. There will be tons of players looking for some decent upgrades that you can provide. Craft and sell those. And then buy more ressources.
---
Agree fNE looks horrible in retail, but mNE got way better imho.
---
I actually enjoy the look of mNE enough to play it, armor looks better on them etc. Classic I cant stand the males sadly. I still love rolling fem NE in classic but i've done it so many times now I kinda wish male looked better
---
about tree-fiddy
---
Ah you were only pretending to be retarded, the joke must be on us
---
Both would be fun. Are you going to focus pvp or pve? With either class, they can perform well. 
---
Personally I would pick warlock but that was my main in vanilla till mop. You can solo quest easily, utility is muchly appreciated by groups, fear is op in vanilla.
---
Huh?
---
Yay, more stupid meme's for this sub!
---
Just look at the front page and it is 80% bs posts like this.
---
Good job Mods!!
---
If it is a cluster I might walk a few characters to the nearest Inn for some rested bonus, if I understand it correctly. Then when I'm ready hearth back to starting zone.
---
&gt; Only the most tryhard guilds will require world buffs

&gt; Only the most tryhard guilds will require things like Ony/Nef head

And the heads were never the most annoying part - in fact it's the simplest part.
---
It was dead with the firemarshall zones. too many people in an area. toon runs against an invisible zone wall preventing them from joining the fight.
---
It's a scare-tactic "the community" regurgitates all the time. "oh no, there is a clock under my mini-map!!! whats next? group finder, RrrRaahhhhh!" 
---
There is an enormous difference between MINOR QOL additions/tweaks (colorblind modes, graphics toggle, sending multiple items in mail, see-through menus, CLOCK UNDER MINI-MAP, etc.) and fundamental/philosophical changes to the core game-play experience, such as raid finder, group finder, re-balancing specs, sharding/phasing, flying mounts, quest helpers, etc.
---
The point is, your argument is absurd because you basically drew a comparison between a mini-map clock and re-balancing. 
---
Furthermore, if what I said was interpreted as "lashing out like a child," you must have really read that out loud with some gusto! Besides, I was trying to reach you on your level. 
---
...and I never mentioned or implied that Blizzard hasn't made some major fuck ups with their games in the past, so your last statement is... i don't know, irrelevant?
---
WOWBFA sucks, WOWC gonna kill it.
---
Well, it is an amateur work using unity store assets. As a proof of concept it gets the job done imho.
---
If blizz took a crack at it I'm sure the slightly-cartoony and charm-filled art style could be maintained properly.
---
It'd be a long term project, but definitely interesting.
---
Warhammer Online spirit lives:  [https://www.returnofreckoning.com/](https://www.returnofreckoning.com/)  \- private server with active devs and playerbase. One of the better MMOs I've ever played. Playing this actively while waiting for WoW classic.
---
Although i do agree that part of a stealth class should be not getting caught before you open, even with a free opener stealth classes didn’t make it past the top 8 even iirc, so it hardly mattered at level 30.
---
Well Im laughing out loud. Do you guys honestly take these things serious?
---
True - I remember being able to sell armor kits early on when I first leveled my Shaman in vanilla (my first toon). I'll have to research some stuff and see what patterns might make sense this time around.
---
Mmmmm. Nachos....
---
Wow that makes sense...thats why it isnt going to happen. Do you have a link?
---
I'm not affected by the burn-out or the fact that'll I'll lose my progress, when your just having fun playing, then that's all you need. If you view it as a grind that's not fun, then that's unfortunate. Plus, the level 30 cap, and now the lvl 40 cap allow for players to experience meta's that wouldn't normally exist and there a whole lot of fun in that itself.
---
Point is, do what is fun to you :) I haven't really played since vanilla/wrath but have recently level to 54 on pserver and level 30 soon to be 40 on beta. It's been a blast and I can't wait to do it all again, with multiple char on release.
---
Thank god
---
1 dmg for every UI element on the screen.
---
I think back to when WoW first released and I got into the beta. I feel like that tease / excitement prevented me from really sticking with 1 character and grinding to 60 right off the bat. I was an alt-aholic early on because I was young and undisciplined but also because I was chasing that "exploratory beta vibe".
---
This August 27th will be different. No sleep till 60. And by that I mean I'll be a filthy casual and will be 60 by like November...
---
Warrior is fun when you get decent weapons. You are going to be very gear dependent, so the obvious thing to consider is that your potential to kill things is directly proportional to how good your gear is. 
---
That being said, there are plenty of blues that will let you hit hard, and the dungeon armor sets aren't that bad all things considered. Back when vanilla was current, I was in 5-man dungeon blues (1.9-1.12 stats, gear for stamina/crit/str/ap) and I could beat  my server's grand marshal rogue in duels sometimes. Things really ramped up once I got an epic 2 hander though. 
---
You'll be plenty competitive in BWL gear if your guild can clear that instance.
---
This would only mean that he falls even further "behind". So your post makes no sense.
---
For the last time, your sister isn't your wife
---
I'll skip the blue gear and instead make cheapest greens I can with all cloths so I can disenchant them. All I want is unlock my mooncloth cd and get mats for leveling enchanting
---
It's right there on the note silly goose, they are Jurassic
---
Yeah it was weird for me since I can read some tieng Viet and was able to understand all of that. Took me a moment to realise since I was not expecting to see any here.
---
&gt; !remindme 82 days

You're still willfully ignoring what I'm saying here just to try and claim I'm wrong, so I'll go ahead and block you now.
---
PANZERKAMPFWAGEN ACHT!

You dont need a shield until 40, once things start being balanced around punching plate
---
More than literal lag, was how the combat was set. For example, jumpshots (jump, turn, instant, turn, keep running) were impossible to do in the game. The animations also gave the feeling of lagging/sliding.
---
Personal taste maybe, but the combat of wow just felt much more agile back then.
---
He doesnt. What makes you think that?
---
Wasn't exactly Vanilla but in WotLK when my baby brother wanted to play I showed him how to farm herbs. He was maybe like 6 or 7 back then. When I went out with my friends he always wanted to play. And always I had quite nice amount of herbs when I next time logged in.
---
Currently having 9 year old son.. so maybe history will repeat itself..
---
I see what you are saying about the risks but that didn't stop people from buying gold from gold sellers in vanilla.  There will be a demand for easy gold in classic and people will try to fill that demand.  
---
Yes you are absolutely right these things Will happen no matter if we want them to or not but it would be beneficial to us if the community brought it to Blizzards attention and they made a statement about how they would handle this type of thing.
---
What will you do now? Cry salty tears?
---
Making bags is always nice, and later level clothes can be made into bolts to condense the bag space they take up some.
---
!Remindme 82 days
---
Yes this was the story for every raid healer back then.  Haha
---
Who is mad though?
---
They used cata SW and Ogrimar.
---
Youre absolutely right the streamers are alot more under populated than the rest of the community, nor do I care so much that they got beta. I just wish blizz wouldve been honest about inviting all the streamers and wanting free publicity/advertising over others that imo deserve it more or would actually report bugs.
---
My bad - this should have said "the primary gearing goal during leveling should be leveling more efficiently".
---
I got 2 weeks off, but more power to you bro.
---
What you suggest needs even more resources than levelling efficently. He will level his blacksmithing even slower then so the level gap between his character and the gear he can craft gets even bigger.
---
You realize there aren't some finite amount of keys for Blizzard to give out right?  They keep the population where they want it and decide to give out more when they need to increase it.  Those keys are distributed like they said.  Any streamer getting in for publicity isn't taking away a key from someone else, they're just getting in on top of what Blizzard has already invited.
---
rule #1 if the interwebz. Screenshot or never happened.

Fuck, communication is needed? In a team game? Where has the world gone?

Here is a secret. I actually don't. I just wanted to have a little fun on my troll account. Thanks! But don't tell anyone.
---
You missed Perplexity and Monkeynews, just to name a few, who spent 10+ hours a day testing various of things, from themselves and viewers? 
---
On top of that, streamers playing the game and get other people to play the game as well, through duel tournaments, dungeons and what not, is testing as well. Just because you get a beta invite, you don't have to commit your way of playing to that. You can play however you want and Blizzard will take whatever information you give them, and use it.
---
I feel like people are trying too hard at faulting people with no mechanical skill or knowledge, like Asmongold, Tipsout and various other streamers for just doing what they do best: Rake in viewers and making the game popular.
---
Lol... Your a joke. Dont you see that you got destroyed? What is dead may never die. But your arguments are buried and im now eating pie after
---
I want to play a Hunter because I genuinely was enjoying the game play during th stress test but people say they are terrible at DPS in raids?
---
Also how are they with PVP?
---
But then what are moms for?
---
Most of the quest turn ins I did were for level 29 and below dungeons and what not. Have not touched  arathi or stv. Hit 31 without a lot of work. Didn’t get to play as much as I wanted to. Damn adulting. If I didn’t have the “job” I’d be in my mid 30s by now...
---
If you are interested in seeing *most* raid content (Ony, MC, and as much BWL as possible) but don't mind if it takes a little longer (read: one night per week starting sometime after Jan. 1st) during hours that are **CT and MT friendly** (currently thinking 8:30 CT +/- 30 min), please comment here and send me a PM. We might need to take it upon ourselves to make something happen.
---
0.02 Drop rate on PoD. Who ever ends up getting it is going to be god tier. We are going to see a lot of Uld farming this beta run.
---
I'd love to recreate VVJ Volksfront der Judäa (german People's Front of Judea from Life of Brian). Was a fun name, chill guys just playing for fun back on the Tirion server. Last thing I heared is they had to rename themself because some idiot thought the name was offending.  
---
Let's see if it's doable in this day &amp; age xD
---
Thats the same shitty stuff Cataclism did, I’d hate to see the old stuff change, I’d much more prefer If they added new stuff/finished unfinished zones.
---
Nothing against you OP but Blizzard should monitor game played at this point for beta account. Remove beta access to people with level 10 and under, then redo a round of invites with these beta.
---
It seems a bit over the top but the goal of a beta is testing and reporting bugs to deliver a better product.
---
Lok'tAr OgART
---
&gt; Or are they committed to releasing Classic exactly how it was balanced back in the day?
---
pretty much, because otherwise the #nochanges dipshits will lose their fucking minds.
---
If you're level sixty you have far more profitable ventures accessible to you than farming iron, as for a long time there will be a large influx of cheap iron from people farming it while they level. 
---
The cooldown is one minute, so you can go through a lot of them.
---
SL Lock wins pretty much vs everything in a 60 1v1 on equal skilllevel
---
My old guild was called &lt;THRALLZ BALLZ&gt;, and our tabard was a ball suspended on two chains.  A GM made us change it because it was "innappropriate".
---
Fast-forward to Cataclysm, and the NPCs actually use "THRALLS BALLS!" as an exclamation in their dialogue.  SMH.
---
Gas chamber gaming
---
Wait what? Are people actually taking me serious? Im a sarcastic troll meister.
---
As far as race orcs are a proud warrior race with a strong sense of honor, family, and strength. 
---
On the other hand tanking is the roll I play in most games, the idea of ragnoros swinging his hammer at me and remaining standing sounds really BA
---
I am not a native English speaker if that is what you think:) my only point was that since English is the preferred language of everyone else, local servers in other languages are great for everyone. Germans are definitely the best out of the nation's that have a lot of localization in terms of english, I've met many that speaks English without me having any issue of understanding them or they understanding me. But I've met many who are the opposite too.
---
Personal anecdote is when I was in Berlin 10 years ago, nobody in stores, cafes, bars etc spoke a word of english. Had to resign to sign language for the most part. Albeit I'd guess the younger generation is way better in English than the 30+ ones.
---
Who are you?
---
I'm curious to how my experience will be. I played vanilla as a clueless 15 year old who didn't even know what min-maxing was. Returning with 14 years of experience is bound to make this different, for better or worse.
---
I just hope I never group up with a healer who only uses wand again (Literally no heals or spells at all).
---
That's my well known secret when I wanted to do realm first's (rift, warhammer, AA, etc). Don't initially play the first 6 or so hours and just play at night.. too bad I can't do that this time around due to my work schedule.
---
&lt;it's a secret&gt;
---
Thanks man
---
My preferred classes are paladin, priest, druid and mage, followed by warlock and shaman, with hunter, rogue and warrior bringing up the rear. 
---
With that in mind, what class should I play on a PVP realm when I SUUUUUCK at PVP?
---
Ok thanks for letting me know. I feel better now.
---
Druids aren't innervate slaves anymore than Warlocks are summon/stone/curse slaves. Or hunters being kiting and tranq slaves.
---
Some classes provide slightly less value per second in exchange for utility. Druids provide that with innervate and battle res.
---
They're mana efficient healers and they're actually good at it despite what reddit says.
---
was simply incorrect, but ok, guess I was annoying
---
I think one of the main argument for rogues everyone seems to have, is everyone plays one so if you want to raid getting a spot you might get turned down. As far as PvP rogues come off as being the master of PvP, but I truly think mages are better in PvP than rogues but then again both are great and your play style depends.   
---
If your main focus is PvP for everything, then engineering usually goes hand to hand with PvP.  
---
For the race, play whatever you want, I think some people say and I could be wrong "GO GNOME" because "They're harder to click on", I've never been in a situation where I couldn't click on a gnome because he's too small. But then again I'm a Tab player anyways  
---
Raiding, you're going to be a frost mage. Everyone loves mages, and everyone wants a frost mage in their raid. Trust me, you're not getting into Molten Core as a fire mage.   
---
When it comes to cloth classes like Mages, priest, and warlocks I'm a stickler for Alchemy and Herb, or Tailoring and enchanting, both are great. I like Alchemy the most out of the rest.
---
1. Sword and Board and /pray for a Thunderfury. Thunderclap is useless for dps.
---
Played MT for vanilla + tbc and during vanilla I just didnt farm on my warrior. With TF its ok, but without - I'd recommend not even leaving the city if its not for traveling to raids/dungeons. Leveling an alt with the gathering professions you need is more fun, even if it takes forever. Riding around with a decked out warrior in protspec to grind/gather is like driving an offroad monster in first gear on the highway. Just makes you want to kill yourself :p
---
Here it comes, my response! Hold on!
---
I'm 100% with you though it may have depended on the server.
---
If you were waiting a long time for one role it was tank.  If not 9/10 times at least 8/10. 
---
Also honestly, people worrying about loot competition was a lot rarer in Vanilla.  ...Then again I played a mage and it seemed like people who did make a fuss about loot competition were generally rogues and warriors.
---
TBC it was even easier to find tanks since you had more options although depending on community it may had taken a long time for the stigma to change on the other tanking specs.  I know Prot Pallys were looked down on for awhile at the start but as a mage I quickly started to prefer them since they were so much better at AoE threat(and one of our main raiders was one).
---
Was wondering where those new followers were coming from, thanks!
---
I probably wouldn't have felt like this just a few years ago, but with Blizzards recent record I just don't trust them to not go too far. So I get what you mean by the big jump, but I have seen it happen in their past games, and I don't want that for Classic.
---
There are addons that can use the blizz ui look. Details damage meter and weakauras come to mind. Weakauras takes some setting up though to get just right.
---
Already a post on the forums calling for one.
---
So if you want RP PVP, head there and add your support to the post. The more the merrier. 
---
If blizzard doesn’t add one, most in the post agree that we’ll all roll on one PVP server and claim it as our own.
---
I’d be fine with new content ( finishing missing / unfinished zones - hyjal, azshara, uldum etc ) or TBC content without flying.
---
Hunters are great at pvp. They do good damage in MC and BWL but completely fall off the charts in AQ and Naxx, but you need 1-2 per raid for tranq shot and pulling so if your competent and reliable you'll get a raid spot. They are great at farming too, solo DM tribute and mara runs for example.
---
Its so trivial it's not worth mentioning
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Or just gauge activity and send more invites if necessary? There's no reason to remove access for anyone lol
---
I heard a streamer talk about leveling a shaman. Do you know what he said? He said that he had never had to drink for mana as a healer in dungeons. Let that sink in for a while.
---
Dangit monster
---
Honestly I upvoted because of your comment :)
---
Welcome to Vanilla!
---
Again? [The hell is it doing here now?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
---
wtf dude o.0
---
40 is it y'all
---
This is fkn awesome, man. GJ!
---
Or use QWE to run and strafe. Asd free for keybinds.
---
You are proving my point because all the stuff you just described is not what the streamers groups consist of.
---
Yes, hunters can benefit from spirit but spirit gear is not BIS for a dungeon/raid specced hunter.  Any shaman spec  *could* heal but dedicated healing specs made dungeons easier, and all the streamers' groups have dedicated healers.  Sap point was moot because sap talents had changed by 1.12 I think.
---
Also most people did (and will) run dungeons while under leveled.  Like I saw that one streamer (with a group full of lvl 30  BIS twinks) commenting that SFK "felt kind of easy".  The final boss is like lvl 26, and I'm pretty certain I ran SFK at lvl 18 or 19 in Vanilla a few times.
---
So Vanilla dungeons were never "hard", but they were very rarely as easy as they appear in beta streamers videos.  Your group's level, gear, skill, and coordination often made dungeons much more difficult.
---
Oh people still definitely bought gold in vanilla, but you have to admit that far, *far* more people buy gold through tokens. It's a simple button press now, and it's endorsed by the game itself. Absolutely no risk.
---
I'm sure the same people who bought gold in vanilla will do it again in Classic, but perhaps Blizzard will crack down on that harder. You risk losing all of your characters when you buy gold, and most people aren't willing to do that.
---
As for trading tokens, is that really something they can ban people for though? It comes really close to the Naxx example. And again not a lot of people will be willing to risk trusting a stranger.
---
How would you want them to handle it anyway?
---
RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL, RUN AWAAAAAYYYY
---
is it okay if i'm not very experienced with wow? it's something i kinda missed out on when i was younger, but have the chance to get into now.
---
Yeah I farmed them in Cata and got both binding in the same run and then the Eye of Sulfurus all in 2 or 3 months of farming. They look pretty badass dual wielded.
---
Ah, yes, the very old super secret Stormwind Harbor that was well hidden until Cataclysm
---
TBH, people are taking the whole "Tanking in vanilla was almost impossible" stance a bit to far. 
---
Things you MUST do when tanking imo. (Comming from a main priest with warrior alt that both cleared MC and most of BWL in a casual/social raiding guild).
---
1: Before you pull a group, you mark a skull, a cross, and a star/whatever for sheep/Shacle etc. I literally do this even in DM, just to get into the habbit of it, and to explain how it works to others, so they learn to also do this)
---
2: You pull--&gt;blood rage (or charge in to pull), battle shout, get 2 sunders on skull, then start getting sunders on the rest so your healer doesn't pull agro. 
---
3: You keep tab targetting, and hitting them with sunders/revenge when you can, shield bash to interrupt, and shield wall to save your healer some mana.
---
Before you pull next pack, check healers mana, if +50%, i keep pulling. If under 50% i usualy ask. When its a guildie, or a person i know, i've told them to just /w me when they need a break and this sometimes leads to me pulling even when they are on 10% :P
---
Bosses are mostly easyer as a tank, as you usualy only have 1 BOSS and maybe 1-2 adds to worry about.
---
Do that, and you are already a decent tank. The good tank then also looks out of adds, changes the marks are situations force him to, might pull another pack, before the last one is down, to keep momentum up, but not to fast to drain everyones mana. Will charge mobs that go for the healer even before they get to them etc.
---
and the Awsome warriors alsways have food buffs up, use dragonbreath chilly for easyer agro, know every pull in every dungeon by heart and wear goldlike gear.
---
And you dont need to lvl as prot.. it will gimp you outside dungeons way to much.
---
They are terrible dps in raids, yes, and there's no getting around that. You also only take 1 hunter for tranq shot, and there's a lot of hunters competing for that 1 spot. In earlier raids or casual guilds, you can probably get in and dps, but you have to struggle a lot and do a perfect rotation to do less damage than mages and warlocks that press 1 button or warriors and rogues.  
---
PvP-wise, they're great if you get the drop on people or if you have room to kite and abuse the 41 yard range, if they get into melee and you're out of escape options, you're dead. They're not great for 1v1, but they're really fun in bg's and wpvp, but even there deadzone can be extremely frustrating.
---
Looks amazing. Definitely downloaded it, and will use it when classic comes out. I actually made a reminder to update it when classic is out to get the latest version.
---
So... you didnt understand the post at all?   
---
The point is to invest the extra materials to ensure that whatever you craft can be sold for a worthy sum. If you could craft 6 belts for 5 bars or 5 boots for 6 bars each, the most efficient way would obviously be crafting belts. However what if those boots sell for a healthy sum while the belts need to be vendored. So you rather craft the boots and reinvest the gold to craft more boots.   
---
Thats the concept. And yes, due to how sparse good upgrades from quests are, the demand heavily varies between different items.
---
If you want a nieche healing class with a lot of utility shaman might be the class for you! Priest excell at single target healing, while shaman is utsed for utility and chain heal. Also is priest such a common class? As i understand it healers, regardless of class are pretty sought after compared to other classes except maybe tanks.
---
not once did I say 5 drops an hour! But all the other BOEs, cloth, vendor trash - when you are the only one in the instance, does add up to 40-50g an hour, IF you get some defias gear.  And yes they DID sell for that in vanilla. Twinking from 10-19 WGS was huge in vanilla. Folk were dropping hundreds of gold twinking out their rogues/hunters. 
---
Even if they didnt, and you could DE the blues, with 10 bosses, the enchanting mats would soon stack up.  Even at level 39-40, you could run the deadmines in approx 20-25 mins.  
---
I know, cos this is what I DID back in vanilla.
---
This is exactly what I'm getting at, all I want is blizz to just come out and say thats why they invited all of them instead they told us "invites and based on sub length." Which is true except for streamers. Why is that? Advertising obviously, like I said I PERSONALLY just 99% of streamers, theres just this thing about them I absolutely cant stand. I guess that makes some people on here angry at me, but oh well.
---
Id like to take a moment to appreciate ruffneckflex3 and hollysheeto who have taken their precious time to comment on 90% of posts here, even if just to say ignore something and move on or the monumental contribution of u mad. Can we get a round of applause for the irony?
---
Been playing since WOTLK. I really want to be a high DPS role.  Will be mostly playing PVE and levelling with a prot warrior.  Is there a class that you accel at this? Obvious options would be:
---
Mage
---
Warlock
---
Rogue
---
?
---
I am leaning towards mage due to portals and conjure food, but no completely convinced. with the class, if you could suggest some professions that would be awesome.
---
Its all up how many ppl can be in 1 phase zone
---
&gt; Didn't they add that chaining feature during late vanilla?
---
The chaining feature was re-worked after vanilla. The first iteration took you to the flightpoint and just skipped the unmount/mount portion. Cancelling however was always possible, but first only by logging out in the leg before your desired destination.
---
This should be your deciding factor. Classic is about the immersion.
---
And the complete opposite for me
---
If we were ever stuck trolling for one more it was a tank 9/10
---
No no Im a serious. Its not like Im logging in to my funny trolling account or anything.
---
It was the first one that was stable and truly Blizzlike. Most servers before it had a bunch of bugs and issues, especially with how mobs acted and were scripted.
---
Not that Nost wasn't bugfree, but it was just better than everyone else.
---
I thought beta would bring clarity to what class i wanted to main... It did not.
---
18 seconds.  Mages would have to ice block cold snap ice block to block the full damage.  But even still that puts the hunter at the advantage because now they are at full range and can kite the mage who has to save his blink for stuns.  It will be interesting to see.
---
The only viable PvE spec Shaman have is resto. Elemental goes oom too fast. It's probably the worst off meta spec next to Boomkin.
---
If you play Shaman and you want to raid, you are going to be a healer.
---
If you just want to dungeon or PvP, it doesnt matter what class or spec you want to play. In PvP the meta is Elemental/resto. Either 31/20 or 30/21 depending on preference.
---
Haha! This is exactly what I was thinking.
---
We looked into it in the original post, the flight path animations disappeared in 5.1, while the cancel button appeared in 6.1 according to a vid from Heelsvsbabyface where he talks about this addition
---
Have you ever been on youtube ever? Its full of guides and answers.  
---
Go engineer for pvp/pve if ”serious”
---
Human is if you ONLY pve
---
Both are top tier classes in pvp/pve
---
Neither are hard to master in pve
---
The better you are the better your pvp performance is. Its not a 1v1 game its a team game.
---
You need gold to level faster. You won't be able to get a mount at 40 if you ignore making gold. Or you might run in to trouble with upgrading skills. Unless you play a druid or shaman, I would suggest picking up two gathering profession to get to 60 fastest. You can always level up another profession later.
---
Calm down buddy, it's just a dumb meme.
---
gone since 5.1, never returned to retail...
---
I was leatherworker / Skinner on my main back in the days then switched to Engineering at 60 for PVP. 
---
I am still on the fence of doing that, I really enjoyed skinning stuff and leatherworking. It felt like what's a rogue would do... But I also remember that switching from LW to Engineering was a pain because I had to rely on auction house, alt and friends.
---
Considering that none of my friends will play Classic, and I don't know if I will have a guild that will help me it's a taught choice.
---
I fear if I get my fiancee into WoW Classic, I'll never see her again lol.
---
Paladin for sure
---
I took just a week off thank goodness Labor Day is at the end of my week I get 7 full days.
---
You can hold your nose and say "duuuude, seriously?".
---
Pretty much but I swap remorseless attacks for ruthlessness in bgs
---
Consider disc for PVE+PVP or a raid-friendly [tri-spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGsobZbxuzZVMgz0t) that dominates in group PVP.
---
my favorite from vanilla that always made me laugh. &lt;nagas stole my bike&gt;
---
The guild was awesome. Felicia Day was my celebrity crush back then.
---
Depends on how you look at it. For some people, having an hour queue would destroy classic. So in my opinion, yes I’d rather have sharding in this case. If the server isn’t full then it’s simple, there won’t be any secondary shards.
---
That was Wrath so we will have that debate in 3 years after they launch the newly updated TBC content.
---
That sounds daunting but it's not quite as bad as it seems. They're trash mobs, and for every 100 you kill that's 2%, about the chance of getting an Ironfoe. Also classicDB lists geomancers as having a 3x drop rate chance, but who knows how accurate any of this is.
---
On private servers, Pendulum wasn't too expensive.
---
I did this with my son during vanilla, he was around 5 or 6 and would always ask to play so I taught him how to fish. He leveled fishing on 2 of my alts and found atleast 3 rares during the fishing tournament!
---
Of course it is but this is almost all this sub has become...
---
Would you even want to give a 90y old an orgasm?
---
So much info depends on gear that won't be out at launch.  Renataki's trinket from ZG is the pvp trinket to have.  Weapon speed if I understand correctly is not like in 1.0.  So the 2.0 speed Barman Shanker is not better than the 1.8 speed gutgore ripper mainhand.
---
Fast OH also good in PVP as PVE.
---
Any update?
---
I've reported about 10 bugs but since then nothing has messed up for me. I still have around 40 hours logged just nothing for a week :)
---
Venruki is one of the few streamers I can tolerate (and he is actually good at the game), but this clip-and-snip garbage doesn't belong here - get some original content, OP.
---
Again this is low level content.  Healing is super easy early game unless you overpull.
---
I mean what point are you trying to make ?  That level 30 content is easy for people whose job it is to play WoW 8 hours a day?
---
Shadow Priest is the absolute easiest class to do more than decent in PvP. Someone who has never played wow before could hop on a shadow priest and destroy mediocre players that play their class at a decent level.  
---
Paladins are great healers, but meh in actually killing anyone. Same with druid, you can outlive your opponents while tickling and boring them to death. Mage is a great class but it also takes some effort and knowledge to kill people.
---
Rolling on hopefully an RP PVP server. We are all in our mid to late 30s. The two names we have are The Expendables and The Old Guard.
---
they look awful in retail, you'll see the difference, in retail it's sad af
---
Wow was always cartoonish.......
---
Sounds fun to me! I’ve actually seen some people planning to do group “Amish” runs, where the guild levels only using equipment crafted within the group, no non-crafted weapons allowed after level 15!
---
I can understand that sentiment, not wanting to burned multiple times. Have some faith! They have done a phenomenal job up to this point. I think everyone is just getting anxious waiting for classic.
---
You're currently having a 9 year old? That pushing stage of labor is gonna HURT.
---
I never actually played Vanilla and I have never actually watched a stream so I actually dont know actually.
---
&gt; the classic community is incredibly split on what "they" want.
---
For sure. Some members of classic legitimately think classic is a solid foundation to build patch-style content upon - it isn't. It was what it was and it was a strong first attempt, but it was only a stepping stone to the much richer and more compelling experience known as Burning Crusade.
---
exactly. what people remember is doing dungeons with what odd people you could find, under leveled and with no coordination. Classic WILL be hard under those circumstances. 
---
Just like I remember. Any run can range from easy to omfg the tank is using battle stance as full arms with all white gear not taunting.
---
The thing people forget is the true diversity of the playerbase. ANYTHING can be hard or easy depending on how you approach it.
---
Its not as easy as "everything is faceroll because the synergy, items and specs were always perfect"
---
even though that WILL happen. For some the game will be a faceroll, for others it will be OP WTF as gaming tends to be. 
---
(played from classic to retail, started when dire maul was released, most playing hours in classic, tbc, and wotlk)
---
I got my kids to bring me beer. Seems like a learned a new thing here.
---
I am testing things out in private server so i am talking about end game rogue 
---
Also i just realised how superior hemo is to other specs so i will continue to play as hemo swords
---
Paladin.
---
Too bad BRD is 42+, that would be some great content.
---
Its 3-4 usually.
---
&gt; You've backpeddled into the troll excuse. You have no point. You have no meaning. You have no significance. 
---
Agree!
---
&gt; You will be forgotten
---
Perhaps. But right now Im on your mind and there is nothing you can do about it!
---
I win!
---
Once you get past anyone using 2h fury, no one needs big 2hs for raiding (except hunters that need something with some AP).   There should be plenty to go around for both the rets and warriors as time goes on.
---
I have no idea how they would handle it for the exact reasons you brought up.  This is exactly why we need a response from Blizzard about this issue because I think it has the potential to have a large effect on classic and not any simple solutions.
---
And 20 years of time gated content
---
You would probably try silverpine.  For the simple fact that the Tauren, Orc's and Troll's all head to the Barrens for those levels, provided they don't go explore.  Just more congestion i would think with 3 races as opposed to 1.
---
Torn between shammy and paladin, I enjoy pvp mostly.
---
But from what i heard shammies melt quite easly because of no escapes.
---
And paladins have no offensive abilities making solo content near impossible.
---
Ideas?
---
You have a girlish handwriting.
---
Points if it's a metal Scooby-Doo lunch box with a game and a spinner on it
---
well I would say this takes 10-15 hours depending how good you know the classic quests etc
---
They sell for 5s. So you're telling me you were able to get 8 *stacks* of iron bars, and 40 *stacks* of silk cloth ***PER HOUR***? At level 40???
---
Yeah I'm calling massive bullshit, your numbers are ridiculously off.
---
It depends on what kind of guild Im going to find. Pvp will be such a grind that you really need a premade to make it to top ranks. Most likely Im going to be more pve oriented.
---
Watch this.
---
https://youtu.be/QUZlI6r4T4c
---
Some small tibits:
---
* Both of us were a bit higher than 40.
---
*I had full blue gear from chain instances (like they will have).
---
* I have mortal strike and he has soul Link.
---
* Because it's TBC, sweeping strikes and death wish are switched. Me having death wish gives me a much higher chance to win. In vanilla that's not the case.
---
* This warlock was not good. He spans fear on me even though I'm fear immune for 30s. Imagine if all of those wasted casts were immolate, shadow bolt, etc.
---
* The warlock has death coil, but it's use in this duel was inconsequential so it can be ignored.
---
Okay given all that. Notice something? Id say I played it pretty well, but even still, the warlock only BARELY lost and oar tof that was due to a lucky string of crits at the beginning. I don't even think this guy fel dommed and had two shields. The core issue is wattiors don't gain rage while the shield is up. The ONLY way I see it doable is if the warrior uses stuff like sapper charge the moment the warlock sacs his pet.
---
Install an addon?
---
Got cockblocked. Now my entire client is gone.
---
3 per account, not per server
---
More stupid memes, yay!!!
---
Darn lol
---
I'm really torn, on what class to play.
---
Part of a 3 person team. One is  doing Frost mage, other is doing BM hunter.  after 60, will probably spend more time with hunter as a duo than with mage (different schedules)
---
End game, I intend to split my time between Battle grounds, (I want to win them not farm them), Farming gold,  Raiding for gear, trying to win the Fishing tournament, every week,
---
Here are the ones I'm considering in no particular order.
---
**Priest**,  (Holy / disc, would  help us form dungeon runs fast, and make us more appealing to guilds, and raids) , Battle grounds, I can dispel, heal, shield but I'm stuck in the back field, with the main pack.  Levitate lets me walk on water for fishing but doesn't let me mount) Potential to AE farm lashers with Holy nova, but money mostly comes from grinding dungeons.
---
**Pally**, @60 I'd be a healing buff bot, in BG's I'd be working the blessing of freedom, cleanse, heals, and attempting to peel with engineering. (faster mount speed for traveling fishing nodes), money farming, is basically healing 5 dungeon runs. or paying to swap specs.
---
**Druid.**@60,  I raid heal, innovate, remove curse, abolish poison.,   Run the Flag in WSG, and defend the nodes in AB,  Heal in AV, when things get bad I run away. Potential to join Rogues in stealth dungeon runs.  And cheetah lets me run between nodes faster than other characters can mount up.  could do stealh runs in dungeons for money.
---
**Warlock.** @60, I dot, nuke, fear with the main pack in the BG's,   In raids, I provide Summons, Cookies, Soul stones, the desired debuff, Occasionally some CC, and basically just spam nukes because Dots won't be wanted usually.  No particular help with Fishing tournament. Can solo grind with the best of them for money,
---
I guess that's the issue
---
it's a sincere advice, if you want to do it go ahead, don't cry when you are not finding groups. That is how the game works, deal with it.
---
Are people really subbing for a shot at beta? Hasn't it been well established for a long time that you'll get an email regardless if they want you, that most of the invites have gone out, and that the people that have gotten in are mostly 2004 accounts?
---
Well you're level 12 and have 40 hours logged I mean it's fine. getting to level 10 should take a few hours at most. So if someone is like level 9 and 3 hours gameplay I don't think it's worth keeping him on the beta program.
---
This is how it was with me.  I planned out the leveling path I would take, and was so burned out by doing it the second time so close together that I started boting for PvP.
---
I think that's going to depend on where you are in the pack.  If you feel you're ahead I would go barrens.  If not, go silverpine.
---
Awesome share, thx :)
---
If you want additional deciding info: Druids lack an out-of-combat rez, which often makes them less desired healers in 5mans. Shaman lack the sheer diversity of priests when it comes to *pure* healing, but they have one over on them when it comes to utility via totems.
---
Also, if you go priest, you can go and get Benediction/Anathema. If you go Shaman, you get mail armor and shields as well as a built-in passive "wipe protection" in the form of reincarnation, if you go durid, you is for fite. Erm, I mean, you get cat form with prowl, which is pretty nifty for avoiding mobs.
---
So, dunno myself, and I'm struggling with this question as well. Originally, I was set on playing a rogue/Priest combo on Alliance, just as I had been doing in Vanilla. But as time goes on, I find myself drawn more towards the Horde. I *think* I may go Shaman as my healer for the reason that I really am not comfortable without a standard rezz, and that I can bring utility to the group with my totems. I think "totems" may in fact be the deciding factor over priests. Which, knowing myself, I'll sooner or later roll one as alt anyhow simply because I don't feel at home on a server unless i have a priest on it.
---
&lt;And Two Stealthed Rogues&gt;
---
You should re read what I said, I don't care about not getting beta, I dont care about streamers getting beta, in fact I understand it, however I still think blizzard should just say "hey streamers are invited for advertising/publicity." Because if you go to the forums theres so many angry and mad customers there, I'm not one of them, thats just dumb, it looks like people just skimmed what I wrote and saw that I dont like streamers and thats it.
---
Hi, /u/StrikingVariation
---
Bro ... I am not a native english speaker myself.
---
And bro ... why on earth are you taking me serious?
---
Bro ... Im an not "triggered"
---
Bro ... you are
---
Bro ... I win
---
All of those are top tier dps. So you're safe regardless of what you pick.  
---
If it's easy for you decide based on:  
---
Mage: QoL (teleports/portals/food) and best cc and farming  
---
Warlock: Pocket tank can help so the warrior doesn't have any downtime while leveling, summons, healthstone and you can ressurect yourself/your friend  
---
Rogue: It's difficult to level solo, and so is warrior, but together they can level up pretty fast, the warrior tanks and you backstab, shredding through mobs. No other bonus.
---
Thank you. I really want to play druid because its my OG class..but sadly enough..their armor is pretty ugly in classic. I really want my toon to look awesome. Do you or anyone else agree that druid gear is ugly in classic? At least up until tier 3
---
I am an equal opportunity orgasmer.
---
If thats what you want to do! Ill be doing that on alts. For the first character I will already be fighting for quest objectives and dont want to fight for gathering nodes
---
anything can be your job if you believe hard enough.
---
Yup, I always lied about having those addons but never used them lol
---
What about the other 68 minutes?
---
&gt; Is rogue fine in raids similar to frost mage?
---
Frost Mages essentially spam one spell the entire raid, so not really. Then again, Vanilla raiding is less about personal mechanical complexity and playstyle and more about the collective performance and pre-raid preparation out in the world.
---
I knew of three thunderfuries on my vanilla server, 2 alliance and 1 horde. Two of the three were warriors. The other was an alliance rogue. He got it because he was an insane PVPer and PVEer. He ended up getting Grand Marshal.
---
Yeah, people in this thread are just pulling numbers out of their ass, or talking about TBC/wrath prices or something. G/hr is *waaaay* off on a lot of these... You get 40g/hr farming mara at 60, there's no way you're going to make that pulling pack by pack in VC at 40.
---
Why do you think mages will be over represented?
---
Realistically, how often would a pure DPS class need to respec compared to a hybrid?
---
I've been dead set on Shaman for a while now, but the idea that I'll be spending *so* much gold to respec before/after raids every week (deep resto for progression, ele/enh for PvP or just doing things out in the world) is a pretty big concern for me.
---
I'm very much ok with raiding as resto, but I have a feeling I'll end up switching to rogue eventually.  Always loved the class but haven't raided with it since Vanilla due to quitting and filling the guild's need.
---
Wow you actually bothered to make a retort beyond "Your stupid" or "Your wrong" and actually made several good points.
---
/Clap
---
Clearly I'm inferior to your extensive knowledge of Reddit and World of Warcraft. 
---
Actions such as muting and moving players have been happening since Vanilla for cases that annoy players and lead up to enough reports from said players (there's even a clause for this in the ToS if you'd read it).
---
That isn't the same thing as griefing or a violation of the ToS. If I start using racial slurs or exploiting some in game mechanics to block someone from entering a building or completing a questline, that's griefing and that results in a ban, not a mute, not a relocation. A ban, because the ToS was violated.
---
What he did is akin to free speech in a sense, it's like arguing that just because you hear someone say something you didn't like that they should be arrested. That's not how laws work. This is a classic case of your feelings vs law.
---
Just like how in the example above, a police officer wouldn't arrest a person, maybe they'd caution them and ask them to relocate to a different area away from the complainant but they wouldn't be arrested.
---
This is the EXACT same situation.
---
I concede, action was taken against him (since you're so latched onto that position).
---
However, he did NOT violate the ToS. Nothing he did was griefing and as I said, there's 15 years of examples in the past that back that position up.
---
Again, your feelings vs the law. It is pretty clear that your instability, confrontational attitude and bias all factor into your position on this. You're an angry little man that doesn't like when he doesn't get his way and would rather resort to Ad Hominem, mob mentality and just saying "Your wrong" for several comments before actually bothering to make a rational point and have a discussion.
---
I may be bad arguing with Reddit and WoW veterans but that doesn't pay the mortgage on my house, since I'm not homeless and enjoy the luxury of a home with waterfront I think I'm doing pretty damn good at my job when not having to get in a pissing match with an uneducated internet dweller.
---
You know what they say, "arguing with people on the internet is like playing chess with a pigion, even if you win they're going to strut around and shit all over the board anyways"
---
You're the pigion.
---
Easily the wokest thing ever typed on this sub.
---
Classic videos should be to the tune of downing pool - let the bodies hit the floor as a age appropriate soundtrack.
---
And privates as well
---
Uhm, i just seen I got a fucking platinum award for this. Who’s the kind sir who made that possible I’d like to talk to you.
---
How awkward for you. Confusing depression with autism like that.
---
What do they tech kids in school these days?
---
a stack sells for 20,bro. In the craft, you can craft 2 to 4. Each unit sells for 5s.
---
" Everyone says to play what I like "
---
proceeds to ask what he should play...
---
Shamans have ghost wolf and earthbind totem, which is better than what paladins have for mobility/escape which is bubble hearth.  
---
If you go shaman, eleresto is great because not only can you heal, but also melt people with chain lightning crits.  
---
If you go paladin, everyone will love you, but you are pretty much helpless. It's not impossible to do solo content, it will just take a lot of time, even if you have a ret set in your bags.
---
Niece
---
Beta is not early access. Beta is not early access. Beta is not early access.
---
I watched the shit out of it when the epsiodes released.
---
Ive seen that name before, funny name.
---
"LFM Strat Living side - Orb and Flask reserved"
---
Thats how.
---
I don't think that wanting to have a discussion should ever be "reportable", even if it's about a subject you disagree with.  
---
I agree that the gold they get may not have much of an effect on the economy, however, it will affect the competitiveness of the streamer and their guild's progression in the raid scene.  
---
If we have two guilds, one being the streamer's and one being a normal organized guild, the guild with the streamer will have the edge due to "gifts" they get from their audience. You could argue that a non-streamer guild can still have people funnel all of their resources into the guild to help with progression, but the reality is that both guilds in this scenario will do this anyway. The streamer's guild will funnel their resources as well as be the benefactor of "gifts" the streamer receives from their audience, something the other guild will not get.
---
Not trying to be too big of a dick here but come on man, if you're going to opt in to something blizzard is counting on you actually playing and hopefully doing some bug testing. lol
---
Yeah I'd caution against Shadow priest if you want to raid, there might be a spot for only one of those in a 40man raid. Mage/hunter/warlock are great
---
Nice tissue box...lmao
---
it one more time motherfucker, I dare you, I double dare you.
---
They just started sending waves again.
---
E-mails generally lag behind the beta popping up in launcher.
---
People from 2004 have gotten in but so have people from later.
---
WHO was a better game. But Mythic shot themselves in the foot.
---
It's such a tragedy that the game never found its place and gained the leverage needed to improve.
---
This looks very low effort to me. It's mostly just an import of old art assets into a modern game engine, and using that engine's water and lighting. E.g. it would've taken minutes to put 3d roof tiles on the roofs and made a huge difference.
---
No one is saying you won't deal any damage if you mix it up.
---
Yeah think a good idea with a rogue alt for wpvp messing around.  
---
Tauren Shaman it is windfuy leveling!!!! may loose 80% of battles while leveling but its worth it for that 20% destructions!
---
*surprised Pikachu*
---
Honestly, it really depends on how hardcore you want to get.
---
Progression until end of AQ 40 will be very easy. DPS will almost assuredly never be an issue. If you're a more casual-semi hardcore or already have a set group you can basically just live as a hybrid spec permanently. It's all on how serious you want to get in whatever you're doing.
---
I feel this to my soul, I say I will no life like I did other expansions but probably wont make it to 2am lmfao.
---
You can look at your twitch logs and check the last thing you said in his channel.
---
So ive heard. since totems are group wide there is always room for another Shammy
---
10 - 15 Hours as 5 on an empty server
---
or
---
10 - 15 Hours in maybe launch scenario?
---
Grab your pitchforks boys!
---
Wuld you also rather have LFR than not being able to raid? I have an awesome game to suggest to you
---
But that's the thing of it! They're not acting like NONplayable characters. They're *their* playable characters - bringing the world to life.
---
People underestimate how much subsequent expansions damaged roleplaying in WoW. With the ever-increasing slot machine convenience and quickening pace, the world got bigger and the distance between places *and* the distances between players grew. Plus the lore got fucky.
---
Vanilla was the best time for roleplaying in Warcraft.
---
I've got the same problem, seriously considering just rolling 2 shaman to avoid the money hole lol, Tauren for resto raiding, orc for enhancement pvp
---
There are plenty of companies out there doing novel ideas .... They just dont happen to be named Blizzard.  Quite a few have small budgets and others actually have decent sized budgets often from kick starters.  Quite a few turds for every gold nugget though ...
---
Mages are always great, through all of classic. Frost through MC/BWL, then fire and ignites for AQ40/Naxx. Pairs well wtih tailoring early for Bloodvine set (once ZG is released), but becomes useless by late AQ40 and Naxx bis pieces.
---
DPS warriors are really strong as well. Generally top DPS (unless you get that sweet rolling ignite going as a fire mage)
---
&gt;  But every time it's suggested people go "I BET YOU WANT TO ADD LFR/LFG/DEATH KNIGHTS TOO" or something along those lines. Yes because wanting my tauren to not have Muppet mouth and shovel hands means I want gameplay changes
---
Yeah I can't stand that.
---
Like, would it hurt if we had more hairstyles??
---
Damn I could not find it. HERE IT COMES!
---
You could probably get better gear in the same time by running some dungeons, but I really like being able to craft some gear upgrades.
---
You really have to focus on levelling your profession for that to work, though. It's really easy to get stuck in a place where you can always craft gear that would have been good for you 10-15 levels ago.
---
So incredibly worth it. The dopamine from your wind fury crits will keep you going til your next batch. Get that corpsemaker and go make the grass grow
---
How does this system works really? You see a comment you dont agree with and then pick an mental illness and post that and that makes you like feel good or something?
---
I win.
---
Its true though.  Horde warriors go 2h because of windfury.
---
On the alliance the warriors and rogues are always fighting over the good swords
---
To top it off you only have a one 1h without offhand and getting a 2g requires lvl 10 walking to a city. But atleast you are the king of lvling post 10/20
---
And a guild “Naga Stole My Bike”.
---
I can't decideeeeeeee
---
My first ever 60 was a Rogue. Played the crap out of him especially when they released the battle ground rewards.
---
But I also am thinking about Mage, Warlock, or Warrior or Druid.
---
I hated getting blown up by a trinket mage back in the day... so it would be fun to try it out now :D
---
Warlocks were fun and interesting and as a kid I never fully understood their potential.
---
The legendary High Warlord Warrior Pat is my inspiration for being a Warrior. Super fun to see huge numbers in PvP
---
And a druid because of Gold Farming, tri-spec, and great flag runner haha
---
I dunno, I'll probably spin the wheel for it.
---
having an additional resurrection or emergency offheal/bubble and acceptable dps for 5-mans is a great bonus, and that's even before buffs. Spriests/enh-ele shaman/ret paladins are awesome in 5-mans, especially if the healer is a druid for instance.
---
I'd recommend ele/resto (30/21) for pvp, you should also be able to heal in most guilds that aren't trying to be hardcore with this build.
---
Is that like good mad or mad mad or bad mad?
---
I like good memes and this is one. old school runescape subreddit is 90% memes and that subreddit is fucking hilarious
---
I think it's important for OP to listen to this. I don't like mage personally, it's pretty limited at the first raid tier, but it's very good for pve and pvp.
---
&lt;Loch Modan Gun Club&gt;
---
Honestly if you like druid then you should consider it. You'll be able to tank dungeons as much as you want no problem and off-tank in raids if your not looking for a top 5% progression guild. You might even end up liking healing in raids. 
---
I regret picking a rogue in vanilla (despite playing when they were OP) because it pigeonholes you to one playstyle. 
---
You'll also fit into your group better, since you guys won't have to wait forever to grab a tank.
---
Exactly this...
---
Are you? Was a honest question.
---
Either way you could have made more selling the iron and silk alone
---
Am I the only one who isnt a fan of the changes to heroes and leveling up like that?  Really didn't like the introduction of "hero" units to strategy games.
---
I want RP-PvP too. I hope we will get one from the start. It would be not cool from Blizzard not to have one in MMORPG game
---
I remember house/pet sitting for my then girlfriend (now wife) while she was on vacation with her family. I did have a job but when I wasn’t working, I was playing WoW on my shitty laptop and watching The Office. I think this was in 2007. Just me, two dogs, and a cat kickin’ it playing some WoW.
---
You are the real MVP thank you so much for this!!!
---
What just happened?
---
just get a clock addon
---
The leveling experience was amazing, but the end game content was about as grindy as BFA with no real goal to strive for..
---
If PvP is your goal, I'd say paladin. Easy raid invite for gear and they are so Incredibly amazing in PvP with all the utility and healing they can put out.
---
Solo content will be difficult, but it won't be significantly worse than a shaman, depending on spec. You could also dabble with some builds. I've see some reckoning/holy builds that have worked well.
---
Should I let the 5% intellect bonus for gnomes influence my choice of playing mage?  As far as I know, intellect in classic gives a small amount of maximum mana and crit rate.  Is that correct?  Assuming equal gear and play, how much more damage will a gnome do than a human?  Does the increased maximum mana help you from going out of mana?  Basically, how big of a boon is it for mages?
---
Do you honestly believe that the streamers will stop receiving gifts upon release?
---
You clearly missed my point of today gaming industry.
---
But who cares? Stop beeing salty about streamers, dont watch them if you dont like the content and enjoy your classic experiance on the 27th august.
---
Wasn't there an option to show old character models in the menu?
---
They should give some basic rules, all the things I have tried don't work.
---
I don't differentiate at all between good and bad memes, if a sub gets to a point where 80%+ of the content is silly memes the overall quality suffers immensly.
---
Very true. Grouped up with a couple of ppl in one of the stress tests for the wendigo hide q in Dun Morogh. We startes out at the same time and one dude in the grp got all 8 while I only had 1. He just said «thx» and straight up left without helping, that asshole
---
Having to, are strong words.
---
it's pretty noticeable imo.
---
hard to tell, if you are lucky and you all get into the game verry quick then you can get ahead and 15 hours should be doable. If you get unlucky and have to waite for friends to connect etc then you probably won't all make it before sleeping.
---
Serisouly I don't think DM will be possible in 1 night
---
Ledge!
---
I mean it's a meme. Not a good meme, but still a meme. Not that it matters but I have a lvl 20, 16, 15 and a bunch of other low level stuff. Trying to figure out what I want to play on launch. I'm also stopping and enjoying stuff and trying to find bugs. Although I've had a very smooth experience so far so not many bugs.
---
Spirit&gt; int when lvling tho
---
Alright people, let’s do this one last time.
---
Seeing a lot of comments where people want to play mage.  Also, in polls they're a popular choice.
---
I agree, i'm a melee player but mage in vanilla can do just about anything. 
---
If you hate melee classes then you will love mage because that is our weakness in PvP.
---
Freeze,blink, frostbolt gg
---
Many of the things in the middle of their screen are TMW or WA popups though and are only on screen when they're actually relevant.
---
For sure, I forgot to include that in my post!
---
I am going to come back and level Mining and Blacksmith after I hit 60. 
---
Going to do a lot of dungeons as I level as I am going to hybrid Prot build to level my warrior. No it will not be as fast. But I want to do as many dungeons as I can as I level. Keep me in gear as I go and will be more fun I think. Live in SM in my 30s heh. 
---
I have opening week off. Hope to find a healer buddy willing to no life to 60 in those 7 days.
---
I currently have 3 character types I want to play in Classic most of all now; A Feral DPS/Tank tauren druid (possibly my main), an orc Resto sham, and a human Spelladin.  My only question is what professions, both for leveling and endgame, are best for each class/spec?  The shaman might delve into PvP so that ones grabbing Engineering at some point
---
Whenever I see pictures of this statue I always remember that TBC quest in WPL where this Blood Knight, who holds a really bad grudge against Uther for the fall of Arthas and the invasion of Quel'Thalas, sends you to defile (I think) Uther's tomb. Then, when you arrive to the tomb, Uther's ghost shows up and tells you he forgives that one Blood Knight. The quest kinda makes you feel like a huge dick for what you were going to do, and respect Uther a bit more.
---
For the time this was absolutely the most effective means of fighting an equally strong opponent.
---
Ah by bad, I forgot it's 2 grenades per piece of cloth/bar. So it's going to be 20 stacks of bars and 20 stacks of cloth per hour. Pretty sure that's even more unbelievable...
---
I've leveled 4 warriors to 60 and raided on private servers. However with classic coming I'm going to be going on this adventure by myself because I played primarily with west coast or EU players and now with classic I'll be able to play on a server with 0 ping I've been debating trying something new like a lock or mage just for ease of solo play and gold farming what's everyone's thoughts on these two classes? I also highly value numbers on the damage charts to fuel my ego
---
Thought you still needed fadeleaf for blinding powder. Either way if you pickpocket stuff you should be fine on rogue mats.
---
I don't think they started sending waves again?  I can't see anywhere on this reddit nor the forums where anyone says they got invited.
---
Yeah could be an option, I feel like if someone logged in day 1 for a few hours and is no show since then should be revoked access.
---
There is a lot of people out there who played WoW for years and could be good assets to report bugs and test out stuff. 
---
I was lucky enough to be in the stress-test and spam the login servers, test the sharding system etc. I really do enjoy finding bugs and other stuff, I remember back in Vanilla I was always climbing and trying to find map model bugs.

Dont feel bad, there wont be any wife aggro for you!
---
I'll make it clear for you since you seem to be fresh out of highschool and lacking the ability to properly differentiate.
---
Standing on Totems, while annoying isn't the same as blocking an entrance to a building or blocking a quest NPC.
---
It doesn't fall under the definition of griefing. It is annoying yes, but is in no way griefing. You can still click the totem (be it obviously difficult but still possible).
---
The action taken was for the players who spent time and effort creating this event and made enough reports complaining about the player. It wasn't due to a ToS violation.
---
You are clearly ignoring the big picture of the argument here. The intent. The player was intending on being annoying and being a troll. He wasn't impeeding player progression or directly obstructing a critical part of the game to a point that it was 100% inaccessible.
---
Do you know how many Taruens would stack potions and sit on Mailboxes for hours without bans? They would be moved to a random zone by a GM if enough reports came through yes, but even in repeat offenses there was never a ban because that isn't a violation of the ToS because no matter how big a Tauren gets you can't 100% obstruct the mailbox.
---
That's the difference between actually blocking an intended in game device vs just being a troll.
---
Being a troll isn't a violation.
---
Now get off the internet and go do something with your life.
---
Have you played classic? 
---
The old water effects was the scrambled porn water. 
---
They UPDATED IT to a smoother effect that you can toggle if you want lol.
---
Actually thats a bit more difficult, because the younger generation is more splitted. Yes, there are many who speak english very well, but I also know people who dont use or extend what they learned in school. I think especially in Berlin there is a clash of both camps, because it is the main hub for young, modern startups.
---
I think the biggest factor for learning english is the job (e.g. what would a developer do without stackoverflow?\^\^) .
---
And the biggest factor for NOT learning it, is in my opinion multimedia.
---
In germany we have many actors who specialize in voice acting, because every movie, series and nearly every video game is translated with high effort.
---
We even have specific voice actors for Bruce Willis, Tom Hanks etc.
---
I really appreciate the effort, but if I have to compare myself with our dutch neigbours, where most of the stuff is just shown in english, you understand why the average dutch speaks way better english, than the average german. Because it helps you so much, if you are confronted with that from a very young age.  
---
Personal anecdote from me: last week I was in prague with my girlfriend and we actually had exact the same you encountered in Berlin. So I think the situation in germany is the same.
---
rrrreeeeeeeEEEEEEE**EEEEEEEEE*****EEEEEEEEEE***
---
If you're not in a guild pushing world first or top 5%, racials don't matter. The fact that you have to ask that is enough to decide that it's not the case. Go with what looks best to you.
---
Absolutely, if you're willing to work to better yourself as a player then you will fit in within the guild.  We don't plan on being an elite guild and force everyone to no life it, but rather ask that you're willing to take constructive criticism to improve.
---
Here is my question to you. Why do you even care that I care?
---
And to answer your question. I don't actually. Weird huh?
---
You Joking right ?
---
Charging rent in the form of wow gold, brilliant!

They didn't lie. There are sa *shitload* of non-streamers in the beta who have been subbed since 2004.

Some guilds will carry a shadow priest in raids, while some will have a holy priest spec 0/30/21 and keep up shadow weaving with rank 1 mind flay, and heal otherwise.
---
Don't write an essay mate :p Keep it simple.
---
Horde Dualwield in equal gear will still deal more damage than horde 2h even when fishing for wf procs 
---
Now I will concede that earlier on with less access to +hit and perhaps an easier time getting a good two handed early on in raiding that it may be the more viable choice - but acting like it’s strictly better is wrong.
---
Nice!!!
---
Why would I want to pay blizzard to playtest their beta?
---
I'm torn between Rogue and Hunter. I've played a few hunters to ~50 on PServers and it was some of the most fun I've had in WoW. I'm considering Rogue because I'm drawn towards stealth classes in most games I play. I do think I'll struggle with Rogue gameplay initially but progressively getting better at it would be rewarding. Rogues and Hunters out there sell me on your class!
---
&gt;Keep in mind your guild of course, but if they don't mind, you can pug onyxia with some reserves, maybe do a little gold bid on the head of onyxia and bag, ez money,
---
You might even be able to offer this service as a guild.  Get a bunch of you together (say 10 for the sake of argument) and just charge to run pugs through the raid.  It could be a smoother run if that many of you are experienced with the encounter and each others' role in it.
---
It's arguably faster than swords against targets 2-3 levels lower than you. Once you are in your 30's at least. Against same and higher level targets its considerably worse.
---
If you're going to be part of the rush and don't want to spend hours in the starting zone trying to complete quests, try this:
---
1-2: group up and do the kill quests
---
3-5: get out of the starting area, and go start grinding the mobs you can kill in the next area. Do quests if you can.
---
If you can get out ahead of the pack, you'll have a much better time.
---
The guys at the locomotive shop all rolled there eyes when I told them in taking all the rest of my vacation to play video games.  :)
---
This is 48 seconds of my life that are gone forever.
---
What good would revoking access do though?  Besides, maybe the player is busy right now, but has tons of time to test in the coming months.
---
Eh, a lot of people just ticked the box without giving it much thought. Blizzard are a big enough company to expect a certain percentage of the people they send an invite out to will not use it and send out extra invites to compensate honestly.
---
You don’t have to explain yourself to salt bois on the internet
---
I dont have any numbers to back it up but 5% increased intellect for a class that is very mana dependent seems totally worth it if you're the min/max type
---
Ten is a bit much, but yes adding a couple of your guilds healers helps a ton.
---
It is my dream, as a human priest, to walk around with &lt;FUCK FEAR WARD&gt; under my name.
---
Pity that mature language is not allowed in guild titles and I can never realize my dream.
---
Well it‘s part of the gameplay to land an opener, if you are not able to do it well l2p 😅
---
thank you very much!
---
My guild will definitely be going pretty hard. There's a lot of incredibly useful stuff deep in resto so I doubt I'd be comfortable having only 21 points there. At least during progression.
---
Are they not doing any more waves of beta invites? I feel like throughout this whole process I've heard so much misinformation or straight up wrong info.
---
95% of people on private servers use Luna Unit Frames anyway which has the same if not more features than the default blizzard raid UI from the modern version.
---
For the most part every class is good in PvP. In PvE raiding, Druids and Hunters are the least recruited classes, but you still want a couple of them per raid.
---
Just keep in mind that no class has a single spec that's best in both PvE and PvP. So you'll either have to grind gold to afford respecs to be in your optimal spec for both parts of the game, or choose a compromise build. If that's your goal, some classes have better compromise builds, while others really need to be in a specific PvP or PvE build.
---
Priest is a great class, but your role is different in PvE and PvP and if you want to excel at both you'll have to swap specs. This is the case with just about every class in the game.
---
Yeah I am only taking about 8 days.  Was thinking about canceling current scheduled days to add to it.  Dunno how the bosses would feel losing me for 3 weeks straight.
---
It's always the tank or rogue, too. They set the loot to ffa, then grab what they need first then bail on the group.
---
Good guy Blizz doing his job
---
YES, ANOTHER PERSON WITH A BRAIN, *THANK YOU*
---
I think many people, including myself, don’t really see it as hard work that can be wasted, but rather as intrinsically enjoyable.
---
I leveled to 30 but then quit pretty quickly. Now I'm 31 but I kinda lost motvation already because it will be the same at 40. 
---
I feel if I play too much I will be burned out when it finally releases and I have to level AGAIN.
---
Thank you I needed that lmao
---
You are wrong. Sure you will have trouble upgrading spells but a lot of the spells arent useful for leveling and you can and should skip them for the mount. Leveling professions is also slower than leveling your character in the sense of that you are gonna reach zones where you cant pick up nodes/flowers because your skill isnt high enough and then you have to choose if you keep leveling and leave the professions behind or stop leveling to catch up on professions. The only one that works is skinning but its still a waste of time if you wanna level fast. You can easily afford a mount at 40 or close to it if you always choose the most valuable quest rewards and dont buy skills that dont help you leveling at all
---
As long as the orc /dance stays the same, I'm down with that.
---
This is great Man, I hope you find your boyz!
---
This is great looking and kudos to the artists but I really do prefer the old aesthetics and for it to look less 'real' and more stylized. I always liked blizzards approach to stylized graphics
---
I'm hoping that this time around we can actually down the bosses with more ease than the first time round due to how the average player will have much more knowledge and skill than back then, and the UI being less clunky, as well as more useful addons that'll pop up. 
---
Not only that but there'll be no rush since TBC won't be announced while Naxx is out, and it should give us all time to gather enough tanks with the right gear, etc.
---
Oh...
---
For some reason when I saw the topic title I thought this was a "What should I play while waiting for classic" topic
---
they don't stack? well pursuit of justice became useless. I don't think they can keep up with a hunter even with repetence
---
That's pretty hilarious.  That guild won't level too fast compared to the average player, but setup properly they should be rollin in dough and gear by the time they hit 60.
---
I tell everyone not my wife that I'm going "home".
---
All that time I always said the only game that will kill WoW will be WoW.
---
Level 12 on launch day... pepelaugh.
---
I understand you haven't been exposed to Factorio yet. If you're looking for a way to pass the time til classic, give it a look, and if you thought WoW was addictive, have you got a surprise in store for you!
---
&lt;project KODO&gt;
---
Because they're fun and powerful
---
There should be a big asterisk here. They're terrible DPS in AQ and Naxx as they don't scale very well. That being said they will still perform better than all of the suboptimal builds like ret. Additionally unless you're super hardcore there will be easily more than 1 spot available. Most guilds will not have 25 people filled with just rogues mages and warriors.
---
Wolfshead helm is considered BiS for entire game

Check Lauranas list maybe?

---
I mean I do agree with that, but at that point for me personally, I’d rather play something else or work on a project at my house than play the beta to rewind what I did. I had tons of alts in vanilla, so it was fun doing it. But even then they could end up as a twink or something and not just gone.
---
Getting married this year too and wife prolly going to want to pop kids out soon after.
---
Wish I was 15 again.  Then I could buy bitcoin and no-life wow till I die.
---
How did it go?
---
One of the reasons I can’t wait for classic is because of the old night elf models. Females look so much better.
---
Think I’m going to play a rogue, I’m just not sure how I will go for groups at 60. I played a priest and warrior in vanilla so I was always wanted in groups, going to be on the opposite end of the spectrum now. I really enjoy world pvp as well and while rogues are pretty good 1v1 they are certainly limited against great casters like mage. I would play a warlock but my girlfriend is playing a lock. Thoughts appreciated.
---
It’s an old game man, what kind of content are you aching for? Anytime any asks game related questions people just say google it or link one of ten different guides on the topic.
---
Tailoring is competing with First Aid. You defiantly want to level First Aid too.
---
Many people wait with doing the gold spending professions until 60. Meaning they go something like Mining/Skinning while leveling. Then at 60 they replace them with Engineering and, in your case, Tailoring once they feel they are confident in their gold income.
---
I prefer /laugh /spit
---
I watched a streamer on YT talk about healing as a shaman in the beta. He said that he had never needed to drink for mana in dungeons. Let that sink in for a moment.
---
No, you misunderstand, you can play it just as you like, but harrassment should be punished nevertheless. Actively going out of your way to prevent someone else from playing the game for extended periods of time is basically DoSing.
---
Thanks for your work, you're amazing!
---
Aren't flight paths for bathroom breaks and catching up on some reading?
---
I too, am planning a LAN party, but we are waiting till the friday after launch because 1. it will be a friday and 2. launch day craziness makes for a kinda lame party. It would suck to get a bunch of people over and just all be stuck in a queue.

Countdown To Classic has a bit of everything for you today as we touch on beta news and talking points as well as a couple of class conversations.
---
Listeners call in on whether or not Blizzard should invoke the ban hammer for trolling streamed events, and covers off on more beta impressions as we dive deeper into what Classic has to offer.
---
Next, a number of hardcore Warrior theorycrafters call in relation to the latest blue post from Blizzard about hit caps and the solved and unsolved mysteries behind the numbers for melee classes in Classic.
---
Finally, a pair of experienced Priests join the show to convince me that my choice of rolling with the light (or shadow) is the right way to go for my main on release day, as we discuss Priest PvE gameplay at length.

You're telling me that in addition to playing the same game I played years ago, that I'll use the same internet database to look stuff up? That's awesome.

Nope, the Cvar command no longer does anything.

Why is there a fire elemental is Stockades?

I said I liked ranged but don’t know what ranged will do good.”noob post”

They need to bring back the gritty realism of WC3, when their jaws would unhinge and flop all over the screen when they talked.
---
The slippery slope argument for adding an in-game clock is pretty ridiculous. We're not talking about automated dungeon grouping or LFR here, its a damn clock.
---
This decision boils down to which faction you prefer. They're both great classes, but faction choice obviously decides for you.

Great news everyone! Blizzard has made a very positive change! And no, I am not Professor Putricide.

Oh wait what?  Un'Goro is gonna have a flight path now?  Wow...
---
That's kind of a bummer, because that totally changes the context of Un'Goro from what defined it during the vanilla days.  But hey, they gotta choose some point on time to re-create, so be it.  Can't make everyone happy I guess.
---
you're best idea would be to just go watch some vids and maybe even play retail a little to get a feel for a class. 
---
I leveled a shadow priest, and they were fun, but you are very squishy in PVP.  However, played well (not me :D), they are brilliant in PVP.  
---
I loved playing a hunter or shammy in pvp. Hunter was great at ranged...and in vanilla (pre arenas), they were great in PVP cos mostly there are other fights going on in front of you, so you can stay ranged.  I loved resto shammy too as they were tough to kill and great fun just being a pocket healer to a  well geared tank or mage.

Youre right there are, there are a lot of them who werent though who are complaining and pissed off if you look at the forums believing that they didnt get in over a streamer who is relatively new to the game, so I admit lie was a bad word to use I will use uninformed, blizz should inform these people why streamers are getting in because even though I dont like or watch streamers I'm tired of seeing alot of streamer hate on the forums for them getting in the beta.

If they're stupid anime hairstyles, then yes. Yes it would hurt.

but human's sense stealth is also incredibly good.

You should really opt out of the things you’re not interested in beta testing. That is literally what it’s there for and you sound pretty sincere. That, if you’re just trolling. Your points are valid if you aren’t, just don’t take that opportunity from others if you don’t want it.

i'm kinda irritated by people applying for beta with no intention of actually *beta testing*.  the whole point is to fix the game up, not for you to play or not
---
Well that doesn't seem to be the only thing you don't have any idea about.
---
Im leveling tailoring/enchanting even though pretty much everything you read on this sub says not to and that skinning is practically mandatory.  
---
Fuck that.  Im playing to have fun.  I dont give a shit if i have to go grind some mobs for cloth when im a few levels higher than them (and maybe hope for some greens at the same time).  
---
Yes, its going to take me longer to get to 60.  i dont give a shit as long as im having fun...and working towards/accomplishing goals is part of that fun.
---
BFA killed itself, at this point it's more seeing if Classic has the draw to save it.
---
Necessary? So you wouldnt have a good time unless you took a month straight off to play a video game?
---
upvoted just for the funny face
---
Yup, the elemental/summon totems came in TBC, and Hex came in WotLK.
---
You have good support overall but basically zero CC (just frost shock and earthbind totem).
---
Oh, and even if you put points into improved Ghost Wolf, it's still not a instant cast. Shamans in vanilla kinda suck honestly. TBC fixed a lot of things.
---
I think the main issue here is people being very focused on launch and phase 1. So the method you describe will not net you that much money at first, due to everyone spending on mounts/gear/professions. Give it a few months and it becomes more realistic. So as a long term investment, why not.
---
Beyond true.  It's like they know their audience's crippling addiction and how to exploit it.
---
Warlock or Priest (PvE)?
---
I have played a Paladin back in Vanilla and this time around I want to play a class, which is highly sought after at lvl 60. So far I'm thinking about playing either a Holy / Disc Priest (Dwarf) or a Warlock on the Alliance side. As most other, I won't have the time nowadays to instantly level to 60 so it will definitely take me some time.
---
Which class will be more desired by raids, even if not fully pre-Raid BiS, especially taking into account that I won't be raiding super early?
---
We are debating all the time what will be better for us. 2 of us really want to experience the launch and want to make the best of whatever we can get. The other 2 would like to level alone on release till lvl 18-19 and prepare for the LAN which will start with DM and a smooth weekend
---
Thats their anti cheat, not an issue at all
---
I’d like to think that they’re looking at the amount of active beta users when sending out new invitations. Assuming this, you’re doing us all a favor by staying inactive
---
human female casters in non-robe cloth gear looks awesome in my opinion.  When I picture adventuring mages and the like I imagine them in this kind of practical clothing, rather than cumbersome robes that can get caught on things and whatnot
---
It very much depends on family.  Trust me, you wouldn't say that about family like mine.
---
I've been through a lot of changes in philosophy over the years when it's come to binds. Early on my goal was to have zero modifiers (shift, Ctrl, alt etc) and I think it's a good thing to strive for I think ultimately it requires you to rely on mice, keyboards etc which you might not always have. A few years ago I decided to get rid of my naga/g600 and k95/g15 method of binding to use something more traditional.
---
I quickly learned **alt is a terrible bind**. There's too many other functions (alt+tab, alt+f4 etc) that could fuck you. It's also close to space and it's possible to fat finger space which might stop a important cast or cause you to jump at a bad time, or in a direction you don't want to go. It's just not a good bind.
---
Clique is really good. As a healer I bind my main two heals (as a paladin flash of light and holy light) to left click and right click. In classic (or retail I guess for other things) you can add shift and Ctrl into this setup to manage ranks. So left click might be rank 6 of flash of light but shift left click is rank 4. 
---
My bound keys are q, e, r, t, f, g, z, x, c, v ,b, 1, 2, 3, 4, f1, f2, f3, f4, left click, right click, mouse 4 and mouse 5. My modifiers are shift and Ctrl. Gives me 61 binds (I don't use a modifier for the f keys)

Surely!  How else are you expected to wipe away the tears of sheer joy of having no obligations to anyone for 5 days, while being young enough to sleep 2 hours a night without repercussions???
---
I'll log in just for you Ross.
---
What does it translate to ? :D
---
Excellent.
---
What does that translate to ?
---
I think everyone with an IQ over 70 understands why the streamers got in
---
Well, of all available hunter races (inclusing alliance), tauren is clrealy the worst one, so there's that.
---
Not to mention the improved hitbox is not really an advantage, since it also pushes your deadzone forward.

Based on the notices I’ve seen about classic beta when making tickets. I’m going to say not we’ll.
---
Recovered 2 accounts this last week. Each time I made the ticket they had stuff telling you the GM’s can do nothing and know nothing about Classic Beta.
---
I might eventually do that. It would be nice to run groups as a tank for them. Would it still be fairly easy to find a guild? I plan on writing, but I don't want to have a tougher time doing it because I chose a druid. You know, watered-down classes and all.
---
I'm in the same boat, bro.  Burnout is my worry.  I keep wanting to login and playtest, but I'm planning to hit it like a cheerleader once it drops in August...so I'm afraid of burning myself out by playing too much now.
---
They really oughta let us create characters at specific levels, because I'd be willing to go around and test some different things at my leisure - dungeons, certain zones, etc.
---
It really wasn't

Is horde version available? Those aliance boring places are just that...boring.
---
Barrens
---
I can't answer on which set is best but wolfshead is worth it, even if you can only power shapeshift for half the fight it's still a big increase to your dps. you can use mana pot and other consumable to last longer but you'll eventually oom before the end of the fight.
---
I tried to look on the internet but couldn't find any info on the shadowcraft set bonus working for druid, are you sure it does?
---
I was only there for WoD launch.  I thought it went really smooth.

Wrong

Great Stuff Josh, as usual!

It's not a given, but you want 10-12 warlocks+mages, 4-5 rogues, 10+ warriors (tanks and dps), ~ 10 healers, 1 hunter and flex around 5 slots, which you'd rather fill with more warriors, rogues and mages, which are overpopulated anyway, so there's never a shortage, rather than hunters.
---
Just keep sword and shield on. Put your tps gear on and just fight in zerker with shield slam and dump with he/cleave

I could even create character after servers were up on the beta pvp server. I wanted to play today but I couldn't find it anymore. I wrote to blizzard and they told me to go on classic forum, but I can't post there bcus I didn't have lvl 10 on my acc on classic.
---
yeah, Silverpine forrest would be the best. Only 1 race here, as Orc/Troll &amp; Tauren all meet up in the Barrens, so will be super crowded.  You could get to level 15-17 pretty easily, then can head over to the Barrens.
---
Do you need more upvotes Kusmariini? I can make one more or shall we wait a while?
---
Maybe I was just bad, but as a fire mage I was able to take anybody out easily, but if a rogue or warrior got the jump on me I died fast.

Both are needed and sought after for different reasons.  
---
Ultimately if you want to dps roll warlock, if you want to heal roll priest, as both are just as needed Alliance side.
---
Once I hit level 10ish, I'm taking my "secret" shortcut to darkshore. ;) Everyone's gonna be in Loch Modan or Westfall, so I'll avoid all that mess.
---
listen, guys. customer service literally **cannot** grant beta access. only the developers are able to flag accounts. even if a customer service rep wanted to, they do not have the capability to do so.
---
You can't exactly "battle ress" in vanila like you can in retail.
---
You have to cast the soulsone while your target is still alive
---
Well, hunters steal weapons from warriors so this is a fair trade 😂😂

Thanks, this is awesome! Looks like I missed some good bracers in my Cadaverous set-up and I have way possibly overvalued both set effects. I am still dubius about all this as I am yet to see any rigours testing or math.
---
In regards to the helm no one has mentioned running out of mana to shapeshift however I have only seen shapeshifting on short fights in youtube videos.
---
Anyway thanks again!
---
Background:
---
Lost my original hard drive that I used years and years ago. I really thought I lost all screens I took from WoW. Earlier tonight someone reminded me about Photobucket. I decided to give it a shot and managed to log on my OLD account. Only had this one pic. It’s the only and very last screen I have from old school wow. 
---
I know it’s BC not classic but this is very special to me. Eyedrool was my IRL friend from early high school. We did everything together. Video games we were split sometimes. I loved RPGs and he was all about sports games. 
---
He made fun of me for trying wow. He made fun of me for continuously playing it for several more months then a year. I finally managed to convince him to give it a shot with Refer a Friend. 
---
Got him to try a hunter. At first he didn’t like it. But as he leveled, he changed. Began to really appreciate how you had to work for everything and while it could be a challenge, it was very rewarding. 
---
He was hooked. 
---
BC was the perfect time for him to start I believe. We raided and PvP’d together for years through thick and thin, expansion to expansion. We would go to the bar and have a few beers, then head back home and start our Eye raid. 
---
I’ve had more friends since, they come and they go. I’ve felt strong connections to each one and each one is/was unique in their own way. 
---
But you always remember your first. Eyedrool if you’re reading this man, I miss ya. Come back with me this August. 
---
Also fuck your Wing Clip.
---
If anything kills classic it will be because the game is stale after 18 months because there’s no balance patches or content added to a 15 year old game. 
---
Gonna be cool when the meta is so set in stone and people are still spamming #nochanges while warriors make up 25/40 spots of a raid.

Yes, that is what I said...
---
OMG that is the greatest idea ever.  My son has been curious about WoW - he's now my weekend farmer while I do those chores my wife keeps telling me about.
---
I mean, who cares if the lawn is long enough to grab people as they walk by?
---
Ah I believe you. I was going off of my experience with my first 60. I remember being short at 40, but I did upgrade all skills and took my time with herbalism.
---
 !remindme 82 days
---
I hadnt even realized this had changed, but watching the video definitely does feel 'right'.  Man, its been a while.

What a great idea! Every time I watched it in the past I had cravings for old school WoW. Perfect way to ignite the hype, cheers!

Could you PM me an invite please

I play a rogue,
---
The first 8 thunderfuries should go to tanks.
---
Depends whether you're looking for one of the top guilds on the server that speedrun and whatnot. Generally you won't have a problem, healers are always in demand. 
---
The private server mentality of "u only ned 2 druids just bring 20 warriors" isn't really relevant for most guilds
---
Great, now im hungry :(
---
Gonna take it slow, chilling, fishing, watching the chaos, and maybe grabbing skinning to get mass amounts of leather from all the dead animals.
---
Is that a juicero
---
The highlight of my Wednesdays, keep it up Josh. You're a legend.
---
This is probably the best argument I've seen against what I feel and thank you for typing it up.  
---
Your first paragraph is on point.  Having fun is the #1 goal.  I would add that in anything there comes a price point where it becomes 'not worth it', no matter how fun.  In this case, WoW is my #1 computer game perhaps that I've ever played in my 25+years of gaming, so I clearly enjoy it.  I am willing to pay, and have already paid what.. $500+ for several years of subscription costs and a couple expansions.  
---
*In this scenario*, I just think that the price itself is unreasonable given the context of: 
---
1.  Re-release of a 15-year old game with no significant changes (NOCHANGES!)
---
2.  The previous rationale for sub costs was ongoing development in the form of significant expansions, content, gameplay balancing, class abilities, etc.  None of this is happening with Classic, aside from basic maintenance and GM support, new bug fixes, or perhaps minor QOL upgrades on the engine or support infrastructure which I would argue is required of any AAA release to maintain their trust from the playerbase.  Obviously all of these things are still happening with the *retail* game, and I think it's just a great opportunity for Blizz to attach Classic to retail and thus get as many folks paying the full sub as possible.  
---
I totally GET IT from Blizz perspective.  They want money, healthy sub counts, etc.  
---
You're also correct, I think that WoW being sub-based actually helps maintain a 'devoted' playerbase.  And obviously, keeping microtx or WoW tokens out of classic is a core part of what this community wants to see.  I've played other games where Microtx ruin it by making it super easy to pay to win.  Classic is kind of antithetical to that, it's all about putting in the work to obtain the special items/status.  In my opinion, Blizz is asking for too much by making Classic cost the same as retail and will be turning away some players by doing so.  I think they are being greedy, and that it would be better for the game to have a lower price point (still a sub, sure, but a lower amount) to get a greater amount of people into it and keep the community strong and vibrant.  
---
Perhaps down the road they will lower the cost, who knows.  But I can guarantee you, there'd be a lot more people coming back on board if it was $5/month, or a $30 purchase and then $3/month or something like that, and I think it'd be simply *more fun* to have 2x or 3x the playerbase than what I fear will happen with the full cost of sub- plenty of tourists for 3 months and then huge chunks of people decide their $15/month isn't worth it and move on. 
---
Regarding the emotions.. I try not to get emotional but I think if you notice anytime this topic comes up the majority of responses are "LOL u so poor" or calling me / any that agree with me various names, etc.  It has kind of baffled me why people would come down so hard on me for that of all reasons.  Are they proud somehow that they can afford $15/month and want to express how great their IRL auctioneer or grinding skills are?  =P
---
Thanks for the thoughtful response.
---
I get why theyre doing it, but i really wish the streamers would say which servers theyre going to be on so i can avoid them :(
---
I don't know why I laughed so hard at this, but there ya go.  Have an upvote.
---
I was just thinking of rewatching this while i wait for classic.
---
Alot of the stuff this guy is doing wont be possible in Classic because he is charging up reck bombs off screen and blowing people up with it. The whole sit crit thing from random mobs in the game doesn't work on beta and wont work in Classic unfortunately.
---
No it’s not
---
I play horde. 
---
But if I wasn't a raging gnome hater and had to play alliance I'd take escape artist over perception any day !
---
Powershifting becomes a must in raids as far as I know. You will need to use the helm, mana potion and demonic/dark runes to keep up with mana
---
You might want to lookup Shedo the Druid on youtube to see how it works in raid setup
---
But ye thinking about it its cool... especially for the seeking tigers in strangelton vale.
---
Neither BoE nor BoP, as most white items, dosen't bound
---
As a horde, I always type "bur" thinking ally woud see "lol".
---
TIL
---
Yeah, I like watching some of their streams, just don't want to be on that server.  Also, whenever they decide the next big game is better to stream and all jump ship that server will die instantly.
---
I played on Uldum-US. Our main tank "Tribulation" had both Hand of Ragnaros and Thunderfury. He was DPS so he got Sulfuras, then he became our main tank and got TF.
---
When he had to spirit rez with both weapons in his inventory, he would pay like 90g. 
---
He eventually got banned, lel.
---
Bro NO, ok? It was all the GODS at the private servers. There is *no* way blizzard could've ever found a way to make classic if they didn't consult the private servers creators. 
---
It's up to the reader to add the "/s" if you so choose.
---
How bug free was the nost experience?
---
I’ve played on the stress test and on some private servers and the private servers are just a complete mess even tho they been up for years
---
I never played on nost tho
---
This is still assuming you're raiding with a group who wants to optimize completely.
---
The first day isn't a factor.
---
Barrens is better though fwiw.
---
Silverpine based on the fact that any alt you make outside of undead will naturally be going to the Barrens.
---
&gt; since they do more than competitive DPS and on top of that they can summon, battle res, provide free health potions, cc
---
But you did lol
---
Absolutely. Still feel kinda bad for those that dont
---
At 1g a pop, it'll be a while before you're handing them out for free!
---
Good. Vanilla blizzlike
---
What's the announcement for recommencement?
---
The OSRS sub is basically a gigantic meme/shit post sub and I love it.
---
What brought us here was the low sub count lol and the content drought after 8.2 when blizz will use classic in between patches to release the classic tiers. $$$$
---
That why you play together
---
Still saving all my grime encrusted objects tho
---
Fuck the police
---
That depends if you want to heal or dps
---
Mage/Warlock/Hunter all do pretty well in both pve and pvp as range.  Easiest ride would be mage because you need like 10 of them per raid but honestly i wouldnt worry about finding spots as a hunter or warlock either.
---
Non binding
---
yeah! and 2 /per materials its the minimum. you can get 3/4 too.
---
I do love how they post it in the classic sub to be all hey guys look what you can't do
---
Goddamnit.
---
I had decided to main hunter, but I've been thinking about a Warlock more and more. Pretty much the same leveling and Warlock brings so much utility. Not to mention that free mounts and much more late game damage. I remember reading through the manual as the game installed and deciding on a Paladin because I thought their buffs would be super useful in groups... feel like I should play Lock due to that reason. But I also enjoy the feeling of playing melee/physical attacks more in most games...
---
Shit I thought I had this all figured out lol. Maybe I'll start by playing hunter and switch if I decide partway through?
---
Graveyard Exalted
---
I'll be playing a druid. Going for Feral Tank/Flex DPS. Useful auras, can actually taunt. Make a good decurse bot if need be. Mostly want to offtank raids and tank 5-mans. I just can't decide on Night Elf or Tauren. Slight leaning towards Night Elf since I can't Tauren Stomp in Bear Form.
---
You’ll be able to find groups as a solid dps, you just might have to wait around for a tank or healer for a bit
---
edit post: Guess it would be important to point out that i was an undead rogue with the name of crajy at the time! @ me bruh!
---
Get in the van is always a good go to.
---
What else we going to play classic
---
The world just looks so much more vibrant. The colors are deeper, the lighting is better. I'm pumped as fuck to rediscover everything.
---
If you want high skill in raids the rogue &gt; mage as you have actual rotations and cooldowns to manage.
---
For pvp a naked mage still has options while rogues have a rough time in BGs but can do insane things in wpvp.
---
Would you fuck me?
---
I'd fuck me so hard
---
vanillafriends.com
---
I used to type ”d a p EE BB” in retail vanilla pvp
---
And now I remember why people were excited for flying in TBC. But all we got was air swimming
---
“If it doesn’t scan it must be free” is the most hated “joke” heard by retail people.  This is just the Blizzard GM equivalent.  They’re at work and you’re not going to be seen as funny for wasting their time.
---
Yeah, you learn a lot of new things from the translator. Apparently You (Horde) say I c I and Alliance will read l o l . :)
---
I didn't say you can battle res like you can in bfa, I said you can battle res, which is true, regardless if you apply it before or during. Don't try to strawman a stupid argument for the sake of arguing.
---
People are stupid
---
You are amazing. Thank you!
---
fair enough
---
Doesn't bound
---
10 man strat, niiicccccceeee.
---
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
---
It probably wont work atm. There is some weird divide by zero error people are getting that is causing it to crash.
---
Okay. I was just trying to brainstorm.
---
Amazing! I used to farm cloths and BGs for my older brother when I was 11, and before that he would have me help him farm stuff on runescape. It was a great deal, he would get me awesome snacks, and one time he bought me game cube for the help! Little kids are the best bots.
---
Thank you for my new discord server image. This is amazing
---
Who are these people with Dave?
---
A N A L
---
Rolled night elf druid on my most recent adventure and completed everything. Now guild is probably rolling horde -- what should I roll if not a druid? Someone recommended warrior but I'm also considering shaman. Will I be disappointed by any of the two?   
---
Played shaman late tbc through cataclysm where I quit. And warrior late classic to tbc.  
---
Enjoyed the survivability and potential to clever form shifting with druids and ranked to 11, but spent most of the actual time after that as resto.
---
Pretty sure they’re like 10 or 25s
---
It's otherwise assuming said raid can't find more warriors, mages, warlocks or rogues, while 3 of those are the top 3 most played classes.  
---
But yes, ideally you'd take any of the 4 over hunter, but if you truly can't, you might as well carry them through the raid, since a hunter is better than nothing or a hybrid.
---
I am for sure doing this, I had to compete with my brother and dad for playtime during vanilla so im doing warrior with mining and blacksmithing and plan on making gear for myself because i will leveling solo with dungeons when i can get groups.
---
I’ll be honest o prefer the silhouette and horns of the original but the textures are certainly better
---
KeK
---
haha thank you! I'm glad I could evoke some emotions :)
---
I’d love to see video evidence of this because it’s theoretically impossible.
---
this is why vanilla was hard.  let's see these 1337 players kick ass on 800x600 res with 17fps and 300ms ping
---
&gt;1 6 1 3  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I see you going places, especially STV \^\^
---
The "nochanges" is supposed to be to get as close to old blizzard as possible without having new blizzard fuck up the game. Why do people always assume that means no one wants new content? Of course any one in their right mind would, but do you really trust the new content from new blizzard?
---
Please just let people enjoy a game in a stale genre proven to be good for a little before blizzard fucks it up with their incompetence.
---
Of course that it was never realistic. But the changes in animations definitely brought a more childish tone to the expressiveness of characters.
---
And I'm not saying it's bad, it's simply different. By the way the WC3 reforged team explicitly said they will try to avoid this. And as you have seen, that still does not mean they went for realism. Simply stylized characters.
---
get out my thread =(
---
Do bags count?
---
Good
---
thank you comment
---
god bless you
---
There are Speedrun guides for Vanilla out there. I'd look up some of those. They may or may not be neglecting any outside assistance.
---
Just be aware that you have to stay in "Casual-/Fun"-Guilds.
---
Druid and Palas are just Lackluster compared to Warrior Tanks, and have to be perfectly played with the right Items to climb into the Top 15 DPS (And that only if the other Guys are lazy or sleeping).
---
Sounds harsh but its something to know before you start playing.
---
we make our own content &gt;:)
---
Not really looking to speedrun anything in Classic to be honest. Just kind of want to take it all in with some friends and eventually progress.
---
I remember getting buzzed in ashenvale way back when, just reminds you there are accrual players in the world.
---
Hey, he's big boned :(
---
If you re going to be main tank of the guild, you'll never be alone. Mining can also make decent gold
---
!!!!
---
Very minute class balances, just a use for ret pally, prot pally, balance druid, and enh shaman. Also increase number of debuff as in later expacks, which corrects most of locks and shadowpriests.
---
It'd be nice to see more arena zones like STV, maybe some associated quests or items, but no formal arena.
---
If take an Azshara battleground over eye of the storm. 
---
I've always been interested in what could be in that area in eastern wetlands, guarded by the dragon. Dun something. Also, it feels like there could be a coast South of ungoro. There are a lot of map areas unfinished or otherwise inaccessible. These all seem more relevant to have than an isolated outlands.
---
I'm torn between Mage (human) and Druid. I want to focus on eventually doing raids and would prefer an in demand class. 
---
Druid seems better for leveling (I think the AOE spots might be crowed at launch) and I enjoy the class fantasy and healing doesn't seem to bad.  
---
Mage seems to be tuned a bit better, the QOL of life with portals seems amazing and they do seem to be pretty wanted in raids. The gear wait list seems to be pretty dang long though once you are actually in a raiding guild. Life outside of raids also seems to be a bit better. 
---
I also am playing from overseas so going to have a 200ish ping if that matters
---
&gt;weapon speed, slow weap rock biter fast one flame tongue, windfury 
---
But you forget overkilling. With 2H a big overkill is much worse
---
Anyone who gets the scepter is being carried by their entire guild, streamer or not. I'd rather the journey be captured on video I suppose.
---
Oh yeah I guess you are right. Well too late know I guess hopefully they will forgive me for it.
---
Optimized questing route with strategic grinding unless you're able to get ahead of the pack on a class capable of AoE grinding at early-mid levels.
---
Keep in mind that warlocks are the most threat sensitive class in the game and without blessing of salvation it becomes an even bigger problem.
---
Not sure if it works for druid or not but I assumed it would. There's not a lot of complete information out there for classic which is kind of fun
---
Same, thought to myself "weekly topic? I'm gonna wonder this EVERYDAY for the next 10 WEEKS!"
---
I'm 99% sure they're 1g. Will have to check next stress test but I remember it from back in the day myself, and privates/online DBs say the same.
---
Neyes
---
Depends if you care about damage on charts in mc and early bwl. Warlock dps in the early raids is comical.
---
It actually wasn't the best. It launched at very opportune moment and the hype train rolled there. Essentially K server had been building massive hype. Then Nost (which was an unknown project) rushed their launch. They essentially took that hype which was smart. K server was better, but people weren't about to reroll for slightly better scripting and slightly less bugs.
---
I know mate. I was a warrior tank in original vanilla too. I levelled a hunter for a reason :p
---
Although i was pretty crap back then, hence why i wanted to find out if i was just bad, or if i was bad AND my class was bad at it as well xD
---
Are you me? I'm torn between all 3 cloth classes... It's such a tough choice, and I don't know how I will choose. Currently my rankings are:    
---
Warlock    
---
Mage    
---
Priest (Only below mage because of being forced to heal a lot)
---
I like your optimism that this meme is going to live longer than a month.
---
When raiding in naxxramas for example on multiple servers all of my guild mates with PCs that run every new game on max settings with at least 120fps all had to lower the view distance to the minimum. Otherwise we got stutters and freezes from time to time. A lot of people have e this issue.
---
Cuqboi.
---
man beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder because to me the characters look like they are made of paper mache and the textures are so pixelated it hurts to look at.
---
No problem :)
---
I suppose you did this late in vanilla then, with a very well developed economy when people were able to pay such prices. 
---
I've been playing on a couple of private servers where the size of the server and the relative freshness of the server could be comparable to what classic will be like. If you could even farm 10g/hour doing anything you were doing very well for yourself. 
---
I'm not saying deadmines is not a good farm spot I'm saying it will NOT take 2 hours to get gold for your first mount. It's gonna be a bit of a grind for everyone unless you join the server a year down the line.
---
Damn ez mode alliance.
---
the horde warriors don't start going dual wield until much later in the game.  The original poster was asking about pre raid gear.
---
I'm curious about how accurate the proportions are compared to the in-game maps. Have you algo-rendered [the elwynn comparison](https://www.classicmaps.xyz/WoW%20maps/Comparisons/comparison2.png) based on the "cartoony" ingame map or the "satellite view" map that teeb provided?
---
I'm developing an open source leveling guide ([vanilla-questing.me](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/)) that's available to anyone and would love to upgrade the trash tier maps I'm currently using. The images wouldn't have to be of super high fidelity either which should cut down on the render time significantly. The ingame coordinate system is percentage based tho, so the proportions have to be within acceptable range.
---
Let me know if there's something I can assist you with!
---
Find a guild that takes gold/arcane bars in exchange for DKP and that pays for the tanks consumables leaving the tank to only cover their repair bill. 1-2 living strat runs a week with the first orb reserved is enough to cover that.
---
Also the blizzcon client for classic ran a lot better than the 1.12
---
from what i can tell the only class capable of aoe grinding is mage, or is this only at early levels? i would assume hunter would be viable once you have volley
---
&gt;Or do people just think that doing a combination of mob grinding, questing and instances when appropriate is the fastest way, and that sticking to one entirely would be putting yourself at a disadvantage. 
---
Nail on the head here, and it always depends. Some dungeons while lvling have loads of quests associated with them, others have 1 or 2 that may not be worth it. The best time to grind mobs is walking between quests, or going a bit over on the quest mobs you are killing if the area has a low enough player population. Certain lvls it will be more efficient to grind then to run all over trying to do quests that are on the opposite ends of the world.
---
Don’t understand people who want to rush to 60. I will take my time and do dungeons, world pvp, exploring etc. There is not much to do at lvl 60 in phase 1 anyway. :)
---
I don't think you'd be able to get that many levels in silverspine unless you plan on grinding a fair bit
---
What this guy said completely. You just randomly getting crit isn't a good thing. Being able to control the crits are exactly what make this build good. 
---
Leaving crits up to RNG usually means you're going to have either under 100% uptime on enrage, or OVER 100% uptime which is then basically you taking way more damage than you eed to.
---
I need advice on how to decide what to play throughout all phases (horde)... warlock, mage or warrior
---
I'm wanting to do a lot of group play with the guild i join, raids, premade bgs, world pvp/bosses. Also into solo play like farming methods for gold, class specific/unique ways of making gold also could be convincing depending on how good they are.
---
Yeah, this is also making me remember that the stretch of leveling dungeons from Gnomer through SM was great, from all the upgrades to the flavors of the instances. Like, those instances are still the most vivid in my mind next to the ones like Scholo, UBRS and MC
---
I played mage in vanilla and Druid in Wrath. both raided end game (naxx) and ICC 25 heroic... both are sweet! I think druids will be more niche and have more utility. Mages are awesome but there will be tons of them. Won't be surprised if its the most popular class.
---
The problem is the polygon count with the older models. They are rather hideous before WoD, but it would be nice if they updated the polygon count and updated the textures.
---
Hate to be a grumpers but anyone else feel like they should not keep upping the level cap on beta?
---
I don't want everything to be streamed before live, it kinda ruins the hype in a way. I'd really be bummed to see people running my favorite end game dungeons before we get to officially play :/
---
lol that garr screenshot. do you want some mmo with your UI? nice uploads
---
With 16 debuffs, this should be a decent list of what you can expect to have on a boss:
---
 - Sunder Armor / Expose (they don't stack and overwrite each other)
---
 - Demo Shout
---
 - Thunderclap / TF weapon proc ( I can't remember if these stack or if one overwrites the other)
---
 - Faeirie Fire
---
 - Cos
---
 - CoE
---
 - CoR/W
---
 - Hunter's Mark
---
 - Nightfall weapon proc
---
 - Gift of Arthas (from the MT)
---
 - Winter's Chill / Scorch
---
 - Imp Shadow Bolt
---
So, this will be pretty standard throughout the entire endgame raiding expereince. But, with better gear, more debuff slots will be reserved for others things such as:
---
 - Hunter 8/8 T2 proc
---
 - Ignite
---
Then you have raid specific comps that will dictate debuff priority. For example, if your group has a single Shadow Priest (or, if you have a priest lucky enough to raid as shadow) they get 2 or 3 debuffs just for themselves in the form of:
---
 - Shadow Weaving
---
 - Mindflay 
---
 - Shadow word: Pain (this one is conditional)
---
If a boss requires a tank swap, or if a tank has to get back aggro from an overzealous dps, then Taunt/Mocking Blow take up a slot as well. Since these have the highest debuff priority, they will knock off whatever debuff has the lowest priority. 
---
This isn't even an exhaustive list and its more dependent on raid comps than you may think. Hell, even faction can have a play in it because you may have to have one of your paladins Judge wisdom so all the casters can wand back some mana. 
---
So, yes, one **MAYBE** two debuff slots are free for Corruption. But that's it.  
---
&gt; Also a lock with a Nightfall is most likely SM/Ruin, which means no improved imp.
---
Not necessarily. Again, raid comps dictate this sort of stuff. If your tanks want improved imp and you have warlocks fighting for that last raid slot... guess what? The one who specc'd for it got the slot. I should know, I was the one who had both improved HS and improved imp. Sure, my damage wasn't topping the charts, but when invites went out, I was always the first warlock invited. And when the other warlocks complained because they felt like they were better than me our MT would say the same thing every time:  
---
"Are you willing to have your imp out the entire raid? If the answer is no, than Cord is coming with us."
---
This is what horde see if written by alliance.
---
r/wowservers for pserver data.
---
For fun wise Druid is the funnest class I have leveled. If you get bored of one play style you can easily switch it up on a Druid. You have speed boost at level 20 (if you spec into it) and travel form at level 30 making a level 40 mount not as dire. Also stealth for those bathroom breaks and sneaking by enemies. 
---
The downside to Druid is no reliable res and no instant boom damage abilities.
---
Looked verry different on my phone, my bad.
---
It‘s crazy! This game is from 2004 and still so darn beautiful!
---
Skinning is the most efficient low level gold making in the game by far. You kill tons of skinnable creatures while leveling, and vendor the leather for pure profit. It's basically "extra loot" the profession. Herb and mining require you go out of your way to find nodes, putting your leveling process on hold while you rank them up.
---
doing quests is still a fast way to level. You get a lot of XP for completing quests and have to kill so many mobs, so are grinding too.   Main thing is to just put the time in and get on. You'll never keep up with the speed runners, but will be ahead of the normal curve if you play a lot. 
---
Grinding is good, especially if you can find a good spot and go for it. I used to like to find caves or such and head in ginding. Even finding spots out of the way, can work. So grind between levels and you can easily keep leveling fast. I used to hate starting a new zone, without leveling 1st.  so I'd find a spot to grind out till I newly dinged, then would go train and then start my new zone.
---
A small section of the community will have issues with it.
---
This may be wild speculation, but maybe they want to have fun
---
🦀🦀🦀
---
Because DS is the single most miserable warlock build to play outside of raids, and requires you to run without a pet. SM/ruin trades +5% on your shadow bolts for a strong group stam buff and a wide variety of utility options from the Affliction tree.
---
Oh I posted similar thoughts before seeing this. Yea I totally agree.
---
I really want them to keep the end game saved for release. Its like unveiling a shiny new car to everyone at a car show or something. Lol.. Seems corny but yea I totally agree.
---
I still love using the emote spams.
---
They're 1g base before rep discounts.
---
same here.
---
We're on a mission from God!
---
Gasp not strangers
---
Try 1 6 1 3
---
I think 17 1 6 1 3 means no a n a l
---
I don't expect to be super hardcore, mainly be 3rd position tank when needed. From what I can tell, its also easier for a Feral tank to go DPS than for a DPS warrior to go tank. Aura is still good for a slot to boost those warrior numbers up too.
---
I REALLY hope this is not an issue in Classic. It’s one of the reasons I don’t enjoy many MMOs now, the public push to everyone to play meta builds only.
---
I get it. Dibs.
---
Pretty sure you are wrong. They do cost 1g.
---
Naxx isn’t available in Classic at the moment.  You’re using an example of a raid that isn’t available for testing to prove that Classic runs worse than Live?
---
when i say "rush to 60" i dont mean im not going enjoy my leveling experience and ignore things, I just really enjoy end game content and want to attempt pushing for server firsts
---
Yeah, sure.. 👍🏻
---
It's gonna be impossible to totally duplicate that feeling. And since they wouldn't be breaking the TOS, there's really nothing stopping them. I'll tell myself that those people will be few and far between, because who's going to want to give up their hard earned Classic gold in exchange for easily obtainable BFA gold? I can't imagine too many people. Regardless, I'd never do it myself, and I don't plan on interacting with anyone who would.
---
Heheh this was on Frostmourne, don't recall the guild at the time but most likely it was Collateral. I remember the character's name had something to do with frogs, but other than that I'm drawing a blank.
---
Level 40 is BIG. Correct me if I'm wrong but at this level there should be some actual nice and hard-to-farm epics like Kang, Staff of Jordan, Dragon's Call etc right? And also just thinking of all the new dungeons that will be available. Are there are any BIS lists up for 40?
---
You put it in until lvl 34 according to the best rogue levellers like LMGD
---
Ahhh the classic “don’t play faster than me! I’m intimidated and jealous of that!” comment! Haven’t seen this in 26 minutes!
---
As long as in 2 weeks we are not reading his posts on how there isn’t anything to do in Classic more power to him!
---
That's fair. I love how in Preach's Legacy of the Warlock vid he makes the comment that the class just does so much that people are still to this day arguing about how to optimally play it. I think it's the reason that people love the class so much. Warlock's objective power level is fairly middle of the road, but the class is just so customizable between gearing and talents that you can make it god-tier for the environment you care about.
---
Everyone here is giving shit answers. The real answer is which one looks the coolest? Because if you don’t look cool doing it what’s the fucking point?
---
6 Expanisions later you would have to wait for this not to 1shot. Nice.
---
I agree, and i wouldn’t like to see those rules carrying forward especially at 60 when the classes have their full kits. But i can see why they did it at 30. Stealth is so bad that it would be near impossible or take forever to actually get an opener vs someone who knows what they’re doing. If they don’t get an opener they have even less of a chance than they did  previously, which as we saw, wasn’t a very good chance to begin with. I’m curious what you thought about the 20 yard rule? Do you think classes like warriors should have been able to start the duel right on top of opponents or deadzone hunters immediately etc?
---
If you’re playing in a semi hardcore or hardcore guild your probably going to have issues with getting him a permanent raid spot, but if you’re just aiming for casual raiding then it should be more than fine.
---
if you don't mind healing, shaman are great raid healers. They're also fun in pvp with any spec.
---
play rogue
---
My dancing in Classic is why my ret out DPS’d such a massive number of people. It wasn’t often someone did more than me and usually they had better gear. I wouldn’t say it’s trivial at all. It’s more on the imperative side of things.
---
Those are kind of opposites in some ways. Mages will be super popular, but also super useful, so it might even out to be a middle of the road class in terms of getting a raid spot. 
---
Druids are the least popular class by far, but they also have limited raid spots, so not that different in the end. 
---
If I were you, I would go Druid if you're focused on raids, because healing is a lot more interesting and skillful than spamming Frostbolt, you don't have to conjure water, and you will get gear extremely quickly.
---
Since they are locked to your account, does this mean that if you ‘reserve’ a name on an alt on launch day and then down the track you want that name on your main, you can just delete your alt and then go ahead with the name change to your main within the 60 days? 
---
I hope that makes sense lol
---
There are going to be so many warlocks this time around
---
I'm stuck between these two also. I want to do hunter for the nice crits and ranged damage. But I think rogue is more exciting to play. The downside of rogues to me is the long cooldowns for pvp and not being super userful outside of my opener. I can't decide!
---
Won't bother to answer cause I can't educate them all. Keep your opinion. Other people do have their own.
---
Number of Hunters in Raid will get reduced to 2 after some Time.  Keep that in Mind.
---
Of course Warlock does a LOT more dmg after the first couple MC clears. Most Hunters don't use all the Potential their Class has tho. But you'll probably never be in the Top 10.
---
Keep in Mind Hunter has other Aspects of the Game that makes it an interesting Class. Great PVP, Kiting.
---
Soul link spec
---
At least I can see the mob you are fighting in this one.
---
Nice try!
---
kind of unrelated: did they fix the issues with pets becoming depressed after every bg?
---
One of the benefits to dual monitor is that, if I play a game in fullscreen, I can still look at the second monitor.  I've got a program that extends the taskbar over there (I think Win10 does that now, but not as good as this program does), but I've also got a "sidebar" for Windows that shows time, weather, CPU/RAM usage, stuff like that.  Nice big numbers to see what time it is.
---
But I have thought about putting an LED clock above my TV for when I'm playing console games.
---
Let’s hope we can still hop on stables roof.
---
Threat meters are pretty much necessary for even an acceptable level of play at end game.
---
First one yes, while we were doing Tethis at level 30 we could see alliance flying from Stormwind &gt; duskwood &gt; booty bay route fly over us as the normal "blue" name as if they are pvp inactive (because on flightpath)
---
no clue about the /say thing
---
Are we also going to ban streaming the game on twitch and limit people to using thottbot only for game help?
---
Really get that 2004 feel
---
^^maybe  ^^guild ^^banks ^^too?
---
My empiric evidence it was not 80% chance of getting the xbow.  This was from 270 days of sub time or 9 months of raiding during BWL, Aq, and Nax raiding.
---
Sub in a nutshell when you try to be the best player you can be.
---
I'm not going to name names, but if you're talking about who I think you're talking about, that streamer is a friggin idiot.  
---
In order to generate threat as a tank, you need to hit the mobs. If the mobs are 10+ levels higher than you, you're going to have your attacks dodge/parried/resisted/whatever. If you don't land a hit, then you don't generate threat. This is the reason why people are spamming in that streamer's chat to spam Battle Shout.  
---
Since buffing your party generates threat, all that rage the streamer used just to have their attacks dodge/parried/whatever could have gone into spamming Battle Shout. The streamer would not have had to worry about their attacks missing, because the threat generated is from buffing the party, thus no wonky attack checks are done.   
---
Is it an efficient use of rage? No, the threat/rage generation from Battle Shout is nothing compared to landing actual attacks on the mobs. Is it an **effective** use? You bet! Better to build up some threat by spamming Battle Shout than to have all you attacks that would generate threat dodge/parried/resisted/whatever.   
---
TL:DR, if you're fighting mobs at level, open with Battle Shout and use it just enough to keep the buff up. When fighting things that you can't hit, spam dafuq out of Battle Shout.
---
Don’t you basically always get stunned/dazed if you have Cheetah up?
---
Never seen a hunter successfully AoE grind level in my life, so I assume it's not possible, I totally might be wrong though.   
---
    
---
I was thinking of prot/holy paladins outside of mages.   
---
But it has held true from what I've seen and experienced, most classes do a mix of questing and strategic grinding. Some quests are gonna be a pain in the butt, but sometimes you can cut down the difficulty/time spent doing it drastically by simply being a single level higher so instead of moving on to a different area with slightly easier/faster quests it can be a good move to simply stay and grind a good area until the next level-up.
---
Not really
---
it's not good enough compared to escape artist though
---
You can apply shield tho.
---
Yes, mate got his account banned for being a dick. was pretty funny.
---
Imp revenge is kind of worthless for tanking in most raids. I guess its nice for SOME trash later on, but not early phases for raiding. Dungeoning? Sure it can be useful.
---
I'm currently at work so I can't see the talent tree /u/BullDogSC2 made but I can list off the talents. 
---
**Arms:**  
---
Imp Rend 3/3
---
Parry 3/5

Huh are the api’s for retail the same as classic?
---
I see a lot of fantasising and unrealistic expectations on this subreddit. The number of people who had high-end raid content on lock, farming legendaries regularly for their guild, attaining R14 in PvP, etc, were really *very* low. On established servers you'd see maybe 5-10 people per faction with a legendary active at any one time; and there would only be a handful of rank13/14 players, too. Reading this sub gives one the impression that everyone is going to be in a server-best guild for raiding or premades, which is obviously unrealistic for so many reasons.
---
That is exactly what I am in it for, why rush something I have waited over a decade for?
---
I get the hype for Classic-only WoW, but I'd kill for a TBC-only WoW.
---
My vacation is next week. I booked it off months ago. And fuuuuck changing it now. I need that fucking vacation. I'll just play wow after work and on weekends.
---
They said they srent going to be inviting many more people. Almost nobody. Stupid to sub for a beta chance imo.
---
yes but only if you are hit, not your pet, and as a hunter you're not really taking damage unless you're doing something wrong. having said that, i would toggle between hawk and cheetah and mostly just used nature shot and auto shoot so mana wasn't an issue
---
I flag carried for one of them from time to time -- but I wasn't a hardcore battlegrounds guy.  I was more about the raiding and the world pvp shenanigans.  
---
Figured out what to roll yet?
---
Ultimately people will only keep playing a game if they're are having fun and enjoying it. He could pick shaman and love playing it no matter what he's doing and keep on playing for a long time, or he could pick "meta class" and while he might perform better or be brought in more groups he might end up having less fun resulting in him quitting faster. Everyone should really just be playing what they enjoy.
---
I've been playing FFXIV lately (just dove back into it last week), and it's got a world that isn't flat and still looks absolutely amazing.  I was thinking while playing it that WoW would be insane if it had those kind of graphics.  Wouldn't be able to run on older machines, of course.
---
Suggestion. Have the name be and the boys. So it just uses your character name instead of me
---
&lt;Bottom Text&gt;
---
You do you. I don't understand the comments such as the one you replied to yet here we are. Don't ever apologize for whatever playstyle you find fun.
---
I fully intend to powerlevel to 60 as well.
---
We had a guild called "better dead than Smeg" a red dwarf reference. We got forced to change it, after we rejected someone to join &amp; the guild name got reported.(at least we think that's how it went down)
---
We changed it to " smoke me a kipper" so it worked out .
---
It's not too bad, unless you're coming from/to Teldrassil.
---
I want to run a rogue for PVE this time around. Any thoughts on that?
---
No, not particularly late. But maybe 4 months in from release. Grinding is going to be required for mounts as the economy isnt really set yet. But running a lower level instance (especially deadmines with hunamoids), you are the only one looting the coins from the corpses. 
---
10g an hour is very low. Evenvendoring all of the Blue BOPs you'd get a min of 3 gold. Factor in the cloth, BOE drops, the ore mined from the 5-6 nodes....and all the gray vendor trash. You'd make easily 10g a run, without a good drop (defias gear or companion pet).  As said, I found I could easily run DMs (as a hunter), at least twice in an hour, sometimes well into a 3rd run...... so was easily making 40g an hour. 
---
Maybe I was lucky, maybe not. But running low level instances for twink gear will help you farm for your level 60 mount, without question.  
---
Its just a time sink!
---
You could always level up a few guys to 20 to get a better idea for each class that you think you may like, then make a informed decision about which to take to 60.
---
If you're a first time player, I say just do what you enjoy and what sounds fun, and that means class and their talent specs. You don't have to worry about being a raid viable class or spec til later. Then, if raiding sounds interesting and fun to you, you can always respec to be more viable or reroll an alt class that is more viable/in demand. You'll learn more about that after cap and it can add new life/goals to the game as your start gearing up for raids, but it's okay to just enjoy the adventure/journey that is the leveling experience while sticking to what you find the most fun along the way.
---
Hype will die fast as fuck if the game is unplayable.
---
&gt;  in the end its a pve game 
---
"World of Friendcraft."
---
Jokes aside I don't care if people prefer PvE, but it is annoying when you guys get all moral high-groundy and act like it you are *so mature* caus you don't like pvp. Just play your preference, there's no reason to make a big deal out of it.
---
I don't think it was optimal, I think I was just lazy but I just used Hawk unless I was out of combat; then I'd use Cheetah.
---
From u/itsXennon:
---
So just FYI I’ve played vanilla wow since 04 and every year since tbc release on private servers. Up until about two years ago prior to classic wow being announced. I always play warrior, I have done the rank 14 grind as well as cleared all available content more times than I’d like to mention; so I have a strong understanding of the class in PvP and PvE. I only say this you know that I’m not making this stuff up based on nothing. Most of the private server community is toxic and either don’t help or surprisingly after years of playing still don’t know what they’re talking about.
---
Anyways to you point; best way to break this down would be as such:
---
Warrior is amazing in PvP, and very enjoyable if your play type matches. You are a vital part of any premade for BGs as you give mortal strike(reduced healing on target). You are the primary damage dealer on single targets and coordinate your groups kills.
---
If you are primarily interested in PvP warrior is a solid class, a lot of classes are. But you will be greatly hampered by not doing at least dungeons to get the gear necessary to be competitive.
---
How long will this take? That’s up to you and how much you farm gear. Once you’re 60 and running 5 and 10 mans it shouldn’t be but a few weeks till you’re BiS geared maybe sooner depending on luck with drops you need.
---
Once you are geared though you definitely will not suck, you will be the strongest dps class in raids and scary af in PvP. Given that you have a healer. Warriors alone are trash in general, but with someone to assist you they’re really strong.
---
And when I say trash I don’t mean the class, you’ll be super strong, but hunters rogues mages etc can CC you and kite you and keep you at a distance and unless you have freedom potions health potions etc you’ll have a hard time 1v1. But get a healer and you can win 1v2/3/4/5
---
So if you have a group to play with you have little to worry about. Do the standard 60 dungeons and get the appropriate gear and by phase 2 (pvp rank release) you’ll be golden for PvP. You could stick to pvp till rank 14 if you choose to grind it out and with rank 14 gear / weapons you will have gear two raids stronger in advance to normal players. Hope this helped any other questions let me know
---
Gotcha rolling druid now
---
Now kithh
---
Has anyone been able to find the profiles anywhere?
---
It can also be annoying finding trainers for cooking.
---
I would level up the feral specs first to help with leveling
---
Then use the balance specs to increase damage and fill it out with the healing before pvp
---
I also highly suggest just going feral to level and respecing in the 50’s. My young self leveled up a Druid and thought it would be fun to go balance the whole time 
---
By far the slowest leveling experience I’ve ever had
---
Paladin is a blast in PvP. Thats what I mained in vanilla. The leveling process is AWFUL. BUT, you will always have a raid healing spot, and Retribution/Holy/Protection are all fun in PvP.
---
Yeah that's why I'm leaning mage but dont warlocks have a more well rounded better experience going from raid to open world/pvp not respecing for the in between raid nights?
---
They ARE a crafty bunch....

:/
---
Depends on if you count random's with 12 viewers.
---
I will keep that in mind, never knew buffs generated threat.
---
I’m seeing some people saying going engineering is simply the best choice for every class due to added abilities. The draw back is that it’s a gold sink instead of a gold maker. Do you guys agree?
---
Only once a day? Casual!!
---
don't think there's been a confirmation yet. I could've sworn I remember the dev interviews talking how they were talking about if things like thorium point would have all of the quests that got added in later patches off the bat
---
PvE players are the WoW version of crossfit vegans, changemymind.
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
My memories are rather hazy about these - it has been 14 years after all, but I recall we actively avoided CoR/CoW, Demo Shout and ThunderClap for most of the fights, since tank damage was not an issue really. We usually had a shadow priest, but was asked to not use SW:P and I can't really recall anything about Hunter T2 procs, but I mostly didn't pay attention.
---
Still, we ran with 3 warlock, and we used 2 Corruptions and we rolled for Agony at every raidstart. 2 of us were SM/Ruin and one guy (our GM actually) used a very odd Soul Link / Destro build which had improved imp and HS amongst other things.
---
We weren't really a minmaxing guild, certain farming for progress was exeected and we killed C'Thun right before Naxx opened. We cleared spider wing, and downed all other first bosses before falling apart and merging, which lead me to quitting until Cata.
---
Druid healing is very fun in raids. Also flag carrying as a druid is really fun. If you get an early epic mount, the right utility items and are good with your shapeshifting, people will beg you to fc and be almost impossible to kill.  
---
And if leveling is important, druids are arguably faster than mages even if AoE spots are uncrowded.
---
I'll probably be downvoted for this - but I started playing in BC with the oldish character models... I much prefer the newer models. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the preservation of Classic. I just think they should revamp the textures, because I'm not particularly nostalgic when it comes to looking at 2005 textures vs what we have in 2019. It just looks bad.
---
If there was someway to keep the Classic  gameplay intact with new models I would love it.
---
I feel like this existed in vanilla. Is this a fix, or a change?
---
I haven't played a hunter in forever, but I would guess you would use it same as ghost wolf if your actively hunting mobs you leave it on, if your traveling to a new spot you throw it on
---
Switch aspects as needed. Cheetah can get you in a lot of trouble if you're not aware of your surroundings and otherwise just being hit by anything ever while in it. Being dazed/slowed and unable to get away while in it is also a terrible choice. Very inefficient to die let alone move slowly.

"Well I guess this us growing up" - Blink182
---
If he is playing casually for fun and doesn't give a shit about whatever else is happening, then why should you?
---
For some reason I'm worried it's not gonna be as fun as a druid... Might be biased because shamans were so nerfed in pvp in later expansions
---
I'm not realy sold for this build while leveling. I guess you go feral first and rest later. From my point of view it's a good build for PvP and has a lot of utility at level 60. That said you will have a harder time to level. You don't have enough points in feral to play effective as a cat and you also skiped most Balance talents for saving mana. My suggestion is look for a good leveling specc and respecc at level 60.
---
Hope a few of you classic Hunter players can answer this question I have that'll help me decide what to play. I understand that Hunter DPS is fairly weak in vanilla, particularly as the tiers go on, and a lot of this has to do with poor scaling. 
---
I am actually okay with playing a class that brings more utility than just big numbers with kiting and tranq shot etc. but my concern is I don't want to feel like I am not really progressing my character as time goes on. 
---
So my question for you vanilla or p-server players is that even though hunter scaling was poor in vanilla, did you still feel like you were progressing your hunter in a satisfying way moving from tier to tier?
---
Now all we need is DOGG. 
---
People spamming "DOGG A N A L" was a staple on my server lmao
---
Haha!
---
My thoughts exactly. Plus the respeccing will be annoying. I’ve played around with the rogue talent tree endlessly to try and find a spec that doesn’t leave you gimped for either pve or PvP and it’s tough.
---
Warlock or mage then, Warriors are not good at farming and can't solo anything interesting, and also suck at world PvP unless they have a healer. You can't go wrong with the other two, they're great at everything listed.
---
Stupid to play the lottery, by that same logic... and yet, it is a trillion dollar a year industry. Go figure.
---
Opposition to guild banks at least makes sense because it impacts the gameplay.
---
Stuff like having the hairstyles that they added (in wrath?) would change absolutely nothing gameplay-wise.
---
I’m on a F&amp;F list and I didn’t get shit.
---
Also, my plan is to not stick anything on the AH at all till I need to. I'll send all things (ore, BOE's, skinning stuff), all to a bank alt, and then wait to see where I am at 40, and what I need to sell to get the mount. Then I'll hold all stuff again till I get to 60 and need the epic mount. 
---
Hopefully waiting some time, will mean the economy is starting to pick up. 
---
I played about 4hrs a day back in vanilla (maybe longer at the weekends), and it took roughly 6 weeks to get to 60. This time I am aiming for 2 months. So hopefully by then a lot more folk are 60 and when I sell my wares, they are all bought easily :D
---
They should have just kept plains running, why would Tauren need/want a mount?

And as others have said, Wolfshead Helm is indeed BiS for all content. As your gear gets stronger, the energy it gives becomes worth more damage.
---
Don't think about character progression as a math equation and you'll be okay.
---
I agree with you mate. Dwarf player here, give me new dwarves please
---
I started in BC but Lord I don't care for the old models at all. Love the gameplay - however hate the textures
---
They were debating it but didn't come to a conclusion. Also they wanted our opinion.
---
Omg. Fuck those things.
---
Like I said, I will enjoy playing with him whatever he goes for. It is other players I am worried about, and that is why I am asking.
---
It's a fix, you couldn't increase nameplate distance in vanilla even through scripts.
---
You also couldn't accurately track debuffs or casts attached to nameplates in vanilla although there were mods that could more or less make a good estimate based off the combat log.
---
I'm having trouble deciding between Warlock, Shaman and Warrior.
---
I've played all 3, lock and warrior in cata-legion and liked them all the way through. And I rolled a shaman in legion and loved healing in pvp. Never got into the dps aspect but I do like the nice mix of melee and ranged dps you would be able to do in pvp. Since I have never played any of these classes in vanilla I'm just looking for some more info to help me decide. Any feedback on these 3 classes would be appreciated!
---
Why is there always someone's face on the side of the thumbnail? Every single one.
---
You're being downvoted, but you're right. I really wish we had an option for newer models.
---
hawk does more damage, and you dont get dazed if the mob hits up. 
---
Just throw cheetah up as you start running off. It wasnt a big mana cost to switch.
---
i agree, but personally, gbanks is just one of those things that have have so little of an impact on gameplay, while also having a significant QoL affect that it feels like it would be a welcome change. 
---
I cant imagine anyone would complain that classic has gone soft because of gbanks.
---

and that would be classic wow with the inevitable LFR addon.
---
Thanks a lot mate :)
---
&gt;Should I say something or nah?
---
I think sky won't fall if you politely share some information or maybe even your opinion with your brother.
---
I'm personally going to go two gathering professions most likely while leveling and then go engineering at 60. It costs a fuck ton and you don't really make any money on the stuff you can sell
---
If you head there at 10 you'll run out of quests. It's recommended to stay in your respective starting zone until 11 or even 12, depending on your class and its level 10 class quest.
---
My horde guild i am making with some buddies is &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
afaik, they utilize the same API, but some commands won’t be valid for Classic, as it has been stripped out from the features and functionality of retail.
---
The forbidden snack at the keyboard.
---
&gt; but do you really trust the new content from new blizzard?
---
Yes.
---
In fact, I trust Blizzard more than the fans.
---
What Blizzard *should* do if they do new stuff for Classic is just ignore the fans and do what they feel like doing.  Don't do what the fans ask for.
---
Because fans wanted easier ways to get around, easier ways to get into groups, easier ways to raid, harder dungeons, easier dungeons, harder dungeons, more to do at endgame, easier leveling, more catch up mechanics, fewer catch up mechanics, etc., etc., etc.  The game is what it is because fans kept asking for stuff, Blizzard did it, then people realized they didn't want things they asked for.  But since no one can take responsibility for themselves, folks would rather claim Blizzard's "incompetent" than admit that Blizzard kept giving them what they were asking for.
---
Heck, Classic's just another example.  They're giving people exactly what they asked for, and people already want to change it, while others aren't happy with it even happening.  So WoW Classic's very existence in the form people wanted is "Blizzard incompetence."
---
I hear ya. I haven’t played since WotLK and I am REALLY struggling to decide whether to get back into it or not. I’m watching BiS videos and tanking guides on YouTube. I also visit this sub daily (hourly). What WANT to do is drop a couple grand on new chair, desk and computer. I wanna go back through and really take the time to appreciate all the little storylines in the game. But I’ve got a lot more going on now than I did 8 years ago. It’s a struggle
---
I have always liked alchemy since wrath, before that i never really leveled my professions during vanilla. 
---
For classic, im definitely rolling herb/alch. I have always liked alch as a prof since consumables have always been a much easier market to get into, and with everyone starting fresh, there wont be anyone trying to control the market.
---
How did you play on that set up? Sitting on a couch bent down over the coffee table? Even a young me wouldn't be able to handle that pressure?
---
I think what you need to consider before choosing any of these 3 is what role you primarily want to have. All 3 are healers, and all 3 are capable of performing well in raids with their healing talents. 
---
Consider that priests are more of a "pure" healing class, and that 2/3 of their talent trees are focused around healing and preventing damage to your teammates. Shadow is the dps spec, but you won't be topping damage meters or be that desirable endgame so unless you want to pvp for all your gear - get used to doing healing and not much else. You bring some crowd control against undead with shackle, have an AoE fear, and can mind control humanoid mobs. You also have an offensive dispel so that's useful too.
---
Shaman and druid both pay the "hybrid tax," in that they are good at multiple things but excel at none. Well, shamans excel at healing when resto specced, but their ranged dps spec and their melee dps spec aren't the best.  Totems provide good benefits to your group and can be clutch in pvp when used in the right scenarios. There's nothing quite like using a grounding totem right as a warlock is tossing out a death coil, or a mage is polymorphing you. Druids are kinda "meh" at everything, but offer amazing versatility when your group is lacking a specific role. They also have some decent CC in the form of root and hibernate (vs. beasts). 
---
So really, it's on you bro. If you want pure healing, go priest. If you want to mix things up a bit, go with shaman or druid.
---
It can usefull to leave cheetah on to weave in melee autoattacks when you wait for autoshot. It gives you movement enough to get a rotation going eventhough you dont play it to perfection.
---
Is there even anything somewhat decent on the drop table?
---
I'm planing to play a Prot Warrior this time around, but I'm a little worried about my ability to do things on my own as Prot. Are they totally unable to kill stuff on their own, or are they just very slow at it?
---
My friends and me are planning a LAN and we are only allowed to go to sleep if we clear DM
---
That's a good point too! I have always been a poor wow player, never farmed gold. The thought that Hunter has a decent spec for both pve and pvp is a big plus.
---
&lt;Herding Cats&gt;
---
Because we all know that's really what it's like.
---
Spec BM, send your pet kill some mob and go grab a drink, come back to loot corps and repeat, no need of aspect
---
The TRUE classic experience!
---
I don't think anyone will disagree.  If you go:
---
* Dual gathering, you get the most money, but provide absolutely no benefit to yourself or your guild\*
---
* Gathering + Crafting (i.e. a druid going Skinning + LW, a mage going Tailoring + Enchanting\*\*), you can provide benefits to yourself and your guild, but those benefits could also be provided by someone else
---
* Engineering, you get all of the "Requires Engineering" gear, and also can buy the LW or Tailoring gear from the Leatherworkers and Tailors\*\*\*
---
*\*You can get money and mats, but can't make gear.*
---
*\*\*Technically tailoring + enchanting is dual crafting, but since enchanting is its own gathering and everyone can farm cloth, it's like dual gathering + dual crafting, but you miss out on vendoring greens*
---
*\*\*\*Except for the one or two items for your class that are BOP or require a profession*
---
Engineering is expensive, because most of it can only be used by engineers who will make the items themselves.  Also, *someone* has to go LW or Tailoring or Enchanting or there will only be Engineers running around.  But for your own personal use, Engineering is best.
---
Alchemy is one for sure, pots/elixirs make a huge difference in raiding
---
You can turn off error speech
---
Man i wish i could do 24 hours, but i got a baby now and there is no way I could do that to my wife.
---
Yeah I am not going to sleep until I reach 15.
---
Meant that kek is what alliance sees when horde speaks. Unclear writing on my part
---
And what is so bad about paladins? They are not very interesting but I had no issues leveling one, it leveled with decent speed and not once was i in danger, also was able to solo elites. Yes It was slower than my warlock but it was still pretty good.
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
If blizzard makes this, with the design philosophy of classic/tbc and new content, I dont know what I will do with my life.
---
Cool!
---
30-40 is usually what I'd go for, but I try to sleep doing the evening to sleep better, so it depends when the game comes out. I can't recall what hour it will be in EU I think it's like midnight? In that case I might go for 45+ so that it's night when I sleep.
---
Ashenvale is the BEST for this
---
I been playing a bit on pserver to help with the HYPE problems and the road east of aastranar has both wyverns and griffons fly overhead, while pvp scraps are going on. It’s pretty damn fun

---
What would be something you want to make?
---
God I hate the way orc males are all hunched over all the time

Not everyone is a speedrunner. I'm taking my time and enjoying the game. By the time I hit 40 there will be plenty of bored try hards with nothing better to do than buy my savory deviate delights.
---
Uther was an asshole for real though. A fanatically religious person, put him right next to the scarlet crusade. Both factions are fanatically obsessed with religion. Tirion &gt; Uther.
---
For launch take skinning to vendor everything. 
---
As a second you can go with mining or herbs. Don't sell right away! Wait a couple of weeks/days/months to make the best profit to see how the economy is growing.
---
You could also just safe all your herbs/ores in bank, at 60 you discard skinning and take alch, smith etc. to turn your mats into skill ups and make money that way long term selling potions
---
I made my family disappear.
---
Yeah because private servers overtube mobs to make them more difficult.  They are not what it was like in Vanilla.
---
despite taking a week off, i'm still in the 5-10 bracket. my goal is to hit lvl 40 but it will probably be like 30
---
Ide say that's a pretty far stretch. The value of those two is insanely different if you win. It's the same concept for sure though so I guess your right.
---
You can do what you want with your money no matter how stupid it is.

When the level cap went up yesterday they sent out some more invites. My nephew got one... little fuxer.

Thanks for the share, much appreciated!

Kargoz does some decent speed leveling streams. He's also relatively drama free.
---

---
Depends how many mobs you are killing. If I'm killing mobs while moving to a place, I'll keep on cheetah, but if I'm doing a quest to kill 10-15 mobs at some place I keep hawk and attack move towards the next mob so I never really need the speed.
---
You could only kill the eye and not phase 2 though. I'm not even sure if the leser can crit.  
---
I thought it just hit for flat 50 million before the nerf.
---
In 1970 the Kinks said “boys will be girls and girls will be boys.” L-o-l-a
---
I'm going to be honest, I'm going to contribute to this problem. If you want the plate loots, you'd better be willing to get punched in the face because i'm not sharing. (Might just opt to get all leather/mail classes dps because wifey is maining priest)
---
Yeah, that's what I mean, that it's still up in the air and we don't have confirmation
---
48+ hours the first "day". I think I'll go with that.
---
Definitely paladin. Defense, heals, and if all else fails, bubble hearth!
---
So the idea is you skin stuff at early levels and vendor it to have quick cash? Interesting thought actually
---
It really does depend on the server. Each server will evolve it's own economy. Gathering professions, especially mining, herbalism and skinning, are usually pretty good.
---
&gt;Cuties feel way more alive
---
I think there's a necrophilia joke lurking there..
---
There is nothing quite like picking some Icecap in the snow
---
Man - just wait for the fuckin release. Subing only for chance to invite is ridiculous
---
Until you're not - part of the problem you'll find is that a lot of times MT's and the style of play outside the raids leads to them wanting similar commitments from their raiders, and starting to see teh grass on the other side.
---
Not to say you'll get envious of other guilds, but you'll start to see "hey I'm spending all this time on this stuff, to make sure I'm a good MT, I'm here for every single raid, and the rest of these guys just show up, why can't we kill X boss? These guys need to step it up" and it starts to lead to conflict there. Often times THIS is why a MT will leave for a more progressed guild, because the raid mentality and playing philosophy no longer meshes with the guild they came up with. This isn't bad - it's human nature, you want others to put in similar effort to yourself for the same rewards.
---
100% spot on
---
Retail brain. Trash
---
No BC content.
---
If you're willing to tank, warrior.  The hardest parts are leveling them, and dealing with being on the wrong end of a class that scales well with gear.  The easiest parts are taking a geared level 60 warrior with a healer backing you up and wrecking everything.
---
If you're not willing to tank, mage.  You got an insane amount of CC, which is useful in both BGs and group PvE content.  I've seen groups specifically looking for a mage more often than looking for a healer.
---
Screw it then.  I'm going to make my own club with blackjack and hookers.
---
If there wasn't that /s I would hunt you down until I find you. Just to tell you that it's DM and not freakin VC!!!!
---
They're an absolute blast in PvP, both world and BGs. And unless you're in a top 5% guild racing for world firsts, I can see guilds taking more than just one hunter. I wouldn't be worried about that.
---
&gt;You could also just safe all your herbs/ores in bank, at 60 you discard skinning and take alch, smith etc. to turn your mats into skill ups and make money that way long term selling potions
---
Thats if you have room in your bank to store it all. Bags are hard to come by
---
I have a friend there that told me
---
I remember OG well, the Orc Warrior that only spoke in 3rd person.
---
Yeah with my personal life, grinding just can’t be a priority or else I won’t have time for what I want to be doing in the game. 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhecoxZG0Ezrmzbco
---
This is the best spec I could come up with that should make both PvP and pve passable but definitely more pve focused as I ignored the sub tree completely.
---
If it’s an undead mage maybe the mage. But affliction locks are some danger boys.
---
They might be able to use the same fix for both. We'll see.
---
Uncertain as of now. I think once I’m knowledgeable with the utility for development of the add-ons, it’ll spark in the dome!
---
I level it with cooking  to max on every toon. The buffs are nice and for a mana user the sage fish is great.
---
Its like almost any other game that gets released with a press version, they shouldnt let the press show the entire game.
---
Yeah you’ll make a nice chunk of change while only wasting like 4 hours on the way to 60
---
And even then some people just want to play the lottery even if they lose. Its exciting , gives you something to look forward to a few evenings a week. I doubt people get the same little trill when checking there bnet client every morning.
---
But there's a clock in game.. you just got to move your mouse.
---
I love how no changes is so hard to grasp.
---
Staysafe. Alliance Warlock.
---
Yep
---
Yup, and pservers helped a lot of people become familiar with the numbers and help with catching bugs too
---
First character was a Dwarf hunter.  I leveled to 60, and we were doing MC.   Problem was that the Hunter that was from the previous EQ guild kept getting all the loot.   He had 5 pieces of t1, before I had one.  I was always on the top of the dmg meter too.   Looking back, it was probably a DKP thing, but even still it seems fishy.   Regardless, I left and joined the horde on another server after that. 
---
I played a shaman through the rest of Vanilla.   Made it largely through Naxx, but never finished.  I liked playing elem as a shaman in pvp, and I liked playing a shaman in general.   In Razorgore, we had a cool strat where the shamans would kite the majority of the mobs around while everyone else killed the boss.  
---
I have several concerns.
---
1.  Gold farming. (Mage) I played a TON in Vanilla, so I had money, despite being a healer.   I made a lot of it largely by selling potions and flask.   I used my alchemy to make some money.  Even still, I had to buy 1000 gold from gold sellers at one point.    I know that I can farm up bijous with a mage, and make tons of money.   They're the best at making money, but their rotation in pvp is literally just frostbolt in MC.   Later they go fire, which involves rolling ignites somehow.   There is a strategy there, so that wouldn't be quite as boring.
---
2. Leveling. (hunter) I hate leveling in Vanilla.   It takes FOREVER.   This is why I kind of wanted to play a hunter, because they're the best at leveling.   But their dps isn't the best, and it will be much harder to find a group as a dps.
---
3. Dungeons: (Warrior)  The next issue I have is dungeon farming.  Trying to find a group back when I played a hunter was tough.   I spent countless hours in org just spamming chat for dungeons.   I filled my friends list with tanks and healers, and pestered them nonstop.   Warriors can get a group any time they want though, so that would solve this issue largely.   I played warrior in TBC, and I was quite good at tanking.   Another problem with this though is that everyone and their brother will be playing Warrior, because they're OP and can make a group anytime they want.  
---
4. Loot Whoring: (??)  I am a loot whore.   I love big loots, and I don't know why.  So, I don't want to play a class that is extremely overpopulated.
---
5. Disabled ( Pries/Paladin):   I have nerve damage,and it causes discomfort and stiffness in my hands.   I can't play at the same level as I used to because of this.  Using a mouse to cast heals shouldn't be too much of a problem though.   Hitting 20+ keybinds on my keyboard is probably out though, so I need a class that is fairly easy to be competitive with without needing said keybinds.  Healing seems like it would be the easiest in PVE, while still being interactive and fun.
---
Pre kidney shot you literally can only backstab after gouge as rogues have no other way to get behind. I do agree combat is a bit of boring leveling playstyles but until about level 30 you don't have many options.
---
Binds aren't UI
---
&gt;/u/Malfhots Not Really true. Certainly true for some races like nelf, tauren and such but c'mon. The new dwarf and orc models are fucking amazing and stayed 100% true to og models

“What do we do now?” “Now we play the game”
---
Not yet, but on August 12/13 you will be able to pre-select a realm and you will be able to make up to 3 characters
---
So what do you suggest? Trying to start my own guild so that I can MT? Surely funnelling gear towards myself may seem a bit bias + I have no experience running a guild! Or is it too much of a pipe dream to be a MT so I should cut my losses and play as a hunter?
---
15g is what I see the xmute go for laterish, 30g-45g xmute early on I bet.
---
I can't speak to it being "the best" but I can tell you it's absolutely unnecessary.  Guilds (albeit not THAT many) cleared everything years ago in Vanilla.  Now all of these private server players/followers are claiming that raids are actually easy mode now that people have been able to practice for a decade, and will be even easier in Classic (relatively to their private servers).  Despite them being "easy" there are hardcore guilds insisting that every last raid member be an engineer, among other min/maxing.  Give me a break.  Unless you plan on being a bleeding edge raider in the absolutely most bleeding edge guild, every single race, class, and profession is perfectly viable (alas, probably not the case for some specs).
---
Be an engineer if it appeals to you.  Don't be one if you'd rather be something else.
---
Without a free gold injection? Thats nice dude.
---
u know what I mean ;)
---
“Oh. This joke. Again. For the 500th time today. Am I still supposed to be nice to them?”

Pre level 10 "party" is the key word. I know I will toss those invites left right and center.
---
You didn't get "deep dicked." You unsubbed. This is the epitome of bitching/whining and entitlement on /r/classicWoW.
---
Why don’t you just not watch the streams?
---
For leveling or at 60?
---
Terrible, terrible idea to level as Prot. There's no reason to; keep a shield in your backpack and you can tank 5-mans as any spec.

At 60 you'll be slower at grinding mobs for rep/farm but it's not that bad.
---
is that bfa?lol
---
lol, he claims he is a speed leveler but at the end of the day he's pretty average mate.
---
Im rolling druid tank aswell (as alt though) but the choice was easy for me cuz NE get the 1% extra dodge.
---
Warstomp isnt bad its just more for pvp imo.
---
Lol you guys need to stop being so extreme about everything. A person can’t have their own opinion about what they like or don’t like in certain aspects of the game. I like the game the way it is and I’m excited to play it. But to be downvoted for certain people who don’t have time to wait an hour just to play the game is ridiculous. If I had to wait an hour to start up my PlayStation sometimes then I would never buy it. If the servers are full so Sony decides to put me on a secondary server then sure I’d accept that as long as I can play the damn game I paid for. If you’d rather have a queue to wait to get on the same shard as everyone else then that should be your choice and I have no issue with that but people in this subreddit are just too extreme when it comes to the opinion of others when they differ from themselves.
---
Hunter is the most noob-friendly class in the game. They'll be fine with hunter. But yeah, someone needs to roll a tank lol.
---
It isn't called out under Night elf rogue benefits so i was wondering. Was there a way for other rogue races to eat without leaving stealth?
---
This is a very overlooked (albeit races) little section of information that I would recommend anyone looking to be serious about playing a rogue to know. Great post.
---
Come be my tauren druid buddy. We can run circles around nerds in WSG while shapeshifting and flag carrying, then moon fire spam as we 360 off the alliance graveyard and back into cheetah form to win the game.
---
You know. Arthus wasn't wrong for the culling of Strathholme. If uther had stood by his shell-shocked junior arthus might have been spared his destiny.
---
Seems about right, early on Arcanite Xmute is VERY valuable since so few people will have it and the arc bars will be very sought after for all the craftables.
---
Yes because that way, you loot more out of every beast. 
---
Since it's a fresh server, and almost everybody knows now that you need a lot of gold for your moun(s), nobody (not many) people will actually buy anything in the AH because nobody has the extra money to spend.
---
/salute
---
48 hours in 1 day? Not sure how that works.
---
Yeah I would go with DPS gear, dual wield and shield slam macro when it's up.
---
I think it would give the best result.
---
Or I would go fishing \^\^
---
Yes however you couldn't have characters of both factions. Atleast not on PvP servers, it might have been the case on PvE?
---
Add cooking in there too =P
---
This is definitely an important point. All of these small things add up and create the true wonderful WoW experience.  
---
I remember the first time I got to a FP and I managed to get enough silver for a few rides. I had to destination, I was just so amazed and wanted to fly more. And while traveling has its length, that feeling never really went away until MUCH later when the overall traveling in the game changed. But I still some times fly through azeroth just for fun, under the trees and diving close to the ground, and I am still as amazed as before. It's just that there's a HUGE difference in flying over everything in a straight line, than having to sit back and experience how rich and immense the world really is.
---
I meant the weapon imbuement proc.
---
You are practically touching the ground at some point. Its so cool.
---
All Rogues can start eating and then enter Stealth
---
At what point do you start selling skins in the AH?
---
Is this a video of the dude from dethklok?
---
To be honest I dont, but Im a bit of a tard.
---
I'll do a 24 hours marathon, followed by a short sleep break and straight back into another 24 hour marathon
---
Not unless you had 2 accounts, once you made a Horde/Ally etc char you got faction locked.
---
You.. put it perfectly.
---
Yep, skinning isn't much but it adds up and helps offset the basic unavoidable costs like repair bills, flight paths, and skill training. 
---
Though if you're a true Vanilla Big Brain 5-head ™ you'll figure out which skills you can *not* train on the way to 60 to save a ton of money.
---
You guys have been incredibly helpful, thank you everyone for helping me pick a class! I genuinely feel grateful for all of you taking some time off your day to help me out.   
---
I still have 80 something days to think about it, but at least now I know it's between Troll Shaman or Tauren Druid.
---
Going to call it Moonbrook to piss people off even more lol
---
I flag carried for Schizm as a mage. It was fun since our group typically got stomped by the high warlord groups our strategy usually was to turtle and force them to afk since our que times were 45+ min. It made more sense for us to drag games out and farm honor. In AB we probably only beat the best horde groups 1/3 of the time. We had a few weak players on our squad including a hand of rag ret lol.
---
I plan on playing a preist this go around.
---
&gt; I don't care too much about streamers and don't watch them myself. I just think that we'd get more players and incentivize Blizzard to put more effort into Classic, not like they're not dedicated from what we've seen. I just really want Classic to be the most successful game.
---
But how can his ghost show up if his soul is inside Frostmourn?
---
This is how you get your mount at level 50 instead of 40
---
I read that in American; it didn’t rhyme. UK?
---
Going Paladin for healing and want to focus on both PVE and PVP. From what I've read, Human and Dwarf are pretty competitive and one isn't necessarily better than the other. Both Stoneform and Perception seem really good for combating Rogues in PVP, but the Human's rep bonus and weapon specializations may pull them ahead.  
---
I'd love some more insight into the strengths of both races for the class.
---
If that was the case, why were pve realms called "normal" realms?
---
Hey I had the same question. Thanks for asking this dude!
---
&gt;how do i kill it
---
You stick 'em with the pointy end !
---
I'm sure as I play this there will be several QoL changes I'd wish were in the game that have been added to retail. But going into Classic, the one that I keep thinking about is Dual Specs. Esp since I like playing tanks/healing classes more so than DPS. Having an off PVP or DPS/Farming spec beats the hell out of dropping a ton of gold (which is hard to come by in vanilla) to respec all of the damn. I'm also older now and don't have 8+ hours a day to play lol.
---
A little off topic but kinda similiar, a tip for all tailorers: Once the early craze of Mooncloth (Mainly for Truefaith Vestments) is over, save up all your Mooncloth until ZG launches in P3. Mooncloth is required for the Bloodvine set which is a fantastic craftable set where some pieces will be BiS up to AQ.
---
I'm planning on rolling a druid or warrior.
---
I'm going to tank 5 man's and get all my friends geared, in fact I will have a reliable priest pocket healer throughout. 
---
I love tanking and I love healing, DPS is boring. 
---
The reason I'm leaning druid is because of time. 
---
I don't want to spend obscene amounts of hours farming for tank consumables AND DPS consumables for threat gen as a prot warrior. If you can fix this in my head please do. 
---
With a druid my plan would be to tank all the way up to our pre raid BiS then go healer. 
---
I also really enjoy the 0/30/21 spec(it's a tank and heal spec) as a druid I'm using it on a private server right now and so far I've both healed and tanked ONY. 
---
I also am nervous about missing 5% of our raids and how that would effect my guild if I'm high up the tank charts. 
---
Can anyone change my mind to warrior or poke a hole in my plan?

Funny how I still dont get a meme that's complete taking over reddit.
---
My best friend and I are running a Warrior + Priest combo on a P server right now.  We did both Uldaman and Zul'Farrak with a feral druid that was absolutely amazing.  
---
Warrior got stunned and he popped bear form and picked up the aggro.  I got hexxed and he would take over healing.  I went OOM and he would innervate me, pop off a few HOTs, and go back to DPSing.  Dude was a hell of a player, and was doing things a mage could not do.
---
A well-played druid is an amazing sight to behold.  And is going to be a lot rarer than a well-played mage.
---
Either way, you're stuck decursing!
---
He said he doesnt have time. Farming soul shards takes lots and lots of time
---
Play at night or when shes sleeping? Thats what I will have to do now that I have a kiddo :) Casual but its better than nothing
---
You give it life...
---
Some good necklace for your level iirc, mostly because you don't get a necklace that easily while leveling.
---
I prefer the increase in detail with the newer models. Granted with that increase in detail some of the models dont look as "nice" as the older ones due to certain facial expressions or the texture on the face in general. But overall the smoother animations and higher quality models appeals to me more and would be a welcome CHOICE (choice being the key word here) to wow classic.
---
@ 60. No way in hell I'm leveling as Prot.
---
Thanks for the reply, made me less worried!
---
keep in mind that not everybody plays wow for the raids!
---
I have a couple of friends who played wow for several years without ever being in a raiding guild.
---
If your brother enjoys it, he will have fun and for dungeons Enh should be more than fine.
---
You could push him in a direction that you want to do a dungeon and need that healer pretty bad and he should try it out once, maybe he enjoys it and after that you are golden, having an shamy healer for raiding if that's his interest ;)
---
Oh wow this is awesome - thanks
---
I have a very limited vanilla experience confined to my holy paladin. All I can tell you is what I heard in raids. At the time I had no idea what it meant as I was spamming my downranked heals. You absolutely may be correct, I just remember our GM who was also the MT saying he can spec out of full prot after getting some piece of loot.
---
But the AH cut was way bigger than your own faction AH.
---
Maybe the viewer counts will go down once Classic releases, mainly due to people being busy playing themselves.
---
However I seriously doubt this will have any impact on whether people will be playing Classic or not.
---
Ulduars design remains the best in the games entire lifespan but the next best thing is no raid difficulties and standard progresssion with no catchup vendors. Agree brother.
---
Dungeon content in vanilla isn't hard. It isn't. Most people who min-max it do so to either make it less tedious or they're bad and want to be carried. If your brother wants to play an enhancement shaman, he can do most of the dungeon content in the game. As long as you're playing a tank or healer you should be able to automatically get him a group just fine and it shouldn't be a problem.
---
The difficulty comes in raid content. Classes that use both melee and magic suck because hit% is specific to melee or magic only, meaning an Enhancement Shaman is almost certainly not going to be hit capped. Same issue with the scaling of their abilities - spells scale with spell power and their white hits and Stormstrikes scale with strength. Additionally, Shaman characters will use up slots on the debuff limit that don't help that much. There's a reason that Frost Bolts and Shadow Bolts were the bread-and-butter - with the debuff limit in place, you only wanted to use spells that did damage without leaving a debuff on the target that might knock off something important like Sunder. Enhancement Shaman just aren't going to be good in raids in vanilla, that's a fact.
---
As far as PvP, Enhancement Shaman are actually a solid PvP class. Are they the best? No. They bring strong anti-caster utility though and given that a lot of people will be playing Mages and Locks, that's pretty nice to have in a group. Windfury totem is also fantastic support for teammate Warrior, allowing them to explode in damage on a target. They're a physical-based damage dealer in part though, so they are gear dependent. 
---
TL;DR - if he's just playing for fun and dabbling in dungeon content in end-game, playing shaman is fine. If you're going to try to get him to go full sweaty red-hat nerd try-hard status, then Enhancement Shaman might not be the best choice for PvE.
---
Sorry you aren’t allowed. I’m the only lock main on my server. Already called it bro
---
You listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFnCzUxLU8).
---
I'll definitely be casual but I need to get through the "buying a computer" phase before I can worry about having time to play.
---
The couch still smells to this very day
---
Yes but the listing price is high and I think there’s another cut not sure
---
The quest is decent though :)
---
While leveling, I find hunter better than warlock for a few reasons:
---
1. Hunter pets hold better aggro and hunters are better healers
---
2. Most dungeon groups already have a Priest and a Mage, and don't want a Warlock to compete on cloth rolls
---
I am beginning to realize having my interrupt on R isn't good because if I'm strafing right I can't hit the damn key
---
Since it's opening up at midnight CEST on the 27th, here on the US east coat it will open up at 6pm on the 26th. I'll be using the rest of that day to play. Technically I guess I can only get in 6 hours that first day.
---
I’m trying to understand.  You think that there will be a large amount of people who view streamers progress and subsequently opt out of playing the game entirely because they watched a streamer complete content?  I find it hard to believe that someone who would diligently watch streamers in a beta, would then opt out of buying that very game upon release.
---
Does this help you (zips are located at the bottom of the two links)?

The old *textures* are nicer. The new models are for the most part, better-looking. The problem with the new models is the textures not being 1:1.
---
Warlock SM/Ruin is the only spec I know of that can actually be fully optimal for both PvP and PvE. Everyone else has to make some sacrifices if they want a multipurpose spec. 
---
Shamans actually have one of the best, ele/resto. Druid HotW is up there. DPS can at least farm with their raid specs which is a bonus, even if most of them suck for PvP.
---
Does anyone else alway bind abilities to the types of things abilities do? Any time I play a class with a silence, it ALWAYS gets bound to Mouse 5. Defensive CDs are always bound to Alt-Q and Alt-E. Self heals, R.
---
nah, just not shit
---
I don’t have the beta so no one gets to see streams of beta

NE shadow meld was on a separate cooldown from stealth. You could go from stealth to eating to shadow meld without becoming visible to other players. You could also go into stealth from inside shadow meld so you can then start moving around again when you were done. It was more useful in TBC Arena, but its still a nice perk in world pvp and BGs.
---
Raid difficulties are so immersion-breaking and demotivating...

I understand that in fast moving environment like a cash register or retail shop these are inappropriate but with tickets it shouldn't be that bad. Plus I often see funny screen caps of support cracking jokes. Also nice projection.
---
As far as Pandaria goes, it’s not just narrative. The delivery of quests were much more goofy, and felt like pre-movie shorts in a children’s movie. The jade princess, the monkey hozen quests, the monkey undead love triangle, the meditation where the panda throws kegs at you... I don’t *hate fun*. But Pandaria was loaded with a bunch of quests that felt cheesy and goofy, yet clunky and they were around every corner. 
---
Although to be fair, that started with Cata. That Uldum Harrison Jones questline is one of the most consistently obnoxious “jokes” Blizzard has told in their game. 
---
Also, I fail to understand the point you’re introducing with the Pixar vs Disney thing. It’s not that either Disney or Pixar are bad on their own... they both make some great stuff and some stuff I don’t care for. That doesn’t mean anybody wants mainstream cartoon studio type stylistics in their RPG. It’s not Disney vs Pixar, it’s keep both Disney and Pixar away from this game. Again, not that the original game wasn’t cartoony, it was. Just a very different style of cartoony that fit the gritty nature of the game better. So I really fail to see what you mean by that?
---
Yep, here's the filter: https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=57;1;0

A full list of all the filters can be found in: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292058/classic-item-stat-filters-added-to-wowheads-database
---
60 or final stage testing should be limited to a very few experienced people. Like 1-2 raids max. And shouldn't be streamed. No need to ruin the hype for raids months before the game comes out.
---
I still have omen installed on live (on my warlock) and i really have no idea why.

Her subtle way of reminding you NOT to play classic so you can have her candy shop. The second you login to classic that shit is closed for business....... forever.
---
Legendary items were great for preventing the need of catchup venders. It's something that should have been in very expansion. If you wanted one you had to go into it. Plenty of people wouldn't want one so they would skip to allow less geared guild mates to easily fill the spot.
---
And he would walk everywhere. Never ran. 
---
Before BC he made his own guild &lt;Og Love All&gt;.
---
Holy fuck this sub throws downvotes as soon as someone EVEN thinks about starting dialogue. Everyone has a different opinion about what classic should be like, and this opinion isn't even extreme at all and is actually quite valid.
---
&lt;Autismus Maximus&gt;
---
it is though.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Not playing a Druid but nice try. Have you been up all night refreshing hoping I reply? You were awfully fast on your reply. Min maxing that too?
---
nonsense. Its a 15yo game, everyone can look up everything thats in there.
---
If there's already a clock in game why does it matter if you just add visibility to it? The no changes crowd are so fucking single minded, it's ridiculous, it's a fucking clock dude.
---
Instead not only does Uther abandon him but Jaina as well. I always wished we would see either him redeemed or to either see a version of him that did not take up Frostmourn either from the Caverns of Time or in WoD when the Iron Horde popped up why couldn't we have gotten help from an Azeroth that was never invaded lead by Arthas? Or fuck something, Wrath was as disapointing as TBC since Blizzard has a fetish with killing off old lore people. Kael'thas, Illidan, Arthas.
---
I don't remember how much but i remember seeing it and deciding to never use they neutral AH because of how big the cut was. Greedy ass goblins.
---
Yea dungeons were super hard back then, classic yeaaaaa!
---
I also saved Mooncloth for Naxx, but apparently the whole server did the same and the price has only been falling :D But Fadeleaf, umm...
---
man let the dude post his story, maybe hes hoping the dude sees it and hits him back for classic
---
The feels..
---
Nah, I just don't want the hype to die down.  It has nothing with being able to watch it.  I also didn't say to not stream this next upcoming level 40 beta.  I just said for level 50 and 60 because that content is more interesting and watching it might kill hype for when the game launches.
---
There are a ton of people watching only because it's popular on twitch.  Blizzard can capture those people when the game launches, but they can't capture them in 3 months when Classic isn't flavor of the month anymore.
---
I don’t think the meta was full prot but like 8-40-12 something like that
---
And if there's already one there why argue to change it?
---
My favorite Quote from Uther:
---
The urn holds your fathers ashes Arthas! What, were you hoping to piss on them one last time before yoy left his kingdom to rot!?
---
The amount of people watching classic beta twitch streams compared to the general population of players is minimal.  I just don’t think it’s going to matter at all. If you’re dumb enough to get burnt out on WoW classic before it’s even out then that’s your problem.  Let people stream what they want to stream, it’s quite literally putting food on the table for some people.
---
I hope you all subbed and didn’t get in!!!
---
Running SMGY right now, without a shield tanking it fine as a level 33 pally.
---
There’s no way you can say old Jabba the hut looks better. They used practical effects in the old movie, you could tell it was fake. But the new CGI version really makes it look real, and captures his look better. Old Jabba in a suit was hard to look at. 
---
See what I mean?
---
I mean, if you already are going to get Classic, enjoy classic for (whatever timeframe they stretch the content to... probably 2 years) and then let people who enjoy TBC have TBC? No? Only you must get what you want? Okay, nvm :)
---
I didn’t mind heroics where you got different but better loot. But I despise mythical where you can get 25 slightly different versions of the same item therefore never best in slot.
---
Was it considered a bad investment to make the q6 slot bags? I remember paying high dollar for a few of then
---
"All night"?   
---
You realize there is more than one timezone? I guess you do not
---
No one with a somewhat decent streaming setup, will not stream classic on release.  Everybody and their mother will do it
---
But gotta love a holy paladin best heals back then they could full heal from a low rank spell crit make everyone else look bad
---
Oh cool! I didn't hear about that. Do you have a link to read more about it?

It gives OK xp the first time, right? Or was that only the grime encrusted ring?

I was actually just thinking about this one a couple nights ago.
---
How exactly would a naga steal a bike?  Like...would they ride 'side saddle' and use their tails to push themselves along?  Would they have to just pick up the bike and carry it off?  If so, why would they even want your bike?
---
I guess they could use magic to make it move, but i'd like to think theres a way to make it work without magic.
---

---
Hunter scales the worst of all the real dps classes. So it depends what's satisfying to you. Are you trying to be a meter topping behemoth, or are you happy playing a utility dps roll?
---
Hunter dps is good in MC and BWL and only really falls off in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Pretty happy I got to make a char in beta and level it to 3 before Blizz figured it out and shut the servers down. Now I dont have the beta/stress test option anymore.
---
I frowned heavily after clicking this image. Fuck Gnomer.
---
Back in the day, I used to put my 3 year old on the mic to talk for me in Vent.  There's nothing more fun than parsing top 3 dps in a 40-man raid while people are questioning their decisions in life when a 3 year old is seeming destroying them.
---
On PVP servers you were unable to create character on opposite faction. It was possible on PvE servers.
---
There was a neutral AH bit the cut was like 15 or 25%.
---
Are people really saying that?
---
It has also been confirmed that Nostalrious mob spawns and timers helped blizzard recreate their own.
---
Blizzard back in the day said "they lost the code to classic" but what they actually meant is they lost the data sets of timers, mob spawn locations, etc.  PServer helped them recreate that... And then they were able to come up with an even better solution which classic will utilize.  But if not for PServer data they may not have made that leap into recreating the whole world.
---
Is this for everyone. Heard from streamers it's just for beta testers, wouldn't be to surprised if that's wrong info though.
---
Google, research for yourself
---
Hype will die down on its own, so yea, I'm all for keeping the hype but that's mostly what it is at this point, hype and Nostalgia for some people
---
This is amazing
---
tbh 5-10 is a huge spread.
---
5 is probably on the upper end for me (maybe 6?).  Im waiting until later in the week to truly no life it.
---
Jokes on you, rolled pve. Have fun sitting there, waiting on the flight master to respawn for "content".
---
I don't see why streaming would mean less people would come back play.  Streaming games in general has not led to a reduction in gamer population or reduction in sales across all games.  Well, unless the game was really bad that is, but that isn't the case here.
---
Plus, classic is 15 year old content.  Regardless of live streams, these are experiences that a lot number of players has always experienced.  Not to mention, you can watch full runs of any dungeon from the beginning of wow on youtube.
---
If you were exciting for classic and planning on coming back, the streams will have no affect.  Its the "on the fence" people that might not want to come back due to streams.  But on the fence can be deemed as 50/50 one way or another.  Those 50/50 folk are either getting hyped or being deterred by the slow gameplay.  But, they are still 50/50 whether they watched the streams or not.
---
I just don't see how this make any lick of difference in the long time.  Classic will be popular no matter what.  We already know this.  What player population looks like after the initial sub - well, that's a different story.  And streaming has no affect on that.
---
Asmongold wouldn't get those numbers if everyone was *able* to play the game. Your idea that that type of exposure should be saved for launch is flawed by the fact that at least half of those people wont be watching because they could be *doing it themselves*.
---
I literally don't watch streams, I'm just saying it's going to kill the hype for launch for some people.  That's literally a given and everyone agreed in the podcast which had Shroud, Asmongold, Preach, Esfand, and Swifty.  I don't watch twitch, but I know those are the major content creators for WoW and twitch in general.
---
I'd think any guild that isn't top 1% hardcore will take extra hunters just because the supply will be high (and you can pick and choose a skilled player), and won't compete for 100% of the same gear as Rogues/Warriors or Warlocks/Mages. 
---
Another Fury Warrior might technically be better if all you care about is downing Kel'Thuzad ASAP, but that's yet more loot competition for them and everyone else.
---
Omar Gonzalez looked so handsome!  My gosh he even has 60 frames per second!
---
I think we can all agree that this isn't a beta so much as it is a marketing stunt. Sure, people in the beta can report on bugs and such but, for the most part, this is basically early access with the promise that progression won't carry over to live.  
---
That being said *if this was truly a beta test* and not a marketing campaign, then I would say that yes, they should allow people to beta test all the content for potential bugs. Have those people sign some sort of NDA that prevents them from streaming, give them premade lv60 toons with some raid gear, and let them try to break the game before it launches. No fear of potential secret bosses being leaked or raid clearing strategies solved before launch because everyone already knows!  
---
Who knows, maybe there is some game breaking bug where Nef can one-shot the raid because some dev forgot to add a colon to some random syntax. We won't know because the beta testers aren't allowed to... you know... test the beta?  
---
TL:DR, if this is truly a beta, they should be allowed to test everything, if it's a marketing strategy, then I agree with limiting what is shown.
---
IDK but I plan to stockpile crystals while they are cheaper.
---
Oh my mistake for not knowing which timezone you live in. Doesn't change the fact that you sat there for 9 hours hitting F5 just to min max saying something dumb.
---
People can see 100% of that content for free on any private servers, videos or streams from those servers, and recordings from Vanilla. I don't see people getting "burnt out" on content that everyone either can see easily, or already saw. I'd rather watch someone play it than not see it at all during beta, myself.
---
There are no spoilers, no surprises. The plot was established 15 years ago, the gameplay finalized over a decade earlier than its "reveal" in the streams.
---
so basically you're saying that you're mad because you Raid every night and still have to see guildless scrubs walking around in lvl 70 epics?
---
after watching /u/ianexplosion level to 60 playing mostly that, I can't listen to it anymore ;)
---
The raids were a lot harder in TBC and even with geared raiders guilds were still having a hard time clearing bosses because raids were just way more difficult.
---
In my opinion, badge gear was a great way to help gear alts as well and give people a greater incentive to play the game more.
---
The hardest decision for me was rank 4 or rank 5 heal. I didn't have enough gear to sustain a flash heal spam.
---

tipsoutbaby is the biggest scammer in wow right now.
---
That's really funny actually😁
---
Been considering Warlock lately. SM/Ruin is one common raid spec. But in order to have imp blood pact for raiding don’t warlocks need some points in demo?? If so what’s the common raid spec? 
---
Phase 1/2 won’t have BGs, in your opinion what’s the best PvP spec for world battles? SL with NF 20/31/0? 9/31/11 SL with shadow burn? Or SM/Ruin but then be really squishy?

I left my pc running the night before with a 14 hour delayed mouseclick using autohotkey to click the login button a few hours before i got home

Reason why you don't
---
Whatever people decide they need more of at launch, if we all knew what was going to be super profitable everyone would take that profession and it would not be as profitable.
---
I mean, just pick what's going to help you first and foremost, gold will come but you won't be getting a lot of gold when there literally isn't much in circulation
---
Yes. No matter the class C and shift+C are always my personal cool downs like self heals, bobble etc. F is always cleanse. F1-F4 are always cool downs. Shift+3 is always interrupt. Shift+q is always speed increase. Shift+e is always a stun. Q and E are always my basic attacks. I'd the class doesn't have the type of ability I bind there normally I use it for whatever, but I retail pretty much all the classes have the same type of abilities, as do classes in other games so it works out. Very good for quick reactions
---
I only played in Wrath and was young at the time, I healed in Naxx and Ulduar but was kind of just along for the ride. I was capable at healing but didn't know a lot of the mechanics. When you are talking about Ulduar's design do you mean the ability to do certain things during some of the fights to activate "Hard mode?" I vaguely remember that on a couple of fights.
---
As an adult that works 12 hour shifts, has a 3 year old toddler and coaches community teams I don't I'm "lazy" for wanting to commit what little time I have left to raiding as competitively as I can and ACTUALLY SEE gear come from that time raiding at a reasonable rate.
---
No, I'm lazy for showing up to every raid for a month straight and only getting one epic neckpiece.
---
This guy makes cancer look like Christmas in July.
---
Yes. I know people say this isn’t efficient, but I enjoy doing this and feel a little pride with each crafted piece. I’ll even plan the alts so I can swap gear and potions and things between them. 
---
It doesn’t make for fast and efficient leveling, but I enjoy every hand-crafted piece.
---
"Default UI" means "without using an add-on". The bug reporter tool is also part of the "default UI".
---
Do whatever you'd like.  It's definitely not optimal, but you don't have to be optimal 100% of the time.  
---
I think I decided on leveling leatherworking with skinning.  I always do skinning, but usually couple it with mining.
---
If a rogue gets it before the MT half the guild will gquit.  
---
I would.  
---
If you are the ML but not the GM, get ready for a gkick.  
---
Now you have 1 binding and no guild GG.
---
Is that a level 70 build? Seems to have too many points.
---
Enjoyment first, meta second.
---
on flight paths, if I leave the durotar starting area to travel to the mulgore starting area, which flight paths do I need to pickup so I can travel back to orgrimmar or razorhill when I am done in mulgore and TB?
---
1 6 1 3, its literally the only horde to alliance word i know lmao
---
I don't really care about topping meters, but I do care that getting upgrades actually feels satisfying. If my DPS changes only barely even with a major upgrade, I don't know if I would find the endgame experience enjoyable even if I bring some helpful raid utility. I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense to others, but it makes sense it my head haha.
---
I'll be playing this game mostly solo probably, mostly due to time constraints.
---
I'm waffling between Rogue or Hunter. Thoughts?
---
That is the irony with these hardk0re geeks who sit in their stained underwear and call others "lazy".
---
Just skimming it seems like your main point is it was easier to gear up in TBC because there were more bosses.... But you still had to down those bosses. Also you make the claim that a majority of people didn't see much of BT, which is true. But a majority of people didn't see Hyjal either. Hell, until the Sunwell patch and heavy nerfs a majority of people didn't see more than one or two bosses in TK and SSC. Your total item thing only works for guilds that were full clearing T4-T6 content every week. That was very, very few guilds. 
---
Your point seems to be that because blizzard provided more content in the form of more bosses it made loot so much easier to get. But more loot is a consequence of more bosses. I'm sure you could ask most people and they'd be in favor of more content rather than less content... And it's pretty widely believed that the raid content in TBC was fantastic. 
---
Also, this is a classic sub and there has been no announcement on any kind of TBC server, so who fucking cares whether you thought TBC was bad or not?
---
At least with tbc dungeons you could choose to enter them without having an ilvl requirement.
---
In Bfa I found that by the time you can access heroics they're already worthless
---
Defcamp and melderon right?
---
This game has been around for 15 years. No one is going to be surprised by Molten Core. There's nothing you can do that would kill the hype for a game that's old enough to drive a car.
---
Atleast I farmed some transmog gear on  retail
---
Honestly 15 year olds nowadays don’t know a world without an iPhone in it. I have a teenage brother and his idea of gaming conceptualised in the app-store - he plays a game for that instant-gratification and the second the game slumps he moves on to the next. In an hour i’ll see him play 3-4 games easily. I tried to set him up with WoW Vanilla and he got bored at lvl 3.
---
Classic WoW will not really be a thing for the younger crowds. Its tedious to them. My brother is fair from a unique circumstance, i’d guess he’s closer to the majority of teenagers in playstyle.
---
The min-maxing crowd is going to be mostly 20+ and having came from the original WoW i’d guess.
---
Depending on the content phase, they are more or less 'desirable'.  For example, who cares about the Arcanite Reaper once AV comes out and you can get Ice Barbed Spear which is extremely comparable? Not really worth dropping a couple hundred gold on the AR.  But in phase 1?!  Helloooooo AR!
---
I am a bit torn, originally in Vanilla and all the way up to WoTLK I played a Warlock and I liked it, but then I quit and I played some SWTOR where I played Imperial Agent(stealth, heals, dot dps) and loved it very much, so when I came back in Legion I rolled a druid and had a great time. I am thinking about rolling a feral druid for Classic when I start playing but I have my fears:
---
I don't mind healing in PvE content(in fact I might even prefer it), but I mainly play PvP, just grinding BG's (back in the olden days I would just play AB all day long), and I am a bit scared that by going druid I will just be sitting there and healing all the time and will not be able to fight anyone except for dot dot run run heal dot dot run. I don't mind bleeding and form switching and I understand that I will never be able to compete with rogues on burst, but if going cat form is just so terrible I reckon I might as well just play a rogue, or even go back to warlock.
---
Any suggestions?
---
I enjoyed TBC more than vanilla. The badge gear wasn't that powerful, and it incentivised HCs and kept the dungeons relevant for the entire expansion.
---
17/3/31 specced, with 1h and shield.
---
It's about 70-80% in effectiveness compared to a Mage AoE farming. As a Prot Warr specced for Impale and Shield Slam, you have almost NO DOWNTIME when farming. You would probably eat once every 10 minutes, if that.
---
You are a farming machine that doesn't give a fuck about mobs. You aren't drinking every single pull, like a Mage, you don't care if you miss a slow or freeze or whatever and suddenly there are 4-5 mobs on you, and you have to run, and kite, and all the other shit. You just don't care : those 4-5 mobs CANNOT kill you.
---
And you are more effective than Arms or Fury Warriors. Yes, they kill stuff faster, but they have much more downtime.
---
Now, the problem is WPvP, if you are on a PvP server. As a Prot Warriors, you have like zero chances to win a 1vs1 or escape.
---
But, except that, you will make plenty of gold, without the need of respeccing. Just make sure that only the talents are 17/3/31...the gear should be as much Crit and Agi as possible.
---
Un’goro always had a FP, I played there during tbc
---
If you go rogue you can cash in on opening lockboxes!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I had a text file a long time ago with translations I made... only one I remember was “P Mo fe” = “U Lo se”.
---
I used a friends account to meet up with a horde character in Booty Bay to test out different letters, but its been 9+ years and lost the text file.
---
I’d like to do 100 first week and then next two weeks 40-50
---
It will be easier to gear up. That doesn’t mean it rewards laziness though. There will be guilds that do BT over and over and *over* again and never get somebody their set of glaives. There are a lot of desirable pieces in every raid that you will run time and time again to get. It might not take a whole year for some, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. 
---
BC brought many changes to the game, and this is one of them. Some like it, some don’t. Personally i don’t care much and look forward to BC for other reasons.
---
Also, I’d as far as badge gear goes, I don’t like that it can purchase high quality gear later on, but it’s perfect in its earlier stages. Doing a 5 man Heroic is arguably harder than finding a spot in an MC or ZG pug. The content in 5-Heroics are tough, and and every badge you earn is deserved.
---
Warlock sacks pet, has no pushback now. If a fear gets off on the hunter its gg. So literally one grenade throw -&gt; fear and there's nothing the hunter can do. Warlock can fel dom resummon pet with no pushback. Meanwhile dots are destroying the hunter.
---
Stick 'em with the pointy end!
---
It's best to usually keep aspect of hawk up while weaving movement into your shots so that you are always ready to attack the next mob immediately after the last one dies. But whenever you need to run for more than a few seconds without attacking a mob definitely turn on aspect of cheetah.
---
I've done another spelling update and it may be the final one. I've written down every single location and googled it to spell check.
---
It should be spelling error free now. The only thing I didn't double check was if there are any names on the map missing, but I've done that already a day ago and I think I've got all of them (3-4 names were missing).
---
Let's hope this was the last update :D
---
I also used to do this and I always had a hammer on the ready to push down a key on the keyboard so I could go afk without disconnecting and end up in queue again.
---
I did not know about the drinking bird back then :P.
---
You could pull an all-nighter with some Mountain Dew and Doritos.
---
Wowhead's company has had really strange interactions with them  - when we contacted them about the contents and old site layout, they stripped more references from Wowhead and went beyond scraping comments to republishing some of my articles without permission and hot linking to Wowhead's CDN on image pages.
---
I've run Mc more times than I can count.   Literally hundreds of times across multiple toons.
---
I've seen a grand total of 4 bindings.
---
Tipsout is banning everyone on stream who ask about the scandal LUL.
---
Family is great and all but The Burning Crusade only releases once.
---
Hawk killing, cheetah for running between killing spots. Ur pet will do the initial pull and by the time you get to the mob he had guaranteed agro. No need to swap between.
---
Had it on full blast while painting this bad boy! You homies can check more of my stuff over on [insta](https://www.instagram.com/conorsmithart/) . God bless
---
It's especially silly because we are getting a version of sharding. Layering is necessary to fix even worse problems.
---
 But it makes sense that the classic crowd is one of the worst at gatekeeping. The idea that you're opinion only matters if you pretend long queue times make a game better is so fucking stupid.
---
I have exactly the same plan. I did two warriors in vanilla, so I’d like something else. I would like to tank 5 mans so druid is really the only other option. They also have an easier time leveling solo (by a lot) and have much better utility in the open world as well as more efficient ways to farm gold. 
---
Still, my heart tells me to go with another warrior. Maybe my only option is to roll both. Send hlep.
---
&gt; I played there during tbc
---
...what?  TBC came *after* Vanilla...
---
Choosing a guild that doesn’t have people complaining every 2 minutes about the streamer that has 500 whole views right now. Every server will have streamers to some extent, I can avoid the communities within the server that beat that dead horse to life and then death again.
---
Vanilla did not have an amazing community like everyone thinks. It was a forced ecosystem which can be recreated if the systems allow for it. There was lots of toxicity in 2005-2006. I remember it being worst at Wrath arenas... just relax you will have an excellent time and the community feel will be back
---
It also wasn’t just for non Raiders it gave raiders a chance to flesh out pieces that you were unlucky with dropping.
---
The real issue with badge gear came at the end with SWP. BIS or near BIS weapons from badges wasn’t the best idea.
---
I was just like this, then i deleted the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client.
---
See ya in 3 months
---
I'm just gonna play until I'm too tired to continue. After that, I'll sleep for a bit, and then probably 4-5 hours later, I'll snap awake when I realize that I can play Classic again. Repeat until Monday when I have to go back to work.
---
My friend built a website for &lt;Hillsbrad Heroes&gt; he really likes the idea of being for the Alliance with world pvp and casual raiding. Some of our group want to remake &lt;Conquest&gt; or go with &lt;Black Shaft&gt; which was an inside joke from high-school lol. Someone suggested it as our guild name back then thinking it would be cool like the arrow that kills Smaug but you know how high-school minds work.
---
Dungeon leveling is very slow compared to questing or grinding.
---
Dude cool
---
yush! thank you for thiss lol!
---
Isn't posting an item on the neutral AH very overpriced and buying it yourself on another faction against the ToS?
---
I dunno, I hit 80 with almost none of Icecrown done and a lot of the other zone left to do. Also half of Scholazar Basin. 
---
Technically also the other starting zone but let's be real I'm not counting that.
---
True, I can see that as a big issue.
---
Badge gear should be decent gear, but not near the best.
---
But this isnt a new game, its a 15 year old game. Every dungeon &amp; raid can be viewed in its entirety online.
---
Well, the beauty of the graphic roll back (still an upgrade on wrath) is that you can run classic on most modern Integrated PCs. As far as, a lot more going on, I hear that. My guild is almost entirely parents. We do Weekend stuff, If you find a weekend guild with like minded people, I think you can have a good time, and keep RL first
---
I like doing all 3 at different parts just for a change of pace. Mid 30s is a great time to just grind some mobs for cash also any grinding done on a warrior inevitably makes questing easier.
---
"Later today, we will take the WoW Classic closed beta down for maintenance and we will increase the level cap from 30 to 40. This will allow testers to level up in zones such as Stranglethorn Vale, Desolace, and Arathi Highlands (among others). At the same time, Warsong Gulch will close.
---
To further assist testing efforts, we will reduce the cost to respec closed beta characters. The new cost will be charged in silver instead of gold, a 99% reduction in cost, and will only be applied to the beta test.
---
We’re also going to open Arathi Basin for limited testing in the closed beta. There will be no templates, so all characters will need to be level 20 or higher to participate. The test will begin on the afternoon of Thursday, June 6."
---
Last sentence of the blue post about beta. But reading it again, they must be referring specifically to the ARATHI BASIN testing starting on 6/6. Wishful thinking I suppose, but personally I believe there WILL be more invites going out before the end. Even if only a few.
---
It adds a layer of depth a mystery to a dungeon when there is only one type.  Then there becomes a lore to the place, and everyone who speaks of it mentions the same place, and all the treasures are the same, and difficulty of conquest.  I liked that Heroics added a lot of end game to TBC, but BRD/Scholo/UBRS/LBRS were fucking special.
---
Provided you don’t have mob competition, questing/grinding is far superior to dungeons. With that being said, if you’re leveling with friends dungeon running is a hell of a lot more fun in my opinion than questing, so I’d go that route, plus there’s likely going to be a ton of competition early on. 
---
Being able to bypass that via instances may make that the superior option.
---
Skinning and tailoring. 
---
Skinning for a little extra vendor trash, and then for gold grinding at 60.  Tailoring for bags.
---
Quest items are always FFA. Why stay and waste time helping get it when he has to level to 60 too?
---
Well if you didn’t have kids, and other life responsibilities, you could not be so “lazy” and no life video games.
---
The color paletes of some of those zones looked bad, Ironforge looked the best but there is no way any pc would be able to both load the world and then load everyone spamming AoE in it.
---
You sir, are a savior. I just recovered my account from there and see I have about 10 or so BC + WOTLK photos from there. &lt;3 all around
---
It was $15 back in the day which means it’s cheaper now due to inflation. The price is completely fair and isn’t changing so get used to it.
---
ah ye, i realised after, but i can't edit a title right?
---
Was this on ND though?
---
Alkizerx has been focusing on his early leveling routes.
---
If your main goal is to level as fast as possible then grind dungeons.
---
If your main goal is to have fun with your buds then quest.
---
True fact on competing for rolls! Didnt even think of that
---
Nah you should still play as a tank if that's what you want to do. Just understand the human psychology of it. It's a game so your enjoyment is important, just be prepared for the fact that your commitment is going to differ from others in your guild (wherever you end up), and may lead to some conflict. It's certainly not too much of a pipe dream to want to be the MT, but I would take the stance of working towards it, don't necessarily jump at the first guild that offers you a spot to MT, but at the same time be open an honest about your goals (both with yourself and with your guild).
---
In Vanilla we had 3 primary tanks. 3 more warriors that could tank if needed, and 2 primary DPS warriors. After killing C'Thun, our MT decided that he wanted to progress faster than what we were, and wanted to see the content further into Naxx. He joined a further progressed guild, but he was open with us. After C'Thun the last thing our raiding core was ready for was another month of wipe fests on some of the tougher bosses in early Naxx, so we were going to take it easy for a few weeks and farm up - he wanted more. He told us he wanted more, and we had people in line to fill in his spot, no hard feelings, just a difference of wants/needs. 
---
Any good guild is going to have multiple MT players, and what I mean by that is multiple players who CAN fill that role, and they'll be utilized for it. Most fights require more than one tank, and rotating the tank duties so that everyone gets experience is also important. Planning to be a tank should be your goal, becoming the Main Tank, should be the stretch goal once you've proven yourself. Tank is a raiding role - Main Tank is a guild role. 
---
More than any other role in Vanilla, the MT was the most similar to a career path in real life. I currently love what I do in my career, and I love working with the people I work with, but that doesn't mean if another firm offered me a more enticing salary and work arrangement that I wouldn't at least consider it.
---
As far as your comment on funneling gear to yourself in your own guild, keep in mind, having one tank that far outgears all the others does you no good when you get to fights like the 3 drakes in BWL, where you need multiple tanks to taunt after shadowflames etc... Having multiple geared/capable tanks is good for morale, good for the guild, and good when you just don't want to do a ZG run, or another attunement run etc... Progression guilds in today's world gear tanks last, because you have a binary job - hold threat, don't die.
---
I’m thinking shadow priest or rogue. I want to do well in duels and Solo WPVP on the horde sides 
---
My gear goal is probably R10 with some pieces from MC and ZG at best. Any thoughts on which class would do better for my goals and gear goal?
---
Thanks
---
Streamers are grinding dungeons because it's more watchable, and because they are already in BiS gear from 30, which makes speed running high level dungeons super easy.
---
However, it's by no means efficient. They had tons of support from viewers and put in tons of hours... Questing is going to be way more efficient for the most part, with the occasional dungeon run when you have a nice set of quests you can crank out in a single run.
---
You don't have to check the launcher, you can check your games page on your account on the Blizzard site. Now that you know, you can check once an hour on mobile.
---
Best podcast! :)
---
It hasent been visable legally for the last 9 years though, that argument dosent work when the game we want to play has not been consistantly around that 15 year period you quote.
---
I had an identical journey and thoughts as you when I lvled my druid on a pserver, I found that you can run a very fun specc at 60 that is resto. Thing is in vanilla hybrid classes are actually hybrid. So a resto druid can deal decent damage in cat if specced pvp etc. Although sometimes I felt like druid was on the weaker side in pvp cause they masters of none but jack of all trades.
---
I guess the question is how important is stealth for you? 
---
If not many other mobile classes like shaman or hunter might be fun.
---
Yes, he’s talking about hard modes. They added more complexity, more damage, etc. It’s similar to the difference in heroic and mythic raids currently, except you made the choice on each boss and you had to “activate” hard mode.
---
Do you have raid plans?
---
The assumption is that they won't increase the level cap to 60. Some streamers don't think it'll even go to 50.
---
The second assumption is that even if they did increase the cap to 60 they wouldn't open any of the raids.
---
You're not going to be seeing world "first" BWL clears on beta.
---
&gt;Ulduars design remains the best in the games entire lifespan
---
I'm not really a fan of XT and Flame Leviathan having hard modes TBH. The main path bosses having optional hard modes I recall created friction, with some people wanting to farm content and gear up to make the fights easier first, and others wanting to attempt progression. It was awkward. Once you pushed past them the interior was perfect, with Kologarn and the Huntress boss not having hard modes but the raid opening up and letting you select which bosses you want to do in which order and handling their hard modes independently.
---
&gt; the next best thing is no raid difficulties and standard progresssion with no catchup vendors.
---
I guess. You had "train leaving the station" syndrome with Burning Crusade. In vanilla WoW progression was so slow, tuning was lax (I never did Naxx though so I can't comment on that), and often you just needed warm bodies, so guilds would bring in fresh blood in vanilla, but in Burning Crusade that paradigm didn't work all that well at times because someone in Kara gear is just not going to cut muster in Black Temple. Being behind an entire tier was a big deal, especially when Blizzard started making fights hard. Badge and catch-up gear made sense in Burning Crusade. It only really got out of hand starting with WOTLK IMO, where ICC was content made for the masses but it was a fourth raid tier. Sunwell never had that problem because it was never meant to be seen by the masses so the catch-up gear didn't have to be as extreme as in WOTLK.
---
"not really"
---
most interesting comment of the century.
---
Why would it kill the hype? Wouldn't it increase the hype?
---
It probably is too many points it was a guesstimate it’s been a few years lol I just know you’re right it wasn’t full prot but it wasnt many points no more then 15 in fury
---
Rollin With My Gnomies.
---
If the only thing that matters to you in the game is gear then the game is poorly designed. Why dont you play retail where you are bombarded with loot? I think vanilla did this way better than TBC, i had fun just playing the game. In TBC it was a lot more just about the loot.
---
I mean hunters are infinitely better at soloing content and managing stuff on their own.
---
If you plan on playing at launch and within 2 months of launch. Take skinning ,Vendor everything but Thick Leather. Save the Thick Leather and post it after the first week. You secondary skill depends on how you plan on making money at 60. This depends on you entirely. Here are the options and the subsequent professions you should take whilst leveling.
---
Blacksmithing - Take Mining. Drop Skin for BS at 60 
---
Engineering - Take Mining. Drop Skinning for Eng at 60
---
Alchemy - Take Herblism, save herbs till 60 then drop skining for Alch
---
Tailoring - Take Mining or Enchanting and save your cloth till 60. Drop skinning for Tailoring.
---
Enchanting - Take Enchanting
---
Leatherworking - Take Leatherworking
---
yeah, this is exactly what i mean, it's terrible really\^^
---
man this is such bullshit. i played TBC for hours a day and grinded my ass off to get a couple pieces of badge gear. it wasn't free epics. i was main tank in a decent guild and got some good gear in raids too but never cleared BT or anything. i had fun playing the game and that's "lazy"? nah this is entitled bullshit.
---
Why are you so worried about people who watch so much streaming that they kill the hype for classic for themselves. Realistically, how many people do you foresee this happening to? 10? 100? 1000?
---
I will consider this. I guess the best way to go is by adapting. If we cant kill anything because of overpopulation of a zone, we will proceed with dungeons.
---
Yeah, the automod seems a bit too op at times. Removing posts that are clearly about classic for not being about classic.
---
Especially if you follow some of the speedrun guides out there, that cut out a LOT of slack in between quests, and prevent as many "loop backs" between quest zones as possible.
---
Full cat DPS feral till you get level 40 talent, then 11 points into balance for 10% melee and omen. The rest into energy talent for power shifting. 
---
This is by far the fastest and most effective leveling spec. You are like a rogue except you get to heal between mobs instead of sitting and eating. 
---
For PvP most of the folks go 0/30/21. Increase Intel for if you want to heal and you still get NS.
---
Google any dungeon from the game and you'll find multiple videos, legal or not it has been "visable"
---
The Horde can call the Alliance the N word
---
Until SWP. Badge gear pre SWP was fine it’s the badge gear added with SWP that is an issue. Not really the strength of gear either, as it was in line with other gear (roughly equivalent to the raids). It was the pieces you could get. 
---
Giving everyone pretty much BIS weapons that don’t require raiding probably wasn’t the best move in hindsight.
---
Not saying fury or arms can't tank, but all they have is plate and dps spec, that's not going to be good for tanking. If it was, then you wouldn't go prot. Less defenses, worse sunder, worse and fewer cooldowns, etc. You're basically claiming a gimped warrior is better than an optimal druid, and while that's not impossible I don't think it's accurate.
---
Well it kinda depends. They are not BoE which is pretty neat. However Traveler's Backpacks are pretty abundant and not that expensive.
---
Drop rates might be scuffed on pservers but I don't remember them being hard to come by back in the day either.
---
Haha thanks again.
---
I don't get the warrior hype, I like the class but...  I was never out dps'd by a warrior on my mage from MC to Naxx, granted I wasn't really out dps'd by anyone other than a mage, sometimes depending on the weakness I'd get beat on Chromaggus.  I think private servers being scaled poorly/incorrectly is skewing the perception of melee dmg being so good.
---
Gotch ya. I probably made a big mistake when i was a kid.
---
If everyone is streaming, who's gonna watch? ;)
---
Tirisfal looked amazing
---
Dunno about why that guy hated it but I hated it as when I was already in a full 5man group I had some idiot continously request to be invited even though I told him we were full. Every time I declined he just requested it again so instead I just left it in limbo until we killed Zalazane and then left group.
---
Sweet!
---
tell this to the people who paid a shit ton of gold to get in my guild's raids to get BT/Sunwell gear
---
I got in yesterday afternoon!
---
Hell yeah I would sign that!
---
Asmongold said they would be able to do BRD at 40. Dunno if it's accurate or not. It's possible because I think Scholomance only required something like 45 when he checked it.
---
There was a guild on my vanilla server called “nine inches unbuffed”
---
Ah, yeah I'm with you man. We shall see!
---
Coasters to maximise the air cooling. 10/10
---
It also had no donation shop whatsoever. Quality + No other fees = best server around
---
i'm excited for the lvl 60 streams when they eventually get into MC.
---
You mean “you and other socially awkward men”
---
What got me onto gnome warrior was getting absolutely annihilated by a female gnome warrior in arena named Kristenbelle. 
---
I finished leveling my tauren warrior and race changed him to female gnome. been on board ever since. frost mages never expect escape artist
---
The stone guard in your party and not recognizing the guilds makes me think this is not from the beta
---
Did Asmon's stream of Deadmines kill the hype for anyone? I doubt a single person thought "Oh well now that I've seen Asmon run deadmines I have 0 interest in doing it myself".
---
Nope, played a nelf hunter and human warrior
---
Dungeon climbs will never be as fast as questing in a normal setting.  I hve not watched many streams but I would guess that they are doing this for many reasons. 
---
1: they don’t want to be ganked 24/7 because they are being sniped.
---
2: they GROSSLY overgear the content and can do stuff like mass pull
---
3: maybe they ran out of quests while they were capped at 30 
---
4: maybe they are farming for blues because they plan on playing the beta at level 40 almost like its end level content getting bis pieces and mats.
---
In a normal setting the quickest thing to do is just quest until you can’t anymore.  Possibly grind mobs if you choose to or you could grind dungeons if you run out of quests if you want to for fun.
---
I wouldn’t reccomend farming dungeons on live because you miss out on a lot of important things like flight paths, rep, and things along those lines.
---
Mage would also be a solid choice.
---
Streamers are only dungeoning because they've done a lot of the quests already and screwed themselves. Plus they have tons of gear from grinding the 30 dungeons already.
---
Your best bet is to just quest unless there's a dungeon that has an item you really need (such as the quest wand for your Priest from BFD).
---
or slap 'em with your shield
---
You know if you really look at it. 
---
The start of the downfall came at the end of vanilla not TBC. That’s when they moved to 1) alternate gearing methods outside of raiding (upgrades dungeon sets) and 2) token system for tier pieces.
---
Personally I don’t think it’s a problem either. Nothing wrong with allowing everyone the ability to progress their character and not gatekeep it to only those who can devote the most time possible to playing.
---
On another private server with slower timeline (which might've caused differences)
---
Your living the dream, as soon as a dungeons quests show up you can grab 2 dps and roll, easy fill. I like doing all the quests until the dungeons quests pop up, grind those out and move on. See you guys in the Eastern plague lands.
---
## You (Alliance) say ƒ Ä 2 ž ž Ä 3 Ÿ ƒ ƒ and Horde will read s m e l l m y a s s
---
And that exactly representation of the classic we get in the new engine?
---
PvP as a Druid has a high skill cap. In PvP you aren't a *Resto* or *Feral*, you're a DRUID and you'll use all of your abilities. In WG you're a pro flag carrier that can get away from the opposing team. In AB you're the ultimate harasser, disrupting stealth caps and keeping your flags guarded. In AV you can pocket-heal as someone tanks the elites, or flip that around and tank them yourself.
---
I short, Druids in PvP are the ultimate flex spot.
---
it is, but you can't buy your own auctions either iirc
---
Read the description. I did. I couldn't find much
---
He's right you chose that lifestyle.
---
Salt. SO MUCH salt. It is hilarious how upset people get because others have something that they don't. Sounds like the world today. "They have something that I don't! WAHHHHH! They don't deserve it, I do because I'm me! WAHHHH"
---
Hope you learn from this mistake of yours.
---
On the internet, the most important thing about writing opinions is how you write it... the way you wrote it was like a statement and nothing in it indicated that it was an opinion, so obviously others will perceive it as a statement instead of an opinion. The fact that you had to correct it afterwards further reinforces how poorly you wrote the original post.
---
Its only your own failure for not reviewing how its written. The way you write english indicates you should have the ability of knowing how to properly construct an opinion.
---
No offense, but your op in its original form sounded exactly like the hate-posts on classic-forums claiming how bad classic is gonna be and how bad the retail-community is.
---
I did several leveling groups in BC. Questing works better.  Then run dungeons when you want gear upgrades or to finish some dungeon quests.  Besides, with a 3 man group like that you'll steamroll in PvP.  You'll have a lot of fun questing on a PvP server.
---
That’s a great point. Thank you for that perspective!
---
Rockbiter for killing low armor mobs, Flame tongue for high armor mobs. WF for pvp, and FB never.
---
I'm generally a fan of the show, but the banning discussing was a cringe-inducing fallacy exchange of absolutism, whataboutism, and "slippery slopes".
---
Yes! One dungeon difficulty and when you get loot it is what it is, you dont have to upgrade it or get titan forging bullshit.
---
I am sure that you are right. In fact, on the stress server, trying to create an opposite faction character brings up a warning that specifically mentions PvP servers.
---
You think wow all of a sudden became easy after classic😊
---
Pugs also existed in classic, getting people to stay logged in and buffed up was the "hard" part, you forget a lot of people were new to mmos with wow being their first. We were ALL new to Wow back then, we got better with practice hopefully. 
---
So yes, most of us should of been conditioned if we started in classic and played throughout, already rank 10~12 boosts being arranged as well as gearing runs for horde side raids, and that's before the game actually comes out for the second time.
---
My main has always been a druid, will be in Classic as well. That said, I am also rolling a warrior because I have a pretty strong desire to be a beefy tank, even if it's just 5 mans.
---
Or a frost mage alt instead of warrior. Goddammit I can't decide. Help.
---
Lich King was a major lore pay-off. Putting him behind a giant barrier and hiding him away from the masses would be a disaster. Many people remember WOTLK fondly because *THEY* killed the Lich King. 
---
That's why, while I think Wildstar had failings, I will always respect the game for separating the lore from the raids. Raids were placed you raided, they weren't the culmination of the story. Their equivalent of the Lich King would be defeated in quests and cutscenes rather than only exclusive to the top 1%. You got the advantage of coherence in immersion (no easy-mode / hard-mode) but without gating pivotal lore away.
---
That's true, forgot they added new badge gear with SWP.  Although to be fair, that was towards the very end of the expansion, they wouldn't release SWP at fresh TBC realms for quite some time
---
Mouse over the little sun (or moon) near the minimap
---
except the vast majority of guilds on the popular tbc server are like 4/6 SSC and loot reaver farm in TK. this is 5 months after launch so people have basically been farming kara/gruul and first few bosses in SSC for months.  i think it's a testament to tbc difficulty in comparison to vanilla where the launch raids aren't getting cleared by non-neet guilds on the first lockout
---
only have time to play for 5 hours a day = LaZy TrAsH
---
They don’t really die easily unless you don’t know how to use your cds.
---
Questing by far is much faster, but I would say solo or duo would be faster. 150xp+(scales with mob level) per mob with quest do ontop of that.
---
I have no idea why people were grinding scarlet monastery for levels in beta yesterday, getting 60 or less do for non elite mobs, and 100 for elites.
---
The only thing I ever hated about Vanilla was the death timer. To me theres no reason to have it, it just spoils world pvp for me when you have to wait 5 minutes to get back up and join the fight again.
---
There's videos that compare hunter dps from MC to Naxx, they see one of the smallest upgrades compared to other classes. So you're never going to hit major power spikes like a warrior getting a new weapon etc, but 90% of hunters won't even see inside AQ40 and Naxx.
---
I want to try and buff players as they fly past Hogger!
---
your probably ok 2h tanking rfc, but everything after that it would be better to have a shield.
---
G G XP P WQA0paq#
---
I thought XT was an amazing fun fight . I thought it was fine that fight was so hard you did it on hardmode later with better gear to feed into your vehicle. I just love overall the idea of doing something in a fight that makes it harder for better loot. I also thought 10man was tuned well for Ulduar considering the size. 
---
Agree with what you gave to say about TBC. I was entering college and could no longer no life WoW. So much raid content and the train left me at the station with bad struggling guilds who farmed Kara and Gruuls got seemingly forever. 
---
Really hyped for classic because of the amount of raids and things to do.
---
Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but prior to this addition, you could see the time by mousing over the little sun (or moon depending on time of day) near the minimap, right?
---
It's J I A F F iirc.
---
To me it’s the fact that weapons were obtainable via badges more than the gear itself.
---
Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it won't be done. Doesn't matter if they're on retail or another game like FFXIV, the chain pulling at all cost mentality is in full swing everywhere. Other people's experience/stress be damned.
---
I once mentioned I played the game called "Ring of Elysi.."
---
Its just like H1Z1 and PuBG. I got an automated massage telling me I could not mention it. I replied and Soupa accepted it.
---
For Elys I get it. Its not related in any way but we should be able to say LHC's full name.
---
reported
---
I’m planning on leveling a mage to 60. I plan on leveling an alt with gold funneled to them and I’m thinking warrior or rogue because I can keep up their gear. Any other options sound good?
---
It was clear to everyone he was not meming this is also against the rules so I am reporting you. also you seem to have a very hard time understanding the basics of the english language. I could offer some lessons if you need the help as serveraly as you seem too. 
---
&gt; death coil once every 2 minutes is "rotation" 
---
I listed about 5-6 spells it seems your math abilitty is also down the shitter lol.
---
Gotta get me one of those integrated PCs
---
Whats the difference to him spamming inv in chat?
---
TBC raiding was simply better because of variety in specs and gear.  It's hard to gear 10 rogues in the same gear, but easy to gear three types of paladins and two types of priests, etc etc.  You also have to consider the turn in for gear, which even if the drops were the same it would be better.  The amount of times tier gear rotted because no one needed it in BWL was annoying.  
---
However, I will tell my own story.  I main tanked as a warrior for for months killed 4... 4 bosses that dropped shields, Gruul, The ZA boss, third boss in Hyjal and Illidan, and didn't see one drop for months.  I was rocking the Nightbane shield in nearly full tier 6 before I got a shield to drop.  Every time we killed a boss and one wouldn't drop laughter exploded on vent.  Damn depressing.    
---
Yes gearing a 25 man raid was easier, but I don't think that means fuck all when people consider which raiding experience was better. All of the multifaceted reasons TBC was better the ease of obtaining gear is not even in the top 10.
---
We live in 2019, almost every serious PC gamer has 2 monitors, one for gaming and one for social meda/netflix/youtube
---
PS: I am the only one of my friends who doesn't do this
---
Care to share some issues ? I’ve only played like two of them and dropped them too fast to know the rest
---
maybe 3/4 of a sunken temple in the same time frame. Depends how many times you get lost.
---
Nah it’s usually the player. Rogues are not hard to level.
---
Questing is for Exp. Dungeons are for Gear. Gear is for faster Questing.
---
I can't wait to go back home.
---
he means having more points in fury than in prot.
---
I wouldn't think about what is the fastest, do what is more fun. I'm going to do quest and level, you'll get varied scenery, stories and all the good stuff. Grinding dungeons is doing the same content over and over again.
---
I miss my Microsoft intellimouse blue! That mouse lasted me a solid 5 or so years. It was perfectly balanced, light weight and accurate. They don’t make them anymore or else I would probably still use one.
---
Ye well, this  is the problem... people only say it but theres no video proof. Im sure atleast some high end guilds would have kill videos which show this? idk.
---
But the talent builds in vanilla were mostly hybrid in every case, since noone went for pure one talent tree but  rather one tree and half into another... so was that how it went down? tanks went deeper into fury but still quite deep into protection to get the necessary defense-talents.
---
Why ban the word when you can easily bypass it all together by saying pserver, k3, lights h0pe, unofficial server etc
---
Is reckbomb viable on classic? Thinking about a rogue opening with 4 crits could be easy to deal with
---
You can have 2 accounts, and buy your own auction posted, it's just costly but not against the tos, was done a lot back when it was relevant
---
Its a spell, so are the other 5 I have listed on this post, you guys just ignore everything that I argue.. its so pathetic.
---
Yeah a lot of activity occurs in Darrowshire, that place is forever ruined.
---
Depends what his goal is. If he’s looking to be a top tier raider/hardcore guild say something. If he’s going to be a casual raider or just do 5 man dungeons then don’t bother.
---
I main a warrior and went out of my way to bring an enhancement shaman with any time I didn’t have a shaman healer for that wind fury totem for 5 mans. Just made everything go so much faster.
---
I can afford the stand, but nothing else from their Pro line-up.
---
AG EE OO P
---
Wait, they already addressed this?  So fucking hyped even more now.
---
There is little point in planning. I believe on launch it is going to be a log on roulette followed by how fast you can't get out of level 5 and 10 zones. If you win in both you should definitely quest, do dungeons for the quest and any time you feel like you got a good dungeon group suggest another run or two. From what I remember you never had enough quests in the zone to get you to the next zone. AOE grind only works if you are alone, so leveling an alt on an established server. There is no way ppl will let you collect 10 mobs and not interfere.
---
if i would create my own then &lt;the less the lazier&gt; contrary to the more the merrier
---
WotF is overhyped as a racial. It'll be annoying, but you have other methods of dealing with undead players other than fear. In other words, don't be deterred by one racial.
---
I was trying this out on a funserver.  It takes way way way too long.  Crafting is literally sitting there for hours doing actual nothing.  It's better to run an instance once for the quests and get gear.  The only justifiable professions that don't suck up do much times while leveling are skinning and enchanting (disenchanting everything you can't use).
---
Yeah it's silly. Private server discussion is often pretty relevant in discussing Classic, despite the irrational haters. I can understand removing posts for promoting them and such, but outright banning the names just means people have to get creative when talking about them.
---
Fourthrail 4 life btw.
---
Atleast you can hang yourself on the Apple stand once you notice the mistake you made.
---
Grow up, you cretin, and use a sock everyone else in the western civilized world.
---
Hunter is amazing solo.
---
I'm 48 and I still don't do my own laundry
---
they aren't testing their routes or anything though. Like most of them have been pvping/gearing, apart from 1 or 2 alt runs of leveling max for monkey
---
Upvotes for both of you.
---
It was a lot of work!
---
How the fuck is gearing easier in TBC holy shit you actually delusional. 
---
I'm no tbc fan boy, I rate it worse than vanilla and wrath, but it's not easy to get loot. Wrath has that though.
---
The content is the same. Health values, proc chances, pathing and some AI with mobs were what private servers got wrong. While those do make for some big changes, no one will be surprised by what they encounter in raids in vanilla unless you are completely new to the game.
---
Skinning/herb then switch to alch/herb if soloing a lot, or alch/enchan to make money from shard runs in DM.
---
I haven't seen any mentions of a different way to Ironforge, rather than running through wetlands.  If you swim west from Menethil Harbor into this second inlet, if you drown in dun morogh your ghost will spawn at the starting area spirit healer.
---
The zero HP teleportation trick.
---
I had to get back into the classic mindset as I was playing through the beta.  Gear matters, it was a good idea to dungeon with a dedicated group, and I spent a lot of time grinding on -2 level mobs.   And yes, I would craft my own weapons and armor - while grinding, I built up a lot of materials anyway, so why not
---
Og mc progression conquest?
---
The sad part with this is that some people still find that worth. There will always be ninjalooters, and will probably be more of them once Classic launches.
---
And no one is?
---
I did this in the stress test with my Night Elf lol. Was fun being in Elwynn.
---
You seem to completely miss the point.
---
It isn't the fact that "Nostralrius created vanilla to help Blizzard", as that's obviously not true.
---
Nostalrius was based on the development of MaNGOS, which deserved all the credit on that front.
---
However, Nostalrius used the fact that they got a seize and desist letter from Blizzard to start a petition within their huge fanbase to appeal for Blizzard to create their own official version instead, which got a [huge backing, with added support from Mike Morhaime.](https://www.change.org/p/mike-morhaime-legacy-server-among-world-of-warcraft-community).
---
I'm pretty sure the point of OP is that we wouldn't be here without Nostalrius.. not because of their "coding", but because of their ability to unite the community to crave official classic.
---
Sub Optimal, Casually Inefficient, Thanks I Hate It, Azeroth Dance Team, Bored At Work, Keyboard Turner, Control Alt Rage Quit.
---
Me when I clicked on this sub link: No, nuh uh, nope. It'll change the spirit of the game.
---
Me after watching the video: Jaw on floor
---
So youre upset that what you find enjoyable about WoW is different from others and your opinion/experience should trump others?
---
If it will be anything like what private servers have been the last couple of weeks, expect questing to take a VERY long time. any single mob quests were taking over an hour.
---
on a related note:   
---
You should check out the Amish Challenge that a bunch of streamers are doing, with some casual RP. They are doing permadeath, and are only using gear they craft themselves (with in-group trading, but minimal auction house / external trading). The exception is they can use weapons and trinkets / necklaces / rings from dungeons. And finally, no complimentary skills, to encourage trading among themselves.
---
some of the streamers doing this are:
---
[Criken](https://www.twitch.tv/criken)
---
[Strippin](https://www.twitch.tv/strippin)
---
[Lawlman](https://www.twitch.tv/lawlman)

---
[BrettUltimus](https://www.twitch.tv/BrettUltimus)
---
[GameWithMe](https://www.twitch.tv/gamewithme)
---
and a bunch more, not all of them stream it, but most of those mentioned above do.
---
Theres tons of old pvp videos of Shamans tearing it up in BGs and WPvP. Elemental could explode people, Windfury procs could explode people. My roommate ran resto and they were sick pvp healers, just very heavily targeted so try to play with someone who can peel for you.
---
Druids will definitely be underrepresented, and they're gonna be good flag carriers for sure.
---
It'll be pretty hard as you can only get one.
---
If you're healing, the weapon spec won't matter much. Even while leveling, you can just out-level something by one level to make up the difference.
---
Stoneform will be more beneficial than Perception if you have consecration since you can rank 1 that to keep rogues at bay, and having that bonus defensive ability will make you very difficult to kill in PvP.
---
In PvE healing, neither racial active will help much, but Stoneform is the definite win even if it sees somewhat less use than PvP.
---
Nice meme dude
---
The only thing I'm going to say on this is that it's unique.
---
Streaming is nothing more than free advertising by fraudsters, losers, and the wicked.
---
Wait, apple actually made a $1000 monitor stand? I saw posts about this and assumed it was a meme, is it actually real?
---
I mean the thing stands at like 20 inches tall.  You better get creative with that
---
Hunter will be oom before the Pala as dispel is cheaper. Besides u can’t kite well in duels due to forfeit range. Hunter is the best at 40 but not at duels due to limited range
---
Go to the Classic Forum on the WoW forums. Add to the post that is there. I want a blue answer.
---
Thick and Rugged were the only ones I put on the AH on private servers. Vendored everything else.
---
you don't wanna watch Asmon raiding MC and saying over and over again "oh look at all these streamers here. so many streamers in this raid. wow a whole raid full of streamers. wow i can't believe this many people stream" ?
---
Priest stuff, excellent!
---
Am I right gamers?
---
Well, for one, it's unique, so that's literally impossible.
---
But you're gonna be practically last in line for TF anyway.
---
I distinctly remember doing this during WOTLK though. Was it changed at some point?
---
You're welcome bud.
---
I did this one a night elf hunter last stress test, I got teleported to the Kharanos graveyard
---
https://i.ibb.co/5j2TQc5/crisp.jpg they're perfect! Any chance I could get permission to use them? If so, PM me details about who/how you want to me give credit.
---
Honestly it’s doable but that’s gonna be brutal. Deadmines alone take 2-3 hours if you are under levelled and undergeaeed
---
When i did this on the stress test i was ported to the Khranos graveyard and not the starting area.
---
I had too much experience falling asleep at keyboard during D2 all nighters. So much experience that I had been conditioned to rolling to the couch by the time dota and wow came out.
---
IIRC it's unique, but I don't think that matters as you can't even obtain the quest a second time. 
---
So no, you have no chance to get 2 of them.
---
I think priest would do better with during phase 1 and phase 2 while you get your rank.  You would probably have to heal, maybe not required to respec, but heal nonetheless for those MC pieces.  
---
However as phases advanced if you didn't replace your gear ever people getting rank 13 and filling in with BWL and later AQ gear will eat you alive.  On spriest in particular you are basically forced to tank every dps.  At that point rogue would be better, rogue can be more control orientated and cooldown based, where with appropriate CDs they can kill people above their geat level, and with stealth avoid fights outside of the CDs.
---
Overall, my first character was a priest, and I highly disliked shadow in world pvp.  The issue is wpvp is dynamic and only rarely a 1v1, shadow lacks any mana tools, and early on without great spellpower it often takes your entire mana pool to kill someone, so even when you dominate every 1v1 fight, you auto lose 1v2s since you legit just lack the mana.  This is exacerbated by their lack of long CC that could be used to reset a fight.  
---
I ended up rerolling mage solely for poly and evocation.
---
Troll shadow priest
---
What do you cast as soul link? Shadow bolts cast time is pretty long, so just dots and life drain?
---
There will be new people for sure, seeing MC or Ony won't kill their hype imo because its not like they will be doing those encounters right away. Its literally 100+ hours of gameplay before they can even think about raiding. If anything would kill their hype its seeing how long the journey to 60 is.
---
They better cap our FPS at 15 and limit us to 800x600 on low settings then. Really get that authentic feel. /s
---
/u/Teeb provided the images. Whatever he thinks is just.
---
But.... We know what it looks like? All the people that made the petition are going to be play, private server people are probably also going to play?
---
If it had been a brand new, never before seen game, then sure, makes sense not to show it.
---
I certainly could not do that in TBC. IDK if that was introduced between 1.12 and when I tried it.
---
Exactly this.  The badge gear pre swp was on par with heroic last boss gear.  In order to get these pieces you had to clear content that was rewarding you similar gear.  
---
Then the swp vender just got silly, giving you t6 equip gear with running heroics... yeah no thanks.
---
Hah, naxx being hard, with gear and all 40 people logging and stay logged in, as long as most of you could dance and knew simple mechanics you will be golden.
---
It's all about resistance and having gear from previous raids
---
Okay thanks. How does SL actually play? There isn't much info on it. I only tried it briefly but was assuming you just DoT and life drain?
---
Yeah basically there was no interface for doing hard or normal mode. You selected the raid size 10 or 25 and depending on your performance In the fight you could activate hard mode during the boss . One of the bosses you had to kite dwarves into flame breaths and get a bunch killed to activate the hard mode because you are essentially sitting in a difficult phase longer . You did things mid fight and you would be rewarded with heroic gear . Check out the heroic meta achievement for ulduar it goes into every fights hard mode trigger.
---
Yeah for me I can’t remember fully but there was a little bit into arms slightly more into fury and then most went to prot and I stole that off our server first guilds mt we cleared everything eventually but we were like 3/4 in the server didn’t raid 5 nights a week like the top 2 that duked it out
---
Just put on some music/shows, and do the quests and follow the breadcrumbs to victory.  Running instances past the completion of quests for a specific piece of gear is a waste of time.  Grinding AoE mobs will likely be too much competition for it to be worthwhile.  Quest quest quest, and watch all six seasons of Game of Thrones.
---
I mean.. no one can inspect his spec so he could be enhancement all he wants and just sell ele
---
But if you want to use VESA, you just have to pay $200 for their adapter.
---
Damn my dreams have been crushed, in less tha a min... Thanks you guys for replying :(
---
What are you talking about? I dont understand
---
We've been in contact before. Thank you!
---
Just sayin, thunderfury is actually a trash weapon for hunters.  There are literal level 30 items better for you.
---
Something to address that specifically is mouse over macros.
---
Weapon specialization doesn't matter in BGs for PvP: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-weapon-skills
---
Spirit isn't particularly useful for paladin but perception is nice. 
---
Keep in mind the dwarf frost resist will be useful against mages in PvP and a few bosses in Naxx.
---
Stoneform is useful for the bleed and armor but you can dispell everything else anyways but the immunity for the duration is still important and armor is a big deal in vanilla so when you get jumped by an arms war and rogue it will be a big CD to stay alive.
---
I rate dwarf racials over human for healing in pvp for sure.
---
Any guild that gives a TF to a hunter ever is taking the piss. Also you can only equip one of them.
---
Lol good luck man.
---
Ok I guess I understand. But when I talk to other human beings like my friends, I don't say in my opinion, I say what I think; and what I think is my opinion. What I think is not fact and that goes for everyone. I don't think I know everything. I think the real problem is the hostility on the internet and people assuming others intent. My post wasn't the least bit toxic, yet everyone is acting like I just peed in their cereal for speaking my mind. All I learned here is no one actually wants to talk about the topic at hand. Just stupid fucking grammar and sentence structure.

Good to know we had 2 or 3 holy pallys in our raid and they all had the best hps and were the designated tank heals so my plan was to do holy pally, prot war and a warlock this time I only had a hunter rouge war last time and unless I was tanking I wasn’t really required in raids cause Dps was a dime a dozen
---
I like taking the /played when I get to the 19.5th bar.  That way I have an idea of how much time it took to get through each level.  It is a headache trying to match up level 30 played time with level 29 played time to get the interval time it took to reach level 30.
---
Conquest has downed rag!
---
If I were tanking or even just a member for your guild and  you took Thunderfury for the sole reason you were GM I would quit without hesitation
---
Hunter is basically the easiest class to play decently but one of the harder classes to master. 
---
I would recommend it to noobies
---
Absolutely agree. TBC was the best era in terms of raiding content and classes but it was the beginning of the end in terms of loot systems, attunement removal, flying mounts, removal of old content.
---
The main tank will get it and, He'll be lucky too. It's rare real rare. It's not just something you automatically get.
---
Incredibly unrealistic. Thunderfury always goes to Prot Warriors first. Then it's Fury Warriors and Rogues. It also depends on what system your guild is using.  Need rolls vs Greed, DKP, etc. It greatly depends on how you manage your guild and assembling 40 people for a night, or several nights in a row. Shaman would probably get it before you too. Hunters are next to last to ever get this, if it even drops. You can't wield two silly : P Unique items.
---
Pretty sure it wasn't a joke considering OPs response, but awesome maturity to bring up Autism in a form of insult.
---
I have the client but I'm not going to be subbing until name reservations start. You can just pass the time with private servers until then.
---
Ohh you mean like weapons with agility?
---
I remember quite a bit about the pain of rolling on illidan on vanilla launch, last night at nessingwary was exactly the same experience
---
30 people in a zone on the same quest chain with no ezmode phasing or respawn timers.
---
Finding 12 tigers took forever, pvp was there but it was nothing unexpected or overboard.
---
Plan all you want, release is going to be a shit show for months.
---
Depends on the class.  
---
Some quests are definitely worth doing, like the chain quests in Duskwood, the ones for the Deadmines, the grinding ones in STV etc... Most of them are worth XP wise and gear wise, which will accelerate your grinding.  
---
Overall, dungeons are not worth it, except if you have quests, or if you need a piece of gear in the dungeon.  
---
Grinding will always be the most efficient, given the fact that you know what you're doing, that you're chainpulling and that you have consumables.
---
Cool, just put a very tiny reference if he is mentioned anywhere. If not then don't mention it at all.
---
I was on one called "Nagas with attitude"
---
What the fuck does this thread have to do with streamers? Does this shit ever get old to you? 
---
Give it a fucking break dude, holy crap.
---
Realistically, it’s supply/demand
---
If there are loads of alchemists then mining is gonna be a HUGE moneymaker because it feeds blacksmithing *and* engineering.
---
Weapon is unique and quest isn't repeateable. Not possible.
---
Haha. Wrong.
---
&gt; before the Pala as dispel is cheaper
---
you mean cleanse skill? dont know much about pala but it isnt an level 42 spell
---
Pretty awesome.
---
Lits Hope Chapel

I think the standard of griefing is straightforward, and I'm surprised no wanted to defend teleporting the players interfering with the dueling tournament.
---
If there is literally zero gameplay defense of activity, and it is purposely disruptive, then it's griefing and suspendable.
---
Things that do NOT fall into this bucket:
---
- Killing lowbies repeatedly in a town
---
- Corpse camping
---
- Disrupting raids or players attempting to congregate in game by killing them
---
- Essentially anything that relates to killing and combat will be very hard to argue against. This is the world of warcraft, and combat is the game.
---
Things that should be considered greifing:
---
- players flooding or otherwise interfering with the auction house with no intention of making money, just to make it unusable 
---
- this exact example at hand: players of the same faction who are egregiously disrupting a widely organized activity with no intention of contributing 
---
- actions that are taken outside of the intentions of the game that cause a major disruption to gameplay, where the players at hand have no reasonable way to avoid it.
---
For example, a shaman who is casting Water Walk as people jump off a zeppelin/etc into water. Admittedly hilarious. Now, if there was literally no way to avoid this it would be griefing and suspendable (because you know for a fact there would be people standing there all day killing people of the same faction). But because it is easily avoidable it's not suspendable griefing. 
---
In short, if it feels unavoidable, and not remotely in the spirit of the game systems as they were intended, and it is very disruptive, we as a community should encourage suspensions.
---
Shut up?
---
Wait what's wrong with tips?
---
Hahaha this was a serious classic. I remember watching each episode on release
---
Lol this guy saying shaman is the shittiest healer and least fun to play. There’s a reason raids like to bring EIGHT shamans. Because they have good heals and amazing totems.
---
I mean like there are better weapons with better stats for hunters like more agi from level 30 items.  Taking thunderfury as a hunter isn’t just greedy, it’s pretty dumb because it isn’t even good for you.
---
Lol I was dead serious.
---
&gt; There will be new people for sure, seeing MC or Ony won't kill their hype imo  Its literally 100+ hours of gameplay before they can even think about raiding. If anything would kill their hype its seeing how long the journey to 60 is. 
---
This isnt what we were arguing, I was arguing that the beta is obstensively a press release and should be treated as such, don't give two shits about your opinion on "hype" or anyone elses as they are not relevent to what I was speaking to. 
---
&gt; and again as a new player they can simply google "vanilla molten core" and watch the raid there, having people stream it doesn't change anything. 
---
It certainly does, it creates talk and an environment where people have to change off of things to avoid seeing them.
---
Thanks again for having me on the show. Your podcasts have been great for this community.
---
Lol! I would wear them with pride!!
---
Weirdly, my second monitor does not have a clock on the taskbar.
---
I didn’t mean for him to apologize for anything. If people enjoy to powerlevel that’s awesome.
---
I mean there are constant things arcanite bars can do. Come phase 2 paladin mount. Thunderfury. Warriors always need that helm. Etc
---
Yes I level it.
---
Remember that classic is before the change that fishing only required 1 skill to fish pools so your STV fishing tourney is going to require 225+  fishing to fish without "fish got away" messages. 
---
(lures, poles and what not all contribute to that)
---
Please note that the fishing quest for artisan fishing requires level 35+ and 225 fishing skill to unlock.
---
Automod is terrible
---
Good2know.. Thx
---
I would not use that for leveling, but you might have fun with it and that's all that matters. Balance leveling is pretty darn slow and grindy due to the amount of drinking you have to do, which also translates into more money spent. If anything, put the points into feral first then snag Furor. After that, I think you could sink points into balance and start collecting some variety of spell damage/caster gear.
---
The efficiency of feral leveling is just crazy, you need good gear to make balance viable and even then it isn't at the same level. But, like I said, if you want to try it and you find it fun, then who cares?
---
Thats actually very true. I work in Behavioral health education. We have nonstop seminars about attention span. The average 15 yr old actually has less then a 7 second attention span. Its why Vine and TikTok are so popular with the yongins.
---
I really like this style of upgrading the graphics. Staying true to the vibe but making everything a little more polished.
---
WoW retail looks like it should be in the Torchlight franchise. I LOVE the Torchlight games, but I really don’t like how the TL style looks on WoW. If you haven’t played WoW recently, watch the link below and compare it to how TL or TL2 look. 
---
If they wanted to change the art style to the cartoony vibe it currently is, they should’ve just made a new franchise imo.
---
https://youtu.be/0OFlKaj_jAc
---
It will not be the same, people can pretend it will be the same and refuse to evolve or they can adapt and still have fun. 
---
Just because it's not the same doesn't mean it can't be amazing in its own way, but people refusing to see the change and accept it will be the ones who are going to be dissapointed.
---
Also there was toxicity back in classic but a lot of people knew how to make the best of it and not just cry about it.
---
Hmmm I might...
---
I’m coasting for the first week or so to make sure I’m on a decent server. Just keeping open the possibility I might want to change servers for whatever reason. That’s far more important to me than pushing levels for week 1-2
---
Tooltips
---
Not sure since I would mine the crystals and buy transmutes, but they were about 5-10 gold per xmute early on.
---
Ahhh it's so fucking gorgeous.
---
I really wanted a reforged version of wow.  We are getting wc3 reforged, now I want season 7 of wow classic to be the reforging patch that updates the terrain, objects, and models to 2019 BFA/WOD style textures.  They are already doing some of the old zones as warfronts, so hopefully the art assets will be useful when or if they decide on reforging wow.
---
Yes cleanse but dunno what lvl they get that
---
He was serious, but thanks for giving me a reason to click the button.
---
I agree with this, with the caveat that bear is actually better than cat for levelling. 
---
Even with full cat dps talents, bear form was only marginally slower at dps but insanely tankier, letting you chain mobs at a *much* faster rate and needing to heal far less regularly.
---
I wanted so bad for cat to be superior to bear with talents but it just ain’t
---
I would tell you "next time promise"..
---
I plan to go dual gathering, and buy the gear that is being sold for less-than-cost so people can level their professions.
---
ee oo ss    =  lo ve me
---
I could get behind this
---
first phase of badge gear was great.  it was resist gear and trinkets/rings/neck pieces and you only got badges from heroics, which are on average harder than karazhan, so farming the couple easy heroics for a piece will take a while.  
---
the ZA/sunwell stuff is 100% catch up gear.  late tbc really ramped up the casualization with the leveling nerfs, attunement removals, badges out the ass, OP magisters terrace gear (fun dungeon though) but it's funny that these changes coincide with arguably the most hardcore raid ever released.
---
I had Thunderfury on my Rogue in Vanilla. In my first guild the Main tank got the binding first, then the same binding went to an offtank, then I got it because I basically begged for it and our 2 tanks already had it. Then I moved guilds and the other binding I needed dropped, so they gave me it. It's probably better for a Maintank if I'm being honest, but for PvP on a Rogue it was honestly the most fun I've had in a game, you literally lit people up, the proc sounded awesome and I was a complete wrecking ball in BGs. In pve the damage was very good, but it needed to be main handed to be worth while and as a fast weapon it's not ideal.
---
I can't wait to be the only troll rogue in existence :p
---
Nah, eeeeeverybody on PVE servers that wanted another toon did it.
---
If that's true then yeah I dont want it.. Thanks i'll look into these lengendary lvl30 weapons you speak of..
---
I made a druid on a private server and so far I've tanked and healed onyxia with the 0/30/21 spec
---
I want to have a PVP focused alt that I probably won’t raid on (outside of pugs or filling in spots randomly for our “B team”). Is there a class/spec that is able to get relatively well geared for PVP using just crafted items, boe’s, quests, etc?
---
Cant wait to do thid. And duskwood in general
---
Thanks im going to need it!
---
There are certain items that give you a vendor benefit for crafting, though. The Silk Headband comes to mind. Vendor price for cloth+thread is 18.5 silver, item sells for 29.08 silver. Lots of lower leatherworking recipes have a net vendor value, as well.
---
By making silk headbands, you make each piece of silk cloth worth ~2.35 silver, up from 1.5. That is creating something from nothing.
---
You could absolutely do it in vanilla on PVE servers. I did it many many times, but as others have pointed out, you lose a good chunk of it to the AH.
---
What problems specifically? Out of the loop here.
---
"Blizzard shouldn't give people the option to watch their game because some people are impatient."
---
&gt; I enjoyed TBC more than vanilla.
---
Mmm hmm. I only care about classic to the extent that it is a stepping stone towards a much larger prize - TBC. Vanilla is good, a solid 8/10 - a strong starting point for a game, but it is the starting point. But given how rich the gaming landscape is right now, an 8/10 isn't necessarily going to win my attention.
---
TBC is a 9/10 beast though. Everyone in TBC can find something meaningful to do. Better community aspects, better class balance, better casual end-game activities, better PvP, better dungeons, better raids, better aesthetic, better lore, better everything. **TBC is just better.** 
---
Text is an unfortunate medium because when you're talking to someone in real life, you can press your "force of will" upon them and they can just feel the energy and excitement you feel - they will know how much you care about it. Text doesn't have that. Someone in a block of text can say they like classic more than TBC but you can't actually "feel" the hollow emptiness of their words in text because there's no energy behind them - they're just words.
---
Yes, you didnt just touch the top of IF&lt; you dove into the city, then turned back around. It was pretty dumb tbh.. but, compared to having to get back on the taxi, it was amazing.
---
Reminds me of getting censored on an FPS game forum because I used a synonym for charging a firearm.
---
I can ignore his spam in chat, when he requests for an invite using whatever WoW qol fuckery that is the invite request a UI box pops up dead center of my screen that says, "ANNOYINGFKR has requested to join your group! Accept or Decline?"
---
you almost never need to hardcast shadowbolt. drain life and searing pain can be interchanged depending on what school of magic is kicked. searing pain is higher dmg which is why you can bait kick with drain life.
---
this is sO GOOD. this is why this game is good!!!!
---
Planned my work so I prob free for 7 days from release day :)
---
Politics aside, going from the title to this comment isnt really a stretch
---
Can confirm. I run WoW on my shitty pentium silver $300 work laptop when my boys are visiting me for the weekend and they take up my good PCs.  
---
Orgrimmar is still a struggle but outside of it, it runs fine. 30-40fps on low-med settings
---
Couple errors.  
---
1) GCD for rogues is 1 second. 
---
2) Blood Fury doesn't become more powerful as the rogue acquires more gear because it's based on Base attack power.
---
3) Troll Regeneration is *not* robust for rogues because rogue regeneration is like .5 spirit + 9.  Trolls get 10% more of that and 10% to continue in combat.  So 100 spirit would bet them ~6.5 hp/tick.  I don't really see that as being enough to make a difference in most raid situations.
---
Trolls are still a great Race, don't get me wrong. They just aren't min-maxed as Orc for PvE!
---
Neat dude, you played classic too!?
---
Hey!
---
These mods are fucking dumb. Like the community wont either find a work around or force things to change. Just let people discuss any relevant topics.
---
Yeah for most uni students itll no longer be summer holiday. Classes start 8/26 for me. No Classic summer for the majority of teachers and students :(
---
Seriously
---
Oh look, it's Thread Nr. 10,000 on the subject.
---
&gt;What if the new content didn't actually give objectively more powerful gear
---
What if we had 3 molten core variants? Then guilds would get triple the amount of loot per week, we have loot inflation, and the game becomes BfA like.
---
&gt;A new zone or dungeon or raid open only for a limited time, perhaps returning with regular intervals?
---
Sooooo, the same shit as timewalking, essentially.
---
Your guild will disband the moment you say : "I want the bindings for my Hunter".
---
I'd say that you chances to have TF, as a Hunter, are as good as winning the lottery in all countries simultaneously.
---
I would be like no fuk you greedy hunter. I would however want to see a hunter with said weapon that wasnt in my guild
---
Unless I'm GM in which case I can just take it.. Cause i'm the leader..
---
Skinning and tailoring has been very profitable in beta. I can make 10 slot bags that require heavy leather and sell them faster than I can make them. Made a ton of gold so far. Just have to be willing to some cloth. Fishing is also fairly profitable

---
Hemo was mostly considered a noob spec in classic but people took it when they had a powerful weapon from naxx.
---
It depends on the class, Hemo will be weak against hunters, warriors, etc but semi good against rogues and mages, probably marginally if at all better than other builds.
---
I love the guild.
---
Not really, I just broke down how I interpreted it when I read it. If you think I am wrong, feel free to provide your own interpretation. 
---
My only point is that I see no reason to believe it is temporary. Especially when it can be customized by the user, and they went through the trouble of adding a setting to disable it.
---
They actually still had the function to cancel flights in classic think all they did was revert the change and it went back to the old animation.
---
I did not say that. Ofc people enjoy different ways of playing.
---
I’d really like to raid but I don’t know if I can justify the time commitment to myself in my current life situation. 
---
I suppose I could raid in pugs or super casual guilds, but in that case my class will probably not matter.
---
I mean to say that if you’re going for top notch speed, I wouldn’t bother even talking to the hunter trainer until level 4.
---
Badges were awesome. As the gear was interesting in the beginning and later you could get jewelcrafting mats, badges were needed whole till the end of TBC. So I ran Karazhan every week even without needing the gear. Every week I invited random guys, could recruit some of them for later raids, met new friends and showed newcomers how the raid worked. It was simply awesome!
---
Well, to watch the NPCs pwning the evil mastermind is a bit discouraging too. No perfect solution really.
---
Let them burn out and do the testing for you... What's the matter with you, the real game start August 27, beta character will be erased and long forgot after a few weeks in.
---
Sorry, missed the link the first time. Just added a video from Inside Gaming about their layoffs and staff leaving.
---
&gt; A player can respec relatively easily
---
I mean sure. But if you roll a priest to play shadow or pally to play ret and find out at 60 that nobody wants to raid with you if you don't play a certain spec. Then it must be somewhat disappointing.
---
&gt; And every PvP guild will need at least one of every class for premades.
---
That's true I guess. But some specs and classes can be heavily favored over others.
---
Do you believe Blizzard will start balancing Classic at some point? I can only see it happening after 3+ years and they see a huge decline in playerbase.
---
&gt; which then results in more and more calls for perfect balance, and results in normalization and blandness.
---
Your conclusion here isn't universally true. While perfect balance probably never will happen. It doesn't have to lead to normalization and blandness. It totally depends on how the balancing is done and to what scale.
---
&gt;But, except that, you will make plenty of gold, without the need of respeccing. Just make sure that only the talents are 17/3/31.
---
Im curious, why run 17/3/31 instead of 18/2/31?
---
Yes, but you could only see server time. This clock has settings for 24h mode and local time.
---
I leveled a druid much later, but still in vanilla. From what I remember bear form was a warrior with two abilities, heroic strike and poor version of sweeping strike, hitting 3 enemies for flat damage. Sooooo I am not sure how you would kill things faster. 
---
In cat you had 2 bleeds and claw with pretty good white damage in-between.
---
\*grabs second bucket of popcorn\*
---
Nooo they don’t want to recreate private servers as they are now because they are not accurate. They want to recreate vanilla servers but with layering, and that layering only for the first phase to accomadate the launch pop
---
&lt;script&gt; and the sister guild &lt;/script&gt;
---
Even worse, you’d be seeing a stream of Asmon. Those usually go like this “alright boys, let’s get this done. Let’s get this done. Let’s go! Oh man this is amazing. This is amazing. Everything is so amazing. Wow all these feelings are so real and big and amazing.”
---
He’s soooo un-hype and lame and people worship him
---
Ugh 66 months of classic, that's a lot of money from naxx runs being sold.
---
I think it is way too early to start market predictions....
---
Right it would be a sight to behold.. Other classes would be so jealous!
---
Downvote this threads please
---
Yeah it hurts. I’d like a bit of time to refresh before the chaos begins launch day. Best of luck to you
---
I have everything on MOMs, but pointing is slow and imprecise in pvp. Plus I’m constantly battling my cursor awareness to make sure I’m not accidentally hovering over an avatar or nameplate. It’s a lot to manage lol
---
Glad you could make it, Uther.
---
Here’s just an example.

&lt;FEAR WARD YOURSELF&gt;
---
This is why lazily written Auto-Moderation bots suck ass.
---
@ Moderators:  
---
There are NLP libraries out there, available for free, that would enable you to create Moderator bots, which take into account the CONTEXT a word occurs in. Just saying.
---
&gt;n on leveling an alt with gold funneled to them and I’m thinking warrior or rogue because I can keep up their gear. Any other options sound goo
---
I think that's a solid plan if you're looking to level a melee char after getting a caster to 60. Mage is great for farming lower level mats/instances as well if you're looking to get BOE gear for rogue/warrior etc. Also helps that mage is very nice to level all around.
---
Apparently most guilds will always give the bindings to MT. However if the loot system is how it was in classic then I'm literally going to blacklist myself from 2 guilds. Cos I'm ninjaing that binding XD lifes to short. If I can take it while people are squabbling, I will.
---
It was still three times as easy...you grinded your ass off?
---
In Vanilla, you would grind three times as hard.
---
I typically use Cheetah about 70% of the time when grinding mobs, assuming the mobs are dying quickly.   The extra DPS from hawk is a smaller factor than being able to loot faster, and move to the next target faster, especially before getting a mount.  That being said, if I'm fighting in densely packed groups of mobs or very hard to kill mobs, hawk all the way.  I also recommend getting run speed enchant on your boots.  Makes the speed penalty for using hawk less of a factor.
---
Well it's either loot inflation or no new content ever which in my opinion would result in the game dying.
---
And I disagree that it's the same as timewalking.. timewalking gave you bad loot that nobody needed, timewalking also was based on old content, not newly made
---
I'll say it at the last minute.. I just hope they understand though :(
---
I am going to play a priest... I just don’t know if it will be human or undead. I’m going to be super casual so not worried about endgame or pvp... I already did that.
---
Wanting to play horde 
---
I want to very much do a Druid , from pservers I was known as “chickfila “ and then made a mage that I loved named “kekfila “
---
Not sure if chickfila will be okay but maybe I can make it shiftfila 
---
I know I’m going to level both of these, but I’m not sure if I’m going to love leveling a mage without plenty of early gear ...
---
Also it’s the feeling of what professions. I really want to be an herbalist on one of these, especially the mage because of black lotus in altarac valley, and I’m considering enchanting on my Druid....
---
Server restart time has nothing to do with it, you'll be starting 11pm Tuesday :)
---
It's a global release which means everywhere launches at the same time. For US it's actually the 26th in the afternoon. For EU, its early in the morning on the 27th. It's a 3pm release for West Coast US, which I think means 1am for you in UTC+1.
---
Yeah definitely.  Just saying that their relative value will change compared to various patterns or recipes and what other content is available.  It'll also vary widely by server- depending on how active the raiding community is.
---
Here’s an example 
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10570
---
[Here's the official info graphic for release times.
---
](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/ui/UI5GHS0013QD1557845843113.jpg) 
---
That should clear up some of the confusion. 
---
So, for example for someone in Germany, Classic will launch one minute after August 26, 23:59.
---
AH! Okay.
---
I'm hoping to meet some new boys and start some new adventures
---
Do you get rested bonus before level 10 in Classic?
---
Think how good classic would be after getting reforged with BFA textures and terrain like these previews for the next patch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS1h-xA7YW4&amp;t=8m10s
---
WoW is such a simple-minded game why should anyone have to play 12 hours a day/96 hours a week to get good gear. all this post sounds like is that you are upset that other people have gear.
---
Agility and Strength, acquired from Gear, increases base Melee Attack Power.
---
I just tested this, with full gear on, at \~700 Attack Power, I gained 150 Attack Power.
---
With no gear on, at 310 Attack Power, I gained 77 Attack Power from Blood Fury
---
So 15 year memory, but I think the spec people would go for the tank group warlock was affliction.  I think 31/5/15.  They would give up ruin and pick up dark pact.  
---
Even though they are specced affliction they only multidot on trash or outside of the raid otherwise they would just keep shadowbolting.  
---
If you go full demo with imp you get +fire damage, which is useless, so I don't think there is every a pve reason to go full demo.
---
I've been listening to the recently released audiobook for Arthas and it's soooo gooooooood
---
In the Stress Test I didn't make any change but the names themselve still showed up from far away if I checked the box to show NPC names all the time. Not healthbars, but just the names (with high graphics settings as well). Can someone test this?
---
Aren’t those guys just from the esports division?
---
Sweet! Thank you! :D
---
Thanks :D Can hardly wait
---
And the fact that you would get three times as more gear as average raider in TBC vs Vanilla, somehow missed your eye?
---
Guess I made my point : TBC supporters are indeed lazy, if they can't even spend 5 minutes reading a post.
---
No wonder they want TBC...it's too damn easy to get gear, without much effort. Well, it was effort, but compared to Vanilla, it was a breeze.
---
Corruption, immolate and agony/tongues(depending on circumstances)should always be up. Drain life and Shadow bolt when possible.
---
This argument goes for literally anything in the game, change mats for consumables because people will know them in advance, change item requirements for quests etc.
---
We won't have the same feeling of war effort ever again, deal with that reality.
---
Best one was called "use the search"
---
Can't watch it at work. Any chance you can cliff notes it?
---
This must he a troll. As there is no last minute as it takes guild wide effort for multiple raids to get one
---
agreed
---
Actually, you can't, AFAIK the thing is made from brushed Aluminum by Injection moulding. Not sturdy enough.
---
Racials aren't really what I'm taking into account.
---
What worries me is if on the Horde side there will be comparably less PvE opportunities (to get groups, find a guild, etc) compared to the Alliance, given that, from my understanding and from what I've read about the experience on pservers, the Horde (generally) is more PvP orientated than the Alliance.
---
Perfect
---
..... do they not know that you can buy the same thing on amazon for like $50? Like does this have integrated power or USB pass through or anything? Or is it literally a pice of metal with some holes in it to mount a monitor?
---
Yeah, and then your guild just drop your ass and you would have useless items from Geddon or Shazzrah that you would never be able to complete.  After you get the drops, you still have about 100+ hours of farming high end content just to get what you need.  
---
You aren't play with nubs this time around that don't know what the items even are.  Only reason we ever saw Paladins and Hunters with the item before is because the bindings dropped and no one knew what they were for originally.  If they see taking a binding, they would dump you ass immediately and reform the guild.
---
Commenting on this thread so I don't lose this handy dandy information.  I had no idea this was even possible, and I plan on using this newfound ability to maintain proper diplomacy with the horde in my travels.
---
Yep.
---
Not true, we already know what wow classic is and people already played this game before so nothing new to discover like a new expansion or something and please stop with streamer did this streamer did that boycott streamers bla bla bla
---
&gt; But you still had to down those bosses.
---
And in Vanilla you didn't, bosses just came to Orgrimmar and give loot to everyone.
---
Jesus, the stupidity of TBC supporters...
---
What is request invite?
---
Just out of curiosity, what makes you think that?
---
66.6, huh?
---
Apple WoW Satanism confirmed.
---
It appears you have it figured out.
---
hahah "Stormwind" - barely shows a few seconds of a ship going by blocking most of the city.
---
I don't know if that looks good to me.  The lighting and shadows are what I'd expect from dumping models into Unreal, but the cartoon textures...
---
They went in and had modeled tree bark but then left the ship in Stormwind unbumped entirely.
---
Lol... are you serious?
---
I don't trust Blizzard further than I can throw them.
---
Yeah I'm sure all your tanks, warriors and rogues will be super understanding that you've hid the fact you plan on taking their best possible weapon that has a near impossible drop rate. Surely most of your raiders wont leave instantly when they see what an upstanding GM you are.
---
No need to start name calling, I just stated I enjoyed the TBC system more than I enjoyed the vanilla system of dealing with gear. Vanilla is better than BfA, but imo TBC is better than vanilla.
---
Give paladin a shot:
---
Easy on the hands. For leveling, it’s basically auto attacks. At 60, it’s one button healing. 
---
They’re slow but steady levelers and if you pair up with people it’s easy to clear fast, plus make friends.
---
You like tanking, and they can do it all through leveling and 5 mans.
---
You like getting easy groups, and being able to fill all 3 roles is best for that.
---
You like topping the meters, and they’re healing beasts.
---
Paladins are decent AOE farmers.
---
You think alliance is easier.
---
I would think that guilds would probably want to drag it out a little bit, actually, so they have more time to get in more Broodlord and Nefarian kills so that more of their raiders can get the scepter.
---
I think just the ring. I want to say it gave a little xp every time but probably faster to vendor them all next time and kill two extra mobs honestly
---
Then to me druid is the clear choice
---
You need to be master looter of the raid, ninja it. Switch to a new server. Build up reputation enough to find yourself in master looter position again, even as pug. Ninja loot again. Farm up your mats in silence and get a paid name change in your silence. Find a group getting their TF and join it. Trick everyone into believing it was a glitch as they kill it a second time. Get a second server transfer and show off.
---
This work on NA servers too?
---
man i know. i watch streamers on DOTA 2 and i've never been annoyed by a streamer before until i started watching WoW streams. it's just bad. 
---
and nobody is allowed to criticize him without a bunch of redditors showing up to defend him "OHHH you just have no life why do you care so much about streamers that's not really what Asmon's personality is like that's just an act he puts on for 13 hours everyday on Twitch"
---
&gt;which in my opinion would result in the game dying.
---
The game has been played by an active community numbering in the 100.000s for TWELVE YEARS, without any changes to the content.
---
So forgive me for not putting a lot of trust in your opinion in this regard.
---
Yep. I'm just trying to min-max my troll gank ability if you know what I mean. I want to be the notorious troll ganker that haunts the unsuspecting allies 😀
---
All they need to do is add the damn post-processing effects they use in their "in-game-engine cinematics"
---
Their mounting system is proprietary which is why an adapter is required to use VESA mounts.
---
Already done.
---
The apple stand can flip... flip the cost of the apple stand upside down... mind blown
---
ZUG ZUG!
---
So many people got trolled into actually replying to this thread lol.
---
fuuuuuuuuuck haha i've been checking my email so frequently as well....ugh. thanks though!
---
"I kill him every week!"
---
*immersion intensifies*
---
Normal vs Hard difficulty, obviously.
---
Completely depends on how good your 1H/Shield is compared to your regular 2H. Like, putting a 10-level outdated green 1H and a grey shield over your blue 2H is probably worse.
---
A reasonable shield grants \~15% damage reduction (armor, actual block is completely irrelevant without specialized gear), which is pretty good, and some nice TPS via more Revenge procs.
---
That's interesting.  I bet gamers are the precursor measurement to gen pop.
---
so one guild can start it kinda defeats the purpose and screwing over smaller guilds
---
I get your point, however /u/pastagains is specifically talking about the AQ War Effort. The Scarab Lord quest line will probably be unlocked only when the War Effort begins, but if people know beforehand what they need to farm  it will give you far less time to try and finish the Scarab Lord quest, obtain all the scepters and hit the gong within 10 hours of the first hit. 
---
The issue is that they can't change what you need to collect for the War effort as you had to pretty much donate almost the entirety of the item pool ranging from copper to thorium bars. They can only change the quantity.
---
Unpopular opinion: The stream makes it more hype for many because people are now eager to login and experience or go to the places the streamers went or try to do the same things they did. As an example, when I first started to play WoW I did not get past level 40 for the first 2 months but I did watch a ton of videos on the game mainly World of Roguecraft. As you may know already, WoR was filmed mostly in EPL and WPL. Even though I had not been to these zones yet but had them spoiled, it added to the depth and mystery of how massive the game was and how much more I still had to go. Sadly, by the time I got to those zones they were old news and not many people as 60 went to these places as much as they once did because AQ 40 had just released and everyone was in Silithus instead farming AQ rep. Nothing was more cool though than seeing this undead wasteland in the game full of mushrooms and ruined cities. It actually made me want to play the game more because I was very excited to get the chance to experience it for myself.
---
Why would they care about that? There’s going to be at least ONE guild who only want its main tank / guild leader to be Scarab Lord, and they’re going to fuck over every other guild by banging the gong early. The drama is going to be delicious.
---
They're all streamers. Didn't you know only streamers got invited to the beta / stress test??
---
/S
---
You answered your own question.
---
I'm sorry.
---
Not every story needs to be topped off with an "evil mastermind" who is powerful enough to single-handedly take on an entire army by himself. Not every story needs to end with a giant monster or uber-powerful dark lord. Think about Star Wars - would Star Wars be better if Luke Skywalker had to organize a 40 man raid to confront Darth Vader? No. If Star Wars was a game, the raid part would be on Endor, fitting into the lore of the world and being important without necessarily being the pivotal hinge upon which the entirety of the story hangs, whereas the rich story culmination moment would be a personal scenario. 
---
That isn't to say taking down a big important dude can't be fun - there are a number of raid boss fights I've enjoyed over the years, but I would be lying if I didn't think it was disappointing how the climax of The Burning Crusade was something I never saw. Naxx was a different story - I never felt missing Naxx was a big deal because it was really just a place you raided and while killing KT may be somewhat important, he was largely just a powerful Lich rather than someone whom vast amounts of lore sat. The Naxx approach is almost exactly what I'm talking about works well - it fits into the lore, but if you didn't raid Naxx... no big deal. It's just a raid, the extent of story progression was "Ashbringer is corrupted and can't be restored, you have to make a new Ashbringer" (which I believe got retconned anyways).
---
I mean MC is the easiest raid in the game, any guild that isn't total trash will be clearing it if that's what you mean by 'farming legendaries'. It's just that bindings are a very low drop rate, I've cleared MC over 100 times in the last two years and have yet to see a single binding drop.
---
this doesnt go for anything in the game as the war effort was kept under wraps by blizz for as long as possible.
---
Its always been easy to get a list of crafting materials before hand
---
My SO is leaving for a week and then another 3 day weekend. In June and July..
---
Thank you! :)
---
Man this topic is so tired. No one is making you watch. If you do and you're getting burned out from watching the game, maybe you don't want to play it as much as you think you do. I'm also confused as to why this subreddit thinks "don't let them stream x" is even possible. Unless they issue a DMCA, then they can't stop someone from streaming something. This is not vanilla WoW, it was never going to be. It's a different game in a different time. The experience you're chasing is not going to happen. Just play the game and have fun.
---
all it takes is 1 guild to ruin it tho. or one streamer
---
I’m aware that this is 100% my opinion, but I cannot stand looking at that ugly ass Tauren cat form. The night elf one looks so sleek.
---
&gt;It will be easier to gear up. That doesn’t mean it rewards laziness though
---
The laziness part was about badge and rep gear, not about raiding gear.
---
The raiding gear part was about how much gear could a 25 man raid get in one week, vs a 40 man raid in a week in Vanilla.
---
And it is damn obvious that it was THREE TIMES as more gear in TBC, per raider.
---
Simple math...not rocket science.
---
And the POINT I am making is clear : the START of the gaming design "give gear to everyone" mentality started in TBC. There are no ifs and buts here...TBC was the start, and that makes TBC anti-Vanilla, not a continuation of Vanilla.
---
Add all the other crap (flying mounts, dailies, resilience, class balance around arena comp) and TBC was not an expansion of Vanilla : it was the first dagger in the soul of Vanilla...followed by Wrath, Cata, MoP, and so on.
---
cartoony doesn't mean exaggerated.
---
Go for it. Can't wait to read the realm forum post about it.
---
While one person uses an addon that appears to give them an advantage, another person using the same addon may not get any benefit from it at all. One of the all time best healers I played with from Vanilla to Cataclysm refused to use any mods at all (Oot you and your alts have not been forgotten). Addons will not make a mediocre player a beast topping the charts, and not using addons will not make a good player subpar. Being the best you can be comes from knowing your class, understanding your talents and skills, and preparing for the scenarios you plan to encounter. If a player isn't willing to put in the effort an addon won't change it.
---
kind of unrelated: did they fix the issues with ~~pets~~ becoming depressed after every bg?
---
FTFY
---
Me in vanilla walking around with Zin'rokh as a huntard. Not as crazy as TF but I got /spit on a lot
---
Yeah I get that. Just blows my mid someone would still buy it even though you can buy the same thing for 1/20th the cost lol.
---
And why exactly would any guild put in an enormeous amount of effort, and sacrifice a huuuge amount of resources just to try to limit the amount of people who can get their hands on a Title and mount, neither of which have any technical impact on the game?
---
You can tell that not only does feedback and bug reports work, but they clearly pay close attention to the subreddit aswell. Nothing but respect to team working there.
---
Unless I’m thinking of something else, I’m pretty sure Kologarn also had a hard mode, depending on the order of his limbs you broke
---
It's all a matter of preference. I, personally, loved the Silverpine-&gt;Tarren Mill route. Less competition for mobs, and slightly smaller area so not as much running was required. Plus, the aesthetic fits well if you are an undead fan.
---
It was good, but the end was dissatisfying. They added a little bit to it in TBC, but it was still left open ended.
---
Your experience is anecdotal, it won’t be the experience for a majority of hunters. And if your guild officers don’t know how to recruit a diverse team, they shouldn’t run a guild.
---
Even back when I wasn't tryharding, these things dropped off quick.
---
You need to acquire so much stuff beyond what you get from the related gathering profession, that it's just too inefficient for me.
---
Power to those who want to do it, but these days I know I'd rather just reap the rewards of a long-term gold-efficient profession set up.  For me, that means double gathering up to 60 on the first couple toons, and then reassess based on market.
---
Thanks for pointing that out, was half asleep when I wrote it
---
Freaking genius.
---
No changes! /s
---
But not really. I mean to change the regeants won't make that much more of an improvement, people know where to farm and how to find resources for better areas, compared to Vanilla I would think.
---
Cuz it has been done on pservers, i think some did it in under 2 weeks.
---
I think blizz intended for the event be to be huge and drawn out
---
First of all, this should be posted in /r/classicwowplus
---
Secondly, IMO, if there is 'different gear', one set will inherently be better than another and that is the set that'd be used.
---
Sounds miserable. Godspeed friend.
---
I raid on private servers as powershifting. The DPS over standard kitty is significant and I haven't had a ton of mana issues. For long fights, it becomes hard to keep up but I was slacking on some food buffs (+mp/5) and some demonic runes.
---
I'm not familiar with that one, do you have a link?
---
I was speaking in general terms, not personal experience of some players.
---
maybe you should try it sometimes.
---
Exceptions and personal experience are irrelevant...unless EVERYONE who played TBC was working 12 hrs/day and has a 3 year old toddler, like you did.
---
Golden hour in mulgor!
---
They're exactly how they were in 2004. People remember them being harder because everyone was terrible at the game with bad computers and connections. Private servers have been making instances harder for years.
---
They are all too busy playing the beta D:
---
That isn't specific to Blizzard it's happening to the entire gaming industry.
---
Reasons:
---
* The entire gaming industry is dealing with the same problem that is clobbering consumer tech: Market saturation
---
* US-based companies also have to deal with the fallout from the Orange Twitter addicts temper tantrums.
---
Because if your guild is the only guild on server that has a person with that mount, both your guild &amp; that person will feel much more entitled/prestigious.
---
Not trying to be a dick, but I've personally seen this question asked soooo many times over the past few weeks. Instead of having the community answer the same thing over and over again you could probably google this answer very easily
---
exactly what i meant :P
---
its a bird! its a plane! no, its another post saying the same thing nobody asked for
---
no changes is an effort to presever what wow classic was, an adjustment to a resource list in an effort to preserve the intended experience fo the AQ War Effort is not a change.
---
you can't buy your own auctions on the same account, even on a server where your allowed to play on both factions.
---
You would need to give your friend the money and they would have to buyout  the auciton for you. (or have another account)
---
Oh, I wanted to have TBC...but what does this have to come at the expense of 1.13?
---
Why get TBC over 1.13? Why not get both?
---
I never thought of that.
---
Although in the case of cloth you can probably close the gap by making bandages.  Iirc silk cloth is worth 2s each when sold as heavy bandages.
---
Why would you not want to manage your threat? You can't really do that without KTM.
---
The strafe animation issue is that the character would turn and run sideways when strafing if you had a target selected.  So you might want to also check how strafing looks when targeting a hostile mob.  (Thanks for making a gif to test it out!)
---
As long as Omar doesn't quit, I have hope.
---
End of thread
---
Its less about making it harder to farm, and more about not knowing in advance. As it is, a guild can realistically spend the months before the release to just farm enough to entirely finish the whole thing - but if they dont know what mats will be used, sure, they can be farmed but they can't be easily "pre-farmed".
---
I think the only path forward past Naxxrammas is to make the raids legitimately dangerous. As in you don't get prizes by killing these raids. You get to keep Orgrimar not a smoldering ruin. I think the problem with raiding is that people expect prizes. When I think the biggest prize should be saving the realm.
---
I’ve played on a private server once where everyone could use GM commands to add items to your inventory. I dual wielded Thunderfury. It looked fucking badass when sheathed onto your back.
---
But no, you can’t do it in the real game. Closest you can get is playing rogue in BfA and getting the artifact skin.
---
Its scarey and bonkers tbh. DId you know the average Millennial checks their phone and facebook before they leave bed in the morning.  In the younger group, cell phone battery life is directly related to increase in panic attacks.
---
kayden kross plays wow??
---
Well it seems like it is way easier than we all remember.
---
It has been validated that some boss deals the correct amount of domage. But I'm not quite sure all mobs hit normal, YET.
---
I think it is just a wait and see situation
---
You sound like main tank material
---
And you don’t according to many others that actually played Vanilla, including ShadowPanther.
---
xD "accidentally"
---
For old times sake!
---
theyre the same as they were before, blizzard has a working vanilla client from 2006 to fact check everything on, so if its wrong itll be fixed. its just mainly people remembering things wrong or things based on private servers which had inaccurate mob values
---
xD
---
When Classic WoW starts making them millions and millions of dollars every month for relatively little work, I think they're gonna ensure it's well maintained.
---
Tereith?
---
Don't play with them if you don't want to, just don't expect others to take you without DBM if you're making mistakes.
---
I'm sure it would be way too much work to be worthwhile for their (probably) small team, but I'd love to see a list of the fixes they are implementing.
---
I don't personally enjoy or see the point of playing on launch day.  The bottlenecking and the potential full queue times doesn't appeal to me.  It's not like the game is going anywhere.  Missing one or two of the first days won't change anything.  I'm not in it for the realm firsts, so I'm good on letting the rush madness go through.
---
Yes some gear might be better in some situations than others but it wouldn't result in steadily more and more powerful gear over time.
---
You can play without.
---
This makes me sad
---
idk if i responded to you already but hardcore guilds can be jerks in there hunt for server/world firsts
---
4 trolls 1 orc
---
I wouldn’t call LMGD one of the best rogue levelers just because he made a video with TipsOut. And you don’t according to many others that actually played Vanilla, including ShadowPanther.
---
Obviously I don't know anything about that :D
---
'They could be complete asshats for all I know. I just can't see any ads or links to things they're promoting about themselves, so either they're somehow selling traffic metadata or they're not making money.
---
NGL I didn't care for these graphics too much, mainly the horde zones. Orgrimmar / Razor Hill were almost unrecognizable and Tirisfal Glades was way too bright. Alliance zones looked nice though and that fire elemental in the stockade was really clean.
---
Well i think it‘s kinda hard to determin for lvl 30 without mounts, if you run straight into someone on a mount as warrior you still could jump/dismount/charge. Without that rule a warrior has not a good chance of getting sticky to a hunter in a duel as he only has intercept then. 
---
Coming back to hunters, no pre trap also seemed wired for me as on nearly every scenario a hunter is already set in bg/arena with a trap (at least from a tbc standpoint) and awaiting opponents. I think a „playground“ with a single pillar or 4 pillars like nagrand arena would have been way nicer and you could throw off all the „benefiting“ rules. Afterall 1v1 in classic, especially on lower levels is not balanced at all, and never was meant to be.
---
Razorscale, igneous, Kologarn, and the Huntress boss have no hard mode, I'm certain of that. A quick google also confirms that. 
---
You were probably just doing the fight wrong. I think he does massive raid-wide damage if you kill both arms at the same time, something like that. You just weren't supposed to do that.
---
No, that's how they were in 2006 - patch 1.12.  Private servers ran off of 1.12 also.  Private servers were already stupidly easy.  That makes Classic ....
---
A nice, comfy chair, a neck pillow, a wrist-supporting glove, and a raid bucket.
---
As much as possible, but I'm getting older and it's going to launch a few hours after I get out of work. Gonna try to take a power nap and aim for 12-18.
---
I wouldn't go for straight Cadaverous Garb personally. It has great Stamina and Attack Power, but lacks big time in Agility, crit, and only gives you a slight bit of hit % for wearing 5 pieces.  
---
Devilsaur Set is fantastic, for just 2 pieces you get 2% hit, 2% crit, and nice AP/Stam. Then you can fill in the other pieces as you see fit.
---
How come none of these work? https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-guides/196730-guide-talking-cross-faction-limited-phrases.html
---
I attempted doing this as a priest with tailoring. Its hard as fuck, you always end up a few levels ahead of what your making unless you spend some $$$ on the AH, which is not ideal if you are penny pinching to grab your mount at 40. 
---
Maybe I just wasn't farming enough, but I figured next time around Il wait till after 40 to level up my Tailoring. I thinking about picking up Herb/mining first thing tho.
---
TBC is inevitable if Classic succeeds
---
Classic literally is 1.13
---
Any other template responses I'm missing or can we move on now for the 16th time today
---
I can easily imagine that tbh. People are complaining about the tiniest details because nO ChAnGeS
---
This type of stuff sounds interesting to me as well.. the reward doesn't necessarily have to be loot all the time.
---
youre gonna want one of these [https://imgur.com/a/Fk2Oh0q](https://imgur.com/a/Fk2Oh0q)
---
Honestly it's so unlikely for something like this to happen that if it was actually realistic I'd say it would've happened on a pserver, but yet no such thing has ever been close to attempted on a pserver, so based on that I just think it's entirely unrealistic to think anyone cares that much about the event to invest time/gold to pull something like this off
---
Mages are the master class.  I played one for 5-6 years.
---
Portals are huge.  Each expansion they got less and less profitable, i.e. people paying 1g in vanilla didn't want to pay 5g in BC or 10g in wrath.  I'd say they were most profitable in vanilla.  Lack of travel options in Vanilla also puts portals in higher demand (only 1 hearthstone on 60 min. CD, no city hub like Dalaran to port into for city options, no flying).  So insane travel and class money making.
---
Other then that, they are super viable across the board.  PVE top DPS contenders, PVP frost can be dirty.  You have CC and movement abilities to solo/kite high end stuff.  In Cata I was able to solo farm Firelands trash.  Speaking of farming, AOE farming is baller in some areas of the game.
---
Gear at times has been sweet.  Depending on the game meta, only Warlock and Priest to share gear with.  Most of the time, those classes are DoT dependent so not taking crit strike gear.    I forget the rules and what not on stat modifiers, but typically if there was a divide in cloth gear, mages were in their own group from Spriests and warlocks. 
---
Can't bring myself to play the same class due to the time I've already spent.  Always despised rogues and they seem like a cool counterpart.  No portals but I guess I can pick locks and stealth gank people.
---
It's running off of patch 1.12.  It all really depends on when you started.  I can't speak for mid level dungeons, as I power gamed everything, but high level content was definitely castrated.
---
The game seemed harder then because a lot of us were new to mmos and all of us were new to wow, not to mention we were most likely terrible.
---
Hes literally a scammer.
---
Prior to jumping on the classic wow bandwagon he worked for a construction company and committed around $800,000 worth of Fraud.
---
Constantly chats easily disprovable shit.
---
Just... not a great guy.
---
Light’s Hope
---
&gt; Nothing wrong with allowing everyone the ability to progress their character and not gatekeep it to only those who can devote the most time possible to playing. 
---
This type of mentality is the one that led to WoD, Legion and BfA.
---
A real MMORPG needs to have disparity in power between players, if not, it becomes a casino roulette, where EVERYONE have to be almost equally geared.
---
Just look at last 3 expansions of WoW, and the impact in the sub numbers.
---
That is what EASE of access is doing to a game...and it started in TBC.
---
Destroyed? No. All I see is a kid that can barely string a sentence together that made no good arguments or comebacks and instead resorted to petty insults and memes.
---
All the fights you mentioned do have a hardmode. Razorscale flame breaths along with Igneous.
---
It made fights more challenging and you got gear from those, no?
---
Indeed, you could on pve realms.
---
Wow mate, you got downvoted into oblivion. I just took a look at a model comparison video (it did not have running and walking comparisons) and the new modela look good enough. I think people just want static unmoving faces and #nochanges. WC3 was cartoony and the new facial animations go back to that.
---
Not sure, I think people don't like him because iirc he lies. The word on the street is he claims to have played back in classic nowadays, but in the past said he started in WotLK or something. 
---
Actually can someone post the evidence right here right now of this, or I'm going to consider it just shit talk. 
---
Personally I don't enjoy his personality a lot I think there are a lot of better classic people and tips just aggregates others knowledge in one place.
---
whatever, I'm going with this build. I like it better. You can sit here and call people "dumb" or just let them answer my question and not care. It's not rocket science and no argument is ment to be had
---
Especially when it's all in September!
---
&gt;To set the scene: My Parents and Sister had taken off on Holidays, I told them I couldn't get the time off work to go with them,  I did get the time off but Burning Crusade was just released and there was no way I was going to miss that.

He literally posted it was not...

" To set the scene: My Parents and Sister had taken off on Holidays, I told them I couldn't get the time off work to go with them, I did get the time off but Burning Crusade was just released and there was no way I was going to miss that. "

Yeah that was my biggest problem with it, instead of it being a pure hd upgrade they went full redesign.
---
God damn it, now I have to spend time putting spaces in the navy seal copy pasta when I get home.

Youd go oom and no way you out dps rogue hunter mage or warrior. Or you played with bad players

&gt;TBC was the first Dagger in the soul of Vanilla
---
Well it’s a good thing we still get to keep Vanilla this time around, if/when we get BC. Neither of us are arguing that you don’t get *more* drops in BC. I’m arguing that some see that as a positive, not a negative.
---
I also remeber a mage duel at the start where in my opinion the mage intentionally drages the fight into length for an extra evocation, and winning the duel then just cause of poly. And the rules prohibted such behaviour. I think the toruney judges were not aware of their own rules.
---
I still haven’t forgiven them for the female nelfs and human faces.

The took away my red Tauren druid too, she’s brown now. : /

I don't think Arthas took Uther's soul. Otherwise I question why he wouldn't have raised him as a Death Knight. I'm fairly certain Uther pulled an "Obiwan" on him.

First time gives 1100 at 31. (Ran this in beta last night) Also, as of Beta AH prices, the 3 sil to run the machine is MUCH more then the value of any thing, including Small Lustrous Pearls.

When I was in high school my whole family left for a week and I stayed at home. 2 of my friends brought over their computers and we set the dining room table up in front of my couch and had a 4 day wow lan during TBC. The best of times.
---
As i remember you can have only one legendary item of each type. So the answer is no.
---
Although it would be funny to watch them clear MC with 10 people.  1.12 is so dumb.
---
I'm waiting...

---
Definitely a banner for your chosen faction! That would be a good place to start. I’m currently building a room inside my standalone garage, my plans are to decorate the interior with the colours of the horde, get myself some nice banners build a shelf to put my various world of Warcraft collectables on and stock the bar fridge with various period correct junk food, all in time for classic release.
---
First, Heroic farming wasnt 'easy' unless you had a good group of raiders. Pugging heroics was harder than now, no lfg tool and some heroics needed CC (the final pull of Shattered halls need 2 CC). I think the daily that gave bonus badges was not implemented for a few patches . 
---
Second, T4 wasnt that great for all. Many classes/specs used Blues into T6 (I know i raided shadow priest well into BC with a +shadow damage green cloak). Badges didnt drop from raids until 2.3.
---
Zul' Aman (2.3) offered gear as good as T5 while being a much easier raid (the bear race was a challenge)
---
Badge gear became bad with 2.4  (Shattered Sun Offensive) as the quality of gear availiable became much higher.
---
TLDNR - Badge farming only became a problem around 2.4
---
Stoke me a clipper.
---
You'll never waste time finding a group.  I'm considering a holy priest or prot warrior for that very reason.
---
All the LFG haters forget how time consuming finding a group was for DPS.  You might spend an hour forming a group, only for the healer or tank to just jump ship before you find the other one.
---
To start, right up a system that can toss hot pockets into a microwave then dump them to a tray, then a conveyer belt or dumbwaiter to transport them up to your room, keep some paper towels, lotion, and a fridge up there to keep your drinks cool, buy a fancy toilet/gaming chair combo and dump out the window when necessary, get a triple deadbolt lock on the door installed, insulate and pad the walls to prevent noise from entering or escaping, get an adjustable height desk to sit it low so you can lower your chair/lean back and play comfortably, and otherwise keep DoorDash ready so you can order food if you're not feeling hot pockets, set up a decent cot so you have somewhere to power nap, and write a will just in case you die of heart failure due to sleep deprivation. Don't you dare ever leave that room. Don't forget to keep a backup of canned goods and room temp sodas in the room outside of the fridge, in case things get really bad. Dry shampoo is good, along with sponge baths. I think that mostly covers it.
---
100%, the discussion was strangely focused on banning vs teleporting the offenders away which was a perfectly tempered response.

It's a matter of whatever is your best weapon at the time, but the ability to use 2h axes/maces is actually a level 20 talent, and at level 20 you'll probably have the crescent staff from WC which is amazing and won't be replaced until the mid 20s.  If your next weapon happens to be a really good mace/axe then you'll want to swap over for a bit.  Just be open to the fact that staves can be really good and keep your eyes open for them.
---
Currently watching it with my S/O and trying to get her interested in WoW lol
---
You'll find a lot of addons on willitclassic.com
---
Situations like that are exactly why I play a druid - and why I will never top meters. I love helping and being the "oh shit" button of the group. I know my DPS and healing will never be #1, but if I can help our group/raid I am more than happy! The class isn't supposed to be pigeonholed into one role and I wish more people could see that.
---
I feel like the Max Distance is like 3m. I had to enable NPC Names just to see Enemies from a Distance.

Leatherworking allows your character to create armor kits that permanently add stats to leather gear.
---
Did I actually say that or can you not read?
---
I only level my Tauren to like 25 but it really loved the zones.
---
Those assumptions really start to bother me. They could be fliped vice versa and the assumption could be now: will there be more players due to streamers?

Just wait those 2 1/2 months and we will see.
---
Auriel is my girl.
---
That’s not that bad.
---
Yeah Ulduar was awesome. I didn't have a lot of raid experience but I was always awestruck going in there every week. I definitely remember doing hard mode on the boss with the heart but everything. I think we cleared most of it, but I stopped playing before my guild killed Yogg. I always regret not getting to experience all of Ulduar.
---
Bro, Wrath wasn’t near as disappointing as TBC imo for that. 
---
Kael’Thas gets more screen time than any other character in WC3 TFT. He gets killed off unceremoniously.
---
Vasj is an ally to Kael’Thas, and by extension the player, when his other allies are abandoning him. Gets killed off unceremoniously.
---
The Draenei? Not even remotely similar to what they were in WC3.
---
And of course Illidan. One of the more nuanced characters in warcraft. Is he good? Is he bad? Does his love of his family redeem his willingness to make pacts with demons? What about when those pacts with demons result in him being the last line of defence against a greater evil? ...At least there’s a decent bit of buildup before killing him I guess.
---
People used addons in Vanilla.  More of them, arguably, and they did way more for you.
---
There is still a power disparity between players even in retail. 
---
Nothing wrong with allowing everyone to progress their character. People who put in 2-3 hours a day or less still have less gear than those who devote 5+ hours a day.
---
No mmo will last if people run into a progression wall based on hours they can put in.
---
Did someone say...
---
Odd you say Korean here, considering a Korean mmo has the most beautiful, indepth mountain ranges and landscapes in the industry
---
This is one of the best quest chains in WoW. It's just a shame they never finished it
---
The RNG aspect of gear dropping is irrelevant, and really hard to count for.
---
What matter is that the average raider in TBC, that DID NOT set foot in BT and Sunwell, would get THREE TIMES as more gear compared to the average raider in Vanilla, that didn't set foot in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
We are talking about majorities here, not guild "X" or player "Y".
---
TBC provided three times as much gear for the average raider, in raids that were EASY for both : Ony, MC and BWL for Vanilla, and Kara, ZA, SSC, Gruul, Maghteridon, TK and Hyjal for TBC.
---
There is no getting around math...and looking at the downvotes, man, TBC babies really don't like math...
---
Yo these animations are amazing. I'd taxi everywhere if i got to see this show every time.
---
That is concerning...the only thing I can think of (to make sense of this) is that the ghost of Uther, is not his ghost, but rather the Light portraying an image of Uther for him, since he cannot.
---
I heard that 87% of statistics on reddit are made up :)

Ya I wasn't a fan of the difficulties either. The fanbase doesn't seem to like it, or there wouldn't be a huge push for vanilla.
---
Hello all!  
---
Currently looking for my main between Priest, Rogue, Mage. A bit of background first:
---
I have 10 friends coming back for classic and the breakdown is:  3 Holy/Disc Priests, 3 Warriors, 2 Warlocks, 1 Mage and 1 Resto Shaman. 0 Rogues, Druids, or Hunters.   My leveling partner is going to be one of the warlocks but we’ll all group together in various ways. 
---
**Priest:** I was set on Priest until I learned 3 other friends had the same idea. I do expect the other 3 will heal along with the Shaman, leaving me to focus on Shadow which is what I'd really want. Our raid leader would save the token shadow priest spot for me and I’d have a blast in PvP. Leveling would be quick and efficient as a shadow priest along with my warlock friend. The option to heal 5 mans or totally re-spec holy or disc at 60 is very much an option too. This class has a lot to offer with unique spells like mind control.
---
Only negative of priest is that 6 of my other friends are clothies and I would be the 7th. Tons of competition in dungeons for cloth gear and Shadow damage gear with the lock when leveling.  **Bonus points that my gut still says play priest at the end of the day**
---
**Rogue:** Rogue seems to be an obvious choice given the breakdown of my friends are playing. I’d be the only melee dps, only leather wearer aside from the resto shaman, and I love the class fantasy of Rogues. Always kept one as an alt but never a main. My only fear is that there are too many rogues outside our group and Rogues don’t add a ton of utility to groups aside from damage.   **Bonus points for being the only Rogue main of my friends**
---
**Mage:** As mentioned above, Mage has been my main since MoP and I’ve really enjoyed it. I know what I’m doing in frost PvP and feel I’d have a lot of success. Always wanted to see what my Mage would’ve been like had I picked one in classic. Bonus points for not having to respec as frequently between pvp and pve, portals, food/water, etc… Negatives are basically the same as Priest and Rogue – there are lots of mages out there and I’d be competing heavily for gear in every 5 man.  **Bonus points for having 7 years of PvP experience on the class.**
---
Thanks everyone!
---
That spreadsheet is amazing.  I hope blizzard sees it.  My only gripe would be that some of those visual bugs categorized as 'small' are actually pretty major to the feel of the game.
---
Probably a Rogue. They don't really need much in the way of gear to be effective. Check out Mute's [World of Roguecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw) for an idea. Obviously, the more gear you have the easier your life will be, but Rogues should be able to lock people down regardless.
---
My axe in their skull is the only foreign relations I'm interested in.
---
I think DDO did it proper.. if you're not doing the content, you don't need the gear that comes from said content.
---
Yo, since you have beta, would you mind checking for me if cloth rep turn in is available?
---
it will be interesting how the beta unfolds over the next couple months and how Bliz goes about it.
---
You're right, updated. Though I'd bet the 2004 versions would still be a cake walk today.
---
Classic is going to be hilariously easy for anyone that's played a good amount of the game. The difficulty shouldn't be what draws you in.
---
He may have convinced arthas to go back and rally forces with the king if he helped him purge strathome.
---
This, unless your in a guild that's top 10 contention....it won't matter.
---
And those guilds and tight nit bleeding edge players are already in a guild together.  Good luck with that application process.
---
I'd say racial is marginal decision depending on preference of PVP or PVE.   Like whether to go Orc Rogue for PVE (dps cooldown) and Undead Rogue for PVP (fear resist).  I primarily PVE and rarely PVP, but still might go Rogue just because it's fun.
---
Deadmines also had a hard mode. You just pull two packs everytime and don’t use CC.
---
You can make anything harder for yourself in WoW. But if we’re talking mechanical hardmodes that Blizzard put in, then no Kologarn didn’t have one.

---
Yeah, I really only plan on doing deadmines, stocks, ZF, and sunken temple while leveling up.
---
Where was I complaining? I don't like A so I'm doing B
---
Lmao, gonna need a source for that one boss.
---
Flame Leviathan - towers gave boss more abilities
---
XT - killing heart sent him back to full HP and flew into a rage AE'ing the hard super hard.
---
Iron Council - different boss order meant challenging later phases.
---
Hodir - not really a hard mode, just a timed kill. 
---
Freya - I think you had to leave her adds up? I'm forgetful of this.
---
Thorim - you had to fight an extra dude (his wife I think?)
---
Mecha-Gnome - big red button, everyone knows this. 
---
General Vezaxx - you have to not destroy his mana-sucking balls and it creates an avatar you have to kill.
---
Yogg - never did this hard mode, but you have to forsake every abilities 
---
Not every boss had a hard mode. Only those did.
---
If people can just look it all up then why were there 100k people watching Deadmines?
---
Before TBC, addons could do just about anything, even during combat. They could cast spells based on logic conditionals, change your hotkeys, and some other pretty silly things.
---
This meant the addons could take the information, make a decision based upon it, and act on it. And all you really had to do was keep pressing a button every global cooldown (1.5 seconds).
---
Healers would always pick the right target and cast the most efficient spell rank based on missing HP and current mana regen. And also whether someone else was already healing the target.
---
DPS and Tanks could just press one button knowing their rotation was perfectly optimized.
---
It never got quite that bad for an entire raid, but it was starting to, so Blizzard made a lot of things addons could do “protected” while in combat.

I'll try it out for sure. If it nets even 10g/hour at 40 it's not too bad. 
---
But preferably I'd like to grind my last levels in a way that gets me to 100g at 40. Found that snapjaws in alterac or shimmering flats is a pretty good way.
---
If you take the first binding, you won't have a guild left to get the second one you need for thunderfury.
---
That's it? Seems like a waste of a profession slot if armor kits are the best it's got.
---
Honestly, SL is only really a dueling spec
---
Good to know. In that case there may have been something else at play. Maybe glitchy flight paths or some sort of design decision to streamline the flights. Either way glad to see these flight designs back in. I forgot how much I missed them.
---
A CM is the mouthpiece for the company. A developer is not. Business decisions don’t get made with either in the room, but after the decision gets made, it’s the CM that tells everyone.
---
In no world that will occur - there seem to be no thought behind your (actually there is none) argument.
---
1. Alchemy is one of the probably easiest professions to level
---
2. People will flood the market with herbs in the beginning
---
3. To transmute Arc Bars you only need level 35 - farming Arcane Crystals requires a higher level due to zones. Therefore there will be a lot of people able to transmute compared to those who can farm the crystals
---
4. In my mind (beside Arcanite Reaper) there is no real use at the early stage of Vanilla for Arcanite Bars - things surely change as soon someone gets Lionheart Helm recipe
---
If you are healing, dwarf is clearly better then human in pvp.  
---
Stoneform breaks blind that alone is massive.  The rogue counter to BOP is blind in vanilla.  Stoneform is also useful against druids(bleeds), Priests(most on horde will be UD and you can stoneform devouring plauge while silenced with it), Hunters(they will use the pet to stack poision on you, then viper so you have to dispel x6 times to get it off, stoneform saves a ton of mana), as well as against Warriors again for the bleeds.  
---
Not to mention the 10% armor gain, meaning is slightly useful as a catchall damage redux anytime you are getting focused.  
---
Perception loses value in pvp based on the number of humans on your team.  Human is the most played race on alliance, meaning the average team already has several.  If you are playing with smart people it should be getting popped any situation where a rogue is likely.  
---
Perception is abnormally bad on paladin, as even if you detect a rogue you have only one ranged ability and it is on a bit of a CD.  If you expect a rogue on paladin you already have consecrate for close range stealth denial. 
---
In addition holy paladin, especially dwarfs, functionally counter rogues.  You are with a shield the least susceptible class in the game to rogue control or rogue damage.  You can just blessing of sacrifice a nearby ally if you expect a sap, and you can tank while loling @him if he goes to kill you.  
---
If playing holy in pvp human rep matters very little.  All three of the BG reps reward primarily ret gear at exalted.  AV offers the best item in lei of the lifegiver, but it is a offhand item, so practically a pve-only item.  
---
As a healer the weapon spec matters almost 0.  Human is nice for brood of norzdumu and argent dawn rep, but that 10% is what? an extra week or two advantage on dwarf and then they catchup and the human racial literally is done forever.
---
Well, they will probably do good, like the rest
---
And that persons name would be McConnell
---
Lol wtf....didnt know the classic wow subreddit hated george carlin...dudes probably my favorite comedian of all time
---
Can I (horde) say needle dick to alliance?
---
No, it's the things out of gnomer that you put the grime encrusted objects inside of.
---
I still have omen installed on retail. Definitely going to need to when I play a lock in classic.
---
The people let go were low level CMs and GMs etc and people tied to the failing (outside of Overwatch) eSports division.  This isn’t the end of Blizzard and it’s not indicative of any change in direction at the company.
---
I've been saying the same thing.  Mark Kern was someone that minimally contributed to vanilla and then left the company.  Once he failed he jumped on the bandwagon for the Nostalrius shutdown.  He's riding the little work he did 15 years ago to make a name for himself now.  He also holds pretty extremist ideas on some topics and reminds me of an incel.
---
Wow, was it 3 silver? I don't remember that. 3 silver is a fucking fortune at that level on a new server. Definitely not worth it.

I'd rather stay in Casual/Fun guilds anyway. I'm in one right now and we completed everything up to and including AQ40, they take along offspecs and everyone has a great time. I'm powershifting/Off tank and no one seems to mind. They place me in a melee DPS group and watch the crits fly.
---
Coal?! I put 3 silver into this thing and it gives me fucking coal???
---
Ok thank you that helps. Dueling isn't very important to me.
---
I want the helm from the last boss of gnomer just because it looks so ridiculous, it's the one with the spinning satellite on it.
---
Listen buddy
---
Hey! I've never played vanilla (I started in wotlk) and from the small research I've done warrior seems like a good choice (really good for pvp with a healer, not exremely boring like frostmage etc). Why would you say his leveling is so slow? I'd think since everyone needs tanks for dungeon he should level quite fast. Of course the respec costs are really big if you want to switch between prot and arms. Any other reason I might be missing?
---
Also, is there any sort of hybrid talent build, so with just gear swapping you'll be able to tank while also doing enough dps?
---
Have fun crafting gear 8-10 levels lower than you unfortunately, unless you decide to farm very specific areas for nodes really hard. A lot of the materials required to make gear your level are located in areas that are higher level than you, they also require a ton of mats to make the gear rather than just level the profession. 
---
You definitely play the game you want to play, but for me it was always more fun to just grab some gathering professions and get gear from dungeons.
---
I didn't say that at all.
---
TRUE
---
What's the difference between having a boss on farm and not? It's mostly if your group is good. A good group beating content is inevitable. If you're group is bad, then even with a warrior instead of a feral tank, they're going to fail.
---
Madseason is in and streaming :)
---
It’s not too bad really, you quest in hillsbrad and do the circle of quests that include the mountain lions and turtles, kill the ones up near the road to western plaguelands. Get the chill wind point flight path and then do a couple corpse runs (or bring a group and heal each other through the mob damage) to get to the bulwark and you are super close from there. Now you already have WP flight path as well.
---
Ok. I actually have a question about nightfall. I find it very hard to notice when it pops during a fight. Is there anything I'm missing or should I just keep watching for it?
---
Isn't scarlet worth it also though? I mean it's 4 dungeons.
---
pservers are cesspools, filled with people craving a feeling of entitlement by trying to "serverfirst" 14 years old content. You cannot compare that to a healthy community.
---
looks generic
---
There is actually a clear line. I'm 34, for instance, and really the top age of "Its cool to be a gamer" while my brother who is 39, truly had a different experience with peer pressure and such. 
---
People over the age of 44 are 50% less likely to have a tattoo, compared to millennials, whom are 50% less likely to have visible tattoos compared to 18-22 year olds.
---
Speaking for myself, I turned in a bunch of quests at level 30 for mount money. There weren't a lot of quests left that I could do efficiently.
---
With a good group and decent gear you can churn through dungeons pretty quickly. I even hit the instance cap in GY for a minute or so last night, so we were clearing it in about 12 minutes, getting about 2.5 bars of xp per clear. It probably is slower than questing with no mob competition, but that's not the scenario many people were in last night. 
---
I also have a lot more fun doing group play like this.
---
Really? Most SM ruin builds go for reduced Shadowbolt cast time though.
---
Mage is by far the highest gold per hour class in the game, it just takes more planning and skill to make it happen.
---
Hunter is also a pretty good gold per hour class, but it doesn’t take nearly as much planning or skill.
---
You went from a race car to a tricycle.
---
You're being sarcastic, right?
---
Lich King had a pretty big build up to it as well. Trial of Crusader was supposed to find Azeroths greatest champions for ICC. Plus you had the 3 dungeons released alongside to vamp up the lore aspect even.
---
A 15 year old game that's been emulated for years upon years will be fine, too much hype is going to dissapointed some, though.
---
Wait, are you saying you are too stupid to figure out that "95% of players" was just another way of saying "most people"?

WHAT WHOA HOW DID I MISS THIS
---
It's not a complete waste because the stats are helpful. I like it because you can apply armor kits + enchanments on the same piece of gear for ma ximum extra stats, for some reason that makes me happy to have double buffed gear.
---
This is why I loved the 10-man raids in TBC, and why I love the 5-mans.
---
In a 40-man, or even a 20- or 25-man, the ability to be the jack of all trades becomes less and less of a boon, and the lack of production in one area becomes a hindrance.
---
If you're in a 5-man group that has Warrior, Priest, Mage, Warlock, Rogue, then if the Priest or Warrior gets CC'd, there's not much the rest of the group can do to help out.  I mean, there are things you can do, but the Warlock can't use Drain Life to heal the tank and nobody can taunt the mobs off the healer.  A druid being able to take on whatever role is needed is a huge benefit here.
---
In a 40-man, you've got more warriors, you've got more healers.  Someone will pick up the slack.
---
So what?
---
Does that take anything away from you?
---
I am not even going out on a limb here, when I say that you don't have the Scarab Lord Title, and you had no realistic chance of ever getting it. Same here btw.
---
Posts like these are panicking over things that don't even affect you, it's absurd.
---
It takes a certain level of player who likes PVP in general, and I have never even thought of making a character on one of the servers.  I usually just pick RP and it is just fine.
---
As other people have mentioned, shard farming time is negligible, it probably takes up just as much time as conjuring food/water for an entire raid.
---
Also, if you don't want to be 1-button spamming PvE, Mage is the same, if not worse.
---
I'm my point of view threat is part of the game and you need to deal with it. 
---

---
They did it without KTM when threat was harder, so it's not impossible, right ?
---
KTM allow us to be more efficient but since threat isn't displayed natively it's because Blizzard think we can do it without an addon ? Which in my opinion should stay optionnal.
---
I'm wrong somewhere ?
---
/point
---
/laugh
---
Yeah but you are still wrong...concerning healers, Paladins were in pair with Priests and were actually better in some scenarios! So in a raid setting they were NOT basically just there for buffs, far from that actually.
---
Now healing on Vanilla was so much more than HPS numbers and analyzing meters but since we are talking about it, it went like this (varying with the enconter ofc):
---
Paladin &gt;= Priest &gt; Shaman &gt;= Druid
---
There were some achievements for doing it in a specific order. It's one of the requirements to get the Protodrake. But no Hardmode.
---
I also think it would be very cool if the bosses dropped "legendarys" which aren't gear upgrades but instead. Items that activate heroic transformations. Something along the lines of when you activate it. You ridiculously insane boosts but, the catch is it lasts for 6 hours and has a 1 time a month usability.
---
I just really like the idea of creating. "Hercules" type moments. Then every once in a while you drop in a boss so hype and so powerful. The only way he gets stopped is if all the heroes with all the legendarys unite to oppose him backed by the entire server.
---
This is what I've been thinking too. I'm coming from runescape, I loved training non-combat skills in that game. Why are crafting professions considered end game in Classic? Just for the cost? It seems weird that people are saying take your time and enjoy levelling but also the prevailing attitude is to optimise levelling professions.
---
You certainly can, starting at Wool, Silk, and eventually runecloth .
---
The introduction of bgs is definetly what killed wpvp. Not flying mounts, not tbc, not arena. Bgs are much more efficient and will once again kill wpvp
---
I only played to like 30 and I couldn't tell the difference from what I remembered from 10 years earlier.
---
Still a great name
---
If you’re serious about PvP, you need engineering always. It gives so much extra utility.
---
For mages, tailoring is very good as you can make powerful BoP robes.
---
Anyone that completes the quest within 10 hours of the first hit gets it, not just the first person.
---
The more weeks it takes for the war effort event to complete, the more raiders in your guild can complete the scepter quest to be a Scarab Lord.
---
If you're a guild leader trying to convince 40 other people that your guild needs to rush it for no other reason than so you and only you can be the special one, it's a great recipe to get the rest of your raiders to resent you and not want to raid for you anymore.
---
I'm sure it will happen (especially with streamers), but I'd bet more often than not people will do the reasonable thing.
---
It's all sunshine and rainbows when you're here speculating but it's a whole different ball game when you're giving specific details/examples.
---
You don't have righteous fury on - I assume Esfand is tanking it? The really twinked out level 30?
---
This, the mistake people make is thinking this is for them, it's not.
---
Achievements are not hard modes.

You responded to a guy that said you could quickly google it to confirm, and you reply with nonsens anyway instead of actually checking.
---
How do you aoe farm on paladin?  Something to do with SM?
---
That's the issue. Addons are in my opinion : optionnal. But if i don't use them i will be blamed... Wtf ?
---
You're missing the point. The meta achiev was completed and desired for the mount. The actions in the fight made it harder. It was a 'hardmode'. reread my post if it didn't make sense to you.
---
I'll try, thx !
---
shamans cant equip swords
---
i stopped reading since you have no idea what youre talking about obviously
---
Dwarf or draenei imo
---
Okay

Only played a little bit of blade and soul, but I know many of the problems plauging these Korean MMOs are the in-game money shops where it can get a bit p2w
---
Which is completely ruined in Legion. I came back to it for friends and leveled a DH and did all the quests. One final quest has you take 2 letters from Illidan and give then to his brother and Tyrande. The letters are an attempt to put he past behind him and to forgive and forget but what do those two do? They all but rip the letters up before going off to fuck in Illidans old prison cell as one final fuck you to him.
---
Now if only they'd get the hint and fix this on modern WoW too &gt;.&lt;
---
I responded saying we were literally talking about a quest hub. 
---
We need another subreddit boys cuz this aint it.
---
Lost it at the communist logo.
---
The real joke in this thread is seeing how many of you think you’ll ever see ONE binding drop let alone BOTH.  There won’t be anything for you to ninja.
---
Oh I hope so...
---
Nice, sadly my old photobucket is full of broken links and none of the pictures work. :(
---
Redridgelol was a hunter with a pet boar called Bellygrub after the quest mob in the area.   
---
They just kept using Eyes of the Beast with Bellygrub to massacre young adventurers.
---
Honestly bc was way grindier than vanilla in a lot of ways. Gear was locked behind raid lockouts and limited supply in vanilla. Having more opportunities to get stuff in bc didn’t make it easier. Heroic grinding was still a lot of work and raiding was still difficult. What grind for gear are you remembering in vanilla other than pvp gear ? Cause most of the gearing issues in vanilla were people either were in bad guilds and couldn’t clear content or they were just gated behind low loot amounts and raid lockouts. And I love both versions, but the heroics and limited badge gear in the beginning of bc was awesome imo. When they released more catchup badge gear after sun well that was worse but still not bad.
---
Your dps does go up with upgrades.  In addition your other stats like mana pool and hp pool will go up.  It is just noticeable that your dps gain is not as fast as others classes.
---
Guilds usually aren’t a democracy. There will be guilds that want to rush it just to fuck everyone else over. This happened during vanilla, it will be even worse now.
---
I know you have 10 hours after the first bang, but if the gong is banged and your guild is not ready... Rip. Or it happens in the middle of the night when most of your guild is offline.
---
looks like a slot machine to me
---
doesn't your thumb hurt with all that button clicking?  I have a naga and i have to constantly swap between it and the keyboard because those side buttons make my thumb hurt after a while.  They need to make them more comfortable.
---
There is an argument to be had, you just won't hear it. I explained why you don't take Sword Spec while leveling until 58 [here](https://redd.it/bwx1su).
---
&gt;Lich King was a major lore pay-off. Putting him behind a giant barrier and hiding him away from the masses would be a disaster. Many people remember WOTLK fondly because THEY killed the Lich King.
---
Wrong. Catering to a bunch of bads that dont want to put in the work required to see the content was one of the main steps towards the game being a watered down mess.
---
Everyone has the same chance to see the content when they buy the game. If someone is too lazy to find a raiding guild, get consumabes and show up every week then too bad. You should not experience the content.
---
Having exclusive content gated behind effort is what makes the game have soul.
---
What's up with the spaces? Can you do it with out them?
---
Looking back, my wording wasn't good either, I meant that there are good soloing classes, but the Warrior isn't one. But if you have a healer, the warrior is nice!
---
Doesnt seem like that big of a deal on either side tbh
---
An amazingly bad video.
---
* The sound is awful. The noise is louder than the actual voice, and the voice quality sounds like a 2$ microphone collected from a yard-sale
---
* What the f\* are those badly done MSPaint-Images? Every single video editing software allows you to put text and shapes on the screen. And even if you wanna use Paint: Text-Elements are a thing, even in MSPaint
---
* At least get the Capitalization right in your questions
---
* At least use proper English in Questions. "_How is this Zone displayed on the map_" ... What?
---
Were you though?      
---
You sure you weren't just complaining about how you cant say the name of a quest hub because it has the same name as a private server?
---
Ooh, I heard it in his voice.
---
This sh1t just shows how overpriced that brand is.
---
I can bet, some idiot will even save money to buy this.
---
Next will be screws and plugs for 200 $, you wont fix this prestige just with some cheap screws.
---
I was levelling to 10 on Beta earlier and hunter is incredibly chill. Granted, I rarely pulled more than one mob, but ig you strafe/jump back after every autoshot you can literally "kite" from level 1 and usually do 1 melee auto attack at most at the end to finish them off.
---
Unless you're just shooting twice wjen you pull and then get your face bashes in, I dont see the difficulty at all.
---
Not gonna give you a source, because it's all come up after he appearently doxxed himself during the duel tourney. Personally I have no clue what to think, and I honestly hate the witch hunt that this type of shit causes online. But I guess if he continues to just ignore it, we have our answer?
---
I played vanilla from release to Naxx. Cleared up to 4-horsemen in Naxx, part of a top raiding guild on our server from almost the start and played very intensively up until I quit. We basically raided all 40man-raids and lockouts each week. I ended with basically BiS for my whole character (Rogue) so T3 or equivalent. Did a moderate amount of PvP or farming during lockout. Ended with about 100 days played on my character feeling maxed out before TBC.
---
I only follow 1 WoW youtuber, Preach, and hes already in. Hes a great combination of a hilarious personality, in depth game knowledge, and when he presents complaints with the game he tries to do it in the most calm and objective way possible, often describing why he feels it's wrong and bad in detail.
---
I really don't care man because you're sitting here for a day arguing with people which convinces me ur build is pretty controversial
---
Tbh they're all worth it, idk why you wouldn't want to do *any* of those dungeons. Isn't the whole point of classic for the nostalgia? For the feels? So you can once again snap your keyboard in half like the days of old when your healer says "sorry guys I gtg" halfway through your 4 hr long gnoner excursion? I'm sure as fuck looking forward to it
---
To me, it sounds like you should play priest, shortly followed by possibly mage but with your concerns in place, I'd say priest. It seems to be the one you're most excited about and honestly, no matter what you play, you'll find a group to do whatever you want.
---
In the end it's about having the most fun and that seems to be priest in your mind! (from what I can tell at least lol)
---
I think I noticed it in Cata or MoP. The Deathcarger used to have that sweet galloping animation that was unique to it at the time. A couple expansion later I noticed it now used the default human horse animation. I think the Hearthsteed and invinicible are the closest to what the old animation was.
---
Mulgore is probably one of the most pleasant looking zones, its sad that its so out of the way.
---
The other classes can do it, much much later and aren't as good at it as mage
---
Holy Nova Priest.
---
barksin + thorns + Hurricane druid. (much smaller pulls than mage with with a big rest every pull.)
---
I think pallies do it with retaliation, some pots, trinkets and consecration.
---
The warlock has a  leveling style where they chain pull like a hunter, but instead of one mob at a time they may constantly have 3 ore more mobs dying while they are running  to next pack of mobs.   They don't have the CC or aggro management to make Rain of Fire or Hellfire work reliably without at least a duo.
---
So there is a chance I can get blacklisted on my server for killing a streamer when I'm completely unaware they're a streamer. And they refuse to run on PvE servers? 
---
Do people take them seriously or is the streamer situation really just a non issue of a vocal minority?
---
Well, good luck on the US Servers, playing with these entitled morons.
---
I will enjoy the german servers :-)
---
Jesus christ mate everyone knows how rare it is. Hence why I said if I see it I'm straight up ninjaing that shit
---
Titanpanel was a favorite addon of mine back in vanilla.  I have no idea if it will be available when classic launches.
---
Why? I can jump into D3, open a rift in seconds and get through the whole thing in 2-5 minutes. 95% of that time is combat where I get to mow down rooms of mobs using whatever my chosen build is. Afterwards it's quick to ID and sort through the loot, melt the rest down, and then open another one.
---
I can take a break from whatever I'm working on and unwind very efficiently.  Certainly I don't always have short play sessions (like on weekends), but when I do it's there.
---
My topic was about the fact that you are unable to properly search and parse info on this subreddit because posts are being removed when referencing that quest hub. I expressed frustration at it makes sharing info on that zone's status at phase 1 harder.
---
That post got nuked too , but manually. The thing is the manual lock from the moderater he seems to think we're discussing the psrv when in reality I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW LHC WILL BE QUEST WISE IN PHASE 1.
---
jesus christ
---
I will never need to have a remastered version.  Masterpieces only need done once (er...twice?)
---
This is one of the #Changes that makes sense. It’s not changing anything about the game. If anything, it’s #Nochanges to suggest keeping the materials unknown. 
---
Back in Vanilla, the War Effort was this massive sudden initiative that would boom the economy and get people busy. Now, it’s literally a 1 year initiative starting at launch to farm certain mats. 
---
There’s no rush, there’s no “war effort”. We’re not chasing a feeling by changing the materials. We’re keeping the mechanic the same by changing the materials. It’s an actual gameplay element that will be *missing* if they remain the same.
---
That's a hard thing to help with given such little information. If you really like the thought of both, maybe go for the faction you've least played, giving yourself a bit of a new experience.
---
I'm playing a female Dwarf priest. 
---
For progressions, can't decide if I should do tailoring and enchanting or go with a collection proffesion for gold. Or do 1 each like tailoring/skinning. Help. I was like 13 when I played Vanilla and never really worked on professions besides first aid and fishing.
---
Thanks for the feedback mate, as mentioned within the video i have not done anything like this before and it was my first crack at it. I don't know how to use any video editing software or anything like that and as mentioned within the video, i wanted to focus on the questions over the quality of the presentation or picture of video. If thats what you're looking for when looking at a "Quiz", then you're in the wrong place bud. But again, thanks for the feedback :)
---
With that attitude, sure.
---
Nope. Anything that doesn’t net me gold to save up for my mount is a waste of time and gold. I don’t wanna wait until 45 before I finally get my mount. Professions are a waste of money during lvling unless you already have a lvl 60.
---
Id love to see kungen get a second world first KT
---
Eyedrool, what a magnificent name! I really hope you find your friend man, cool story and best of luck.
---
Seems legit.
---
In theory, if they are in the hands of equally skilled players with proper talents, the lock *should* win
---
Mages do well against classes like warr and rogue where their kiting and ability to reset can be displayed.
---
Resetting against lock is doable, just much harder with dots the and pet
---
Obviously the duel tourney over the weekend was at a lvl 30 meta, but watching venruki vs snutz gives some solid insight to the overall playstyle of the two classes when they 1v1
---
I agree. I just think it's wack that the info is gated behind the quest hub name and the mods aren't able to contextualize it. You get a worse subreddit experience overall. I can vote with my participation and find a new place to hang out. I'm not super frustrated but just puzzled at how this became the main vanilla hangout spot. 
---
Are there sub alternatives?
---
&gt;easier than we all remember.
---
Speak for yourself, because I remember Chainpulling in UBRS without anyone ever having to drink.
---
The only ones who "remember" it wrong, are the PServer kiddos, and people who let themselves get influenced by those dingleberries.
---
I don't understand the post. You're basically asking "why can't I not use add-ons and not be blamed for mistakes it normally would tell me about?". Feel free to not use add-ons, but if u fuck up, saying "I don't have DBM" is NOT a good excuse. That's your choice, you deal with the consequences.
---
Wait, I'm confused. Will we have the argent Dawn quests in phase 1? Since they were in patch 1.12?
---
Entitled ? Yeah, maybe, a bit.  
---
But at the same time. Why do you care ? If you're not part of the cult, why give a damn ? Why stream snipe ? Why even get involved ?  
---
Don't get me wrong, I like watching streams, but I don't get the people that go so out of their way to either annoy them or lick a streamer's boots ( there's no middle ground ).  
---
Live and let live, you know ?    
---
If he wants a blacklist, let him have a blacklist, that's what the community should do anyway, avoid playing with toxic players so they can correct themselves.
---
pserservers are i trhink the alrgest target audience and group of classic players
---
they would also certainly also be the best equipt to steamroll the content, vs the rest of us who havent played or never took place in  p servers
---
I suspect warlock will be more common this time around.  So purely based on how in demand, it would be priest.
---
again
---
Purely from an aesthetic and racial perspective undead is better
---
No they aren't. But if you loot part of the mob but not the quest item (no room in inventory for example) then it immediately becomes ffa. Tested this during stress test on the echoing Isles quests several times.
---
&gt;!remindme 82 days
---
Um if u make a mistake no shit you'll be blamed, what?
---
Try searching lmao. I have no clue. Anytime you say LHC the post gets nuked and that is what makes searching it hard. Mods don't want us to discuss a quest hub because they aren't aware of it being a quest hub in the first place. They only heard of the psrv.
---
Yeah that's cuz u were dueling as a fire mage vs melee
---
Not saying that's like the worst thing a human could do, but you can't expect to win msot duels as fire. You'd be better off vsing casters as fire.
---
Frost will dumpster a warr, like a mediocre mage should be able to kill a top tier warr the mage kit is just superior and perfectly counters warr kit.
---
Im planning on gathering til 60 and then levelling crafting professions.
---
&gt;Badge and catch-up gear made sense in Burning Crusade. It only really got out of hand starting with WOTLK IMO
---
No it got out of hand during IoQ when 90% of content became irrelevant.
---
There was a guild on my server called horde core pwnogrophy. I feel like we had a few nagas runnin about too hahaha. Some crazy guild names are surely on the horizon!
---
yes id say that knowing the list is a change, as the list was unknown. 
---
it would severely lower the amount of people who get to do a whole questline and achieve something great
---
Yeah, your just trying to get the last word now. Its pretty sad. Go on now, one more respons. Make it count big boi
---
Reads like you went out looking for an argument/to be a victim, and got what you wanted.   
---
Do I completely agree with the way this sub is moderated (or the face it is ClassicWoW instead of WoWClassic)? No. But doesn't mean I care that you got exactly what you were after.    
---
There's plenty of ways to discuss the quest hub(s) in EPL if that's legitimately what you wanted.
---
Honestly, I did gathering professions while leveling and just selling everything. Didn't want to play the AH because it's not that fun for me and that helped me get quite a lot of gold. Once I hit cap, that was when I changed to Alchemy (in your case tailoring/echanting) and didn't find it hard to level those up.
---
Wasn't sure about vanilla, but know there were times when cloth spell crit gear was like 100% mages only as it was the 3rd or 4th stat in line for warlocks.
---
Stop being a Jebroni bro. Chill out. It's okay to be wrong sometimes.
---
If you didn't care, you wouldn't have asked the question by making a thread. And it wasn't an argument, someone that cared more than you asked for a detailed explanation, so I gave it. Then they thanked me.
---
Yes, you can be.
---
People think the list is for toxic players, but that's not how people work. Do something they don't like? Blacklist. Win a roll over them? Blacklist. Kill them in WPvP fairly when you were just defending yourself from a gank? Blacklist.
---
They hold all the power, good luck seeing that power used fairly.
---
This is against what WoW is about, especially classic.
---
Thanks for your help I think I’ll do what you said feral first then decide. I would rather not spend my life wasted away drinking water every poll.
---
Fuck the rest, jump flips for life!
---
Yeah dude. I love being a victim. Nice projection there? Lmao. Redditors are wild.
---
&gt; Why not get both? 
---
Oh I am all for people getting what they want, so if that was possible, I think it'd be amazing. But I don't know how you would \[realistically\] do it. 
---
I don't think blizz will want to split their community even further by splitting the classic branch into more little branches.
---
&gt; Why get TBC over 1.13? 
---
That's a simple one I think... the same reason they did classic. Because it already happened once and it was great, and people look back at it with fondness and more importantly because there is a public who would play it.
---
Over... something that's completely new, which might very well be a thousand times better than TBC, but again, TBC is a proven formula, just as Classic is.
---
How can you tell high level content was castrated when max level in Beta is 40?
---
Couldn‘t watch that BS to the end. Well maybe ppl wait to gear up and then just streamsnipe you... mr. Sodapoppin. Eat that.
---
I don't care about YOUR response because you're a nuisance. and that was one guy who thanked you, everyone else was arguing. Just stop bro you're annoying
---
How do I get "thicc" (Common to Orcish)?
---
&gt; significant QoL affec
---
&gt; little of an impact on gameplay
---
Which one is it? When will people understand that QoL IS gameplay?
---
thats false again, if i wanna gold grind, i would run maradon on my hunter and just focus on boss. If i wanna help out lowbies in low dungeons, again, just send pet after boss and it will aggro everything and pet wont take any damage. its the quickest way and no downtime for mana
---
I would guess the followers would take it seriously.  These servers are going to be cancer to play on unless you're the type of person that buys and reads all of the tabloids in the checkout aisle.
---
No, he's saying if you go out of your way to hunt them down. Like the two guys that ruined the pvp tournament did ( went under Stormwind as level 1 Tauren just to intrerrupt the tournament ).  
---
But if you're going out of your way just to make someone else's experience miserable, you should be shunned anyway, regardless if that other person is a streamer or not. It's just such an asshole thing to do. (an entire guild in vanilla was banned for 7 days for ruining rp events, so it's not that far fetched)
---
I know man, but my mate plays tauren and I wasnt able to load the old one in modelviewer :/
---
Nothing earned in retail should carry to classic in any way, including TCG and other cosmetic items.
---
But where are the cupcake wrappers strewn about with reckless abandon!?
---
Didnt look. I honestly thought it occured because i just overwrote the previous version and thought by deleting the old file and re-doing that it would of been fine.
---
NA servers are going too be a shitshow
---
&gt;I'm sure Blizz is well aware of the current backlash.
---
The problem is they're aware and don't give a shit.
---
So its been fixed on the beta?
---
&gt; but high level content was definitely castrated.
---
What exactly was "castrated"?
---
Point out to me, Mr. "Powergamer", where change exactly "castrated" the higher level 5mans and UBRS. To help you out, here is [a comprehensive listing of all patches in the 1.x cycle](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x)
---
Vanilla dungeons were always easy if you knew what you are doing. They were not meant to be hard.
---
100%, same.
---
It doesn't matter if it's changed, someone will bang the gong at 3am server time on a Wednesday and everyone will be fucked, they will do it for the banter and drama
---
personality
---
AFAIK they *always* showed from far away. This is not a bug and not problematic - issue with nameplates is that they ignore obstacles, meaning you can't hide from an enemy behind a tree to ambush them etc.
---
I have no watched this video but I have a hard time believing people who make their livings off WoW streams and YouTube content all agreed that the game would be less successful if they make said content and that they should all not stream the level 50-60 content as a result.
---
It was a bug that blizz fixed immediately , has nothing to do with what folder you open it from
---
Yep! Gonna be going Undead Mage (Rocking out all day long!) and Tailoring/Enchanting.
---
This is really good. Nice job
---
Request invite was where you could right click someone’s name plate and you would see “request to join group” , or something similar to that. The party leader would then be prompted with a message that asked him if he wanted to invite the player that requested.
---
Why are you so triggered lmao? Do all those fights and tell me which way is harder and think about why you'd want to do em that way anyway. 
---
Saying those fights don't have  a hardmode is just straight up wrong considering your guild HAD to kologarn the  tough way a few times before farm status to make sure everyone got their mounts
---
It's okay to be wrong sometimes my friend.
---
How are they going to be able to tell if I'm stream sniping or just camping because I'm bored and waiting by que? 
---
Avoiding toxic players is one thing, using your influence to blacklist someone on the other faction because they're better than you is another.
---
Yah I’m thinking horde since I raided up to AQ40 with alliance. Is it easier to rank up in pvp as one over the other? Like do all the hardcore pvp-era go horde so I won’t face them when solo queue I to battlegrounds?
---
Thanks for the help I’m going to probably go this way for the less downtime between mobs. 
---
The 0/30/21 is like a hybrid healer cat for PvP if I’m right?
---
That spec is a high-end PvP spec which requires very good gear to pull off. Really not a leveling spec, mate
---
STEGGIES ARE FROM ~~^(ZANDALAR)~~ UN'GORO
---
I need this as a 3x3 poster
---
Yes.  Agent Dawn existed since at least 1.3, including the rep/turn-ins and much of the gear. Naxx won't be in at launch and the associated quest to get attunement may be missing. But the core quest hub/items should be relatively intact.
---
Because they wanted to.
---
In this argument.
---
Your comment score: - 13

My comment score: + 15

That's a knockout kid.

---
Hi, /u/onequartercup_flour
---
Lol thanks for the input I don’t have time for the slowest experience of my life.
---
Blizzard NEEDS to corral the streamers onto one server. Especially this manchild.
---
You gotta do it though. Hydrocane.....
---
Aye, but I do kind of wish they'd tried. I am still pretty confident they wouldn't have done it. They were really struggling with some of the RFD mobs with the captains which I think are level 40ish, and those packs had some non elites too. 
---
There's later pulls in Uldaman with full packs of 44 elites. The flame buffet pulls after basalisk boss would have been rough.
---
Not really sure why people think this is a real issue. Much as you guys wanna hate. All the streamers have said. They are going to play on the same server. So it's not a crazy thing to think they are going to have huge sway on the server. The solution will be easy if you don't want to deal. Play on one of the hundreds of other servers. You'll be fiine.
---
it wont shut down, keep wishing
---
Yeah if you pull threat because you have no idea what your threat is and get one shotted thats on you

This title is misleading and the post has been removed. Please consider reposting with an accurate title.
---
&gt; Yeah dude. I love being a victim.    
---
I mean clearly you do. You're doing it all over this thread. Even that reply is playing into it, I am picking on you now or whatever.    
---
Ultimately you created a post you knew would get removed, then you claimed you were the victim of unfair moderation, then claim people are picking on you when they suggest you did it for attention.
---
Ya. Joana’s guide specifically says if you don’t have the quest and an easy portal to its turn in then it’s not worth the time to travel to the dungeon and back to your questing zone afterwards
---
He drew a paralell to the two level 1 tauren that went under stormwind to intrerrupt the tournament, which is an extreme example of annoying someone (even Blizzard got involved).  
---
If you're camping an area and not following them to the other continent, exploiting a glitch to get to a secret area just to gank them, then you're not at fault.
---
Lmao, do you honestly expect them to be on reddit doing damage control 24/7?
---
They've already shown ample times that they're listening.
---
Yeah, I agree. If you make an exception for 1 thing, then it may end up opening the possibility for many others.
---
But.... You didn't play classic. You started in TBC...
---
And you even stated yourself that [not having a LFR feature](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btydvm/if_classic_is_even_remotely_successful_i_feel/ep72h88/) made you a better player because you reached out to people.
---
I don't see how I u/taco_juo448 is "blindsided people". And he actually played classic.
---
It has been feeding the anti-Apple circlejerk on reddit today. It's hilarious to watch the *amount* of misinformation
---
Yes, the stand is ridiculously overpriced.
---
But the monitor itself is legitimately *insanely* good, and thousands cheaper than its competition in the same specification. It's not for consumers. It's not made for 99,99% of this website.

Herbalism
---
I'm sure you one of the persons who want beta just to play the game and won't really care about bug testing
---
yeah, that doesnt mean you have a reason to cast it. no reason to unless its a NF proc OR they're at rooted at range/far enough where you can actually cast it but this rarely happens
---
I mean I have several server firsts dating back to achievements being added. Cleared raids prior consistently. But you’re probably right. Bad players everywhere. 
---
Or maybe, idk, it could have been bad players and all raiding, including BC/Classic, is substantially easier than people think it is. 
---
Your choice. Either A, bad players was enough to clear content because they involved a ret pally who out-DPS’d them, or B, raiding is a joke and therefore your class/spec doesn’t matter.
---
Are you okay man?
---
&gt;I don't know how to use any video editing software or anything like that

Honestly the lack of gear in Vanilla was probably too far on the scarce end imo. I understand your PoV in that scarce gear makes it much more satisfying when you do get gear and that the current version of wow where you are just drowning in gear at all times is really shitty, but I think that TBC hit a better balance of time investment vs gear return than Vanilla did. 
---
You seem to be really coming at this from the approach that everyone agrees Vanilla's systems were in every way superior to all other systems in any version of wow ever. I think alot of people here agree that overall Vanilla was probably the best version of wow, but that doesn't mean that all of it's systems were the best. You can't just take it as a given that since the gear aquistion rate was X in vanilla that it means that TBC's Y rate was different and therefore worse. 
---
You'd first have to make the case as to why Vanilla is better in this regard before you can state objectively that TBC is worse. What if we just cut Vanillas gear drop rate in half. Would that be better or worse? Why or why not? Why specifically is the drop rate of gear in Vanilla ideal? What makes it ideal? We need answers to these questions before you can just make blanket statements on why one is better than the other. 
---
Vanilla was an amazing game, but all games have flaws. In this regard I think TBC had the best approach of any version of the game in terms of time investment vs gear return.
---
ITT: Op asks a question, gets a logical response he doesn't like, tells the people that took the time to answer they're annoying.
---
Okay kid, good luck with leveling. You might make it to 60 by New Years.
---
It's not entitled at all. They are all going to play on the same server. Most of the streamers of T1 players. It's not going to be a shock they have crazy sway on their home terf. If you don't like, pick any other server. 
---
From when I played classic. Black listing isn't new. Top guilds did it all the time. Becoming persona non grata with the top guilds on your server has always been a death sentence if you wanna raid at a high level. Essentially this isn't news. Nor is it new.
---
&gt; Do you have any source for this info?   
---
I read the vanilla patch notes. AD was in from before 1.3 and were the main quest source for EPL/WPL pre-dating Naxx itself. So it is unlikely they'd be closely tied to the Naxx introduction for that reason.
---
&gt;That's a recipe for having the game dying..
---
Things die. It's okay. Classic having a big hurrah to celebrate the franchise, sticking around for a few years, and dying off in favor of something else is honestly fine. It really is honestly fine. The idea that classic needs to linger around forever as some sort of fetid abomination, a dead shell of itself... nah. That sounds like a miserable fate.
---
True, but that's a solution to a problem that you don't necessarily need to have if you like your character's voice.
---
I'm prolly picking both
---
Please include that it's localized to a single unit/facility. Sorry to be a stickler, but I think it's important to avoid people reading just the headline and moving on.
---
People always ask me, Bill...how do I...HURL! bolts of lightning?
---
By playing world of Warcraft of course!
---
Two things:
---
a) Which one? 
---
b) How do you go on proving that it was one guild closing the event down to keep mounts for themselves instead of you know.. people just wanting to raid AQ so they turned in shit? You can't, because none is retarded enough to care about saving up the entire war effort mats list.
---
I'm pretty set on playing a Warlock first time through, but want to dive into end game content at 60. I'm sure I'll be doing some PvP as they phase those in, but I was curious what the consensus was on professions here. Is Tailoring/Engineering just too good to pass up? Or could I get away with Alch. to help facilitate consumables for raiding?
---
&lt;Kodo Mojo Dojo&gt;
---
Thanks! I think once I’m 60 and can come up with enough gear I’ll give this a shot
---
Is this how base melee ap worked in vanilla? Base to me seems like with no gear. Clearly here it isnt
---
Thats just silly. World pvp isnt illegal so why make it illegal becouse you decided to stream. If you cant take getting ganked dont stream or go play on a pve realm.
---
\`yuck new models
---
username checks out Kappa Pride (no space)
---
I understand certain circumstances, but regular play can be misinterpreted. I recall being ganked by the same guy in 4 random zones over 1 day. I thought for sure he had a second account and was /who to find me. I was mad at the time. About 4 days later I ganked him and realized the reason we kept crossing paths is because we both switched to mining and were looking for nodes in similar zones.
---
If I had a super large following and were slightly less stable with slightly more rage, I could have set this guy back a lot and never found out the facts. 
---
Again, I'm not saying the Hunter that ninjas a binding should be forgotten, but in cross faction play, they are your enemy. And ganking the enemy should be good for your server presence.
---
it's not for me. Sadly I am not an iMac fan, nor a mini. I had hoped that they would have a machine with some degree of choice/ability to modify. But I think that Apple are not into that market.
---
nope its the best GM/LM anchoring spec
---
what makes it so special :')
---
All correct, but I wouldn't say they were "managing" their threat. You can't manage something when you don't know its current state. Instead it was more a case of "give the tank 10 seconds to get aggro then be careful if you crit". 
---
You can absolutely do them without KTM, I just don't know why you'd bother when everyone else will be using it.
---
&gt;pserservers are i trhink the alrgest target audience and group of classic players
---
Then you are thinking wrong.
---
PServer players will flock to Classic, sure. Will they be the majority of the playerbase? No. That will be people playing retail who don't like the direction WoW is going in, or people like me, who played and enjoyed Vanilla, and quit WoW some time ago out of disappointment.
---
My dad and I would always go pay our respects to Uther anytime we went to Scholomance. Which was rather often....
---
It wasn't ended/retconned until the release of the comic.
---
Just create the guild &lt;blacklisted&gt; and raid with all your other blacklisted bros, our gear the streamers and stream snipe them all day err day.
---
We* are the 99% comrade
---
Thanks dude. I appreciate you being nice and informative here rather than your tantrum somewhere else in the thread lol. 
---
Have any bits of info from the dev team regarding EPL in general and when the NAXX pre-stuff will come in? I guess im remembering LHC being more closely tied to NAXX than it may have been. There were world events like scourge outside major cities but I feel like im remembering long chains that came with it. Those shouldn't be in at phase 1 which is AOK to me.
---
Except a couple pets.
---
EPIC WIN xD is she snigle?
---
Of course there will be.
---
a) Because it's zero extra effort for Blizzard (The server doesn't have a "language", the client has.
---
b) The german WoW audience is the largest in Europe, they would be insane to pass up that market.
---
Mage or Priest?  I will be spending most of my time solo and will probably not have much time for raids.  Which class is easier to gear up for pvp without raiding?
---
Honestly dude if you can't take constructive criticism I don't know why you even made this thread.
---
The guy was refuting some of the points you made not by condescending to you or calling you stupid, but my making completely relevant points. Either respond like a civil human and make some valid counterpoints or don't respond at all. 
---
Talking down to people and calling them stupid when they are making completely valid points only makes you look like the idiot.
---
&gt;(outside of Overwatch)
---
And outside Hearthstone I imagine. Hearthstone's esport league is bigger than ever with weekly top-leve play. I love watching GM league. 
---
I imagine the failings in esports were mostly WoW, Heroes of the Storm, and Starcraft related. I liked the mythic dungeon invitational in Legion myself but since I don't play BFA it's hard for me to care about it in BFA... and I imagine others are in the same boat.
---
I see.
---
Yeah but not the Horde you're playing in game. In all honesty you can kinda compare it to Germany - First War Horde being the 3rd Reich, Second War Horde being the 2nd Reich and "modern" Horde being equivalent to modern Germany.
---
People actually so filled with hatred of streamers getting beta key that they intentionally take sodapopping argument completley out of content. 
---
Guy literally said that he would love to play like a normal player, no benefits no downsides.
---
Before TBC launched, there were only 3 codes you could obtain: The Tabard of Flame, the Hippogryph Hatchling pet, and the Riding Turtle, a mount that did not increase speed at all.
---
But even these 3 have no argument for being added to Classic. Landro Longshot wasn't added into the Live game until the pre-TBC patch. There was no way to redeem your TCG codes in patch 1.12.
---
Single guilds literally don't have bagspace to influence the AQ war effort that much. We're talking MILLIONS of mats. Where are you going to store them?
---
It's fine. The chances that someone will discuss that particular quest hub is really small and it's not like you get banned or something. Just create a new thread with a different name.
---
Skinning may be better. You can only track one ore or herb at a tome. But you can make a macro to switch and tap it often
---
spearmint's has been subsequently banned for mentioning lh
---
I’m almost definitely playing a mage as my primary account and then a hunter as my alt.  (I really like the idea of running lower level raids solo and just general farming of multiple mobs at once).
---
For level progression I’m set on skinning as one of my professions, but I’m not sure if I should go leatherworking, tailoring, or pick up mining/herb picking as my other main.
---
Thoughts?
---
PvE realm would be ideal. They can still steam and they are allowed to flag themselves for PvP manually. There are still BGs too.
---
All he did was make it a challenge.  Now someone wants to be at the top of the blacklist, easy fame.  Dozens are going to compete for most Soda time wasted.  Where's Whitegrape and Pirates of the Pancreas?
---
Wait...what?
---
I'm sure whenever that happened it was only for a few minutes to like half an hour. The guys that would stream snipe to ruin someone's experience are gonna do it for however long it takes them to make the streamer quit. They will do it for 10 hours every single day while they are online. He's not referring to the average Joe who he's gonna cross paths with every now and then. You might not have seen the lengths people go to to absolutely make their experience as miserable as they can.
---
10/10
---
Unfortunately that one is more server dependent I think. As Alliance, I breezed up to rank 11 and we just dominated most of the time but there is no way that was the same across all servers lol. 
---
Horde racials are better for PvP imo. WotF, Hardiness being the major two. Alliance do have Stoneform though which is really good.
---
I also recall (someone can correct me if I'm wrong) the Alliance being way more dominant in AV across the board but I think that was it.
---
It was a hardmode though... Just not for heroic gear. The meta acheiv. You still had to do something mid-fight in order to trigger a successful hardmode kill. 
---
You did it multiple times til your entire guild and alts that came along got their acheiv.
---
Every boss had a hardmode btw.
---
Guild banks would drastically alter realm economies due to the fact that banks alts could horde substantially more items, which would allow them to more easily control AH prices.
---
No, it would not alter actual game play in PVE/PVP environments
---
Was thinking of switching the one point for NG, you found it totally worth it? Thx for the feedback
---
Tailoring can make you enough gold for a mount before 40 easily. Just make silk bags. All your skill-ups should come from bags if they are in that exp range. When out of the exp range for bags, make items that directly benefit you or have the least amount of required materials. Coupling this with enchanting is great IF you think you'll be an officer in a raiding guild. Those MC/AQ enchants are big money makers.
---
A bunch of them have already said that they all planning on rolling on the same server and then trying to balance out the Alliance:Horde population.
---
That truly depends on supply/demand
---
I’ve played pservers where ore prices were absurd because no one bothered mining
---
Other ones have herbs being dirt cheap because everyone is herbing or spamming those evergreen pouch things
---
The standard of griefing is not straight forward in the slightest. The closest thing Blizzard gets to a definition of griefing is "Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment." They go on to say that players should report infractions that they believe to be unacceptable behavior but that it will be up to the person reviewing the report. So, subjective through and through. One persons corpse caming is another persons "This tauren is ruining our dueling tournament," which is just another persons repeatedly killing named quest mob to deny quest completion. What level of enjoyment are we as players entitled to and what are the bounds of that?
---
At the end of the day, every single one of these participants at that tournament were high level players. /target and /focus exist as scripting options for macros. Playing around this player was doable, but it was much easier to complain on stream to viewers and shout from the rooftops that this player was "ruining" the tournament. Yet across the 10 or so streams I was watching, not a single person reported them or even seemed to consider doing so. Probably because deep down they understood that while annoying, the behavior wouldn't be considered griefing by an impartial party.
---
Turn off a stream. He played vanilla on private servers on his free time, nobody knew who he was. So did many other famous internet people.
---
Streamers will not get to play a game "they remember"
---
That has to be a greenscreen backdrop
---
&gt;If you don't like, pick any other server. 
---
You have it backwards, it's my free time and I'll spend it how I please.  If he doesn't like that he can stop broadcasting his location to me.
---
ok. so not everyone will get scarablord big deal. be happy your not stuck playing bfa
---
&gt; this change isnt gonna shave a few days or hours, itll be weeks.
---
You are grossly underestimating how much and effective people can farm now a days. On top of that even if you do change the materials the current lists already contains most of the gatherable items in the game. The only why they would be able to drastically slow the collection down would be to include a decent amount of the "rare" drop items (arcane crystals, trugold, etc...) but that will get people pissed extremely fast since they are already rare and are in demand for other items.
---
Thank you as well, although we may not agree on 100% of everything I do respect you take! Because similarly, I've a good $1,000+ spent on WoW over the course of the last 15 years. So it's not lost upon me that holding on to a WoW sub quickly adds up.   
---
What I've a problem envisioning is this. A decrease in the sub price. Of course a lower monthly rate will be a welcomed change for many, I don't doubt this a second. However, I can also see that type of change pissing off a good chunk of the community who've payed the higher rate for months/years. In short, I don't think there is a solution to any of this. Just trade offs.
---
BC did it right - heroic versions of the 5-man dungeons you played while leveling to keep them relevant at 70; but only 1 version of the actual raids
---
The biggest money comes from doing Dire Maul/Mara at max level or ZG crocs (if your class can kite). There are a few other really good spots as well.
---
I really dont think Profs in Classic are as lucrative gold wise as people think. By farming instances, you have no competition.
---
Pick skinning as you level, and skin everything you kill, vendor. This should result in you being able to get your mount at 40, as long as you dont spend money on the AH.
---
Between herb and mining, herb is better.
---
A logical response means you call people dumb and stupid for a certain build? Well damn. Keep on reddit argueing dude, you're good at it.
---
None
---
So I can just copy and paste this in game and they will work?
---
millions into stacks of 20 become 50,000 slots n ot impossible to get that bag space over many alts
---
you underestimate what guilds will do to get world or server first.
---
Method is the reason for a lot of recent changes to raid loot functions, Blizz removed master looter, and method found a way that took 100s of hours of each guildie to circumvent the system
---
To be honest I forgot that Hearthstone even existed lol
---
I am playing a Paladin as that was my first healer at 60. It made me fall in love with healing and eventually inspired me to level a priest and never look back (have mained a priest since end of Vanilla).
---
Initially I thought of going priest, but the toolkit wasn't really there in Vanilla anyways. My brother and I leveled our Paladins together so I have some really fond memories of the class, so I am going to stick with it for at least the first while in classic. :) If I miss my priest I am sure I can level a 2nd toon with some friends down the road. In classic before the grind from 40-50 almost killed me but I think this time I am going to approach it from a "stop and smell the roses" standpoint and try to enjoy it more. Almost 15 years of focus on the end game makes me realize that I probably didn't focus on the journey enough when the game design still had that as a focus.
---
If you're gonna play solo then play Mage.
---
Wish I could upvote this by 10000,   This is the truth
---
Considering there has been years of fresh private server launches idk..... Granted WoW Classic will be different and the population will be different. Point is, nothing wrong with speculating and asking :)
---
More people could like tbc more because A. It was the first major expansion with a huge population explosion B. The dungeons / raids had bosses that reqyired more tactics than simply tank and spank with high resistance C. Pvp was given new battlegrounds and arenas to play in. 
---
Also you can argue about badge gear but it usually was only good enough to be equal to heroic,  as in it was implemented to help you get into the current raid tier,  not compete with it.
---
No? Heroics require 325 from you and drop 355
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18265/siphon-life
---
searing pain is much higher dps than drain life but if you know you're gonna get interrupted you start with drain life, then spam searing once theyre in melee range. if they're not sitting on you, kiting away with dots up should be prio
---
Can only pick one, the other one you mine
---
He said repeatedly even on private servers people somehow find out who he is and they grief him. You're vastly underestimating what the internet produces.
---
Soda is the only normal guy, he wants to play like normal, he doesn’t want army’s of players helping him.
---
Reddit has a save function, my dude. It's far more convenient.
---
So frikkin long. Took me a while to figure out i had to kill that guy near the wetlands inn xS
---
if blizz says the material list isnt final, i dont think people are gonina take that risk and just start farming.
---
Blizz can swap what each faction needs with the other, and up the values that both contribute too.
---
anyhting blizz does serverely limits the ability to preplan
---
You won't level together all the way.
---
I think you’re referring to the ziqo(mage) vs a priest duel where he had to keep sheeping him to go drink and eat, was an amazing duel he shouldn’t have won but clutched in the end somehow. I think using your classes cc in order to try and reset the fight is perfectly fine. I think the rule is there so that a rogue cant just vanish and sit in stealth waiting for cd’s which has no counter-play really, and then repeat that. In the end the rules seemed like just guidelines and the final decisions came down to whatever tips deemed fair. He wasn’t really even checking buffs or what gear they were using or if they popped potions before the duels really. It just seemed like it was a mostly “for fun” tourney that just happened to have a small prize pool for hype.
---
"relatively little work"
---
Making 1.12 run on the current client was a huge task in itself, wtf you talking about m8?
---
So, it won't make sense for people who live in this "world" to know recipes and how to make clothes, but they should know what it will take to open back up a door hundreds/thousands of years old?
---
We knew who he was on the TBC servers, we knew on the Vanilla server. We did just not fanboy about it.
---
It's not like we already had blacklists back then for various reasons. Being an asshole got you a spot on them, no matter if it was for ninjaing, scamming, griefing and excessive corpse camping (which is the main form of stream sniping and was a bannable offense in vanilla) or being a toxic troll in general.
---
I'm pretty sure streamer and their viewers can distinguish a simple gank or two versus actual griefing or annoying trolls. At the end of the day it's up to the community to act on it. Abusing a report function on the other hand can become problematic.
---
Yep and then after t4 heroics become optional.
---
+1. TBC **will** be great. 1.13 **could** be great. EZ PZ decision on Blizzard's part.
---
And I for one would love for all popular streamers to be on their own server where stream sniping is a ban-able offense. That way I could get a more authentic experience else where on other servers(akin to my vanilla experience) and I could make a char on the streamer server as well to participate in all the streamer shenanigans. The beta server has been fun at time because there are so many streamers, and it always feels like crap when I grind up money for an item that they just get given to them. 
---
I'm on the side for trying to get the best of both worlds because I think both experiences are fun in their own light. Why does everyone have to be so polar on the subject? I don't get that.
---
It changes daily, right now we're in a "hate streamers" day.
---
these 3 people are not mutally exclusive.
---
also im saying the majority of people who have a good chance at being top end will be from pservers who have been practicing for years
---
If you don't stream snipe you won't be blacklisted. Why do people spend so much time watching people they don't even like?
---
"She said she was level 18"
---
yes if the recovery system stays as it is now, but you're not supposed to be able to name change like this, it's just something that will probably get fixed before release.
---
I don't watch this guy often.  Is he in character or was he just born this way?
---
Someone posted math on this some time ago. Gnome mages can expect 2-3 more dps and cast 1-2 more frostbolts before going oom. I dont know about you but that does not seem like much of an advantage to me. Go for the looks instead.
---
Took me a second too long but good one
---
im not saying one guild did, im saying one  guild could, its reasonably to think that this has happened
---
I think too many people feel like engineering is needed for pvp, it helps but, unless you are going for a super high rank, I wouldn't worry about it. Tailoring is nice for the things you can make but every guild loves their Alchemist!
---
Didnt even know sth like that existed?  
---
Only in the US ? :P   
---
Cant drink it anyways bc of health reasons... no energie drinks for me
---
there's nothing wrong with this, but you have to have that "sales gene" in order to make it profitable.  The willingness to stand around IF advertising your enchanting services and negotiating prices, etc. 
---
I've started down the tailoring/ench path several times, but I always end up dropping the latter because I never feel like dealing with that many randos
---
If you're the main enchanter in your guild it's a bit of a different story, but I've always been a bit more casual than that.
---
Totally agree. They specifically removed the ability for the two factions to communicate. You're not supposed to circumvent the language barrier.
---
i don't like soda but i don't see a problem with what he's saying. this is how mmorpgs work. however, what will likely happen is a guild will be formed with the sole purpose of killing streamers, so if you are one of those people who stream snipe then you'll be in the company of others who follow your same beliefs. maybe some people will blacklist you, but there will also be a lot of other people who will accept you for the same actions.
---
For leveling, I'd say herbalism is the better of the two because nodes will spawn in the middle of everything and not just on the fringes and in caves. You won't have to go as far out of your way.
---
For money, it remains to be seen. Showing up to every raid with every consumable is going to be a Vanilla thing, not a Classic thing. It's just unnecessary. Flasks will still be used, but like you said, guilds are going to have Lotus on lockdown and casual players will not be able to compete.
---
Which one is better also depends on your class. There are certain mining routes and instances that not all classes can solo.
---
Nothing wrong with speculation I suppose, I just dont think it is even possible to get an answer that is reasonablly accurate. We have no idea how many people will play, let alone get to the level required to farm the mats. We don't know what the demand for that mat is going to be. Just too many variables. Don't let me rain on yalls parade, just saying don't invest interest too deeply on speculation...
---
Wife goals?
---
This is the most perfect representation of how loot in BFA works except replace 3 silver with time as a currency.
---
Nostalgia.
---
wtf are you smoking lol, go watch the blizzcon presentation, they are not using private server data
---
I dont even like it but Id buy a few for launch day lol
---
If two people competing for Rank 14 sent "hit squads" at the other person do you believe that this should be bannable/suspendable as well?
---
If they don’t, pretty sure I could just drop red or blue food coloring in my own Mountain Dew.
---
Did it even have an ah in vanilla? I remember hanging out there a ton but...
---
he said relatively. like compared to making a whole new game.
---
It's easy to assume they're entitled and want special treatment out of the pure hatred this sub has festered over time, but that's true, blacklists have existed before the notion of streaming did.
---
I just don't get it. You have perks of making a HUGE amount of money to play games, and then there's downsides. Downside - stream sniping. If you're so worried about wpvp trolling, go on a PVE server. No one should have to cater to them. They aren't anything special, and they get treated like gold.
---
I never even pay attention to them and this may be my first ever post about streamers, but it's kinda pathetic. They are willing to accept the hand outs of people buying their mounts, BoEs, raid leaders passing them EVERYTHING, AND getting paid to do all of this, but they can't take the opposite side of the spectrum. It's not all roses. Either suck it up or play pve. 
---
I can see this being massively abused and power hungry, and that was NOT classic.
---
No because these only game out during wrath.
---
Well I guess I need to reopen my team speak server now.
---
its real, its unfortunate but entertaining.
---
What if blizz had an official streamer server where stream sniper was a ban-able offense? You as a regular player would be well aware that this server is a streamer server with those rules in place. Not only does this let you avoid any of the negative that streamers may bring, it'll also allow them to have a better experience.
---
What can we just get the best of both worlds, why always such a polarize perspective, I just don't get it.
---
The argument there was "use whatever build fits your cosmetic preference". That wasn't a good argument, so yeah, I called it dumb.
---
The comment I linked you was logical and did not call anything dumb.
---
I don't have any idea. But he's really funny to watch hahaha
---
Seems like lazy mods.  Kids with ego trips who can't be bothered to fix problems.
---
You're right but it doesn't make your argument look any better or you if you just go around calling people stupid and dumb.
---
Guilds did that back then also. It was actually really rare that more than a few were even close to ringing the gong.
---
What do you do with the gems from mining?   They take up so much space.
---
In WoW Legion it is revealed that Illidan was pretending to work for the Burning Legion when in reality he was amassing an army of Demon Hunters to defeat the Burning Legion once and for all. He was apparently almost ready to act before he is slain in the TBC expansion. In Legion the goal is to ressurect lllidan as he is the one prophesized to defeat the Legion.
---
Illidan is ressurected and with his help we are able to defeat the Legion for good, and... imprison Sargeras? idk but Illidan stays behind to either kill or guard him it was abiguous to me. Anyway after Illidan finally being outed as a hero the moment you give Malfurion and Tyrande his letters they basically say "Glad that fuck bag is finally gone for good." You can probably youtube it.
---
gameplay i mean in terms of pve/pvp type stuff.
---
&gt;Guild bank is a prime example of significant bad change as it decreases interactions needed between players.
---
this is a joke right? who knew some one could be nostalgic for interaction with a guild officers bank alt.
---
Gotcha thank you.
---
I mean, do you also go to the news station when they're live and smash their desks with a hammer in your free time ?
---
Well chance already said anything he gets from viewers he is putting into the guild bank to help pay for things.
---
&gt; As for PvE Raiding, Undead has no benefits.
---
Not entirely true, they do benefit from the handful of fear mechanic encounters.
---
Don't deflect to "streamer haters" like they're the problem.
---
Sure, he claims he wants a normal player experience.  That's literally impossible and the reason is his own fault.  His streaming is the problem.  Shot himself in the foot and crys about foot pain.
---
I bought a new one when my wife was under for surgery.

My friend wants to play alliance and I wanted to play horde. I decided that on another server I will roll horde and on his server I will roll alliance. Now that I am forced into alliance I was thinking I wanted to play paladin prot/holy. But I also was thinking of rolling druid bear/resto. 
---
I know I won't be raid tanking but I do like tanking with these classes I just cant decide which one.
---
These were probably the most awful mountain dew flavors
---
Good if they’re good, bad if they’re bad.
---
They release Game Fuel Amps, they're really tasty.
---
The problems will recreate themselves if they don't fix the staffing issues.
---
Policy is people.
---
Why do they look like the beginning of a Gorrillaz music video?
---
I see your point, and it’s rational. But after reading through this thread I gotta disagree. I don’t think it will effect steaming numbers when the game is finally released
---
Don‘t get me wrong i enjoyed it. 🙃 even the tauren troll, that felt more classic than everything else lol
---
How about going the other direction (i.e ironforge to menethil without going through the wetlands crocolisk death run?)  Is it possible with strategic dying?
---
I'm sure playing WoW is similar to your analogy.
---
You literally have months on top of moths to prepare for it as well. Probably a year before AQ is even patched in.
---
This was in the old EULA, but it's now been removed. There's literally a potion you can drink in Retail that allows you to comprehend the other faction.
---
Cross faction communication and collusion is completely allowed.
---
The only winning move with sharding/layering in classic is not to play.
---
If I can log onto a Horde character and run to the exact spot a friend is farming pirate mobs in Tanaris and not fight him then what is the point? *That* is why people wanted classic and people played private servers.
---
If it's just going to be a lobby game with queue-to-play just stick to retail.
---
It's not about what I think, but what Blizzard thinks, as they've taken action many times before for griefing, and what you describe is basically griefing. And I also fail to understand how that would interrupt someone farming for rank 14, you can still be in BG queue while dead...
---
Not having this in right away was was probably intended for early Beta builds.  Flight paths in all Betas historically removed nuances of taxis and just railed them with no animations until shortly before final builds and ultimate release. For both Legion and BFA you literally straight-lined to each point, clipping through mountains and all terrain with no animation until about a month before release.
---
So it's BFA
---
I remember engaging with him often while leveling in STV. He was notoriously slow at leveling from what I recall, and took an eternity to reach 60. Still probably the most noteworthy player I remember, aside from Myzery.
---
Raid comps always have 1 Spriest, its just hard to be that Spriest. If you can get on a team and consistently raid as shadow you'll be fine
---
Hes not. I just realized the post saya double thunderfury
---
Was the sarcasm too subtle?
---
Yall have a very different world view then I do. Who can afford to take a month long vacation to Africa? If I take a day off of work, I'm eating ramen to pay rent on time.
---

---
This is incorrect. It's really astonishing how many people do not know this, I am constantly getting invited to groups for drop quests.
---
Well, it is the original 1.12 but 2006 is OLD. It just isn't optimized for the new technology.
---
&gt; these 3 people are not mutally exclusive.
---
No one said they are. I am talking about quantities, not boolean evaluation of existence.
---
&gt;also im saying the majority of people who have a good chance at being top end will be from pservers who have been practicing for years
---
And let's assume you really have a super-hardcore guild on your server (FYI: Most people playing on private servers are not hardcore players. If you wanna know why, go watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmDRt_QwJfU)). Let's further assume, that guild invests a lot of time and resources, that could otherwise go into raid-prep (which is more advantageous to them), in being jerks who want to deny Scarab Lord / Mount to most people.
---
What impact does that have on your, personal, WoW experience?
---
Do you have a realistic Chance of getting Scarab Lord? Not likely. Does the fact that someone else got it make your character weaker, your tradeskills worth less gold, your raid less progressed? No.
---
So please, run it for me, because I am at a loss here: **What exactly is the problem?**
---
he wants his followers to help him, he just wants all the up sides of being able to 'blacklist' players so he cant get killed by the opposite faction, while doing whatever he wants. it'll take about 0.001 seconds for some 'sniper' to kill him when they were actually just playing on a pvp server totally normally, and he'll be pissed off and send his army of neckbeards after them.
---
Rugged *maybe* goes on the AH, if there aren't a lot already listed and it's fetching an OK price. The issue I've found is that it just doesn't sell for a ton and the deposits are so high.
---
Ideally, find a friendly LW who is willing to buy bulk off you, and set up a C.o.D. with them. Ask around in your guild. But there's tons of surplus for leather, so you might still end up vendoring a good bit... Remember sunk cost fallacy, if you're losing money on AH deposits, cut your losses.
---
Def go mage then because the mount only saves you 400ish gold which you'll be fine with since gold farming is so much better as mage.
---
I'll give you my best answer but just so you know, every Wednesday we have a weekly thread for this specific question.
---
All three are great for pvp so I'll just leave that as is!
---
PvE (raiding specifically) Mage will be the best dps out of the three and also brings food, water, buff, and portals to the raid which is all super nice but you are correct it is just a LOT of frostbolt spam
---
Warlocks start off weak but (iirc) they get better once you hit around AQ40, also bring things to the table like summons, healthstones, and soulstones (people like these)
---
Spriests usually only have one spot in a raid, if you get in sweet but if not, that's the nature of the beast. I unfortunately cannot remember much of our spriest so I can't tell you how much they help/don't help raids (sorry!)
---
Lol you know blizzard layed off people but hired even more right after right? They were making so much money that they are out sourcing jobs. 
---
You don’t do that if you’re company is dying.
---
Plot twist: Blizzard names an official server "Nostalrius" in homage.
---
No, but saying someone else shouldn't do something just because you want them to is the exact same entitlement as the one you're against.
---
Nobody is stopping him or anyone else from playing. This is all about self entitlement and attention.
---
He also points out if he dies on a pvp server, he wants that person banned. Maybe a pve server would be best for that..but then says he will grief the hell out of people....how condescending.
---
Remember that funeral that got interrupted? That's classic. Not this carebear "oh we're doing a tournament don't interrupt us" bs.
---
Is water gonna look like retail in classic? Looks like it from that pic
---
&gt; Also why would you ever go for Improved SND when mobs die super fast while leveling.
---
You use improved SND for this exact reason. It's the only thing to spend your combo points on that translates over from one mob to the next.
---
Are you sure you've even played a rogue before? Or the game at all?
---
Troll has the best laugh in the game. Change my mind.
---
Don’t worry. No one in their right mind actually wants new classic content. People would be more pissed about not get TBC.
---
Dude, the red game fuel is amazing with Tito's.
---
they can easily make a character, name it anything that doesnt tie to them. level to 60 in 5 or 6 days and then stream again. 
---
so they wont stream for a week big deal.
---
people will be too busy playing themselves anyway and I'm sure they have mmenough money to get by for a week.
---
a similar risk is taken by guilds who stream progress. not in the form of ganking though that may occur, but theres a good chance someone steals or uses a strategy your are attempting.
---
are you really going with pretending you don't know what he's talking about, lol
---
&gt;Yet across the 10 or so streams I was watching, not a single person reported them or even seemed to consider doing so.
---
They were apparently reported by enough players to have a GM take action, and it was discussed on Staysafe's stream. It seems possible that as you we were swapping between 10 streams you missed some of the discussion on several of them.
---
&gt;One persons corpse caming is another persons "This tauren is ruining our dueling tournament," which is just another persons repeatedly killing named quest mob to deny quest completion. What level of enjoyment are we as players entitled to and what are the bounds of that?
---
I addressed this directly in my post. Killing a mob, regardless of intention, is an intended action within the game, clearly not griefing. Plus, completing quests is optional, thus the disruption is minimal and the player has other avenues to avoid the griefing. A person ruining the competitiveness of a dueling tournament with a decent prize pool being viewed by 125k viewers is literally nothing like your example. 
---
I welcome any other examples that you think break the rules I laid out.
---
Cheetah makes melee weaving easier which is a much bigger damage increase than the little AP that hawk offers.

[Wat?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/007/WAT.jpg)
---
This cant be a serious post.  I refuse to believe it.
---
&gt; But I’ve got a lot more going on now than I did 8 years ago. It’s a struggle
---
I think that's a lot of us now. So many players who started in High school and college are going to come back with Classic. Although now we all have full time jobs and families and shit. I'm expecting a lot of adult, "I have responsibilities" guilds to pop up. I'm totally down to sacrifice a Friday night for a raid.
---
Exactly. He doesn't want to play like normal, he wants to keep making money off his stream while enjoying the gameplay himself. All I can say is, if you don't like getting ganked sometimes don't roll PvP.
---
🤦🏻‍♂️ lol
---
Thanks for the insight - sounds like Alchemist would not be giving up too much individual power so I think I'll be going that route!
---
Uther the Lightbringer is one of my favorite characters and is the character that got me into playing a paladin when I first started playing. One of the most memorable moments for me was in Warcraft 3 the usually calm and forgiving Uther was frothing with Rage as Arthas his pupil returned for his father's ashes. 
---
**Uther the Lightbringer**: *Your father ruled this land for seventy years, and you've ground it to dust in a matter of days.* 
---
**Arthas**: Very dramatic, Uther. Give me the urn, and I'll make sure you die quickly. 
---
**Uther the Lightbringer**: *The  urn holds your father's ashes, Arthas!* ***What, were you hoping to piss on  them one last time*** *before you left his kingdom to rot?* *Arthas chuckles.*
---
**Arthas**: I didn't know what it held. Nor does it matter. I'll take what I came for one way or another. 
---
**Uther the Lightbringer**: *I dearly hope that there's a* ***special place in hell*** *waiting for you, Arthas.*
---
Cross server bgs were in vanilla
---
Those aren't energy drinks. Just being pedantic here.
---
Must be mocking me
---
Playing Alliance is going to be your only chance at ever being a Paladin. I say save the druid for Horde side since the cat form looks way cooler. :)
---
Yes, and they were banned for it. Rightfully so.
---
It was BC -- but I still wouldn't mind it out earlier.
---
So, if I don't watch this guy's stream to be aware of his multiple toon's names, and by chance get to kill him and camp him, I'll get blacklisted by my own faction... nice.
---
The fact that people are still asking why streamers will be detrimental to Classic and/or trying to defend their attitude is laughable
---
Except that corpose camping is not a bannable/suspendable offense. Soooo...?
---
&gt;People actually so filled with hatred of streamers getting beta key
---
this is wrong bruh. people are upset not because streamers got access. but because they seem to have privilege in the fact they have a direct line to blizzard. One streamer did not get access. another streamer begged on stream to blizzard. and that guy was given access. Streamers are putting up click bait bullshit. "world 1st" this or that just to garner views which =more money for them when they run ads. Very few streamers, especially the ones with 30k+ viewers rarely actually submit bugs(which btw is the point of beta test 1st and foremost). The only bugs I've seen reported were ones that directly hindered the streamer in the moment. Whereas the same streamer once told his audience of 50k people to not report a bug at all until the event was over, because the bug helped him win. The bug never went reported, it was forgotten about. When called out. The clips of that event were clean edited to remove the streamer telling his party to not report the bug they were abusing.  
---
If you don't think streamers can ruin a server. Then you don't know the story of ESO. Streamers were let into early beta/launch for same reasons they are given WoW beta. For easy cheap marketing awareness . when the actual launch came around. Every streamer decided to join 1 faction. The Dominion. This left huge population problems in the 1st 5 months of the game's life. when a streamer was about to lose a castle, They would simply show up with 100+ people in tow and lag out the enemy. They were using lag as  a weapon. Mark these words. Someone is going to take a famous streamer name on aug 13th before the game launches. I will bet $1 that the streamer gets that persons name revoked and released for them. watch. It's happened before. history also repeats itself.  
---
That being said. There is a place for streamers in beta. But the obvious nepotism shown towards them will always leave a bad taste. With any industry.
---
I mean it's your funeral.
---
Why would he even accept anything. He can play this game for 16 hours a day. I thought he wants a hard game just like he remembers it back in a day.
---
Because he was named Chance and tweeted out pictures of his character with name on it.
---
&gt;You (Alliance) say ◒ „ Ÿ 10 ƒ ž 1 34 and Horde will read w h a ti s l o ve
---
Game is running 1.12, battlegroups were introduced then so I fully expect battlegroups to be a thing. if you play enough you'll still see plenty of people from your server
---
Skipping SM?
---
Relative to making a new game. Not to mention now that they nailed vanilla, interpreting the BC data is likely even easier.
---
&gt;No, he's saying if you go out of your way to hunt them down. Like the two guys that ruined the pvp tournament did ( went under Stormwind as level 1 Tauren just to intrerrupt the tournament ).  
---
&gt;But if you're going out of your way just to make someone else's experience miserable, you should be shunned anyway, regardless if that other person is a streamer or not. It's just such an asshole thing to do. (an entire guild in vanilla was banned for 7 days for ruining rp events, so it's not that far fetched)
---
this is how we got BFA.
---
We dont even know the servers  and they all arent announcing their servers
---
i'm sure people will try  
---
doubt streamers will announce which server they're picking ahead of the name saving date, or they might get name sniped. so people will most likely need to wait till after that.
---
Yup definitely salty about streamers right here.
---
Yeah. Apple is the "I Am Rich" scam of computers.
---
I loved the blue, in fact it is out now under the "Liberty Flavor" for July 4th in America -- It is stated as having "All 50 flavors" but it is exactly as I remember the Alliance Blue
---
I’m having a hard time choosing between Shaman and Warlock. I plan to raid enough to gear up but i will mainly do wpvp and BGs.
---
I’ve been told SL is great at pvp but not so much in wpvp ? What about shaman?
---
A game that can be played multiple ways? A game that rewards time investment no matter which route you go? *gasp* better just remove the AH.
---
Sadly no one ever mentions Maraudon. One of my favorite dungeons personally, a pain in the ass to get to though (as alliance anyways).
---
Are you trolling? Getting gold costs time, it is the choice of the player. mmoRPg, play it as you like. If you want to raid go raid. If you want to farm gold, farm gold.
---
I mean you are absolutely right about that. All that being said. You can still be black listed from all the best guilds on your server. Blizzard isn't going to help you with that. So if your plan is to level up on a server with the intention of getting yourself black listed. Good luck with that fam.
---
Yes plz. Or something for the day
---
He's streaming because that's his hobby, it's his fucking job now. He doesn't ask for people to follow him around like mentally retarded children, but they do. It's not his fault that people are like that.
---
[You may wanna look into this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here_have_some_upscaled_highresolution_wow_maps/), someone used a program to upscale and denoise my image. It looks insanely good!
---
this is the dumbest post I've seen today and thats saying a lot
---
He wouldn’t. I just said he would give everything to the gbank.  You can’t just stop thousands of people trying to give you things. Especially if you make a big deal about it, they will come even stronger.
---
/r/wowcirclejerk is that way
---
I generally won't gank a female dwarf priest with the assumption that most of them are pretty chill and will leave me alone if given the same opportunity.
---
Is this assumption fairly accurate?
---
How could a guild do it?
---
How are you gonna just run around here and suggest that Apple knows the market and what potential customers want?
---
&gt; Why should people who have gold and camp the Auction House have access to gear that's nearly as good as the first drops in Molten Core?
---
The first drops in Molten Core ARE BoE silly. Guilds that couldn't kill a boss used to farm the trash for them.
---
There are very few world drop Epics that compare to gear available in MC and Onyxia. What you're speculating simply doesn't happen.
---
Didn't we have battlegroup cross realm PvP at the end of Vanilla? Clusters of 3 or so servers would play in the same BGs, so technically you did play against the same people all the time.
---
The weird thing about the automod against certain pserver names actually causes more damage than it would prevent too. 
---
Take the LH example, someone may comment on the location in the Eastern Plaguelands in reference to some legitimate discussing about the town/area, only to have there post locked/removed. 
---
This would lead to them wonder why, since they didn't do anything wrong intentionally. Then they would discover that pservers are a thing and that LH is one of them. Now the automod has actually guided this previously unknowing individual to know that pservers are a thing and that LH is one of them.
---
It's an awful rule that should be handled way better than an automod on keywords/phrases.
---
Would I be surprised if a guild tried to pull it off? No.
---
Do I think a guild will attempt it? No.
---
Not to mention anybody have any experience with what x-server BGs did to the rank grind. With slower queues it seems like it put a practical limit on how much a person could grind. X-server means you can basically pvp 24/7. It seems like this would have a net effect of making the grind even worse?
---
It is absolutely allowed in the EULA now. But that doesn't mean its good for Classic. I personally will stick to using emotes like /sorry to express myself
---
Streaming is his job, maybe retards just shouldn't follow him around ?
---
No they shouldn't.
---
&gt;Why should people who have gold and camp the Auction House have access to gear that's nearly as good as the first drops in Molten Core? 
---
Why should crybabies who can't deal with the fact that some people put more effort into the game than they do, get their way? Because that worked so well in retail?
---
&gt;You can pretty much get geared in sweet purples without setting foot in a RAID40 group. 
---
#No, you cannot.
---
There are literally just 5-6 world epics in Vanilla that are even useful at lvl 60.
---
You can make characters August 12th, until then I doubt anyone will know
---
you mean like Dvorak? Tried it once, didn't work for me...
---
For the AQ post?  Your reasoning there makes sense.  I don't think they will change it, but I understand where you are coming from
---
No i'm gonna go with asking if he's alright because only a mentally ill person would make all those weird reaches. Thankfully they're more reasonable in other posts. 
---
You doing okay bud?
---
Because the gear you will need enough +hit on your farming gear, and the target will dodge less...which is the point in farming. 
---
Also, your Shield Slam will be the main damage generator.
---
So, it doesn't make much sense in spending 1 or 2 talent point in Improved Overpower, when the target will rarely dodge and when your main damage ability is Shield Slam.
---
As a 17/3/31 spec, you don't put any points in Imp. Overpower. Put a point in Improved Charge instead, because you will charge pretty much every 10 seconds.
---
What you want is enough +hit, so your Shield Slam can hit most of the times, and as much crit as possible, so that Shield Slam hit will crit as often as possible.
---
1. No i didn't know that. I don't know anything about blender (the software i used) or paint as i havnt used either before.
---
2. You're comparing this to a quiz without any speaking and is a music quiz. The format isnt even the same.
---
My aim was not to have people just read the screen, but also to listen to me read it out. Thats why i didn't put effort into the presentation. I don't know how to even make moving pictures in any software, thats why there is no gifs, no videos, no anything in this.
---
I'm completely new to this, and want to give it a shot. I will look into why my microphone has such shit quality, however i feel as though your other points are somewhat invalid, as those are not what my video is intending to accomplish. The English is fine. "*How is this Zone displayed on the (world) map?"* I do specify world map in the voice over, and it is clearly circling the zone. so to put it simply "How is this circled zone displayed on the world map" is what the question is essentially, but i would assume most people would get that.
---
False. The lack of cross realm BGs will kill the PVP community because they'll be waiting all day for a queue to pop.
---
A true statement, but an equally true statement is that for most of Vanilla they were not.
---
Since it’s 1.12 and people have been conditioned to fast queues through the “lobby” style of matchmaking seen in most games today, Blizz doesn’t really have a choice. Cross-realm will be in the game, but OP is right in saying that there will be substantial drawbacks.
---
Classic wow disagrees with you strongly. PvE was way easier in classic than it was in any other version of the game. Community gave soul to the game. Anonymity due to LFG and LFR killed
---
The game
---
Playing as a cat and actually getting face to face with the enemy just feels so much more rewarding than AoE farming in a mechanical fashion. I would main the droood.
---
Wotlk released 2008

---
What companies are these and what innovative, risky ideas that are wildly different are they doing with MMORPGs? Not SP RPGs, not Survival games, not FPS, actual MMORPGs.
---
I used to love FFXIV, but it's mostly a WoW skin with too much forced story. SWTOR has Tell Tale-esque story options, but is also a reskinned WoW, hotkey MMORPG at the end of the day. GW2 took some inspiration from MOBAs with their hotbar and run a hybrid action/hotkey combat system, but nothing really far out there. 
---
There are also like 30 different Korean MMORPGs with varying levels of budgets from indie to AAA, but they all run the exact same RNG upgrade systems on weapons and armor. The same endless grind systems in quests. Mostly PvP-focused etc.
---
I'm not saying there aren't some out there, which is why I asked the question, but how big are they? They 20th biggest MMORPG? The 30th? The 40th? This is why companies like Blizzard, SE, EA etc. aren't taking any risks. It's not profitable anymore. The first decade of a new genre is where innovation comes from, after that it's all about streamlining and marketing. RIP.
---
Why is it only 400ish?
---
What is this image originally from, seems like an 80s show I should know?

No one can see your gear, which is probably a good thing since mage sets look like ass.

okay..

True as hell.

Imagine if I didn't know what LHC was, I'd go down a rabbit hole of finding out why my stuff was getting caught in the mod filter. It would me right to it. 
---
Luckily I already am on a steady psrv I like, but I know many who may not know and it's not my place to tell them.
---
Automod esesentially advertises it to them.
---
good point, good point for sure. I didn't consider that they are from KT.
---
the thing about "  But he warned me that playing mage means spamming frostbolt and that's it. " alot of classes have simple rotations, its still not about that. They are all simple but still req skill to handle, even if you just "1 spell" in PVE.  
---
**Warlock** is fun, but soulshard management is a hassle, haveing to farm 40+ before each raid, so you can summon lazy people and so tanks can eat your healthstones like cookies. And then we have the threat issues.  
---
**Shadow Priest**, is meh. Bad DPS and you go OOM. They might aswell take a disc with shadowweaveing in raids.  
---
**Mage** is fun in vanilla, even if the rotation is basic, so what, mage life is spoiled in vanilla.  
---
PVP is a diffrent story, here all 3 classes you all their arsenal and its high skillcap. All 3 is very fun in pvp. They have diffrent "jobs" in a premade enviroment thou. **SP** and **Lock** are defending. **Mage** can fill most "Jobs"
---
&gt;If I wanted fast, easy access, quick queues I'd play BFA
---
Cross realm pvp was introduced in 1.12.
---
People in vanilla didn't want to wait.  Its got nothing to do with retail.
---
So this dude thinks he god and decide who kill him will not get raids.. bullshit, blizz ban soda

I converted from Android to iPhone in the last year or two, can't remember specifically. With installment payments and jump/upgrade plans, it hardly matters what the cost of the phone is anymore.

Plus, I mean, I'll trust Apple over Google for privacy and security any day.
---
This post again
---
Thank you, sorry for not following the weekly thread. I'll evaluate my decisions as I still have 3 months to decide.
---
Focus isnt in Classic.   just an FYI, (but I have zero horse in this race, pvp is not my jam at all)
---
Again the insults don't help. I don't get it because you're spamming sinsiter strike anyways most of the time and evicerating and things die pretty fast, SND isn't going to offer much but just some extra white hits when they're going to die to your evis anyways.
---
Stop fighting on the roads
---
Wouldn't that make brown or purple though? Dew is green that doesn't work man!! COME ON!!!
---
 Back in 2005/6 I was selling my arcanite transmute for 4-6g. This was on an established server with a mature economy. I can't remember what the bars were going for.
---
On a certain server that rhymes with Dwight's Rope, I was selling my transmute for about the same 4-6g and the bars varied greatly (from about 16g to 30g) depending on the price of arcane crystals.
---
My other comment got deleted apparently.
---
The squarming of the fanboys is actually even more funnier to watch.
---
The original loot box...
---
The audacity of this snowflake. If you streamsnipe I will get the other faction streamers to shun you...whaah.
---
What people should do is get on their servers, both factions, form two guilds that work together to constantly streamsnipe tools like this. What is he going to do? Tell his Alliance buddies to ostracize those players? What will they care they have their own guild of people who thumb their noses at these guys and raid on their own and sometimes for shits and giggles they camp douchebags like this for hours.
---
 Call it the Streamsnipe Mafia and make it your goal to troll these guys.
---
Don't get me wrong I watch streamers (Kargoz, MadSeason) but they aren't some mousepad bully dictating how other people will play the game or be punished.
---
Apple fan boys will never give an inch. People arent mad because its too expensive for them. They are mad because 1000 dollars on a monitor stand is retarded.
---
Agreeing with OP here. BGs felt way different from 1.12 onwards. Queues were faster, but quantity of games != quality of games.
---
love the chikfila name =P

If people are upset "because they seem to have privilege in the fact they have a direct line to blizzard", why don't you just start streaming and make yourself noticed so that you can have a direct line to blizzard ?

This isn't "nepotism" or whatever you want to call it (lmao), this is free advertisement. Of course Blizzard wouldn't care about you, but the guy with millions of people following him. If you had millions of people following you, you would've been treated the same, it's not easy to get there.
---
I've seen people who roll a lock as their main always love their class. From what I gather from the private servers I have played on, Horde is going to need more locks.
---
Feral druid is nice but at least with a lock, you'll never have the stigma of being requested to heal for end-game. Both will kick ass in Alterac Valley.

GOD I AM SO FED UP WITH THOSE "WHATS AFTER NAX" THREADS

IT'S LIKE ASKING

---
They've shown, for about 3 years now, that they're listening to what we say and then saying "No, no, this is what you'll enjoy and you'll like it. We're right, you're wrong. Sit down and shut up."

Did you play BfA? Did you read any of the AMA's after that shit show?

"We know doing this goes against the entire reason and concept of this server. We know people don't want it because it sucks. We're doing it anyway. Fuck you."

That's Ion's entire philosophy.
---
Great job on the handwriting, OP!
---
Stop
---
I hope so all the stuff being posted with streamers is really making me want to avoid them
---
I see why killing a whiny kid on stream is a big attraction, I really do. I won't personally do that but I do hope he gets f***** in the a** by streamsnipers. Normally I wouldnt wish it on a streamer, but hes a big exception.
---
I'd be fucking stoked if they did.
---
&gt; My aim was not to have people just read the screen, but also to listen to me read it out.
---
And you thought having a video where the electric noise is louder than your voice is advantageous in this regard because...?
---
I was almost exclusively PvP but I know raids usually wanted two or three rogues.
---
I'm witnessing the hamstering with my own eyes!
---
No worries at all, just wanted to give you the info! Best of luck!
---
Type /whoa on an orc in retail to get your mind blown.
---
Yea very true, it would be nice not having them cross realm but I feel like it would suck for certain realms if you have a population imbalance or all the good pvpers being on one faction.
---
.... because the market for Professional-grade monitors already exists
---
Yeah, a majority of the big streamers have expressed their intention to hide their chosen realm until launch. By then, most of us will have chosen a realm in the 2 weeks prior.
---
Just when I think, "Meh Classic might not be all I hope it will, I'm 12 years older and life has changed, I dunno we'll see"...I see things like this. I'm not even entirely sure what it is. Maybe it's a proper massage to my nostalgia-region since it's literally the original game. It does seem like it looks better than I remember it being.
---
You know, on a lark I played, for the first time, Skyrim Special Edition on PC. I played the crap out of the original years ago and didn't care about the graphical update. As it turns out, it looks shockingly good and has been a lot of fun to play again. 
---
I'm hoping Classic will be the same way. And hopefully we can get some RPPvP servers to make it even better.
---
skullflame shield BoE epic better than anything that's gonna be in phase 1. it's not fair.
---
To me it sounds like a mage will be the most universal role. I consider myself a nice person and provide food and water to strangers would be very satisfying for me.
---
I didn't say he can't do something, he just has to not be a man child and expect me to smash his face in the mud for amusement, the game is War Craft.
---
Making an analogy about ganking someone to breaking and entering, destroying private property, and otherwise commit a crime is beyond ridiculous and has nothing to do with entitlement.
---
Most streamers have pledged to keep their chosen realm a secret until Launch. You won't know on August 12th.
---
“Casual! I can’t stop at almost 50, I need to hit 60!”

Incoming autistic screeching how vanilla was perfect and should remain identical
---
Great
---
Motherfuckers act like they forgot about DKP. 
---
People didn't just automatically get loot every time they raided. I watched countless items go to others this way, despite needing the gear just as much if not more than they did. 
---
I raided both games. I had more fun with a smaller raiding guild in TBC than I did in vanilla. Truth. If anything I just got what I was there to earn rather than building silly fake points so someone with no life could get the gear before me with my subservient help.
---
What would the lowbie killed repeatedly in town and then corpse camped trying to turn in a quest say about the unavoidable and spirit of the game qualifiers though? Say I am in a low level zone (1-10) and someone max level from the opposite faction comes in, kills all the npcs, kills me, then camps me. What then? 
---
Come in and kill the npcs, ok that's faction fantasy. Kill me while I'm there, ok, that too. But to do it over and over and over? That's griefing IMO. It is abusing game mechanics to deny others the ability to play. 
---
("Go somewhere else" folks may reply. How if I can't revive and run away? What if all of my quests are done and I need to turn them into an area that is being camped? If the only option is to log off and wait for them to leave, that is 100% griefing.)
---
You are compleltly wrong and your attitude against people who had fun in their favourite game on private servers (the only reason they did that is because it wasnt available) speaks for itself.
---
I, and most people I know, remember classic as a hard as fuck game. Thats mainly because we didnt know what we were doing.  I am not even talking about boss mechanics, I am talking about everything. If your tank and healer are literal kids the game was fucking hard. Nowdays if you know what you are doing its a cakewalk. It definatly wasnt 15 years ago when I was 13 and had never played an MMO before. This is  true for many people. Even after I knew what I persoanlly was doing getting a pug group for UBRS was hard as fuck to manage. If you were in an organized guild of adults yes it wasnt that hard but for many many people it was. 
---
Stop beeing so negative. I never understood why people hate the pserver community so much, they just love the game same as you.
---
Careful with the initials of a pserver. You may face a ban to.
---
&gt;  We want a real game, something we play because we want to play it, not because shiny-blinky shit pops up on our screen every few minutes.

Good luck playing casual/solo in bgs without cross-realm.

Did this timer apply to being resurrected by other people?
---
This guy does not have the intelligence to make such a persona, he clearly has a "Letter" in his medical book.
---
we'll see. someone will leak it I bet as they'll likely try to be on the same server
---
But it's just *armor*.
---
Protecting the open secret of private servers is more important than discussion these parts of classic. We can't leave ourselves open to the accusation that we're making it easy to find pservers -- so long as we don't mention their names here, interested people will have almost no way to discover them.
---
They won't.

I'd be willing to wait 20 minutes for a queue while questing to match up against familiar names, people I've built a rivalry with
---
If there's Alliance on the other side, there's my rivalry. They don't have to be on my server. Plus I love faster bg pops.
---
Warrior has no speed increasing abilities, no healing and a very limited toolkit to deal with adds. This applies to solo leveling of course, with a healer warrior becomes a beast. 
---
While leveling you don't need to respec that much, your choice of Arms or Fury will be good enough for tanking any dungeons. You really only need prot at level 60 and only if you're filling a dedicated tank role in a guild. I used to run as a Mortal Strike warrior with the crit from fury and rest in prot. That allowed me to PvP and off tank in early raids. Of course the build was crap at PvP, you really want the 20 in Fury for that and Arms Prot is a complete joke as a raid dps. 
---
I've heard of Fury Prot builds that allow for both dps and tank roles, I have no experience with those. On pservers top guilds are running Fury Prot even as main tanks because they can generate a lot more threat to allow the raid go ham with dps. 
---
I hope any of this helps.
---
Or does he just have you fooled because you take his on camera behavior at face value?
---
It's not his fault he chose to stream for a living and it's affecting his gaming experience?  Wtf are you smoking?  Literally every bit of it was his decision.
---
The soft cap is 315. Cuz level 63 mobs (all raid bosses) have 315 defense rating 
---
Once you pass the foes defense rating there is a severe drop off
---
I would still take that point, the value gained elsewhere will not outweigh the “reduced” benefit of more Weapon Skill
---
I'm not sure you're reading what i've replied with, that or you're chosing to ignore it.  *"I will look into why my microphone has such shit quality"* meaning i do not know why it is doing this. It doesn't do it when speaking to people through discord so its odd it would do it on a voice recording, however you can still hear my voice clearly through the static in the background. I'm not trying to have an argument, you're acting as though you expect me to know what i'm doing and how to do everything in regards to video making even through i have already stated i haven't a clue.
---
Preach is good. Seems like a genuine guy.
---
I wasn't debating, I'm in agreement. Clearly I flopped on my attempt to be sarcastic with the "What, company X isn't dumb?!" sort of thing.
---
We downvoting boys?
---
I don't know I like the cost of respecing being high, forces more of an identity on you, really makes you think before bouncing from spec to spec
---
Agreed, I've been listening for a while now and that segment was dreadful. Full of fallacies, "slippery slopes" and false equivalence. Luckily it was short.
---
Spitting and laughing doesn't have the same impact when you are the one dying, but that is what you get for choosing Alliance, I suppose.
---
Stop whining. Go farm some gold.
---
he did tho because you talk to uther in the halls of reflection
---
Can you please shut up, seriously. You're taking the word "hardmode" literally like a 5 year old kid. Hardmode in context of Ulduar refers to a special, harder fight that you somehow trigger **and where you get better loot as a result**. Do Kolo, Razor and so on drop any additional loot when you do the achievement tactics? No, they don't. It is not a "hardmode", it's just doing something different for an achievement, which almost any raidboss has.

Relatively harmless stuff like that is fun. Corpse camping isn't really fun IMO

Lucky you didnt get banned though. People have been banned just for including those two words in the same post.
---
StormX is the reason why I will be playing druid. He has proven that you can literally be half decent at the game and crush people as any hybrid spec. You can gear up resto at 60 and as feral and have enough gear for a solid balance resto hybrid spec in pvp. And, when the time comes to be FC in phase 3 you'll have enough gear from feral to form a formitable FC feral/resto druid.
---
StormX proved this and makes any druid spec viable.
---
Not having cross-realm bgs will result in even bigger and worse drawbacks.
---
Sl is not particularly great it’s just very hard to kill. Extremely tanky but almost equally useless outside of duels. Most locks won’t go sl In organized pvp.
---
The issue that I have with your whole premise is that everything you considered "griefing" and everything you considered "non-griefing" can be argued either way. Especially considering that Blizzard does not have clear guidelines as to what they consider griefing to be outside of a vague statement. By that vague statement, getting corpose camped "ruins" my gameplay experience. And to counter point the Tauren "ruining" the duel tournament I again point out that literally everything he was doing was dodgeable had they just adpated to the situation at hand. This feels like a mob and not an actual acknowledgement of what was happening.
---
If any type of punishment happened to that player, it was a mistake, in my opinion. Denying his interaction within the tournament was very doable. Players like Soda displayed their screens after they arrived to new locations, giving this player time to also travel there. They could have gone to any number of places with higher level mobs that weren't neutral areas which would have prevented a level 1 character from accessing those areas. As I mentioned before, knowing who you were dueling next gave you opportunities to create macros specifically for that player, thereby ignoring the fact that any other player was in the area. 
---
I am not saying that this player wasn't annoying, but in terms of actual impact on the server, or players... their actions are being blown way out of porportion because of viewer count and not because they did something that actually ruined gameplay like killing quest NPCs repeatedly.
---
He makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year streaming if not millions. He doesn't really care that much about the authenticate experience, certainly not the point where not streaming the game would make any sense.

"Play world of warcraft."

"Give us your money."

Not to mention saving all the gold you'd be spending on the overpriced consumables while leveling!
---
Mining is terrible for Alchemy, so I'll be getting Herbalism.
---
Right. Idk sometimes its obvious that certain posts are trolls of other posts. This one less so
---
It made you choices mean something, similar to Diablo but I'm sure you would cry about that too
---
Looking forward to get this guide, for all the classes. This is really cool
---
are they leveling solo or in groups? i feel like you can be in whites and do fine if you're in a group so it kind of negates the challenge a bit
---
Let me start by saying. You wanted this. Vanilla in it's original format. So you got it. Don't like some things in vanilla? Well that sucks. I don't want to change the Respec cost because that's how it was in vanilla and I never got to play vanilla. Part of the reason vanilla is so touted about for being amazing is how hard it was for various reasons.
---
The gold cost on respecting is one of the reasons. It made talent choice meaningful. Much much more than it does today or even in wrath. So no it should change even to 25 gold.
---
No, before it was patched, TF could proc off of ranged attacks. So, it was a decent weapon for hunters.  
---
Now, though, we know that it will ultimately end up getting changed so it'll be a total waste giving it to a hunter.
---
thunderfury requires quite a bit besides just being there when it drops. Because it doesn't drop. 1 of 2 items that drop start the quest. You need both items. Plus some expensive mats to make it. The reason GM's usually get it 1st. Is because usually the GM is the MT. The MT of a serious guild should give Thunderfury to the main tank. It's a chain lighting debuff that does dmg. Which means easier for MT to hold agro. More agro=better raid results usually.  
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is the reward from the quest Rise, Thunderfury!. It is the culmination of a challenging and very expensive quest chain.
---
1. 📷 \[60\] Examine the Vessel
---
2. 📷 \[60R\] Thunderaan the Windseeker
---
3. 📷 \[60\] Rise, Thunderfury!
---
The quest chain begins when you loot the Left or the Right half of the \[Bindings of the Windseeker\], which drop off Baron Geddon and Garr respectively, in [Molten Core](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Core). Upon looting either of these, you must travel to Silithus and talk with [Highlord Demitrian](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Highlord_Demitrian). He will give you the \[Vessel of Rebirth\] which starts the quest chain.
---
The next quest requires you to present the following items to Demitrian:
---
* both left and right halves of the \[Bindings of the Windseeker\]
---
* \[Essence of the Firelord\] - a 100% drop, assuming one has the quest, from Ragnaros, final boss of [Molten Core](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Core)
---
* 10x \[Elementium Bar\] - each bar requires 1 [\[Elementium Ore\]](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Elementium_Ingot) (from [Blackwing Lair](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Blackwing_Lair)), 1 [\[Fiery Core\]](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fiery_Core), 10 [\[Arcanite Bar\]](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanite_Bar), and 3 \[Elemental Flux\].
---
Bring a raid with you when you return with the required items to Demitrian because he will summon Thunderaan, who promptly attacks you. Upon defeating Thunderaan, you receive a \[Dormant Wind Kissed Blade\]. Deliver this to (the now rather cowed) Highlord, and he will make Thunderfury for you.
---

That is essentially what players "hunting" streamers are doing. They are camping them over and over. Just because there's an audience doesn't change what the offense is.
---
I know that feel and then by some miracle this morning I was invited to the beta!
---
I played vanilla thru tbc and never had an issue with the respec cost. I played a mage and bounced around specs a fair amount. I leveled fire, pvp'd with pom/pyro, and raided with frost. Your facts you present tho bother me a bit. Yes more than 0% of people dont respec because of the cost but even if the cost was 1g some cheap asshole would still choose not to respec. It is important to have gold sinks unless you want inflation to be worse than it already was at the end of tbc. At least when this was live the infliction was mitigated by new content. If classic is locked into classic it becomes even more important to have a cash sink.
---
Again, it never bothered me to drop some gold to try a diff spec tho maybe I'm just not a whiney bitch
---
&gt; Luke Skywalker had to organize a 40 man raid to confront Darth Vader? No. 
---
I vaguely remember a rebel army attacking the Death Star. ;)
---
Didn't know that! Thanks!
---
Why make ANOTHER topic about this? Why not voice your ideas in all the other thousands of topics about this?
---
&gt; Anyone that tries to argue that it should be 50g because it's a great gold sink is an idiot. Anyone that says a lower cost makes the game easier is fucking retarded.
---
This is a great starting point for any productive discussion.
---
Yup, I used a viewport so that I could have my unit frames/meters/etc. not be overlapping the actual gameplay.
---
I just realized I only did 3/5 Defiance. I thought I had way too many points to play with for some reason.
---
Getting to 305 is the priority, after that, every point in weapon skill from 305 to 312 is the same. Once you pass 312, you hit the hard cap on glancing blow reductions.
---
Once you get Maladath, you take the extra point out of Weapon Expertise and put it in Improved Poisons.
---
&gt;skullflame shield BoE epic pretty much better than anything that's gonna be in phase 1
---
[Draconian Deflector](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=12602). Same fire resistance, has Stamina, increases defense rating. Pretty much better for every Raid encounter in MC. Drops of Drakkisath in UBRS.
---
And even if you were telling the truth: **THAT IS ONE ITEM!**  
---
There are 16 character slots to fill for a deftank. How does one item constitute _" pretty much get geared in sweet purples "_, please explain?
---
&gt;it's not fair.
---
What exactly is not fair about it? Someone has to find the item. That someone has to put it up. Someone else has to put in ALOT of work and time to get the gold to buy it.
---
You are complaining that guilds that invest time and effort didn't get it, but someone else, who also put in time and effort got it.
---
That's not unfair, it's perfectly fair.
---
You ignored my question
---
They have been absolute shit in so many areas, yes.

Hey, I'm between dwarf paladin or dwarf priest. I'm looking to do alot of dungeons, be that guy that boosts people through dungeons get some real networking in since I'd like to go through every raid but have never raided before. Which would be a better pick and was wondering since I'm working nights (get off at around 12 cst) it I would be better off playing eu or na. Thanks in advance.
---
Maybe I am thinking their Halo editions then
---
Yeah cant agree there Uther had not seen people becoming zombies. Why would any sane person agree to butchering people in their sleep on the “chance” theyll turn? 
---
Someone who didnt go insane would have attacked Malganis directly and dealt with the populace afterwards when they were no longer still human. Cant blame Uther and Jaina for not wanting to kill innocent people even for the “greater good”
---
He never said that you can't kill him, don't try to strawman a crap argument. He said if people follow streamers around intentionally disrupting their gameplay they should be blacklisted, which is a thing that also existed in vanilla, and it was even worse. If you want to follow a specific player around both continents and do it for hours on end, then yes, you should be blacklisted or even banned, that should be unacceptable behavior regardless if the other person is streaming or not.
---
It's not 20 minutes dude. Some realms had to wait 4 days for an AV queue.
---
dude, you hit the nail on the head here. people don't realize that if youre decent at pvp and you roll druid youre unstoppable. You might not always close out on kills FAST but if you play it smart you can do virtually everyyyyyything. you are truly a god of pvp as a hybrid.
---
Regarding damage output*
---
I too would like to know this, cheers
---
but it's made by **APPLE.**
---
Healing? As paladins aren’t the best tanks or DPS. I’d go dwarf priest. Fear ward is so valuable and can get you in raid spots.
---
Is that based on what you experienced on pserver [or what's come out of beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwpyjv/what_the_new_knowledge_about_weapon_skill_means/)?
---
lol nah bro too busy playing DOTA 2. not gonna level a character that just gets deleted in August
---
No, they aren't just corpse camping them, they are following them around both continents at every hour of the day while they are online.
---
Take those polls with a huge grain of salt. The vast majority of people rolling warrior will quit before 40. And the remaining ones who reach 60 with either main arms for PvP or want to DPS. The remaining that want to tank will still be highly sought after
---
at 1-10 it's avoidable by not flagging for pvp. Someone killing quest givers is unavoidable, but the game has dishonorable kills. There's also other players that can come help.
---
I, too, remember when choices had consequences in RPGs and identity meant something.
---
Now we have BFA.

I like the 50g respec cost. Makes me feel like a MAN when I respec. I will respec 2-6 times/week on my Shaman.

Is this were Kek originated

would welcome it.
---
The social aspect of this event was huge on my server.
---
If you think that 1/16 constitutes "pretty much", then I pity everyone who ever has to sit in a car with you, when you will discover, in the middle of some desert highway, that 1/16th of a tank of gas does not give you "pretty much" the reach of a full tank.

Lol no he was never a fanatic. He fought for Lodearon against her enemies that is all. This is way before there were any sentient forsaken or “normal” orcs
---
The entire war effort needs 3,237,000 individual items turned in. The most bag slots you can get on a characters is 242 (or 308 if you are focusing on Herb bags), which is backpack slots + bank slots + 4\*player bags + 7\*bank bags. To store all the mats needed, it would require 13,205 characters.  Since there was a limit of 10 characters per realm, that would require 1321 accounts that do nothing but store mats, or roughly 20k a month in sub fees.
---
Because you can be either one of the two groups.
---
Call both sides of the arguments insults, that's a good way to get the votes!
---
I’m sure you’re not suggesting no one gets ahead? It’s crowded at first yes, but it isn’t impossible. I’ve seen people use a mob tagging strategy where they have a friend make a level 1 hunter that gets to like level 3 and follows them around helping them kill mobs. I’m also not really sure how the sharding/layering thing is going to effect things either.
---
ehhhh true and false. Number 5. : you can certainly become a God in world pvp as a balance resto hybrid. But thats for the first two phases. Once bgs come out you will probably want to be fc feral/resto spec.
---
Reeeeeee
---
It's been a while, but aren't the very earliest starting zones flagged off for pvp even on pvp servers? But regardless your point is fair even if it was level 10-20. 
---
My defense according to the rules above would be: a reasonable strategy in a war would be preventing the other side from getting stronger and you need to call in your side to help defend you. Which in my experience is exactly what happened when there was mass griefing of lowbie zones. And if this type of experience just isn't for you, there are always pve servers.
---
Personally I don't love egregious griefing. I don't do it. But I am always going to lean libertarian on the issue, as long as there is some defense of the actions within the game systems as they were intended. Pure abuse outside of the realm of the intentions of the game are what need policing.
---
Also, why no Improved Sunder Armor?
---
You can't target enemy totems with a macro on the beta. (You can /tar friendly totems though)
---
I guess but then why not Sword Spec because that can help you have an extra attack off of your white hits and with SND that's a lot of extra white hits.
---
Spotted the angry atheist
---
Being a lowbie and seeing high level players fly over on their way to yet unseen lands was such a driving force in levelling.
---
Jokes on you, OP is a Paladin.
---
icwatudidthare :P  
---
Also, a Tauren Warrior was my very first character that I ever created. They look so badass decked out in plate with a big ol' weapon.
---
&gt; pservers are cesspools, filled with people craving a feeling of entitlement
---
Those people are going to play Classic and it takes only one asshole out of a community to ruin it for everyone else.
---
How will we download the game before that date?
---
that's why they made the hearthstone
---
1 year is a long time. You can make plenty of alts in that time
---
Jist 40 people with the 16 slot crafted bag on max amount of alts can have 27k slots
---
Then there is banks an additonal 140 for a total of 44800 additional
---
We are at almost 72k without mail tricks (mail can sit for 30 days and players can essentially juggle around all those mats
---
Vanilla isnt amazing. Tbc and wotlk were better games.
---
Fact is most here just urn for youth not wow classic.
---
Could you provide a source?  The information that I have read would disagree with that.
---
305 skill looks like the soft cap for hit/crit/parry/block.  There is no hard cap.
---
It was always assumed that 310 was a hard cap for glancing blows.  I'm now seeing a lot of 308 talked about, but I'm still waiting to see some data on that.
---
50g respec means that if that T2 rogue wants to rock me in AV with sub daggers then he's going to have to spend some money, because he ain't raiding with that build. Meanwhile the dedicated PVP rogue who never needs to spec combat doesn't need to spend that money to get his PVP gear.
---
Thanks, you too!
---
Well it was also for the misc rep grinds, but I honestly don't remember what the rep rewards were or whether they were actually important.
---
BC had the helm glyphs and other stuff.
---
Write one for mages!
---
Streamer blacklists existed in vanilla, ummm no.
---
Disruping gameplay was worse in vanilla, ummm how do you figure that?  Also, you call killing in a war game disruptive which is strange.
---
You think I should be banned for stream sniping.  That's some comical shit friend.  Really funny stuff.  I can see why we don't agree now.
---
Great podcast!
---
Correct about Freya. Thorim's "wife", actually a Yogg tentacle. Yogg became a lot more difficult since you lost powerful buffs from the watchers, and the ads in 3rd phase became unkillable.
---
lol you're an idiot if you don't think an autism streamers' army of incel fuckwits arent going to harass anyone for killing their supreme virgin overlord, regardless if it's a stream snipe or genuine random kill. I don't think you understand how these little retards think
---
Indie games are getting better every year. It's the "AAA" titles that have devolved.
---
Hopefully it’s the overwatch team that developed their matchmaking system
---
I was going to ask "male or female" then I realized that they're both the best
---
‘Grand Theft Kodo’ was seen often too
---
jobs come with pros and cons. The cons of being a high profile streamer is that there's people who want to fuck with him. He doesn't HAVE to be a streamer. This is like saying celebrities who don't like their picture taken in public should be protected. Nah, being famous is part of the gig. If they don't want the downsides they shouldn't have struggled to get so famous.
---
Stop hating on Payo you inbred fucks. He is to be treasured
---
asmongold should have been the bald elf but otherwise good effort. esfand looks about right
---
Game is running 1.12, Naxx, Dungeon Set 2 questlines, Nightmare Dragons etc. were introduced by then so I fully expect them to be a thing.  
---
Does not a good argument make.  
---
Items are being introduced in cycles roughly equal to when they were introduced in their original patches, so is content like raids, world bosses and BGs themselves, and following that trend - so should Xrealm BGs, which would put them roughly in phase 6.
---
Both.
---
The only thing we didn't know before Blizzard clarified the Vanilla hitcap is *why* the hitcap was closer to 9% than 8%. We've still always known exactly what 305 weapon skill gives you and what every point after gives you.
---
That post you linked is wrong. He says it's a 8% chance to miss. It's not. And then he goes on to be more wrong.
---
I played a warrior since beta of vanilla wow and want to play something different. I enjoy big weapons and horde. I don't have the same amount of time to play as I used to so I don't expect to be raiding that much and will be solo most of leveling. 
---
You think I would enjoy a shaman? I've played a boosted one for a few hours at lvl100 but that's it. Would I be viable in BG's late gameplay/casual raiding? It's been so long and I used to only tank raids so I don't remember the meta of other classes for the current classic patch.
---
I lived through vanilla and I am of the opinion that the gold cost was supposed to hurt to keep you from changing your spec.  The original idea was that we weren't supposed to be changing our specs to go and do different things.  If you were a fury warrior that's what you were supposed to be doing not go to SW and spec Prot to make the next raid.  
---
We were supposed to play the characters that we chose and you are wanting to play any spec that fits the bill at the time.  That just wasn't the way it was.
---
It has a very distinct sound.
---
so, the point of the game is to pose on the if bridge and not doong challenging and rewarding encounters and adventures? man i must have played wrong the last 13 years
---
good looks
---
I disagree... I want vanilla and the whole world that comes with it, not tbc or wrath
---
The riding turtle actually made your movement speed WORSE!
---
My dude, with that you'd be getting ready to kill the lich king.
---
&gt;There is no legitimate reason for respec to cost 50g in vanilla other than for the sole reason to keep it the same as it was.
---
It made your choices matter.  It made you focus on one thing and get good at it.  I mained a disc/holy priest for raids.  In pvp, I eventually learned how to kick everyone's ass as a holy spec.  Only bitches needed to respec everything they wanted to do something different.  L2P.
---
I just watched your link. Tgat was mpt wow related
---
I agree with this. It's not a philosophy many people today will espouse or even understand. Limits on things actually make life more fun and interesting...
---
Just reported you, pitch black is the best mountain dew
---
He replied smugly, as the class that has easiest time farming gold in the game.
---
Again, because it's unpredictable burst damage and there are better talents to choose from. Did you read the comment I linked you? I go through every single talent choice you take over Sword Spec and why.
---
Ok and how does the information of what it use to do when it was very first released have anything at all to do with what I just said?
---
Lowkey I agree with you.
---
Every xpac had it's 'warts' (i.e. shit that was dumb that they would subsequently fix), and this was one if Vanilla's biggest IMO.
---
If I invest the time leveling a class to 60, I shouldn't have to pay out my ass just to be able to play all of it's specializations. Especially since I need to switch to play both aspects of the game (PVE/PVP).
---
I'm super stoked for Classic, and that we have a chance to play it, but this is one of the biggest bummers about it for me.
---
There's no way this isn't bait
---
If this isn't bait OP might genuinely be having a brain aneurysm

It beat Baja Blast, so I am destined to hate it. Counter-reported for griefing. :P

Good - if it’s red it’s dead
---
Thats great, since we have a rather large influx of Retail players here i just wanted to give him a headsup so there won't be a "why is my dps/threat so low?" Thread a couple months down the road :-)
---
Unfortunately I played Undead during Vanilla and can’t be sure of the interaction. For things like this, which I am not 100% certain on, I will be testing at launch and editing the guide as necessary. This guide is far from finished! 👍
---
I can only speak from the experiences I have
---
In his personal stream Mark Kern said that Blizzard had people from Nostralius over and they helped provide those things. There is a clip of it somewhere but I'm on mobile right now and can't look.
---
Yeah that wasn't the experience a lot of people had. Try waiting hours for WSG to pop because no one on the other faction was queueing.  Try waiting days or weeks for an AV to pop.
---
Then you also get to experience the joys of coordinated queue dodging in more balanced servers.  Get on discord withe the opposing faction's PvP group and make sure you don't queue until after theirs pops, and vice versa, ensuring that it's always hardcore premades stomping pugs.
---
LOK'TAR
---
Did you ever raid MC, Ony, ZG? They may not have come to the city, but it was only about one step more difficult than that... but you do you, buddy.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nmmjr/iama_man_who_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_his/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
also he thinks ganking and camping a level 15 char because he's an asshole is alright (his words) but somehow camping him isn't alright because he's a streamer and explicitly says it's not the same. 
---
Dude wants to be an asshole without anyone being able to be an asshole to him.
---
"world first" lol
---
No not annoyed at all, they play how they want, i will do my way when its my turn.
---
also here's the online version blizz uploaded on their classic site:

---
40 man, 15, and 10 man premades will still have rivalries.
---
There was usually A and B team in vanilla for each faction. Do we know how big battlegroups will be? They might be smaller than you think.
---
Having played both I much prefer cross server. "REAL vanilla" had huge amounts of win trading and queue dodging.
---
I said blacklists existed in vanilla, not streamer blacklists, do you read everything with a mind filter on or what ? Are you so set on hating people that are more successful than you ? I don't understand where you're coming from so I sadly can't relate or figure out what you're trying to prove.  
---
Don't be an asshole and nothing happens, it's not that hard.
---
&gt; If your tank and healer are literal kids the game was fucking hard.
---
As will Classic be, when you got a tank, heal and dps who are literal kids, or adults who don't know what they are doing.
---
&gt; Nowdays if you know what you are doing its a cakewalk. 
---
As was back then, when you knew what you were doing.  
---
Not everyone who started WoW was a Newbie. I came from DAoC. Most of my guildmates played Everquest. We were, by and large, experienced MMO players. And most of the people who weren't, were oldschool Gamers, aka. intelligent people, who picked up on the rules of this new game pretty damn quickly.
---
&gt;Stop beeing so negative.
---
Pointing out that what you are saying is wring, is not "negativity". If you want to defend your PoV, do it with arguments. If you try to appeal to my emotions, or conjure up a feeling of guilt, you are in for a disappointment ;-)
---
&gt;I never understood why people hate the pserver community so much
---
Couldve something to do with the fact that their stance changed overnight from:  
---
_"OMG WE LOVE CLASSIC, THANK YOU BLIZZ!"_
---
...into:  
---
_"OMG THIS IS SHIT GAME SO EASY NOOB GAME SHIT EASY CLASSIC RUINED FUKBLIZZ KKTHXBYEWONTPLAY"_
---
I'm sad that I wont get to see your tattoo... I didn't get to see footage of them in RFD but I believe you. I think they would have needed a different team comp too in order to cheese more.
---
Also no way to know that 63+ boss mobs go with 315 defense. Some (in the past) have theorized that they have more than that due to the increased parry rate.
---
315 makes sense for most calculations so people roll with it but it’s far from confirmed.
---
Nah, you needed a certain threshold of honor and other players to get those high ranks, so some unpopulated servers didn't even name a new HWL every week, even after  XRBGs.
---
damn that's wild, surprised that makes decent enough gold to get you close to level 40 mount!
---
The popular private servers in recent years have been quite blizzlike / bug free. Most of the issues I experienced in gameplay were due to lag from overcrowding or being situated on the other side of the world.
---
The best is laughing while casting that last fireball that will end the fight, it makes the animation look cooler too.
---
u act like the quests are the main thing that needs tested which isn’t the case.. most quests were tested as implanted and the employee alpha
---
No it didn't. It moved at normal character running and walking speed on land and had 100% increase to swim speed. It *was* affected by mount speed increases, so technically it could move faster than a player on foot.
---
Red is dead
---
I've been playing BoTW in the meantime, but I can't even enjoy that because all I can ever think is "yeah, this is fun and all, but it ain't Classic."
---
I know I'm playing an alliance warrior, but I can't decide between gnome and human :(. I like the idea of trolling people as a gnome with pink hair and /laugh, but I don't know if/when the trolls will wear off and I'll wish I had made a human. Is escape artist game changing as a warrior? I know humans are much better in pve.
---
Vendor, ah, bank them for when you level engineering
---
Makes sense I suppose.
---
I honestly think there will be plenty of people who don't give 2 shits about stream snipers or streamers and when a stream sniper is being "black listed" they'll happily let them into their guild because not everyone thinks screen sniping is the worst thing in the world. I'd rather player with a troll who spends his days screen sniping and corpse camping than someone ninja looting in groups.
---
Just a heads up, this used to be against the tos, not sure if it still is.
---
This will work again? For sure?
---
&gt; It made talent choice meaningful.
---
I feel like that's every #nochange'rs defense to everything that gets criticized in Vanilla.
---
Like it's okay to admit something from Vanilla was poorly designed. The player experience would almost certainly be better if respec'ing wasn't so cost prohibitive.
---
This is what streamers were put into the beta for.
---
Blizzard invited others into the beta for actual testing.
---
Yep your character should be your character, not oh venruki just took a point from here and put it there, I have to do the same.
---
How is this related to classic wow?
---
This video shows how to get up to the airport without wall walking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvUyDD0rnsE
---
Dunno if it still works in classic.  If there was a shortcut, this would be it.
---
Oh god that's the most overused one lol I think I've seen that on every server and private server I ever played on.
---
You got whooshed son
---
*on beta server ? like cmon you know what i mean
---
I could only see this as a possibility if they keep layering in past the 3rd phase.  Otherwise, you will have servers which are too small to field a 10v10 BG reliably let alone an AV, particularly in unbalanced servers.  There can't be rivalries if there is no BG PvP going on.
---
Is he? That's an awful lot of upvotes for a thread that's straight-up wrong.
---
Was just thinking the paladin might be good for the dungeons, heard they do alright tanking fivemans.
---
Ah okay, I get it now. This isn't a serious thread.
---
Good bye.
---
There’s a reason blizzard invited streamers to the beta, and it’s not because they’re inherently better at testing content. It’s because of the free marketing, and they’re doing a fine good job at that
---
POGGERS IN THE CHATTUH
---
it's only ever worth as conflag spec because on top of shadow mastery, you will generally have more shadow spell damage rather than pure spell damage early vanilla
---
It's less important to discuss what it *should* be when we know exactly what it *will* be. There's zero chance of Classic and Retail having two separate EULAs.
---
&gt; What actually brought us here, is the devolving of the game industry in providing a flood of insta-fix, frontloaded, cheap gratification games, completely forgetting that the only reward required for people to play games, ever since cavemen discovered that it's fun to throw and catch sticks, is to PLAY A GAME.
---
Thanks for buying our game for $60! Now... How would you like to spend an extra $20 in order to *skip* 20% of the game?
---
It’s really crazy. I fucking love summer and I have all of this fun shit planned and here I am looking forward to this more than any of that
---

---
Fortunately in modern vanilla every raid is packed with fury warriors so as long as you dole out some t2 over time you should be ready to go when you get to it.
---
Back in 2006 though... people were not prepared
---
The only person making any sense on this thread.  
---
Soda says he wants people to pretend he's not famous and anyone that doesn't pretend should be punished.  What level of delusion is required to not think that's laughable?
---
the new mac is insanely customisable, what do you mean?
---
I always assumed that they had 315.  It's really easy to test though.
---
Have someone with x weapon skill (say, exactly 305) record their glancing and non-glancing damage rolls against various monsters.  If they are all 315 defense then the percentage loss from glancing blows will be the same.  You obviously need a standard set of buffs and debuffs when you test this.
---
Felt like I listed other things as well but fair enough.
---
Blizzard confirmed miss rate is 8% and also added clarification that the 9% needed was due to how it was coded unless you hit the 305 weapon skill mark. The miss rate isn’t 9% you just need an extra 1% unless you are at 305. 300-304 will only miss 8% according to the blue post. 
---
It’s just coded so unless you are at 305 it negates 1% of hit from gear.
---
Needing 9% hit while under 305 is not the same as a 9% miss rate.
---
We know but xD World First is years ago :P I am more intrested in "Real" First 40 once game is live. Beta server is just limited sadly.
---
Fair point.
---
Yeah its gone. It was pretty fun in PvE setting it to 36 yards as a ranged and knowing that something was in range of your caster if you could see the nameplate lol.
---
Blizzard is the company responsible for World of Warcraft.
---

You maybe more right then you know.
---
Nah. You can't decide what's 'stream sniping' You are exposing your location, making $100k+ a month to play a video game, and you want to whine about when people find and kill you in game for their entertainment? You are here to entertain them when you are on stream. That's what they pay you for buddy. Get used to it.
---
If you think thats crazy Sylvanas is now Arthas 2.0 and Jaina is now as eacist as her father was.

lol who names their child macor

↑ This guy MTs
---
&gt;The issue that I have with your whole premise is that everything you considered "griefing" and everything you considered "non-griefing" can be argued either way
---
I'm not sure if you're not fully understanding or just not reading the rules I laid out.
---
Getting camped is unambiguously 100% in bounds under my rules. There's no exception. You can kill players anywhere, period. Wedding, funeral, dueling tournament(!), anything. Killing is a pillar of the game. If you want to run a dueling tournament, protect it from the people you are at war with. If the GMs teleported away an ally raid who came to kill the duelers, I'd be 100% against that. The issues at hand were, (1) the players had very little recourse. Yes, you can macro target totems, but even with those macros they had an impact on the competitiveness of the duel: Several new keybinds for every relevant totem is cumbersome, eliminating the option of click/attacking totems, visual disruption, not to mention ruining the viewing experience. And (2) there is zero defensible gameplay mechanic at hand here. It was pure destruction of others' experience. Again, if they were alliance killing them it would be completely different.
---
You can disagree with what I'm saying, and I respect the counter position and will respond, but I don't think you're actually reading what I'm saying.
---
Another point, streamers aren’t the only ones playing. There are tons of people not doing that and playing all aspects of the game and submitting bugs.
---
Anyone else get nostalgia goosebumps so strongly you got dizzy?
---
Well, you also promote youtubers on a subreddit that really hates streamers and downvote anything about them, so my guess that you just aren't very perceptive?
---
The people bitching about cartoony... did any of you play WC3??
---
Perfect thank you.
---
I'm pretty tired of this particular circlejerking.
---
sry bro
---
do they think this will stop people from joining their server? Anyone who has a desire to fuck with them, or play with them can just make a char on their server on day 1. The only thing they can't do is save a name for their char. 
---
All this does it make it so that there's a bunch of players who would rather not play on their server wind up on there and then either have to go to a new realm where they didn't save their names, or just deal with the fact their on the streamers server. 
---
I don't see a benefit to this at all for the streamers after they've been able to save their names. It's just delaying the inevitable and screwing over the people who actively want to avoid them.
---
I’ve narrowed my choices to shaman and Druid. My goals for classic are to reach at least R10 and clear AQ40, probably difficult if I only have 15-20 hours a week. That being said I’d like to be somewhat efficient and not have to worry too much for raid spots which is where I find my problem as I’ve seen raids generally want to bring lots of shamans for totem twisting (more gear competition) whereas druids have less competition but limited raid slots. I love support play and the utility of both classes (Druid lack of res doesn’t bother me too much as 2 of my friends will be playing priest) 
---
I’d love to dabble in the dps specs of either if I could as well (PVE)
---
I made a few toons on LH, only got to 20 as not to burn out. Man I cant fucking wait.
---
... no? what do you want them to test? do you have a list of bugs that they should be testing? what do you want them to do: sit there, trying to do quests for hours and getting repeatedly ganked by the opposite faction and not be able to make any progress?
---
the best way for people to test the game is to just play it normally.
---
I still deciding myself.  I mained a priest back then, but alted a warrior and rogue.  I think thinking maybe a shamen this time around, but I am not too impressed with their aesthetics back in vanilla.  So I dunno yet.  Maybe druid then, but not a huge fan of tauren.  
---
Everyone played warrior and rogue and I assume they will flood the servers at the start as they always seem to.
---
Druid was probably the lowest since they were limited to NE and Tauren.  People may have wanted to play druid, but not everyone wanted to be NE or a cow.  The limited racial choices I think made the class less desirable to play for some people.
---
I would say then you don't see a ton of warlocks.  Mages sometimes would be limited as well.
---
this sub seems so strange in what content it wants...
---
Yes, dead wrong, [by Blizzard's own testing and confirmation](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-hit-tables/185675/32) .
---
Dwarf priest, my guild needs one
---
I never said it wouldn't be better. My whole point was that people wanted vanilla. So they got vanila. That includes the bad and the good. 
---
It's funny because Everytime I see anyone argue for something it's to complain about how things are so tough with vanilla and it should be changed for convenient sake or because it's too hard. It would be vanilla then would if we changed things?
---
I much prefer this post to the ‘OMG ppl doing basic stuff on beta’ posts
---
Shadow priests are not squishy in wpvp, you could heal raids and go shadow for pvp. Between inner fire and shadowform, you have more physical damage reduction than anyone except warriors and pallies, PW:S, fear, and blackout keep you safe. If you're planning on wpvping in your raid heal spec, then yeah you're going to get blown up without people protecting you.
---
WoW is an MMORPG, emphasis in this case on the RP.  Your character's role needs to mean something, and in order for it to mean something it needs a degree of permanence.  Attaching a high cost to respec helps to enforce that permanence. 
---
 The gold sink is simply a side effect of its primary purpose.
---
This is choosing one thing over another. You could play WoW, but you chose to work. That's growing up. Choosing work only because you are forced to is not growing up. It's forcing to act like one. &lt;3
---
has the algorithm for the translation system yet to be reverse-engineered?
---
Pointing out the flaw in the rhetoric used in the initial post isn't insulting, unless you feel pointing out errors is insulting.
---
That stand does not cost a $1000. Ofc not, that would be just ridiculous. It is $999
---
Except it is, read over the TOS.
---
How do you know?
---
They did not always have 1 spriest.
---
It was only worth it if you had 4 locks and even then it was just break even.  At 5 locks or more it was definitely worth it but not many raid guilds fielded that many locks.
---
Yes, because there will be a hardcore, superguild on every single server.
---
Except there won't.
---
Duuude the blue was delicious and I’m not even a energy drink person.
---
Hello,
---
im really not sure what to play. I have played warlock since day 1 of vanilla. i always played him 90% of the time. Later in times of cataclysm i also leveled up another 2 warlocks (horde and alliance, with new quests)
---
i also tried other classes, but i didnt really devote much time to them.
---
now im thinking, should i go warlock again? i know i love that class, but also its not going to be anything new to me and also according to polls, warlock seem to be more populated than they used to before.
---
mage seems also to be abundant. i do not to play warrior, rogue or pala. that leaves hunter, druid, shaman, priest, but honestly, i did also leveled shaman to 60 during vanilla and never really played him, so i think he is also out.
---
hunter - i like having pet, i dont mind any micro, feeding, bullets. what im afraid of is fall off after MC (i did do most of aq40, so i know i ll get to that point again) and that you really need them just for tranquilizing. however in pvp they seem to be quite fun to play
---
druid - i know they are not the top hps, and they miss rezz, and you also dont take loads of them for raids, but there is also much less of them compared to hunters. however im afraid of my pvp here. i dont think i ll mind healing, but in world pvp i am not sure if i am cool with the tactic of just outlasting enemy, not really fighting him.
---
priest - i dont have any pro or con here. im in love with anathema benediction, but i already played a clothie.
---
warlock - well its still an option. honestly i think if i play something else, ill level warlock as alt anyway.
---
But but Omar watched the stress test streamers, do you really trust him.  /s
---
I don’t drink soda but I’d buy a one of each to just have, maybe an extra one to drink just to get in the spirit
---
I guess "normally" is a relative term.
---
???
---
I was talking about the OP. If you argue for it, youre an idiot, if youre against it, youre retarded.
---
tfw you realize youve probably spent 1500 bucks on wow subs over the years.
---
Still insanely cheap entertainment, but damn.  It does add up lol
---
not gonna lie, i kinda love your wife.
---
After seeing &lt;Make Azeroth Great Again&gt;, I thought &lt;Democratic Socialists of Azeroth&gt; would be funny, but alas I was rejected.
---
How roasted will I get if I say I am a huge fan of Darnassus? :D
---
i played during real vanilla and cross realm battlegrounds are a good thing. i'm guessing you forgot about the hours upon hours you spent waiting for queues, or the times when you wouldn't get any queues because there was a premade playing on the other side, so, no one wanted to queue.
---
multi rank 14 rather!
---
How many streamers are doing this? And what about the thousands of people not doing this?
---
It had some cool uses for 1 point. You can do weird stuff like put it up, then pull a pack, running away from whoever gets rooted. Even putting it up mid combat to run away and heal.
---
Helped a ton in pvp. Was a way of rooting without casting something (potential for rogue to interrupt). Great against non BM hunters. 
---
Definitely a niche ability. Not everyone did it. I liked the versatility, but I could totally understand passing on it
---
In a lot of raids I've been in you're responsible for tracking times on your own. They weren't very big on having someone do call outs to make sure you knew the mechanics. Even if you have a shot caller, cooldown trackers are useful incase your shotcaller is wrong, misses a shot, or doesn't see it go out because they are not impacted by it.
---
Saw someone in .org doing that the other day
---
Still one of the cheapest hobbies
---
Thank you for such an in depth reply! Really quite eye opening to some of the more intricate parts of the raiding community. However, I was under the impression that progression guilds would often give all the gear to their MT, e.g prioritising your MT for Thunderfury. Is this the case, or are they more likely to evenly distribute the gear between tanks and DPS?
---
i used to do, in general:
---
cheap shot
---
backstab
---
wait-gouge
---
wait-kidney shot
---
maybe-tea-backstab
---
blind
---
restealth
---
cheapshot
---
here it starts to go off the rails due to diminishing returns but you get the idea.
---
Yea cross realm solves population imbalances, premades dodging and win trading, and opens up PvP for people who work odd hours.
---
Plenty of rivals to be made by ganking in BRM, running a premade, or being an active solo / duo Q player.
---
Sadly nothing will be a struggle this time around, everything is known, everyone will have every consumable/buff there is and every raid will have 10 warrior's.
---
most of the outdoor content was more challenging than instances until around RFD. then the dungeons have some pretty tough pulls requiring more coordinated ability rotations, crowd control or counter spells to prevent tank and healer fatal damage.
---
&gt; do they think this will stop people from joining their server?
---
No, that isn't the intention. The intention is to prevent people, especially hardcore players already in a guild and planning to choose a realm on August 12, from purposefully *avoiding* their server. Streamers deserve to have a fair representation of all player types on their chosen realm, not just other streamers and fans.
---
So buy it, then.  Perfectly fair.
---
we might be talking about different things, there are certain thresholds where certain types of swings fall off the table. 
---
but regardless of all of that after 315 is where each point of weapon skill no longer lowers dodge/parry/hit 0.04%
---
 it's known private servers were actually harder than classic wow, this doesn't surprise me.
---

Killing lowbies when you are level 60 (+40 lvls higher than them etc) is griefing. Fuck you if you think it isn't.
---
Yeah, pally blessings are stronk since as a druid you're double-dipping agility and str which translates into an even stronger BoK. Also, less traveltime for farming Gnomeregan which is "nice" if you're trying to push DPS. 
---
Problem is if you're playing Horde you'll have a much harder time arguing for being allowed to Feral DPS in a raid than ally side. You don't get anything from windfury, meanwhile horde melee dps gain massively. Sligthly higher agi base stats but that's kind of nit-picky. 
---
If you're going to play Feral dps you can't be a slacker like the wars/rogues, some muppet in your Guild will hammer you for it. Push that DPS meter hard and the muppets tend to shut up after falling behind to "that feral dps".
---
By all means, make an official server for streamers.
---
"Want to look at celebrities? Come to the Thondroril River server"
---
Honestly WoW is probably one of the cheapest per dollar options out there - a month of play time vs 3 beers vs 1 movie vs half of a cheap ticket to a sports game.
---
Lack of factional rivalries in BGs is one of the biggest cons of the version of vanilla they're rolling out with. My favorite memories of vanilla had almost nothing to do with "content" - they were almost solely in fighting the other faction even though I did raid. Gear was only a means for our side or their side to get a leg up for a time, a side avenue/arms race. The fights in BRM or in WSG were the real meat of the game. Gods, it was glorious. 
---
Once you stopped recognizing the other faction, 1/2 of the feeling of being on a server was gone. At that point, you're only one step away from just abolishing the concept of servers and going full X-realm and sharding anyways. 
---
Big part of the reason I think I rather just wait until BC Classic. If we don't have factional rivalries, I'd rather just wait until the PvP balance is actually in a good place and the raid dungeons in "raid or die" are actually fun. Anonymous vanilla PvP sounds like a sad joke.
---
lmao.. Its why I havent PVPed since rerolling alliance.
---
Torn between warlock and rogue (horde side). My original vanilla toon was a Forsaken rogue, waaay back in the day. Both classes are appealing for different reasons to me; one thing turning me off of rogue is that I like to be the special snowflake, and everyone and their mother plays rogue. I like to be able to stand out from the crowd and prove myself in both raids and pvp.
---
I originally wanted to play feral, but I'm discouraged by their bad dps plus having to fight for a spot. I do like healing, but I don't want to heal all the time.
---
Are locks truly bad in pvp prior to BWL+ gear? I'm not experienced with vanilla locks much but I am an experienced pvper in TBC-cata. I have the wherewithal to juggle fears, micro pets, etc, but doesn't help a ton if I just get killed in the first stun by every rogue.
---
What's endgame farming like for lock? How do you make money?
---
if anything blizzard has themselves to blame for that one lmao
---
Speedlevelers are hitting 20 in ~10/11 hours on beta.
---
-15 hours should be doable to 20, I'd say 15-18 might be a bit more reasonable tho.
---
The only legitimate way would be when you get the corrupted ashbringer from naxx,  you get a long secondary quest thats hard like the ahn quiraj septer that would cleanse the sword into the legendary.
---
Damn that takes me back. I used that all the time in BG’s
---
Here ya go. https://youtu.be/1nlDIXYygio
---
Not asking for a change more of a cool addition, in no way do I expect this to get added for any reason but I was just thinking.
---
Ele is really good but do people want to watch a shaman drinking 80% of the time?
---
Gotta use the MD Ice, rook.
---
Damn, good call

Extra armor isnt a bad thing

&lt;Mediocre&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvE | Casual Raiding Guild
---
Introduction: "Mediocre" is an all inclusive "raiding" guild. We will have the most casual as possible approach to raiding through the various raids in Classic. If it takes us 6 months to kill Rag for the first time so be it. We require nothing more than a general knowledge of your character and a willingness to put in effort to any content we are attempting. By all inclusive we mean that any spec and class is viable so long as its not a total detriment ( Ex. Holy priest dps ) . Want to Ret pally ? Go for it ! Oomkin? go for it. This is a place were we believe being "mediocre" is okay! While this might be a bit of a hindrance bringing even 10 sub optimal classes will not be the difference in a boss kill. Skill and execution will be. There will be no required amount of play time per week all we ask is you put your best foot forward
---
Recruitment: We are recruiting any and all friendly enjoyable people. We don’t discriminate against specs or classes and our philosophy is pretty much our guild name. Want to play an OOMkin .. go ahead as long as its pretty reasonable we have no quarrels with it.
---
Expectations: We are open to any class, and any spec. We believe it is the player that truly matters. Currently, our raiding rosters have room for any dedicated player no matter what class they want to play. We expect main team raiders to put in the required effort during progression that is needed to push forward. We will be using Loot Council when we have a full roster. When not raiding, we expect our members to uphold themselves with manners and respect.
---
Raid Times: Friday and Saturday - 7:00-10:00pm Central / 8:00PM-11:00pm Eastern / 5:00-8:00pm Pacific Please note these times are subject to change based on if the majority desire to raid more or longer.

I’ve done HC raiding in vanilla, tbc, wrath, and cata. TBC was way more demanding than vanilla in terms of time commitment.
---
Yeah of course. I don’t wanna raid with someone that doesn’t install a boss add-on at least on live. The game is balanced around them now and even pre-BC having the timers made you a better raider. 
---
I’m just saying he was ok not doing it because the rest of his raid does. If the rest of his raid had the same reluctance to install a boss add on they would probably be in the dumpster.
---
You aren't understand in my position. Under the current definition of harassment and griefing anything that the tracks from my gameplay experience can be put under harassment or griefing. Therefore corpse camping can be harassment or griefing. I believe that what you have laid out is purely subjective material. which is also why I don't agree with people calling for this person to be banned or suspended because blizzard has laid out purely subjective guidelines.
---
&gt; Do people take them seriously or is the streamer situation really just a non issue of a vocal minority?
---
it's just an issue from the vocal minority being salty that streamers got beta access and they didn't.
---
And the problem with this is?
---
That is not how it was always thought to work.  We might have always been wrong back in the day, but unless you can provide me with a good source show that we were, I am saying that there is no soft cap on weapon skill.  Increasing it beyond 315 still adds all of the 0.04 percents.
---
Yes, in theory you might knock dodge off of the table, but that would take a tremendously high weapon skill that isnt possible by only using things that actually exist in the game.  Even if a particular boss only has 1% base dodge chance, you would need 340 weapon skill to knock dodge off of the table.
---
Was able to fix this issue by deleting my Alliance character and rolling Horde
---
/cries
---
&gt; Guild bank is a prime example of significant bad change as it decreases interactions needed between players.
---
Is a new hairstyle going to scare you away from interacting with someone?
---
&gt;the problem 
---
# WHAT PROBLEM?
---
How does the fact that someone got a title and mount, and you don't, change your personal gaming experience?
---
* Did your character get weaker? NO.
---
* Are your tradeskills worth less? NO.
---
* Did your guilds raid progression change? NO.
---
* Did your friends put you on /ignore? NO.
---
I am not even going on a limb if I say, that you didn't have a shot at Scarab-Lord/Mount in any case. How do I know? Simple statistics, that's how.
---
So what exactly is the problem you are talking about?
---
Here I’ll help you out, just slide me your info and I will level up on the beta for you and let you know which class to play. (:
---
Pretty sure the horde one was re released later as mountain dew code red and it's 🔥
---
correct the benefit is less for a rogue from behind, its more important when parry is still possible.
---
also i think i am talking about something else which is how much weaponskill alters the individual values of hit parry, dodge, miss. When you are under the targets defense rating, each point contributes 0.04% to those values, regardless of if they have fallen off the hit table. Parry will not be off the hit table at 308 or 315 even.
---
However after 315 weapon skill only lowers parry by something like 0.02%
---
it's because you're not supposed to swap specs all the time in classic. It's a RPG, you're supposed to play a role, as in one role. You're supposed to have a spec identity
---
LFR addon will just find people for you to play with.
---
This is the least of the worries about the current LFR system.
---
With the addon you'll still have to play with people from your server (so social reputation still remains), you'll still have to travel to the raid destination, you'll still have to do the pre-reqs/attunements if needed, and the raid difficulty and loot table will be the same as if you were regularly raiding with your guild.
---
I mean, all the LFR will do in classic is to facilitate what you would already be able to do via /2 spam.
---
Hunters probably got the best feel as soon as you tamed your first pet.  Solid casual soloing class as well that was fine solid for both pve and pvp.  So, probably hunter.
---
There is a graphical setting for it. You can set it to look like Vanilla water.
---
Nah cause Mountain Dew is fucking trash and terrible for you.
---
All good, I think it was the divide by 0 error everyone is seeing. I'm working on fixing that atm
---
Gotta go back to my huntard roots (mm)
---
Sorry! My apologies!
---
If you hit 20 and you have run a few dungeons as your main spec role and still like it. It’s probably a good fit.
---
PvP on a PvP server is being a jealous asshole.  I love how disconnected from reality you are.  It's delicious.
---
an exxageration on my part, after doing the math you would reasonably need 3 guilds to do so. 
---
despite that tho, the event would still be severely shortened
---
you won't get blacklisted by anyone, lmao. god, the streamer hate boner on this subreddt and the classic forums is fucking ridiculous. if anything, you'd get props for killing him.
---
Actually they simultaneously announced that indeed, it will cost $200 for a VESA bracket for the stand.. so quite literally $200 for some cheap screws and a metal bracket.
---
Just enter the queue and go take a shower, eat, clean the house etc....
---
We did all that back then and we were fine
---
leveling in private servers was actually easier according to Staysafe who speedrun them, at the very least 1-10 was like a 2 hour difference if not more.
---
I'll be going Alliance and would like to focus on pvp. Played Hunter and Mage in vanilla, for classic I was looking at going a more support route. Whats the best healer for PvP?
---
Yeah...Once TBC was announced my guild quit raiding Naxx
---
Well he hit 40 first on the Beta just like 2min earlier and then straight up bought his mount!
---
Never tried Mountain Dew before, but this would give me a reason to wanna try it.
---
Nah that's just cherry. The game fuel red was citrus cherry, and just got made a permanent flavor!
---
This is the content we all care about... Jesus H Christ, who gives a fuck?
---
I can't decide between Priest and Shaman.
---
I like healing and mainly PvE, but also would like to have at least a bit of PvP potential (mainly with teammates).
---
And would like to reduce respecting costs.
---
So now the question, both are the best you can get on horde side to heal. So which one has more additional potential?
---
Stream sniping Sodapoppin will keep PvP alive just fine.
---
You can raid heal as shadow until C'thun in AQ40 and NAXX.

The *iMac Pro 2019* is not for everyone. They may not have also intended their mount / stand be used with any other devices but you really have to be willing to take a step back and think "Am I willing to spend $1,000 on a monitor stand?". It's a monitor stand, it doesn't matter who it is for or even the fact that it's specifically just for the iMac Pro monitor. It's the fact that Apple decided "eh, these idiots are already going in on an overpriced product, why not just make the stand ridiculously priced as well? They'll definitely still buy it."
---
There was no reason to charge $1,000 for a fucking stand, but they did it *because they knew they could*. They knew there would be people who would get off on the prestige of *who this product is for* as if they're part of some elite club of rich people who are willing to spend a grand on a slab of metal with a bend in it.
---
As other posters said, wait times over two hours were commonplace before cross-server battlegrounds.  I'm sure we'd all love to see nothing but familiar faces in battlegrounds, but I'd rather see some new faces than never get in at all.
---
If you get a good block/reflect set (block %, block value, reflect damage on block/hit), you can literally just do solo Dire Maul East jump runs.
---
I was able to farm the mats for my thunderfury in less than 2 weeks only doing lasher jump runs where you tank down the 5-6 lasher packs for their greys/greens/herbs.  You can also find a book sometimes in at least 2 spots, then reset the instance and do it all over again.  
---
Depending on your drops, you can make a small fortune while idly watching Netflix.
---
No because you are actually losing more time training and crafting than the stat boosts or whatever are giving you.
---
Enjoy! :)
---
/flex
---
I play horde, but I’d have to go with Darnassus.
---
If I go druid, I'll likely do Gnomer when I've already out-leveled it. Still want those trousers and it should be an easy run at a higher level.
---
Yeah, two difficulties doesnt really bug me.  3-4 just doesnt feel right to me, though...its just way too much.
---
what if is was the best person in your guild. But it was a paladin.
---
Both. :D

---
So I ask again. What does this have to do with classic wow?
---
i can say it again i could have added *On Beta Server but i really thought you would all get what i meant...
---
Lmao you guys are delusional.
---
I don't give a damn about it, I never have, it doesn't means tho I'm so damn selfish that I shit on people that could be affected just because it's not me.
---
That's not a nice attitude to have in a community.
---
Same for me, but with crowd pummeler.  Not gonna beat it as a druid leveling weapon for stats for a LONG time.
---
I'll be playing Alliance, and will be focusing on PvP. In vanilla I played a Hunter and a Mage. Was looking to go a more support route for Classic. Whats the best PvP Healer?
---
Except you said an 8% miss rate is wrong and it’s not wrong. The statement that an 8% miss rate is wrong is in fact wrong.
---
Did try a hunter, and even ran a NE to Mulgore to get that pink tallstrider! I did like the immediate bond you feel with the pet. Perhaps I should try this one out more, thanks!
---
WoW has always been and will always be a more casual game. Vanilla WoW was designed as the casual alternative to EQ for example. Trying to gatekeep about raid difficulty is just childish.
---
I can look in to this for a future video!
---
Here is a great forum post going in to some detail.
---
 [https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2489657-Hunter-Tricks-with-Shadowmeld?p=51270297](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2489657-Hunter-Tricks-with-Shadowmeld?p=51270297)
---
Certainly the best alliance city!
---
How many is that then?
---
Back in classic people weren't simply Priests or Mages, they were Shadow Priests or Frost Mages, Prot Warriors, or Resto Druids exactly because respecs were rare. That was their core identity as players. People knew each other as such.            
---
Forgot the gold sink arguments. Respecs should be hard to be meaningful. In fact that is what vanilla is all about, the harder it is the more meaningful it is.    
---
If they got rid of the gold cost, they'd need to replace it with some other limited resources (e.g. respec "credits" you gain over time, and cap e.g. 3x, 1x every 10 days).    
---
But in my opinion gold is already the natural currency in classic and the existing setup is fine (particularly as respecs get cheaper if you do it rarely, down to a minimum of 10g).
---
Streamers talk to each other, agree on server, someone says it
---
&gt;Not asking for a change 
---
&gt;...
---
&gt;addition
---
So if someone grows a tumor in his lung, his health didn't change, because it's just an addition?
---
This but ask for it in a few years. Keep the launch through Naxx as is #NoChanges
---
Yeah, that sounds sensible. I guess by 20 most things are going to be fairly fleshed out. Will try it!
---
They 110% already have this. It’s called a changelog, or just git commit history. It probably isn’t being released because private servers can take advantage of any and all information released that specificity could have. Balance changes are one thing, but when every other commit touches engine code/private APIs, they are probably a bit more hesitant.
---
lol apple
---
Who tf said this game was fair? Life isn’t fair kiddo, grow up
---
He just grinded SM for 20 hours straight so he pretty much tested none of the 30-40 content. Beta test btw.
---
Are there any patch notes or a post I can see the changes?
---
no idea, blizz just said you can create 3 chars on that date
---
HEY! YOU WANNA JOIN MY GUILD??
---
Mark Kern hasn't been working for Blizzard in half a decade, and Nost people were there to discuss the pain points of hosting the vanilla game with modern player's knowledge and ability to exploit things.
---
They were very clear at Blizzcon that they got the data from an old backup of theirs.
---
that's unrelated, the beta had a bug where the pet could be full happiness 1 sec before the bg ends and then be sad instantly after porting out
---
I was playing the stress test (no beta club) and I noticed that pets constantly leashed back to the player during movement. Meaning you have to button mash to get your pet to attack and even then you lost most of your pets dps while kiting. 
---
I have faith they will get it kinked out by release
---
It is is absolutely a retarded price, but many things are rediculous prices when it comes to equipment aimed at professional - why is the 1000 dollar stand any different to 10k dollar office chair?
---
Now?????
---
It was always like this. I mean, people spending tons of dollars just to use facebook and whatsapp.
---
I've never played vanilla lock, just done a lot of googling, so take this with a grain of salt.
---
Warriors in PvP will kill you, it's almost a guarantee (that's true in my experience in retail as well). However, if you can avoid the spotlight or happen to have the right pet out, this can be negated. 
---
In raids warlocks tend to be preferred for bag drops, so they can get soul shards. They are also very welcome, as people like not having to walk.
---
Ah I see. So the actual point is to screw over people who ant to avoid them. Very cool of them. 
---
&gt;Streamers deserve to have a fair representation of all player types on their chosen realm
---
How did they earn this idea or how do they "deserve" it? Does Hugh Jackman deserve to be able to go to a coffee shop without anyone freaking out that he's wolverine? 
---
This is a selfish move by the streamers. Nothing wrong with that, it's their right to do that. But it's screwing over some people for the benefit of purely themselves. Nothing insanely malicious but I for sure judge them more negatively for this move.
---
Most of the target market for this monitor doesn’t need a stand, they have monitor arms or wall mounts they’ll be using instead.
---
The stand is expensive because the neck is mechanically complex to allow silky adjustment and rotation with minimal effort, so it’d be pretty bad if they forced customers to pay for a stand that will ultimately gather dust.
---
I am looking for a breakdown of classes in pvp. Also how does the pvp system work? Do you get more honor as a healer or dps? What's the best pvp healer? What class is fastest to Grand Marshal
---
I just think a lot of people don’t really give a shit about who gets what “first” on a beta server. They’re only competing against people who got beta invites, there’s a lot of people out there that would have reached it before him had they received beta. The pool of competition is a lot less.
---
Hehe, nice try ;) Only like 80 days to go until we'll all be there again for reals!
---
&gt; Do you have a realistic Chance of getting Scarab Lord?
---
How do you know if I personally dont? Without getting to personal i do have a good chance, and if the event is closer to 9 weeks as intended id say a good 9-10 other guildies do. I also plan to personally guard and prevent the horde from banging the gong for as long as i can, to allow more alliance players to have the opportunity. Id also like to make a treaty with the other top guilds if possible

That’s a world first that... matters?  Nothing like grinding for 19 hours for 10 levels on a beta test.

if you have the corrupted ashbringer and go to SM, there's the npc in the hidden area that says something about cleansing the sword. beyodn that, there's nothing you can do. there's going to be a wave of #nochanges people coming in if any quests are added to the game, but I think it would be cool if they allowed it to be cleansed through a very long, very very expensive, and very hard quest chain

---
And anyone who spends day in an out in the sciences knows that while there is no getting around math, there is certainly an overabundance of poor understanding in data interpretation.  You could have chosen many reasons for not liking TBC raiding, but went for the most mundane and inconsequential one, in a pathetic attempt to belittle those who prefer TBC because of gear.  You want to exclaim that raiders loved TBC instead of Vanilla raiding because gear was more plentiful, which mathematically might be true, but such gross incompetence in interpretation for wants and desires says more about yourself than the people who enjoyed TBC.
---
At 300 skill, you will need 9% hit from talents and gear.
---
At 305 skill, you need 6% hit from talents and gear.

The 8% number doesn’t belong anywhere in the conversation.

Appreciate, its very intimidating to narrate like this free form. My editing is poor so I just went for it

Because his comment is an elaborate version of 'this'.
---
But in the datamined files it's actually a downgrade.
---
Great testing by someone nobody gives a hoot about. 
---
Really hope blizzard have some actual testers in.
---
It's not. It's PvP and can only happen in a PvP server
---
Considering it's made to support a screen that is 5999$ on it's own (Yes, that's without the stand), you're probably right :P
---
Constructive.

How do you know he was the first 40?

I get where you’re coming from, and I will 100% give these a watch! Sometimes though people can leave behind some little tid bits that videos don’t in threads like this
---
Generally by your early to mid 20s you will have the majority of a class's main skills so you should have a feel by then if you like the class or not.
---
Oh gotcha, I didn’t catch that!
---
i am sorry but the most extensive testing i have seen only goes up to 305, because on the beta i think only 307 is possible with the right gear and race.
---
My other sources of information are from before the beta and perhaps are swayed towards pserver guess work
---
The highest reasonable weaponskill is swords on human with 318, edgmasters handguards and hungering cold
---
Sorry for what happened to you.
---
Using your account to actively selling gold is the only thing that comes to my mind when thinking about what could warrant a perma-ban.

Herbalism blows just look at what is grinded and made with herbs versus minerals and that is all you need to know.  
---
Herb alchemy was a big mistake for me in vanilla before I knew better.
---
He was not the first 40, snutz was
---
&gt; Which requires the team to communicate his position after using the mind vision, promoting teamwork
---
Classic is not a game for you i'm afraid.
---
newsflash, if people wanted twitch streams then they'd go to fucking twitch
---
stop using this sub as an advertisement platform
---
I mean... you're wrong but ok.
---
And Mark Kern was the one who hand delivered the classic petition to Blizzard and had a meeting with them, so implying that he's not involved is untrue.
---
I wonder of he wants some fries with all that salt.
---
Started playing on release, so.... WRONG
---
It is still bad game design, even if you know it months ahead.
---
Sounds like affliction warlock...
---
&gt;I also plan to personally guard and prevent the horde from banging the gong for as long as i can, to allow more alliance players to have the opportunity.
---
Wow, that is some major hypocrisy right there.
---
So if a hardcore guild does the same to you, it's bad, and warrants a QQ thread on reddit, but if YOU do it, it's allright and great?
---
Congratulations. You just shot down your own thread.
---
I am all for world firsts in Classic but not in a CLOSED beta, sigh....

&gt;It has also been confirmed that Nostalrius mob spawns and timers helped blizzard recreate their own

you gotta a link for that?

Uh, yes. People should treat everyone with the same amount of respect and privacy, regardless of their chosen career.

My goal was to make it is as objective as it possibly can be, but yes, some of it has to be subjective. It's rare for any rules like this to be perfectly clearcut in all scenarios. If you want to enforce anything at all in the realm of griefing you have to be willing to make some judgement calls. 
---
- Is there excessive disruption
---
- Is the disruption caused by mechanisms outside of the intended gameplay
---
- Does the effected party have any reasonable way to avoid it?
---
Words like excessive and reasonable are used in laws all the time. We can't have perfect objective clarity 100% of the time. If you still think this framework is "purely subjective" then I think we'll have to agree to disagree. 
---
But I still welcome any real game examples to test this on.
---
Loved the guild, havent watched it in a while. Back when Wrath was big me and my friends would stay up late playing wow and watching it. Loved Vork's character, so hilarious.
---
This has been around since Vanilla. Nothing new.
---
hmm, I know you couldn't during TBC but vanilla I never actually tried so I could be wrong for that
---
It is break even if you assume all a Shadow Priest brings is Shadow Weaving. VE is free healing and helpful with a lot of splash (or to heal up Life Tap).
---
1st - Mn 2nd - perplexity 3rd - snutz
---
dont u see it? if they fire a frenchie in charge of HoTS league then classic wow is basically cancelleed!!111!
---
Well, considering how well researched some of these videos are, I doub't that.
---
Kargoz and Frostadamus especially put up real quality, and most of all DETAILED stuff.
---
Enjoy :-)
---
Yeah I'm the same tbh. Is that how it works on beta currently then? With agi increasing BASE attack power?
---
Professions alone don't garner much money, but cornering the market on a farmable mat will always been be lucrative.
---
I'm not sure how it'll make them millions for more than at most the first few months. I'm going to stick around for it, but it's not the type of game that appeals to the modern mmo player.
---
literally every streamer is doing this though to level fast
---
 There was no reason to charge $1,000 for a fucking stand, but they did it *because they knew they could*.  
---
Products are priced like this every day, thats how market demand works
---
The % of people who will buy the 6000usd monitor only for the prestige will be insanely small compared to the amount of companies that will but it as a professional tool. You may *think* this product is aimed at rich losers who get off on buying expensive stuff, but it really really isn't, those buyers will be a tiny fraction of the segment that buys this gear and when you're buying a 45,000 dollar PC and screen for your animators you arent gonna quibble about a couple of 1000usd monitor stands.
---
Torn between priest and druid. Normally this would be fine but i really want a night elf druid (i hate the tauren model and cat form) while i also want a troll or undead shadow priest (they get really good priest racial abilities which are good in pvp). 
---
I know i can just make a night elf druid then maybe a human or night elf priest, but knowing im missing out on Devouring Plage/Shadowguard+hex of weakness would feel awful. I dont care much for Desperate prayer/fear ward/elunes grace etc. I know FW is strong but i just dont find the aesthetics/fantasy of a dwarf that appealing.
---
What do i do here? Anyone ever had a similar dilemma?
---
Im personally curious about this since I never played without multiple difficulties. I see the point for sure but from what I saw on the streams, you just need to work your way through them a couple of times and then you are done. I would imagine the lvl 60s take a bit more but I dont see myself coming back to them. Not sure if that is better or not.
---
With what we learned this week about weapon skills, you really want to be Human.
---
That's a much better argument.  
---
Question now is whether it's worth jeopardizing the integrity of the game further for QoL. Thankfully that's on the shoulders of the classic team, and judging from their previous decision in other areas, it can go either way.
---
No doubt. The war effort is the largest event in game so I really don't think many people will want to take away from that experience. I understand the reasoning behind your view, I just believe that the risk of that happening is too minimal for blizzard to make that change.
---
no it did because I ahd one mate, people were moving faster than me if i didn't have my carrot on a stick.
---
I assume that by these guidelines, an infraction needs to meet all of them to be considered punishable?
---
The issue is that the “semi-enthusiast” market that wants expandability and configurability but not workstation-class hardware is tiny at best, and to achieve the prices that this group expects they’re working with near nonexistent margins (other PC vendors in this space are at best making a few cents per unit).
---
Especially given that Apple is the type to engineer a custom elegant case + innards instead of dropping off the shelf components into a cheap box, that market segment just doesn’t suit them well.
---
Yea cause blizzard is notorious for abondoning their games lol
---
Same
---
Nost died for Classic. F
---
I would agree with your recommendation too. Short story back when vanilla launched - my friends were all in the beta, we all had a plan etc classes all picked. Then launch day came Mal'Ganis was way over popped and the pulled it down for a week. We went to a new server but no one stuck to their assigned classes and people were switching constantly and we had stacked too many of one or the other. 
---
In the end if your heart is telling you to go with something go with it. Or every moment you play or every time you see a priest you will get the itch to play one. Unfortunately not every class/spec is serviceable in classic but if you don't enjoy your time what is the point. Play what you want. Priest bro.
---
oh i thought that was added later. know if it has been confirmed working? I figure lot of beta people are eng for pvp purposes so figure someone would have tried it out.
---
Pretty sure that huge classic petition that Mark Kern hand delivered to Blizzard had something to do with it.
---
I wouldn't mind an option to change the difficulty of a raid to heroic/mythic with a title or something cosmetic for completion - no loot changes. If we don't get any new content after the last phase they'll need to do something to keep people around after clearing Naxx.
---
i didnt even play halo, but i sure as fuck drank the shit out of the original game fuel.  Man i loved that stuff.
---
Unfortunately my teeth are still paying the price.
---
Yeah, I'll never spend more than 200 usd in a phone, I only use it to watch youtube, listin to music and messaging.

This post is cancer

So you just doubled down rather than just say, "Oh, my bad." A CM is literally just, as you said, a mouthpiece. A parrot to repeat what they've been told to repeat. There was no need for a parrot to repeat the Token decision because it came straight from an *Executive Producers mouth*. [Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291753/wow-classic-summit-community-information-round-up) has it listed as their summary from the Community meeting they had a while back, with other information you might think doesn't exist as well.

I think it's pretty important to distinguish cult streamers from regular streamers. Most people have a problem with cult streamers, which you can count on one or two hands. The problem is their net viewership dwarfs most others.
---
As someone in the beta, the damage feels different than private servers but it's because every mob has its own (correct) stats, some mobs feel like they hit like wet noodles while others are randomly un facetankable, gotta relearn mob stats
---
Well, if they can get a staff of Jordan from Cath, they will be god tier. Chain lightning is incredible. They also gain access to level 40 mail, from leather working. So, pretty survivable!
---
Blizzard is at rock bottom already. WoW is in the worst state in 15 years. They back burnered everything. OW league failed. HotS failed. SC2 failed. D3 got backburnered years ago. Every IP they have is dogshit right now. They have nothing worth a shit besides WoW Classic and WC3 remastered. Any direction they go can’t be worse than where they’re at right now.
---
They did in wrath, leave classic alone

This is a unique case. They want to bring back to BFA the disappointed players who stopped playing, the way i described.

"here we brought classic, didn't work, join BFA"
---
And after you left the nightmare realm you had to have a tank on the unkillable adds plus you couldn’t look at the boss without taking extreme damage except for burn phases
---
Ah alright, had no idea. thanks.
---
I saw them everywhere all the way till late bc so I don’t know
---
This nails it!
---
My greatest hope to achieve in Classic is to get on a server without any large streamers. 
---
Fuck egomaniac streamers/their fans. Think every game revolves around them. 
---
Yeah, fuck people who dedicate a stupid amount of time to grief them, it's an unfortunate downside to being a large streamer, but the pros still far outweigh the negatives if you're at the top.
---
So cry me a river. Not every game needs to be streamed. That's their problem. Oh, it's their living? Can't miss a game? Welcome to life where not every job is perfect.
---
If your only worry is some tard trying to grief you in a video game, I think you're doing pretty well.
---
Not sure why this is getting downvoted. This sub seems to have a real problem with people who are right and provide actual supporting evidence to their claims.
---
I've never been one to care about gear. As long as I'm getting enough to stay relevant in the raid group I'm golden. What matters to me are the encounters, and TBC was well above Vanilla in that aspect, imo.
---
Let's keep classicwow+ threads on r/classicwowplus  
---
lol xD
---
Oh my god i agree.
---
Remove all streamers from the beta, they are not real Gamer Beta Testers. If I was in the beta I would find like 3,000 bugs and report it all. Give me beta access blizzards!!1 They are unnpreciate of beta!
---
Yes sorry for not noting that
---
Old models look better btw.
---
It’s not like they are talking real world money for anything
---
Damn, I loved the increased range. Everyone spams noggenfoggers for the slowfall in BGs now and keep the shrink effect. Selecting a tiny gnome without plates is damn near impossible.
---
Would love to see them keep the range but disable seeing plates through walls. Or at least keep it at like 30yds.
---
&gt;Alliance says 'ƒ Ä 2 ž ž Ä 3 Ÿ ƒ ƒ', Horde reads 's m e l l m y a s s'.
---
LOL!
---
I remember seeing spam of this in game so much, eventually I think the GM hammer came down and put an end to it.   Think it had to do with a lot of "I rolled triple and he never gave me the winnings" and stuff like that or any report against the player in that sense, but If I remember correctly they lifted the hammer a few years later.
---
So the streamers who betted Gold at the duel tournaments should actually be punished?
---
Could you please eloborate on what you mean please?
---
World first 14 years later.
---
Lol by definition it is avoidable. Play on a pve server.
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
I'm going to take the Wall Street approach to Classic.

Why is that?

Ironforge

---
Fuck that entire dungeon
---
Hi, /u/StriderPharazon
---
Yes, i know. Still, a fast weapon deals more damage with flametongue and a slow weapon does more damage with windfury.
---
Think the other way around, a fast weapon wouldnt deal too much extra damage with windfury.
---
You're right. The position of "Team Lead" usually involves cleaning toilets and organizing file cabinets.
---
I appreciate your insider knowledge of how much each person did while making the game!
---
I'm sorry you don't like the correct answer here. A top geared lvl 40 ele will do as well as any class if piloted by a good player. It will do rather poorly if the player is bad.
---
Play pve server. You know what you’re getting into on a PvP server. Don’t cry when it happens.
---
Man I remember being the manager at a drug store back in classic. After a 12 hour shift I'd come home eat, play for a bit, pass out in my recliner I used as a computer chair and then be woke up at 4-5am to go back to work to open the store.
---
There's no evidence. It's my estimation about this situation. I'm not reporting some secret that I supposedly learned.
---
I'm writing my estimation.
---
Why does streaming a videogame so other can watch gameplay necessarily have mean to have hundreds of people following him around?
---
Doesn't make it right.
---
woops, ill take it down and repost my bad
---
Funny that the streamers could do it on stream at the duel tourney without getting punished then... double moral.
---
I feel the perfect way to lessen powercreep is the first tier of the next expacs raid is what could finally replace ones gear if they literally got BiS during the previous expac. Aside from tweaks, like if TBC adds armor pen and it becomes the best stat for warriors
---
but your average leveling gear from 60-70 should not exceed ilvl 70, where as dungeons would finally get into the 80s, and the raid gear can be 100 (contending with Naxx)
---
aside from that Classic had the best legendary system, that was redone for Shadowmourne, i feel a legendary shouldnt drop but take time and effort of many people to acquire.
---
a super simple way to change tbc slightly is illidian is enslaved, Magtheridon is still lord of outland, with Black temple as his base, in hellfire (as shown in Warcraft 3) after that most dungeons can be physically the same but different
---
Well said mate
---
&gt;but devs still get to decide what is being voted on
---
Here is a crazy idea:
---
How about we leave ALL design decisions to highly trained professionals with decades of experience in the industry, and don't involve the online crowd, most of which have trouble figuring out why their PCs are running so slow while having 170 open facebook tabs in their browsers, at all?
---
Yes, but the translation is not unilateral.

I hope all the people that are crying about streamers end up on fucking abysmal servers with a dead economy and non-existent pve and pvp.
---
play a shaman.  then if you want an alt after you get a couple attunements done, try a priest, druid or mage.  You can always get the alt to like level 15 or 20 and then start playing them to grind out their rested xp.
---
kind of a dead sub no?
---
While i disagree with most of your post, I must point out that a mega server is NOT impossible to maintain or sustain a population and if done correctly will work much better than their old way of doing it.
---
Right because there aren't specific places where celebrities are free from being followed, and celebrities all love to have people constantly follow them around, never in the history of celebrities has anyone disliked that...
---
omg ,I thought of those screws as an exaggerated joke, but it turns out, its true.
---
Absolutely will this time around. But I’m wondering if they saw the account was used for selling gold and I’m saying I was hacked years ago isn’t it easy for them to see all these malicious deeds were done with an IP address from China? Or wherever? Clearly not my IP address?
---
Like some have said, typically it's around mid 20s but I think it  can vary on person (maybe class) because in Vanilla I leveled a mage to 45 before I realized I did not want to play a mage.
---
Im a horde player for lifeee! But I drank the alliance blue... I would love to see thes come back!!
---
Although rogue doesn't have a lot of group utility, don't discount the strength of a rogue's well-timed CC or interrupt in PvE. It's true that sap isn't as easy to use as poly is for mage, but you do have a couple stuns, gouge, and blind in your toolbox to help control pulls. In classic where multi target tanking is much more difficult, this makes a rogue's CC more valuable in smaller group content, where you'd likely be playing with just your friends. I don't worry much about playing an overpopulated class as far as raiding, I see that as more finding the right people and showing up consistently.  
---
Good luck choosing, I'm rolling mage myself after considering every class except paladin!
---
What monitor is that, whats the max resolution, does classic WoW support it?
---
The inventory space is the least of the issues.
---
Would it be nice of them to act that way? Ya.
---
Does he DESERVE it? No. He did nothing to EARN that right. He did the opposite. He made choices he know could lead to this future of him being too famous to go get coffee. He made his choices and he choose to live in a world where someone might freak out about his fame.

Well, thats not exactly money they have to worry about when maintaining the game.  They want to make that money back obviously, but going forward it doesnt really increase.
---
They 'just' have to worry about things like customer service and server maintenance.
---
Amazing content as usual man. Thank you so much
---
Also I didn't think that had PVP ranks in Beta. I know they have PVP but not the titles.
---
Derp
---
Lmao this sub is a salt mine
---
Herbalism is nice because you can just shift-right click and get all the items in one shot. With mining you have to hit the node multiple times to empty it. So speed wise herbalism is faster to gather while leveling.  
---
On the other hand, mining nodes tend to spawn around the outside edges of the map, which makes it a fairly easy route to follow if you're just farming, while herbs tend to spawn all over the place.
---
I guess there's also the fact that the ore from mining is both useful for blacksmithing as well as engineering (esp. on a PvP server), so you'd have a little bigger market for the ores if you're just going to be dumping them on the AH. Herbs though come in handy for later in the game when most guilds are up and raiding and seeking mats for potions/flasks.
---
It's always a tough choice!
---
" If you look at BIS lists, Fury Warriors and Prot Warriors don't share anything in the first 2 phases except an Axe off Onyxia and a Sword off Chromaggus in BWL. In fact, this trend continues through almost all content and if/when your guild gets a Thunderfury, it will stop too. "  
---
You are looking at terrible BiS lists that pretend mitigation is more important than threat. Onslaught Girdle should probably go to a tank first. Band of Accuria definitely tank first. Same with DFT and even chromatic boots possibly. T2.5 gear should go to tank.  Tanks should also get some threat weapon.  
---
Threat issues will be rampant as soon as casters get hit gear. Possibly even in phase 1 if you have good players in prebis. In phase 1, there is so much good DPS gear because of how they are doing itemization that dps are going to be pulling big threat I imagine.
---
It was removed in the most recent build.
---
I mean, isn't that the reason that Classic WoW ended up becoming a thing?
---
It’s pretty much me telling you to invite our friend to the group without having to to target or /invite the person. 
---
Was it in clsssic? No. Is it game breaking? No. Should they remove it? Probably. Will they? Probably not.
---
Except when talking about actual miss rate. Don’t get upset when you say someone was wrong and people point out you’re wrong.
---
They made ICC what it was because only like 1% of players did Sunwell.
---
They wanted players to do the content. That's why they made LFD and later LFR.
---
Getting to 305 weapon skill dramatically reduces the the requirement to get hit capped and reduces the chance for glancing blows.  Realistically, you’ll want at least 308 weapon skill.  Blizzard came out and showed “under the hood”, and those first few weapon skill points are huge.

They won't skip a week or more of streaming under any circumstances at launch.  That first week-to -month is likely to be their most profitable viewership period this year, easily.  None of them care more about the downsides of streaming when compared to losing out on all of that money.
---
Except no one who wants to experience classic is going to do that.  90% of the classic subscribers ever  saw end game content before TBC hit.  They are wanting that now.
---
I found some classes didn't really get into their own until after level 18-20.  Sure some may get it earlier, and some later, but once you hit 20 you should have a feel for the class, have a handful or more greens, and did some talent tree progression.
---
Lol wouldn’t expect any different from APES. Doing the same exact content because they care more about their server status than trying to test out the game.
---
Every weapon is a hunter weapon!
---
They're immune to rules
---
Why do people give a shit about “world firsts” on a beta where everyone’s progress will be erased?
---
In pservers though, it’s not feasible to level by spamming dungeons. I think it’s a combination of classic being easier and dungeon mobs giving more XP
---
Arya will be the new Legolas for Classic lol

I'm planning to roll human rogue, so that's also huge news for me in that case. Thanks for the clarification!

Disliking something doesn't mean you deserve to avoid it. I dislike that I have to go to my job. That doesn't mean I deserve to not go to my job. 
---
&gt;Right because there aren't specific places where celebrities are free from being followed
---
Just like there are places streamers are free from being followed. But a public MMO isn't one of those places.
---
Yes. I usually make macros to /yell Y O U L O S E and spam it when I crap on a horde in pvp.
---
If you’re stuck, ask general chat before googling the solution
---
I am not sure if I agree with the second guideline in terms of what was happening and "intended gameplay" but I'll concede it. My question is this, do you not think that what I laid out in previous posts were "reasonable" way to avoid this?
---
\&gt; Players like Soda displayed their screens after they arrived to new locations, giving this player time to also travel there. They could have gone to any number of places with higher level mobs that weren't neutral areas which would have prevented a level 1 character from accessing those areas. As I mentioned before, knowing who you were dueling next gave you opportunities to create macros specifically for that player, thereby ignoring the fact that any other player was in the area.
---
You're correct, the early zones are not contested. In fact, you can get to around level 22-24 before even entering a contested zone.
---
That's how I leveled my alts in Vanilla.  
---
But
---
Let's be very clear.  Beta is for small bugs and free promotion from streamers, not for people who care about Classic.
---
WORLD FIRST
---
its not minimal, pservers that dont adjust the reagents have around a 2 week warfront time period, which is very short
---
20 is my number if by 20 your still happy with the class you’ll probably enjoy it to 60
---
I remember spamming sm Gy to level during vanilla, when they used to launch new servers during that time, I rerolled on one about 2/3 of the way through vanilla's content and people were definitely spamming Gy for levels in the early 30s, not to mention lots of warriors and shamans spammed armory and Cath as much as they could.from 35-40
---
I thought it was because current WoW doesn't appeal to nearly the amount of people that vanilla/BTC/WotLK did, and when they saw their subcounts constantly dipping per expansion realized that they get a free redo by just releasing vanilla WoW.

I'm guessing that the WoW Night's Watch was inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire books.
---
I WAS HERE
---
It's not necessarily different, I'd say both are pretty dumb prices for those products.

Snutz wasn’t first. People were posting in snutz chat when Mn hit 40. It was a good 30 minutes to an hour before snutz.
---
All he did was make a formal declaration of war.  Added a lot of fuel to the fire.  People love those "challenge accepted" moments.
---
i think its second,Monkleynews got 40 about 30-50 mins ago
---
Can't test level 40 shit at level 30. Gotta get there first.
---
seeing as how you need 2 pieces of it, most of the guild would probably quit if they saw a hunter take the piece just because they are the GM and would make it nearly impossible for you to get the 2nd, and now youll be hated
---
It was definitely BC. I remember these coming out when I was first playing.
---
idk i like to think that this whole movement is bigger than a singular game, its about the prolonged success of an mmo we all love, it needs to be able to thrive in 4 years as well. I think the future can be discussed here.
---
I am just responding for the sake of shutting down your "argument". Based on your insults, I am not obliged to take you serious as a conversational partner.
---
Yes, I did in fact cruise through the dungeons a month after release. Sorry you couldn't do that, I guess not everyone was as experienced as me and my buddies back then. Must have been hard on you :D
---
We got our mage writer set up today!

---
Makes. A lot of sense. Thanks for clarifying!
---
The funny thing is, as an EQ player from 1999-2001, Vanilla WoW *is* my example of an insta-fix, frontloaded, cheap gratification MMO with shiny-blinky shit popping up every few minutes.  The illusion of progress as numbers just keep getting bigger and bigger was clear from the get go.
---
I’ll be leveling with some friends and we may dungeon and even raid together. So far they’re playing Paladin and Druid. What class would you recommend to go alone with that? I’m thinking it’s between mage or rogue but I can’t decide between the two. Human Rogue (for sword specialization) or Mage gnome(int) or human(looks). Appreciate the help!
---
So let’s care about something stupid? That’s terrible logic
---
It wouldn't be that easy if they used a VPN service or other hacks to hide their real source, people usually do that when doing illegal stuff.
---
There may also be internal policies we don't know about, maybe when an account is caught selling gold it must be banned, period, no reversal allowed.
---
If they didn't do that IMO it could be easier for all those blatantly lying about it, it's ofc unfair to the honest ones and very sad, but unfortunately for all of us, honest ones are a minority.
---
Alright, it's a good monitor for its category. Great.
---
Why does its STAND cost a THOUSAND dollars?
---
Not being feared means you get higher uptime on boss = more dps
---
just buy code red if you are horde
---
I was just going to suggest keeping an eye on Milksteak, but I see that you already are. I think that an ele shaman could do good at this level cap, ele mastery + chain lightning was always a game changer. Getting the spellpower gear will the hard part.
---
I remember playing my ele Troll shaman back on Lightning's Blade, great times. Was pretty stoked to get my full T.5 dungeon set.
---
they could also upscale all textures with an AI, with that it wouldn't even be work for them
---
Good for him. 
---
If I had an army of spergs to help me no life SM over and over again and didn’t have my job I’d be in the same place. 
---
I’m going to do a mix of questing and Dungeons on my warrior. I got to 31 last night before bed. Looking forward to 40. Hope I have the gold for my mount by then. 
---
When servers go live I am taking off for 7 days. I hope to attempt a server first warrior to 60. Going to live on heat and eat food, delivery and 18+ hour days.
---
I dont think integrity is violated because we already have 1.12 AV, both of which were in vanilla. I think server imbalance will be far worse than in 2004 leading to pvp grinding to a halt. Certain servers would basically be excluded without crossrealm
---
Get defensive but everything I said stands. Ride that dick.
---
The great thing about a sub is you can stay subbed for as long as you think the content is worth it. If it really turns out to be like you say then who the fuck cares, it's not like blizz is forcing you to play classic or BFA. People will just stop playing by the millions like they have over the past decade.   
---
I can't be the only one here who has caught on to Blizzards tactics. If they want to try to bait and switch the classic experience with something that fundamentally makes it not the classic experience. People will leave just as quickly as they came. I have a feeling that Blizz know they've lost the benefit of the doubt with their classic audience. Every move and every change they make is under a microscope at all times.  
---
I agree with a couple of your points, but each can be rebutted pretty easily. You just seem to have an overly pessimistic take, which I can't blame you for. But there's more to it than just "Blizz is gonna bend over for streamers"
---
I got a 2 month ban.  Even after the GM told me to stop.  I couldn't the gold was so good.
---
People aren't making fun of the monitor, they're making fun of the stand
---
Does it matter if its Human or Dwarf? Tempted to go Human for the rep bonus, just to make life a little easier in game.
---
I did the shoot run kiting but once you leave level 5 area mobs ran much faster. I had issues with poachers in mulgor. They would cast insta rejuv and had no mana. It was actually impossible.
---
True, in my head I was thinking a million players... Skipped an order of magnitude there.
---
No it wasnt.
---
How does that change the hypocrisy in any way?
---
You complain about guilds preventing access to the SL Title/Mount.
---
And you plan on doing the exact same thing. The fact that you don't have the dedication and resources to be effective at it, doesn't change anything.
---
What's stupid about leveling fast? Yes it all will be erased, everything will be erased, it's about the journey, about the gameplay.
---
Does anyone else remember the Flightpath from West Fall/Goldshire/SW to Booty Bay traveling over the arena, and not around it? I don't know what the FP currently does on retail, but i have a very vivid memory of the flight path going on Gurubashi Arena.
---
I agree other than the expensive part. I love long and difficult quest chains but I hate when I have to put my gold toward getting gear like that. I don’t pay gold to run aq or naxx, why pay gold for cleansing a sword? Just my opinion though.
---
just be glad it doesn't sound Gengar!
---
Ain’t getting defensive, got no reason to defend. Thought I’d take my time out to educate a stupid comment :)
---
Omen threat meter
---
Those genius bastards! Give the community a game they want just to turn it in to shit but somehow keep the playerbase and keep them from falling back on pservers.
---
We are all noobs on this glorious day
---
My bad I think it's armory. I'm lvl 36, not possible to know the tank lvl.
---

Roughly translated dialog :
---
Me : Tank put a shield on, you're taking too much damage
---
Tank : no, I don't like shields
---
Me : yeah but that's what you got to do
---
Tank : just heal the right way and it will be good
---
Shaman : I can heal if you want
---
Hunter : I pull ?
---
Me : no just tank the right way
---
Shaman : Tank don't talk to hum like that :s\^\^
---
Me : I don't have endless mana
---
Tank : just kick me if you want then, I won't put a shield, I'm my own master
---
Shaman : we'll stop when you want
---
Shaman : ok ok take it easy
---
Me : change class then 
---
Shaman : I'll help if you don't have mana, tell me
---
Hunter : no let's not argue about that
---
Shaman : stop !
---
Me : OK go
---
Shaman : priest if you don't have mana say OOM, and I will replace you
---
Hunter : the drood and the warrior tank, shaman and priest heal and I just look \^\^
---
I am the same.  I am glad I have 3 months to figure it out but will have to choose at some point :\
---
This is the dumbest theory I’ve ever seen. You are paying $15 dollars for classic, or retail 
---
They couldn’t care less which game you are playing. As long as your playing

Only private server neets like yourself feel that way.

It could have honestly been someone with an enchant or item that increased run speed. I just significantly remember being outrun by people that weren't rogues.

Thunder Bluff is actually really special to me too. Mulgore is so tranquil!

Yep!
---
  Jk just thought your post was a funny way of explaining it haha
---
you seem like such a cool guy. not caring about anything, please teach us all how to be as cool as you :)
---
Wait, I though clickers were the noobs. Why are the button mashers the noobs now?
---
RP yeah, but I also think I'll have the most fun with those abilities, and don't really care as much for the flavor of the others.
---
MMOs don't really need to be 14 million subscriber giants to be successful. FFXIV is arguably one of the best MMOs out there atm with regular content and a healthy playerbase, and its subscribers are sub-1 million per player estimates. I'm not even going to estimate what Classic will be at (could be 100k, could be 1m...), but it would take an act of god for it to not be profitable.
---
I was playing in closed beta, got every server first on Laughing Skull and World First in Naxx. I feel like you’re an idiot and I played a lot more than you, if you played at all.
---
I appreciate these kind of stories.
---
0/30/21 was a level 60 hybrid spec that allowed you to tank and DPS in 5 mans while healing in raids and 5 mans.
---
For leveling you go all cat talents till 31 points. Then you take 11 in balance for omen. The rest into furor in Reston.
---
I couldn't even guess. Most seem to play with each other so 5 for every group, right? In some cases some weren't streaming but in groups with others who were so whatever you take from that go right ahead.

---
They're hoping people like me, who returned and re-subbed just by the news that Classic is ABOUT to be released, to get hooked back, and stay.
---
Thats how it is. Ask blizzard
---
The Ashbringer is in classic.  and im not talking about the corrupted Assbinger.  Once the game comes out you have to look hard or else you won't find it.
---
https://youtu.be/u_azvBdVgz0
---
This might interest you, it's based on pserver meta where TPS is required to be much higher. The whole channel is quite interesting though because it shows how things have changed due to people 'solving' the meta at 60 and the changing requirements of needing less survivability and much more threat from your tanks. 
---
I would imagine some form of fury/prot hybrid build would work out pretty decently for allowing for tanking 5 man's and still able to farm effectively. It would still be pretty gear dependant though. 
---
It will be interesting to see how things will differ compared to vanilla with the early 60 meta, since dps will most likely be much more effective now. I'd imagine we will see a lot more of a shift towards things like dual wield tanks or druid tanks in higher tier raids.
---
No way would I trust that. What stops them from running off with the money?
---
Yea I definitely think there's a connection, sworn to fighting undead and forgotten by their respective king according to wowpedia
---
Streamer issue aside, how do we know that there are "plenty of realms to choose from?".  Has Blizz actually released any actual information on this or is it just a classic Warcraft circle jerk assumption?
---
I think they may have had layoffs in the past due to strategic shifts, but generally laying off staff in order to outsource is used as a cost-cutting measure and typically would result in a lower value product. The reason that companies don't wholesale outsource 100% of their development to India is because it would seriously hurt the products that they produce and the interactions with their customers. I'm not sure exactly if they are switching to outsourcing or simply downsizing that division, but either way both are potential signs of a failing business. 
---
While the eSports division doesn't exactly concern me, the fact that the upper management is out of touch with what gamers want, tied with the company struggling as a whole, could be a problem. Believe me, I want the company to do great, because I want great games and a WoW Classic that survives for years!
---
I kinda feel you, as I was coming from DAoC, and yes, WoW was an extremely relaxed and casual game in comparison to every MMO that came before it.
---
But instant fix gratifiction? No. I have to disagree here. It was a beautifully crafted game world, that I could completely lose myself in, without chasing immediate rewards. Yes, you got your first few levels post-haste, quets givers were easily identifieable and there were other comforts, but that doesn't make it instafix :D
---
I can hear the salt pouring out of your pant legs as you walk. Daaaamn man
---
I'm actually amazed that he was serious and I partially refuse to believe it. As for the rest of your response. Cry?
---
be careful, you dont want your tinfoil hat to blow off your head and have blizzard read your mind
---
The weapon is in the game files yes, but in classic as a player item? No.
---
Cause the minority has the largest voice, right?
---
Considering many of the popular streamers are for no changes, i do believe blizzard is likely to listen to them... by doing no changes.
---
Yeah, like I said I skipped an order of magnitude. Though there is the question of how many NEW players it'll bring in, or mostly people who are already subbed.
---
Was it all sm grinding?
---
Except thats Uthers god damned job. There was no "chance" of people turning it was a literal fact. He was told of the gain that turned people into undead and saw the aftermatch of Arthas' stand in Hearthglen. How the surrounding villages all turned into an undead horde after consuming the grain and fell against Arthas' forces like a fucking tsunami.
---
Uther should have tightened his pretty little chainmail skirt, bent knee to Arthas and followed his future King instead in saving what could be saved. Instead he decided to turn a blind eye while the enemy gains an entire towns worth of soldiers in the form of an undead army.
---
That's exactly what I wrote with different words.
---
Lmfao what an overreaction
---
2-3 hours a day means it’s going to take you like a month to even hit max level. The world record for 1-60 was just under 5 days /played.  So I would expect to be behind everyone who plays all day for a long time. It’s possible to get up to that point but it will take a while.
---
Totally agree!
---
Regarding Classic compatibility, have you checked the following resource?
---
[https://github.com/Ketho/BlizzardInterfaceResources](https://github.com/Ketho/BlizzardInterfaceResources)
---
You can check out the  classic branch and take a look at **Events.lua** and GlobalAPI.lua in order to figure out if you are using something that was removed in the classic API.
---
(Sorry for the double post)
---
If anything wow classic is the safest project, it has senior leads that have always been there and an engineer from back in vanilla.
---
Yeah, just feels real bad knowing I can't have both a night elf Druid and a troll priest, the two race/class combos I like the best by far. Guess the choice ultimately boils down to Alliance vs Horde.
---
I don't know much
---
but I know you're wrong
---
Played a lock to r11 in vanilla:
---
Warriors are a guaranteed kill with sucu in destro spec. Really, they are by far the easiest to kill. Then mages iirc. Rogues will kill you though 90% of the time, no chance.
---
Truthfully I think it'll bring in almost no new players. I don't think that's a bad thing, though. WoW's model since Cataclysm/MoP has been to appeal to a wider audience since during WotLK it started to see lower new player retention.
---
Problem with this model is that WoW still has shitty new player retention, and now it doesn't appeal to the actual demographic that plays WoW. Which is fucking enormous by the way. So if Blizzard literally only appeal to the WoW player with Classic WoW, that's still going to be a demographic of 10-20 million players, many of which are still actively gaming.
---
Well that's a bummer, I've always been resto (aside from a bit of enhance during ToC and ICC). I always just assumed it meant the same overall dps.
---
Im horde but the blue one was THE best.
---
Some people come up with the most stupid shit
---
Yogg was just not asking any of the watchers to help you. Had 5 degrees of difficulty (4 lights to 0 lights). Alone in the Darkness Yogg is, to this day, the hardest (but still completable) boss, in terms of clear rate; having been beaten by exactly one guild before the next patch.
---
Well if I would be spamming lightning bolt and CL well sure it's a real mana hog. 
---
But a more sustainable way to lvl is to drop lightning bolt then searing totem, and just fish for clearcasting procs and shock for no mana. If the private server im playing on has it right, my flametongue melee swings and searing totem firebolts can proc clearcasting, and I plan on using daggers since the fast melee swing will give me more chances to get a clearcast proc.
---
If im right then i think ele shaman will be better for the playstyle my brother and I are going for.

---
The problem was is that you're believing that blizzard wont just do the exact same progression if it ignores its community just like WoW currently ignores its active player base and implements systems and content this is unfinished or barely tested. We all know why Classic exists, voting for content is just an easy way for checks and balances to exist. The people that don't realize they have 270 tabs open won't know where to vote anyways.
---
Sure, but you can go from 325 to 360+ in a day from world quests.  Chain queuing Heroics is actually slower gearing than just doing the world quests.
---
Wife her again.
---
So true.
---
Bank toons are great!
---
this joke will haunt me.
---
Ditto
---
&gt; Idk why you are against good old fashion world pvp from taking place
---
I am not, and I would do the same.
---
But I wouldn't be a hypocrite complaining about some guild trying to prevent access to SL, when I was gonna do the same thing.
---
We will never be slaves!
---
I believe blizzard see's it as a minimal risk due to the fact that it's a small threat across the servers as a whole. I can't say it will happen, and I can't say it won't. I just don't see blizzard changing it.
---
I don’t drink soda either but I’d 100% buy one of each, drink them and be satisfied for the rest of my life. Or if they made a vanilla flavor for “vanilla wow”, that would be bomb asf.
---
Mining skinning could be doable since ill have transparent doggo form to roam around fast... thanks for this comment or else I wouldnt have realized hahaja
---
I can’t wait to be WOLRD FIRST level 2 then brag about it all over reddit when classic drops. That will be sooooo badass. I wonder who the world first level 15 will be??! Can you imagine a world first level 19?? OMG a world first level 21 will be so fucking crazy!! I’m gonna lose my fucking mind if someone gets world first 32!!!!
---
Is a very crappy Pokemon
---
Lmao.  
---
OP: "Bet you haven't heard of this before"  
---
Possibly every vanilla player alive today: Uhhhhhh...
---
Isn't the quest ring from that thing quite good too?
---
Couple of questions - Why not these talents: 
---
Improved Taunt? - 2 sec CD reduction?
---
Improved Shield Wall - 5 sec extra duration?
---
so would you be willing to repost this with a more appropriate title?
---
:)
---
It won't work in vanilla though?
---
When you're coming from a game that took close to a year to obtain end game, being able to get there in 2-3 months is definitely insta-gratification.
---
Is not a change the Ashbringer IS in classic and was removed with Naxx moving to Northrend.  And I'm not talking about the Corrupted Assbinger.  And yes it is true there is a tumor in your lung. And I'm not talking about your corrupted lung bringer.
---
As someone who plays 2-3 hours as well, good???? WoW is an RPG. This equality shit is honestly stupid. Leave any type of scaling to rated BGs and arenas, which isn't classic anyways. Of course you should get destroyed by someone whos life is WoW. Why would it be fair if you didn't?
---
 They are spending a huge portion of their day to better themselves in-game, while you are probably bettering your IRL job/financial status. More work should always produce more results. It'd be stupid if that wasn't the case.
---
Exactly.  I'm not going to intentionally putz around like the noob I was 15 years ago, but I don't need to min/max the leveling experience.  Half of why we (or at least many of us) wanted Classic is that the leveling experience isn't a complete joke of a blitz to max level like retail has been for several expansions.  Stop and smell the roses, and enjoy the journey!
---
you seem a bit detached
---
Paladin by a mile
---
lolsad
---
You are completely wrong unfortunately.  The sword existed in classic you just haven't looked hard enough.  Non deserving.
---
Not sure if that will work on Classic or not but mouseover macros are your friend.  I use nothing but mouseover macros for my healing spells and other types of spells.  Works great, for me at least.
---
Either way, good luck and have fun when Classic finally hits.
---
they're also testing that stuff along the way, SM is getting **thoroughly** tested right now. Is that a bad thing?
---
&gt;checks and balances
---
Those are a cool idea in politics, and a TERRIBLE idea in technology and design.
---
Fact is, most people are not qualified to take ANY part in the design process. Would you wanna sit in a plane that was designed by a random crowd on people voting on which parts to use, and how to put them together? I wouldn't even go anywhere near it :D
---
&gt;that you're believing that blizzard wont just do the exact same progression
---
No, they won't, because now they know how it ended. And you can bet your hindquarters that they will draw their conclusions if classic is a success.
---
both are good options
---
with a pally and a druid at your side you can go anything
---
Can I have whatever you're smoking? It seems fucking awesome!
---
This isn't a hard choice at all.
---
Oh people are making fun of the monitor too
---
Smooth as glass so far. I have a warrior at 31 and a priest at 18ish. Few others around 10. Been testing as much as I can. I had a pretty nice rig back in the day. My current pc while not a shit box is nothing to brag about and I am running it on ultra with no issues.
---
human is a fine pally choice
---
No, I don't drink that shit or soda at all for that matter.
---
JEBAITED
---
You cant add it in Vanilla, but you could add it in a TBC expansion.
---
During the SM Cath event Fairbanks says this 
---
&gt;But his son is dead.
---
&lt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks shakes his head.&gt;
---
No, &lt;race&gt;; only one of his sons is dead. The other lives...
---
&lt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks points to the sky.&gt;
---
The Outland... Find him there...
---
Not preventing anyone from getting scarab lord. I am extending it 1 hour if i can at the most. I doubt id be able to continually fight for over an hour
---
lolparanoia
---
You speak with sound logic. But so far I’m at 4 years of no soda at all, not even a root beer float, and I’m not sure I want to break that streak. Although I have had some brandy old fashioneds (contains white soda). Hard to be from Wisconsin and NOT drink those at least a couple times a year. Hmm.
---
The problem with just going through the expansion motions, is that while it was popular, WotLK begun introducing a lot of the problems that got more and more expanded upon the game the exists currently. The dilapidation of WoW was a snowball, as time went on the problems began to get bigger and bigger, but the power creep issue didn't begin outside of the beloved core game. The content became more streamlined and simpler during WotLK, the social aspects began dying in Cata, and after MoP, the community aspect of WoW has mostly died. Nostalgia for something doesn't mean that their isn't a better alternative. I just wan't to avoid the problems of the last 15 years happening again to a game I have a lot of respect for.
---
I want the gameplay and the feel of classic.
---
I wouldn't mind the game looking good at the same time.
---
This made me laugh so good!
---
Awesome, thanks for the advice. All the feedback has me leaning more torwards priest! :)
---
PvP gear in classic was crap anyway. You're going to get one shotted by button mashing noobs with or without it on occasion. With the best PvP gear in the game I had like 1K more HP, no significant damage reduction improvement, and similar damage (slightly lower in some cases).    
---
People forget PvP damage reduction wasn't added until later expacs.
---
After you read how he treats Tirion you will understand. Uther is a bigot.
---
With this type of attitude you'll never get the legendary Ashbringer.  Have you checked off the coast of Eastern Plaguelands yet ;)
---
I never leveled any tauren past 20 and yet I remember how nice was to quest in Mulgore 14 years ago. Lovely place, and the city is beautiful.
---
The journey was SM spam runs....wtf r u on?
---
Enchanting, Mining, Herb, Skinning, and a paladin can get whatever he wants. You can gather and sell stuff, so long as you just loot everything and vendor the junk you should be about the same if you're pulling 4x as many mobs
---
Yeah I agree with you. I think a lot of these streamers elevate themselves far to high. Sure, guys like this wont have a load of followers or w/e but at the end of the day most people aren't going to really give a shit about who you are ganking, just show up to raid on time with consumables. 
---
There will be a lot of guilds. A guy going around blacklisting people for ganking him, is going to end up just getting laughed at, and making himself look bad to be honest.
---
What? Of course they’re right. It’s been completely standard in the industry for 3-4 years now to involve content creators in the prerelease and launch of a game.
---
Of course!
---
Happiness cannot be found. It must be taken from another.
---
Why by a mile? Priest looks interesting. Is Paladin that much better?
---
I was wondering the same thing. It's really confusing isn't it?
---
I can tell you that the answer would have to be a no because I played a Warrior and later a Warlock, and I believe I did the quest on both characters.
---
Does mage trinket clear stun? And with no red pet a mage can easily zone a hunter and freeze the pet leaving it unable to get stun off anyway
---
I didn't realize aesthetic character model ruined the game, add that to the list of extreme exaggeration and nitpicking about why Retail sucks.
---
Oh I can’t wait for South Park’s new WoW rendition! Streamers abusing there influence like politicians, god bless America. Game on!!
---
Ya but vanilla isn't necessarily a race to 60 for everyone.
---
Unlike retail vanilla is more than max level content, the leveling process is half the fun
---
This isn’t even a joke. I remember in WoD (the last expansion I played to cap), where I’d log into my follower missions or whatever they were called, and they would have actual gear upgrades for me. I was raiding heroic content weekly. And I was getting upgrades from follower quests that took me 2 seconds to send off with an add on.
---
What a complete travesty of a game.
---
Name one person who was blacklisted from an entire faction for killing a streamer and I mean that being the reason, not being a total dick to everyone else.
---
I don't get that meme. I know they release only overpriced garbage for retarded fanboys, but that can't be real.
---
&gt;Is not a change the Ashbringer IS in classic
---
### WRONG
---
[The Ashbringer](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=13262) was never an obtainable item at any stage in Vanilla. It was in the files as a leftover from an earlier design phase.
---
What you are talking about is the [Corrupted Ashbringer](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=22691). Which will be in the game same as before.
---
&gt;And yes it is true there is a tumor in your lung. And I'm not talking about your corrupted lung bringer.
---
Well, I guess we won't be hearing from you again. Good bye.
---
I think that with all of those measures you'll be pretty close. Skipping spells and having a paladin split some gold with all of you should help a lot.
---
You can get great upgrades throughout your experience in Azeroth being able to produce your own gear.  It also helps with the ability to save gold while pursuing your mount.  
---
It’s all a matter of a persons perspective.  Whatever you do, have fun with it!
---
I think the one simple constant is that you cannot grief your own faction. It goes entirely against the spirit of the game and I think doing so absolutely warrants punishment.
---
&gt; I always assumed just some gold farmers stole my account and had there way with it.
---
Pretty much. An inactive account is very desirable for gold selling services because that reduces the chance that the actual owner will notice and do something about it. Like steal their gold.
---
Is WoWhead still full of spyware/addware/viruses/malware and the owner tells people "suck it up and pay for premium to avoid it"?
---
If so, hard pass.
---
What about from an input perspective? Do you feel like there is a weird latency when you swap stances?
---
Do you see other players movement glitch out often, or are they mostly smooth?
---
Well one other thing. Im sure the reagent required amounts were considered based on average realm size.
---
I think itll be triple or atleast more than it was 
---
So is it a change if blizzard calculated certaint things based on realm size at the time?
---
But that accomplishment is artificial if it’s simply a list they had a whole year to check things off of, right?
---
&gt;Phase two will be to use the opinions of the streamers to change Classic
---
Lol no. Blizzard's "secret plan to destroy Classic" is to deliver Classic with almost all of its warts. Let people experience Classic for themselves. The honeymoon phase will last long enough for development of their newest expansion to progress, and just as people begin to resent Classic, Blizzard will be queued up to reveal their next expansion and reveal "Pristine" servers for the new expansion with no LFR/LFD, no cross-realm, none of it. 
---
A large chunk of people just want to return to a community-driven WoW. They don't actually want specifically Classic. Drain their will to play Classic by giving them Classic, and then offer them something better.
---
It's just the backend. We still play on separate servers like the old days.
---
I could never get this point. This is a game, not a chore.  If the game is well-designed the time you invest should be reflected in superior **skill ,** not arbitrary points to allow for an abstract advantage as a way to "reward" your lack of real life obligations.
---
Looool
---

---
I played a bit on Retro testing some things out and I could tell a difference. Its just not quite as responsive. I don't remember what my ping was to retro, but it wasn't as smooth as the beta server which I sit at around 40ms.
---
Missing out on instant corruption is going to cripple you
---
Right which would feel off putting
---
My favorite part was, revamp old areas to allow viability. Content was meant to be out leveled. I mean, I guess if you want, blizzard could try to do something different then the formula he stuck to for 15 years. But judging purely by history, it works. Look at how many more people played Burning Crusade and then classic, and then look at how many more people played wrath than burning Crusade.
---
cringe. no ones feeling are hurt. 
---
"I never asserted that you were intentionally trying to deceive"
---
why would you even bother saying that? are you a jelly spine? dont try and wriggle out of it haha, thats embarassing =) and it doesnt even matter
---
"**Stop trying to confuse people....**"
---
haha youre a cornball
---
You can probably get rank 10.
---
Some good pvp gear comes from raiding BWL too. 
---
Either way you will be behind those who devote more time
---
Ironically thats the word I was originally looking for and I forgot but you're comment was right.
---
how'd he get up there
---
How it ended? They're still making the same content now that people are complaining about regularly, if they've learned how it ended, they wouldn't of continued to drag the dead horse by its reigns. Current WoW exists to spike the dopamine of a person as often as possible and to sell store mounts by making content that is "optional and cosmetic" look nicer than anything you get for actually playing.  
---
Also the process of voting to implement change isn't like building a plane, more like deciding if there's cupholders by each seat, the color of the plane, how far the seats can recline, what in flight entertainment is offered. Its a process of understanding how the community feels about systems the developer is implementing, not a process of literally coding the game.
---
Gnomeregan was in no way out of the way for the Horde. Free teleport from Booty Bay.
---
Yeah thats true he said that, but what you dont realize is how he is contradicting himself. Fact is, if he didnt want problems and wanted to play the game like a normal person, he can. However, he will refuse to not stream the game. Thats fine and all, but be aware of the risks, dont complain about getting ganked on a pvp server. Remember most of us arent getting paid to put up with ganks and play video games all day. 
---
There are always options. Option number one dont stream classic wow, and perhaps stream something else. Option two roll PvE, and stop complaining.
---
Sadly, my guild chose a shitty name. And they voted for it.
---
The name is "Keyboard Assassins".
---
So, I will look for another guild.
---
I can't really play with people that think that "Keyboard Assassins" is a good name for a serious guild, that aims for Server 1st and be among the top ones world-wide.
---
Great pic of undercity! Never seen it like this
---
Not when it comes to bug reports...
---
Yeah I feel you, I have had maybe 2 sodas a year for the last 6-7 years as there have been a few times at a party or bbq where someone forgot to bring bottled water and I don’t drink the tap water in the area I’m from so I would take a soda instead. Ive never been to Wisconsin myself but I have heard of many people drinking soda from that area. I don’t drink alcohol either, I used to, to an excessive point so I ended up deciding to stop drinking anything except water and orange juice because of my lack of self control when I get an itch for soda or alcohol. But these, I would definitely make an exception for!
---
This is just flat out wrong, and has been proven wrong many people multiple times in the past.
---
I won't be taking off the day it releases because it will be a shit show, but I'll have the very next day off when things calm down a little bit more.
---
Likewise, I saw this game like day 5 of playing in 2005. Won a few silver too. Made life as a warrior much better!
---
The point of an mmorpg isnt to just raid. its not a fckin arcade. And yeah.. I would be more impressed by someone wielding Staff of Jordan (No matter if he bought it or looted it) than lets say a tier 1 piece.
---
So I’ve been playing private servers for years because I miss my youth, and not because it’s just a good game ?  Thanks DR I’m glad we got that sorted, (I never played vanilla as a kid, but it still must be nostalgia right)
---
I jump on this reddit, read shit like this, and head back to playing CoH until Classic.
---
God help you people. You need a hobby.
---
Darnassus!
---
&gt;and It would suck to be one shotted by button mashing noobs because they  have 12 hours a day to grind for the best possible gear.
---
You are playing a progression based, time-investment based game.
---
If someone puts in more effort than you, then he will be better than you.
---
Everyone is grinding SM. There are too many people in the world to compete if you dont have a class that can get tags.
---
[I still have one of these cans as memorabilia.](https://imgur.com/gallery/aVr3nhv)
---
I used to have a /y macro on my Rogue to spam when ganking lowbies, it translated out to something like:
---
&gt; Ev er y Ti me Y o u S e e Me Y o u D i e
---
Do you enjoy killing things, though?
---
Korean MMOs have a few identifying factors almost universally across the genre:
---
1. Pay2win - Very nearly every KMMO you play has some degree of pay2win. Whether it comes in the form of small xp or gold boosts or gear enhance % items.
---
2. Extreme RNG gear upgrades. Many Korean games, notably BDO in recent times, have a gear upgrade system that has % chance upgrades. Many also have penalties for failing, ranging from downgrades to losing the item entirely.
---
3. Heavy focus on grinding. A huge amount of PvE gameplay revolves around killing a bunch of monsters over and over. Some, like B&amp;S, have slightly better PvE with dungeons and such but others, like BDO, basically have no PvE content outside the grind.
---
4. Aesthetic. Not necessarily a complaint but be prepared for lots of skimpy dresses, catgirls and ostensibly underage girls.
---
And then look at how many people played BFA compared to Vanilla, and I don't mean every area but they literally revamped old areas in Cataclysm. This concept doesn't seem foreign in the slightest, if new content is being made why can't it interact in old content.
---
Considering that the amount of effort you'll be able to put into grinding gear is a huge determinant of your pvp success, you're gonna run into many people who beat you because they put in more hours.
---
Its an RPG. ROLE PLAYING GAME. It should be like real life in a sense. It should be that those who work harder have more, have better. Go play league if you want even casual play.
---
They were implemented* during vanilla, and then destroyed it.
---
Yeah, it's a *lit* place
---
They murdered Naxx mercilessly in Wrath. That is not what I wish for. I just want reasonable encounter design.
---
Does she have a sister?
---
I mean, druids if you want wipes.
---
Warriors can't miss taunts, lot more consistent.
---
"Disruption / Harassment: Engage in any conduct intended to disrupt or diminish the game experience for other players, or disrupt operation of Blizzard’s Platform in any way, including:
---
Harassment, “griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies."
---
One of the Vanilla Devs (Kevin Jordan) pointed out that the encounter was not designed around eight Prot Warrior tanks, just that the community decided it would be easier to go out &amp; recruit extra tanks than handle the mechanics of the fight with less tanks. Community "gospel" on tank requirement does not equal bad game design, although there could be other reasons.
---
Integrity is violated without question because it changes the player experience **drastically.**   
---
AV was changed multiple times throughout vanilla (like I honestly think it was *literally* every patch) and they had to settle on one version due to logistics and the confusion associated with those kinds of changes. Same goes for things like itemization, something like Bonereaver's Edge was changed 3 times, meaning 4 different versions of it were in vanilla.  
---
As for the faction imbalances and/or population worries, it seems to me that they are deliberately launching fewer servers than they realistically should, which is most likely for many reasons, but for sure to combat this as well.
---
How could I possibly know that when I don't watch streams?
---
My post was based off the OP's video. I don't know if the guy has done it in the past, nor do I know if he will carry on with this idea of his. 
---
All I am saying is that he gave a pretty damn good example of how a streamer could be detrimental to his realm and people not associated with him.
---
And there's tons of games for that? RPGs are purely about progression, not being an FPS or MOBA. I don't see how you can't comprehend that. Sure, I value my priorities, my family, and my job more, so I have a successful career and a home. Live very comfortably.
---
 The people playing 12 hours a day most likely are living at home, aren't bettering their future, and are making basically no progress in life, but are having fun playing their game. At least let them make some type of damn progress on the game they play all day long. 
---
If you truly have enough "skill", then you can outplay people all the time, but if the gear gap is huge, not likely. And it shouldn't be. No reason a fresh 60 should shit on a person who's been raiding for months and has decent gear.
---
So remember how bad you were when you were level 30 on your first ever wow character? These dungeons were designed so that 5 people as bad or worse than that could complete them. Dungeons start to get harder at 40+ and then again spike in difficulty at 60.
---
Does anyone else think it's pathetic to "claim" world firsts for things that were done 14 years ago by people whos job wasn't to be attention whores on the internet?
---
Can you tell me whats wrong with it? I love the angry expression on his face, it looks great
---
No it wont, thats why in my previous comments I said that alone takes a lot of the viability out of the fury tanking spec. Typing /sit to get crit on purpose will no longer proc things like enrage.
---
Good luck on grand marshal.  No class was faster than any other, it was just a matter of playing 18 hours or more per day stomping pugs in WSG or AB and dodging enemy premades for about 2 months straight.
---
Too little. Blizzard has like 1000 managers but less than 100 emplyees actually developing games.
---
You need 8 warrior tanks who all have a 2 piece set bonus that makes em not miss taunt.
---
That's going to take a lot of time to grind out regardless of how much you know about the fight.
---
No it's not
---
 It's not good but it's better than -25 stam
---
"The main path bosses having optional hard modes I recall created friction, with some people wanting to farm content and gear up to make the fights easier first, and others wanting to attempt progression. It was awkward. "
---
This is what I liked.  You had content that gave people different opinions on how to succeed.  It required good guild leadership to see it through.
---
Did they said how many Server they wanna give us and are there specific France servers?
---
I rarely comment on reddit as I'm new to the platform.
---
This post made me pretty emotional ngl. Reminds me of the endless gaming hours during the summer I would have during my highschool years. 
---
Thanks for this post!
---
Dude, yeah, that hit me.  Wow.  I never realized how much you spend on this game over time.
---
The again, I've spent way more than that on certain stupid mobile games that I didn't enjoy nearly as much or as long.
---
NO CHANGES YOU TROGLADITE
---
Stop roasting Darnassus!
---
2 Grulls 1 Cup
---
No it doesn’t clear stuns.  And a full bm hunter will have imp mend pet which removes roots.  The mage is GOING to get stunned by the hunter pet.  If he wastes his nova on just the pet then the hunter is going to kite the mage to hell and back.  If the mage is forced to blink on the hunter the hunter can stun the mage.  The hunter shouldn’t be popping BW off the gate they need to wait for the mage to pop something like nova, blink, or something of that nature and the mage is in trouble.
---
Hate to break it to you, but you can’t just que battlegrounds while questing. You have to have somebody ina main city to que you, and as soon as it’s done you get ported to wherever you were qued from. By the time you fly back to your questing zone the next battleground que will pop.
---
Maybe a little. I feel like it’s a product of the way they are retro fitting in spell batching. Feel like it just need a to be tightened up a bit. Noticed it on chat too. Like hit enter and there is a full beat before it hits the chat box.
---
Someone asked when each class starts feeling like it has its own identity. Here is reply, hope it helps.
---
Hunter - level 10 you get a pet, easy mode from there
---
Warlock - about level 17 whey you get fully talented Improved Voidwalker and you can actually do damage. Level 40 you get a free mount.
---
Mage - level 20 you get Blizzard and have an option to start AOE grinding.
---
Priest - level 40 you get shadow form and can start using your abilities instead of Wanding 
---
Shaman - levle 20 you get ghost form (insane for traveling), level 30 you get Windfury (let the RNG fun begin) level 40 you get stormstrike (more fun)
---
Paladin -  level 20 you get seal of command (welcome to the fun world of RNG). level 40 you could go Prot and just AOE grind, also you get a free mount.
---
Rogue - Level 20 you get crippling poison level 26 you get cheashot and level 30 kidney shot. You are now a rogue.
---
Druid - Level 10 bear, level 20 cat, level 30 travel, and a lot more abilities in between.  
---
Warrior - level 1 you come to a realization everyone and everything will shit on you in this game. Level 60 and gear you are GOD and you will now shit on everything and everyone. Top DPS, only Tank, King of group PVP.
---
Have fun
---
I don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t keep Classic unbastardized by modern developers, and release TBC server options as well. It’s truly a win win... Classic fans get Classic, and nothing that made Classic great gets sidelined by new content. TBC fans (many of which will still also play Vanilla) get to play TBC for the things that made it great. 
---
I’d rather have two excellent games than one mashed-together one, please.
---
Indeed, counting every hour :(
---
"stuck" having played both in vanilla with decursive it was super easy. I detected a bit of a joke though. During curse fights, just click the button a few times, done.
---
I like it. I may steal that idea.
---
&gt;Anyone that tries to argue that it should be 50g because it's a great gold sink is an idiot. Anyone that says a lower cost makes the game easier is fucking retarded.
---
You just pointed out why you shouldn't be taken serious, and your post downvoted.
---
I am glad you wasted all that time typing.
---
I dont see what's subjective about harassing a player on the same faction. In this case it was clear se faction harrassment. Its indefensible.
---
Do yourself a favor and don't look up how much the first apple computer sold for.
---
yea i know raids will be hard enough for most casuals. 
---
although doing BWL before nef slips you the note is decently hard
---
Idk why but I like payo the most. Seems like a guy I’d chill with irl and constantly joke with. Come to NY payo I got blunts
---
Get the picture. He wants to play the game like a normal player, but is not going to stop streaming. Does this makes sense to you? 
---
There are plenty of places he can hide if hes NOT streaming. There are risks, but him complaining with a salary that is next level  to sit and play video games in front of a camera, should come with a lot more of a humble attitude, rather than an elitst, condiscending one.
---
Some stuff only drops in dungeons (ie Righteous Orbs for a high end weapon enchant). Then in a later patch they added quests to upgrade the dungeon sets to "tier 0.5". Also some dungeons have BiS gear such as Hand of Justice.
---
And there's no possible way there will be any new players who never experienced Vanilla?
---
I can agree with it being against the spirit of the game. I just don't think that something like this warrants real punishment. At the end of the day, my opinion on an event can dtermine how I feel about said event. What if (for some ungodly reason) a group of 5 decided they were going to grind Stranglethorn tigers all day, and I needed to get the quest done to progress? Should I be able to report these players? In their minds, they are grinding for efficiency. In my mind, they are making it impossible for me to move forward/enjoy the game. I think what happened is exactly what should have happened. A GM gets that report ticket, and corrects the issue on the spot. They don't ban an account because a bunch of people felt slighted.
---
for the average guild paladins just did what shamans did but much better.  the rank 1 flash heal spam was really powerful buffering for tanks that might get multiple crits or crushing blows in a row.  Dwarf fear ward was able to have tanks focus on holding threat instead of making sure to use berserker's rage in zerker stance.  all in all, for top end guilds it won't matter they will both be on the same path and time line, but the average alliance guild would be able to make it further than the average horde guild.
---
Are you a streamer zealot?
---
I still have mine from 09. Why would I want any more?
---
You missed the memo. We all saw it.
---
Could you generate the same amount of  media attention though?
---
Haven't played retail since Legion.
---
I'll save my tears for when Classic actually comes out and they fuck shit up. People need to stop panicking.
---
Well yeah I meant in terms of Premades/BGs
---
It was thoroughly tested at 30 when everyone was grinding for gear. Of course I'm sure you knew that already because you've been following along. However its actually being tested less because everyone goes in kills the trash exists and resets the instance. So yea actually less productive testing. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
And then remember that it is impossible to separate dislike of specific game changes from our own personal burnout at having played this game for however long we have played it. And the way I know that is that, I played alongside players who's first experience in wow was Battle for Azeroth and they had a blast.
---
And yes, they revamped leveling content in cataclysm and that was fun. What was that not enough for you? Should they be revamping that same level and content every single expansion? In order to keep it the most fresh? Should they keep revamping every single expansions content in order to represent time passing and changes occurring?
---
That would literally mean that every successive expansion requires more time and effort put into it, just to update all the content before the newest expansion.
---
The forbidden fruit?
---
I'll give you a hint since you're part of this subreddit and don't need to watch streamers to know about them, it's 0.
---
yeah but anyone who beats me is just a noob who has no life &gt;:(
---
WotLK did start many of the directional changes towards today, but most fans of Classic also appreciate WotLK for its strengths. Personally, it’s easily the weakest of the trilogy, but I still want to play it for its strong points. I am a little bit #Changes for Wrath, but I think a very few select changes could go a long way for the longevity of Wrath.
---
Shouldn't increased time-investment be reflected in superior skill, if the game is well-designed?  What's the point in have an artificial advantage?
---
Pushing to the absolute max doesn't apply to you, given the fact you are even asking this question.
---
Crafting, so while you sit outside the raid instance waiting for an invite you can make stuff.
---
"Blackrock Mountain Swim Team". Or some variation off.
---
Yes, because comparing a time when the term "consumer electronics" didn't even exist, and Apple has to hand-craft every single machine, using parts that were expensive af because there wasn't even a market for mass producing memory or CPUs for anything other than hulking big business computers, is tremendously useful...
---
Deciding between rogue, lock and huntard. I'll probably have to roll a dice or something.
---
It makes perfect sense? Just because you are streaming doesn't mean you have to get people follow you around like mongoloids. That happens in some games where people can but he has streamed all kinds of games where it doesn't happen. He's committed to streaming as his career, if he were to take off 1 year to play classic like a normal person he would lose his job and career. He has to stream and suffer the consequences. He's not complaining or trying to be entitled, he just wishes he could be normal and a streamer at once, that's literally it.
---
For a fresh 60, just grind as many high level quests that you can find. The xp is converted to gold if you are already 60 and you can sell anything that drops.
---
For a long-term grind, just pick a good high level zone (EPL, Winterspring, etc) and grind away on your mob of choice and you can make decent gold off of the drops.
---
no idea what this means?
---
Or, and hang with me here - this might be difficult for you, most of the streamers are asses and idiots and there are folks who are actually good?
---
Nah. It's just easier to hate on everyone!
---
Madseason is totally just like Toweldry or Asmongold! Totally, bro! Yeah!
---
Way to lump everyone together, genius. SMDH.
---
I mean I said the same thing for TBC, I believe if they chase after expansions in any sense, they need to make changes to power creep to allow the entire game viability and longevity. I have zero issues with WotLK, it was the finale of a ten year story. I just don't believe it was something that was healthy for WoW as a whole.
---
[Classic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0)
---
If you're only interested in BG PvP I highly recommend keeping your character at level 49 and playing in that bracket. Takes very little time investment to get BiS gear, while still having 99% of the same abilities and options as level 60 player.
---
if you make 1 million dollars a year irl and want to buy a Bentley you shouldnt be able too. Go to the shop and craft it yourself.
---
What the fuck does that even mean? No one has ever pushed lvl 40 to the max skill and gear along with the rest of the server...you nerds are the worst with ur shit answers.
---
You're right. But I dont think blizz has said anything about hard and fast rules. It's up to their discretion. And that's fine because you cant really make hard and fast rules about these things.
---
Something need doing?
---
Nah, /u/Theophilyps done did it!
---
so you dont think they have influence over other testers not streaming that see what they're doing and decide to do it to because its the path of least resistance (fastest way to 40)?
---
Well, you can. Just not on the same PvP server. But at least you can participate in 2 different communities.
---
You can play 1 in a heavy streamer server and the other in a no streamer server and have both experiences.
---
I’ve listened to every episode, and I generally like the show, but for the first time I had to turn this one off because the guests were so insufferable during the harassment discussion.
---
I remember from back in Vanilla.  Has always been stupid.
---
That was the gist of it.
---
Just watch different streamers then
---
let me know when you find one. I'd like to watch it.
---
I think corpse camping and ganking needs more specific rules in regards to *HOW* it is happening. A streamer telling his 5,000 viewers to add someone to their KOS list is major griefing and an abuse of their community power. A streamer who camps and ganks someone entirely in-game only and without having viewers pour in to help us not griefing. That's just 1 example.
---
Needs more praising of the sun... Wait a minute, this isn't Dark Souls
---
I never said anything of the sort, I didn't say they need to revamp every single zone. I'm saying they can implement new content in old areas, obviously what you purposed is unrealistic but I don't mean to do that either. I'm saying that content needs to have longevity and if new content is created in old content then it gives reasons to be in older zones and to explore the world more.
---
'What if Classic was Classic Remastered?' I wouldn't be able to play it because of my potato PC...
---
&gt;paying $15 for 3 beers when you can buy a case of high life for $12 
---
come on man
---
I duo grinded to rank13 and my friend got rank14 so idk what this means.
---
Any idea who was Alliance first 40?
---
They have enough marketing as it is right now for 0 cost. There are dozens of people streaming to thousands of viewers. WoW has been on the top row of twitch since classic beta released. You also have even more people making videos on YouTube.
---
It is not alliance exclusive. 
---
But yeah you are spot on here. Enchanting early for the smoking mountain something trinket is a must, other than that blacksmithing works nice but rest is optional. I doubt you'll even need engineering as a feral druid. So #OP pick something gold related like skinning herbing mining and/or pick something for the guild like blacksmithing leatherworking and enchanting. 
---
LW+BS sounds sick honestly if you can live without profession for money, this way you can get double value from thorium brotherhood rep.
---
It's a completely different flavor
---
When you hit the level cap (previously 30, now 40) the quests give bonus gold instead of experience.  Many of the streamers had done a few levels worth of quests at lvl 30 for gold.  When they hit 40, there will be an even bigger need for gold since they will need their mounts.
---
Don't even get me started on repair costs...
---
Hurricane's [trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNOxz9paA6E) for classic wow raid dungeons are amazing. If you haven't seen them definitely check them out.
---
&gt;if the game is well-designed? 
---
Define "well designed".
---
Well designed as a FPS or combat game? Yes, it should.
---
Well designed as an RPG based on character progression via loot, with barely any mechanics? Nope, why would it?
---
It seems to me, and this is not trying to put you off anything, that you are looking for an "even playfield", in which the sole deciding factor is skill.
---
**That is not World of Warcraft Classic, and never has been.**
---
I can be a keyboard-turning clicker, but if I'm in T2 gear, and you are in blues, I will very likely wreck you, no matter how skilled you are.
---
That's the way this game works.
---
From what alot of people have been saying is that the dungeons seem very easy atm in the beta
---
Glorious!
---
One could queue for AB while questing in the area tho, I totally forgot about that tbh but there are still a few scenarios where I wasn't a total baffoon there lol
---
I recognized people back when battlegroups were a thing, and I didn't even pvp all that much.
---
I am very tempted to play a druid as I prefer world pvp and battle grounds. I never got to end game content in vanilla as i was only ~14.
---
How is boomkin for level 60 pvp? I am between that and an elemental Shaman but I've never touched shaman before.
---
Thanks now I have to get this paragraph tattooed on my arm because it’s so real.

I thought this was good, I dunno...
---
Retro is just a shit server rly. Obviously 150 is noticeably but probably not as bad as you are used to on retro.
---
Just be sure you're not forcing yourself into a faction for friends that won't play the game for more than 2 weeks. Classic isn't for everyone.
---
Resto shaman or tank warrior?
---
I will play mostly in a group with my brother, who will 99% play a warrior. While he is a rather good tank, he does hate it and prefers to play as a fury. 
---
I for myself like to play something more supportive. I played a holy paladin on private servers and enjoyed the healing part. The inability to farm and long waiting times for groups caused by the lack of willing tanks not so much. I reckon shaman/warrior is an awesome combination for leveling and dungeons but I have the suspicion that it would end the same as with my paladin especially considering the prohibitive respec cost. 
---
On the other hand a tank is always needed and I enjoyed it very much to lead and tank 10man groups in bc onwards. While I do not have the aspiration to be a main tank in 40s, a spot as second or third tank and mting the occasional zg/aq would be right up my alley.  As for race I'm a little torn in regards of the warrior. My shaman would be a female orc, just because. For warrior I also tend towards orc but for tanking it may not be the best compared to humans and their support for tank weapons. Tauren would be my second choice and troll third, where troll should be a preferable choice for tanking they look borderline stupid to me. I don't care for undead.

The problem with FF14's good graphics is how they split the zones into little areas seperated by loading screens. WoW was able to create a truly open wold, which gave a great sense of immersion that ff14 just can't achieve (But I do like ff14s, for other reasons)
---
yeah im sure retail wow is great despite the character models. Who doesn’t love doing island expeditions and warfronts, farming azerite gear and can’t forget titanforging. Clearing the same raid on 4 difficulties is so fun. Forced personal loot is pretty cool too.
---
yeah... lol. i guess i poked the hornets nest.
---
So true. The groups I was in were comprised of two groups. One group knew it was a waste of time and wanted to continue the dungeon, the other group wanted to clean off their collection of grimy rocks for 10 minutes.
---
The boys and me
---
would be correct way innit?
---
I can't think of a time where players have griefed their faction and actually gotten banned or suspended but for much more grievous offenses. I genuinely believe the outcry from people saying that this guy shoould be suspsended or banned is just a bunch of streamer fans who are parroting streamer sentiments.
---
The player that brought the ZG debuff to Org, no ban, no suspension.
---
The numerous players who have kited elitesand world bosses to cities, questing hubs, etc. No bans, no suspensions.
---
Warlocks how have reptedly summoned Doomguards in Goldshire/Crossroads, no bans, no suspensions.
---
Under the "you shouldn't grief your own faction" argument I could make a case that Asmongold shuld be banned or suspended for Kiting the green dragon to SW during the beta. I think that arguement is stupid beyond belief, but it still exists.
---
&gt;I think it’d be pretty successful in drawing the attention of ex-wow players.
---
Let me put it this way:
---
When I logged in this morning, this sub had 127k users. We are now at 129k, probably gonna break 130 tonight.
---
I think they have all the marketing they need.
---
But Mythic+ is great huh? Good shit
---
Omfg yes. I want that fucking cherry citrus so bad.. I crave it!!!!
---
I meant going out. I could just buy a half gal of bottom shelf vodka if I'm just trying to get fucked up for the cheapest price possible.
---
blizz doesn't need to spend a penny on marketing, everyone who plays wow or played wow knows about classic. i don't think classic is going to appeal to players not already experienced with warcraft, and if it does, it's a very small amount of people.
---
If you are a dick in your PvP team you get kicked and replaced though.
---
Not a problem for me tbh. My pocket healer is a priest and they're super efficient levelers, not as much as druid but not bad. 
---
Plus if he gets ganked and I'm 10 lvls ahead I'll come avenge him. 
---
Also I have a gf and he doesn't so that'll slow me down tbh
---
example? I couldnt figure it out, Usally focus, focus target, Target, Target of Target, and what not are interface options. Focus defiantly isn't in the beta interface, if you can script it, that would be a bug that should probably be removed.
---
Then MMORPG's are not games for you.
---
Unfortunately for you you'll never have the Ashbringer in classic.  Of course it was in the game.  It was the hardest legendary to get.  It required years of work harder than anything ever put in the game.  There was only one person in the whole game who got the legendary Ashbringer and unfortunately it wasn't me.  It required having the corrupted Ashbringer and the phylactery  of the Lich  Timolain  which you can find in WPL.  Once you have the phylactery and the Corrupted Ashbringer you could do a series of quests started in Scarlet Monastery Graveyard from one of the rare bosses who is friendly to you once you wield the Corrupted Ashbringer with teh phylactery of Timolain.  You gather a HUGE amount of materials and they will help you create the Ashbringer.  But you aren't done!  You must go back in time and talk to Highlord Mograine in the Old Hillsbrad Foothills in the TBC expansion and you have a scripted event.  He can't believe the essence of light  has been used to create a sword.  However he the sword still isn't completely clean! It still has some darkness in it and he tells you to seek out a blood elf who ends up being in the Outlands.  This elf eventually tells you of the ressurection of Kel'thuzad at the Sunwell.  You need to ressurect the dead Lich Timolain just like they did for Kel'thuzad in WC3.  The only place it could be done was in the Sunwell.   You need to fully clear the raid and summon the Lich.  You have to fight the Lich Timolain at first but they give up and are willing to help you.  The sword was transformed into Ashbringer God Sword still legendary.  If you bring this sword with you to fight the Lich King in ICC you will have a scripted event where he will engage on you and you don't need to use any threat abilities.  He will stay on you no matter your threat table.  If you manage to kill him in this hyper form which is harder than the normal heroic 25 man, you will plunge the Ashbringer God Sword in the Frozen Throne and it will turn into Ashmourne Forever the first artifact weapon in the game.  Sorry for you and all of us I made this all up.

Stuck between Hunter and Mage.
---
While 90% of my end-game will be dedicated to PvP, I'm worried about the Hunter's lack of groups for raids/dungeons for preBiS gearing and general raid content. I enjoy the Hunter playstyle more than the Mage, but I'm worried that I'll spend my limited in-game time sitting in cities waiting for group invites.
---
Let me know when you find one. Several others appear to be looking as well in this thread.
---
Id say it deserves a house, its to good for a trailer
---
Yeah... there's only one problem with your theory. If I wanted to play BFA, I would be playing BFA right now. BFA is currently available, so, why would I have to wait for them to bring back classic, play classic and be disappointed, and then go play BFA? I would just play BFA - right now. 
---
So I think your theory is...... faulty, to put it politely.
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER
---
Prob wasn’t paying attention to what I was responding to tbh rofl
---
No, it makes it a great opportunity to get frustrated if you can't get tags. You basically need hunters, mages etc getting tags so you can progress.
---
No he did not see it and they should have tried “another way” before just murdering civilians who hadnt turned yet. Women and children.  If Arthas didnt commit the massacre he may not have been broken and turned into the Lich King. That was the moment that really broke him. Losing his humanity in an attempt to “save” his people
---
Exactly. I worry a lot of people are going to burn out if they rush to 60 as fast as possible and do it by playing every spare minute. I’m going to try to take my time and have fun along the way. If I spend a week hanging around a dungeon and running it two or three times that’s cool. If I don’t level as fast as others because I’m getting materials for my professions, that’s cool too. I want to enjoy 1-60 and then see what I feel like doing once I get there.
---
Make sure you post it so we know.
---
Can this be the subreddits guild?
---
Must be nice only having 4 abilities to press like you’re a league of legends champion strolling around Azeroth.
---
This is genius and I will be doing this.
---
Probably not shadow priest but everything else yes.
---
Good to hear. I think at this point I know what spec of Druid I want to play and level, so probably no reason to keep playing it.
---
I still don't get your argument here. I get why they are running SM. Its an easier grind and so forth, but ok?
---
Quit complaining.  Farm gold, find a better hybrid spec, or figure out a way to make your spec work for what you want it to do.
---
Yeah, I just dont want to be left out of pve for not being human :(
---
&gt;Maybe showing some Classic content, best of pvp and beta scenes.
---
Excuse me, are you trying to suggest that [this annoying face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEqNn43f9Xs) is somehow better than [the most epic intro to any game ever?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0)
---
I’m seriously considering doing dwarf paladin with mining/blacksmithing and taking this route.
---
I would highly suggest questing in duo instead of 5 mans. the number of collection and unique drop quests is very high and having even 3 players can slow down the quest grind and not provide enough monsters to kill in the area.  Perhaps one of the hunter or warlocks could go by soloing since they have such high sustain with the pet.  
---
Druid is pretty good, but they suck because they have a long cooldown on resurrect for when people die.  Druids had movement, but as for play style "versatility" they were pretty much innervate batteries and the rest of their talents didn't affect the raid much because they were below average in dps, tanking, and healing.  In pvp they shined because they could get away or close gaps quickly.
---
It isn't,both are asinine.
---
Damn that’s a big jump between stocks and ZF...no SM at least? :(
---
But gnomes are far better in pvp :/
---
It’s not that priest is bad.  Mind Control exploits, fear bombs, offensive dispels, etc. are all great.  Priest is a more “aggressive” choice, while Paladin is almost 100% defensive, and the “defensive” healer comp will usually win in a team fight.  
---
Remember, there aren’t a slew of knock backs, stuns, or other means of peeling like there are in Live.  You’re going to face tank that rogue for some amount of time.
---
That being said, you will always play better on a class you enjoy.  If you want to MC people off ledges, you’ll find a way to make priest work against that rogue.
---
You know there's plenty of people who play games that don't visit Twitch, right?

There's a large amount of psychology articles you could read about why people follow celebrities that will be much more informative than anything you'll get here.

Crap, you're right. I didn't even think about later seasons. That being said, he's absolutely correct being that they're both still going and SP is still good.

Yeah everyone knows that lore.  You cannot fault the humans who barely survived two wars with bloodthirsty demon infused orcs. Uther and Arthas were still fighting them during Warcraft 3 as they were sacrificing innocents.

There are answers to most of your questions but they are so basic that its best you google/research by yourself because i doubt anyone will answer in detail. Mage/rogue/warr are most popular for a reason and GM is the same for everyone
---
I enjoyed the changes they made in cataclysm classic in order to spruce up old zones, but I did not need them to do that. I still found plenty of enjoyment in the classic zones and the classic quests and found plenty of value in returning to those places.
---
I mean you talk about needing reasons to get out in the world, when those reasons are personal player choice. We'll look at Warlords of Draenor, they made a humongous world with lots of awesome things to explore, but people fell back on the excuse that their garrisons were prison because they felt like they had to stay in their garrisons and print gold all the time. In order to keep up with everyone else. But they didn't have to do that, they could have gone out into the world and explored. Nobody was keeping them in any prison.
---
We saw that the beginning of cataclysm was the high point in population. After that, we really begin to see the effects of large-scale MMO burnout. Where no matter what changes blizzard implemented, players were going to grow tired of content faster because they were burned out. There is no magic formula blizzard can adhere to that will keep players interested and playing forever, the human brain does not work that way.
---
Harassment, “griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, **conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others**, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies.
---
grats he got $2k for being the first lev-oh wait.
---
Trying to only do optimal play 100% of time leads to burnout. Stop and smell the roses
---
The cost is to discourage constant respeccing. This way, instead of someone you know swapping from what smwould have been a dps, you find a new person to heal. The cost starts low so you can fix something if you make a choice you don't like, or intend to try something new for a while. Changing the cost absutely alters gameplay, and it cost that much through BC.
---
Well I don’t think tbc or Wrath necessarily have to mean anything in relation to WoW as a whole. If six years from now we have Classic, TBC, and Wrath to play? I don’t think I would ever unsub. They all have their flaws, but they have so many strengths, and those strengths would only shine if they are kept *seperate*. If they’re combined, it’s just a diluted slosh of all three, and what made each one good will be lost in the process.
---
Private reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
A couple of things:  First, you're right that the new badge gear might have been a little crazy for how easy it was to get, but it was only something like 3 slots.
---
H MGT was HARD if you weren't already overgeared for it.  I raided Vanilla-MOP with the exception of BC, so I recognize that while it was less "earned" than raid gear, H MGT was balanced such that a "max geared" *dungeon* player had to work their ass off to successfully finish and earn that gear.  H MGT was literally meant for a player like me to catch up if I ever did want to raid, and it was not easy free gear.
---
And finally, even if you disagree with everything else I stated, if "BC Classic" ever comes out, IoQ won't be available right away if they copy their phasing strategy from Classic.  They'll presumably try to re-create the progression of BC just like they are with Vanilla/Classic, so you won't hit 70 and just start farming MGT like you fear.

I was once in a guild "JFK Was PvP Flagged". It never got reported.

I played on a medium pop server during vanilla with about 55-45 A:H split. As alliance the queues for WSG/AB never exceeded 15min between 8am - 2am. Usually popping around the 5-10min mark. AV was a bit more unpredictable. Once crossrealm BGs were implemented I never saw the top horde guild again which was sad because I really, REALLY enjoyed killing them. I also never saw that human mage Nintendonick who grinded out R14 solo because the alliance premades didn't really like him. 
---
The only crossrealm BGs I support would be premade v premade 10v10, 15v15.

layering isn't dynamic like shards, it's set.

So they best you could do is try to find someone in a different layer via chat, and have them pull you to their layer.

Did you really just lay out phases for a conspiracy theory like you know fuck all about anything?
---
I feel like level 60 Heroic versions of some leveling dungeons could be a lot of fun. Not necessary though.
---
I don't think its healthy to alienate the people that want a new route for the progression of WoW from the classic WoW community. I still love classic and I want to be able to feel like a part of this community as well, even if I'm looking at the future of it in a different light.

Berserker rage = immune to fear
---
There is like a 15 second window you could fear them when it’s on cool down though. Also fury warriors get death wish which makes you immune to fear. Most warriors in PvP will be arms though. Warrior trinket does not break fear

---
pvp on a pvp server is pvp. intentionally following someone to gank them for days is against the tos.

Your argument is that the quests aren't being tested, but I'm saying that a lot of quests will be tested because they will do them for gold after hitting 40.
---
Phase 3* with BWL, not Phase 2.
---
Anybody who used to play WoW and still has an interest in playing video games already knows about classic WoW and already knows if they're going to play or not.
---
Ah I didn’t realize. It’s been quite sometime since I’ve played vanilla other than pserver and never actually had a legendary item
---
Has anyone had success in getting back a character from pre-battle.net? I'm being told by support that they were able to find my character but it's attached to another account.
---
They’re not though. Group XP isn’t an even split, they’ll each get roughly 28% of the experience a solo player would get per mob, meaning they only have to kill about 70% of the same amount of creates for equal experience.
---
As someone wanting to main a hunter it sucks....
---
true, he seems to show a pretty good amount of interest in classic but he mostly wants a TBC relaunch. I think he will stick with it for a while. That's why I think I can just level a horde on a different server when I'm not playing with him.  Initially he was going to play druid but now he is trying to decide between priest and druid. I am all for druids and bah humbug on the nay sayers.

I'm just following the [meme guidelines.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/me-and-the-boys)
---
Get another person to go warlock, and now you only need to buy 3 mounts instead of 4?
---
Short answer: Mining &gt; Herbalism.
---
Long answer:
---
Mining will generally get you more money.  More professions need mining, and to get the most out of mining you have to go out of your way, so people may end up neglecting it (leading to someone who farms minerals to have a bigger market and less competition).  I believe mining will take up less space in your bags, because you're stacking 2 metals and 2 rocks, instead of a spattering of herbs.
---
Because mining is more involved, herbing is easier to level, and easier to farm while you're busy questing and grinding.  Herbing is also easier to get the most out of each node, because it takes several swings to get all the ore out of a mineral node, but only one time to pick a flower (unless the attempt fails).  
---
If you go specifically to casually farm, mining is better.  If you want something to do while you grind something else, herbing is better.
---
no this was not on lvl 30. its not on the beta.
---
Holy shit they look great
---
Or claim an achievement on a game that’s not even released yet. That’s what is pathetic
---
I get what your saying but some of the videos out there seeing it in action show otherwise.
---
He's 100% right he can't be any more so. They invited them to get views.
---
They had berserker rage ability that would make them immune to fear for 10 seconds.  If they were being feared, berserker rage would break it and then make them immune for 10 seconds.
---
use this F R F K  J o A A F 101 101
---
Streamers were invited by the marketing department. Everyone else was invited by the QA department. I wouldn't worry about what the "personalities" are doing.
---
All of this gets tested from clearing the first few trash pacts?
---
technically classic is different than vanilla so when rag dies it will be a world first classic kill, not a world first vanilla kill. there are going to be guild rankings for classic, like they existed in wow, like a "ladder" which will be reset when compared to vanilla. so when someone does kill onyxia for the first time in classic, technically it will be a world first classic kill. it just won't be as exciting because, yeah, it's been done already when the game was a lot harder back then
---
Technically you can do this fight with four tanks and have them rotate instead of swapping out tanks. However this requires running the bosses past each and bad execution or an unlucky string of hits will absolutely destroy your run.
---
This. Level a bit, then catch up the crafting a bit. Or not, whatever is fun for them
---
This is Vanilla.  The journey is hard, and Shaman/Warrior is one of if not the best Horde leveling duos.
---
Windfury.  ‘Nuff said.  Your brother is going to love the free 20% damage increase.  Did I mention the heals?  Yea, that’s right.  You can convert mana into damage more efficiently than anyone else by keeping a warrior healed...especially a warrior with Windfury
---
Will he have to tank the five mans?  Yea, but it’s totally fine to do that as Fury.  You often don’t even need a shield, so it’s just “DPS’ing with aggro.”
---
The boys and I
---
&gt; Stuff like having the hairstyles that they added (in wrath?) would change absolutely nothing gameplay-wise.
---
I think it could change gameplay indirectly. Certain races might become more appealing if they have more/different hair options. People for whom that matters redistribute based on the new options, and class distributions change as a result as well (since race/class are quite restricted in Classic compared to BFA).       
---
        
---
So if they playerbase is comprised of a different distribution of classes, your experience in forming groups will be significantly affected. Some classes will be more  prevalent, some less. All because of the hold-outs that would never play an orc due to a receding hairline, or a tauren because they have pretty poor cosmetic options in general.        
---
            
---
Also, wrath haircuts, especially spiky human male haircuts, would feel horribly anachronistic. If I saw a human run by with that haircut there's no way it'd feel classic to me. That style is synonymous with newer WoW, and would be out of place in Classic.

I know that on Monday under this subreddit they do a guild recruitment post where you can advertise your guild or yourself, that's where I may start. Can also turn to the official forums but I don't know if you will find the people you want to play with there. Third option is to join a private server and try to meet a guild that will be moving over to official forums on release. I'm currently doing the first and third option myself. Hope this helps.
---
Also, [here's the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bx0i98/one_last_time_lets_do_this/) I saw people asking for a Horde version, and did my best.
---
phone auto correct rofl
---
power user hahahaha
---
The most common move every warrior will use is berserker rage.  This is unavoidable if they enter berserker stance as it also breaks fear from my knowledge.  For fury warriors they also hve an ability called death wish I believe that also breaks and make them immune to fears.  
---
Honestly, fearing a warrior is the least reliable cc you can use on them.  There’s really no avoiding or working around it besides simply making them use that cd
---
I assume you mean arms warriors.  Their only ability to remove fears is recklessness which is the 30 min cooldown, and bersker rage which is a 30second cooldown 10 second buff. You need to be in berserker stance to use any of these abilities, so if you catch a warrior in another stance he won't have any options to get out of it as the insignia does not remove fears for warriors. 
---
But for paladin and warrior specifically you will have a hard time. Your fears can be dispelled by the paladin, and blessing of sacrifise means if you damage the warrior, the paladin takes a bit of damage. This makes hard cc very hard to do especially with paladin bubble.
---
Did you mean to say unitframe instead of nameplate? I was not aware you could use clique on actual nameplates in any version of the game. 
---
Anyways you will be able to use clique with elvui unitframes 100%. I’ve been able to do that in vanilla, tbc and wotlk private servers and I see absolutely no reason why a shitty back ported version of the addon would have a functionality that an official classic release of ElvUI wouldn’t.
---
Literally installed it a few days ago only because I wanted to verify some stuff about a class I wanted to level.
---
Couldn't one argue that if things were tested perhaps there could be a valid need to increase spawns in these areas that maybe considered bottle necks?
---
Highest level pvp for each level bracket.
---
&gt; Players flooding or otherwise interfering with the auction house with no intention of making money, just to make it unusable 
---
There is nothing wrong with that and it happens in real life markets as well. 
---
&gt;This exact example at hand: players of the same faction who are egregiously disrupting a widely organized activity with no intention of contributing 
---
If you want to host a community event, you have to deal with ALL of the community. There is no reason why you (or streamers) should have special treatment for events like this. 
---
&gt;Actions that are taken outside of the intentions of the game that cause a major disruption to gameplay, where the players at hand have no reasonable way to avoid it.
---
This is the only one I can agree with.
---
&gt;If the game is well-designed
---
We're talking about WoW right? Maybe the single must successful PC game ever?
---
&gt;They could have gone to any number of places with higher level mobs that weren't neutral areas which would have prevented a level 1 character from accessing those areas.

---
Also the best /train in the game.
---
I remember that in vanilla, priest could MC other faction and speak to them using /me. Do you know if it is still something in classic ?
---
Sounds like you need to stick to retail there buddy.
---
Classic doesn't sound like the game for you; stop trying to change it into what you want and let people who like it how it is enjoy it.
---
But does it stack with cheetah (minor run speed enchant)?
---
Well it depends on how you measure.
---
Stormlingx spent a ton of time testing all the possible jumps in WSG to figure out which ones work in classic compared to other versions. It caused a big stink in WSG because they really wanted him to "test" capturing the flag instead.
---
This is fundamentally untrue, Classic WoW has trended as the most popular thing on twitch multiple times, where as current content WoW was largely neglected. There was a burnout because of the lack of content more than anything else. WoD had a 14 month content drought, that is inexcusable for any video game that is still being updated. The drive was destroyed not because of time, but because of the changes that lead WoW to the husk of its original form. It's not about the amount of world to explore, its about the things that make that world worth exploring.
---
The only problem here is that curbing this behavior is completely possible. But they would need to turn off their streams, which they don't want to do. If a player followed you around the game for days on end, what is the actual effect on gameplay? If you consistently get camped each day (which happens on imblanced servers) Should I be able to report every single person doing this? 
---
I feel like this is just because Soda is a streamer, and outside of the use case this is a moot point
---
I think the only reason it's optimal is because of competition for objectives and the massive amount of world PvP going on, if you were alone on the server I think questing or aoe farming is faster still
---
Throughout playing Vanilla to WotLK, I have never seen anyone ninja loot anything and I had about 600 days played in these 3 expansions.  
---
Raid loot was always masterloot and even in VoA with pugs I never saw people abusing ML.  
---
Sure it can happen I'm not denying that but it is extremely rare.
---
If he's truly out to ruin it, he'll get banned. End of story.
---
Just keep in mind that intentionally disrupting the game experience of others is against the tos. Grief people at your own risk.
---
if he wants to play like a "normal player" why doesn't he just turn his stream off? fact is he wants all the benefits of streaming and none of the downsides.
---
98% yep.  The 2% nope...
---
Ulduar had the best hard mode system the game has ever seen, and everything after that is a pale echo of a lost future.
---
Heroic dungeons as implemented in TBC made all dungeons relevant at level cap.  Someone who skipped SFK at 25 or Maraudon at 45, if there were Heroic dungeons, could do so at 60.
---
However, starting with Mists, every time I've tried to play the game I've burned out because at some point in the difficulty climb I lost my motivation and immersion.
---
I'm super torn between DPS human warrior (willing to tank dungeons/off tank) and gnome mage. Warrior is going to be so difficult but I've played a warrior almost my entire life (except cata where I played a mage).
---
I'll probably have both but idk which to main.
---
I think you accidentally'd all of you words.
---
Bunch of friends, friends of friends and some other people I'm grouping up with are all voting rolling Alliance...
---
Meaning I'll be a solo shaman on Horde side.
---
Blood and Thunder, y'all!
---
Could not an addon help?
---
Cmon man, an entry level Specialized mountain bike is $999. That's engineered and built to a way higher standard than a monitor stand, with way more complexity like 10 speed transmissions, hydraulic brakes, shock absorbers, heavy duty aluminum frame.
---
The reason this monitor stand costs $999 is because it costs $999.
---
Ten is a bit much? Don’t you mean the opposite? People aren’t going to pay you if you can’t guarantee them a smooth run, and you can’t guarantee a smooth run if you only have 10/40 people geared
---
Perhaps over some but do you know how boring that is? There’s thousands of people playing this, most wont have the will to make it to 40 strictly running SM. A bug report looks the same no matter who sends it. I think its cool that you can rush through those levels that quickly in classic if you’re masochistic enough.
---
I dont like it either.
---
Sorry but I find that very hard to believe, unless you played on a dead server back then. Either way, it ain't gonna happen this time buddy and cross-realm is going to happen whether you like it or not.
---
Yeah But there’s millions of people that visit twitch everyday. They have been giving access to streamers who don’t normally play WoW and bringing it more audiences. And there’s millions more visiting YouTube that can see videos created by the community.  They could spend the money to make new videos or just let people keep doing what they are doing and bringing in free advertising.
---
If you don't think that how much you personally chose to play World of Warcraft affected your enjoyment of each successive expansion and the parts of those expansions, I mean that's just chemical brain tolerance 101.
---
I'm certain of it. There are tons of obscure(ish) literary references in WoW.
---
&gt; Lg34gk950f
---
That is a thing of beauty!  I had to turn my 144hz monitor back down to 60hz or the private WoW client would do weird things with my mouse IIRC.
---
Thing is, Vanilla and TBC really found that sweet spot between being casual and hardcore.  A sweet spot that was lost in WotLK, and then artificially replicated with difficulties after that.
---
I feel confident this will be buried or forgot in 3 months so here are my secret plans:
---
-I will fight with the crowd and servers on launch day.  I'll only do this 4-5 hours before I go to bed.
---
-I'll go to work the next day and let things settle.  The hope is the servers will be more stable and no-lifers doing their 24-30 hours binge will get far enough ahead and tucker out.
---
-Then I'll no-life the next 2 days.  This will get me ahead of the casual pack before the first weekend but behind the original no-lifers; right in the middle of the road.
---
-I'll coast there over that first weekend, then go back to playing semi-hardcore.
---
Both work, and the difference is minimal.
---
From a purely min/max perspective, you’d go Mage.  Minimal gear competition, better CC, and free/better water for your Paladin to keep everyone healed.  Bear tank, Healadin, and Mage is a sick start to any group.  You literally cover everything (for most dungeons) with just your core three.
---
Do you actively play WoW private servers for these three expansions, if its a concern about keeping things seperate, then these servers are already the answer to your problems.
---
Reputational damage. A person could only do that once before being flagged and blacklisted by most of the server. And if they're already making a profit by doing nothing, why throw away a good thing?
---
Wouldn't negate the testing then? Doing zones and quests 10 levels higher then they were intended for?
---
if youre worried about someone who puts in 5 times the amount of effort as you do having better gear then you, an mmo probably isnt the type of game you wanna be playing
---
this plus another to play mage for free food and drink.
---
I'm personally aiming for Skinning and Leatherworking for my off-tank feral
---
You're shilling your site too much
---
Heroics are worthless period. Nobody besides the most casual players still do them.
---
Funnily enough, this sub still complains about the group finder in retail. 🤔🤔🤔
---
Boomkin are pretty bad in PvP in vanilla, especially if you are going to compare them to elemental shaman.  With similar gear, you are going to have MUCH more success with Shaman I think.  If you are decked out in AQ40 spell gear and trinkets then you can do a lot of damage with Boomkin, but that is also true of basically every other class.  Moonfire is pretty much your only unique spell since it has 30 yard range and is instant cast.
---
No there weren’t. Threat isn’t something that shows up in a combat log, it has to be tested and recorded for every weapon effect, every spell, every class. It took months to even have a basic working version and it was being updated constantly with better math and data, sometimes multiple releases in one day.
---
We “American fatties” created the game.
---
Yesss! For nostalgia's sake, they better do this.
---
Enchanting and engineering are a great money making combo...
---
I think this is solid testing but lastnight Storm was in a group with others doing SM so. /shrug
---
Only trolls vote trolls
---
Add on would help. But it would (from my memory) show nodes you’ve already collected, it wouldn’t necessarily track them “live” on your minimap.
---
No it doesn't.  Keep looking
---
You really need to get your eyes checked, I even made it bold.
---
** conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others **
---
Rogues can still gank. BM hunters can still force people to throw their hands in the air. Paladins are still tough to take down. Warriors with a healer can plow multiple players.
---
Take your pick.
---
The title alone made me giggle
---
Weird. I have a friend named TJ from AZ who plays wow and we’ll be playing together. Thought this was his account for a sec!
---
I disagree entirely. I think classic is going to appeal to newer players 10x more than retail and other current day MMO's do.  
---
\- it's slower paced  
---
\- even with it being slower, to a newer player a level 60 max level sounds way less daunting than level 120 + 7 expansions worth of content  
---
\- a more intimate connection between you and your character / server  
---
\- a new, less saturated, economy   
---
I could go on, but I assure you, even if it doesn't seem like it on a surface level, there are plenty of reasons why Classic is more new player friendly than what we have today with retail.
---
you've probably never been software tester then. 
---
Just because something appears to work first, second, or even 100th time, sometimes your just waiting on the right magic combination for a bug to reveal itself.
---
The first macro I ever wrote (and was so proud of) was /point /laugh /spit lol.
---
What issues did you have? Im noticing some mouse issues now aswell
---
I saw other MTs going dual wield and using what dps gear they have obtained plus throw away plate dps gear. I personally didn't feel this was that great. I myself (in vanilla, this isn't priv server) just stayed in my tank gear, kept tab target rending, cleave on constant timer and shield slam on cd on highest priority. If you get a proper tank weapon (fast attack speed) and wear your best tanking gear you can aoe pull with infinite rage. You'll be eating after each pull of course. You can also efficiently grind elites in EP. Sundering the melee guys and being able to revenge almost constantly in your rotation makes them go down quicker than you'd imagine and you wont lose a 1v1 to them.
---
How does this translate into good quality testing 10 levels above what its intended for?
---
A good wand is just about all you'll need gear wise.  They are very powerful and won't eat up your Mana.  I mean of course grab gear as you go but wand is the only thing you'll really want to set out for specifically early on at least.
---
You're so dumb lol
---
I just replayed WC3 The Frozen Throne, and the very last mission is titled "A Symphony of Frost and Flame."  Needless to say, 18 years ago I did not recognize the reference, but it's obvious now!
---
if you wanna feral tank you already arent min maxing
---
Making Morgan Latimore the Night's King?
---
It's in the ToS, regardless if you're foaming at the mouth that you want to be a toxic player and can't.
---
Is there a reason they go mage or warrior to get rank 14? Are certain classes better at farming honor? How does the honor system work?
---
And what was the intended way?
---
Threat isn’t something that just shows up in combat logs like damage. Every single thing that generates or reduces threat has to be compared to a known threat generator and even then it’s just a range of informed guesses.
---
While it’s feasible we could take the old values and put them into a new addon designed with the Retail API, this would require access to the Beta and a lot of time. So far, no one has stepped up.
---
I never said it did. I was just trying to help you understand what OP was saying.
---
Not really, there will be lots of players questing at level to find if mobs hit harder than they should.  For the mechanics of the quests, it doesn't matter about level, a bug would affect regardless.  Also, after launch, there will be completionists who work on quests way above level because they won't leave a zone until they finish the quests.
---
Tauren are the sexiest, Orcs are the most badass.
---
Sick ninja edit brah
---
Yes, I remember it feeling slower, I just don't remember if feeling quite as Clunky, so I'm trying to figure out if its Retro WoW + Old Client.
---
arguably so but Layering solves this to some degree not completely. Having everyone out in the world would lend to solid testing perhaps even on layering right?
---
Context doesn't matter,   
---
**conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others**  
---
This is in the ToS that you agreed to. There is no other point to this discussion.
---
This. You cannot escape it. They are shoving it down our throats like God shoved the 10 commandments up moses' ass
---
Just like how everything is bigger in texas...
---
everything matters more in classic
---
Doesn't he coil you the first 2 seconds of the fight?
---
Wait, how much is Classic going to be per month and do we know if it’s in addition to a wow sub?
---
The stand is expensive because Apple are fucking scum. End of.
---
When I was playing vanilla way back when, it was Under City.
---
Mainly because I was playing on some shit PC and no one ever went to UC so it loaded quicker and didn't slow me down.
---
Aesthetically though, probably Booty Bay. Just because it was mixed faction and straight Pirate madness.
---
It really was a good idea. Like so many things, it got replaced with button on your interface. Might as well let us level up by pressing a button too.
---
oh no a childish comment on the internet, thank god you're here.
---
careful for swapping continents if you go the exploration xp route, caused a crash and queue wait during the stress test for me.
---
They're honestly not really that far off these days anymore.
---
* Windows laptop prices kinda caught up with (entry level) Macbooks in price, for the form factor and features. 
---
* iPhones have crept up in price but Samsung followed suit. About par (or a little above) with other flagships, but objectively better processing power on their new custom processor thing. Doesn't make a difference for most users.
---
* Mac Pro actually lines up pretty well with true pro grade equipment prices. There's a bit of Apple tax here, especially compared to a DIY build, but you're getting warranty and saving on paying your IT staff to assemble it and be responsible for debugging, etc. It's still a little more expensive than a Windows equivalent, but they did some good hardware design from the looks of it.
---
* Mac Pro monitor (whatever it's called, the $5-6000 one) is decently cheaper than many of the monitors that it's going up against. There's plenty of studios using $35,000-$40,000 monitors.
---
&gt; This exact example at hand: players of the same faction who are egregiously disrupting a widely organized activity with no intention of contributing 
---
I mean, you just proved by your own logic that this is NOT suspend-able. It is World of WARcraft.
---
Should players be banned because they raided an in-game funeral that the opposite faction was hosting? Precedent says no.
---
&gt; yeah but anyone who beats me is just a noob who has no life 
---
No life and a well-fucked mother.
---
There's a few differences between a dungeon and a raid.
---
* Dungeons are usually a couple-hour investment for progression through a difficult dungeon, raids are several weeks or months for most players, if they even get through it
---
* Dungeons are done while leveling, raids are done at level cap
---
If I skip Hellfire Ramparts at 60, I can do Heroic Ramparts at 70.  If I do Normal Steamvault, it's an hour to go through, and I don't have as much time sunk in as I would with Karahzan, which may take a new guild a few weeks or months to progress through.  (You know, when everyone is in greens, half the players don't know their class, and you're rotating 3-4 spots a week trying to build up to 10 consistent players).
---
So Heroic Steamvault or Heroic Ramparts aren't a huge shock, because we don't spend enough time in there while leveling to build an expectation for it.  But Heroic Karahzan would be something that invalidates months of hard work.
---
lmao - vicious.
---
Oh of course, I just meant whats wrong with this particular picture of it?
---
Its completely saturated buddy
---
What issues did you have? I noticed my mouse is acting up too
---
The salt on streamers on this sub is amazing lmao. Is everyone here just that old and out of touch?  Streamers are not going anywhere its way past the time for people to still be bitching about them years later
---
Just drop in some vodka and it makes the dew taste better.
---
I was thinking about this one for PvP. Orc stun resist is obviously a pretty big deal, and the damage boost is good too, also axe skill. But Taurens have another interrupt thanks to their stun, but more importantly, the range increase. Charge into a pack, sweeping strikes, whirlwind.  On orc, you might not hit as many people as a tauren would. That could be a notable difference. 
---
Loss of orc stun resist can also be mitigated by PvP trinket, free action potion, and living action potion.
---
Your Mom is an Epic Mount
---
Did you miss not having tailoring at 60 with your priest? I want to go alchemy/herbalism but I feel like I'm missing out if I dont get the BoP tailoring robe. Removing tailoring and levelling up alchemy at 60 seems like such a chore though.
---
Ok let's go with this.
---
They play more than you.
---
They have more skill than you due to playing more than you.
---
You get stomped repeatedly by that skill.
---
You come to Reddit to complain about ... What now?
---
What is the new complaint?
---
Is the sky blue?!
---
Sorry, that's just the game. You're a snowflake if you think its a problem.
---
Thanks for the utterly irrelevant and unrequested piece of data... I guess (?)
---
Now let me get this straight. 
---
Are you implying that ... because it has never happened in the past (btw classic hasn't released yet jfyi) thus, will never happen in the future? despite the fact that the guy clearly stated his intention on doing so in Classic because of how social reputation is important?
---
Agree to disagree on this one my man
---
don't forget SM
---
The first 6 slot you find is such a great feeling.  Especially when you get one from your very first kill
---
New level of “no changes” xD I love it
---
YES YES
---
I think its time to take off sort by New
---
ya true paladins were always a pain in the ass but I wouldn't be able to kill anyone fast enough before they just gave up and ran away lol
---
and I want something good for solo so warr is right out but ya goddamn warr+pally gank squads were the fucking worst back in the day
---
I don't remember BM in vanilla, what was hard about them? I know they had pets with special abilities etc available
---
It’s a breeding machine in the games
---
Lol i did yea. I edited
---
Why does everyone tout wotlk like it was something awesome. Running laps in dalaran because it wasn’t a raid night was awesome to you?
---
Im in the exact same boat as you, leaning a little more towards huntard tho.
---
Multiple difficulties was fine, people should be able to experience the content they pay for.
---
But 4 difficulties is stupid. Especially the 15 ilvl variance.
---
Quality /r/iamverysmart material here boys
---
I feel like H shattered halls was way more of a pain in the ass than H MGT ever was
---
I disagree on both points. Content is the *last* reason modern WoW is suffering. There is lots of content in BFA, and the raiding (so I’ve heard) is excellent. It’s the design of the entire game surrounding the content that makes the game bad.
---
And on the other front, Private servers have had a massive draw for a while now. And that’s even with the problems of losing your toon or server that Private servers have. All they need is fresh servers every now and then for people who want to relive the launch. 
---
How much content can they keep adding until the game is too cluttered? I’d say a handful of dungeons and 1-2 small raids. But after a year or two of adding content, there would be so much original Vanilla content that becomes obsolete, and too many raids to handle. A WoW expac has never had 5+ *meaningful* tiers of content. So in the end Vanilla WoW+ would just hit the same level of stasis when there’s no more new content to add. 
---
WoW and OSRS are very different games. It works well for runescape since it’s a sandbox. Vanilla is not, and there is a lot of thought in the progression of content, a level of thought that I don’t believe the modern team would use when designing around a pre-existing game made by different people. And even if they executed it well, it could only be for so long before the game is overcluttered and old content is overshadowed by new glitzy content.
---
also dat ass
---
I imagine them as 30-somethings stuck in a job they hate who are mad as fuck somebody like asmon makes thousands every day sitting at his computer playing a beta they weren't invited to
---
&gt; I think it could change gameplay indirectly. Certain races might become more appealing if they have more/different hair options. People for whom that matters redistribute based on the new options, and class distributions change as a result as well (since race/class are quite restricted in Classic compared to BFA).
---
Race/Class was NEVER going to be the same as it was back then anyways. There is sooo much more information readily available and not to mention things like streamer influence.
---
Why not both? I want my character turning by tilting the monitor 
---
TRUE IMMERSION
---
Okay then, if context doesn't matter, it is reasonable to ban all AH goblins who try and control markets. It is reasonable to ban players who repeatedly kill FPs. It is reasonable to ban entire guilds who contest world bosses, or control Devilsaur spawns.
---
I'm really curious to see if they keep the Taurens max range the same. Two yards ain't much but if it helps me get a hamstring off, I'll take it. Warstomp is a nice rage-free interrupt, and extra HP is never bad. 
---
But hardiness and a free AP CD is pretty OP, so you cant lose really.
---
The game experience of others is PvP on a PvP server.  That's your chosen experience, you picked.
---
I'm still deciding between rogue, warlock and hunter. But damn reading trough this I remember now how many cool things rogues had in vanilla and how much fun they were.
---
PvP happened on a pvp server.  Not griefing.
---
It's not killing them that is the problem, that's organic interaction on a PvP server. It's hunting them down for hours every day, following them in every zone they go to kill them every day, yes, some people do that, for attention I suppose.
---
+1
---
If you had a guild to carry you through Kara, Gruul, and Magtheridon for a shot at token drops, sure. That could be said for any content.
---
The monitor is great, but it's not better than Dell's similar offering which is $1100 cheaper...or $2000 cheaper if you want a monitor stand.
---
They have a 32" 8K display (62% more megapixels) with 100% color reproduction in the narrower gamuts, and 98% in P3-DCI. The only place Apple's is a clear win over Dell's, is in the HDR capability and brightness nits.
---
And neither company makes their own panels, so it's not like you're getting proprietary panel tech with either of them.
---
If you ask him to test something in his chat, he's always seems happy to test it real quick.
---
If it's a macro, or seeing if you can /follow in bgs,  seeing if a merchat sells X,  whatever.
---
&gt; A person ruining the competitiveness of a dueling tournament with a decent prize pool being viewed by 125k viewers is literally nothing like your example
---
Yes it is. Its an in-game event, where people are PVPing in a contested zone. Other players can find that event, and kill the other faction. 
---
Guess why? Because if they're in a contested zone, that's literally how the game works.
---
&gt;it ruined the viewing experience for everyone.
---
And here lies the problem. Who fucking cares? That's the streamer's issue. The game isn't meant to be a content factory or viewing experience for others. Ruining a stream is not in anyway grounds for in-game suspensions or actions. That's the steamer's fault for planning it in a way that can be interrupted. That's the reality of life television.
---
I got the opposite problem, she wants to play but is threatening to play the opposite faction!
---
&gt; I can be a keyboard-turning clicker, but if I'm in T2 gear, and you are in blues, I will very likely wreck you, no matter how skilled you are.
---
I think this part is an exaggeration. There is definitely a point that comes fairly quickly where a superior player can defeat significant gear disparity. Two fairly equally skilled players with that gear disparity would be as you said.
---
Did you actually read the post? I literally said this. Anything killing related is fine. The quote you picked out is carrying the context that i just said killing is ok. I'm talking about pure disruption by same faction with zero recourse by the affected party
---
No that shit was nasty.
---
The point of bringing it back is because a lot of people wanted to play it.  Suggestions like this just seem like some people out are more interested in a revision to history instead of bringing back Vanilla.
---
Why can't just Vanilla be enough?
---
No. Mountain Dew is gross and for people who are gross.
---
No thanks, stuff is poison.
---
What matters in this game is your ability to kill boars and then dragons.  Everything else is fleeting.  Live.  To.  Win.
---
Hi did you read what I wrote
---
Anything killing related is ok, because it's warcraft
---
This is true but dependent on players on your server. Any hardcore pvper is going to be an engineer. But like I said most of the items bars are used to craft aren’t consumables. You may see thorium and dense stone stabilize at a decent price but I don’t think there will be enough buyers to make prices rise.
---
Wow!  Thanks for the link, what an amazing trailer!
---
Funny enough, this is what got me into the game. I saw my cousin flying over the river in elwyn and I was stunned.
---
OP off this thread in your post.
---
I liked heroics in TBC tbh...  
---
But the 10 level difference to bump things to 70 is good.  
---
Level 70 deadmines? Eeeehh, bit bland.  
---
At least classics end game dungeons are still great at 60 even when raiding and the lore included is awesome regardless.
---
Selling arcanite transmutes was a free 25g every two days. Lazy man's way of farming.
---
Silverpine is aids at 12, even with the barrens being swamped it is a better choice
---
So engineering is the only prof with a specialization that doesn’t require you to drop it completely to switch in vanilla?
---
I was considering that as well, but I know that leatherworking falls off very quickly
---
&gt; mage is very nice to level all around.
---
be prepared for a ton of downtime as you drink after every pull
---
Yeah, but only one of them is a tax write off.
---
Dew isn't green, the bottles are green.
---
your first pair of shoulders, best feeling ever
---
The first thing I noticed in the beta is how damn smooth it is, the blizzard servers are much better than any pservers I've ever played on and other than lagspikes from devs testing/implementing things it's been crazy good from an input / feel perspective
---
You mean just like Vanilla? Oh wait, it's worse, since the only way to level efficiently is to auto attack and press one ability.
---
I've been a test for more games then I can count. Right now just in the MMO space I'm testing Crowfall, Ashes of Creation and Pantheon
---
What would they use for red in the packets? I'd rather they make a custom Lapsang souchong version for Horde. And maybe a sweet one with bilberries for Alliance.
---
Yes, I'm saying that it's ok to test the quests done at a higher level because that will happen when the game is live.  Really, it's just not a big deal that some people are leveling in dungeons.
---
I recovered my photobucket account as well. So many treasures on there.
---
I think the Horde one was the same flavor as the Halo one, DELICIOUS
---
What do you mean? I don’t understand at all what you’re saying.
---
But the whole point of a slow progression and soft ramp is to make the game more meaningful and to avoid completely overshooting new content, there’s no problem with creating new content that doesn’t absolutely exponentially change your stats, there’s no reason you should go from hundreds of hp to ~300k the bloat is just gross. You can make tiers of progression all better than each other but still not making it exponential. And the problem is the content, not the quantity but the quality of it. A lot of content introduced in BFA is repetitive, simple, and an artificial time spender as a whole. Class design has been more or less scrapped to streamline gameplay. WoW went from an RPG fantasy simulator, to a slot machine of rpg and repetitive grinds
---
You never Had real Access this was Just a Bug and they normaly have to remove your Stress Test. You can be lucky that you had a glimpse of Beta, but that is No reason to invite someone. That would be Like you invite someone for a Double Bug xD
---
I've covered this discussion in alot of my previous guilds' rogue chat in disc.   
---
From an efficiency point of view, combat is going to be the best spec to use. You are not waiting on stealth, you can sinister strike (for less) from any angle (don't need to be behind). Your escape cooldowns will be available more often, sprint out of roots / slows. Parry and dodge more. Disarm on successful parries (and great dmg).   
---
I personally leveled as subtlety. As much as pulling more than one mob at a time will become a pain, and front-stabbing isn't always viable depending on latency -- you will ambush and backstab most mobs and they will be dead. You clearly have an edge in PVP as you can 2 shot most classes.   
---
And to those saying you need good daggers.. They are all literally given to you if you pickpocket every mob you encounter. I've looted so many \[Vendetta\] \[Assassin's Blade\] \[The Ziggler\] \[Sliverblade\] \[Claw of the Shadowmancer\] \[Gutripper\] while leveling.  
---
It's definitly viable, but it isn't BiS for PvE.
---
In case anyone is curious about the total cost of training for the talents listed under the OP Version 2, here is a [tabulation of the expenses](https://imgur.com/QwYnAqS).
---
People mad streamers are giving exposure and introducing the game to thousands of new players which will only enrich the community.
---
this subreddit in a nutshell, hating everything without having played the content. You can enter all Dungeons in retail regardless of ilvl normaly. Only lfr has a restriction.
---
Consecration does are damage on the ground around you. Holy shield or Retribution aura does damage to things that hit you. Shield spikes do damage to things that hit you. You find a spot with things that are lower level than you, pick up a ton of aggro, and drop consecration. Heal yourself while everything dies. 
---
Any beast area will give you tons of leather to sell. Humans drop tons of greens and cloth. Instances are great because you can reset them, theres no competition for spawns, and they usually are human.
---
Example:
---
Stockades in stormwind, you can pull the whole instance at once. Vendor the trash, put greens and cloth on the AH and look out for 19-29 Twink items.
---
I can tell u that even if a lot of people *think* they are going tank, they aren't. The majority won't make it to max, and if they do, a lot of people don't enjoy the bland classic tanking style, so that leaves a very small portion like always.
---
Just play what you want to play. 
---
People who are going to play tank because it means "easy spots and free loots" will quickly find out that its not true at all.
---
People have paided me for doing it solo.
---
What would classify as that, then? Because if its an action you can physical ltake in game, then its not greifing, as you said.
---
Healing totems? If a player can heal another player's totem and they can do it in any other duel or PVP scenario, then why is it now illegal in a streamer's event? Why should this streamer, and his event, gain special privilege and protections that any other player would not get?

I'm I EU (until brexit) and tend to have latency around 100-120 to the beta servers, feels great. The only time I notice anything is when time interrupts but that could just be me being bad
---
If your definition of “better off” is finding groups faster than yes, play a tank.  If that is not your definition then idk kevin.
---
Yours looks way better than mine lol. Mine were hardly lined up
---
You could make a tank that’s not a warrior.
---
I wonder if there’s going to be any kind of keys released coinciding with Classic for like specific items in game? Obviously not Mountain Dew, but maybe something from Blizzcon or some other retailer besides this one, associated with Blizzard in someway.
---
Orc for the looks and bright green lusciousness, as it happens orc has excellent racials too.
---
Just do whatever you want.
---
I like you Gatekeepers who assume that anyone who doesn't think Vanilla is a 100% flawless masterpiece is some BfA fanboy.
---
There are real reasons I'm not playing BfA and will play Classic, but character models isn't one of them.
---
I'm saying that the desire to play the game in separated forms of each expansion can already be fulfilled by playing private servers for each of the different expansions.
---
Good to hear. I wonder how much of that is the fact that Classic is running on a newer client, so even though they are trying to be authentic with classic, there is a lot more "prediction" and latency hiding on the client.
---
Really? Lol that’s insane. But was it a guild that recruited you that just needed a good MT? Or just legit full pug
---
Really liked the content, my only issue is your ambient background noise in game is reallllllllly high and sometimes interferes/distracts from your dialogue.
---
Otherwise great job and look forward to more of your future videos (as I'll be running Hunter first)
---
And you'll need to farm an infinite number of MCPs for raiding.
---
I strongly disagree with vanilla being a better new-player friendly experience. It's a tough grind up to 60, and I expect a large percentage of people that play Classic will not make it.
---
And 1000nits sustained brightness, 1600 peak, is *insanely* impressive.
---
Thanks! I had a 19 rogue Twink back in Vanilla and that was really fun. I'm looking for max level stuff now, but rogue could still be a good fit.
---
Have you ever played later this game? You cant gank in starting zones
---
This is one thing I miss that I doubt we’ll see with classic; seeing WoW everywhere... the commercials, the mtn dew promos, the references in pop culture, people talking about it everywhere I went.
---
If you mainly PvE, Mage by level 6 youll know if you like it.
---
Do you enjoy Frostbolting? If so, you get to reap the benefits of arguably the best class. If you focus on PvE, Mage might be the most boring though. Frostbolt all day everyday. And even with wands youll be OOMing often when leveling
---
Gnomer
---
I remember my first time.  Folks were running up to these machines and I had not ONE clue what to do.
---
But to be honest, the teleport machines were the biggest scam, especially for the eggs quest in Tanaris.
---
I mean... I don't disagree with you at all. They're definitely good ways for companies to market their games.   
---
But it's not an either or situation imo. Even if 1/100 people that see a TV ad for classic decide to subscribe, that wouldn't be a loss. Moreover, a % of the other 99/100 could already be considering playing Classic, and who doesn't like a little bit of added hype?
---
And friendly actions are not okay? Healing a totem can be done by anyone, anywhere in the world, when any duel or PVP fight is happening.
---
Is it now greifing just because a streamer hosted an event? Why does a streamer gain protections other players don't have?
---
Again:
---
&gt;The game isn't meant to be a content factory or viewing experience for others. Ruining a stream is not in anyway grounds for in-game suspensions or actions. That's the steamer's fault for planning it in a way that can be interrupted. That's the reality of life television.
---
Which 5.1 bug is that?
---
Stick with your gut. Doesn't matter what people say they're going to roll, good tanks will always be in demand. At the end of the day, you log onto WoW to do what YOU want, not what you think other people want from you. Tanking is a lot of fun, but you won't know if you enjoy it more than other roles until you try it yourself.

WotLK kinda took a dump on a lot of lore though sooo
---
There are. I translated using the website in the OP.
---
The streamers sure are spamming a lot of SM right now for the XP.
---
&gt; Doesn't he coil you the first 2 seconds of the fight?
---
Yes, but as I said it was completely inconsequential.
---
wallets out BABY!
---
Long waits for what?
---
Damn it I wish my wife liked gaming
---
Would engineering for that shield be worth it?
---
Maybe in order to grow the Classic community.
---
But I'm not gonna encourage people to drink that poison, as that would actively shrink the community.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I'll make sure to adjust that moving forward. Cheers!
---
Your choices should have consequences. It’s makes choices *matter*. If your free to respect whenever, your choice of spec does not matter. Please stop trying to take meaningful player decisions out of the game

As a healer, it was always our tank.  Just as the group finally began to gel, that the dps realized that they needed defense as well as offense...
---
"Mom says I need to log off now."
---
GAWD, this is why I heal PUGS!
---
It’s not really free. The 100g’s for mount for both warlock and Paladin is split up over skills and training on the way to 40. They still put out the same amount of gold everyone else does. It’s just done over 40 levels so you don’t have to have 100g in one go at 40.
---
Blizzard is implementing features and testing them extensively to ensure that everyone will have a smooth launch experience regardless of what realm you choose.
---
&gt;You don't just say things and that makes them true.
---
&gt; WOTLK is highly revered in large part because *THEY* killed the Lich King.
---
Right, and players of the same faction can do whatever they want to each other in war. Heal totems hwen you're pvping someone? Go for it. Spam /laugh at someone in a town? Go for it.
---
Why is it greifing? Just because a streamer is putting on an event? WoW Is not a content factory for streamers, and should not have its rules decided by these specific individuals.
---
Undead warrior op
---
I think the idea is that people know how good they are now (great levelers, tons of utility in end-game, etc) so there will be lots of people that roll them. IIRC, they were one of the less popular classes around vanilla launch... not sure why, maybe because they didn't fit a typical archtype or lore?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this... I'm certainly not an authority on the subject.
---
Lol, you’re the one who sends messages to people telling them to kill them selves. I’d say of the two of us, your intelligence is the only one in question.
---
dont talk such nonsense
---
&gt;A guy going around blacklisting people for ganking him, is going to end up just getting laughed at, and making himself look bad to be honest.
---
Too late
---
Who cares lmao
---
Even if it’s a slow ramp, the ramp *has* to end. And it’s not just about the stats at the highest end. It’s about the lower end too. Even if none of the raids that come out 1.14 and beyond exceed Naxx, they do help to outsource upgrades from the other previous *actual* Vanilla content. If my raid team ever says “Hey do we want to do MC or XYZ today?” “... Hm, we need more upgrades from XYZ and we can do it faster, let’s do that instead “ ... that’ll be a huge disappointment, especially if XYZ doesn’t have the flavor of the old raids.
---
Wtf is this even a picture of
---
Thick leather will sell. Everything before that, the AH cut is too big for it to be worth it. Anyone with leatherworking farms their own skins. You might be able to sell to them direct for slightly over vendor price. That's the best you can hope for.
---
I always hated the gear grind when I played and that once you leveled past a dungeon there was no real reason to go back and do it again. Should I be checking out retail again? I keep hearing people complain that gear doesnt matter that much in retail now. That actually sounds rather appealing to me.
---
Start with the mage, so you can afford getting some gear upgrade on your warrior :)
---
Specs are not particularly balanced in vanilla.  Some are clearly worse then others.  
---
Balance is perhaps the worst dps spec in the game.  Compared to a mage for example, it lacks control, escape, burst, and utility.  It is ok at tanking, but not actually good at it.  
---
While it can heal, it cannot do it in moonkin form, and out of moonkin you need to kite.  Quickly you get to a point where being resto-balance hybrid is better.  
---
Elemental is subpar in pve, but once geared is very stong in pvp.  the 30/0/21 build is a very strong burst dps, while providing all the utility of a resto shaman, and upto 90% of the healing if needed.
---
It definitely hurts the competitiveness as it stands. In case you didn't watch it, and for anyone who happens across this thread later in life. The intial placement of the duels was in the Crossroads.  The TD (TipsOut) acknowledged the annoyance of TrollGodX and opted to move the tournament. In his defense, he picked a relatively good option (Underneath UC I believe). I am unaware how to get down there, but TrollGodX knew exactly how to get there. SodaPoppin, against his better judgement/instructions, decided to display his screen for his stream as soon as he arrived. TrollGodX either saw this stream or one of the others who did the same thing, and just moved to that area as well. I think that the attendees of this tournament did not help themselves, nor did the TD react appropriately as this problem progressed.
---
Again, I will acknowledge that TrollGods behavior was an annoyance and altered some of the duels. He also could have been avoided all together had TipsOut just sat for a moment and though out a way to correct the issue. Instead he allowed the tournament he was running to easily be undermined by a level 1 tauren who had zero flights path and zero options to deal with level 10+ mobs who would have completely ignored the lvl 30 duelers.
---
Taurens look the best, imo. And that's the most important factor.
---
Didn’t read just disagree.
---
Dope! Thx
---
What two encounters did they tank? Twin Emps and ___? Forgive my ignorance please
---
Couple grand? You shouldn't spend that much. 
---
A 200$ computer at Microcenter will get you 60 FPS on Classic Mode graphics setting. If you build your own 500$ will allow you to play at Ultra on 120+ FPS. 
---
And a Chair + Desk can be gotten at IKEA for like 200$, 300$ for a really nice desk + chair.
---
I still have a can of each :)
---
Does Poisons take up one of the two main professions slots, or is it like cooking/fishing?
---
Hey, I did mean unitframe, fixed that.
---
If you want to increase the dungeon difficulty in Classic all you need to do is invite a pug hunter.
---
The benefits was related to gold and group invites, but yes obviously the money from streaming is a benefit, but that's irl. There's plenty of downsides to streaming in IRL, but this was about in-game, where he just wants to be a treated like a normal player. Is that too much to ask?
---
MY WAR BOT NEEDS FUEL!
---
It’s like Cooking/Fishing/First Aid
---
Play a MOBA for that kind of PvP, this is not the game for you
---
The would be fine, I don't mind if time investment is translated to better skills, that's how it should be.
---
M+ was the best addition to retail WoW. Making Dungeons, you would never visit for the remainder of the expansion, relevant again. 
---
Making it possible to Challange yourself to the hardest possible Dungeon content ever created.
---
We need to get you into the beta!
---
It's a shame that it looks like this is from Private Servers and not the beta because there are some fucky Feign Death bugs going on right now that have been giving me a headache and because we're using a more modern version of the Macro system, a lot of the older scripts and macros don't work.
---
Been meaning to ask, what are your thoughts on [Raptor Strike weaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bglurw/classic_hunter_design_vs_user_experience/) as part of your rotation? I understand that it can be a bit sketchy to do in some raid encounters but I feel like it ought to be pretty safe for dungeons. Unfortunately I haven't seen too many examples but the logic and the math seems to make sense.
---
It’s doable. Just think of it as hard mode.
---
Permadeath is brutal, that sounds so fun
---
Did one item sell significantly more than the other/consistently higher ?
---
Along with changing the capitol cities from Org to TBC and then Wrath.
---
When you flew into Org after a raid, everyone checked you for gear and/or whispered.
---
Hey! This data is powered by the Wowhead Client, along with a bunch of other things like droprates and vendor items. I made a post a few weeks ago here detailing it all: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bslmrx/classic_wowhead_client_now_working_uploads_needed/
---
In rare circumstances, we may manually add coordinate data. Wowhead's parent company does own Thottbot, but it's not totally easy to port all the coordinates over (and there are discrepancies across other parts of Thottbot, like quest levels vs Classic) so we haven't relied on that info yet.
---
you think you'll tank but you wont lol
---
Havent felt that in any game since Vanilla was butchered by TBC.
---
Why is it aids?
---
I feel like it seems a little weird to simply let something die when there's so much player investment involved. The reason a lot of long time players still play BFA is because of the time they've already invested.
---
Nah focusing on tanking really sucks. Fury warrior that occasionally tanks is the dream. You get to tank all the dungeons to 60 and for prebis, you get to tank raids often, but you don't have to worry about all the downsides of being a tank.
---
All these people saying it won't be a thing in Classic, haven't even played the spec. BT got buffed in a late patch, so I think that is part of the reason why people don't remember it from Vanilla. People were tanking in MS spec bc MS was OP pre nerfs to weapon dmg.  They also clearly didn't understand how debuffs work. The experiences of Vanilla should not be indicative of how it will work in Classic, since so little time actually played on the 1.12 patch before TBC.  
---
It is still great threat increase without Enrage proccing from /sit. The threat is very valuable for most content. Perhaps parry mechanics will kill it. But I very much doubt it and expect it to be strong in classic.
---
it means easy spots... but you have to be competent
---
&gt;I think the takeaway is that "lol don't dungeon grind it's terrible exp/hr" is wrong.
---
I'm guilty of that. I've made a few posts about it, and stand corrected.
---
I'm watching and documenting asmongold and esfand doing SMGY at 33 right now.
---
I can't get full accuracy due to not knowing specific XP values, but you can get close with doing the math of "6.1 bubbles to 9.5 bubbles" during a 13 minute run
---
Their average for the past few runs has been
---
- 35,800 xph
---
- 36,300 xph
---
- 41,800 xph
---
Cdew's run last night in Library was getting similar. 12,000xp give or take in 18-20 minutes for 35-40k xph.
---
It's a fine option, it seems. Better for better group comps.
---
Well, I am a mid 30, who happens to love his job as a software developer. I don't make millions, but at a net income of 70k+ a year, before the yearly bonus, (and that's € not $), there is nothing that I wan't in my life and cannot afford.
---
What I don't understand, is how you somehow pretend to improve your ego, by being a fan of someone who has a lot of money, and has a lot of attention, while you have neither.
---
i'm going to say the j ð a a f word
---
I'm not arguing anything about the impact of streamer realms and I'm going to avoid it just because of them having advantages, its just the blacklist reaction will not happen and if it did it would be so low of a chance unlike what people are preaching on this sub.
---
I think you’re underestimating the impact them having BiS gear had on the speed of these runs. It’s not terrible xp by any means but it’s for sure not that good as it is on beta because of this.
---
This is how the world looked to me when I first started playing. The graphics seemed amazing and the world felt immersive and infinite
---
Just aim to get Edgemasters handguards to be your BiS gloves for PvE. It might be bad early raiding but you should be fine if you are competent and have edgemaster.
---
x2 As its a phone picture of a screenshot.
---
I call it being a drag on the raid lol
---
I assumed it because you assumed that Im being nitpicky and I base everything off just the models alone. And when it comes to the models,
---
 they are goofy looking bouncy ass teletubby motherfuckers compared to the old models and animations and it does bother me.
---
Still water is pre-raid BiS, Sodastream is BiS
---
Also, they’ll be stronger as a larger mana pool lessens the impact of shifting.
---
Forget the streamers, the event itself was large enough and had money on the line and is worthy of "excessive disruption" in my opinion. See my other comment that addresses the friendly actions. In short, there's no way to avoid it. When the play has no reasonable recourse, it breaks #3
---
I still have a bottle of each of these in my basement, they are misshapen but never opened.
---
I agree with you in principle, that it would be nice if more things were traditionally tested. However getting beta or alpha access to a game doesn't really make you a "software tester". 
---
This is beta, it's like having 10,000 monkeys banging on keys, they each do their own thing and then someone randomly runs into a bug, and maybe reports it.  
---
Just claiming you would do "better" doesn't really buy any "cred" here.  Just like a teenage dude trying to talk his date into something sexual, the sky is the limit in promises made, but the gift once given grants amnesia to promises made.
---
Does a frogs ass hit the ground every time it hops? You’re damn right I do!
---
That's kind of what I'm thinking tbh
---
I will not be playing on streamers realm's good assumption.
---
&gt;glad to see you totally misunderstand the concerns people have about this.
---
You haven't said anything relevant to why a streamer blacklisting someone is a bad thing. Blacklisting is just a social construct, you're still allowed to make groups and play the game.  Rather you have spent your time using ad hominems. 
---
When you disagree with someone do you really laugh at the beginning every time?
---
&gt;I only say autistic and virgin cuz that's the demographic of the average twitch viewer, especially for WoW
---
Just quoting this because it's ironic.
---
No disagreements here, I think the price is in the zone.
---
The stand is completely retarded though and very tonedeaf. I almost think the VESA mount @ $199 is even worse...to ship a $5000 monitor that isn't even complete? It can't be mounted out of the box, can't sit on a desk, it's incomplete.
---
At a minimum the VESA mount should be included, and they should be charging $149 for the Pro Stand...which would still be a pretty nice markup. Guarantee you that thing doesn't cost them more than $25 to build.
---
Good for you! But no one cares. Everyone here plays games, some like watching others play as well.  Streaming has no effect on you playing your game despite the delusions shared by some here
---
This sub instead get a few dozens of the same low effort posts every day on it.
---
I feel like there needs to be a community voice in order to show blizzard that they need to be in touch with their players, if you give it to one person, plenty of other people will feel like they're getting muted. It'd make more sense to not allow player voting, Blizzard is going to consult people like preach regardless, they already do for classic WoW.
---
Again, this is beta who cares what happens when the game goes live? Some could argue that it might in fact be deal that people aren't actually testing.
---
What is in your opinion the most fun class to level? I already have my main set as a Horde Hunter. I am also interested in leveling an Alliance alt, as I absolutely adore Elwenn, Darkshore, Duskwood, etc. I am kind of thinking Druid or Warlock, but what do you guys think? I am not at all interested in life at 60, since I probably won't get this alt to max level anyway.
---
Min/max mindset is cancer. You don’t have to have the best version of any role to have fun and make progress.
---
You're 100% correct, it *is* griefing. That said, it's griefing that you are consenting to by rolling on a PvP server. Is it good for the game? Probably not. I actively avoided WPvP with people my level because they would always get buttmad and log onto their fresh level 60 undead rogue and camp me for an hour when I killed them. I was *dissuaded* to partake in WPvP because of it. That said, people like it so it will, and should, stay in the game. 
---
Catch me on a PvE server though, because I want no part of that buffoonery.
---
Just came across this and holy hell nice job!!
---
&gt; The stand is expensive because the neck is mechanically complex to allow silky adjustment and rotation with minimal effort 
---

---
That sounds lame. Everyone should be able to get the best loot if they are skilled enough, not be prevented because some guild is hoarding the boss spawns for themselves. That's just like the Devilsaur mafia, any players like that deserve a permaban.
---
I think some things need to die gracefully. You ever watch a show that's gone on too long and you only continue watching it because you're *invested*? That's BFA to me. And regardless of any good intentions, that's what would happen to classic+.
---
I'll take a great two seasons instead of eight drawn out nonsense that makes you despise the series in general.
---
Wanding boars is awesome to you? Pvp was best in wotlk
---
Pallys lack a taunt.... bears I can deal with but as a healer having a non warrior main tank is a pain in the butt
---
Haha, resto all the way, fuck all that extra work for feral.
---
Gear matters to a point but it is really easy to get now so it is not really indicative of player skill. High M+ keys and mythic raids will demolish you in full BIS regardless if you cant do mechanics. I really like killing bosses and gear is sort of a means to an end for me so I enjoy it. The catchup mechanics are insane and the next patch will drop in a few weeks so if you wanted to check it out, now would be a good time.
---
Everyone with stress test access got beta access when they patched in lvl 40, you can go back and watch any streamer about 2 min after they get in initially after lvl 40 patch the server restarts again , this second restart was them fixing the beta being open to all with stress test access
---
There are about 5 other posts on this sub about people getting beta access for a few minutes yesterday and then servers go down and it's gone
---
At least you will have a way bigger Alliance bias in Classic.
---
Things I've found so far:
---
Alliance has 7 more mounts faction limited Mounts.
---
They have 2 more rep factions, one of them being a Quest Mount which the Horde didn't have an equivalent for until WotLK.
---
Around 100 more faction specific quests.
---
They also have 4 more faction specific territories (advantage only on PvP servers I guess but still).
---
Thanks for the info, I’ll keep it in mind
---
I can see your perspective, I personally just think that WoW can be made into an even better game than it was, and I’d like to see an attempt to pursue that after people get to relive their favorite content.
---
I mean, most of the people on the Beta have twink-level gear at level 30, so they can crush dungeons pretty handily. Yes there are quest bottlenecks but that would mostly due to everyone being let loose at the same time. When Classic goes live, it'll likely be a different story because people will be trickling through more gradually the higher the level of content. Less impact by the bottlenecks at those levels.
---
I'm torn between playing a Warrior and a Hunter (Alliance or Horde is still up in the air)  I played a warlock originally and will primarily be playing with a healer (he has yet to decide).  Will mostly be playing PvE with a little PvP on the side.  Help?!

We won't be going for server first, but a Hardcore 40 man raid team who utilizes loot council, achieves BiS Gear, enchants, maxing professions, exalting rep, scouting for world bosses and getting Scarab Lord
---
\*\*PVP:\*\* Duh
---
\*\*Hardcore PVP:\*\* People who strive for rank 14, and join the BG Team
---
There will be no rules/restrictions, but if you as a player try to go up a rung from casual to progression and so on, you'll have to meet the requirements of that layer to get there.
---
Because it's multilayered players who find themselves changed don't have to leave the guild to join a guild that is their new playstyle because we cater to all playstyles.
---
We also have a Daily/Trade-chat/Auction House system where you can make a daily for others to complete, auction something off and watch people bid/buy it out without an auction house tax, and trade-chat for Looking To Service Requests like enchanting and crafting products.

Lastly, ask me questions. If you are interested but on the fence, just PM me and I can answer anything you'd like. We currently have \*\*30 players\*\*, and play a private server for practice.

Bag slots really aren't that important while leveling once you reach a certain threshold. You're constantly hitting vendors and don't have much else to keep on your person. The exception to this is hunters, but they get the quickest leveling speed, so fuck 'em.
---
Once you have 24 Linen Cloth and ding 10, pay 10c to grab tailoring at the first major town, /yell "Free bags! Your mats, just 6 Linen Cloth!" Accept the the first 66 Linen you get. Make the bolts until your skill is 45, learn Linen Bag, make the 15 bags, give 11 of them away. Then drop Tailoring and pick up whatever two professions you want.
---
That'll get you to 40 slots, which is plenty. Alliance get an extra 10 slots from doing quests in Duskwood, Wetlands, and Westfall.
---
Once you hit 50 and start seeing Runecloth, you just need 120 and 8 Rugged Leather to bring you up to 72 slots.
---
Bag space only gets annoying at max level when you start collecting a Mounted Set, Resist Sets, Tank/Healing Sets, various Trinkets, various profession items, etc.
---
Damn it. I didn't want this to be the fastest way to level.
---
I guess I'll have to enjoy the questing experience on alts.
---
It is wrong, because when you try to do it, you don't get the luxury of upwards 200h played to max out your level 30 character. If you think you will find a lot of lvl 30s with BiS gear and full enchantments, you are in for a disappointment.
---
&gt;The other thing is that it's quite likely the fastest levellers at release will use a honed dungeon grinding strategy.
---
Over the last 14 years, a lot of people who are far more experienced at this game than you will evel be, have worked out the optimal way to level a character in Vanilla World of Warcraft. Not a single one of them agrees with you.
---
&gt; Is there excessive disruption to the experience of other players?
---
One could argue that the event is disruptive to the experience of players. By that same logic, is hosting an event now greifing? What if a streamer has a group helping him with a class quest, tagging mobs constantly and preventing other players from doing that quest.
---
&gt; Is the disruption caused by mechanisms outside of the intended gameplay?
---
Right, and healing totems, or using your abilities on friendlies or enemies, is NOT that. I would be curious to hear examples of what might be mechanics outside of the game. Perhaps hosting a stream and organizing a large group of players to control an area, wouldn't that be "mechanisms outside of intended gameplay?"
---
&gt;With reasonable effort, is the affected party not able to avoid it?
---
Well this litmus test simply fails, because corpse camping can't be avoided (beyond logging off) but that isn't considered greifing.
---
And again, wouldn't a streamer hosting an event and controlling an area that is needed for quest fall under "not able to avoid it?"
---
The point I'm making is that streamers, and their own ways of playing the game, does not and should not deserve its own form of greifing rules, or rulesets in general.
---
&gt;If it's streaming to 100k people, yes the disruption is excessive.
---
See, your basis for the argument is that the viewers of the stream matter to the game. But they don't. They aren't playing the game, they are watching someone else. 
---
In fact, creating rules to cater to "100k viewers" is against YOUR OWN LOGIC.
---
&gt; Like rolling the largest character model in the game and following people around with the sole intention of blocking their view and access to objects in the game world
---
Uh, but this is inside the mechanisms of intended play. We don't have collision detection, cameras are third person, can be adjusted and moved. What you talked about inst even physically possible. 
---
Lets say it is, if collision is a game mechanic, then using it in the game isn't greifing.
---
Worse.  Imagine Ragnaros spawning once per week in a non-instanced zone.  The guild who engages and kills Rag first gets all the loot the week.  Everyone else gets nothing.  It's to the point where you have to pay 100,000 Currency (plat/gold) for loot rights to a rare item that doesn't always drop.  But that was the nature of Everquest and rarity.
---
they dont consult them they ask them after the beta is out.
---
im talking about when developing ideas.
---
i think preach would be the perfect person but there would be several others that would be good choices.
---
It’s called character progression. And yeah your core rotation is not very complex, but you have a unique toolkit and situational abilities in every class contrary to current wow. So yeah another thing about retail wow. They removed every unique aspects of the different classes.
---
Thats kind of what I figured. I see how it would be nice to be "done" and have what I need but then it becomes dead/trivial content. Not sure which I prefer yet.
---
You say in the end it will be over, but the game ended 12 years ago and here we are still clamoring for it.  The problem is that there is no world where I can currently play old school vanilla wow.  In the years to come, I will never be able to play vanilla with my son, grandson, or while I'll laying the hospital waiting to die of old age.  Adding a pure Vanilla server is the only way to ever relive that game.  I'm open to discussion about resetting the server from time to time to relive the launch experience, but taking the game beyond just vanilla isn't what I was asking for when I signed the petition.
---
And no, I don't consider private servers as a real alternative to an official classic server.
---
&gt; Streaming has no effect on you playing your game despite the delusions shared by some here
---
Please point out to me where I said it did.
---
I’d heal for any of them. I actually prefer a bear or pally. Makes for a more fun experience.
---
You should use the weekly LFG recruitment thread linked in the sidebar.
---
We get it, you don't like Blizzard and that's fine but stretches like this make you look really stupid
---
Here are the numbers.
---
In August 2010, 3 months before Cataclysm was released...
---
488 guilds (0.68% of all guilds) killed 25 man Heroic Lich King.
---
2098 guilds (2.94 of all guilds) killed 10 man Heroic Lich King.
---
Over 30000 guilds (40% of all guilds) killed 10 man Normal Lich King.
---
Just under 10000 guilds (13.6% of all guilds) killed 25 man Normal Lich King.
---
No. I am a REAL Vanilla Gamer and will only drink the ones I have left from back in the day.
---
Point really well made. I agree 100%. They should've done a better job picking the spot and not broadcasting it until necessary. If this was retail I would not support any action against the account, though personally I do feel like a GM merely teleporting him out was a reasonable response in the moment. Glad we came to a good spot on this. Thanks for the back and forth.
---

---
You might be right but two things make me think. 
---
* By far the best damage class in these runs is mage - and they get very little damage benefit from 'twinking'. The mages hitting 700-800dps on group pulls will still be hitting those numbers from the minute they hit 30. The tanking/healing requirements similarly will be drastically reduced through a good strategy and kiting.
---
* You know a really good way way to get awesome gear? Grinding dungeons. After a few runs your group will effectively be twinks anyway - all the way to level 60. They will get every drop from the dungeons and far more BoE greens than most people get.
---
I don’t disagree, I just think that if it’s on a too limited scope, it’ll cause more problems than anything else.
---
It's an extremely tough decision to make as a paladin though. You are sworn to destroy the undead but also holden to protect the innocent. Uther thought that as long as they were living, they could be saved some other way. But Arthas wanted to cull them, which is a brilliant strategic idea because it eliminates an enemy threat preemptively. But Arthas brashly strips Uther of his rank immediately when Uther disagrees, when they could have come to a compromise. Arthas should have been pleading but instead he was demanding, so ultimately it was **Arthas' own personality trait that pushed his friends away and not because Uther didn't help.** Basically Arthas was always a dick and sucked as a paladin, he should have rolled a warrior.
---
It can be so brutal if you don’t find one before you leave the the level 1-4 section of your starting zone, after that you have a lot of quest items to pick up and long runs to vendors. That first 6 slot makes a difference.
---
Some People enjoy doing harder content. M+ / Mythics
---
Of course that was an exxageration. Moreso, because of the rock-paper-scissors way how classes in Vanilla interact with each other in PvP
---
It's way to early for this.
---
&gt; I think you’re underestimating the impact them having BiS gear had on the speed of these runs.
---
But if you level grind through dungeons, you may start off slow mid-20s, but once you hit 30 and do SMGY 30 times, you'll gear out there, then 30 runs through Library will gear you out there, then armory 30 times will gear you up for Cath, etc.
---
These guys are in BIS cause they ran dungeons, and if they're running dungeons to level, they're just staying in perpetual BiS
---
Yes, this new "game fuel" that is supposed to be an energy drink is really not the same.
---
In the long term I'm a fan of Classic --&gt; TBC --&gt; New Content but one of the issues with retail is also the fact that they kind of ran out of ideas.
---
I think that's really great advice, so many people say they are going to roll tank and speed level, but I think I'm just going to get back into enjoying the game like I did 15 years ago!
---
should've made the blood elf an undead
---
Yeah overall the quests are pretty bad but doing the chain to get the Crystals near the frost giants allows you to farm ekkos. Ekkos can be turned in for very powerful buffs that many raiding guilds require you to bring.
---
I also don't think we should alienate the r/classicwowplus people. But I do think that it's trying to piggyback off the r/classicwow community.   
---
Your opinions are entirely valid and should be heard, but this is not the place for it. I used to work on a highly customized pserver version of WoW, and the vision of the team was strong and focused initially but became some washed out crappy game by the time it released, too many hands in the pie.  
---
So you might understand my worries over this foreign immigration into r/classicwow \- I support you and what you want, but until we find out what Blizzard decides for post-classic, you are the enemy of this subreddit so long as you try to push an agenda through the community achievement and phenomenon that classic wow is.
---
ye i thought it was that expulsom machine at first
---
And you're not alone. These kinda posts are made multiple times a day. So who knows? Maybe you'll get what you're looking for. Only time will tell. 
---
As for me, I'm not going to hold my breath. I'll still be content with a transition into a classic TBC before I call it quits -- just like I did a decade ago.
---
Well, if the intended way is less obvious than the not intended way then there is also something wrong when it comes to game design, don't you think?
---
The warlock quest to get the mount needs you to buy some expensive stuff, don't know the details since I have never played as a lock, but that is why it's not a 1100g save.
---
However I did play mage back in the days and they are hands down the best farmers thx to their aoe farming abilities!
---
While this is true, one thing I've seen people do on private servers is turn off whispers and say "Recruiting for X! /poke me at Ironforge bridge!".
---
This is shittier than group inv imo.
---
Thats what i'm doing in the Beta =D
---
Did someone say Thunder... Nevermind.
---
Realm count is nothing but assumptions. 
---
 Currently, there are 27 streamers who have over 500 viewers (playing world of warcraft on twitch including BFA streams.) 
---
It's a safe assumption that there will be overlap between streaming groups playing on the same realm so they can play together. Let's say each streamer has 2 other streamer friends.  27 streamers = 9 groups of 3. Now add the faction split. That would make around 4-5 "streamer" servers.
---
Again, we can't have definite answers with absolutes. There will be realms for the average gamer. 
---
In Vanilla WoW they released more servers due to server population issues; if its the case you can move server. Another assumption here but this is based on events that have happened before.
---
Im glad this didn't devolve. I honestly didn't know about the GMs response until I listened to the podcast. I think it was the best solution, but I do feel odd that he apparently transports the level 1 to winterspring? xD
---
Please. Don't remind me.
---
I think it was more just that I enjoy the role of tanking rather than free loot or spots.  There's just something about sword and board warrior that is engaging!
---
I wouldn't call it bland, just simple
---
There's also waifu2x-caffe if you want a GUI: https://github.com/lltcggie/waifu2x-caffe
---
You'll have plenty of friends as a priest.  Especially as a dwarf one with fear ward.
---
Eh they will for sure not be twinks as BiS will for sure not come from a couple dungeons.  Some dungeons literally offer nothing for most classes. And I’m not arguing that you can’t cheese dungeons by stacking frost mages and ape pulling, but in a normal scenario this isn’t going to happen and you know that...
---
They will when anyone knows what the servers are going to be called.
---
You swap between them constantly and its fine
---
Why would anyone argue that dungeon grinding is inefficient? You get 28% more experience per mob in a group of 5 than you do solo.
---
The only problem is you can't do it all the way to 60. There just aren't enough dungeons to make sure the mobs are yellow at every level and many of them don't have enough kills per hour to compete with questing and grinding.
---
Bonjour, je vais vérifier votre chaîne youtube et votre chaîne twitch.
---
See with imp backstab and remorsless which you can get both earlier on, gives you roughly a 75% chance to crit with backstab after evey kill. Backstab crits typically take 40% or more of an enemies health, I usually just gouge, wait for energy to tick back, back stab and evisc, most enemies are dead. And since he was In a gouge half the fight you don't have to eat nearly as much if at all. I do agree though it can be a bitch till 30 then it gets ez mode as hell.
---
I am not decked out in level 30 twink gear, it is indeed an accurate representation.
---
Hey I'd try it, not that my guild would be silly enough to use a pally tank lol
---
If you are whipping out the TOS over being ganked you best role on a PVE. Not only are other players laughing at you but the GM you cry to is as well.
---
Yeah it wasnt wow related, i know, it was related to commercials of the time
---
This is an ENGLISH subreddit.
---
Also, put your self-promotion somewhere else, thank you.
---
I'm saying that seperating the expansions and the community isn't something I believe classic wow should be used for. In an attempt to please niche desires private servers exist to fill specific needs that aren't met by one answer.
---
Well i didnt say it was good for the company, simply said id love to see it
---
&gt; King who controls the dead and rides an undead dragon and comes from the wintry lands in the north
---
It's funny too, it's like the show stole a bit of Arthas for the Night King as well. So the game references the books (WC3 and WoW), and then the show based off the books references the game.
---
Apple is a disgrace I don't know why anyone supports them, completely blind sheep.
---
Warlock ez
---
Lol. I wonder if the GM put his hearthstone cooldown to 59min...
---
Well, you can always get the gloves that are +7 weapon skill to swords, axes, and daggers
---
You made money?  The house would suffer major losses over the long run at these odds 
---
100g Bet: for the house
---
.65*100 =65g
---
.2*-200= -40g
---
.1*-300= -30g
---
.05*-400 = -20g
---
On average the house would lose 25g for every 100g bet 
---
Just FYI :p
---
A lot of the bis doesn’t even come from dungeons, and I’m not arguing that dungeon grinding won’t be the most efficient ever... of course you can with the perfect group.  I’m saying for the most part, for the average player, this isn’t going to happen.
---
I don't think the translator works. If I type in "kek" from either faction "lol" doesn't come out on the other end.
---
I did quite a bit of bug reporting in the stress-test but obviously that is pretty limited without feign death/traps.
---
As far as raptor strike weaving, I have done it before and it is ALWAYS a dps increase as long as you can use it between autoshots, and while your multi-shot/aimed shot cds are lagging.
---
There are certain encounters where positional requirements make it completely unviable and dangerous, but again, if you can use it you always should in the right circumstances. Just another level of mastery and comfortability with the fight.
---
Jaina hating the Horde makes sense considering all she went through.
---
I wouldn’t join a guild with that mindset. Anyone can find preapproved specs and classes. The fun comes from using what you have and making it work.
---
Considering Tremor totem is a thing, many bosses don’t have fear mechanics, and comparing it to Berserking or Blood Fury, there’s really no way to argue for Undead Rogues from a PvE perspective outside of liking their looks.
---
Where does it say you can’t post in other languages?
---
I was just attempting to make a discussion on the future not push an agenda. I have no power with classic WoW, but I can share opinions, and hear the opinions of others.
---
Field Marshal's Raiment (epic pvp set) dont have spirit e gives 12 mana regen per 5s  
---
Are these 3 Meditation points really worth it?  
---
Shadow Weaving 5 (for faster procs) + Shadow Focus 5 (for pve) looks way better.  
---
With or without Meditation/Spirit Tap, outside leveling, u are mana-hungry and have to drink.  
---
What difference does?
---
The bag was always worth a decent amount like 100-200g. The head not so much since it drops every week and only physical and tank cares about it so most people have it, but sometimes it could go high.
---
I know there's other people that even did bids on the onyxia weapons. People would join because there's a lot of rich rogues that wants a big pvp sword, I heard it going for 1.9k once.
---
Back then the game wasn't 14 years old with outdated graphics. Updated models would actually do more to bring back an old nostalgic feel.
---
well it depends on if you are a progression minded guild or not
---
Everyone is dumb and forgets this shit didn’t come out til WotLk. It was like 2009. Get this away from my vanilla.
---
Likely mining, to help with the engineering leveling, I would think.  Thanks!
---
you're forgetting the most important L t a a f
---
Bear main tank on some fights can be considered optimal due to TPS bring so high from Manual Crowd Pummeler 
---
Bear as main would be rare for sure, but it's more than viable. Plus HotW druid tanks can heal on fights they aren't need and decurse better than any other spec/class so I wouldn't call them a drag on the raid. 
---
Pallies on the other hand....
---
Casual alt on alliance, for that a paladin is great! And exclusive to alliance so you would never experience it on horde side. Plus going to duskwood, a dark place, as a holy warrior is the best way to experience the zone imo
---
If you've been listening at all over the past 3 weeks, everyone is saying dungeons are way easier on Classic than they have been on private servers. Whether by intention or accident, PSers made it an unviable strategy.    
---
It wasn't a thing in vanilla because speed levelling was a 1% fringe community that liked staying up for long periods. Come Classic you will have entire poop-socking guilds racing against each other and theory crafting for levelling quickly.
---
Pservs don't entirely agree with Vanilla, and Classic doesn't entirely agree with Pservs.
---
I think it's disingenuous to rule out dungeon leveling at this point. If not the best method, it will at least be a good contender with knowledgeable participants, plus you get to scour the blue loot table for stuff - SM is already on the mind, and a lot of loot from there is good for a long time.
---
100%
---
No company, even ones with record profits are making enough.
---
So, it people who are getting "disconnected" and are STILL getting "disconnected" are just the ones who happened to log in (and fail) during that time period?
---
I'm not sure how this relates to the different log-in errors that people are still getting. People with stress-test access are getting two different log in errors still.
---
Nothing is consistent and seems "fixed." Could you elaborate on exactly what this means as it pertains to the specific log-in errors and inconsistency we see?
---
It is, but I'll never forget meeting the first guy with Thundefury back in the actual vanilla.
---
It was a hunter...
---
&gt; You get 28% more experience per mob in a group of 5 than you do solo.
---
28% **more** xp?
---
No you get 28% of the mob xp. If a mob is worth 100xp, you get 28 in a group of 5, not 128.
---
I agree - but there is for a dps increasing application for will of the forsaken. Just may be redundant.
---
To me, a hunter is the only race I would pick as a tauren that orcs get to pick from as well.  The reason being is that hunters can do some tricky stuff when they get surprised by warriors, druids and rogues.  For Shamans and warriors I think the stun resist is too much of a benefit to skip out on.  For hunters you have a plethora of defensive and movement abilities to remove yourself from danger and ensnare others.  The warstomp stun can also be used as a starting point to FD trap combo more consistently and under less pressure.  The only con is the con of all tauren, you will be too big for some doors and buildings.
---
Can you tell me why a vanilla private server would be such a far cry from your original vanilla experience? I've played vanilla servers and relived a community experience with the old game content. I'm curious why you don't consider it a valid alternative.
---
This sounds interesting. :) Some information about who I am, what I am looking for, and a few comments:
---
**Who I am:**
---
* old probably even by your guild's standards
---
* played casually through vanilla (only exception: ranking on a warrior - rose steadily to Lt-Commander the week before the system was abandoned), and raided through T4 (main tank), T5 (off-tank and healer), as well as T7 and T8 (mostly healing, a bit of tanking); I also raided MC, Ony, BWL, and ZG as a mage on some private servers until I couldn't take people like "IGankLowbies" (name self-explanatory) anymore
---
* European in the process of becoming a citizen
---
* LA based
---
* every character will be a gnome, class permitting; if not, a dwarf
---
* will play an alt (tank) with my wife more casually
---
* lots of time and flexibility on my hands for some good, and more bad reasons 
---
**What I am looking for (and what not);**
---
* PVE server that has no streamer - or, this turning out to be impossible, one of the less "cool" ones only
---
* mature and friendly crowd (not too stuck-up :))
---
* I tend to have two mains, and plan, for classic, on a mage and either a warlock or a (holy) priest. As a priest, I'd probably prefer raid healing (as opposed to MT healing) - but this is all still in flux, and flexible based on guild needs. I love tanking (my favorite role), but would rather not compete for the one (true) spot in a raid there is
---
* a guild that's serious about raiding, but not serious enough to expect:
---
1. flasking (it makes raiding and farming for raiding the be-all, end-all). Bringing the other usual raid consumables and getting buffs is understood
---
2. a raid-logging guild
---
3. min-maxing. Examples of what I don't like: insisting on how to allocate 51/51 talent points for a spec (I'll usually have that even, but if someone has 49/51 ideal, it shouldn't matter); strict rules on what to wear (say, it should be fine to wear T2 armor over the butt-ugly bloodvine set - not even sure what I'd do, but an attitude of "so what?" preferred); insisting on human-only rogues for the racial
---
**Other:**
---
* I don't play retail (I stopped when the cataclysm came as I didn't want to play in a world in which the old Loch Modan didn't exist anymore). Any idea how you expect to split your time between retail and classic?
---
* what roles to you most need so far?
---
* what is btag? Googling it has some interesting results (e.g., the 'urban dictionary' one), but nothing that seems to make sense
---
&gt; Forget the streamers, the event itself was large enough and had money on the line and is worthy of "excessive disruption" in my opinion
---
Again, that's their own fault for organizing, and advertising it, in a way that made it possible to be interrupted.
---
Blizzard didn't hold the event. blizzard didn't organize the prize pool or money, and blizzard isn't invovled with how the event is carried out.
---
Therefore, Blizzard should not take actions against individuals that choose to interact with other individuals, using gameplay mechanics.
---
That's like saying I hosted a blackjack tournament at my local park, and got mad that some guy stood over my shoulder and gave me false advice.
---
its not simple a good tank and a bad tank, are miles from eachother. There is still skillcap
---
Questing has never been the fastest way to level pre-Cata. It's simply been the least tedious. Even back in the day before optimized group grinding strategies, finding a cozy spot to grind and just grinding the shit out of it has always been a better strategy. Most quests are simply a vehicle to get you to grind and are hardly worth the effort involved running back and forth, except that you *might* get some green gear (and as other posters noted - if you grind dungeons, you will be geared up in blue gear which is a pretty damn big deal).
---
You can do all of the content with any of the tanks. You have to play differently is all. It’s only easier with warrior.
---
For every tank that rushes to 60, you need 4, 9, and 39 other players to also rush to 60, otherwise you'll just be twiddling your thumbs.
---
I dunno, once i got into the habit of controlling my pet I just did it all the time. Practice like you perform I suppose.
---
Lol, ever poor it into a glass? It’s light green bro
---
Better compared to what though? and why?   
---
I didn't deny it's a tough grind to 60, because it is, and you're absolutely right, a percentage will quit. Happens with any game that involves a time commitment.   
---
But as backwards thinking as it may seem, I truly don't think the time commitment is the deciding factor for whether a newer player stays or unsubs. It's what you gain in return for that time that will either keep people in or force them out. It's undeniable that Classic gives you a deeper sense of accomplishment then a game like BFA that hands you gear, abilities, mounts, gold, and reputation at every chance imaginable.   
---
another few examples why Classic is more new player friendly  
---
\- Less stuff to focus on. Compared to Retail where you've 4 raid difficulties, countless dungeon difficulties, battleground, arenas, rated battleground, rated arenas, achievement hunting, mount collecting, pet collecting, pet battling, etc.   
---
\- In Classic what do you have? 4 things basically.   
---
Leveling. PVE. PVP. and Gold farming. That's about it.   
---
\- There are plenty of games that make you feel like a God. BFA is one of these games. From start to level cap you can count on 1 hand the amount of dangerous encounters you've had, and many games follow this philosophy too. So imo Classic will be just as a refreshing change for newer players as it is for vets that love the game.
---
Classic-Vanilla WoW shouldn't be seperated, I agree. Which in my mind, means not converting it into Classic and Classic +. Classic, TBC, and Wrath, however, is the smarter, more obvious, more cost-effective method. People who would rather be playing TBC or Wrath probably wont be playing much Vanilla after 3 years anyways. If they do, it will be in minor amounts.
---
&gt; I had hoped that they would have a machine with some degree of choice/ability to modify. But I think that Apple are not into that market.
---
They are, and other than a bad patch in the last few years, they always have been.
---
Everybody's talking about the stand, but they announced it alongside a machine with 8 PCIe slots, 12 DIMM slots, a 1.4kW power supply, and a case that opens with one hand and zero tools.
---
Get these low quality posts outta here. If you can't do research on your own, you shouldn't base your choice on some poll.
---
Just like WoW, steam sales are not the same anymore, they are shit now, no more flash sales, no more voting .
---
Would love to see a strawpoll for what faction people are rolling as a sticky post, I would potentially pick my faction to help balance if one side is too populated.
---
I would try the new xpacs after cata and find them usually lacking, I'm happy I got to experience Throne of Thunder as CC based on dumb luck.
---
Those work for DPS but not tanking as they are mail, and threat matters.  Moreover, you’ll still be missing the last point needed to get to the “magic” 308.  Finally, what’s your trade off here?  It’s not like Stoneform or Shadowmeld has some super compelling trade off.
---
So you have 5 teams? Gonna be a lot of work to run, and for that reason, I'm out.
---
... that’s like saying classic private servers were the answer to the problems.... how hypocritical. Some people WANT to play official retail bc and wotlk again. Just keep it separate.
---
Classic --&gt; TBC ---&gt; Project Titan
---
Before you get access again? What makes you so sure you’re getting in?
---
Same here lol, except in FF14. He was having fun and I was getting fishes, win for everyone!
---
And, like, before everyone knew the strategy of most boss fights or could easily find them.  World firsts in Classic demonstrate one thing; a lack of life.
---
A group of 5 can kill 5 mobs in the time it takes a solo player to kill one, if the solo player can even kill the mob themselves in the first place.
---
I call BS on the pally
---
there are fights where you need a taunt
---
Only if you can afford Apple stand compatible iRope for just $499
---
I disagree, TBC felt like more polished version of vanilla if anything.
---
And you bet grinding was just as hard, hell maybe even harder than in vanilla.
---
Yep bcuz that’s all there is to do in classic was wand boars. U right
---
Gathering bags are totally worth again.
---
agree, bears can be solid 
---
and are great for some fights
---
Would the same go for pvp gear? I remember working hard for the BiS reward gear during Cata. Seemed like it was hard to be competitive in PvP before I got it.
---
BfA’s beta
---
you can work around that, we just left tanks (with huge health) to take more marks if taunt resist
---
I'm not saying that its the only solution, I'm only stating that if you want to experience a separated experience, where there's multiple servers to serve niche needs, when does the official server blur the line of a private server.
---
He aoed with Sam for a few levels too prob 50/50
---
Pretty sure you will still have to double press. I don’t have a Druid high enough yet.
---
&gt; for most of Vanilla they were not.
---
That's not a good argument, unless you're willing to acknowledge that all the changes made in 1.12 are not representative of Classic gameplay. 
---
For example, Rogues. Their big revamp happened in 1.12. They changed so much that they refunded our talent points and gave us a discount on our spell training. Druids, Warriors, Paladins, Mages, and Warlocks also had spell and talent changes (mainly because they changed how Haste and Slow were calculated in 1.12.)
---
Chain Heal became a smart heal, Ranged Elemental weapons were overhauled, and Threat reduction was redesigned from the ground up. This patch also added Diminishing Returns.
---
All of that existed in the game for only *three months* before TBC pre-patch.
---
Idk how you read my comment and reply with that as I just said both sides have peenlegends, but sure man whatever you say.
---
You're surely not one of these 
---
&gt;shit lords.
---
you speak of
---
Yeah it's not like 90% of people will give up on questing and just go 5 man grinding. The point of this post really is I'm predicting hardcore guilds will be abusing dungeons to powerlevel, and it's likely world first 60 will be from a aoe speed dungeon-ing group.
---
Pro tip. smelt it first, it vendors almost 20% higher smelted
---
999 upside down is 666. WoW is the devil confirmed.
---
Oh look someone self promoting to get views on a video of other people’s content.
---
More is better when a raid roster is 40 people, up to 55 in dedicated guilds for emergencies and strats. With no server sharding the world is dead on live servers, because each server is incredibly lowly populated. The problem I have is finding a way to balance populations.
---
Questions about the legality of them, they were based off of memory, old 3rd party databases, and values seen in videos instead of the actual game code, drama about who is in charge and what they give to their friends, how the server is monetized, etc..  But ultimately, this isn't the place to discuss my own personal feelings about private servers or private servers at all.
---
I mean... it's a reaction to something the guy literally said. Not an inference, not a supposition. He plainly and bluntly stated that he could basically banish someone from ever participating in another raid if he wanted to. That, my man, is toxic behaviour. You might argue that the ones 'stream sniping' him are the toxic ones, but ultimatelly it will be in the streamer's hands to determine what's considered worth of this "penalty"... in other words they will be the judge, jury and executioner.
---
About half way through its life span, Everquest added updated character models with far more than the original 3 polygon golems that the players were used to (EQ basically had 6 character models. Small races (halflings and gnomes), large races (Ogres and trolls), and medium races (elves and humans). They basically had a male and female version of each and the race was a skin with a few protrusions added.
---
When the Luclin expansion came out, they added cat people that required new models. They revamped the rest of the races too but ran into a two pronged issue. One, old timers didn't want the new appearances because it wasn't what they were used to and two, most players were playing on a PC with the processing power of a modern day desktop calculator so the new models tanked performance.
---
So, they added an optional toggle for the new models, everyone got to see what they wanted/what their system could handle and no one's experience was damaged.
---
I would be fine with this in classic. The thing that I look forward to the most is the community, class dynamics, and gameplay mechanics that didn't make me feel railroaded. New character models would be fine with me.
---
I'm not saying to go play a private server, I'm only stating that its a legitimate answer to the idea of wanting to experience niche desires like reliving separate expansions in the same way they were previously. I feel like if they just give the game back in a 1:1 sense then there really isn't a point for them to remake it. If they're going to put the time in why not make it as polished as possible or even revamp past mistakes.
---
Lots of good info in here (if accurate) for trying to understand PvP as a lock.  I’ve been between Priest and Lock myself and wanna test these PvP specs out but have no way of doing so unless I guess an instant 60 pserver with free gear and gold for respec?  
---
Appreciate your write ups.
---
Nice! That way the ones of us who avoided diabetes or high blood pressure the first time around have a chance to catch up!
---
In the old days, we just stopped questing at 38, and grind 2 whole levels on whatever camp was mostly empty from other players than we could kill almost as fast as the respawn timer, that had anything we could sell. Vendor, AH, didn't matter.
---
Didn't matter if we leveled solo, duo, triplet, or quad, never had a character that didn't have the money for mount by 40.
---
Off tanks pick them up until the pally can take back aggro. Or make sure you use dps with threat drops like feign death or fade.
---
the leveling process is like 200 hours of fun.
---
They could!  We will have to see.
---
&gt;  and 98% in P3-DCI.
---
If you're doing color work, 98% basically rounds to 0%. You either cover the entire colorspace or you don't.
---
Before action replays and what not it was great, it’s been pretty much useless ever since
---
I get where you're coming from, and I'm not asking for **changes** here, but you have to admit that is sucks way more for certain classes. You can PvP well enough as any healer or DPS -- even in a PvE spec. But if you want to PvP on your Warrior and you have to tank later that night, its not worth spending 100g to go Prot&gt;Arms&gt;Prot just to do a couple WSGs. I usually have a PvP alt that I just switch to -- which is sad because my main is usually r3-r4 for the entire expac.
---
i meant AH but good call
---
Heineken************
---
Loot everything. Bags get full run back. More time but it’s worth it. Only time I delete stuff I have is a dungeon run where I fill up on shit.
---
My son (about 8ish) would play FPS' with my friends and myself.   They would get soo bent out of shape when he would snipe them but not shoot me.
---
If you don't find one by level 6 or so you should just vendor everything you can, skip training abilities if needed and buy one form a vendor. It'll cost you more time and money in the long run not having any space.
---
Too bad the other 36 are married and can’t play anymore. 
---
Or dead. 
---
RIP Fuzzball, he died doing what he loved. Leading a raid.
---
Don’t try to explain it. For some reason average users think that apple is marketing this product to them. Most people who read your comment have no idea that’s there’s an entire industry who are very excited by that monitor because of what it does, the quality of the product, and the (actually low for what it’s competing with) price point. I myself had the same gut reaction that most had before I read a few articles and educated myself.
---
Happaned in retail making the AH completely unusable.
---
Yea don't be excited for anything. Idiot
---
BUR
---
It's so adorable when people act like any era of this game was remotely hardcore lol.
---
For anyone who isn't a raging asshole, the real issue has nothing to do with  story content not being exclusive enough. 
---
I think the devaluing of gear is by far the bigger problem. I don't mind LFR... it's like a story mode for people who don't raid. But for the love of fuck they should not even have the slightest potential to get good gear from it. If I could make one change to retail right now it would be getting rid of warforging and RNG sockets. 
---
The other aspect of this has been the simplification of stats. Even as recently as WoD they had kind of cool shit like multistrike and mastery that did some interesting stuff, now it's mostly bland. Wouldn't be surprised if item level is the only stat some day lol. 
---
Also don't like flex raiding for normal and heroic. It's lazy and prevents small guilds from ever experiencing properly tuned content. If exclusivity is your thing you still have it in spades, actually.
---
The goal is not to create 10k servers, it's to make sure that the servers are healthy popped at 2-3k in the later parts of the game when all the tourists have left.
---
Just dont watch...
---
&gt; Does not a good argument make.
---
The alternative is not a good argument either, unless you're willing to acknowledge that *all* changes made in 1.12 are not truly representative of Vanilla gameplay.
---
1.12 existed for only three months before TBC pre-patch. Therefore it's the *least* representative of Vanilla gameplay by your logic, no?
---
I can agree with that.
---
warlock summons the fel hunter and then /afk
---
Or I could use a big boy tank
---
It's just got fun, get the stick out of your ass bud
---
Ret is not worthless like the meme opinion is but I don't think it's going to make up for not really having the consistent damage tools or cc of more versatile classes
---
I mean sad state of things is these guys are going to have very few viewers when Classic actually launches.  Everyone will have seen everything in the Beta.
---
I have a hard time seeing locks/palas are paying 100 gold more than the other classes in spells only during the 1-40 span.
---
I just wanted to know your personal take on the matter, I feel like its unrealistic to expect Activison to leave it at vanilla, in the end they want to make money and hopefully I can just hope for a good product out of the drive to earn.
---
Or, because it's *Night* Watch not *Night's* Watch, more likely Discword.
---
I don't think people actually dislike someone who streams, they dislike the groupies who exist in blinded idolatry.  I imagine a group of shrieking girls fawning over some boyband member.  I don't want to hear what they have to say and I don't care what streamer fans have to say.  Handing out money to someone because they will read your message, the following and praise for them, is nothing short of cave dwelling group think.
---
Especially because a chunk of people who quit in vanilla/TBC missed the boat on being addicted to Twitch/streamer stuff.  A fun commercial like OP mentioned would appeal to these more old school players.
---
Nah shut up
---
FGF FGF l t a f f - if you say this in orcish the ally will see it as "ZUG ZUG n i g g a"
---
On the opinion of the game, yeah... And the minority voice is overwhelmingly positive. On bug reporting, no. Most players can't have a dedicated 5man group to grind SM... So they were stuck questing in 1k needles or Arathi
---
I think that's just Waifu2x with the denoising filter turned up to 11.
---
If you don't want to get ganked go to a PvE server. Easy.
---
A.K.A. Easy mode.
---
I‘m not sure whether warrior or shaman would be better for me.
---
I would like to play a melee DPS most of the time, but I have no problem with tanking. Healing is not really my Cup of tea though.
---
I‘ll level mostly alone, but time to 60 is not of much concern to me, I just want to have a smooth experience at 60, where I‘ll also probably play alone a lot, especially for farming and PvP. I‘m unsure if warriors or Enhancement shamans would be better for that.
---
they all are pretty bad at farming gold.  I know some people would say holy nova farming in DM is a spot, but the gold per hour isn't great compared to good farming classes.  priest and shaman are about equal I would say.  priest would be the most wanted, followed with paladin, followed with shaman.
---
They already talked about new realms and xfers for overcrowding.
---
If your article doesn't mention that, bad on them. If they did and you glossed over it, bad on you.
---
If you're duo leveling with a healer you may as well go Warrior. You'll have 0 down time since they can drink as needed while before pulls.
---
I think thats Sylvannas
---
Actually banned now on retail. At least was at one point. Too many people losing and whining apparently.
---
Because thats exactly what theyre doing with Classic? It's not a literal 1:1, but in many ways, it's as faithful of a rendition of Old Vanilla as possible. Thats the whole reason we have this to begin with, not about learning from mistakes or polishing it beyond what it was.
---
lmao I forgot about Project Titan
---
Maybe if they added the frame with Spider-man sitting at the desk more people would make the connection...
---
"Let's Avoid ICC"  
---
Yeah that's not how it comes off. It feels more like a foreign invasion of a subcommunity that wants to change and mutate what the classic community pushed for. Like a perverting of the intentions behind the 280.000 signatures.
---
No, patch notes on beta launcher say 1
---
13.xxxxx but when you click it it takes y a u to the bfa patch notes.
---
wahwahwah, mommy they're mean to me in the video game!
---
They don't hate George Carlin, who is objectively funny. They hate dumb fuck comments like "hurr durr upvoted for le reference."
---
Two weeks. Don't care.
---
They are all made out of polygons FYI. But the old ones express the characters better, the new ones look lifeless and plastic.
---
I recall dungeon grinding for SM only from 30s to 40.  It was much faster than questing in Vanilla.  However, past that dungeon grinding wasn't as fast from what I recall.  Possibly because of the travel time and how close the zones are and the span of levels for the zones.  The beta is showing nothing outside of what happened in Vanilla.
---
Shadow is best for leveling, with the wand spec from disc ofc.
---
I hope so. 3k is a decent amount, perhaps a little high but still playable. Having 4-5k would already be too many.
---
Such a good description for BM hunters lol.
---
But what was the strangest enchant request ever?
---
I know that’s what’s currently happening, but do you think it would make people happy to have a repetition of history all the way to the current content?
---
no u
---
Yeah they already said water.
---
I love the Ladimore Storyline, its nice.
---
You raise an excellent question. I was thinking some kind of herbal/fruity tea, but since I tend toward black teas and an occasional green I wasn’t sure. But now I may have to experiment and do my own brand of researching prior to Classic release.
---
It isn't simple. It's very boring, but you have to be 100% on it or you'll wipe everyone.
---
The rumors are wrong and are from two different groups of people. The people who were really, really bad at the game (IE most of us back then) or the private server people who don't realize that "Blizzlike" isn't 100% and most of them had the content scaled different on purpose even. It's going to be a very easy game and most of us know and accept this, the difficulty isn't why we want it back.
---
I heard Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked an atom so hard he inspired the creation of the large hadron collider. It has never reached the same power.
---
Barrens tusk quest a FFA drop (in a group obviously), raptor hides in WC, raptor heads, etc. Only one item drops and the first to loot the mob gets it in a group, simple as that. 
---
Why are you bringing up getting invited to drop quests? How does this support your argument? Quest drops are FFA.
---
It comes down to: how do you view Classic? An RPG or an Arcade game?
---
If the first, which I personally believe is the true spirit of the game design of WoW, then the only acceptable option is a new raid with an increased difficulty and different lore, characters, monsters, etc. A clone of higher difficulty completely breaks immersion and makes completion of content abiguously illegitimate
---
Lol. I still have a classic account, I reactivate it every few years. Only time you'll see a lvl 12 night elf with corporal title anymore.
---
Common sense mode 
---
Have each class do what it's best at
---
A pally can tank... sorta, but they can heal like mad
---
I wasnt talking about imp overpower. I was talking about putting an extra point into impale instead of having 3/5 crit%.
---
I don't see how effectively splitting the playerbase in two is a good thing. As a Prot Warrior main, I just gave up the idea of PvPing on my Warrior. Having to spend ~200-300g a week to be prot for raid nights and arms for PvE just wasn't worth it. So I rolled a Mage that I could easily use to farm, PvP, and PvE as one spec and that became my BG character.
---
You and me both!  Though because I rolled Hunter as my main originally through TBC I think I'm going to do an Undead Lock and Gnome Rogue. Because, you know, I have no life...
---
This is mostly because warrior. For most classes gear is irrelevant while leveling and you can kill +2 mobs without a problem.
---
no one cares
---
All the races and genders look better with the old models. I think only Goblins look a bit better, but that's because in Vanilla they weren't meant to be a playable race, therefore they weren't given enough details.  
---
I kinda wish Vanilla had Goblins as a neutral faction or like the pandas - they can pick a side.
---
Is it still worth is to AH herbs on a fresh server? I haven’t had any experience with this and most responses I get are to vendor them early because the market starts off so low and saturated. There’s always a need for herbs so I would assume yes? But once again I don’t know enough about the fresh start economies.
---
I could never understand your point of view. It's a game. If I spend more time at a game I get better at that game.  If I have spent more time and I am  not better than you then something is wrong. And yes, your point of view is why WoW has become garbage in the past few expansions. Just because you pay for the game should never entitle you to be good at the game.  Want to be a good guitarist? That takes time. Want to own a business? That takes time too. Everything in life takes time. If you only wish to play a few hours then your rewards will be fewer. 
---
And lolskill argument. The game has been theory crafted into oblivion.  And if you don't like how Classic is setup stick to garbage BFA.  Classic doesn't cater to crying children.
---
My warbot has not had fuel in YEARS!!
---
Even if that’s true 4/5 group members twinked out is more than enough
---
Why would you solo queue when you can play in a team? 
---
It was so much fun queueing with the same people in a friendly environment and playing against the horde on our server and even knowing the enemy. I remember sometimes chilling out and fishing in AB with a friend from the horde side just for fun. 
---
So sad they will have cross realm increasing toxicity a thousand fold and removing the community aspect from BGs.
---
Why is the classic subreddit full of pissants. Dude it's a simple thread that someone posted. Just ignore it you freak
---
It's a pain for Horde, too.
---
World of Roguecraft was during patch 1.4, whereas Classic will be 1.12.
---
Rogues won't be quite the huge powerhouses they were in the video; not because Rogues were directly nerfed, but because other classes got buffs.
---
The record 1-60 run atm is through questing so..
---
Yep. I was very shocked about a $1000 monitor stand till I googled it. 
---
Then I remembered businesses spend money like crazy and $1000 is nothing when they’re saving so much on the base cost of the monitor....
---
I prefer letting people play what they want and try unique specs and making it work. Way more fun than telling everyone they have to be a warrior.
---
Try playing a Prot Warrior and having to spend 100g to go from Prot &gt; Arms &gt; Prot every raid day just so that you can Pvp but still tank for your guild. Lemme tell ya, it suuuucks.
---
Even if you wrap the old textures on the new models, the polygons will make them still look weird from certain angles. And I don't mean because old textures and new models won't work well together, but rather that the new models with their new textures still look weird at certain angles. It's something with the models themselves that no texture can fix or cover up.
---
I noticed in your guide you mentioned gnomish engineering for pve, but didn’t mention explicitly if goblin engineering is better for pvp. Is goblin better for pvp? You mentioned the goblin rocket helm so I’m assuming it is. 
---
Great guide, really enjoyed how thorough it was too. I’m now leaning towards rogue instead of warrior
---
Classic all the wayyyyyy
---
Fun fact: I do. I have SL on live.
---
/fart
---
which is also my favourite emote
---
I will also point out if you are leveling 100% by dungeons. You might not have "twink" gear but, you will have good gear.
---
Once you out level SM you can go ZF which should be very good as well. Tons of mobs over a very big instance that you can mount in and have tons of room to kite in. Probably will be down time after 48 as ST and Ulda both sound terrible for AoE grinding, but once you get to 55 I'd imagine BRD would be very good all the way to 60.
---
Mimiron/Firefighter is still one of my favorite fights. The design on it was soooo good.
---
In 2006, the Alliance on Alexstrasza stopped queueing for battlegrounds because of our faction's dominance. I was part of a well known PvP guild at the time, named &lt;Onyx&gt;. Our premades had a spectacular record and we were churning out high ranked players pretty rapidly. The growing problem we had was the ever-increasing amount of time it was taking for queues to pop. Sure, people got to know us, and we got to know them (if anyone was around for the cross-faction naked campfires in mid WSG, holler) but the Alliance really suffered from a lack of faith in their ability to stand up to us in PvP and this in turn meant fewer games per night for us.
---
I'm not sure which I preferred back then. Easy honor, or more frequent games.
---
Sticky post just for the server you're rolling on? Come on. Faction balance is on server basis, not entire region or game.
---
3k players will definitely be enough for raiding. I've played on private servers with less pop than that, and it's been fine. Raiding also isn't the only concern; hell, it's not even a major concern. Raiding is only a small part of the game. It's not modern WoW, where raiding is 99% of the game.
---
Again you're clueless about MMOs. Go play an old D&amp;D game.  Try playing a hour a day while everyone else continues playing.  You're going to be left behind.  MMOs are time sinks.  Were in the past and to an extent still are today. Classic is a time sink. Don't like that? Tough. Move on to BfA.
---
I don't think I've stated even once that I could do better. Overall I feel like that majority of the streamers have done a decent job at reporting actual bugs from what I've seen. Its the other ones that crawl all over me are the people that are in beta now, never played WoW or Vanilla and report things like "quest tracking and objectives not listed on the map are not bugs", "starting gear not having any stat values is not a bug".
---
Again that's why there are casual guilds and progression guilds, nothing wrong with either
---
I say that because I used to play alliance from Wrath to Legion because of friends that made me play alliance and when WoD launched I was the only one online of my group of friends. When Legion and BfA launched they played for a week or two and stopped. If your friend likes old mmorpgs and is hyped you'll probably be fine. I'm trying to get the gf and one of my closer friends to play classic but I'd be setting myself up for failure if I expected them to take it as seriously as I will.
---
WC1 and WC2 also looked cartoony... as much as 2D graphics with sprites could allow it. WC3 is just a continuation of that. You don't get what I meant. The game is cartoony and that is nice, but the style of "cartoony" in WC3 and Vanilla WoW is one thing, but it's lost after Cataclysm.
---
Before level 40, the only points you should put into Discipline are for Wand Specialization. Once you hit 40, you respec, get Shadowform, and then put the remaining points into Discipline as you earn them, starting with Wand Specialization again.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they are already testing phase 1 level 60 content in a secret closed beta.
---
ICC struck a good balance though. But LFD sucked in hindsight. Completely changed the dungeon experience.
---
Gotta argue with the idea most dungeons offer nothing. This simply isn't true. BY pure dungeon grinding you may not get BIS for your class but, you'll still be grilled out nicely.
---
M A R K E T I N G
---
I was enjoying a thread earlier that quickly ballooned to 50+ posts and many more upvotes.  It was a fun topic with good discussion.
---
It got removed because "low effort meme" - meanwhile, this post is fine.
---
I don't get it.  Mods here are capricious, and capricious is bad.
---
Gnomish is better for PVE because you get access to Gnomish Battle Chicken (it’s bind on pickup and can only be made by Gnomish Engineers).
---
Goblin is only recommended for PVP because Goblin Sapper Chargers are usually sold for a large amount on the Auction House, because they can only be made by Goblin Engineers, but they are not bind on pickup, neither is the Goblin Rocket Helm.
---
Thanks so much for being on Roger, people are getting back to me saying they enjoyed your priest segment :)
---
I’d call the easy moders the casuals, the players taking the road less traveled are making real progress.
---
This guy gets it.  
---
I like the old models for exactly the same reasons. I just couldn't put my thoughts and feelings into words and here you did that for me.
---
I know this is meant to be demeaning, but actually......yes to some extent? I don’t “hate” my job, and I’m not 30 yet, but it’s hard not to sometimes feel a kind of jealousy of rich neets who game “full-time” and of the rare people who were able to turn that lifestyle into a career as streamers. 
---
Real talk my dude, when it comes to people having unhealthy relationships with mmorpg gaming, theres better targets to chirp at than the working class.
---
Till a mage poly's the pet.
---
So I think I'm going paladin despite what people say about the leveling experience -- the class fantasy, gear, and overall aesthetic is too awesome, and I love hybrids. 
---
I would love it if a paladin could weigh in on how doable my plan is - level as Ret, and at max level respec into a prot/holy hybrid for tanking dungeons, solo farming, and healing if need be. Then with good pre raid gear, I'd want to switch to a ret/holy hybrid, so that I could heal raids and PvP as a DPS, just switching out some gear. Something like 21 points in holy. 
---
How doable is this plan, especially the idea of PvP dpsing ret and healing raids in one spec?
---
Sylvanas was a blood elf (ok sure high elf whatever) before she died so...
---
I honestly dont know much about pvp gear. Probably best to ask that on the wow forum. From a PvE perspective, you still have to get gear to be competitive, it just doesnt take as long as it used to.
---
Ill give it some thought, seems like the best solution when I wanna do both - Thanks!

It’s unbelievable how upset the general public has gotten over this product that apple 100% did not market toward them. It’s like getting angry at Kanye West for charging way too much for a T-shirt. Obviously, I’m not the type of person that’s gonna spend a couple hundred on a Kanye designed shirt so why waste my effort on being angry about how he priced it. Just gonna but my plain white tees and stay in my lane.
---
Yeah that makes loads of sense. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to explain all this! Really appreciated as it’s given me a massive insight into stuff I wasn’t really aware of. Cheers mate
---
Had a macro for /spit  to use while flying over ppl
---
You are right. I still think it should stay as is. I play rogue so I know the pain of re speccing often for pvp and raids.
---
Nothing says they won't. 
---
I also wonder if they'll advertise beyond retail. Probably not worth the money.
---
I didn't play vanilla originally but am fairly certain resto shaman would be your choice here.  Being a healer will be a big boon towards getting a raid group and if you friend tanks (5 man content at least) you'll have an incredibly easy time getting dungeon runs as you level/fresh 60.  I wouldn't think gear would be any worse than any other class.
---
Outdated to you, yeah. To me the vanilla graphics are timeless. Look at other games that came out in 2004 and see how they hold up. 
---
No, that’s the opposite of what updated models would do. Do you know what nostalgia means?
---
It does make things absurd. Yes. I've already experienced it. After a few weeks the problematic parts of high population taper off, and the benefits start to get greater.
---
5k+ would be great. I don't expect most people to get 60, even less will raid past MC/Ony. Even on Pservers you get population booms of 10-15k during events and hype, but really, they tend to be 4-7k until the next big server launches and the population moves on.
---
lmao wow my career is over
---
Ill pray to the RNG gods then :D
---
You say that mages do the most damage and sure thats true, they still have more int from twinking which means less downtime and they are able to do much bigger pulls cause the manapool. Int also provides spellcrit which literally translates to more damage.
---
Lets not forget the iron grenades everyone is spamming lol. They do ALOT and took ages to farm.
---
mhm and classic isnt our type of posion?
---
Yeahx well **they** made arms bad in PvE and Prot bad in Pvp. I dont know what you want me to do besides roll two Warriors lol. Its either that or just dont PvP or dont raid?
---
Charging for tank runs if you’re well geared enough to command it and people are desperate or under geared/leveled.
---
I usually just heal with priest while my friend tanks leveling dungeons in a fresh server. I thought dungeon leveling was never as terrible as most people made it sound like but I always thought that getting 30-40 out of the way in monastery and rfd was great way to gear before respecing to shadow. I can still afford a mount at 40 when I don't have to spend a peny in AH and while I however have plenty to sell
---
One of the things I will miss the most in classic is my retail locks green fire.
---
No. Shadow is fastest, holy is slower for solo stuff but a viable alternative. disc offers practically nothing for levelling outside of wand spec.
---
Yeehaw
---
TBH being the US president is like running through STV constantly, someone's gonna want to bring you down
---
How about holy/prot hybrid with reckbomb?
---
I played a druid in vanilla with a proper pvp guild. Absolutely loved it but feral/resto spec with nature's swiftness was the only real viable spec imo.
---
Only got to rank 10 though because I had a life but two other druids got to rank 13 in our guild. As a druid you don't need the weapon, just the gear sets.
---
I just destroy the things that are worth less, especially if I'm almost done with my quest arc. I'd rather delete 15c worth of grays than spend 20 minutes to get to a vendor and back.
---
Part of me thinks if we are getting layering anyway - might as well implement dynamic spawns to coincide with it. 
---
The biggest issue for me isn’t the kill quests. It’s the looting a quest item that has a 5 minute respawn timer, like bingles’ fucking tools and you have literally 200 people standing there. 
---
Getting that early rep is huge for buying bags early.
---
Oh so I can go gnomish for PvE and still have access to the good goblin items? That sounds like a win/win. My guess is that a dedicated min maxer (not me) would cap gnomish for the items and then restart as goblin.
---
I mean yeah it sucks but it's supposed to. I went thru similiar struggles going between frost and pom/pyro. I mean I raided pretty casually so it was never mandatory I respec. If I wanted to pvp a week or two I would just pass on raids
---
Exactly
---
Just no. That's apples and oranges.
---
A $999 bike costs almost nothing to develop. The $999 bikes use last gen parts, so there is little R&amp;D. The R&amp;D happens on the $5000-$10000 bikes. There is no engineering once you get to the low end bikes, its all previous gen tech.
---
$100 vs $1000 monitor stands.   $1000 vs $10000 bicycles.  Almost like there are different markets for different classes of buyers
---
As far as I can tell, in beta it scales with AP coming from stat and AP consumables/enchants.
---
It’s actually against the terms of service to communicate to other factions I thought? It didn’t stop me but I was banned.
---
Yes I would love this. They wuz gewd
---
Now you're just being silly
---
I don't give a shit, I don't drink that shit anyway.
---
sm cath &lt;3
---
Supposed to be 2 trolls 2 undead 😅
---
Disc is a decent leveling spec, you won't kill things as fast as shadow, solo.  
---
Questing in a group as disc, would make your squad pretty strong.
---
Do you recommend going mining skinning until 40 or 60 for the cash and then swapping to engineering or just leveling it as you level?
---
The original world/server first level 60’s did nothing and were nothing, they all disappeared and burned out.
---
Nothing silly about slinging hawt loads of truth.
---
Please stick to English, otherwise this subreddit will become an utter mess of posts in all kinds of different languages.
---
&gt;I don't think I've stated even once that I could do better.
---
My bad, I inferred that you were implying you could,  since you qualified your "credentials" and critiqued the testing that was done.
---
So, I guess we aren't "arguing" about anything then.  Everyone wishes they could see more things tested, and no one is saying they could do better. 
---
Cool.
---
This would never be a problem at 60 since you can just go to a high level area.  
---
If someone wants to grief on their main and the be hated on the server by everyone and never getting into a dungeon or raid or a guild, go for it.  
---
Community should handle everything and there should be minimal blizzard policing.  
---
The only reasonable time when Blizz should interfere is when someone is cheating.
---
This is where you focus on specific strategies.
---
1. Make bank/AH alts and anytime you're near a mailbox, send them what you don't immediately need
---
2. Make friends with a tailor (or become one) and send them cloth to make you bags
---
3. Incorporate a quest strategy that includes considering things like collection quests, and mobs that drop a LOT of gray items that immediately fill up your bags but you're so poor you don't even want to delete those items. If you kill a lot of one type of mob, generally junk will stack. If you are killing 2-3 different types of mobs, you'll have many more small stacks of items.
---
Alone? Melee DPS? Your answer is Rogue.
---
10k is too much, but 5k is very nice. 2.5k is going to feel dead.
---
Simple doesn't mean easy, it just means it's not as convoluted as it is in Retail
---
I think all of the events and the layout of that dungeon make it either suboptimal after quests have been completed, or on par with just questing.  Past a certain point just do what's fun, and questing will always be more efficient as you don't have to deal with the human element as much.  If you have four dedicated friends, the dungeon grinding will probably be just a tiny bit better than questing, but I don't think those people will hit 60 that much faster.  I'd have to see the numbers though.  Just how I recall it being with alts.
---
I will never underatand why people get upset that other people get gear too.
---
It seems like a pve thing only,I cant remember a pvper ever getting upset about honor/arena hear(im sure there are a few but it is much less common)
---
&gt; "We cant raid this week. All of our tanks are currently PvP specced. Sorry guys."
---
Why is it *supposed* to suck?
---
(Not looking for changes here, I'm excited either way, just curious about peoples' thought process.)
---
I have 1 on my hunter 1 on my paladin and 1 on my warrior, I got pretty lucky a few years ago and got both bindings in 3 total runs between my paladin and warrior. My hunter took me months of farming after getting the first binding to complete it.
---
tha biggest scam right now is mob dmg in classic  
---
so u can aoe cleave elites like its bfa  
---
exposing shills 2019 🗡☠️🇨🇭   
---
twitch.tv/tsixgaming
---
I’m still so fucking torn between Paladin and Warrior. I’m having fun leveling a warrior right now on a different server but just knowing that at 60 I’ll be forced to tank or dual wield fury compete with a bunch of fury dps for gear. And while the combat is fun I don’t really like having zero utility.  But boy the big dick dps is rewarding as fuck.
---
Whereas Paladin I ALSO find very fun to level but I’m not that big into healing, I tried it in retail and can’t stand staring at raid frames for 4 hours. But the more I think about it the more I’d be able to both PvP and PvE as a Ret/Holy hybrid and maybe save a few DKP while raiding for a tier set. So I’m currently thinking about sucking it up for two nights a week to heal then having a blast in WPvP being a bubble hearthing meme boi dickhead. 
---
Anyone else that has experience with both want to weigh in?
---
I level only with Skinning. At 60, I farm Devilsaur Leather for all the money. Literally, all of it. Then I level Engineering from the gold made. After I’ve saved up a few thousand gold, I’ll drop skinning for Blacksmithing and be Engineering/Blacksmithing. The reason I take Blacksmithing is for the Glimmering Mithril Insignia. I play an Orc Rogue and it’s an unbelievably powerful trinket
---
God bless you, my son. Everyone shits on me forbhsting LFD.
---
I-O ;)
---
Also thank you for sharing that link, I had not seen it before and I would consider it a must-read for even veteran hunter players. 
---
/u/serangel's commentary on dual-wielding and the 3-yard dead range (not 8) is very insightful and understanding why he is highlighting these mechanics can really shape the way you think about playing a hunter.
---
There is a reason barberous blade is in my youtube logo, and has a special place in my heart as a recent 60 hunter.
---
Did they ever sell this in the UK?
---
You're talking nonsense, the world first guilds are not talking pally tanks, it's the guilds that are OK with slower progress that do that, they are just a little bit less serious, nothing wrong with that
---
This right here is why I wonder why they’re bothering making us level in retail. Pressing “LFG” makes you better gear than anything you could make or earn in the open world. Why should I bother leveling any professions when I could do two dungeons in an hour and get blues and purples when blacksmithing only gives greens.
---
Yeah, but it looks pretty good though.
---
&gt;As far as I can tell, in beta it scales with AP coming from stats and AP consumables/enchants.
---
Not only that, but the Heroic dungeons were actually *hard*. Trying to solo-heal Shattered Halls early in the expansion was an achievement.
---
Where's MSN Messenger?
---
They've already confirmed Tauren hitboxes are working as intended.
---
also those glorious armor packs!!
---
Very little gear impacts raw output of a mage, sure, but a mage having 4k Mana instead of 1500 is a huge difference.
---
Or join a RP server with a massive horde alliance imbalance... We had a 30/70 horde alliance ratio so we only had like 2 proper premade groups doing bgs ever.
---
We had a list of people who would get High Warlord and we all managed our honour earned to make sure we stuck to the agreed progression order Haha. I got to rank 10 but then expansion was coming out before my turn to hit the higher ranks!
---
Yeah fel looks sick, even more with nemesis set :)
---
&gt; Are these 3 Meditation points really worth it?   
---
In an ideal world Mental Agility would be superior, but that isn't an option. You could transfer points elsewhere but to what? It is true that you lose benefits in that set (which admittedly you won't have for a while), but you'll still have base spirit which is still a reasonable amount of Mp5 via Meditation.    
---
Spirit Tap is also weak in that gear.   
---
&gt; Shadow Weaving 5 (for faster procs) + Shadow Focus 5 (for pve) looks way better.   
---
I typically ran with 5/5 Shadow Focus because I spent more time in PvE. As for 5/5 Shadow Weaving, it was just painful that the additional points in the talent had diminishing returns once 5 stacks were up.    
---
But if you're looking at PvE talents we need to consider Shadow Affinity. While Shadow Priests weren't topping DPS meters in PvE, they did generate up to 1.5x the threat of other DPS via healing w/VE. It could be a legitimate problem without Affinity, particularly for secondary mobs.      
---
&gt;  With or without Meditation/Spirit Tap, outside leveling, u are mana-hungry and have to drink.    
---
You can be. Typically you'd get through a raid fight just fine, but that's fully raid-buffed and using more efficient spells. In PvP you're using things like PW:S, Mind Blast spam ('pensive!), Fear, and dotting multiple enemies.   
---
I found PvP to be more taxing mana wise than PvE. That's why, when you have room for it, Mental Agility is so powerful.
---
That's my point, I want to see people in the world. From both factions. Raiding is a pretty big deal though, the most casual player can pop into a molten core or bwl. Classic was the most casual friendly game.
---
It forces a cost-benefit analysis on how you want to play. If pvp is that important ur either going to shell out the money or roll a new character. Its *supposed* to suck tho because it's a money sink. Helps curb inflation.
---
Agreed. The difficulties are fun in their own way, but it's simply a cop-out for extra content. "oh, you're done with the dungeons? DO THEM AGAIN! &amp; AGAIN!
---
bur

But I’m saying that I WANT to lol. I want a sweet setup

More like bright lime.

Sorry but I think you are delusional ;)

Is she single?
---
Lol world first easy....
---
b r o
---
Yes!  There were inklings of this in Vanilla.  Particularly, the Dire Maul tribute run, Hakkar, and the three bug boss encounter in AQ40.  The DM tribute challenged you to avoid early bosses and skip content for a special loot chest at the end.  Hakkar could be challenged without downing other bosses and he would have extra abilities, but I don't recall you being rewarded for it.  And the AQ40 bugs could be beaten in easy, medium, or hard order for different loot options.  I really wish they'd continued on with this kind of creative, immersive scaling rather than choosing your difficulty from a menu.
---
It's pretty simple. On the first day how long do you plan on playing without stopping. If you plan to play 48 hours nonstop, you check that box.
---
Record 1-60 for what? A private server?
---
Leeroy running in and everyone dying would be a great commercial. The WoW Classic logo would just pop up with the release date under it. It could at least be a YouTube ad.
---
Ooo OP! Hell yea sounds good to me
---
Pretty sure its that he got his handcrafted staff enchanted with 30+ spell power and the dude in the guild is talking about it.
---
It's a work day so probably from 6pm - 11/12pm
---
That's the original model for Sylvanas. I chose the original four Horde leaders.
---
Very easy compared to the crew that does it with a bear or pally.
---
Yeah, I saw the blue post... But I've also seen some of the beta footage and it looks super broken sometimes. 
---
Having a 'racial' that effectively allows a Warrior to catch a ranged class from (what appears to be) significantly further away seems OP.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they tweaked it in silence before release.
---
I plan to play "til the light dies in my eyes."
---
I don't think I'll ever be ready to be honest lol XD
---
I was playing a NE rogue when I rolled in 2004, in the long run I loved it playing NE I found good uses for shadowmeld as a rogue. But after playing for a while and asking around I learned that it was not the optimal class for a rogue.
---
So now I am debating between Dwarf/Gnome or roll Horde, truth to be told I still want to roll NE XD even if it's a bad choice... lol
---
If you are planning to play at launch, there will not be any "small" servers, and it will not be easy to do anything yourself. It will be wall to wall people for sure.
---
Irn Bru has a comparable amount of caffeine, IIRC.
---
Not even a reak choice for me since I decided not to buy any Apple products. Ever. Don't like their ridiculous behaviour when dealing with media and critical questions.

I do like open source systems. Linux. Unix.

Berserker Rage, Death Wish and Recklessness all make you immune to fears. (Recklessness is a 30 min CD tho.) If they're undead... I mean you're probably not going to keep them feared ever. 
---
Your best bet is just going to be making them use those abilities and do what you can to survive until they're out of those cooldowns.
---
If you're keeping track of their stances and they're not in zerker stance they can't berserker rage. Just something to note and keep in mind.
---
The most beautiful mountain ranges and scenery. That you can never actually get to.
---
yeah but then there is 3 clother. Second mage is no bad eather.

Except they are not competing with the world's best, guys that throw their entire lives into the game.
---
Your comment will fall on deaf ears everywhere on reddit and the internet. This week is the annual apple hunt.
---
Hunter ?
---
The point of WPvP is to actually fight, not sit around as a spirit waiting for another chance. How does that contribute to the excitement? Being able to afford repair bills doesn’t take away from the WPvP experience lmfao
---
Heh first time playing wow I leveled a paladin...try that.
---
Mat's costs end up being around 700-800 if my memory serves
---
Old blizz is here.
---
there seem to be no thought behind your (actually there is none)
---
Did not know I was required to show you my work... I based my statement off the most simple explanation of supply and demand. 
---
1. Maybe but that =\= a large amount of people picking it up...
---
2. Low lvl herbs, and is this just based on pure speculation too????????!????? Who did you show your work to?
---
3. People will still try to gouge the market because again supply and demand. We know the demand will be high, that’s obviously based on the outcomes, we have no appreciable proof that supply will be high. 
---
4. People plan ahead and AR is going to be the money maker, I think that’s the point
---
Since when is 3 months a few weeks.
---
Stupid posts like this should be deleted. Nobody fucking cares.
---
From everything I've read and watched.. "shadow is the leveling spec".
---
However the guides, it's always goes something like this.. put 5 points into wand spec. (disc).
---
Smite , SWP, then wand,  Repeat until level 40, then respec shadow, and spec wand again.
---
So really, the leveling spec is wand, just front load your mana (heal, shield, Damage, Dot) as needed then wand to death.
---
However I haven't leveled priest since WotLK, so I'm not an expert.
---
Damn, an edit of this with some actual effort put in.
---
I’m not sure if this is sarcasm or not so I’m just gonna wait and see if it gets roasted or if it plays out like sarcasm does.
---
Lol no it does not. Level 18 with level 18 gear takes about an hour and a half if no one is doing retarded trolly shit on private servers which have already been shown to be significantly more difficult than the beta version of the dungeon. 
---
There’s no way it’s taking that long.
---
If you like it go play minecraft.
---
there is a vendor that sells it at the darkmmon faire but its just not the same
---
Sure, if they ever do Wrath servers.
---
Maximum community freedom is the best route. Let people be assholes or nice depending on their own preference. Community policing is enough. Camping for hours has always been a ban offense but blocking totems and disrupting duels for hours has never been, and never should be. You can go do something else if someone is disrupting your duel tournament. I dont care how many people are watching the tournament or enjoying it. 
---
Camping a corpse for hours is making it so you literally cant play and thats why its ban worthy but body griefing duels does NOT take away your ability to play. It just takes away your ability to play the way you WANT. No one should ever be punished for this. Some of my favorite classic stories to watch are from people being dicks in classic.
---
Streamers get special privileges because people send them gold and help them out with information, so they should have to deal with additional griefing too. If they really want to have an uninterrupted tourney they can prerecord it in a hidden location and upload it later. Blizzard should treat them just like any other player in game.
---
You are for threat.  Damage taken often is not the limiting factor.
---
I guess... haha. I think I'm just gonna play a frost mage and farm, PvP, and PvE as one spec. I'm gonna be a one man inflation machine.
---
That’s Sylvanas
---
Something in the classic Naxx raid I think.  Not 100%, only heard of it.  My guild only start to clear trash in naxx, we never actually got the bosses.
---
This information has not been released yet
---
am just curious, what does a 30k dollar monitor look like?
---
I forgot about that... lol
---
I guess I am curious which faction is going to be more popular and by how much
---
Already been thinking of it actually...
---
He's talking about heroic dungeons in BfA, which do have an item level requirement.
---
Hunter would be my choice. Evenly splits up loot priority, and gives you a full suite of options.
---
Meaning that if you die you can't respawn ? lol XD What is this madness... I hope they wont create a guild and stay under the radar... it's like a target for ganking... I see myself just running in the other faction city just to gank someone.
---
But will a $50 monitor stand have an Apple logo on it?  
---
Checkmate, PC users.
---
I had a pyramid of the cans of these next to my computer.
---
This is incredibly wrong.  Quest drops are not FFA. Some quests have shared drops - where each party members can loot a copy of the quest item. But in group loot - only one person has rights to loot the mob. If the player loots the mob and then leaves the quest item - it then becomes FFA. You are very adamant about something you are so wrong about.
---
As long as this matches what was in vanilla I’m all for it.  But getting of things cause they’re “op” according to today’s standards nope.
---
&gt;aoed for a few levels
---
As one does.
---
Good Lord that must've been boring.
---
They thought we didn't. Then Wow Classic started pulling 70,000 viewer streams on weeknights.
---
As you said you wanted to focus on PvP I strongly suggest going dwarf over human. Stoneform is just much better than perception and the other human racials don't matter in PvP. Just because you can cleanse poisons and diseases doesn't mean it isn't really nice to be able to become immune to viper sting and have an additional way to get rid of blind. Also you get a tiny bit of frost resistance...
---
My man!

Streamers don't care about testing. News at 11.
---
Is this happening every single evis, or just sometimes? IIRC, getting an extra swing off sword spec resets your swing timer, so if it only happens occasionally then this may be the answer.
---
Wasn't it a BC thing, tho?
---
Since saying 3 months is soul crushing.
---
Why should people stick to English? Nowhere does it say you’re post must be in English. If people want to make posy in their language let them. 
---
You bothered that much by it?
---
They need to remember that this is the game that had 10 million subscribers. Not BfA.

Skunky beer. No thanks.

See you ugly alliance !!!!
---
But remember that when classic launches a lot of people will be contesting nodes and pservers have higher spawn rate of material nodes. Nodes will be difficult to come by when everyone is trying to level their professions as they level.
---
&gt;Classic was the most casual friendly game.   
---
Uh, I wouldn't say so. 
---
Vanilla is much more unforgiving than modern WoW when it comes to questing and doing 5-man dungeons for example. In retail, running dungeons is like a speedrun. There isn't much method to it. Just mass pull and blow everything up. Conversely in vanilla, pulling a couple of mobs too many easily results in a party wipe. This dichotomy also pertains to questing: in vanilla, you have to be VERY careful with pulling too many enemies, but in retail, you don't have to worry too much as you can breeze through droves of enemies. What about grinding for raiding mats in vanilla? It's hardly something for casuals. What about collecting money for a mount? It's no small amount.   
---
So I disagree with vanilla being more casual-friendly.
---
I'm sorry. Are you trying to make a point?
---
Well you brought up the topic about my software testing background, I didn't. I just don't think grinding 40 in a dungeon is grade A testing or even C for that matter and judging by the responses I'm not the only one. But thank you for being part of the discussion.
---
&gt;  To me the vanilla graphics are timeless
---
Good thing definitions aren't based on your own interpretation of them. They are very clearly out dated, it's not even worth arguing over.
---
They remastered Spyro and Crash Bandicoot and they feel just as good as they did back in their time. More so than if it was some blocky bullshit that you can barely tell is a face or an ass. Nostalgia puts you back in the head space of older games. Having worse graphics that age terribly doesn't do that since back then you weren't looking at the old graphics and admiring how shit they are.

No you should and will be banned for it.  I hope they do what they use to do and literally delete everything you own too when you get caught

I would get several totem or sap from rogue. I prefer go without them.

There is also chance hunter pulls extra with pet and hunter rolling melee wpns. Too risky and less benefit compared other classes.

Yes, you don't even need to wait until the mage is 60 to start the warrior. If you alternate, you can make the most out of that blue xp bar, and also change fight style.
---
&gt;Blizzard didn't hold the event. blizzard didn't organize the prize pool or money, and blizzard isn't invovled with how the event is carried out.

By this logic the bar for any sort of griefing or suspending is so high as to not exist.

As to your blackjack example, they aren't merely standing there giving advice. They're jumping up and strutting over the tables and kicking the cards out of the dealer's hands. Courts say yes, by the way.

Orc Warrior was my #1 pick. Class guides from youtube scared me into going orc hunter.  A friend of mine is going priest and that made me go back to warrior. After putting some thought into it I concluded he'll be a casual and quit in a month or two. I'm still going Warrior, fuck it. Saw some people saying that tailoring/enchanting can be good for warrior leveling if you do a lot of dungeons which is an option. My initial plan was going mining/blacksmithing (for that sweet axesmithing market) but I think nodes will be contested as fuck in the first days..
---
Haha well good luck to you. Frost gets boring af

Got ur back m8

Bet 1g:
---
* 1 to 649 = -1g
---
* 650 to 849 = +1g
---
* 850 to 950 = +2g
---
* 951 to 1000 = +3g
---
64.9% of the time, you lose 1g.
---
20% of the time, you make 1g.
---
10.1% of the time, you make 2g.
---
5% of the time, you make 3g.
---
That means your average roll on a 1g bet loses you 9.7s.
---
The house needs to accept ~52g in bets every hour to make 50g per hour.
---
Not true. Group loot applies to the mobs drop table, not quest items. Meaning someone can loot the quest item before you, but you still get the cloth/vendor trash items from the mob. 
---
What's so hard?
---
Putting that into perspective hurts my virtual wallet, and if my math is right it would cost 100g more to train every ability. 182.68 for every hunter skill. Yikes
---
its also possible that the quality of the product warrants a higher cost, and is aimed toward a market of people to whom 1000 dollars is not very much money, and who seek more nice things to compliment their nice things.
---
You are comparing casuals of 2005 to casuals of 2019 wrapped up in the instant gratification scheme.. 
---
Casuals of 2005 played WoW to quest. Meet people. And explore the world, remember it is the WORLD OF Warcraft. World exploration and leveling was the content. It was the most casual friendly because you were pushed into the world with a vague idea of what to do and told to have fun. You could explore the world at level 1. You'd die a lot.. but people did it. 
---
Don't confuse end game progression for content. Most of your time will be leveling and meeting people.
---
Did anyone realize the Monitor comes without a stand right? so if you buy the monitor alone it will just sit on your desk like a tablet.

I mean go fuck yourself APPLE.

I can’t believe they literally went for a substitution cipher lol
---
 Dps2: Shaman. Just for totems.
---
I'd love to see a shaman just drop a totem or two then..sit down...
---
They have more functionality than just totems.
---
If you are going to put a shaman in a group, I highly suggest doing a melee based group.
---
No that stuff grossed me out when I was a kid. It also makes me think about fedora wearing neckbeard style gamers who eat nothing but pizza rolls and cheetos with their mountain dew. It makes me embarrassed to be associated with that crowd.
---
I have bad eyesight, So I kind of wish they would split the setting up for Players and NPC's  
---
In PvE, it was super helpful for me.
---
No. No matter how you dye it mtn Dew is still sweetened piss. Besides the product came years after Vanilla was over. On top of that all the cringe campaigning over the years Mtn Dew and Doritos have done... it's... just... I don't want Classic to be associated with those brands.
---
Standard office chair is usually the best honestly. Like markus from Ikea is fairly priced and quite nice https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/
---
That's the one I'm using but chairs is pretty subjective.
---
Check out Kargoz on YouTube he's got some great classic guides

Listen... listen... hey... listen...

You will never CC effectively against a paladin. The only thing you can do is force a bubble then CC the paladin. Otherwise ole cleanse will handle all your hard work.

I love the ratchet inn!
---
Fun fact Mt. Dew was formulated to be mixed with the moonshine that it is named after.
---
Thank you, didn’t really understand the video very well , u said to cast multi or aimed during the red phase. Whilst in the last segment where u demonstrated for pvp on 2 stags. U cast the multi shot in the white bar ? In which phase do I load the shots ? Red right ?
---
My goal is to get to level 8 I think on release day, then try to run around in the first area gathering mats and mob killing for a while just to level up blacksmithing and such. Let the masses push ahead of me and and then the next day start the next grind so on and so forth.
---
This hit me so hard
---
Wouldnt they want a shield if were talking pvp?
---
Soda is comically sweet after not drinking it for a few years

Thank you kind person for being helpful.

Our rose tinted vision, shattered. That's what you meant, right?

About 3/5ths

They’re not the worlds best doing it on easy. If they want to race for world first on hard, then maybe they can call themselves the best.
---
If you drink shit like  this you should really take a look at your health and make some changes...
---
Try water :)
---
The couple times I have tested it myself, my OH would hit twice right before my MH would reset and swing again. I purposefully casted right before I would swing again with my MH. I started testing it myself after seeing it on streams. This was at lvl 15. I probably need to get a swing timer addon to see what’s actually going on, will update later. 
---
I remember sword spec swing reseting the timer, but should an a combo spender do the same?
---
It is small, all the mobs are aggro, the quest drop rates are pitiful and you’re left with only red quests by 14.
---
I shelled out for a dxracer gaming chair. 
---
The con: it’s very expensive (although most non ikea furniture is, I’ve come to realize). 
---
The pro: it really is amazingly comfortable. 
---
Worth noting: I have severe scoliosis and sitting is generally painful for me. In that chair I can last hours without being bothered by it
---
People are confusing good with optimal.  Disc isn’t bad.  You can level just fine as disc.  Shadow is faster but disc can level just fine
---
Still so mad I threw my bottles away during one of my “I’m done with WoW” periods :(
---
Do it
---
nope
---
They are indeed the best if you throw method against any guild with any rules they will come out on top, they are the most committed to the game without question
---
Dang. I'm so torn! Is there a decent hemo build perhaps?
---
I'm still dumbfounded that Apple released a computer for $6,000, with an optional monitor for $5,000, with an optional monitor stand for $1,000...
---
Testing dungeon farming for exp is valuable testing, but you have a personal bias so I don't expect anything different from you.
---
Shaman are incredibly strong, fun (if you like supportive roles), and always in demand. Managing totems makes healing a bit more interesting and you aren't stuck reapplying blessings to people like paladins. Druid has it's uses and can be really fun to play, but I personally think it's incredibly boring to raid heal as a druid. Priest is the quintessential healer in vanilla, always good, always wanted, and definitely has a higher population. 
---
With shaman you have chain heal which is super fun to and satisfying to use, a million totems to make you suited for any encounter, and everyone loves you.
---
\^\^ This... I worked at Brady for years. This is also the reason information in the guide was occasionally outdated at release. Information on final patches was not always available before the books went to print.
---
Yeah but they all have tiny fucking shoulderpads so who really wins here?
---
Steelcase Leap.   
---
Yes it is expensive, but you'll have it long enough to make it worth while regardless. Very configurable, good for tall people, large people (they sell an "XL" version), and everyone inbetween.
---
While that all may be correct, horde will still have significantly better racial abilities. And on top of that you can’t discount how overwhelming numbers of the most popular twitch streamers are going horde for classic.
---
&gt;By this logic the bar for any sort of griefing or suspending is so high as to not exist.
---
DING DING DING we have a winner!
---
That's the point.
---
I construed "casual-friendly" as being easy. Yeah, modern WoW has a different philosophy. It's all about raiding and amassing gear whereas vanilla is more about adventuring, so I suppose in that regard it's more casual. True that.
---
im in the same boat. war or pala? for me im more swaying towards ret paladin, the leveling experience is more managable and vs dead (sholo/strath) you can do some serious numbers with holy damage abilites, exorcism + consecration. 
---
in PVP even as ret the heals and bubbles you'll be able to throw around will be invaluable, blessing of freedom on the flag carrier..? :)
---
im looking forward to the sketchy seal of command too, i miss the original. 
---
not of a fan of fury or the thought of having to stance dance again. the competition for 1h weapons too... ? nah. not this time round. 
---
basically suck it up for the 2 nights and be a meme boi
---
You could turn all the raid tiers around and say Naxx was t1 and MC t3. And nothing in case of immersion would change. 
---
You could be killing Zombies on Horde side since lvl1 and still die to a wolf 1shot in another Zone.
---
it was rarely ever about immersion. Just Gameplay mechanics.
---
I'm not even talking about changing it for Classic. But Idealizing thise Idea of 1tier difficulty, just because that's how it was in vanilla, is bullshit.
---
ha sounds pretty good! nelf or orc for wpvp? I have to think shadowmeld would be incredibly useful despite the orc 5% damage bonus
---
TBC is vanilla+
---
TBC retained the classic spirit, with no paradigm shifts in the design or feel of the game.
---
Just don't let him go DW fury from the get go. DW is only good at really really good gear. Level as 2h Fury (or 2h arms) until 40 and then go arms for Mortal Strike until some gear at 60. Leveling 40-60 without mortal strike is just painful.
---
There is no easy or hard mode you are making up modes that don't exist. The best play to be the best, they don't hamstring themselves with fake house rules
---
If they were truly the best they wouldn’t be doing it the easy way.
---
Redridge.
---
This one doesn't have the Apple logo on it either! Unless it's on the back, can't tell from the website.
---
Get out there and watch some streams. Lots of people leveling every class at every available level. It's not the tactile approach but it might save you some time.
---
Yeah I'd rather see them collab with a sparkling water or tea or coffee company. By 2019 I think most people have figured out how gross soda is.
---
There are macros to shift out of bear form, use a potion or engineering item, and then shift back immediately.
---
It’s not a made up thing. One way is clearly easier than the other.
---
Yeah and the patriots should use kids on the offensive line to prove they are the best lol
---
they should at least put these on the launcher
---
As an european, I don't Know what this is
---
mage+rogue for cc.
---
manatide totem and rest totems for melee dps to ench+rogue+prot tank.
---
-Enchanting  to 265 
---
-Kill Lord Roccor in BRD for Plans:Smoking Heart of the Mountain
---
You have 3 choices after that, 
---
PVP (expensive): Engi/Blacksmithing and use cancelform macros combined with useful trinkets/potions and iron grenades (blacksmithing is for the fear trink)
---
PVE &amp; Gold Wary: Herb/Alch is my personal fav. Speed around entangling mobs to pick herbs and travel form away. Use alch so you arn’t bothering people, assist guildies, and can bring ingredients on progression nights for a bigger potion count in the bag. Also get an Xmute cd for all the TF and Rag boys farming their Arcanite.
---
Lastly, if your guild makes you the go-to enchanter you can keep enchanting since you already leveled that bitch, be (hopefully) one of the first people with raid enchants like +healing and farm tips in org. 2nd profession could be either a gathering profession like herb or engineering if you’re keen to pvp and flag carry.
---
God speed on the feral! Played one through BWL on a not-so-classic vanilla serv and it performed well. Keep your head up and stay in touch with other feral tanks; Don’t let bad RNG or nay-sayers deter you from a fun, viable spec.
---
How to get a new chair, whenever you want, for ~$15:
---
1. Go to the office supply store, pick whatever chair you want.
---
2. Buy the ~$15 3rd party protection plan/warranty with the chair.
---
3. Keep the receipt in a safe place.
---
4. In a couple months, make a claim against the chair. "It squeaks and the padding has worn out, causing nerve pain in my elbows" works fine.
---
5. They will send you a check for the full amount of the chair.
---
6. Repeat whenever the chair actually wears out, or just fill your house with nice office chairs.
---
It was!
---
Fair point, but the evidence against it is that the game is going to be free with a subscription to the retail game.  The retail game (love, hate, or tolerate it) is where is money is coming from.  
---
What you're asking for with a Classic Plus, is a whole new game for development.  And while that's is a fair thing to ask for, it's not what I believe drove the outcry that got us to where we are today.  To me, it sounds like you want WoW2, not WoW Classic.
---
Anyone have a similar list for Horde —&gt; alliance?
---
Go warlock. Always in high demand because of what they bring to the group. Rogues have lock picking. Meh. And there's a much higher population of rogues than warlocks. Especially if you're going alliance.
---
Yes but it's not a supported mode of course making bad raid comps is harder but it race is the race
---
I went to home Depot and cut a piece of shelf board to lay across the arms of my recliner.
---
Works great if you are a warlock since you get a free mount. Leveling professions is costly so be ready.
---
By that logic why use gear? That's just easy!
---
Deathwing?
---
You can fuck right off with TBC. Arena's, Pvp gear, flying mounts, homogenizing classes. Nah TBC was garbage... I hope for ya'll to get the TBC server you want. However keep your chocolate away from my peanut butter.
---
This helped immensely, thank you for your time writing this! I'll be rolling together with 2-3 friends. If either rolls priest/shaman/druid I will go warrior, else I'll probably get a shaman or druid myself. Thanks again for your writeup!
---
Oh shit, bfa forshadowing this early
---
It has timestamps for when the other discussions start. I usually only listen to a segment or two that I'm interested in.
---
This is the most cuck ass line of thinking and is why Apple is going to continue to sell ordinary things for thirty times their worth.
---
They should get knocked down, that would be fun.
---
Maybe.  Who are you?
---
Probably has a higher body count than the Night King from all the lowbies he's killed over the years
---
I plan to do exactly this as well. My only concern is gearing at 60 to make this build effective. Do you have to roll on balance items while healing raids?
---
There is only cc from mage.
---
I want to replace rogue with hunter. I get second cc for example dm.
---
I honestly don't care if TBC exists or not.
---
could take it or leave it. it's definitely a lot of free money for them, though. i'd be surprised if they didn't strike a deal with blizzard
---
Spent all week looking at chairs.  Settled on the Neuechair, but it's $550 which is know is very high for most.
---
It's the only chair that competes with the 800-1200 chairs.  I'm investing in my body because I've already done a decade and a half of serious damage and really need to care more.
---
Ikea has some $200-300 chairs that have a lot of adjustments as well.
---
If you buy a gaming "racing" chair with a bucket seat, I promise you're not helping your back.
---
Good luck!
---
S'all good mate
---
Blizzard made bears and prot pally with the full intent of being tank viable. Everyone found the easy tank and went with that. Wanna be good? Do it the hard way. I’m not considering anyone good who just does the typical warrior tank.
---
Enchanting is a great option for any class and I do not want to steer you from that if you like the idea. You can find some great money making recipes from dungeon bosses while getting BiS pre-raid gear if you are lucky and make a lot of connections/gold through little effort of your own.
---
However, if you initially wanted to go blacksmithing you definitely should. With how contested mining nodes will be it would be silly to level mining as you level..or maybe even at all. If layering is as explained come launch and enough people pick double gathering professions for gold making while they level then the market will be SATURATED with ore for blacksmithers/engineers to purchase on the cheap. If that happens you could even go blacksmithing/enchanting and while you'd be investing a lot into them to level them the turn-around at 60 will be great. Especially if you manage to grab a rare recipe or two.
---
Suggestion: Look up a guide on leveling blacksmithing 1-300, they were everywhere in vanilla (make sure it's not a priv server guide), it will tell you exactly what you need as far as how much of each ore, what to craft with the ore for guaranteed points and what misc items you need. That way as you level you can periodically check the AH for those things and grab them at low points to store in your bank for when you're higher level and ready to level BSing. Hope this helps!
---
More like WoW 1.5 but yeah kind of.
---
I've had both versions of the Markus (the cloth seat and the leather seat) and make sure you spend the little extra for the leather. The cushion is nicer and the armrests get padding that way too, whereas with the cloth version it just has hard plastic armrests.
---
Game fuel is released in both flavors now. I can find them in gas stations all over.
---
Doesn't work when you tanking a big mob, you get one shotted in that time.
---
Way too person specific.
---
My wife can sit in her chair and only her chair for hours with no issues, I sit in her chair for 5 mins and it's killing my back. 
---
I usually go to office Depot, and sit in all the chairs at least twice, then the final candidates I pull up to a demo desk and sit in until the employees get nervous, Then price check the same chair on amazon.
---
Some chairs feel great for the Flop down, but really get uncomfortable after all the air seeps out 20 mins later or so. When my old chair breaks, it's not uncommon for me to buy and give away 3 or 4 chairs before I can find a long term "good one" and then I'll use that one until it just can't be patched back up any more.
---
idk I kinda like the hard plastic.
---
Or play to win not with rules you made up
---
Had this happen to me, too. Said that my character was moved off of my account and is now associated with someone's [battle.net](https://battle.net) account so they couldn't recover it for me. Was pretty bummed.
---
Of the three, warlocks will be in highest demand because the other two will have a lot more people playing them. They'll all do good damage. Mage might have portals, but a warlock has utility too. Since you're playing with a prot warrior and not playing a healer or hybrid, as a warlock you can soulstone your prot warrior friend in case he ever dies and you can give him healthstones for free healing. Also summoning stone makes you really attractive for raids since most guilds will not have enough warlocks, meanwhile they'll all have too many mages and rogues.
---
Agreed, well said man
---
Killabee chairs. Affordable and comfy. And big, for when you gain those WoW lbs.
---
The best computer chair I ever had was a lazyboy recliner.
---
Uther is a piece of shit and anything BUT a real hero, screw that guy.
---
It’s piss yellow
---
does your target's name plate and health bar under the name show from very far, say 60yds?
---
I appreciate the response! You helped make my decision, mage it is! I guess min/max gnome is the better choice? From all the polls on this sub it seems as though mage is one of the top choices for everyone. Hopefully it won’t be as competitive finding a raid guild! Thanks again!
---
M+ is a good system for where the game is now, but the effect it's had on other game systems, especially gearing, has made the game a lot less enjoyable for me. I also personally just don't enjoy running the same dungeons over and over again for 2 years.
---
We would play poker in raid chat while people were afk or flying out. Macro to roll 5 lines of 1-13 or some such nonsense.
---
The "best" spec for leveling really depends on how.
---
For soloing, shadow is going to be the spec with the best survivability and best damage output. Disc will just leave you lacking.
---
Personally, way, way back before BC, I found that I not only leveled overall faster but was better geared through the entire process by leveling as holy and chain running instances. I had a hard time not finding a group, I got a ton of fantastic practice on playing the class, learning mana efficiency, and managing healing aggro, etc. and the exp was great.
---
Holy grouping would be my over all recommendation but if you would prefer to solo, shadow beats smite spam.
---
That is true. Cant have dream setup all the time. 
---
But I will not go anywhere without mage thats for sure. I will suck d for their drinks and cc.
---
Well in classic shes a Night Elf with a tint.
---
Sounds like warrior would be the better choice for you.
---
&gt;Once you have 24 Linen Cloth and ding 10, pay 10c to grab tailoring at the first major town, /yell "Free bags! Your mats, just 6 Linen Cloth!" Accept the the first 66 Linen you get. Make the bolts until your skill is 45, learn Linen Bag, make the 15 bags, give 11 of them away. Then drop Tailoring and pick up whatever two professions you want.
---
I'll use this thank you
---
Blocking quest givers with large mounts, bypassing ignore using in-game mail, and creating new characters or spamming mail with unvendorable items have all been suspendable offences at one point or another. There's a large grey area between ganking lowbies or dragging mobs onto them and harassing the player via game mechanics. 
---
It's not unreasonable to say that people on level ones bodyblocking duels and totems interferes with the intention of the duel mechanic. I think even, intuitively, it comes a lot closer to the latter type of harassment (targeted, disruptive, unavoidable) than the former (in-game combat / manipulation of mobs).
---
I’m taking the first day off, and I plan to get my wife a spa day or something, then just cracking open a cold one with the boys in Dun Morogh.
---
Male Tauren /train, hands down
---
I’m not familiar with hemo at all
---
You hold strafe (usually A D or Q E ) and then correct movement with mouse while holding rightclick, yes you want to face the opponent at all times so that you can parry/dodge and so your spells don't get interrupted.
---
Lol made my day
---
I only watched a bit of the video, but I didn't see any keyboard turning. It was all too quick. He was definitely using the right mouse button and mouse movement to turn the camera to stay facing his enemy.
---
These are duels where people are allowed to use non-class items like bombs, pots, and other consumables. So I assume "all bets are off" in terms of rules. Anything goes.
---
If you watched Mn actually get first 40, you would see he wasnt with all randoms. They were 4 APES and 1 random.  All geared to the teeth 
---
And he also Said ”if you are AHEAD of the Zerg quests are most likely better” 
---
And also,  he clarified that hes doing this since everyone was capped at 30 for a while so the quest zones would be packed - as in middle of the zerg.
---
I think someone posts this once a week
---
&gt; I’m confused since the book wasn’t published until 2018
---
Where in the world did you get this from?
---
Mango/pineapple vodka is bomb with it. Can confirm.
---
This, it’s worth the price.
---
What makes you think he's not turning with a mouse?
---
Yeah, 5k \*might\* be okay, but I seem to recall that that was already too much from when I played on private servers. I might remember wrong, though. 
---
&gt; I don't expect most people to get 60, even less will raid past MC/Ony. 
---
Yeah, that's fine, though. I hope people understand, especially those who come from modern WoW, that vanilla isn't about rushing to 60 and raiding ASAP. 
---
&gt; they tend to be 4-7k until the next big server launches and the population moves on. 
---
This is what always irked me about private servers. People would play on a server for a while and then rush to the next "FRESH!!!" without any deliberation. It created this disjointed experience with people constantly jumping servers.
---
In order to reach the audience, you must use the platform. \~ Morgan Freeman
---
I cannot EXACTLY describe my reasoning, but I've always disliked Heroic variants of raids and dungeons. The raid should be the challenge not the mode. Not everyone should get to see everything, if you suck and refuse to get better and play harder then why should you be allowed to do what everyone else can? 
---
There's something satisfyingly simple about "I've cleared X", no frills no nonsense just.. yeah I did that. No empty feeling when you get the LFR version of the weapon you really wanted, no lost rolls to titanforge, just... the drop is the drop. Congrats, move on to farming your next major piece.
---
I still have a hardtime accepting the fact that the market for ''idiot with too much cash'' is that big =/
---
He's not wrong about overwatch league and the whole eSport branch of Blizzard, I don't know where you're taking your information to counter his point...
---
HoTs been canceled, D3 and SC2 been on maintenance mod for at least 2 years now. Blizzard quit releasing numbers on WoW a while ago (2015)but trust me when I say that there is a not a lot of people playing this game in NA right now... 1.7Mil in the last leak of late 2018, so yeah ride his dick good mah boi!
---
Did people actually tank in Fury? Never noticed that.
---
You yourself said that the only people who remember it wrong are I quote 'pserver kiddos'.
---
That is just plain wrong as I pointed out. 
---
Of course classic was manageable for experienced groups nobody argues against that. But most people were not like that and nowdays the average player is way better than the average player then. 
---
You argued that this is not true and said everybody who thought it was hard is a pserver kiddo.
---
Next duel should be immediate with no rest (players eat to full hp and go). Other than that only rules should be, no buffs or potions and SL is banned.
---
If someone dc's or isn't ready to duel right away, they forfeit that duel.
---
probably best to just run a gathering profession and then give the mats to someone who bothered to grind the crafting skill.  If you wear cloth/leather this is mega-easy, less so for plate wearers because mining isn't nearly as convenient.
---
Thanks for the shoutout. There were a ton of issues with the hunter bar release and I think I finally ironed them out with v3.3.0  [https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/weaponswingtimer/files](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/weaponswingtimer/files)

Keyboard turning is not optimal.  For one it’s too slow, for two it eats up keybinds, and for three you could be using those fingers to be on other abilities in order to react faster to certain moves.  For example on my rogue I have my middle finger hit my rotational moves and my pointer finger on my kick against casters so its already there if I need to kick ASAP.  If it’s on my keyboard turning then I slowing down my potential kick.
---
The last 3 posts I opened are all pure trollery, but I can't actually tell if they're trolling hard or just pessimistically dense. This sub is getting really fun.
---
Tank: Druid. Great buffs and does amazing damage while tanking.
---
Healer: Shaman. Totems and can use everything from mail to cloth. Also can help dps on trash without burning mana thanks to WF.
---
DPS1: Warrior. Somebody has to pick up all that plate gear, and with Druid tanking with swipe they should be free to spam cleave and WW for some nice cleave damage.
---
DPS2: Rogue. Best DD, synergy with druid's LotP, warriors BS, and shamans WF totems.
---
DPS3: Warlock. Best synergy with a heavy melee group. Lots of threat going around, so multi dotting is probably not going to pull onto you. CoR to support the melee. Pet can also benefit from all the melee buffs being tossed around when not seducing. With Soulstones and the shaman's reinc, this group is never going to need to run back after a wipe. Lifetap means you can keep up with the melee where mages will do more dps, but then need to stop and drink.
---
Probably should have built the group around a priest since that's what you're playing, but I thought I'd answer in the abstract.
---
They kind of switched the teams during Legion.

It's like real chap brand soda but worse. I have no idea how they stay afloat. Never have I ever seen someone state mtn Dew is my favorite brand of soda. Maybe it's just awful here... not sure
---
the reason it cost 999 is because apple brainwashed their customer base into believing everything they do is ''high-end'' and that their minor cosmetic feature worth tripling the price.
---
oh and... nothing work with apple if it's not from apple, of course.
---
I meant fury warriors who occasionally offtank things.
---
They can’t loot it before because they don’t have permission to loot the mob. You can test it for yourself. Make a character with me on the beta and I will show you.

That's a really disingenuous description of the vanilla models, to the point where I'm pretty sure your eyes don't work or you're just being a condescending troll.

I had a bottle of the Halo 3 game fuel that I never opened and just had in my mini fridge since 2007. 
---
My sister-in-law drank it on Thanksgiving last year.
---
I was sooooo mad.
---
Thanks sheldon.
---
No way man. and Loose out on the highest DPS melee weapon in the bracket? You try to keep your distance, but when that rogue is spamming sinister strike on you or kicking you, you can still hit him for a huge Windfury
---
Consider female undead too - I kind of like their casting animations more than the male.

He is definitely turning with the mouse. Keyboard turning is a lot slower.
---
Did you just assume my kinks?
---
I was looking everywhere to buy these...never saw one.
---
You just answered your question yourself. No one knows. That’s why you’re getting the answers you’re getting.
---
My point was the group comps weren't organised around being speed dungeon groups - they were just whoever from the guild was there and keen at the time. Rogues have very poor aoe. The fact that they had 2 and were server first to 40 says a lot about how much faster a planned group could be.
---
I think it'll bring in a lot of new players. I don't think I'm alone when I say that I haven't been interested in subbing for a very long time now but with classic coming back, it's time to game.
---
I’m going to go out on a limb here and say any DPS Shaman won’t have Manatide Totem.
---
He is complaining that he can't get into lfr because of ilvl restrictions. BC had no lfr. 
---
Just replace heroic BC Dungeons with Mythic BfA Dungeons. It's exactly the same. Form a Group and get into the Dungeon.
---
This is nothing but complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
Yeah Wrath portrayed Arthas a lot more sympathetically, what with the final cutscene (dying in his father's arms), and the questline under ICC with the child form of Arthas. IIRC, in the books, Arthas is depicted as the most maleficent facet of the Lich King's being, whereas Ner'zul was trying to hold back.
---
Thanks this will definitely be used by me
---
He could stream other games though to make money and play classic in his free tome like the rest of us “normal” people do. 
---
I’m not claiming I know anything about his personal life, but I’m assuming he has enough money to spend his time however he wants... at least from how I’ve hear him and others talk about it.
---
Yeah cause I’m sure you won popularity contests in school too!
---
Ah that makes sense, but at 60 ele shamans go shield?
---
What about torso not turning while strafing?
---
I've seen it and referenced it for some of the functions used in the hunter bars. Whoever uploaded that is a saint.
---
I'll be skipping the first two wings of SM as. Warrior tank. I'll make a pit stop in armory if anyone is looking for it at the time just for herods axe but more than likely I'll be subbing  SM for uldaman at 40
---
Priest leveling comes down to Spirit Tap and Wand Spec. Pick one or the other for faster leveling, pick both for ludicrous speed. Leveling is  not really about doing decent damage to mobs so much as it is about efficiency.
---
He's definitely not keyboard turning.

That chair better be comfy as hell.

I'd like to swap shoulderpads out for more appropriate terms.

What is the Quest Mount that the Alliance have? You mean the Paladin mount? I'm rolling Alliance and if there is some mount reward that isn't the paladin one, I'd like to know about this lol.
---
I remember raiding Hyjal in BC and Archimonde was like this. I really wouldn't want to do that fight without decursive. So. much. running. 
---
Priority 1: Don't die 
---
Priority 2: Slow Fall/Blinkfall (see priority 1) 
---
Priority 3: Decurse, Decurse, Decurse
---
Priority 10: Keep up scorch
---
Priority 50: DPS.

4-5k is like a private server. I think more would be perfectly fine.

Go to an office store and let your ass be your guide.
---
I’m looking to roll a healer when classic releases and I want your guys opinions on what to pick.  I’m torn between Paladin, Shaman, and Priest in that order starting with Paladin as currently most interested.
---
I started playing in Burning Crusade and have been a Priest main the entire time, and Holy Paladin was my alt.  But I never played vanilla so I’m not sure how differently they will play from what I am used to.  Shamans I have never played so I’m open to trying something new.  Druids I have no interest in.
---
Mainly I’m wondering is who brings the most support/utility, not just raw healing.  And who is the most “busy”.  Like I loved Holy Paladins in BC/Wotlk even though they essentially just spam flash of light, they had tons of utility to manage.  All the different hands, buffs, auras really made me feel like I had a lot of control in mitigating bad situations.  Priests have the more engaging healing rotation, but I don’t feel have as much utility outside of raw healing power.  I have heard shamans are more micro-intensive and difficult to master, which is kinda what I’m looking for but I have no personal experience to base that off of.
---
Tl;dr:  What healer do you think makes the best support, who do you think is the best pocket healer?
---
yea... no. i would prefer the cross realm bg in favor of a long ass queue and dealing with faction imbalance etc.
---
It depends on your end-game content options tbh. If you plan to raid seriously then I would go with a warrior. I was an Ashkandi wielding billy badass at 60. Fury warriors for dps were not the norm during MC/BWL progression because their dps numbers had not been properly theorycrafted or tested by every guild. Thus, I as the MT got most of the plate dps gear I wanted and the first Ashkandi. I have fond memories of sword spec procs (even with Untamed Blade and OEB) on a MS one shotting people in WPvP and BGs. They are the kings of PvP once the gear is available. Phase 3-6 is a hardcore warrior's dream and no you don't need BiS to be a monster.
---
The Paladin situation will almost certainly be a headache UNLESS you are a hardcore going for Rank 14 type of guy. Raids will not want you. Dungeons will take you but there isn't optimal PvP or PvE gear for Ret in 5-mans until the ZG/end of BWL phase catch up gear is added. I would only suggest Ret IF you have a guild promising you guaranteed raid spot and primary Ret gear (T2/Lava from Domo/Hand of Rag). There are WAY too many Ret players from priv servers who have incorrect data from those servers thinking they are going to pave the way in classic and I think there will be too many left spamming Trade for guilds.
---
I'm a casual player looking to get the most out of my first experience in vanilla.  I played some TBC as enh shaman which was pretty fun but hard to get groups with and I was never great with the totem twisting stuff.  Only managed to run Kara a handful of times due to my schedule at the time.   Late in the expansion I rolled a druid and a pally and enjoyed aoe tanking stuff with them. Wrath I mained the druid for flexibility, being able to spec feral or balance on one spec and dual spec resto but also made heavy use of the RDF to level multiple DKs, the paladin, and a warrior.  Again, I never really raided due to my schedule.  Maybe did naxx 2-3 times the whole expansion.  
---
Looking at classic I was thinking of rolling Mage because I remember sheep being so useful and being wanted for groups for it as well as the gold making potential from AOE and the pvp fun (is it the same frost spec for pvp/aoe?).  My worry with mage is how dang many there will be.  I also always wanted to play a hunter so have been considering that, though I worry a little about getting invites as a casual player that will quickly fall behind the main pack and having to give up a whole bag space for a quiver seems like it'll be an inventory nightmare.  Priest also looks like a solid option (though is pretty handily lower on my current options compared to mage/hunter) as I don't mind healing and it'll get me groups and MC looks fun!  I imagine farming will be tedious with it and I'm not sure how I'd like pvp healing/cant afford to respec back and forth.  Finally, I keep seeing the 0/30/21 druid pop up as being the ultimate flexible speck which sounds pretty great, being able to tank or heal or dps in a pinch.  Again with the bag issues though having to carry at least 2 sets of gear all the time...
---
Ultimately, I imagine I'll level multiple characters but unsure where to start...
---
I only care about it's existence if it gets into classic. I'm not against people getting TBC if they want but, I have no interest. 
---

Word has it that he’s in purgatory duking it out with Arthas in the Nexus.

Hey thanks for the well thought out explanation, I don’t plan on doing PvP with this guy so keeping enchanting and a gathering prof might be the most worthwhile set of professions

Joana
---
Yeah, because the belf model in classic was nightmarish
---
Shamans do not melt easily, just more easily than paladins. The real difference between the playstyles is that a paladin is a defensive healer, and a shaman is an offensive support class that heals. In group pvp, I'd take a shaman over a pally any day. Totems are incredibly versatile and strong, you have earth shock for a ranged interrupt, bloodlust, purge to allow your team to absolutely crush priests, and more. 
---
Seriously, just go look at the list of totems a shaman has available to him in vanilla. Things like tremor, grounding, and earthbind are well known and incredibly strong, of course windfury to give your warriors double attacks. But people often overlook how strong things like cleansing totem and fire resist totem are. Other group has a fire mage or a warlock? Fire resist totem is going to seriously piss them off. Other team has a rogue or hunter? Say goodbye to rogue poisons and hunter stings. You can use magma totem to break rogues out of stealth and prevent them from opening. There's so much to do, and it's all really fun. You know what you do as a paladin? Sit back and spam heal people. Maybe hammer of justice once a minute. It's boring.
---
Also you can go orc shaman for the stun resist racial. 25% chance to completely resist any stun? Haha, fuck you rogues and to a lesser extent warriors! Seriously, play a shaman. It's not even close.
---
That's the spirit of the game I loved. Just login. Get on your favorite dude. Go exploring and making friends. Then crush your enemies, see them driven before you.
---
[You can check out my guide about all the mounts in classic here!](https://classic.wowhead.com/guide=8296/classic-all-available-mounts-and-how-to-obtain-them-guide) The mount I was talking about was the [Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13086/reins-of-the-winterspring-frostsaber) mount, it requires a big quest grind until you get exalted with the Wintersaber Trainers faction.
---
To be clear, all servers will have more than 10k players.  The 10k (or 2.5k, etc.) refers to active players online at that time.  If you cut off character creation even at 10k, you’d need 100 servers per 1M CHARACTERS!  If only 3M people play, and everyone creates just two characters, that’s 600 servers.  That would be nutty.  No raids would ever form.  Etc.
---
Even Vanilla servers had 30-50k characters with only 2-3k online at a time.
---
I did this for about a year with several games. It was quite comfortable.
---
I dunno, raiding in TBC was much much harder. Guild jumping was extremely popular and raid content was largely inaccessible to a casual player. If you were pushing content patch to patch TBC required a lot more of you. In vanilla you could drag 10-20 people through a raid in TBC you’d be hard pressed to drag 5.
---
Eve online notably has about 35k consistent players but its SO consistent that it does great.
---
Well it's not besides the point, I was asking something off topic because you seemed to know.
---
i remember my side didnt have any high end crafting materials in wrath so i had to buy them from hordeside. now i had character there too so it was possible. after getting the transactions done and thinking im all clear my friend goes like, i still need another 1k or something ridiculous. fucking AH tax.
---
...obviously there exists a point at which Blizzard considers players have crossed the line, though, and it doesn't seem predicated at any level on whether that griefing is interfering with "Blizzard events" or not. 
---
1. There is griefing in World of Warcraft.
---
2. People can be suspended for particularly blatant examples of griefing (e.g. using mail to circumvent ignore).
---
/3 There is a point at which Blizzard considers griefing to be "over the line" and some standard by which they judge such.
---
I take this to be valid, and I don't really see what the fact an event is community-run or Blizzard-run has to do with whether any given act of griefing meets whatever their standard is.
---

&gt; Disc offers practically nothing for levelling outside of wand spec.   
---
Let's not go crazy.    
---
Shadow is fastest (w/Wand Spec). But Disc definitely offers some good leveling talents. You'd still need Spirit Tap from Shadow.      
---
 - Meditation/Mental Agility: +Mana Regen. -Mana Cost.     
---
 - Divine Spirit: Buffs Spirit Tap/Meditation +Mana Regen.   
---
 - Mental Strength: Larger Mana Pool    
---
 - Force of Will/Inner Focus/Power Infusion: More Pew Pew    
---
Shadow is faster, but Disc' is fine. I've seen some people level with a pocket warrior super efficiently with a Disc build (no OOM ever).
---
It does. I was sarcastically saying that all the content we had available in 1.12 should be available at launch.  
---
By saying this, I'm making the point that saying Xrealm BGs should be available initially, would make as large a difference in the experience as saying all the raids should be available at launch, or Dungeon set 2, or nightmare dragons.  
---
Because the discussion is on content. Not intricate class mechanics or the the ways the game changed mechanically.  
---
1.12 introduced as you mentioned, a slew of minor mechanic changes and visual updates that didn't impact the experience all that much (the haste change for example was to make haste/slow effects cancel eachother out, the rest of it were just tooltip corrections for consistency). That doesn't change the point I was making. It's already been confirmed that mechanically the game will not (they don't intend for it to) change during its classic vanilla lifecycle. But content will, and again that's the discussion - I'm saying that logically Xrealm BGs belong in phase 6 because they were introduced in 1.12, the same way that BWL belongs in phase 3, because it was released with 1.6.  
---
I then added that an argument could (COULD - meaning I'm not necessarily making it) be made for not having them in at all, because they were basically Blizzard having us beta test the arena queuing system for 2.0  
---
Saying I have to acknowledge every tiny change in 1.12 (and what, not want them?) because I want late-stage content at... A late stage? - is logically fallacious.  
---
TL;DR The discussion is on content not small mechanical patch-to-patch changes you dense motherfucker. Don't step to me with that weak shit.
---
There shouldn't be any rules at all. Anything goes. If you're not online to accept the next duel, you forfeit.

I'm guessing someone has, but they did intentionally remove it at some point due to totem stomping macros.

I dunno dude, some people enjoy drinking it but it literally comes out of mages , so i'll stick to ale!
---
You'd think so, but it gets awful really fast. I also used to be in the "more is more" club, but I actually realized that less is more, to an extent. Something like 3k sounds low, but the game plays much better with an amount like that. It was designed for such numbers. Going vastly above it is essentially unsupported.
---
It also works conversely, the ranged classes can hit the Tauren from further away. So it's effectively break-even.
---
no ty
---
Okay well yes, fury tanking is a thing, even fury tanking with no shield. It's all a matter of getting as much threat as possible so other fury warriors can go even harder on dps. It's a risky strategy because you are obviously more squishy, but it allows you to kill bosses and raids a lot faster. Shields and tank specs in vanilla isn't some magical double or triple in defense as it is in tbc or later expansions where any dps gets oneshot by any mob.
---
World quest loot scales to your ilvl and I only usually see maybe 10 or so pieces of gear available from WQs at any point in time. Even if all 10 pieces were different slots and for your spec and an upgrade for you, you still couldn't get that much of a jump in ilvl in one day just from WQs.
---
Now, I still agree that you can gear up too fast and to too high of an ilvl via WQs, but it's not as bad as you make it seem.
---
&gt;Ish-ne-alo por-ah, may the Earthmother smile upon you.

You are the warlock with improved Blood Pact AND better Stones!
---
lol i wish this were true. Paladins are one of the most susceptible classes to CC if not the most susceptible. You cant cleanse if your CC'd and your only way of breaking a CC are tied to long CD abilities that both share a sort of mini 60 second cool down before either one can be used again.

Word of honest advice: don't skimp on the chair. I used to use $60 Office Depot chairs until they wear out then get another. Splurging on a proper Serta/LazyBoy high-back office chair is one of the best gaming investments you can make.

warranty fraud is totally okay guys.

You need to go back to the point I was arguing against. You are removing context.

If it was a Blizzard hosted tournament, then of course Blizzard would prevent greifing. But its not Blizzar'ds job to step in when someone isn't letting you duel. Just because you have 100k+ viewers, or $125k prize money on the line doesn't make it more special, or warrant blizzard intervention.

Ok thank you, very interesting.

Pserver rules don’t Apply on real servers, SL is a legit ability which can be used.

There will be a lot of mages, but guilds need them the most. If you roll priest/rogue/mage, you will always be able to find a spot in a guild. The other classes are the ones where you're only bring 1-3 of them in an ideal situation.

r/unethicallifeprotips
---
Yes, I meant concurrent players, not total characters created.
---
Yeah thats why I wanted to pick shaman. Its still useful with my comp: war+rog+ench.
---
Unfortunally I cant svitch priest because of pvp reasons. I just want smooth dungeon experience, like decent and safe speed. I also have mage buddy to sit with me during drinks so Im not only one to wait and I get free drinks too. 
---
Also lock loses bit damage during cc and I can wand too. Warrior/Druid tanks can both buff rogue+shaman too.
---
Go for standard ikea/costco office chairs, or Herman Miller/Steelcase if you want high end. Avoid "gaming chairs" at all cost. I've had one for years and it's kindof a piece of junk. Really wish I just went with a Herman Miller instead.
---
Yeah we can all tell by your username that you have validation issues, especially with the bjj and that you've got to comment contributing absolutely nothing to threads with a got em or one liner...
---
Don't influence. If he loves the game enough to get to max level and wants to raid, he can just power level a raid worthy character or respec or find a more casual raiding guild. Either way, he'll be better playing what he finds most interesting :).
---
There shouldn't be a market for this though...

No, not really.
---
I like how some memes become so strong, they transcend subreddits. What a time to be alive.
---
This is perfect thank you, I think you solved my class picking issue
---
No.  Mountain Dew is nasty and has always been nasty.
---
All the pservers I’ve played lately lowered it to ~25g, and this was ok but 50g is ok too. 
---
A significant cost on respecs is good because it creates scarcity for specs that are solo/pvp-oriented. I think it’s better To think “ohhhhh yikes a shadoepriest we have to be careful”. Rather than have every priest not currently healing a raid to be shadow. Same goes for arms warriors, elemental shamans, etc. 
---
Expensive respecs also creates a ton of unique builds that try to compromise between group and solo play.
---
Only High elves existed in classic. I ran into that monstrosity in Loch Modan Hunter's Hall. I think she was missing a face texture or something.
---
Yeah I've given up soda but if this was a thing I'd be down to cheat a little.
---
Ah I see, is that based on AH prices in vanilla ? Do you think those prices might be higher when classic first releases since they will be in such high demand?
---
I mean I played Vanilla, and Im pretty sure there was far more than 5k. I can't say for sure, but there was people everywhere.
---
Another trick you can do with trolls is unequip all gear and reequip it - should give you 30% attack speed on openers or whenever you vanish. 
---
Also seems like Blood fury might scale with the white portion of attack power, which comes from +agi or +str. Green portion from buffs and +attack power gear doesnt seem to scale. Based on [private server](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=2685) research.
---
I dont think its good starter. You will lack cc and gear to be fully effective.
---
I’d buy a case fuck yeah

Yes, everyone's opinion on anything is based on their own bias/experiences/life.

Thank you for pointing this out it was crucial to the conversation and really promoted the health of our discussion.

Ikea Markus
---
It's not the same thing though, that's the point. I have a gas spring arm, and theres much more work to adjust and set it up. The apple stand is (supposed to be) quick to adjust, so you're paying for the convenience that their design brings. I mean yea a grand is a bit eyebrow raising, and you're of course paying more for the apple logo. But it's not a $50 rebranded monoprice mount.
---
I never played horde in classic so I can't comment on them. Priests are the main throughput healers, and you are bringing just enough paladins to get the buffs/auras you need, usually 4, but can get by with 3 or 5.
---
Nah you mix code red with livewire ;)
---
Nasty garbage drinks. Never understood that murica thing
---
I haven’t had soda in several years and I would buy this.

if the roles are reversed and the ranged class gets the jump, they can start shooting/casting 2 yards earlier though.
---
Part of me suspects that this was an attempt to get around the bot that detects reposts. Bellular's video was linked yesterday.
---
For PvP: Orc, no question.
---
For PvE DPS: Orc.
---
For PvE Tanking: Troll &gt; Undead &gt; Orc &gt; Tauren. You can still play an Orc, but blood fury becomes useless as a tank due to the healing debuff. Tauren extra HP is worthless until you're super low which you should never be anyway. As well, the AoE stun is only marginally useful for dungeons, not at all for raid bosses. Undead is 2nd to Troll for WotF and the natural shadow resist.
---
fruit.
---
trolls are better in guilds where threat is an issue, so anything tryhard.
---
When threat is an issue you have to optimize your gear so that you get as much threat and tankiness at the same time. Simply put troll racial gives more threat than tauren racials give tankiness.
---
I’ve had dxracers for the last 10 years. My first one lasted 8 years and some change for about 350$-400$, just got a new one. Wouldn’t get anything else. I can sit in this thing for 10+ hours a day and feel great.

Can you post your breakdown of the internal mechanism and how it's not new?
---
I do have access to beta :P
---
The old ones look better to some people and the new ones look better to some people.  But people can definitely say "old models look better".  To us, they just do.
---
Depends how serious you want to be. Hunters do mediocre raid DPS and min-maxing raids will only bring 1 Hunter.
---
Between Mages and Warlocks, Mages do superior DPS while Warlocks have really useful utility and party/raid support abilities. Both find spots in raids.
---
&gt;Was that an acceptable form of griefing?
---
There's no proper answer to your loaded question.  It wasn't griefing at all.  Morally it's a shitty thing to do, but from strictly a gameplay sense it's just pvp happened.
---
Its an amazing description of vanilla tauren. They literally DO NOT BEND THEIR KNEES. like a stick, When Pandaria was revealed, they talked about how the male Panda face had 3 times as many animations points compared to the entire tauren male model. 
---
Its ok to love this archaic, no frills, no resolution model. But I defiantly do not understand your disagreement or calling my disingenuous.
---
As someone that did every lockout up to where our guild was currently progressing every week while also grinding badges everyday, I disagree that it was easy to get geared. It took a lot of time and effort. Maybe it was less than Vanilla, but it wasn't fast.
---
Found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point. You must be a twitch mod the way you sweating their jocks.
---
If they are going 31 in resto why not Sham healer?  This will free up the last dps slot for any armor type
---
No, it does not, because the whole ordeal was completely avoidable. It is not possible for a level 10 player to avoid a warlock dropping a doomguard on them. It is completely possible to go to an area where a level 1 character is unable to survive and duel there.
---
Agree with most of that, but the additional crit chance gained from Intellect is minuscule.  You need about 60 Intellect at Level 60 to increase your crit chance by 1%.

Yeah, I buy up to 10 slot bags from the vendors with my gold from leather I vendor. When I get a better bag i just sell my replaced bag to nearby players for 80% of the purchase price. This is my core reason for skinning asap. I often times already have a couple 8 slot bags before some people even fill their 4 bag slots, because they're too cheap to buy a bag for 5 silver, lol.

Definitely someone already took it apart.
---

---
I'll have to wait until after work and test it again.  I think i couldn't click on certain things or my mouse just would disappear in game.  dropped it to 60hz from the windows settings, and 60hz in game and problem solved.
---
so that’s what liquid cancer looks like
---
Idk you the one that made a big wall of crying text.
---
Yeah, I'm not talking about implementing it into classic either. That would be impossible &amp; Gamebreaking.
---
I simply enjoy it as a viable alternative to raiding. The most you have to do is 1 Dungeon a week for the weekly Chest. Though I would love to see, how this System would function in a word without catchups / resets every raid tier and forging.
---
If you say so
---
catch him switching into battle/defensive and he cant rage the fear.
---
I started Wow on a laptop. To this day there is a small patch of skin just above my right knee where hair no longer grows. This shelf board idea is something I should have done back in the day.
---
I feel male night elves have decently large shoulder pads
---
Uh, is that all your claim is based on, that "there was people everywhere"? 
---
According to Mark Kern, a leading developer of the game back in the day, the absolute hardware limit was 3500-4000. As you can see, when asked if the cap was 3k, he responded "more or less".
---
You're wrong
---
IMO, duels should reflect the world pvp experience. When some shithead from the other side gets the jump on you, you're going to burn CDs, bandage, pot, engineering items, etc.... why should dueling be any different?  
---
As far as time between duels... again, reflective of world pvp. You can't tell that rogue to wait a few minutes because your big CD won't be up in time. Eat/drink up to full hp/mp; then you're ready.
---
Definitely would have made sense lore-wise, but screw that! Both classes are too important for one side to have exclusive access.
---
what kind of question is this? its obvious, we will be playing 1.12
---
Lol link me one post where that happened. I wont believe it until I see it. It's like saying you get downvoted for saying cancer is a shitty disease.
---
Achievement ain't the same as HM
---
Healer: Paladin
---
Tank: Warrior
---
DPS: Rogue
---
DPS: Hunter
---
DPS: Mage
---
2 people that want cloth (Paladin and Mage)
---
2 people that want mail/plate (Warrior and Paladin)
---
2 people that want leather (Rogue and Hunter)
---
All weapon types are covered too.
---
Unless the extra range doesn't apply to charge/intercept distance, the effect will be neutral. But I can still reach them further away when things get close or if I'm nova'ed, rooted, or slowed. 
---
I'll give it a test once the game comes out, but I dont see much downside to extra attack distance.
---
Shaman and Paladin as DPS are terrible. No, no, no, that's not how Classic is min/maxed.
---
Best all-around comp?
---
1. Warrior Tank
---
2. Priest / Paladin healer
---
3. Mage (portals + food)
---
4. Warlock (soulstone / healthstones)
---
5. Hunter or Rogue
---
This gives you all the CC flavors available in the game plus the essential dungeon running utilities without sacrificing DPS, TPS, or HPM.
---
Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi!
---
Stun resist is pretty sweet
---
Neither is mine, as I mentioned several times I totally understand and support the want for that different route. All I'm trying to convey to you is that there is literally a subreddit for that exact community. I also respect and support religious freedom, but I still wouldn't feel that it's okay for a christian missionary to randomly walk into a mosque with 129.000+ muslims in it and start preaching the gospel.  
---
That comparison might be a little strong, but I hope you understand. And I hope you understand what I'm trying to convey :)
---
You are right about the druids... i've played both alliance and horde.. but it always felt  as druids are more of an ally class.
---
I am playing a warlock in classic
---
They werent unplanned at all. Both tribe and Mn were specced to farm with ravager. 
---
To be fair i only actively watched 39-40. And at that time there was only 1 rogue. And a mage. 
---
I feel certain they though about it more than you think. But i could be wrong. Im just judging by what ive seen from them the years ive watched them. 
---
I still agree with his statement that questing is faster if you are ahead of the zerg. 
---
But we can see that it isnt entierly useless to farm 5mans. So i may just be arguing over nothing.
---
It's not fraud. You don't have to make up a reason for the claim. Any minor complaint will do.
---
And what does this have to do with classic wow?
---
I would suspect so, at some point, the DPS of caster weapons drops away from ones intended for melee DPS.
---
But they can surely sell it for $250.
---
Fuck yes!
---
Prices will be the same as all the mats are from quests and vendors. There's plenty of guides on the mount quest. Lvl40 is three clicks, the epic is a huge chain and pain in the ass
---
Cant because I will play priest healer for pvp. I prefer them over shamans.
---
And who would you pick for last dps? Lets say you have resto shaman ok and you got totems.
---
Warrior+Rogue+Hunter+Mage?
---
Ok so now you have Hunter+Rogue and warrior tank benefiting from totems. 3 melee classes.
---
In my setup Rogue+Ench shaman+Warrior tank = 3 melee classes.
---
At 60 yeah, which means you need less for 1% at 30. Anyhow, the manapool for mages/healers really does have a huge impact on aoe capacity as a grp
---
I don't particularly care what OP said, and the entire issue of whether it's a streamer event or not is tangential. I'm removing that context, sure - because it doesn't matter. Is it griefing, and against the TOS, and beyond what Blizzard considers reasonable? If yes, then they should step in. If no, then no. It doesn't matter if there were a hundred thousand people watching or zero. 
---
The argument that Blizzard should step in because it was ruining the experience for 125k viewers is one of practicality. You don't even need to make that argument to have a strong case against the griefing, and that's my point. If your belief is that streamer events shouldn't garner special privileges, my answer is that there should be nothing special about the punishment of the griefers anyway. That their actions affected more people should just push them up the priority queue.
---
Yeah dude, I joined TBC on launch, and I only got as far as 4/5 T4 on my ele sham
---
In gonna 2nd deleting items that are worthless. Everytime u return to town your xp per hour gets murdered. I loot all and delete few things when full if there's no good reason to hit town such as quests or spells
---
Yeah, but it's not even when I close the distance. I'm going to be hitting at melee range, they're going to be kiting/running. All I need is an extra swing or a chance to proc imp hamstring during the melee exchange.
---

Bought this on Amazon back in January and it was worth every penny. I've never been so comfortable sitting up before. The supports are amazing and encourage good posture as well.
---
My claim? No, my claim is that I've played original vanilla, and I've played private servers with a 3k pop. Vanilla had WAY more players. So uh yeah, that's my claim
---
Yea I see
---
I sure fucking hope so.
---
Oh so you're just on the hate train. I fucking hate Apple but jesus christ bud.
---
My name is Stunna i played on illidan i was part of the guild -Midnight Raiders- if any old school players are gonna play id like to link up!
---
u don't say.
---
The only thing that's unethical is the warranty company banking on the fact that people will forget they never purchased the warranty in the first place.
---
so tense. you should relax :p the horde got your panties in a bunch.
---
This is fair lol when I leveled my mage it was early 2005 so I had no idea
---
Tick rate or start up time ? on that totem is pretty slow in vanilla if i remember right
---
Lol I always thought this was the coolest encounter.
---
That sucks, really evil, I would be so distraught if I were you.   
---
The worst part is that they have the man power to track a  bug that flag people for the beta wrongly and would rather cancel it than be generous and say well our bad you are in.   
---
Unless it was insanely massive, it really make you wonder what they are so afraid of. Why not letting people not meeting their obscure criteria to be flagged  to be in the beta nonetheless.
---
What about the lead developer of the game saying that it had 3k? Is that not proof enough for you?
---
Gotta say I wish I could choose multiple
---
thats cool
---
Was levelling Durotar. There were some voodoo healers, which I couldn't interrupt, so it took some longer, but nothing impossible.
---
Never once levelled in Mulgor in my entire life though, so that sounds like a tough nut, yeah!
---
https://i.imgur.com/1yWuCO0.jpg

I may still have some in my moms fridge from when they were on discount at Walmart back in the day lol.
---
No dude you don't understand.  It swivels really smoothly.  Like you don't even get it.  It's smooth.  Like, you can adjust it easily.  It's smooth.  You can move it round and round.  It's easy to adjust.  You can spin it 360 degrees with one finger.  It's very smooth.
---
I appreciate your replay. I consider myself as an old veteran warlock class as one of the most under-appreciated classes back in the day.
---
I have a feeling Warlocks will be way more popular this time around
---
If you don't have prior experience with classic warriors, it's probably not going to be smooth. Warrior solo leveling can be smooth if you're real good at keeping up with your gear (mainly by running dungeons frequently) and that might be hard depending on your familiarity.
---
Enhancement shaman is a pretty safe bet for a smooth experience.
---
Given that you actually have the Succubus out when you get engaged, the paladin will just dispel the seduce. Also she's very squishy and even the paladin can do a good amount of damage against her with Exorcism.
---
Thunderbluff is the prettiest, iron Forge looks the coolest, undercity gives the most badass vibes, stormwind feels grandious and cozy and darnassus just kinds looks meh tbh.
---
Same, I'm gonna practice a level 10 fedex run a few times in case its needed. Its not an optimal way to level, but it can be faster than trying to quest in a crowded area.
---
I hate to break this to you. Or maybe I don't and I'm about to change your whole world boo boo.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=6940
---
Breaks every CC in the game other then fear. Drop it on your boy and no more Ice traps, no more sheeps, no more blinds, no more saps. Just you laughing. As far as fear. You have ole bobby Bubblay. Which is more then every other healer thats not undead.
---
Also never forget about this gem. At absolute must for pvp but, anyone can get. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=4984
---
Hey and snutz
---
It absolutely is content, a gigantic change in content you belligerent buffoon.
---
Hopefully something serious. Seems absurd, but even if the guild matches exactly with my goals and schedule I'm pretty sure I could not join a joke or pun named guild. Maybe something cheery like Cupcake Warriors, but probably not. My guild names since vanilla; judges of the holy, adversary, driven, and integrity.
---
I can check this tonight and report back.
---
Who cares? It’s just beta. These streamers making a competition out of beta are fucking retarded.
---
Blasphemy!
---
Code red is the worst version of mountain dew that's ever existed.
---
Can you post the RnD costs versus projected sales to prove that?
---
As priest I would have to compete with 2 clothers so that is out of window. If I was resto shaman healer then that setup would be decent.
---
Id replace lock for shaman because it gives synergy for rogue.
---
Race choice is killing me. I've always been a min-maxer type, and i've always mainly focused on PVP, but I definitely still want to PvE.
---
Since perception is still pretty useful in PvP (not as good as dwarf/gnome), and I plan on casually raiding.  I think Human it is :/
---
Yeah, they're super boring now.  I usually just skip them.  Plus, most games suck now-a-days anyway.  The best game I've played in the last two years was RE2 and before that KC:D.
---
I know people have reason to believe Blizzard’s team’s aren’t doing what’s in the public’s best interests because of the past years in retail...
---
But the Classic team has been amazing and has had great communication that truely makes me feel like they’re openly communicating with their player base, making me feel valued as a player.
---
Agreed.
---
I remember when resource nodes weren't shared, and trying to perfectly time my click on the ore vein so that I traded swings with another player.
---
More concurrent players is not necessarily a win.
---
I’ve never taken engineering on my paladin, but I bet it would be! You should try it :)
---
It's pvp so it's allowed
---
So many Arcanite Reapers.
---
This is not my screenshot, I saved it to my Photobucket account back in 2005. &lt;Team Ice&gt; played on Illidan, the same server I started on in November 2004, but I only got to level 20 or so.
---
Orgrimmar
---
Humans are bis PVE race and fantastic with Cold Blood/Hemo Swords PVP builds! Do it!
---
You think the graphics are outdated huh? Good thing definitions aren't based on your own interpretation of them. They are very clearly timeless and iconic, it's not even worth arguing over.
---
It’s all opinion, my dude. I’ll argue that the graphics are timeless all day, it’s my opinion. 
---
I don’t think you understand nostalgia. Playing a remastered Spyro isn’t nostalgic. Actually playing the original game, bad graphics and all, is experiencing what you played 20+ years ago as it was, I would say that would be nostalgic. Not whatever you’re ranting about.
---
Umad?
---
Ok well I’ve already offered to prove it to you on the Beta. We can group and you can see for yourself. We can test it with the little armband quest in human starting zone.
---
Inside his head in the book, adult Arthas kills the young version of himself and Ner’zul, so he is truly in control.
---
I'm getting tired of all these Unreal Engine "remastered" videos. Who cares that much about graphics? If this was to become a reality, 80% of the playerbase wouldn't be able to play anymore LOL
---
&gt;Those work for DPS but not tanking as they are mail, and threat matters
---
How do mail gloves reduce threat generation (asking as a question, not rhetorically)?
---
&gt;Moreover, you’ll still be missing the last point needed to get to the “magic” 308
---
Yeah, but one point doesn't seem near so bad if someone wants to pick a different race for the pvp racials and/or aesthetics.  Just personal opinion, I'm not an expert min/maxer or anything
---
That would require you to roll a nelf male though, which ain't an option unless you're named Légolás, never played the game before or is Swifty.
---
Exactly.
---
Going Tank is a terrible idea if you want to heal, for example.
---
Slightly off topic: make sure to watch L.A. Beast drink an authentic ecto-cooler drink box from the 1990s he bought on ebay. 
---
You can thank me later!
---
I wont lie i was very  close to put multyple options.But i just really wanted to see how shamans-paladins  affect the other class populations.And some info about hunters and druids.
---
I have gathered up dozens of polls from private servers and old vanilla class demographics. i promise i will put another poll but it will study and analyse something different, i dont want to put it randomly.
---
The problem happens when its only challenging on M+ and H and normal are left to be farmed with no effort.
---
Concurrent players.
---
Nah many people still drink soda. Get the fuck out of here with your sparkling water.
---
Just checked your post history, sorted by controversial of all time and find one post about WOTLK pre LFD being great with 25 upvotes and the next one is that comment up there. Where are the downvotes?
---
not really since 1.7, orc is op
---
Yeah, I've heard people say that due to Beserking, they're able to generate the most threat early on -- which is technically true, but it doesn't seem significant enough to me.
---
A 10% speed increase on a 1.9 speed weapon only brings it down to 1.71 but the buff only lasts 10sec, so you'd be lucky to get one extra hit before it expires.
---
1.90 ÷ 10 = 5.26 attacks
---
1.71 ÷ 10 = 5.85 attacks
---
Even if you set up your pull to allow your tank to get hurt enough to get the full effect, you only get your weapon speed down to 1.33.
---
1.33 ÷ 10 = 7.52 attacks
---
So you even in an optimal situation, you're looking at ~2.26 extra attacks before your CD expires
---
Nah, the Xmute never goes above 15g and it drops to 10g pretty fast to hen stay here for a while. Later on it converges down to 5g which the long term price for a transmute.
---
Do they need to absolutely match every single color up to 100%?  Most monitors don't.  So that means every single person viewing your piece of media won't be seeing it as you designed.  
---
Doesn't that cancel out the benefits from spending the extra $1100 for a 100%?
---
Diabetes in a bottle
---
Another oneliner. Keep em going. You aren't capable of anything else.
---
No one who plays mythic content considers doing anything else even playing. 
---
The first time I’ll kill Jaina is when I kill her on mythic.
---
Ah, the olde "I don't know what to say now so I'll tell him to calm down" tactic
---
It's a classic,
---
Oldie but goodie.
---
Its kinda cool considering these were the tournament finalists in the beta
---
Holy shit salty edgelord
---
Do you have 40k people that watch you play a video game?  No ?  So you are doing a lot less for them game vs the streamers......
---
It’s easier if you’re going sm/ruin cause it’s a decent raiding spec and a good pvp spec at the same time. But if you’re looking for optimal pve dps then his spec isn’t exactly it. 
---
Mages usually skip a decent amount of pvp talents in their standard pve frost spec.
---
Ya I quit drinking Mt dew about 3 years ago but I'd go back for these flavors at the launch of classic. 😀
---
We’re all not worthy of them. Their presence is 3 gold a minute.
---
testing leveling speed in world compared to dungeon farming is a good thing.
---
Deathwing??
---
So I'm rolling Horde Mage - Warlock almost got the better of me - but seeing mages at work in the Beta has made me fall in love with them all over again.
---
I need help however.
---
Most guides I've seen say go Skinning and Herbalism for gold, then switch into something else - my question is - switch to what, and when? Do I move into tailoring and enchanting (my professions from my first ever mage in 2007 - or is there a better combination?
---
Also if I want to take PvP seriously, do I need Engineering and therefore mining as a must have?
---
All help appreciated friends! 
---
Lok'tar oga!
---
Mad props for such a detailed answer! And really interesting to get some numbers on just how many hours of your life it actually takes to reach such goals.
---
Yeah I remember a bit now that you say that . Good to know, thanks.
---
I expect you to play rogue as you did in TBC, you were a good one as I remember in SSC
---
Crafting my own armor was my favorite part! Whenever my friends who I was leveling with weren’t on I would just farm mats. Once I had my sets I’d have my enchanter friend deck me out.
---
our racials also suck but atleast we get paladins
---
Ah, well if Loot competition is a requirement then the following is the best comp:
---
* Plate Tank - Warrior
---
* Plate/Mail Healer - Paladin or Shaman
---
* Mail DPS - Hunter
---
* Leather DPS - Rogue
---
* Cloth DPS - Mage
---
&gt; because someone in Kara gear is just not going to cut muster in Black Temple
---
isnt that the point? You cant farm T6 if you are at T4. That design would suck. Thats why TBC content was relevant the entire expa.
---
Is it? If you go to a contested area, the other faction can interfere. If you go to a place with high level mobs, the mobs can interfere.
---
Anyway, I don't see why "avoidability" is the standard by which we measure harassment's severity. I know that OP offered it up as a potential standard, but I disagree that it's a benchmark for anything beyond how severe the griefing is (griefing you can take steps to mitigate yourself as a player being, obvoiously, less severe griefing). Seems to come close to victim blaming. There is a level of pragmatic consideration, where one wonders at what point Blizz is needed to step in because a player can't take action to avoid it themselves, but that doesn't mean it has to be baked into the definition of griefing at a fundamental level.
---
I can taste the bitterness.
---
It was -16 within 10 minutes of me posting it.
---
6-6x6= ?
---
There isn't really a way for the community to police same-faction griefing that can be done by level 1 players. Extensive and prolonged same-faction griefing that only serves to annoy other players should be a bannable offense in my opinion. For instance, if a player is just following around another player tagging every mob near them for hours, they should be banned.
---
Yeah, but that isn't online players. Thats players that actively play. If we're talking 3k ONLINE players on average, then yes that's plenty enough. If we're talking 3k players in general, not so much.
---
Yes, I'm squirming over your huge, logical argu--- wait no, you initiated the playground insults, meaning you concede the argument, so I'm gucci.

You can resume wailing into the void now.

holy shit hammer of wrath, that is a spell I haven't seen in a while
---
=loser. Ie. You. Shouldn't you be making your username proud instead of being garbage?
---
I will never NOT answer any demographic poll, xD. i love those.
---
I am not sure about hunters being less, but druids 100% more in ally side.
---
I'll play a  mage.
---
Paladins are a bit hard to swallow with it but locks is easily understandable when you account for pet abilities. Either way that’s the math...
---
YES.
---
Sit in cheeta almost always. Keep moving keep plowing. 
---
Swap to Hawk if killing mob with more HP(boss etc) 
---
Swap to monkey if something is in your melee range. 
---
Number 1 thing that influences leveling time, is the time you spend not getting XP. So the traveling between mobs or zones.  Cut that short - always move toward the next kill - the faster the better,  send your Pet ahead while you finish the mob with the last auto shot.  Kill anything in your path - always.
---
It sounds awesome on paper: "hell yeah, more players means more people to meet!", but it actually takes away from that because the population just devolves into a meaningless mass of players, and it becomes impractical to recognize individual players from the horde—of course, in addition to all the problems of fighting for quest mobs and resources.
---
Worse.. You got punished if you DIDNT do em! I never did the stupid shipyard, and thusly i couldnt earn flight!
---
Yes, that's what he said :)
---
&gt; you initiated the playground insults, meaning you concede the argument, so I'm gucci.
---
From your original comment:
---
&gt; you dense motherfucker. Don't step to me with that weak shit.
---
Ahaha no self-awareness whatsoever. This is too easy!
---
Oh my GAWD you're right. How did I not notice.
---
Shhh this reddit is streamer fanboi youll get downvoted talking against them
---
It actually gives purpose to track humans and beats, instead of having superman xray nameplate vision.
---
Well I’m definitely not gonna try ret raiding because it’s just a meme spec. I’d def be healing raids and PvPing the rest of the time. I just really don’t feel like dealing with the gearing costs and competition that comes from being a fury warrior.
---
i will play alliance and i will always help those in need. I will typically ignore horde unless provoked
---
plus this happened like 5 hours ago
---
What was? Link the comment.
---
That is correct.
---
Seriously though, umad?
---
2.5k doesn't feel dead. That's about what vanilla had back in the day, and it wasn't dead at all.
---
that is not what simple means " easily understood or done; presenting no difficulty."
---
you can see it on the sub too. horde players tend to be more vocal about their faction, and alliance players think they're cool for being nonchalant about it.
---
K. Keep living in fantasy land.
---
Probably why it was permanently added.
---
Its like the McRib of Mtn Dew but with different sponsors every times.
---
Makes it harder to hide behind small objects, inside bushes etc. There's no way to fix all of that.
---
well are you going to roll on a PvP server? Because if you are you definitely should spec shadow, unless you wanna be everyones Bitch. You can heal fine as shadow  in dungeons while leveling btw
---
Well of course, you're drinking the tears of the alliance!
---
I never understood the funeral thing. They wanted to have a RP funeral and that is very touching....but have it in an Ally only zone for the formal funeral part?
---
!RemindMe 82 days
---
You’re god damn right we want it
---
I specifically hate mountain dew, but yes i would buy some.
---
Thanks for this man, pretty much sums up how I feel about warrior
---
That doesn't break immersion as much as the so many different difficulty levels.
---
well im not a big PvP guy myself but I wouldn't dream of rolling on PvE 
---
It just feels more real
---
Faction imbalance can be a real problem but as long as you at least have a decent guild you will be ok, just make a raid and power through to what you need 
---
loot depends on your guild rules of course
---
Couldn't translate "DIE MAGGOT!" using the translator link, sad.
---
just dropped over 300 on the DOTA summer Battlepass i’ll survive. don’t worry about me
---
Nothing might be a bit much you're right. Divine Spirit and FoW are ok talents but are at the bottom of the tree.    
---
Essentially the problem is if you want to kill things with shadow spells, shadow tree is a no-brainer.    
---
If you want to kill things with holy spells and be able to off heal, Holy is the way better tree for that.
---
Can you prove that it has value that is substantial enough to charge $999 for it? You are just trying to pass burden of proof onto others when this isn't exactly something new for apple. Just look at the new mac pro they announced as well, parts come out to about $3100 yet they charge $6k? They always overcharge and always will due to their brand. You can say they know what they are doing and will make money, fine. You cannot, however, argue that this monitor provides any sort of value to justify the price tag.
---
For raiding mage and warlock is pretty equal, always good always needed but most raids will have more mages. Mages are also very likely to be a much higher population of the server. Mages is also much better than warlocks in 5 mans. Hunters are great in MC and decent in BWL after that they start to drop of pretty hard in DPS meters. They are still very much needed for tranq so they will always have a few spots. 
---
As for gameplay in PvE hunters is the only one with any from of skill in it at all. Mage and warlock are both pretty much one button spam. Hunters on the other hand have probably the most skill dependent rotation in vanilla when it comes to PvE. They have to weave thier abilities in between auto attacks and if you want to base information on Pservers they will even have to weave in some melee hits running in and out of melee range to do max dps.
---
1. I don't think it's dumb, as long as you are somewhat able to fight back then pvp servers are quite fun.
---
2. It's possible that one faction is stronger and especially doing phase 2 with ranking but no dungeons, there will be a lot of locking people out of areas, but after that it's not a big deal.
---
3. i mean yeah people will fight for herbs
---
4. Probably yes, it's not that much of a "hardcore server", it's just a good one.
---
5. Same as in pve servers really, pvp servers aren't strictly pvp, it's generally for people that like to do both.
---
Maybe I’m missing someone but It seemed like you were advocating for the removal of respec costs with that post

 VICTORY OR DEATH!
---
Yeah. The two people that stack shadow resist are going to have an easier time.
---
Yeah, 3k total players wouldn't be nearly enough. 3k concurrent is plenty, though. I thought it was obvious that I meant concurrent players, but perhaps I should've been more clear.
---
for sure
---
As a dedicated horde player since day one, I’ve always been jealous of how epic Ironforge is. First time I saw a buddy of mine playing an alliance toon in IF my jaw dropped.
---
&gt; One of the bosses you had to kite dwarves into flame breaths and get a bunch killed
---
That was for an achievement, not hardmode. Activating hardmode caused higher ilvl loot to drop, Razorscale was one of the few bosses in Ulduar that did not have a hardmode loot table.

[Iron Dwarf, Medium Rare](https://wotlk.evowow.com/?achievement=2924)
---
&gt; . Is it griefing, and against the TOS
---
But, as we established, its not. PEople are claiming it is against the ToS because it interupted the experience of 100k. But that 100k is only from people watching a stream.
---
You were right, the basis for "greifing" is difficult to reach with gameplay mechanics. Corpse camping isn't even greifing.
---
So why is interrupting a streamer's event now greifing?
---
&gt;edit: I mean, boil it down and you're saying that Blizzard should and could only intervene if people griefed their community events.
---
No, I'm saying that throughout the history of WoW, it has been DIFFICULT to cross the line of what is and what ISN'T greifing. Everyone here is claiming that interrupting a stream, with more viewers, makes it greifing.
---
I'm saying it doesn't. There is precedent here, as well.

It's classic, aside from leveling while standing on their heads there's no possible way they can make content any more interesting than you already think it is.
---
&gt; I plan on tanking with a warrior and just thought Tauren because 5% stam
---
The problem with the Tauren stam buff is that the vast majority of the time it's of no value whatsoever. It's only going to have an impact on fights that leave you at 5% of your max HP or less.
---
Which, exciting as those encounters are, are pretty rare. It's more common for fights to go south because of mechanics failures or threat issues. And in those cases you typically die fairly quickly.
---
disclaimer : Always play what you want.
---
Seems like you're someone with infinite time on their hands and equates hard to obtain gear as an accomplishment in life. (Probably due to real life lacking accomplishments)
---
So you'd rather everyone that can't raid as hardcore as you not be able to have a chance at some consistent loot because that would diminish the value of the gear you have in your mind and somehow invalidate your superiority in a virtual world.
---
Long story short. You don't want others to succeed in WoW because feeling superior to other "lazy" players in game is the only thing in your life giving you purpose.
---
As other people already pointed out, a Paladin / Warrior duo is pretty much the hard counter to your Priest / Warlock. You can't rely any of your CCs, you can't rely on your dots for damage and then there's a shadow resistance aura on top of that. The warrior will glue himself to your priest and keep Mortal Strike up for the -50% healing and the warlock can't do anything to help him.
---
Don't get discouraged though, everyone has some easier and some harder matchups.
---
Easy is literally a synonym of simple.  So, Yes simple does mean easy.
---
Ooof i am only 60% sure of what to play.Leaning towards Warlock.
---
I wont vote in your poll
---
I remember it being really long, and that was just doing one side.
---
There are Blood Elves in Azshera you kill for a quest.
---
And that one in ratchet that gives you the longest escort quest in goddamn history.
---
I wonder if the Classic team would also take over for the retail team?
---
And anyone i beat is a noob and should probably just uninstall  (⌐■\_■)
---
This is what wow should be but instead they made it a pve game. Oh well.
---
If you account share maybe
---
I came here to do this, cheers for beating me to it.
---
Honestly would say Dwarf due to Stoneform, resist to Frost. Human's spirit is nice and so is stealth detect. Though the stoneform cleanse and the armor bonus from it is very nice.
---
Yep, making friends happened organically because more or less every element of the game was naturally tied to social interaction.
---
Warlock!!
---
Thanks it sounds like ele shaman is the way to go, in terms of leatherworking or blacksmithing, which one do you think is more beneficial?
---
The monitor is, the pc absolutely is not.
---
For the horde!
---
nice! ret pally and rading aq40!
---
Pretty sure esfand respec'd to prot to tank them to aoe grind them faster, with a dedicated mage, and asmon hanging out getting free xp...
---
Sounds like pretty optimal groups.
---
Can't miss those SM quests.
---
Blizzard made them up. Not me.
---
Mythic Guilds are Happy when they get the last boss down on Mythic.

HC Guilds are Happy when they get the last boss down on HC.

I fail to see the problem here.
---
Idk, I’m not very old, older than you, but I feel like time flies by WAY too fast.
---
I wonder when the first Tournament will be and how populated it will be.
---
No they weren't
---
Holy shit this is good.
---
This picture is super ugly with your watermark on the bottom right.
---
There's quite a few of game of thrones references in vanilla. Some of the Devs must of been fans.
---
Hello! So I’m between going shaman for a support/dps leveling ( looking to enjoy the leveling process) or hunter . Not worried about it being easy just more of a fun and balanced play with some viablility to endgame stuff and pvp
---
Disagree on both of those. The person being annoyed can just log out for a bit or switch characters. The person being annoying should have a right to annoy them into quitting the game entirely if they want. 
---
You can community police through reputation. Sure, it may be a level 1 the person plans on deleting, but if it isn't then there goes that person's rep. Also, it's fairly easy to have a dueling tournament somewhere with higher level mobs that will kill the lower player for you. 
---
Even if there is 0 recourse, which there is, it is still better than restricting the community.
---
Going to be rolling a troll hunter for sure come classic. And a Druid. Which side is better for Druid? Horde or alliance ?
---
In a similar vein, level matters, we can finally be the big boys when go back to low level areas instead of everything being scaled up...
---
Few Weeks ago i was 90% sure i would make a shammy.
---
But i've changed my mind and i will roll a troll druid.I really want to see if i manage to find a raid spot as a resto druid
---
Wife here again. Just shut up and do it.
---
You're a really dumb fuck, aren't you?
---
Mage is the 2nd highest DPS next to Warriors in raids, HOWEVER that is only if the raid builds itself and debuffs to allow the Warriors to do that ridiculous damage. Several items and specific set ups are required.
---
In am old fashioned thrown together raid with no big plans. Yes a Mage will usually do more.
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
If you play for xp/hour sure.
---
Hi missing someone but it seemed like you were advocating for the removal of respec costs with that post, I'm dad.
---
Damn, really? For warriors I would think the Herod gear would be great? Even some cath gear is good for tanks like the Aegis
---
LF Eyedrool ! PST for a grand friendship reunion this August
---
The other general fail is not doing the fight fast enough, which again the 5% won’t help
---
Nights Watch has been in the AGoT since 1996.
---
For shaman definitely Leatherworking. Probably Dragonscale Leatherworking.
---
If avoidability is not baked in to the context of the event, then something as simple as not being able to compete for quest mobs because of same faction/opposite faction members in the area is considered griefing. It's not victim blaming in the slightest. "This area is over populated right now." Are these players griefing the affected player? Can that player not just go to another location? Are we actually willing to consider a complaint of this nature?
---
When it comes to what happened on the Beta Server, this player was able to make a level 1 character to hide from persecution. If they really considered the options, they were all level 30 and could have simply gone to southern barrens or some equally deadly place for a level 1 and held the tournament there. I will 100% blame the victims in this case because they didn't put themselves in a position to be successful. The whole ordeal was avoidable and they ALLOWED this player to grief them.
---
Its a 15year old game put the autism away
---
No raid comp will ever feature a shadow priest. They are simply bad and eat up debuff slots. What some guilds do is whats called holy weaving. Which is essentially a healer with shadow weaving and the responsibility to keep it up.
---
Fuck yeah.
---
I'm asking you, is ONE post where you got UPVOTED for bashing LFD your proof that EVERYONE downvotes you for saying THE MOST POPULAR OPINION THERE IS? You whiny wannabe martyr? Get the fuck out of here.
---
not really since you're still on the inferior faction, paladin support is op
---
He mad.
---
Pretty sure that people considered this griefing but ok

It is going faster to my 3 week holiday where i will sell my soul to this old evil that is classic

Why am I not doing that? Because there is that cool thing called basic decency. Might wanna give that a try before spewing your "holier than thou" attitude everywhere.
---
Tauren 5% extra health and war stomp can be a life saver for raids and dungeons. Looks like you aren't going to get a heal in time aoe stun can give that extra second the healer needs to keep you alive.

Plus they look the best in gear.

Nah, not everyone watches twitch.  They already put out commercials for BfA they'll get a lot more people with commercials for Classic.

I've done 1-60 many times, at least four.  Additionally, I'm a pretty competent player.

**Never** have I reached 40 and had money for a mount. It was always 51, 47, or something like that.

My suspicion is that unless you take time out specifically for farming, then you'll end up in my position.

dang gnomes.

You're too stupid to converse with.

Suck a dick and fuck off.

How are you that young and this excited?

I'm 30, days fly by but this release time is still very very slow moving.
---
The High Elves were the first Magi, they taught 100 humans the craft in exchange for helping against the Zul'Aman trolls. These elves later joined the Horde, making the Horde have the original mage claim. And also, there is no lore justification that a Human mage reborn as Forsaken would suddenly forget their craft. The only class Humans can be that Undead cannot is Paladin, and there *are* lore reasons for that.
---
The Burning Legion also corrupted the High Elves and Orcs into Warlocks separately, so lore-wise, both sides would have them.
---
Use the translator mate.
---
Realistically how many people will have cleared Naxx, though? Given how few people cleared it the first time around, and most of that generation now have jobs and families etc.
---
Mama says WoW is the debil.
---
Blizzard needed a way to balance them because of those awful feet.
---
My old alliance side guild would drop raid progression to go camp griefers. Show up mob deep to wreck folks days. We were on an RPPVP server though.
---
We’re 85 days from launch and this is what you’re thinking about. Most people thinking about what they’re gonna play but you’re over here thinking how the game is brought back only to purposely self destruct for retails gain. Step down from what ever platform you have yourself elevated on and join the rest of us because you’re not some special messiah enlightening the masses with this stupid shit.
---
The initial statement is that Apple's price is ridiculous. The burden proof isnt being passed, it's still on the people making the original claim that the price is too much, to prove their claim. 
---
&gt; nothing new for Apple
---
Yea, sure. Expect the monitor is apparently intended to compete with more expensive monitors. When you factor in the stand (which includes their tech) it's still less than the high end monitors it's competing with. If you look at these things in a vacuum ($200 for an X shaped piece of metal), they are batshit insane. With context, maybe not.
---
So *not* technically impossible. And also, you don't *need* to account share, it just makes it a lot easier.
---
I always goes bear form before emoting a /fart on anyone.
---
:D
---
Holy shit, did you forget to take your chill pill?
---
People speed leveled in original wow with the same mobs, using other tactics.  This is not like some ancient egypt tomb.
---
I personally used the zone-out exp boosting trick back in vanilla to boost people from 15-30 or whatever in stockades.
---
That's why I was trying to work through this match up. It's pure theory crafting but I suspect we will run into plenty of paladin/warrior combos or dwarf priest/ warrior. 
---
For the paladin I'm thinking that we should try to separate them. Let the warrior chase me while my warlock bro dots and mana drains the paladin. I will be shadow weaving so I can add a little dmg while trying to kite the warrior. They cant cleanse a curse of exhaustion and I can dispel the blessing of freedom so I should be able to stay away from him for a bit. I imagine that we can drain the paladins mana and get him to blow bubble with our combined silences. Then once hes oom we can kill the warrior. It will come down to how well I can survive a warriors dps. If the warrior switches we can just swap and I can drain mana. 
---
The same for dwarf priest expect we dont have to worry about a bubble and can just drain him
---
More content at the expense of convenience.
---
As someone who transitioned to BT with mostly Kara gear and a couple of items from Tier 5 I think you over estimate early BT progression.
---
We had a tank still in greens for Hyjal and could clear Archimonde.
---
Gear levels were far closer in TBC making only a few “gear” check bosses really an issue.
---
Does it actually sell for that or does the bug only go as far as that?
---
It started in tbc. Fadeleaf is still used for blinding powder in 1.12.
---
You are wrong on all counts, no matter how many misguided streamer fanboys vote for you.
---
The classic speedrun guides were not based on ShitServer data. They are based on the experience, would you believe it, from people who actually played Vanilla.
---
But please, do try to level in dungeons. It will make it that much clearer for guilds looking for early raids that they don't need to bither contacting you =)
---
The only good response to that is.
---
/yes
---
Time only flies faster as you get older because your days are filled with more bullshit. Be it work, bills, kids, obligations etc etc etc.
---
I'm only 31 but it feels like 4 months ago that my 3 year old was born.
---
Spot on about the nonchalant part, never made that connection though
---
To me it is relatively simple - if there is a PvP solution to the problem, then it is not griefing.
---
I would consider the Shaman example briefing though. Water walking was not designed to be used to kill your own faction. The player is doing it simply to cause grief to a player of his own faction which is not right. Water is designed so you can jump into it and a player is changing that for you for the purpose of killing you.
---
No... they aren't very good.
---
Horde still stomps alliance in BGs though 9 times out of 10.
---
Use the search function.
---
I'll leave this small story here because I think it goes a long way to show how modern WoW is designed. 
---
I think the right words here are power junkie. That's what I am. I want to progress my character as much as is in my power. I can't say "screw it, I don't wanna bother with that sh\*t". I also stuck with BfA up until recently. Lots of people flat out just gave up on doing their weekly Islands quest for AP because Islands are awful content and they're definitely not enjoyable. They also gave up on doing anything more than the bare minimum in terms of chores. I didn't. Because I'm a power junkie. Because we were progressing on Mythic for the first time ever and I wanted even that minimal power gain from those few bonus ilvls on the neck and the +5 ilvl on the Azerite pieces. 
---
So I farmed AP. I did all the world quests, all the island weekly quests, all the weekly events, everything. Then I farmed M+ for my best trinkets too because I wanted them in case I could use them depending on my role as  a healer. I grinded and grinded and grinded for nothing. 65k AP per week roughly and anyone who's done the same knows that's quite a lot. I spent so much time doing chores instead of having fun. 
---
And then I hit level 50, which is the cap for neck levels. Suddenly, almost all content is dead to me. I can't get any meaningful upgrades from anything anymore, I can't progress my character through AP, there's nothing. There's no point to me playing, there's nothing for me to do. There's nothing I particularly enjoy either. Okay M+ may be fun but it's too fast and it's tiring and there's no progression outside of raising a third-party score. Heck, I can't even take any pride in my accomplishment because I'm not really ahead of anyone. In a week or two, everyone's gonna be at 50, just like me with a quarter of the effort I put in. 
---
Now, couple that awfully hollow feeling that I was left with with the fact that progressing Mythic Opulence with my guild was an awful pain - taking about 120 attempts. Dealing with all the drama, blame-shifting, mates failing mechanics we've been practicing for weeks, etc. All for minimal power gain and really no glory. The raid sets aesthetically suck, they're not even class-themed anymore and there's no tier sets coming from raids anymore. I can get my best 415 Azerite gear through Titan Residuum too. And the rest of my gear was around 415 ilvl already thanks to warforges, titanforges and weekly m+ chests. So what's the point of putting in so much effort to raid Mythic? I can do LFR, Normal, Heroic. Maybe it's the hardest and best content in the game but the imbalance between rewards and effort is horrific and there's no exclusivity about the raids anymore, you can just do them on an easier difficulty! Even the gear I'd be getting from mythic... there's no point to it. Next major patch that hits, it will be useless and everyone will be able to acquire it with minimal effort. 
---
Seriously, what's the point of even playing this game anymore? Nothing is of value in this game and nothing is really fun. I just quit. The game needs massive changes and restructuring in its systems. Unless they do that, I'm never going back.
---
I mean... this was griefing as well.  
---
But... since it was one faction engaging in pvp with the other faction, there was nothing that the GMs would do; and rightfully so. Nothing was stopped the Horde players from throwing on their gear and engaging in pvp on a pvp server.
---
or Xfire
---
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing people that Apple isn't overpriced garbage.
---
I won't be hearing from you again. Good bye.
---
Did you watch the video, which was the basis for this post? I don't think anything I said was delusional..
---
10% trueshot aura + 232ap + 77str + 77agi for hunter+rogue
---
232ap + 77str + 77agi for ench sham + rogue.
---
So you would lose 10% trueshot aura but gained spirit+stamina+shadow protection buff for party and ability to shackle undead.
---
I would also give 20% damage buff for dps for every fight boss.
---
Thanks for suggestion!
---
I know I probably won't clear Naxx or anything because I'm a filthy casual now with an adult job, but I'd at least like to try to clear some of the earlier raids...and the min-maxxer in me would definitely be a little salty about not having that sword spec when I could have.
---
I actually played Hemo for a short while back at the very very beginning of BC when I was in Highschool.  I had the fist weapon from Karazan. I loved that build.  Is it considered better or worse than a traditional backstab pvp build?  I always thought that was the best build but what do I know? haha
---
This viral marketing shit isn't even trying to hide itself anymore. Pathetic.
---
You need to spend a lot of time learning it, nobody is saying it would instantly be better.
---
Why should I, when you weren't?
---
Strategically, spamming anything would make it difficult for either faction to coordinate via chat.
---
That was always an edgelord 17-year-old douchebag thing to do, and celebrating it was always childish.
---
Jeez, you almost convinced me to roll Horde. Almost.
---
In case you’re serious: this image shows 4 separate examples of model remasters, NOT a before/after comparison
---
Just because he is geared af doesnt meam fury prot is not better at lower gear and consume levels. It's really good TPS as long as you have decent threat pieces. Tier 3 not even close to necessary.
---
Ive played both factions. Horde mostly but Ally all through BFA.
---
I see this a lot. Alliance allies will walk right by me fighting a Horde.
---
Good comeback, off-brand East European shitty Jesus, taking (no) shit for having the most basic, common, popular opinion there is.
---
What's next, gonna take a brave stand and finally be the one that speaks up and says racism is bad? Waiting to see.
---
I suspect Horde will be more popular. Purely based on my experiences in classic on 4 different servers (3 were horde-heavy, one was alliance-favored).
---
Did you add Heroic Strike(Rank X)?
---
Go to an office supply store with 50+ chairs about and try them out. Gaming chairs tend to be garbage.
---
Holy shit what a throwback, I used to listen to this all the time
---
30S DE mats
---
Pretty much the opposite on the private server I'm on. Alliance max levels have nothing better to do than gank lowbies because they suck at actual on-level pvp, and maybe once in a while we'll get a horde 60 to save us levelers.
---
Sorry that tanking comment was two thoughts.  You want the mitigation from plate while tanking.  Secondly, threat mattering means you should care about DPS, so you will want weapon skill.
---
Do shamans have bloodlust?
---
RP PvP servers had the BEST world PvP BY FAR!
---
Player created events every weekend that made random zones turn into warzones. Was so much fun.
---
That’s a rule lol
---
They should've put out Warcraft 3 Reforged before Classic to fill the gap and hype people.
---
My guide covers this in the Talents/Builds page at the bottom, I cover two PVP Builds, Hemo and Backstab.
---
Hemo is better in the early Phases of Classic because Cold Blood Eviscerate will nearly kill every enemy because of the low health pools (Not that much gear is available that early). 
---
Once everyone is geared up with higher health pools in Phase 3-4 onward, Backstab is the better PVP spec.
---
For horde I was planning something more along the lines of undead or orc. My first character in vanilla was an undead warrior so I might remake him or roll with a rogue.
---
Its not meta police.... its dps players wanting to do dmg and play their class. Shield Slam just isnt enougg threat for warrs to spam execute on Vael or warlocks to even use shadow bolt on CD. 
---
DPS in my raid often talk about how bad tanks are and can't hold aggro compared to me. It is because they are prot spec.
---
One normal mode (that is difficult) and one super hard mode (like mythic) is fine imo.
---
The problem is when you completely ruin the worth of seeing a raid by adding an easy mode, and an even easier mode (LFR). If you wanna see the content, put in the effort to get good and geared.
---
Code red is the best version of mountain dew that I've ever had. *shrugs* to each their own.
---
If you're going on a PvP server, might as well make a Horde Druid. Though if PvE, you can at least test out the Alliance side as well. Though both are good, I always liked the Warstomp as a Tauren. Though if you're going to be PvEing the wisp while dead helps a lot.
---
What does cancellable flight path mean?  I'm just trying to figure out how it made robotic animations necessary.
---
Ya, I actually just recently saw that. I understand the decision, but dislike the fact that items will exist in game that are un-obtainable through play.
---
[Horde, PvP] I'm pretty set in my dreams of a warlock. I want something that is fun to level, and is strong in PvP without a mega-grind for gear. I'd like to raid but that will come later, as my main focus will be on PvP. I want to have some great utility and CC, while being able to hold my own in an open world gank scenario, and put out respectable numbers in PvE.
---
I will have an alt that will get leveled with some friends, and for that I was leaning towards: enhance shaman, feral druid, or priest of some sort. They plan to level warrior/hunter, so I want something that can throw heals when needed.
---
i'm going to stick with the r/hydrohomies on this
---
I think the default build is better in most scenarios, unfortunately.

Daily reminder that whataboutism is not a fallacy, it is deflection. You absolutely need to have your own shit in order to call out others.
---
This is a great idea. Need an alliance one too. If nothing else, it looks like alliance will have an absurd amount of warriors and rogues.
---
No, but I did forget to get rid of some annoying posts. A mistake I am going to rectify post-haste.
---
Imagine rolling up to your favorite Herb farming spot and seeing someone from the other faction snipping all your flowers?
---
On a PvE you literally have to watch and wait for them to leave.
---
On PvP you can assert your dominance on your land!
---
Sometimes just being there is enough to make someone say "Ahh not worth fighting for" and leave.
---
Can confirm. Playing no a private server and having 6-slots be valuable a feeling that dwarfs retail where nothing has any sense of meaning or achievement, where level 100+ players fly past you on semi-transparent oversized dragon mounts that they bought with real money or every player, young or old, has some sort of long convoluted title following or preceding their name.
---
It’s supposed to drop at midnight CEST so i plan to reverse my sleeping schedule :( :)
---
That quest chain was awesome. It was the last one I did before going to Outland. I remember having to go to all these obscure places in Azshara and whatnot.
---
Classic you could cancel flight paths by logging out.  This was super helpful for far ones.  I logged out between Org and Xroads a ton, because I'd forget to empty my bags in Org or get my training or whatever else.
---
The more shit you have to do the faster time flies.
---
So OP, looks like you just need to get some hobbies or something else to fill your time.
---
Awesome! Thanks for all the info, at work now but will read through the whole guide later!
---
Out of curiosity, What is the second Alliance Only rep faction?
---
BFA.
---
Yea bro this is just a non-issue reddit neck beards wanna whine about. Every major streamer has already said they plan on playing on the same server. They are all t1 players and will undoubtedly have a lot of clout on that server. If you don't wanna deal with them. Just play on a different server.

And then respecing to shadow at 40. But if you are on a pvp server or want to pvp at all while leveling I would just reccomend leveling as shadow. You will be able to heal dungeons fine as shadow. 
---
In reality you could level to 40 with just https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bVZZxM and not really miss out on much 😂

I just cant put inro words how lazy this statement is

Unrelated but did they change /camp?

Idk, I think it's once you have kids. Still in my 20s, 2 kids, and the weeks fly by. I can hardly remember when my 6 year old was 0-3, and my 3 year old is hard to remember when he was young already. I also find myself wanting the week to fly by because of work (silly me, I work M-F and on call Sat/Sun so I'm never really "off"), but it just makes life fly by so fast.

The Wildhammer Clan.
---
For Mage, race isn’t nearly as big of a deal on Alliance.  If you are talking rogue, that’s a different story as we found out this week that the first 8 bonus weapon skill points are a HUGE DPS gain.
---
Why would sl be banned?
---
Thats retarded. This is classic not bfa
---
Stop bullying the boomers :(
---
Hunters in vanilla were far from monotonous compared to other dps... all of which were/are far simpler than where the classes are now in a dps role.  In fact Hunters probably had the most difficult rotation to master.
---
The trouble with Hunters came from the fact that all that work meant at best you were middle of the pack dps by the time AQ40 and Naxx rolled around.  (You were also brought along for Tranq shot but honestly I forget if that was ever needed in AQ40 or Naxx.)
---
Honestly I'd probably recommend Shaman.  Your totems offer a tremendous amount of versatility and the pairing with your warrior friend would be more harmonious than any of the other classes you mentioned.
---
I really feel like grinding specific mobs with good loot tables from 1-60 is going to get you to max level with the most gold in your pocket and least competition/downtime.
---
I'm sure someone out there has already done the numbers on Grinding vs Questing though.
---
Who hurt you
---
I think the point he is making (albeit, in an aggressive and confrontational way) is that players are conflating their memory regarding the difficulty of the game with their memory regarding their lack of ability in the game.  Even the person he responded to:
---
&gt;Well it seems like it is way easier than we all remember. It has been validated that some boss deals the correct amount of domage. But I'm not quite sure all mobs hit normal, YET.  
---
&gt;I think it is just a wait and see situation
---
Is still hedging that what they are seeing in Classic is not accurate, and implying that this is on Blizzard's end. There is an aura of elitism that is being challenged in WoW Classic, where people who have been arguing FOR YEARS on how tough Vanilla was are basically being told, "you're wrong" and it's not being handled well. Meanwhile, many who didn't hop into Private Servers since then remember that classic was slower, and more tedious, but not necessarily more challenging.
---
Even when you control for experience with MMOs and WoW, the pure amount of resources available today makes it a very different game. Having a Vent server back then was a big deal, but now people can easily hop into Discord for 5 man dungeons and quests. WoWhead, IcyVeins, etc. make the Classic WoW experience fundamentally different from Vanilla.
---
To put it another way, when we played Vanilla, we asked, "how does this work?" because we didn't know. **Now, people have so much knowledge on how everything in the game works, they are flat out accusing BLIZZARD of making Classic wrong.**
---
And despite our lack of tools, despite not being able to min/max our characters, or know the most efficient ways to farm something, despite everything, plenty of people got through it all just fine. That should have been an indicator that maybe Vanilla wasn't all that difficult.
---
The sub doesn't hate streamers. It just doesn't ban neck beards and they get noisy. 99% of people on here have zero opinion on streamers. Keep in mind this sub is up to 100k+ people.
---
You will still be in the dungeon, and able to walk with your group to each group of mobs.
---
Your damage is gonna be *really* bad.
---
Like 75% of that talent tree just makes you &amp; your pet more tanky. 
---
DS/Ruin is a competitive, top tier dps spec that lets you still do demonology stuff outside of dungeons. In dungeons you'll sac your succy and crit hard with shadowbolts.
---

Strange. I don’t recall it ever being implemented outside datamining

Ok, then 10bit color is basically 0bit color compared to high end 12bit displays.
---
I work in color science for film, I have never seen a single pixel go to mastering that was so saturated that it dipped into the widest depths of the P3 gamut.
---
Furthermore, human eyeballs are a terrible tool for final color work anyway. Histograms and vectorscopes are what we use to remove the human factor from color grading...and they don't care if your monitor can display 98% of P3 DCI or 100%.
---
What do you mean SL is banned?
---
Oh super thank you must of missed that part :D 1 more question tough : if you have a auto shot time of 2.9 secs does the white bar take 2.9 sec + the red one like 0.5 (+- this is the hidden cool down on auto shot and multi shot or am I wrong)  or is the white + red together 2.9 secs ? And if let’s say u start your aimed when the white is already in like 1 second in the cast the aimed will land directly after its 3 second directly followed by an auto. Only after these are finished does the 2.9 time start again right ?  So on a 2.9 speed wep I can do the following burst :
---
Auto shot - 3 sec later aimed + auto ( instant or also 0.5 delay ) - multishot 0.5 sec later (multishots hidden delay) 
---
So land 4 shots in 3.5 or 4 secs ? If u would press aimed perfectly at the start of the white bar ?
---
git gud and learn it by yourself lazyass
---
You are right this is classic, hence the ban
---
I think shaman is *nice*, but not necessarily top tier. The only time I'm like "oh hot damn we have a shaman, great" is in ST around the undead who fear (for fear totem, but priest/mage can just dispel, and UD can WotFS) and when I'm in a group with 3-4 melee for windfury. They don't have great CC, they have some decent flexibility with totems, but overall they are meh IMO. The other big thing they bring is reincarnation for wipe recovery.
---
I'd go either rogue/hunter or druid/hunter. Rogue and druid both add CC, rogues with sap and druids with hibernate, and hunter adds ranged dps (huge in dungeons like mara), kiting, high dps while leveling, an off tank, and freeze trap. Ideally with engineering on the hunter or rogue for wipe recovery. Druids bring mark of the wild which is a very solid buff, and most importantly, they bring innervate; which is absolutely ludicrous for healers and can completely eliminate healer downtime if they are geared correctly. Rogues also bring lockpicking, which is great.
---
However, I'd definitely through warlock into the mix even if it brings you to 3 cloth. For that reason I'd probably cut out priest as top healer, just so that you can bring a shaman or druid healer and have mage/lock/hunter or some other combination with rogue thrown in.
---
&gt;I'm going to make my own club with blackjack and hookers
---
actually, forget the club and the blackjack!
---
What about the horde quest that you need to read a few books (that are dispersed through the world) and answer 4 question to a npc? I love that quest, even if the questions were really easy.
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
---
Except this is just a login screen.
---
**BOOTYSWAG**
---
I agree. Your in a world where conflict between horde and alliance is the norm. Not letting the opposing faction into onyixa? Fair game. Killing rp’ers who decided to take their gear off? Somehow not fair game? Doesn’t make any sense to me
---
Up to 40 apparently.
---
In your defence, trying to get the achievements does make the fights more difficult.
---
US Based companies are doing extremely well off the back of the orange twitter addict.  The US economy has been doing phenomenally and he doesn't have anything at all to do with a saturated gaming market.  That's a lore more to do with people having their time taken by mobile games, multiple versions of battle royale, and too many companies competing in the same space.
---
git gud
---
I think thats a bit of a jump, could just be handy dandy PSA. Terrible timing though if it is.
---
Oh i'm on petopia now, i just cannot figure out how I'm supposed to train them. My 34 panther should be able to learn bite, claw etc since it's a level 34 cat but it can't. I plan on taming something else (probably a mountain lion from alterac or badlands because i want prowl) but the SW pet trainer isn't offering skills. I also am curious as to how I'm supposed to get enough training points to get the skills I need as i want to twink at 49.
---
Shamans IMO brought the most utility compared to Druid or Priest (speaking on Horde side). The totems were very handy in PvE, like the earthbind totem for razorgore to kite the adds around. The healing was pretty good, you're pretty much raid healing constantly. I'm just biased because I enjoyed Resto Shaman a lot in Classic but stopped playing it in BC and switched to Priest/Druid then.  
---
They're not that difficult to master, you do have to pay attention a little bit more due to the totem range. Though it is not as great as a pocket healer, if you want to do pocket healer Paladin is the way to go.  
---
Paladins have the best buffs, they're difficult to kill and have an amazing kit. You can save a death run by shielding (I forgot the spell name) a player so they can rez people when the fight resets. They're perfect for single target healing for sure.
---
&gt;  i will roll a troll druid
---
ummm...
---
that's all true, being ranged and facing down a tauren warrior is bad. i'm guessing the tradeoff Blizz sees is that only 1 of the tauren classes is pure melee, so the other 3 tauren classes have to deal with all other melee hitting THEM 2 yards farther away.
---
It's great for dungeons and raids.
---
What's funny is how people keep pointing out that a lot of the Vanilla experience is not dungeons and raids, but in the adventuring and leveling...which is made substantially more difficult by a 'too-high' population.
---
Probably herb is your best bet.
---
Tauren would be "BEST" for herb, but NE is fine too.
---
Reason why I say herbalism as a gathering as a second, is simple. CONSUMABLES ARE FREAKING EXPENSIVE!
---
And bears like elixirs/flasks. Potions, cannot be used in form. (Stupid clumsy paws CANNOT TAKE THE STUPID CORK OUT!)
---
Would be a great birthday present :D 
---
/pray
---
Oh fuck off. "Egregiously disrupting" =/= rolling up to an event and chilling.
---
How many different levels are there?  Normal, Mythic, Mythic+, and more beyond that?
---
hey, gettin rekt a lil too much lately?
---
Any time :) 
---
Enchanting is costly to level and it makes sense to validate that cost further BUT doesn’t have a good return if you don’t get a good spot in line for raid enchants... fair warning :p
---
Trillian.  Get on my level.
---
You mean cuz you can sell that tier 0 toon name, right?
---
You should, because you're a fucking retard.
---
Yeah account details doesn't really have anything to do with beta.
---
You should play what you want. If you want to optimize, orc with axes is best threat unless you're a troll with Edgemaster's Handguards or something else that gives you weaponskill. Troll does indeed have the highest theorethical tps, but it requires you to invest in the weaponskill from elsewhere. There's also a pair of leather gloves in molten core, and a belt from dire maul. Both lock you into daggers for tanking, but daggers are great for tanking anyway.
---
Welcome to Classic balance I guess? That's how it was then, that's how it will be now.
---
Find a pet on Petopia that has the ability, then tame it.
---
So for prowl rank 1 I believe the lvl 32 mountain lions (hulking mountain lion, not sure) in Alterac/hillsbrad have it. So tame one, then use the ability until you learn it.
---
I don't know what is worse. Staring at Trolls feet or looking at Undead knees in pants.
---
Ahh, that buttery smooth 8 frames per second.
---
End game lock has no problem farming lots of mobs at once, they are not bad pre-BWL but they're a bit below mages in terms of raw damage at Molten Core levels (assuming both are equally geared &amp; skilled). 
---
Enchanting is a good way to make money if you get lucky on recipe drops, and you can always supplement with another farming profession like Mining.
---
true, i was looking for some stv pvp but everyone is just grinding inside dungeons when questing is much faster, lame
---
Sure thing pal. :)
---
Threat is more of an issue than being at less than 5% health.  More threat = more DPS for the entire raid.
---
You do
---
&gt; You think the graphics are outdated huh? Good thing definitions aren't based on your own interpretation of them.
---
More like Blizzard decided they were so outdated they went and updated them instead of adding a new race in an expansion. Your argument is seriously stupid.
---
Ferals smash warriors for AOE threat.
---
And also for situations for OT's where warriors can be rage starved, druids do well.
---
As many have said, fearing the warrior would be unreliable at best. If he and the Paladin are close, sure, use the instant priest fear and get them both if the situation is right, but even if he isn't in Berserker stance, the Pally will get him out of it soon enough.
---
I think your best bet would be having the Warlock throw Agony on the Warrior, fear the pally, add whatever other dots he has, then MC the warrior with the dots ticking and try run him off a cliff or into some mobs before the Pally breaks fear and cleanses the Warrior. Meanwhile the lock should be focusing on the Paladin.
---
AFAIK no, the only melee attack that reset the swing timer was Slam, and it had a cast-time.
---
Funny how the person who doesn';t actually have SL is saying that :p
---
It clearly says the servers name.
---
Ohh ok i gotcha, I guess i'm looking at information not specific to vanilla. I was under the false impression that it didn't matter what level the pet originally was and that I'd be able to get the skills as the pet levels with me. I can't believe I've been using this same boar for 30+ levels.. lol. I'll go ahead and tame some wild cats and mess around with it a bit. Need to find one with prowl + claw, if one exists. Is the best way to get training points just increasing it's happiness levels?
---
Should we tell him
---
&gt; Seriously, what's the point of even playing this game anymore? Nothing is of value in this game and nothing is really fun. 
---
Bingo.
---
And that is, in a lot of well written words, the end result of the instant-gratification Theme-Park game philosophy:
---
Because we removed all the WORK players have to invest to get anywhere, and replaced it with lots and lots of frontloaded gratification, players actually looking for an experience where they can invest work and get sloooow but steady results because of it, will burn themselves out quickly.
---
Because, of course at some point, the game has to erect a wall. It can't let you cannot progress past a certain powerlevel. That's not a problem, if that wall is naturally months away, with slow item progression, slow leveling, farming, etc. But it quickly becomes a problem, when there is a pile of rewards and gratification at every corner, to give everyone his daily fix.
---
WoW tried to circumvent that problem with the titanforging system...making loot so random, it's next to impossible to get "the best" anyway. As we all know, that failed spectacularly.
---
But I have good news for you:  
---
You seem to be a player who will definitely go the extra mile and them some to get somewhere. You will feel right at home in classic :-)
---
This is 100% going to be a sort by controversial post
---
Heck yeah they are, there are multiple quest lines where the Forsaken poison farmers and such. Chemical weapons are a violation of human rights and condemned by the Geneva Convention.
---
Vacation already booked.
---
3 weeks off, oh god yes.
---
As others have said the hunter is amazing at soloing content because you have your pocket tank with you and traps let you CC.
---
I wouldn't discount the rogue, though, and would actually recommend it if you want more of a challenge.  Rogues have their own toolkit to handle situations and frankly when you master it (and it *is* harder compared to the Hunter) you just get more of that warm fuzzy feeling.  That and stealth is just cool.
---
Oh snap, checking for more Hearthstone offers/Overwatch League promo material!  SUCCESS!!
---
This would be fun. Totems down and chain heals a blazin'
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
Can’t wait for this to get layered
---
Checked my mail ...
---
Sweet fuck yesssss ....
---
Ubisoft is having an E3 sale!!!!!
---
Ayy, thanks dude. Hopefully, but I'll be playing with some friends that never got to experience the vanilla grind so if one if them wants to play rogue, I dont want to steal their loot.
---
It's "great" for dungeons and raids, but the thing is that you don't need such a high population for easily finding groups. 3k is more than enough for that. The panic over that is misplaced. 
---
And yeah, like you said, having too many players jeopardizes the bulk of the game, which is of course questing, professions, etc.
---
Shaman is a blast to level, once you get Windfury you feel like a monster when you go off. 
---
If you don't mind building a resto set for PvE casual raiding you'll find a spot, most groups will also bring at least one Enh shaman who knows how to totem twist for the big dps increase for your Melee group.
---
There definitely was a default world chat. I remember it being channel 4. I have no information as to whether it will be in classic but I would assume it will be.
---
With 20 years of internet you still manage to confuse me lol :D Is it possible that this person for real?
---
5 min buff machines*
---
Yes, /join world
---
Also, a massive amount of early cooking recipes require ingredients from westfall and other alliance zones. Horde cooking trainer literally give you recipe only alliance will get.
---
&gt; Is it dumb to roll on a pvp server if you never want to engage combat unless forced to?
---
No. You'll be playing on a higher difficulty setting unavailable to PVEasy players. If you're the kind of gamer that accepts every challenge, then PVP is for you, regardless of your playstyle.
---
&gt; Will one faction being stronger on the server completely lock out the option to do certain dungeons or whatever, like is it that shit camped?
---
Even if the opposite faction is camping a dungeon entrance, you'll eventually get it. Just resurrect on top of the portal and you'll zone in.
---
&gt; Same thing but about resources?
---
If this happens, it will happen regardless of realm type. But on PVP servers, the opposite faction actually has the option to stop it.
---
&gt; Am i underestimating how many casual players there will be on pvp servers?
---
Yes. World PVP is largely considered one of the best and most crucial parts of the full Warcraft experience. Realm statistics puts PVP players well above PVE players and their servers are usually much more balanced.
---
&gt; How does loot distribution work in raids?
---
This entirely depends on the guild and would require a separate discussion.
---
Being on a balanced server matters but the immersion of world PvP is the juice for me.
---
 Riding through a zone with guild mates, seeing a rival guild and suddenly it... is... ON! You can’t get that on a pve server.
---
You will enjoy playing your Japanese fighting games or doing Dark Souls speedruns or playing your FPS of choice at a high level. MMORPGs are medium skill games and it was a mistake to kill the world, the RPG elements, and the immersion to cater to hi-skill gamers.
---
I was thinking something along the lines of "nothing beats a classic"  
---
Show webster's definition of **Classic.**  
---
*- serving as a standard of excellence* ***:*** *of recognized value*   
---
Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song in the background.  
---
Show a clip of *Star Trek*, other classic amazing shows or movies,  
---
An In-and-Out CheeseBurger,  
---
Classic Car clips  
---
Clip of Marlin Monroe  
---
Oldschool Memes,  
---
Some old clips, leeroy, more dots, etc...  
---
And then,   
---
CHUCK FUCKING NORRIS.  
---
"because nothing beats a classic."
---
The answer is not well. Ele needs crit and suffers from mana issues. Part of the way it compensates later is to crit so hard people die before you run outa mana.
---
Enhance will be 100% better because you only need to shock for offense and, let WF do the heavy lifting. Then you still have all your mana for heals and totems.
---
Or an infinite turtle
---
having to key people for BT with a Vashj &amp; Kael like every other week to have them server hop to further progressed guild really sucked though.  Even being a guild that got Kil'Jaeden before the nerf
---
The connection between ㅋㅋㅋ/kekeke in Starcraft and kek being lol in WoW has never been confirmed - But I agree it's a strong probability to be true.
---
I mean it could be a subtle way of hinting but yeah im not convinced
---
That what I originally kind of thought about my account. Cause I was able to log-in to the same email address but it said nothing about any existing Warcraft toons... Its almost like account inception this email existed as an account [pre-battle.net](https://pre-battle.net) client and now I have the same account essentially on [battle.net](https://battle.net) just without that Warcraft account.
---
It's not as good without the audience screaming in awed disbelief.

What I vote for is a loading screen of Chromie winking at me while flipping the bird at BfA.  I can dream.

Snutz and Cdew participated in the highly viewed, community sourced, Classic Beta dueling tourny last weekend.  Snutz was runner up, can't remember where Cdew placed.

Also, can't believe how young Snutz looks in this pic lol
---
Sure thing! Hit me up if you need a server/faction to roll on, you seem like a cool guy, I wouldn’t mind healing you in some raids! We (about 20-25 of my old vanilla friends, and others from along the way) plan to roll horde on a PvP server in NA
---
Holy moly you're making fun of a guy just trying to have some fun lmfao you're the loser here

Big True. Our guild would make patrols events In the zones we were based in. Good times.
---
Warlock.
---
Go watch drakedog's old classic videos. (Yes quite often it's all about 1-shotting people), a ton of it comes down to controlling multiple people at once.
---
As for easy/fun leveling... you have a blueberry punching bag to take your hits, and you can just dot stuff up and pull another.
---
Really? Isn't the file name a time stamp?
---
Big time. Caving to cries from minority players is what made WoW unfun in the first place.
---
Dungeon finder -&gt; Raid Finder -&gt; Warmode, etc. Because inconvenience and having to get better or be social is too much work in an MMO.

---
The last 3 points are debateable and probably depends a bit on content and role (MT vs OT). As OT I am partial towards imp sunder since I often put up many sunders on the mob. If my DPS warriors were using sunder, I wouldn't take it. I would likely take improved heroic strike, improved taunt, or improved revenge. On p server, imp revenge proc is still adding threat even if the boss is immune to stun. So it is great for MT threat. So is imp HS. Imp taunt is nice in ZG for berserker tanking and the tiger three mob  - boss, also useful but not needed for MC annihilators.

Not sure how well it's been updated for Classic yet.

Same. It finally pulled me in (listened 6 mos or so before buying)

That was my first character, though mostly because I was young enough that I thought girls were gross

There’s literally 100s of items and materials worthless and not worth the time for the auction house, that all vendor for less then a silver.

Cool list.

For roguebois, Happyminti's [nerf sap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnww5gc0Kc4) series is fantastic. Starts off at lvl 52 vs lvl60 Horde warriors mostly and the music is slightly less eDgY than most videos of the age.

Most people would shoot themselves before grind in wow classic. Its a very hardcore focused playerbase. Nobody else wants it when games like dota league cs and fortnite exist.

Its slow

Its boring

Its time consuming

Its 15 years old

Its got tons of issues we know about but will get anyway
---
He just said “oh there it is 40”... this subreddit needs to relax lol. Let people enjoy things I promise you’ll be okay. You’re getting more upset at the streamer as if he posted this.
---
If your question is about your alt I would say that elemental shaman fits very well in to that first description. You will be a healer in PvE though but unless you are raiding with min/maxers you can heal just fine as elemental. Enhancement at 60 is about as meme as ret palas if not more IMO, but elemental is boss in PvP.
---
Frankly I'd be looking more at gear distribution than the details of classes. So long as you have tank, heals, and at least one of your dps has solid CC (so a mage, hunter, or lock) you'll be fine in dungeons. However if you stack too much of one gear type, you're gonna have a bad time as good loot rots while everybody fights over the same drops.
---
Fun to level? Shaman is pretty tedious/boring to level *solo*, but if you are grouping while leveling, the totems really can make an impact in groups/duo.
---
As for endgame viability, Shamans have a lot more play (as all healers do) more than hunters. Hunters, yes they are strong, but they come with a lot of drawbacks (deadzone mostly, really hard to kite good melees, and casters will make you go BOOM).
---
but they do lack a taunt...
---
Ohh so you think it's okay to just rub it in my face that classic is right around the corner for you.  
---
P.S. do you feel lucky punk?
---
So you're telling me there's a chance?
---
Still torn between Mage or Priest. I mained a Mage in Vanilla and loved it, but I mained a Priest from BC to retail now. Shadow priest is my favourite aesthetically / lore wise etc. Plus I love being able to heal. 
---
I’ve heard Shadow is useless in PvE at endgame though. I’m happy to heal, but I don’t know if I’d get more value out of just playing Mage in raids. 
---
Are Holy or Disc viable in PvP too?
---
Snutz plays so weird when I watched him, way different than I do. Makes me completely rethink my play style lol
---
&lt;wow&gt;

Guessing this is what he saw. If you google "A song of ice and fire" you get this on the side of your search.

One of my alts will be a troll rogue.  Not sure I'll play him much, but he'll exist.

There's a trinket that makes druids unable to miss taunt. Chill.

What would those important things be? Given that I explicitly said “once Blizzard get[s] the mechanics of 1.13 down”.

Do you mean as a player created chat or are there a proper world chat in Classic? As far as I know player created chats have a limit and the leader can kick players and put password etc and the leader gets passed around when they logoff.
---
Yeah 30 is still too young for me. You could use another 10 years of exp.
---
I still have mine from the first run lol
---
I still have both of these bottled up sitting in my room to this day. Years ago after I moved out my Dad ended up saving them and a bunch of other WoW stuff I had. So glad he did.
---
You realize everyone that said that was referencing a blue post, right?
---
The only time it's completely absurd is tauren vs tauren because both of them having the increased range they're hitting each other from half a galaxy away. Which I mean really isn't going to matter very often.
---
Dude, no. They get spell lock at 36...
---
You can use the same pet all the way to 60, you just can't get new skills for it to learn without first taming other pets that know those skills. Once you've tamed the pet that knows the skill, just fight with it until you get the message that you've learned the skill and release the pet to go get your favorite back from the stable.
---
This is a list of all pet abilities and the monsters in the world that know them: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php
---
Player created chat channels have no limit.
---
Boars can't learn claw, their only damage ability is bite. Cats can learn claw and bite, which is a part of why they are one of the most popular pets; they have +7% damage, OK tankiness, fast attack speed and can learn both bite and claw so they can focus dump very well. 
---
You learn talents from pets by increasing their happiness to max and keeping it there (will use a ton of food, so be ready for that) and having them use their ability. Every time they use it you have a chance to learn the ability; sometimes you'll learn it right away, sometimes it will take 20+ mobs of grinding. Once you learn it, it'll say so in your chat window, or you can check your pet taming window and see if it pops up.
---
You don't get extra points from happiness, you get extra points from loyalty levels. They will also gain 1 point per XP level. Don't waste points on resistances as a heads up, that's something you should save till you need to get something specific for raiding; while leveling, I usually just get armor, growl, powerful unique abilities like charge/screech, and their damage abilities bite/claw.
---
And yet, they don't have Zepps. Which is reason alone to go horde.
---
No seriously, those boats fucking suck. Also their FP's are terrible.
---
And they never get Azuregos. Kazzak is a wash, getting to Ony is a fucking nightmare.
---
They've basically got: Black rock mountain going for them and that's it.
---
It was a default channel just like General, Trade, and Local Defense.
---
I cant eliminate priest because it will be my pvp class.
---
I also dont see priest as bad at all. Next to paladins top healers and much better than druid for sure. Druid got lowest hps.
---
Also with spirit buff + mana tide totem I have very good regen. And I can buff grp with stam. I also give free 20% dps boost for boss fights with my talent. Also shackle undead is extremely nice for scholo/strat. Also I can do good wand damage downing trash much faster.
---
Tank: Druid/Warrior. I pref druid.
---
Dps1: Shaman = defensive totems + Group wipe.
---
Dps2: Mage = CC
---
Dps3: Rogue = CC
---
This is for started grp, not fully geared mc grp.
---
I think people use it more for pvp?  There are bombs you can throw that stun players and can be cast while moving.  And a pet mechanical dragon trinket.  And rocket boots I think?   You're under no obligation to start it if you wanna make money.  But it's an option to switch to later on.  My plan was to level with herbalism+skinning and and then I can always replace skinning later on.
---
I’m speaking in terms of modern textures for walls, axe blades, t2 armors, bushes, kobolds.
---
I don’t want new wire frames just higher resolution textures for all surfaces.
---
They have included some atmospheric textures like water and the sky box, already—I don’t very well need to ask for them if they’re already there, now do I?
---
Troll females are hottest in the game. Unless you're into feet.
---
Tell me of your technique
---
Can I pay you to make me an undead rogue one with Perditions Blade and Core Hound Tooth? :)
---
My man, fighting the good fight. lok'tar ogar
---
Why can Undead Priests weild Holy but Undead can't be Paladins?
---
I guess the "Light" for Paladins and "Holy" for Priests are two different sources?
---
Have a child lol. Time will start going by way too fast ALLLLLLL the time lol
---
What a fucking hypocrite.   
---
I watched Soda stream snipe  Asmongold to (try to) gank him and his raid while they were exploring Caverns of Time and Un’Goro this past weekend.   It didn’t seem to be an issue when he was the one benefiting from it.  
---
If you stream, you’re opening yourself up to griefing, that’s the nature of the platform.  Complaining about it while raking in donations from 10s of thousands of viewers makes you look like a whiny, entitled bitch.
---
30-32 shimmering flats, 32-35 STV, 35-37 Deso, 37-40 STV.
---
I am going to echo this.
---
RShamans are the class you want the most of. Totems are group-wide only, and they have a huge impact.
---
Ank saves you a TON of time, and many times can save the raid night. Walking back to a end boss takes a huge amount of time and can mean the difference between a few more attempts, and callign it early.
---
The problem with SM is all the good loot in GY is on rares so no-one does it. Library just has caster loot so non casters only do it once for the quest. Arm only has warrior/paladin loot so no-one else does it after the quest.
---
Oh shit you're right, that wasn't until TBC.
---
I was able to test more recently, it looks like if you were to cast Eviscerate as your MH is about to swing again, your next MH swing after the Eviscerate cast is queued up and will trigger when the Eviscerate animation finished. As a result of this, there will be 2 quick MH auto attacks happening. There is no lost time between these 2 autos. Seemed odd at first to me since the damage wasn't applied when it should have, but its more animation based.
---
i dont get this meme, can you tell me what the quote and picture has in common ?
---
I think it was the player’s favorite place in game if I’m not mistaken?
---
Pharmaceuticals
---
You know that almost every world first went to horde guilds in classic right? 
---
Race/faction advantages are heavily overestimated by the community, when organization and skill outweigh all of that shit.
---
I am 31 as of last night. I plan on doing a mix of dungeons and quests. Most quests will be to get the quests for the dungeons though. Looking forward to picking up the SM quests and doing them. 
---
I never did the SM groups at 30 like a lot of folks did. When I hit 30 I did a few dungeons then started testing alts and professions. I’m testing what I will actually do when I’m playing at that level range. Not going to do a dungeon that is 5-10 levels higher than me. Im glad people are cause it’s interesting but not for me. 
---
After I hit 40 on my warrior and get my mount I will probably PvP a bit then go back to trying out alts. Having fun on my Priest so will probably pick him back up for a bit.
---
But that can work in reverse also if a mob hits the tank for 50 and the tank is at 10 hp, but the healer throws out a 100hp heal after the hit but in the same batch window the tank will live. I see it like tick eating if you have ever played RuneScape. I have not looked into batching much and could be completely wrong.
---
That's because the Alliance are the baddies.
---
Humans want all other races, even their allies, extinguished. They’re the Nazis.
---
Night Elves are responsible for the planet nearly destroying itself time and time again. They’re the Russians.
---
Dwarves fight amongst themselves and dig shit up they shouldn’t. They’re the Middle East.
---
Gnomes just make cool shit no one thinks is very useful. They’re the Swiss.
---
Orcs just don’t want to be slaves, to demons or anyone else. They’re the African Americans.
---
Trolls just want a home. They’re the Israelis.
---
Tauren just want people to love the planet. They’re the Canadians.
---
Undead just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King. They’re the White Americans.
---
Makes kinda sense. I really want to try to shoot for the hardcore engineering raiding.. buuut if I happen to not be hardcore enough it will smack me in the face.. tough choice. The sane thing to do is herb/alch, buuut... am I sane\`?
---
Haha, that takes me back. Our old guild had something similar. If any member posted a specific emergency distress call in chat we had to drop whatever we were doing and assist in the battle. 
---
By the time some of us traveled half way around the world to get there the battles were usually over but a couple conflicts in front of BRM were some of the most epic battles I still remember to this day. I thought it was annoying at the time but looking back it really improved roleplaying immersion and brought our guild closer together.
---
Just remember, in vanilla, you can't create a character of the opposite faction. So if you're rolling troll hunter, your druid will have to be horde.
---
One layer is still supposed to be like 1 vanilla server's worth of people split across the starting zones. That's still likely to be a few hundred people even in the less popular starting zones.
---
I'm seriously considering a Tauren Hunter. I rarely ever see Tauren  hunters, don't really care about min/max, and I think I would be in the minority therefore making me a special snowflake. Thoughts? 
---
Although, I am torn on female orc due to animations, and looking like a human in armor.
---
Winterspring was the person's favorite zone, that's why they held it there.
---
Decursive won't be allowed in Classic IIRC.  But there are good enough replacements.  Just have your UI set up to see debuffs on raid members and a mouseover macro for the ability.  And it's not like there are too many bosses like that anyhow, based on my recollection as a mage in vanilla.
---
also ive seen alliance players not fighting back when ganked. they just stand still until they die. its pretty weird.
---
Well I guess I could adopt a child until the release date. Thanks for leading me in the right direction. Cheers
---
damnn, gg wp - getgud blizz
---
I agree! Pre transmog, all sorts of odd outfits come along but this set at level 49 worked out. Dreamweave looks alright on  females and although it doesn't match cindercloth pants, it feels a lot less clumsy than robes.
---
I have actually perfect loot distribution:
---
2 cloth: priest+mage
---
2 leather: sham+rogue
---
1 plate: gets all plate + 2 handers + shields but has to sacrifice for 1handed with 2 classes which is fine.
---
Ok. Hold my beer while I go get my feelings hurt.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t a world first, i just said it’s not impressive to do it with the easy tank.
---
"Hey you know that dungeon that's almost universally hated? Let's make the whole game that way. People will love it!"
---
But will you fall and die while continent zoning? That's a true vanilla experience.
---
Team speak and fraps
---
Nope. It tastes like absolute garbage. When I want caffeine, I'll drink coffee made from ground beans.
---
This is not true for phase 1. Mages, warlock and priest share alot of the bis items.
---
I read this while scrolling and though it said love mom at the bottom...
---
I’m not disputing that. The same goes for PvP though.
---
I’m eager to see if it’ll turn out any different now that we’ll be seeing classic launch a second time when everyone knows the meta and raid tactics.
---
The red one was pretty good
---
Hardiness is gonna be far more useful than the tauren hitbox I think.
---
Catsmilk, is that you?
---
&gt; I’ve heard Shadow is useless in PvE at endgame though. I’m happy to heal, but I don’t know if I’d get more value out of just playing Mage in raids.
---
SPriests don't really exist, the amount of gear they need to really be useful is really painful, and you only "really" need an spriest (or a priest with hit cap) for Naxx. (Students on Instructor need to be mind controlled)
---
I would recommend going mage, you will get much more life out of the class, and you will be sought after for groups. (Just be prepared to be a vending machine)
---
&gt; And yet, they don't have Zepps. Which is reason alone to go horde.
---
I'll be a mage so this won't be a big problem for me anyway :P but yeah I agree, what I really like about classic is exactly these inconsistencies. 
---
In current retail wow everyone basically has the same strengths and weaknesses, but in classic each faction, each race and even each class has far more differences. It just adds a specific kind of immersion into your character. You can't do some things other races can do, but you can also do things they can't do!
---
I don’t even know what a pro stand is lol
---
I shouldve clarified better, most comps in later tiers take a spriest or weave, so it is possible to play spriest if you can make some friends
---
Trolls are the best Horde race for tanking THREAT WISE
---
Orcs have Axe Spec which is nice if you plan on always using an axe.
---
In the higher raids threat generation becomes your absolute top priority, this is where Trolls shine.
---
Plus their Regen passive is really nice when you're a tank with a shit ton of max HP.
---
Honestly the difference isn't as clear cut on Horde as it is on Alliance for the best Tank Race. It really depends on how you play.
---
All 4 Horde races make great Warriors in PvP. 
---
In PvE I'd say choose between Orc and Troll. 
---
War stomp and max HP are nice and all but the other racials are more useful IMO.
---
Why would you spend 4 hrs in gnomer? We're you doing a full trash clear or something?
---
I played a male night elf hunter and I fucking hated the bow animation cause they held it sideways instead of all cool like female night elves, but I wasn't about to reroll a character after how long it took me to hit 30+ when I made that discovery.
---
I also didn't unlock the "female characters are cool to play" module in my brain at 11-12 years old until one of our tanks went "dude, would you rather stare at a guy's ass all day, or a girl's?"
---
Definitely true. Horde has such a strong feeling of comradery and brotherhood. 
---
Alliance is more like a bunch of mercenaries where you have to prove yourself. 
---
Horde has your back no matter what from the get go. 
---
Alliance has less of an overall faction cohesion and it’s more nestled into guilds and friends. You prove yourself and the other alliance will stand up for you. 
---
I know where I am going. I’m going home. For the Horde!!!
---
lmao realtalk I'm shocked we haven't had more of them assassinated, especially in the modern era

Children really seem like time traveling machines from what I've gathered from these comments.

Need to add Master of Pain  was a rogue PvP video. If I can find it tonight I will link.
---
Just a beta which you're obviously salty as fuck you didn't get into.
---
What’s anal tho
---
&gt;You seem to be a player who will definitely go the extra mile and them some to get somewhere. You will feel right at home in classic :-)
---
Definitely am! But here's what's absolutely awesome about Classic: I don't need to be a cutting edge raider in a guild going for top ranking in Classic. Challenges are present every step of the way, so even playing 2 hours a day, I can still enjoy that time very much. And that way I'm free to also enjoy my life and focus at other things I want to do besides playing WoW.
---
No, I certainly don't
---
I just think adding more content is impossible. Classic raiding is great because even guilds that have cleared AQ end up raiding MC too, because it’s still relevant. Add higher ilvl gear and more raids, you make MC and all the old 5 mans pretty much irrelevant. Naxx gear is already insanely good. The power creep from adding more raids would be too much. But it’s fun to dream. I’ll take my downvoted now.
---
Some are obv trolls but every now and then you get a few smoothbrains
---
Priest healers have a different stat priority than Mages and Warlocks, even in phase 1 and even without Spell Crit / +Heal dungeon drops.
---
I would buy it. Id never drink it, thats gross, but it looks cool
---
Lets be honest BRD is the most important thing.
---
&gt;Which should lead to the alliance getting pvp geared before horde on the grand scheme of things.
---
That's not how ranking works, and AV gear you can literally get in 1 weekend.
---
Yes, I see your post is just swimming in likes, I'll concede my point then.
---
I've been leveling a shaman on beta and it's been a blast. You hit a sweet spot somewhere around level 16 or 18 where things are dying quickly and you have basically no downtime. You can heal or dps in dungeons and ghost wolf is an awesome mini-mount for free 20 levels before mounts are a thing. 
---
Warlock hits its first power spike at level 14 (insta-corruption) and a second time somewhere in the mid 20s. They're beasts at farming multiple mobs at once, taking on higher level enemies (fear + dots) and generally stomp in world PvP early on because Fear is broken and dots are instant. 
---
Both are awesome, I plan on playing both when classic comes out. 
---
If you like healing, love the feeling of critting while Windfurying in PvP then rock that Shaman life. 
---
If you like dots and doom (as well as being able to summon people to instances while leveling) roll out with that 'lock.
---
I can't speak to warrior but I'd recommend leveling with a buddy because I recall it being a struggle bus (especially early on).
---
Orcs and trolls have the advantage horde side for racials for hunters.
---
Yes tauren hunters DO exist, and actually have a great racial for PVP situations (if you forsee yourself getting deadzoned by melees often which WILL HAPPEN), but blood fury overtakes this because of the damage increase.
---
With that said, if you aren't going for min/maxing, go for fun.
---
Cows are awesome.
---
That's the end goal of you're playing Troll.
---
If you don't think you'll obtain either of these items then play another race.
---
They didnt, thats why I rec’d undead. Desperate prayer on humans isnt good enough to beat wotf
---
You sound like some bfa loving pussy. SL is king so go back to retail
---
Not a huge surprise. Tauren are an unpopular race and nelf are a very popular race.
---
I got into the second stress test and played a pally since I've been leveling a druid... elsewhere. It was extremely overpopulated as to be expected.
---
IIRC it was never much of an issue getting spots in 5-mans, and keeping them, if you're paying attention to your pet and things like that - I didn't play hunter, but I was in plenty of groups with them. I know it's bandied about at meme levels on the sub, but you'll have the character for a long time, play the one with the playstyle you prefer. Or do both and see which one you end up logging onto more, lol. I will say I think frost mage has one of the best pvp toolkits in the game.
---
whats the world record for 1-60 warrior? played time
---
Cdew got 3rd
---
Yeah, they're just gonna add these to the filter so they don't work.
---
New Horde outrage, boycott AV! Keep the alliance high and dry and on farm in WSG. /s
---
I don't think it will have a notable impact on alliance gearing and I think you're overvaluing the gear AV will provide. There are some decent pieces, but nothing gamechanging aside from a hammer that is just slightly better than arcanite reaper.
---
They can't take Omar , he's our true warchief
---
It’s okay it was just a bad shitpost
---
I'm not of any help to reunite you with your friends but I wanted to say that I totally remember Totemcharger, his wife and your guild.  
---
I was a vanilla wow player on Dark Iron too, back in the good ole days.  I can't even count how many times I've subbed and un-subbed over the years but I have never left Dark Iron.  
---
I've played every expansion (minus the latest) and nothing compares to the friendships made during those times.  Our guild was never anything fancy but I had some of the greatest times raiding ZG, MC, BWL, all that fun stuff.  I even have a fancy Swift Zulian Tiger to show for it.
---
Anyways, I hope you find your pals.  I added myself to that link down there too, pretty cool resource, I hope to see a few familiar faces pop up!
---
Does beta actually hold character names ??
---
Posted a link that isn't connected to the sub. Would you like everyone to just post all kinds of crap here?
---

---
There were threat addons, didnt say they were good. But omen was out in probably ~6 months. There were addons day 1 of vanilla
---
Just tell them to go back after the last boss. You've gotta go back for the ring then anyway.
---
Im 23 and every single friend I have owns a MacBook, scratch that - every person I know owns a MacBook.

I hate that they can sell a few hundred dollars worth of hardware for thousands. I built my first PC young to avoid the same BS - but there is a plethora of people ready to buy Apple products
---
Yeah but only if I can trade back on release date
---
Ok you play your way I’ll play mine. You play to maximize efficiency I don’t. Cool?
---
Is enhance any good for PvP? I won't be raiding on my alt at all, probably should have put that in there. It'll be PvP only

People who use the quote above most likely look like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ug2DOoxJ1g&amp;t=444s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ug2DOoxJ1g&amp;t=444s)

I'm a psycho, i already use my ring finger on w.
---
Joana is coming back to play classic WoW and is making an Alliance guide.  He still has the world record and will probably make a new record when classic comes out.
---
Even on pservers there are guys who sit in Redridge all day waiting to defend against the abundance of Horde griefers; since everyone is going to leave the server in 3 months the amount of low level ganking has gone way up.
---
There are people who just care about optimizing their path to progressing for the day, and that would never include stopping to defend a low level zone. I however can't wait to defend some lower level areas.
---
Fun fact, logged to my troll hunter. 11/20 teeth
---
Unbliz like. These were released around TBC if I remember correctly.
---
Why? Its classic wow. Open World PvP and disrupting player events is part of the game

How he responds when he gets called out.
---
Blizzard should announce that they are going to change the requirements for this events.
---
And then they should not change the requirements for the event.
---
This way, no one will stockpile for them (why stock up on stuff you "know" will change) and we still maintain #NoChanges.
---
Ok, like I get that, but you're contradicting yourself. You asked for the *best* 5 man dungeon group, sorry if priest isn't in there but that's just the way the cookie crumbles. A pvp tiered priest isn't going to be as good as other classes. Also, don't bring out garbage like HPS... This isn't a 40 man raid, it's a 5 man dungeon. HPS isn't going to be what wipes you, and higher utility will be way more useful for getting out of *baaaad* situations that otherwise will. I'm aware that we're not talking about geared MC groups, we are talking about 5 man dungeons.
---
Wand damage is minimal at best; if you really wanted to maximize clear speed, you'd be better off going with swingier DPS which absolutely cuts out shaman. At *absolute best* I've managed to do like 8% group damage on my priest, by wanding where possible and throwing SWP on bosses... And that was with 1 hunter doing 40% of the group damage, so that should give you a decent picture of what the other 2 DPS were pulling.
---
Stam buff is also flat worse than just about every other healer buffs... It's ok, and nice to have, but I'd rather have a paladin, shaman totems, or mark from druid any day.
---
Yeah, priest has some positives, and I get that you're trying to see what's optimal *for you*, since you've already decided it, but it's not the most optimal pick for 5 mans. Not by a long shot. You bring good shields and are flexible, sure; and the biggest advantage is that SPriest leveling gear and healing gear are virtually identical (high spirit, high mp5, only thing you need to swap is +spell damage for +healing). But they aren't my #1 pick at all for *best*.
---
I think blood fury is melee only, is it not?
---
Not a bad idea
---
Why?  
---
I mean, if it is trying to make some kind of point, it's totally lost on me.   I just don't get it...
---
I always felt like if a joke needed explaining, it is a shitty joke.  That is probably why I will downvote...
---
Son of Arugal
---
Idk what build he used, it was a long time ago, but a good friend of mine just stomped with some kind of feral set-up in pvp. If you're smart about shifting around and utilizing the whole druid kit, you can be nigh unkillable. IIRC, damage was a little lacking but good druids are very frustrating to fight, especially as a melee.
---
Why is disrupting a player event, in a pvp game, ban worthy. Just kill me, lol
---
Nice, but it looks to be one of those mmos where everyone plays Human, cat person, or loli girl. Not fun.
---
Domo btw. Will you be on burning blade? I talked to repairman he said you guys are doing well.
---
Great job :)
---
&gt;If avoidability is not baked in to the context of the event, then something as simple as not being able to compete for quest mobs because of same faction/opposite faction members in the area is considered griefing.
---
Not sure how this follows?
---
"Avoidability shouldn't be a measure of griefing's seriousness," does not entail that literally anything now becomes griefing. It says the measure of it should be something else.
---
Don't tell them, but I might actually buy their product if they went through with this.
---
Nah. Persuade yourself.
---
uninterrupted questing is faster.
---
having to fight people for mobs and fight the other faction slows it down.
---
I've been leveling a lock on a pserver, and it's been great. Just getting into improved VW and having a blast with it. I haven't tried PvP yet, so I'm not sure how taht will play out.
---
Does a warlock need lots of gear to do well in PvP?
---
What are your thoughts on my alts for leveling and max level PvP only?
---
&gt; Also, what's the most efficient way to get training points? 
---
Your training points are `pet_level * (loyalty_level - 1)` so if you tame a new pet it will have fewer points but will catch up at some point.
---
Rogue does great PvE deeps and if they're good at **not standing in fire** they'll be right up there on the meters. Also you're in a half-sweet spot for drops since you're only competing with Druids for leather.   
---
Weapon drops, naturally, are highly contested by your warrior friends.
---
Oh thought he was going to do something in game.
---
Rogue is the master class... no bias at all.
---
I miss Xfire.
---
You gain ranks by gaining honor and AV is the best BG to farm honor right?
---
or am i still missing something?
---
I had no idea there was a world chat. I remember defense chat and the chat you gained access to at a certain PvP rank.
---
What time do the keys go out for NA.
---
Almost certainly not.  Name reservation will take place 2 weeks prior to launch.
---
good point with the stam, that was the reasoning when i watched the video, and it makes alot of sense.
---
That's what they said last year.
---
You should do a chug video on launch day. Guaranteed 1M+ views.
---
Thanks for the info, appreciate it.
---
Talkin bout the +5% pet damage I believe, that and +25% stun resist
---
Eh, I get it. They constantly have people following them around (from both factions) and its not retail so tag locking mobs is a thing. They go to an area then they get tons of people around them tagging things so they cant do quest or whatever. Kind of their only option to level at a decent pace.
---
plus kodos!
---
And how would you measure it then?
---
So I really want to make a night elf shadow priest, but I have heard people saying that if you are going to make a shadow priest that you should really be undead, since you get their plague + wotf. How important exactly is it to have these abilities?
---
Also, is alliance warlock really that bad in PvP?
---
&gt;•Disrupting raids or players attempting to congregate in game by killing them

**Scat Man intensifies**

Hey I can say that I’m one of socially awkward men.
---
&gt; Top premades from each server suddenly have competition = rivals = drama
---
ah yes, the competition of seeing who dodges first, their rivals that they always dodge, and the drama of everyone else bitching about premades dodging queues
---
That's a Texas sized 10-4
---
All those people always existed. They're just a lot less noticeable in game than they are on Reddit.
---
 Its not faster when you have a ton of people following you tagging all the mobs.
---
Yes but only if it comes to Australia too!

You beat the game with lich king!

I'm sure people have written a lot of words about that but you realise that the actual inspiration for the races and classes are the warcraft games (most of all the last one) and there humans have mages and orcs have shaman, also the undead does *not* have mages.  
---
What are the reason that humans can't be hunters, does that imply that all meat that is consumed in Stormwind is hunted by dwarves? Or is it that Blizzard decided that no race can have more than 6 classes to choose from?
---
I assure you you’re overthinking the difficulty of this dungeon
---
&gt; Be me, alliance rogue
---
&gt; Forget the Horde have Orcs
---
&gt; Re-roll horde rogue
---
&gt; Forget the alliance have humans
---
Nothing is safe
---
Because it wasn't meant to be known ahead of time and it also is the only encounter which does something like this, which means you have to make sure you have the proper "raid personel" right from the start which limits what classes you can actually use if you don't plan on having two raid groups.
---
Situations in MMOs should be doable with common group setups. Having to change your entire setup for single encounters is never great design in a game where every character needs to be build for quite a while by a real person each.
---
Im looking foward to doing UBRS and Strat as respective 10 and 15 mans. I cant wait to do the AQ gates again.
---
They are! It’s ridiculous honestly, it’s like you can easily whirl into the future but the past and present can’t be held onto.
---
Should have /s. 
---
Dude we are commenting on a meme within a gaming subreddit about camping other nerds because we had more time played.
---
I would say that is the epitome of social awkwardness LOL
---
Calling yourself an addict means admitting certain truths to yourself that only you understand.
---
For me it is the walk up to IF and the entrance.  My first character was a Dward and that walk is absolutely magical.
---
Close second would be the Tauren starting area.
---
Solution Proposed: Remove Button
---
Do forum bans really disqualify you from getting into any betas? I have a permanent one and got into the stress test and BFA beta.
---
Always enjoy seeing arthas named in these threads. To think I was pats personal totem bitch and he’s such a household name fills me with pride. And then you got drakedog, world of rogue craft and maydie. Good times.
---
&gt; They have included some atmospheric textures like water and the sky box, already—I don’t very well need to ask for them if they’re already there, now do I?
---
Again, I do not have a psychic link to your brain stem. 
---
When you come in and say, "Man I wish they added better graphics" and I say, "Oh they totally did, like with water effects!" you don't have to turn into a raging asshole about it.
---
Eh, it KG becomes everyones hearth (Kinda a pain)
---
The worst part of being horde is getting to EPL imo, everything else is sick.
---
Being alliance getting to Western continent however...ouch.
---
Ok there incel calm yourself 😂
---
No, for the first raiding Tier it was 8 debuff limit. This obviously had massive implications on raid difficulty (oops, there went Sunder armor dropping off). 
---
When wow came out (patch 1.0) it released with 1.0 itemization, 1.0 class talents, 1.0 raid tuning (which was harder), and 8 debuff slots. It was only much later into Vanilla wow that these were changed to 16 debuff slots, items were rebalanced and buffed so Rogues didn't have spirit on their Tier gear, etc., and class talents/some spells were overhauled resulting in stronger classes. 
---
Now, we are playing 1.0 content that was balanced around the original 1.0 state of itemization/talents/tuning/debuff slots with 1.12 buffs. The result? Classic will be a joke for the first raid tiers, in a way it never was when it was released. Sure, you could say this is Blizzlike in the sense that you COULD do MC/BLW/Ony during patch 1.12, but so what? It wasn't end game content anymore, so it didn't really matter. 
---
What Blizzard should do, is tell the "MUHBLIZZLIKE #NOCHANGES CROWD" to shut up and let the grown ups talk, because what we are getting is MASSIVELY unblizzlike frankenstein mess. There are 3 options: 
---
1. Leave it be and be fine with the first raids being a legit joke/pugable/full cleared the first week by even casuals. 
---
2. Do progressive patching that mirrors Vanilla wow's lifespan/history (Blizzard already said no this, which is smart, cuz it's a ton of work and really stupid). 
---
3. Retune all pre-AQ mobs to account for the character power-creep, adjusting only their stats to result in a blizzlike experience. 
---
This is by FAR the best option, but Blizzard doesn't seem willing to do it cuz the #nochanges crowd is actually, mostly, braindead, and didn't even play Vanilla wow, so they don't even understand that 1.12 tuning on 1.0 content is MASSIVELY unblizzlike. - Most of these goobers only played private 1.12 servers, and pretend they raided MC/BWL/Ony when they were 5 years old - they didn't. People who say "VANILLA WAS ALWAYS EZ" legit do not know what they are talking about. Was it complicated? Of course not. But it was never EASY. Were players worse players back then? Obviously. But don't sit here and tell me a 1.12 server on 1.0 content proves it was easy, that's moronic. 
---
Anyways, /end rant (hope it made sense).
---
Spriest is amazing until the enemies cleanse and use restorative potions. Disc priests cleansing allies, purging enemies while throwing heals Shields and buffs are phenomenal. Obviously, phenomenal healers and desired in everything.
---
Mages are great at everything and desired in PvE.
---
So the thing about druids in classic is....only Tauren and night elf
---
You wont compete in 5 man's for warrior bis gear if you tank, because you can invite whomever you want. However, raiding, you may off tank sometimes (you wont need to respec) but you will be competing with rogues and hunters (maybe druids) for rings/trinkets/weapons. 
---
As paladin, you will heal doing everything, ret isn't too bad in pvp when you get really good gear, however, when you get into a BG, people will expect you to heal, (best pvp healers imo) as people expect warriors to tank. As a pally, you'll also be a dispell/buff bot (every 5 min)
---
This was kind of what I thought  I should be doing. The little DPS gain of hawk is quickly surpassed by the gain in time moving between mobs. 
---
Running any other time is a no brainer of course.
---
1-3 because I didnt take off. The following week however..
---
I too have chosen the cynicism faction.
---
are their alot of axe weapons later? i only raiding in vanilla in a bit of MC and BWL, not very far in.
---
I have a lifetime sub.
---
I had thought it would be given since we are in r/wow lol 😂
---
No, I wouldn't say so. Vanilla was all about figuring stuff out on your own, it was half the fun.
---
There is no way you had a tank in greens for MH. Outlands dungeons and quests would easily supply you with blues or epics not to mention Kara, Gruul, SSC and TK. By the time MH was reached anyone would have been doing heroic 5mans and Kara for ages.
---
Thank you for taking the time to respond to me Nerfalisk, I really appreciate it. 
---
I think I might go with the gathering, gauge gold income and make the switch!
---
What would you par with Engineering? Would you keep a gather proffesion in there to help balance the cost? Or is Eng/Enchanting or Alchemy a good shout?
---
Alliance is better for druid. Would 100% roll the same faction/server as my main though.
---
The Light isn't a god in any sense, just a philosophy. All it takes to wield The Light is sheer willpower and focus.
---
Undead Priests are actually the most hardcore of all Priests. It's much more difficult for them to tap into and is self-destructive. When Undead Priests channel the light, it feels as if their entire bodies are being consumed by fire. And when any Undead is healed by the light, they get a similar painful and cauterizing experience.
---
Forsaken that wield the Light also report a returned sense of touch and smell, as well as a return of happy emotions they previously thought lost.
---
Theoretically, there's no reason an Undead Priest couldn't become a Paladin, but wielding The Light with such fervor would probably rip them apart. And since one of the Paladin tenets is to hate all things related to Undead with a passion, they probably wouldn't have many friends. But the opposite is not true, a Human Paladin could never become Forsaken because they're literally immune to the plague that creates them.
---
My fanboy glasses have been of ever since the day I unsubbed a few years back. Thanks for the quality advice tho.  
---
"Nobody will like X when Y and Z exist!!!" has got to be one of the worst arguments I've ran into yet in this discussion. Not everyone likes the types of games you seem to like (dota, league, fortnite, etc.)   
---
I'll take it a step further and say a good portion of gamers can't stand those games. Particularly those that look to video games as something more than just a quick 20 minute session of bright colors and daily login rewards.  
---
Says a lot about games in 2019 that people are this hyped over a game that came out in 2004, wouldn't you think?
---
&gt; Genuinely laughed at the depth on that CRT monitor.
---
That's one of the slim models too.
---
Here's a thought though. How about having some hard content AND not turn into BfA? Feels like the only thing bottlenecking people for raids are few drops and organizing 40 people for raids. 
---
If Blizz came out and said they'd launch some servers with increased difficulty(hp/damage or maybe introduce new secret spells to bosses) I'd 100% jump on one of them.
---
Yeah I think it just depends where the most dedicated and well organized guilds roll. Since the mechanics are known, I think we’ll see guilds finishing raids severely under geared compared to what we saw the first time around. 
---
Definitely will be interesting to see how the world firsts play out.
---
They are alright for duels especially against casters, they are very gear dependent and rely on rng a lot as well though. Elemental is a much stronger spec. IMO it is one of the best pvp specs in the game, it HS insane burst and great utility. I just went with the other class from warlock that I think fits your first description so if you want to do different things with your alt that's fine.
---
Those aren't Classic though. That's a TBC thing.
---
Agh wish I could. Maybe I can make some cash making bags - since I'll be pvping actively in pretty much pigeonholed into tailoring until after I outgear bloodvine, and engineer for pvp
---
I've also hit 60 at least four times, and each time didn't have the money for the mount haha. I always just assumed I was bad.  
---
On my shaman I just didn't get a mount until 60. But he was mainly a grind-while-watching-TV kind of character.
---
[The Wildhammer Clan.](https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=471/wildhammer-clan)
---
Pre-Reinforcement, Pre-Horde Portal Move, AV is going to be very interesting.
---
Not if they don't change the recipe back to before it contained artificial sweeteners.
---
&gt;I mean... this was griefing as well.
---
No, it wasn't.
---
It was arseholish dickery of the most abysmal degree, and I hope that everyone who participted in this shit came home from school the next day only to find that a freak electrical surge had fried his PC...
---
...but, alas, it wasn't against any of the ingame rules set forth by Blizzard at the time, and not against anything in the TOS.
---
Be outraged about this as much as you want. You have any right to, and ample reason.
---
But stop calling it griefing.
---
&gt;I always felt like if a joke needed explaining, it is a shitty joke.
---
or you know it went over your head...
---
Your feelings will be even more hurt when you get back and find out I drank your beer.
---
&gt; Perfect example. Now imagine it's not a school, but a work function.
---
Example works fine on its own, you don't have to change it. 
---
&gt; But, hey, guess what, you're in group 1, line 2 lunch while the people you need to socialize with are in group 3, line 1.
---
&gt; Sucks, doesn't it?
---
To continue the analogy, it's designed where you can sit in line and sit at the same table with your friends. You just have to call them over to your spot in line. 
---
&gt; This is no different than sharding on retail. It's unwanted. It completely changes the game and changes the dynamic of the classic economy and community.
---
It's either have "layering" to improve player connectivity while still being able to party with friends (you just may not randomly see them walking to town), or have a massive line and not get to play for a couple of days at launch. 
---
But I can tell you don't really understand the difference between the two.
---
That's a community problem, not a game problem.
---
Hi, /u/Vinicam
---
AV is not the best BG for honor, but regardless, the thing you are missing is that the ranks given is based on how much honor you get compared to your own faction, the absolute number does not matter so ally getting more honor won't impact horde ranking one bit.
---
The things you listed are niche nowadays. Those things aren't common in current gaming trends.
---
Maybe it'll be a great break from those trends, but its just as likely that it'll alienate people.
---
He made it pretty clear but I guess this is why you don’t reason with the unreasonable.
---
Dwarf. Theres really no other answer for priests.
---
They would have to delay Classic a year to make  that happen.
---
Better FP in STV which makes 30-45 soooo much better. An actual FP in Badlands. An actual FP in Swamp of Sorrows. An FP that doesn’t suck dick in Feralas. Horde leveling is waaaaay easier.
---
Occams razor says its intentional
---
I have 4 classes that I want to play in Classic. My goal is to get all 4 to 60 eventually, but focus on 2 to get them geared before leveling the other 2. Which order should I level them?
---
Requirements:
---
1. Good at both PVP and in raids
---
2. In-demand (in case I miss a raid night with my guild)
---
3. High skill cap in PVP
---
Classes:
---
* Mage - never leveled one before and interested in frost pvp
---
* Priest - Played one in BC, loved arenas, but not sure I want to heal PVP. Respeccing back and forth is going to cost tons of gold.
---
* Warlock - never leveled this one either - heard they aren't the best for raiding until Naxx
---
* Hunter - leveled one in Vanilla - would be redemption since I was horrible when I last played one
---
I took off for a week just to play wow. I plan on playing 16 hours a day. Allowing for 6 hours of sleep and, two hours for pupper walks and, eating. Gonna follow a super strict schedule. I think that is smarter then just trying to power out mega hours every day.
---
Some of the late game dungeons are genuinely fun to farm, and you'll end up going back to them to help a friend gear up their alts.
---
I think the main draw to running them multiple times is that dungeon gear often lasts 10-15+ levels since it's at such a higher power level than quest rewards / loot drops. It's a nice little personal power spike that feels great to have.
---
&gt; You gain ranks by gaining honor and AV is the best BG to farm honor right?    
---
It varies by realm and circumstances. For example on my Horde won 2/3 ABs and alliance won 5/6 AVs with WSG being a toss up. That's due to the unique demographics on a specific PvE realm. A different realm will have a different focus.    
---
Plus of course then you have premades, and PvE progression, and so on.
---
If they bring these mountain dew versions back could us old timers get a diet version at least? It's just not good to chug full sugar sodas like we used to. Thanks. Lol.
---
Thank you for this list I plan to enjoy these tonight. Are you able to find any hunter videos? I cant seem to recall any myself but im interested.
---
Isn’t the Alliance flavor just Mtn Dew Volt?
---
At the end of the day, it's whatever you like playing. There are good AoE pally builds, though I don't know how gear dependent they are. You'd have to ask someone else, as I have no play time with paladins in classic. If you enjoy paladin, play paladin.
---
I'm fine with that. No game should be for everyone.
---
"Because it wasn't meant to be known ahead of time and it also is the only encounter which does something like this, which means you have to make sure you have the proper "raid personel" right from the start"
---
You argument falls apart with every new raid, you understand that, right? If you opt to take or not take certain classes or specs, it is your decision to deal with those consequences. Some raids require more ranged DPS, some require more melee. Some require more tanks, some can be single tanked. Every single raid is like this...
---
Common group setups change from guild to guild, run to run, raid to raid. Just because one guild prefers to run 2 tanks for an entire raid, maybe another guild is used to runnning 4 and sacrificing DPS. This doesn't seem like poor design, it seems like it goes against what you think a raid should consist of...
---
And  yet we did. 
---
After his main account was banned he got def capped through greens on a new character and was back to tanking before the next reset on Tuesday. I was the Holy Pally/FoL bot for our raids outside of Hyjal and our Trash tank for Hyjal where he MT'd the bosses outside of Archimonde. My prot gear was ALL kara gear. I had nothing beyond Kara for my prot set.
---
Early BT was incredibly easy, most of Hyjal bosses were easy if you had the  DPS outside of Archimonde and that relied on raid coordination for fires  and the ability to not stupid up the tears. I don't think we ran into an issue until Reliquary of Souls and the issue there was that our Rogues were too stupid to know how to Evasion/proximity tank.
---
Uh what?  Paladins are literally the hardest class in the game to CC other than Druid.  Sure at low level maybe not but once that pally has bosac and a trinket you ain’t ccing him for shit, and he’s curing all your ccs on other ppl.
---
People always forget about the power creep. I don’t think the post Naxx crowd realised how fucky boss mechanics need to be when players stats get too high.
---
The Paladin side of things doesn’t sound that bad, I’d rather heal over tanking I think. Especially with the amount of utility that pallys have. I like the idea of tossing out heals and buffs in PvP while still doing some damage. 
---
Warrior honestly just seems like too much of a grind for someone like me who plans to play casually and not get too competitive at top end content. I’d rather be a shitty Paladin that can still dish out utility and heals than a shitty warrior that doesn’t get invited to raids because I’m under geared.
---
Also note that if you do pick Troll, you'll be one of the only 4 on your server most likely ;)
---
I have a group of friends that I'm going to play with but they havent decided on a faction yet. If horde I will 100% go shaman because of the utility and being able to 1v1/1vx while wpvping/gold farming on days that i'm not raiding. If we go alliance however Its a toss up between mage/paladin. Is paladin able to do the same thing a shaman can do? Heal for raids but is there a spec I could go that is good at wpvping that is somewhat equivalent to the ele/resto shaman build? Basically is there a a holy hybrid spec that is good for 1v1's and possible 1vx's scenarios or is paladin only really good for group pvp?
---
You don’t have to be undead. It is really good though. I don’t play alliance but I know dwarf priest is optimal because of fear ward. Also I know that in raids you only ever need 1 shadow priest.
---
Also Gnome warlocks have escape artist, so that’s nice
---
Well you are probably going to lose all your money then
---
Admit you checked your email too after reading this post ! :D
---
Dude....have you heard of wind fury? Literally every horde guild has a MASSIVE DPS advantage from that.
---
Hell no, reforged will release in the end of 2019 without a doubt.
---
They already said they’ll allow you to reserve I think 3 names before launch.
---
Horde flavor with repesado tequila. Nectar of the drunken gods.
---
There wont be any pvp gear at start. You will go fresh to dungeons and yes hps matters because it means how much heal you can do total before you go oom. If you have oh shit situation priest is much better than druid 100% there is no even argument about that. Priest are top tier.
---
I also have utility. Shackle undead + Sheep + Sap. Those last two especially help in dm release so having rogue/mage buddies in friendlist already geared would be very nice. Mage with free 20% dps buff for boss is also nice.
---
So basically we have two choices for horde:
---
1. Resto shaman + Hunter
---
2. Holy priest + Ench Shaman
---
Hunter does better dps than ench shaman and has 10% trueshot aura for rogue and tank. So it is better to go with resto shaman/holy paladin and hunter to clear bit faster.
---
It wasnt maybe clear but what I meant with thread is which is best dps with priest as healer. I have no other choice than get ench shaman because I really want that mana totem for safety reasons. Totems also buff rogue and tank, not much but it counts.
---
So for priest setup this is best because its very safe and you have decent dps. Sham+Rogue synergizes and mage does his own thing.
---
Most current displays will not cover the entire gamut now. But if you’re mastering a film that you expect to be in circulation for years or decades, you’ll want to take into account future prevalence of more capable displays. 
---
And similarly, if what you’re doing is color grading for a film with a $200M budget, and expected revenue north of $1B, then no, that extra $1100 does not merit being anywhere in the decision making process.
---
&gt;too much
---
You were ***THAT GUY***
---
I would disagree and say a large portion of the player base is addicted and experience similar feelings.  Most people cant associate addiction to video games because of the bad connotation it has with drugs.
---
Very cool.
---
So that means Paladins are much more attached to the Light? Or weild the Light in a much more powerful way? Interesting, I guess that makes sense because they use the Light as a weapon moreso than a Priest.
---
They got [this](https://www.amazon.com/MTN-DEW-AMP-GAME-FUEL/dp/B07KHY7TM1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?gclid=CjwKCAjw0N3nBRBvEiwAHMwvNgNTcufy3zWcFb8qKj3Hgne9EJBO2m1-umOXRi_0rJLnjMsCfDpMTRoCnrEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=313666028854&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9018763&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17728898562362212745&amp;hvtargid=kwd-592500932772&amp;hydadcr=4412_9619154&amp;keywords=mountain%2Bdew%2Bamp%2Bgame%2Bfuel&amp;qid=1559771706&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;th=1) recent release.
---
To my knowledge, only spells (like Judgement, which matters for Paladins) should reset the attack timer. Even attacks with cast times like Aimed Shot shouldn't affect your attack time as long as time the cast between attacks (unless Slam works differently than Aimed Shot).
---
Working on expansion servers for those that want them comes to mind.
---
Classic should have a cohesive aesthetic.  I think they already went way too far by allowing all of 7.3.5's effects sliders, as well as the new water effects and such.  That should be all of the aesthetic upgrade you need.
---
That's why Addiction in general and choosing the label addict have different meanings and those meanings are particular to each individual.
---
 !remindme 80 days
---
it's not a problem. Your class is able to do that role (regardless of spec), you have no right to expect to get carried and free loot
---
People wanna bitch about iPhone users but i’m browsing Reddit from a 6S I brought on release - still pristine from day 1. I use it at least an hour a day during travel..
---
This device has given me thousands of hours of use, been reliable when other phones wouldn’t be and I could go on..
---
Its a high upfront cost of course but its not like it doesn’t eventually pay for itself if your not fawning over an upgrade the following year and you don’t constantly break the screen.
---
The backstory was created by the people that made those games. What they say trumps whatever is in the game for mechanical purposes.
---
Of course the mechanical decision to limit each race to 6 classes is why Humans can't be Hunters, but it also makes sense lore-wise.
---
&gt; does that imply that all meat that is consumed in Stormwind is hunted by dwarves?
---
Any class can *hunt* animals for meat, that's not what a Hunter really is. The Alliance Hunters focus on tenets of the Ranger Lords and there's only ever been one Human that was allowed that distinction after extensive training by Sylvanas Windrunner, Nathanos Blightcaller. If anything, the Forsaken have a better claim to being Hunters than Humans do, but in-game the Forsaken are all previous Humans and not previous Elves (with the exception of a few NPCs).
---
Isn’t that what I just said? 
---
&gt; I’m pretty sure spell lock comes at 36 so they’ll have it at 40
---
anyone here or know someone who got in the beta without an active sub (besides streamers and f&amp;f)?   
---
I was subbed til cata and won't be resubbing til days before classic launches and I know they said you had to be subbed to get a beta invite but I have also heard about some people getting in without sub...
---
You lost the ability to pretend this isn't outright fraud when you said:   
---
&gt; I do this about 3 times a year and sell the used chairs for $200 on Craigslist, making a nice little profit     
---
That leaves absolutely no benefit of the doubt.
---
I believe the textures will be from Vanilla.
---
The game play UI (i.e., unit frames, action bars, etc.) is from Vanilla but I'm not sure how much that changed. Except for raid frames. Their opinion on that is basically, the original ones sucked and everyone is going to download an addon to replace them immediately anyway so why not just go with the better ones.
---
The menu UI will be modern.
---
Id put my money the other way lol
---
They said they're "planning" on letting people reserve names.
---
That would be the dumbest thing ever for them to do, and would make no sense
---
Go watch anyone playing the beta or Google it. Answer is extremely available....
---
The ui is a bit different and textures are upgraded, check out a stream or video of the beta, that's how it will probably look like.
---
Level solo as a priest. You’ll spend more time wanding than you spent running laps in Dal. Granted the wanding was productive, it’s still just as mind numbing.
---
Shouldn't it be the other way around? The smelly try-hards are the ones rushing to 60? This movie is so weird I can't remember
---
I have a Steelcase at work. Really great chair, and has a reputation for longevity.
---
I'm going with a sit/stand desk as well. It really helps to stand up for 15 minutes every hour.
---
nope, sugar is the Devil
---
Yes, Paladins have a great reckoning style spec. People figured Paladins were actually slow levelers, and they are until level 32. You get at least 3 points in reckoning and make a /sit macro with seal of light and you can easily mob 4-6 enemies at once and come out with practically full health. For a descriptive guide on this, check out Kargoz's 1-60 Paladin Leveling guide. I don't know too much about Vanilla/Classic Shaman to compare it to the Paladin, but Paladins are very much able to take on quite a bit themselves. You can even solo elite quests using the reckoning build.
---
Just try to lock down a Lava Dredger from Domo's Chest in MC (usually a nexus crystal item anyway) and then obtain the blue pvp set and you'll be set. Then you can mix and match that with T2 once that's available and upgrade your 2h to either Sulfuras or one of the many 2hers available in BWL. Even in original vanilla MC progression most guilds let their paladins have Sulfuras because it's shit for warriors in comparison to easier obtained 2hers. With the right attitude and attendance you could be that Hand of Rag SoC FOR THE LIGHT Mage smasher. Fuck now I want to play Ret.
---
I thought that was Metzen?
---
I like showing my ranged weapon but they removed the quiver and thus it is not displayed any longer.
---
Why are all the streamers just doing SM?
---
Go test the fucking zones, wtf
---
Horde have way better racials tho
---
&gt;Same answer as to how many levels there are. 100? 110? No one really cares anymore. How many expansions are there now? I stopped counting after the Jack Black Panda one.  
---
&gt;/f (For facetious)
---
&gt;  I interact with the chats watch vods like it's one giant sitcom and each of the streamers characters have their own backstories and successes. It really is awesome how the game is going to evolve community wise because of twitch.
---
This part confuses me.Maybe im just too old for games/internet now.
---
jk turns out everyone's sitting in scarlet monastery
---
gotta calculate the time making the group, getting the quests, finishing the quests and the run back to restart.
---
I think we will be playing as a duo sometimes, but power leveling isn't really our thing. We plan to go about it fairly casually until we can afford more time. 
---
Yeah, that's pretty much my point. I don't like doing bgs very often and we're mostly PVE. So I wouldn't benefit too heavily from that aspect.
---
Farm on the mage to find the warrior rampage,duh!
---
It’s not when you’re a twinked lvl 30 in full bis.
---
And most druids will be resto. Why are warriors competing with weapons? Most are fury / arms which is 2h’s and the 1 handers for tanks will be stam
---
Per article, original game fuel came out in 2007 for Halo(3?). I remember drinking it during the TBC days, so it was probably the halo one we remember
---
I wonder if that's related to the bug where warlock pets are losing all of their trained skills.
---
Yes, very few Priests serve The Light with such intensity as a Paladin and none of the ones that do could ever wield Shadow magic. All the first Paladins *were* Priests, they just became even more focused on The Light and learned how not to die in a battle. All Humans start with the same training for the Priesthood and Paladin Order, it's just the ones that especially excel and have a knack for combat that get chosen to become Paladins.
---
I don't really understand this "expensive to level" thought. I hear it all the time though...
---
Almost all the professions have a paired gathering skill, and in the case of enc/tailoring, you're actively gathering just by the nature of playing the game...what exactly is "expensive" about it
---
Just add tbc and subtract flying.
---
I thought rogues would be a lot more popular.
---
You just had to be the snarky replier huh, are you the ??? rogue guy ganking noobies?
---
Ulduar? The one with the cars? Was pretty sure the cars bit alone completely knocked it off anyone's list of favorite dungeons.
---
It's very smooth, the smoothest. Its tremendous, believe me...nobody knows Apple more than me. They tell me, the people at apple, and let me tell you they all ove me there. I've known them for years and they are like, very great people...some of the best people. They tell me, it is so smooth and like very high end.
---
Its my birthday Blizzard....
---
just to condense all the info in here to help you out-
---
to learn new ranks of skills (gore, bite, claw, etc) you must stable your current pet and tame a new beast that has the skill already. Then use that pet until you learn the skill from it (make sure to turn on Autocast for that skill). Then you can abandon the pet, pull your old pet from the stable, and teach it the new skill (provided you have the training points)
---
Training points are earned by increasing the pet's loyalty level (or actual level). You'll have to pick and choose with these - I don't think there's ever a time where you can train all the skills on a pet, all the resistances, and all of the armor/stam buffs. You'll have to decide which resistances are important to you, but keep in mind that respeccing pets is significantly cheaper than respeccing characters, or you can just tame 2 cats (or whatever) and spec them for different content.
---
Ehhh better than getting ganked every five minutes from attention seekers. I see your point though
---
If the raid comp is optimized for melee, they don’t go with wraith of air totem instead, and melee are within 30 yards of the totem.
---
I was just talking about racials though. Talking about paladin vs shaman is a whole other conversation that would involve a bit of math.
---
Fraud requires the intent to deceive others. I'm deceiving no one.
---
It think it might be fine for most things at lowest settings, the game is typically mostly cpu heavy and your i7 should be sufficient.
---
You would lose that money. It would have already been given a release date if it was releasing that soon.
---
Is there a decent spec for rogue that can handle PvE and PvP. Not going to be serious about raiding but I'd like to join my friends when I find the random nights with alot of time.
---
Only timer is the 45 minute Baron run in Undead Sratholme, which was a blast.
---
Once I hit 20, I planned on doing WC a few times until 24, SFK as well... but I forget what level is 'required' for SFK that is generally accepted.
---
Once 30 or so, do SM runs religiously..then once I hit 44 or so, ZF then temple and BRD.
---
Always grind/quest in between the dungeons, especially if they require pre-req quests for the dungeons...and pray you have a good group.
---
you see that's where I differ from everyone else. I think that would be super fun but this game isn't about fun with all you "hardcore" people.
---
Just doing you a favor here... read this guide on how to avoid snake oil.
---
https://www.newfiremedia.com/blog/avoiding-digital-snake-oil
---
True I suppose in that department you are indeed correct the weapon skill outclasses any racial from horde.
---
Sounds like you never leveled in Classic.
---
5 minute mob spawn timer
---
I stand corrected. Never leveled in Azshara cause i mean come on.
---
Also I thought ratchet was a High Elf. Is there quest text to say otherwise?
---
Why is everyone so obsessed with best in slot for arbitrary low levels you will never spend any significant time at?
---
wtf? Their marketing campaign is insane. "I don't like it but I'll still give them my money"
---
I played Tauren female hunter in vanilla. You will be a snowflake and you'll love it. The animations &amp; armors look great, and as a hunter do not underestimate how much war stomp can help you against players in pvp, who try to get in your deadzone!
---
yessir. Then I believe he shoutcasted arena tournaments for a while before moving over to Riot.  Played him once in Arena, completely stomped me XDD
---
There are a couple of things to consider
---
1. Questing  right now is incredibly sub-optimal. Everyone at cap is packed into the      same areas which makes competition fierce and pvp outbreaks common which will      slow down leveling incredibly
---
2. Players      at the cap have a high quality of gear than they normally would which      translated into superior dungeon runs
---
3. A      lot of 30 players cleared out a lot of 30 quests at the cap for gold so      for a lot of them they were in a Quest void which means they needed to find      an optimal place to grind.. which they sure did!
---
4. Quests      can be done solo whereas dungeons require coordinated groups which will      cause a lot of downtime and cause people to get out of sync unless their      schedules are 100% aligned
---
There are a lot of factors that favor dungeons in this particular scenario for the Beta. I don’t know if dungeon grinding would still be more optimal than questing given equal circumstances, but you can’t really use this example to prove that. If anything it might cause a second look at dungeons vs questing, but all current experience has pointed to questing being superior.
---
Not to mention he prob had a bunch of quests finished before the level cap was given. That alone gives a huge boost.
---
So in case OP was still wondering if people were dicks in vanilla... exhibit fuckin A right here.
---
Hah with this setup you wouldn’t need CC just some wind fury procs and the mobs would be deleted.
---
It is getting increasingly interesting how not so popular rogues seem to be so far in the last 2-3 months on demographic polls.
---
It will be interesting tos ee if that trend continues to live
---
Sigh
---
I doubt it. I have a slightly newer MBP (late 2013, i5 2.4 GHz, Iris 5100 1.5 GB graphics) and it ran the stress test perfectly fine on lower settings.
---
Zoomers are annoying.
---
Is ele shaman any good for pve?
---
Does anybody have any idea what they mean if not beta invites?
---
This won't be as easy on live. I am sure some will prefer to the mass chaos, especially streamers, however everyone of these players is in absurd level 30 BiS gear. That makes these dungeons 3000x easier. Don't blame them for doing this in a beta. Probably wont be as reliable for launch.
---
Except when it’s two people, you conveniently drop the motto because you won’t get an easy gank
---
How do I do that?
---
Yep. Unless you are comparing how premades do vs how pugs do or something. Otherwise this is pretty much it.
---
Every single post of his is trying to promote his site. No idea how he hasn't been banned yet.
---
You never had to compete against thousands in one questing area.
---
I’d grab a rogue for your #5 slot to make best use of wind fury.
---
Yes, I would be completely surprised.  It makes no sense
---
For the second, I would say it's likely that bliz releases the list of servers before name reservations.  I'm expecting a month before launch.
---
Ive said elsewhere. The change would be everyone knowing the reagents required. So changing them wouldnt be a change lol
---
&gt; Would anyone be surprised if Blizzard allowed people to log into the characters they reserve 2 weeks before launch and just cap the levels at 5?
---
I would be. They've set a release date. This would functionally change that release date.
---
&gt; Does anyone think we will get access to the server names BEFORE the name reservation dates?
---
Doubtful. This isn't Blizzard's MO. When they opened new realms in the past, they just showed up on the list on the same day they announced it.
---
I'd level the Mage first to be honest. You can easily make the most money on one, cause they aren't very gear dependent early on, can make their own food/water, and you can make quite a bit off Teleporting people around to different cities. 
---
After that any others would be fine. At best, for Hunters, really the main gear dependency for leveling is the bow. Don't think buying a bow off a bowyer vendor is a waste of money either, they can seriously impact your leveling more than anything else. Stagger the bow upgrades every other bow though, don't buy the next best bow everytime.
---
If you go with the priest, leveling Shadow with Wand Specialization will allow you to do pretty much anything just fine. Wanding shit to death was actually completely viable with PW:Shield and a Mind Blast to pull which made downtime practically non-existant for the priest. (Especially with spirit tap)
---
I don't have much info on Locks, I played one in BC but I can definitely say they level fast (Albeit not faster than a Hunter/Druid, but fast). One issue they have a lot of the time is threat management. So watch that if you go with this!
---
Yeah i think pvp server is the way to go for me after reading the replies, i think the downside of getting farmed by some bored ??? dude is outweighed by the immersion pvp server brings.
---
If you were trying to be smart or witty you failed.
---
Please try again.
---
I meant the button was on the minimap still but yeah knew that method.
---
Sorry i meant semi
---
just imagine to see her at the other side of Warsong Gulch
---
They've set an exact time and date and outlined exactly how many characters each account will be allowed.
---
It's happening.
---
Yeah, that comes with reducing the raid count to 25. But oh man, if they can rework the 25 man raids in TBC into 40 man raids when classic is eventually expanded, that would be a dream.
---
You can on the same realm if it's pve or always in a different realm.
---
Oh joy. Now the dark thoughts and conspiracy about how blizzard has singles me out for some strange reason can fully sink in. Now that more and more people are getting in there must be some insane reason my brain will make up for why I didn't get a key.
---
I really hope the “streamer server” is PvE.  I’ve heard of Soda before but this is the first time I’ve listened/watched him. Is he always this much of an entitled douche?
---
If this guy is willing to Black list stream snipers, snipers could get together and make playing on a pvp realm almost impossible for streamers. I don’t think he should toss ideal threats out there because trolls will band together.
---
Tauren i am sorry!
---
&gt;She loved fishing, snow, and pvp 
---
One of my favorite lines from the old wow classics
---
Oh good, no need to shatter your dreams :p
---
Nope, but they are fine enough healers. With 21 points in to resto you will do just fine as a healer in pve but as a dps you are pretty shit.
---
Yep! For those curious, the guy who took the screenshot was the GM of Blood Legion. I believe he was the guy who discovered the gold cap sometime in 2006.^^^[citation ^^^needed]
---
https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1136387339612295175
---
Yeah something is happening folks. Good luck!
---
You ain't even a real player unless you using dial-up my dude
---
You would be wrong.
---
sure rummy
---
Don't you mean SoundBlaster LIVE! ?
---
downloading porn? You sure this isnt from the stone age?
---
Awesome, thank you all so much for the in depth answers. This subreddit is really great. I've forgotten so much about vanilla and have been winging it for 40 levels.
---
its just rumor I have heard 
---
could be total BS
---
Source? I was going to level a prot warrior, but use bandages fo heal 5 mans. You may be ruining my plans.
---
You (Alliance) say Š 3 € € ž 2 Š 1 € and Horde will read n y b b l e n o b   (Nibble nob)
---
Oh it can easily adjust? Definitely worth $1000 then 4Head
---
Appreciate it. It's much less confusing to me now that I understand you don't actually get these skills straight from the trainer.
---
I'm leveling a shaman on a private server at the moment, currently 15 and I kinda like it but just wasn't sure how it would feel later on. I also leveled a lock to 18 and also wasn't sure about it. I think i'll end up picking whichever I like later on during my leveling experience. Which brings me to my next question, how alt friendly was vanilla?
---
That’s dedication
---
&gt; This is what I liked. You had content that gave people different opinions on how to succeed.
---
It seems insane to me that someone would complain about individual bosses having a lore-based difficulty option which allows the raid to do some bosses on hard and some on easy instead of having an arbitrary difficulty selection interface before the raid.
---
If people argue over whether a boss should be done on hard or easy, then having the choice isn't the problem.  If the raid was simply "hard or easy" from the start, the people who want hard would probably leave the guild entirely if the RL always chose easy.  Having a boss-by-boss choice actually kept those people in the guild.
---
My friends and I used to drink whiskey dews in college. Jim beam and it tasted amazing. The hangover was next level though.
---
I've done 1-60 as a main 4 times and I've never NOT had a mount at 40, so I guess it depends on how you play. I've always leveled with all questing, no grinding, and no gathering.
---
Truth be told I've got no idea how, I can't picture a worse way to game now.
---
Back then I had a 15inch CRT so moving to the big 42 inch TV was amazing.
---
Yep. A forum with a bunch of salty tryhards jealous of streamers getting beta invites will surely love asking what other content creators would people like to see float some beta thoughts.
---
I knew what I was getting into, I mean, just look at your own posts hahaha!
---
yeah and winning the super bowl is not impressive if you have good players lol
---
Probably main a dwarf priest as I did back in vanilla however I had a Druid as an alt back then which I got to 59 and never managed to raid with. Am I mad for thinking of going Druid over my usual dwarf priest? 
---
 I can never really remember how many druids we used to have raid with us, if I main one will I find it hard to get into groups/raids, resto spec? I won’t be throwing the hours in like I used to back in the day so won’t get to 60 in any quick time.
---
Does a coordinated effort with multiple guilds across faction lines to blacklist players count for intentionality disrupting the game experience of others too?
---
Well that was unhelpful and pessimistic.
---
You don’t. Let people make their own choices. Just cause you want to play one way doesn’t mean you need to try and force everyone to do the same.
---
Thanks, used your free trial
---
They're tan, so you know they must be expensive.
---
Asmongold reacts to Asmongold reacting to Asmongold reacting….  :)
---
Im going to be playing a lot of different classes and was wondering which specs were the best back then. Im absolutely going to go affliction warlock cause i hear it was pretty crazy and actually rewarding back then for keeping all your DoT's up. Also want to go hunter, but the ammo thing has me sort of leaning away from it. Also you can give basic tips for things back then, where is the best places to level, what are the best money making professions etc... its not that hard.
---
Hate to break it to you but /sit to get crit procs will not work in classic. Reckoning is great though.
---
Most go Fury then respec at 40 for MS
---
Depends on when. There are notorious levels that are painfully slow. Unless you cna safely go into STV on a pvp server 30-33 can be rough Alliance side if you are questing. 38 i believe will also be tough as things start getting super far away. Nothing like a 40 minute run to get 3 or 4 doable quests in a zone. 
---
The answer to these levels: Ogres. Ogres, grinding music and drinks.
---
Who cares, be different! On a dise note, back in TBC we started an all female BE twink guild called Manson's Girls. Best guild ever.
---
if the attunement didn't require a full clear of both t5 raids it wouldn't have been such a big deal but it would take time away from BT before we killed Illidan.
---
We sold gear out of there to fund our raid consumables so we might have done it anyway but it wouldn't have been as urgent.  Just sucked for the entire guild's time to be used as a rung on the ladder.
---
Agreed. The only time I thought Heroics were a good thing was the first four months of TBC, when they were insanely difficult. Back then, they were meant to be part of the T4 progression system, and were tuned accordingly. After that... bleh.
---
I've also always hated raid difficulties. Seeing KJ for the first time in TBC was far more epic than seeing him in Legion.
---
I'd rather stare at a female ass for the better part of a day for the next three years than a male ass.
---
&gt;Hey, I put the /f  
---
&gt;/s
---
Sure. But im kinda fine with it being a little easier. It allows classes and specs that normally wouldnt even be allowed in raids, raid. Like oomkin, ret pally, dps shammy. 
---
It will let a wider playerbase do 'late gane' content. While the hardcore players will get their fun from harder raids like naxx. 
---
It pleases the most amount of people while sticking to mostly vanilla feel. 
---
Im still going to die in crystal lake in human lands to the murlocs. Im still going to die often to defias. Im going to have to go to a trainer ever 2 levels to get new skills. Etc.
---
Blizzard di a survey years ago. As I remember, approximately 25% of males played female character, but only 5% of females played male characters.
---
My numbers may be wrong but the difference was there.
---
Good players do it on hard. Raiders using warrior aren’t good players
---
Griefing is specifically bothering another in a way that can’t be prevented by you.
---
Example being, if they allowed you to polymorph a mob tagged by another player. Someone is trying to farm devilsaur, but you whom is on their same faction just sheeped it constantly. Making it unkillable. They can’t stop you, since you are same faction. This is actionable by Blizzard.
---
However, if someone on the opposite faction is pestering you, the course of action is to fight them. Win or lose, that’s how you handle it. This is non-actionable by Blizzard.
---
What? Play what you want lol and dont give a fuck what your friends play? Why would there be anything wrong with a guy playing a female character?
---
Haha. I’ve always played Horde, but my friend really wants to play a Paladin so I’m biting the bullet, and benching my Shaman for him. I think it’s only fair that he role female with me because I’m really digging Female NE’s animations. It’s a trade off, haha.
---
Diablo style game design elements like having a bunch of progressively harder difficulties for harder loot, is what brought us to where we are now. It completely trivializes the reward you get from anything when you know next week you are going to be grinding for the same piece with +5 ilvl. Having heroic modes added as additional content could be great, but having too many tiers of rewards would dull the excitement of getting good gear in the first place.
---
The pet is immune during bestial wrath..
---
He’s complaining, as a matter of principal, that it’s the wrong model. Period.
---
Played almost exclusively warrior in vanilla (pre-engame), BC (raid tank), and beyond...I enjoy tanking very much. But for classic, I'm not sure I can devote enough time to be a committed raid MT, and I'm questioning how much use I'd get as a pug offtank at endgame, never getting priority gear, etc. My thoughts are that rolling a holy priest would be better suited for a somewhat casual playing adult.
---
What do you think is more needed, healers or thanks? Would I enjoy prot warrior without being a dedicated raid MT?
---
I can’t really listen to these guys anymore. They shit on classic so hard, even in their classic wow oriented episodes. Hyperbole everywhere like saying getting to level 10 takes 10+ hours. The host makes running out of arrows in a raid seem like the end of the world. Misinformation such as “Private server players won’t like classic cause they aren’t willing to pay $15 a month for it”. Like common man, get someone on the show that either has p server experience or is legitimately excited for classic. You’re not exactly doing our community any favors
---
Why does Arthas look so ugly and dried out on this image ? I hope this isn't the official look of him.
---
Not really. Not that I wouldn't enjoy looking at it, but I'd rather that money be spent on improving and balancing Classic as well as being put towards a TBC set of servers, preferably an altered time line with more vanilla-like design than an outright relaunch of TBC. 
---
That would require a writing team, more character designers, animators etc. which Blizzard may not want to spend money on when they can just relaunch the entire game again. They might me more inclined to go that route if they didn't blow a ton on CGI though.
---
I think it's the new Fortnite UI with updated character models from Clash of Clans.
---
&gt; It adds a layer of depth a mystery to a dungeon when there is only one type.
---
And literal depth in something like BRD, where the early part of the dungeon is low 50's and the end is 60.  I'm planning to run it early (and often) to collect pre-raid BiS gear, and it's going to be so satisfying to get further and further as I level and gear up.
---
&gt; I liked that Heroics added a lot of end game to TBC
---
I loved those heroics, especially pre-nerf Magister's Terrace, but I do kind of wish that they would develop an Ulduar-style in-game mechanic for selecting difficulty.  Ticking a box in your UI to make it harder feels so silly compared to how Vanilla did things.
---
Just play modern-wow then? LFR sounds like your jam.
---
Doubtful. It hasn't even hit Beta yet.
---
Yes, I did. That was the vanilla leveling experience we all want to go back for.
---
Aliance warlocks are arguably better at pvp than horde because they don't have to face paladins in BGs. Aliance also don't have shamans to go to for their burst damage so Aliance locks have to put in more work there also.
---
Phase 4: Private servers are working at this exact moment to make their own servers more accurate using the data that is now available to them courtesy of Blizzard.  
---
One thing is always true: Private servers will be there ready to support if Classic goes away. After Classic has lived and died, private servers will be more accurate than they've ever been.
---
For your first character, yeah, getting bigger bags is a very, very good feeling. When you level alts, though, you'll still give them full 14-16 slot bags, depending on your budget. Runecloth bags aren't that expensive.
---
I’m running WoW on a private server on a mid 2010 MBP 2.66Ghz i7 with 8gb and GeForce 330M. It’s not awesome, but very playable.
---
They leveled to 30 and didn't had that kinda of trouble. Even more because the beta servers seems to be low pop anyway.
---
God I'm tired. Read it like Flight Paths, Banking, Auction House and more.
---
I’ve always played male characters since BC, but I’ve been spoiled to WoW’s current animations. It feels so clunky to go back to Classic’s male models. That being said NE females are so badass, but it feels weird. It’s new because for one I’ve never leveled Alliance, and two I’ll be the only one in my group of pals to be rocking boobs.
---
Is a picture of players who played in a Classic WoW dueling tournament related to Classic WoW? I feel like if the answer to that is yes, it just sets such a bad precedent for content on this sub.
---
Haha, Dragonblight EU?
---
Unfortunately im not from AZ, i wish!
---
You never had to go against THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
---
Doesn’t have to be a gaming rig. Buy a laptop as it seems you don’t have one make the argument that your household needs one and yeah you’re an adult who earn his own money. 
---
Anyhow all the best.
---
I am too busy getting hyped up for Classic to worry about something trivial like this :) Good thing about the hype is - we already know its a great thing we are getting!!
---
The player loved that place and fished there all the time.
---
You understand that there are vastly more players than streamers in the beta right?
---
Not a big fan of rogues. I'll definitely do that on an alt that's not associated with my main though. Oh god yes. I'll even top it off by trolling on the forums with a level 1 alt so I don't ruin the reputation of my main. 100%.
---
No. Drink water.
---
Nah, AoE farming is easy without gear. If you're having trouble just switch to a lower level spot for a while.
---
Also: wands from enchanting are stupid OP and BiS for many levels each on casters.
---
That's fair then. Benching a class and faction, yeah the least they can do is be a female for you. Good luck man.
---
So what you’re saying is, I need to find more girls to play with? Done.
---
what is the gameplay defense of killing lowbies repeatedly in town or corpse camping? this is such a dumb distinction to make. the morons who run around lower level leveling spots to repeatedly shitstomp lowbies and corpse camp them are much more disruptive to the game than that dumbass who sat on totems could ever hope to be. people aren't entitled to running some dueling event without disruption the same way i'm not entitled to being able to level in peace. otherwise, going forward, i fully expect gms to patrol low level areas and teleport anyone who disrupts others leveling experience for no gameplay related reason whatsoever.
---
Even though you were mad at me earlier, I will say that if you can level up before phase 2, and generally when everyone else is leveling up, you'll probably avoid the level 60 ganking low levels.
---
Classic, yes. High fructose corn syrup and artificial coloring? No thanks :)
---
Not a guarantee fix for you, but tab targeting is your friend. It’s not ideal in pvp situations since it is kinda easy to tab right past your intended target, but I’ve always found tab to be about the only reasonable way to kill gnomes
---
I play Horde and I still visit Teldrassil.
---
Shadowglen is like a place straight out of my dreams: A park/forest preserve where the borders are just where the hills become too steep.
---
Idk reflect inwards my friend if this is an actual concern for you. Play female if you want to play female.
---
Warlocks and soul shards too, can be such a pain to need to stack so many.
---
no dont were not 12 anymore
---
How many casts of Shadow Word: Pain and Mind Flay can I get off before I oom? If I'm in AV, attacking a choke point, how many players do I get to DoT before I'm useless? How does that compare with mage/warlock? I get Vanilla in general is unforgiving in terms of mana usage, but just how often should I expect to drink in those big group fights?
---
Or instead of random requirements, just put a cap on each item for a week. That way there’s a known minimum (if they let us know this limit) number of weeks until the gates CAN be opened, with the chance it could take longer depending on the server.
---
I know people hate timegating (hell people have complained about the phase progression being unnecessary timegating), but it’d allow for more people/guilds to work and try to get their team more mounts and such. Just my opinion.
---
Definitely. Heroic dungeons were cool in TBC, but once they added raids to that system it was too much.
---
Ulduar hard modes are the only time it was done right.
---
UDEN LO
---
And this guy just asked to have that done to him.
---
He could have just said “I know I’m a visible target and will get stream sniped from time to time, but that’s part of the game.” Instead he threatened people with being blacklisted, he just opened up a can of worms.
---
You forgot to add that 100% of this post is a waste of time
---
Is burning blade gonna be a classic server? I thought it was gonna be all new servers. 
---
Ayy that's good. I was surprised to see so many names I recognized after so many years away.
---
Sure, but not everyone has the beta, and not everyone wanted to waste money on a lottery ticket for access.
---
To be fair, this is him before he becomes Death Knight Arthas, given he's wielding Frostmourne but is still in his Paladin armor. Makes sense he looks sickly.
---
That’s not why we all want to go back. Leveling on launch will be so bad it’s almost worth waiting until a day or 2 after to start. Or try playing a race that less people play and avoid human, orc, or possibly undead.
---
To me, beta is a test run. Sure a lot of things will be different on live, what with the twinking from level caps etc, but relearning and remembering how quests go, where to go etc, is super important for release.
---
Chances are you cant or shouldnt follow a guide or route as everyone will as well. It will be very bottlenecked, and say Teldrassil and Auberdine may be a much better idea than Elewyn and Westfall. Making decisions while leveling will mean a lot for speed, and speed will result in better gear and money making options. It will be a mount easier, maxing easier, gearing at max easier. A lot counts on staying ahead of the curve. The most efficient option given best conditions may be the worst.
---
Knowing leveling speeds at certain break points like this with people bottlenecked by level caps are super important to these decisions, and having the knowledge of this can save you hours or days to hit 60.
---
Yeah it's pretty sad. I've definitely been guilty of it when I was a stupid teenager, so maybe it's just a phase where the retardation is high and there are a lot of them now. At least I hope so.

Ok thanks for the responses!

This is fucking amazing.

Ackchyually \*reseats glasses\* Sylvanas was a High Elf before being taken care of by the Lich King.
---
I have a lot more fun crafting my own gear.
---
It’s definitely harder saving 100g by 40... but I did it once before.
---
Granted, I also expect it to be a year before I ding 60, just like Vanilla. And I didn’t get an epic mount for probably another year on top of that.
---
I’m excited for things to take time and effort to get.
---
Code Red is not the same flavor as red game fuel, and I've never heard of code blue and don't see anything on google about it.
---
Why would a Warlock ever need more than a few Soul Stones while leveling, if any at all?
---
lmao get outta town
---
You're missing out. Blackfathom Deeps is a great instance.
---
Perfect, he's way funnier than I am.

At 300 herbalism, there are still orange herbs that your can fail at picking.

Complete with heartbeat monitor so you can slowly watch your life fade away.
---
Skinning The Beast requires over 300. 305 i think?
---
Good deal, I personally don't care if I'm on a server with streamers. That's just easy hks.
---
Aw, somebody needs their diaper changed!
---
1) Yes, but this is what also makes it fun. Not only do you learn your class more but you engage more in a world with real people.
---
2) No, some high tier resources are more locked to top guild rather than faction, same fac can camp a resource and you cannot change it, they may get help from opposite faction to camp same faction people who want to contest (in turn do the same for them).
---
There is the general progression race thing where an enemy guild camps your main tank to prevent you from raiding for a while, easily fixed by your raid intervening. Only really affects you if you want to go for "firsts" tho.
---
3) See above, scarcity creates value. There are tons of ways, or play auction house, to gain a good amount of gold to buy it from the monopoly. If you are smart in economics you may even earn more than those farmers. I got rich with clam meat.
---
4) Yes, very. But casual=/=like meme specs. Balance druid is horrible, if you want to pvp as druid get used to 11/11/29. You play your entire class, not one small aspect. Even in PvE balance druid is horrible, you can play it once ZG hits but you are completely useless. Regardless, if you want to play dungeons casually etc balance works but you will likely not get into raiding. Maybe healing duty in a casual guild that has little time to raid, balance can heal in t1-t2 content. After that, god no.
---
5) Few items per boss, 40people. As a druid you compete with priests and pala/shaman (cloth healing gear, leather healing is rarer and you get it easily) but few druids per raid, easy tier sets if you want to use em (not optimal, but still not bad). Depending on the guild there is dkp, loot council or something else.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
Two favorites right now are Orc Warrior and Troll Priest. I love playing warriors but everything I see is about warriors is about how you have to no life to do anything with them, and I'm not necessarily the most hardcore player out there. My compromise might be to level my warrior when I'm playing with my buddies to make leveling easier, and whenever I'm playing solo, level a priest. Is this too ambitious?
---
The most played race on Horde is going to be Orc by far.
---
Also, this "prediction" would mean ~49% of the Horde is a rogue. That's definitely not going to happen.
---
Well shit.. just looked it up and you're right. That's going to put a bit of damper on that build then.
---
AoE farming is part of the leveling experience. You're killing stuff and you're doing it in a group. Sounds pretty alive to me.
---
I see this BIS list (and others) show that during Phase3 Raid gearing the T2 shoulders is chosen over the T1 shoulders. If I just compare the stats I view Nightslayer to have better shoulders than Bloodfang; is the choice of T2&gt;T1 shoulders based on the 8-piece set bonus?
---
At the moment the servers go live, about an hour.  It'll be pretty late here in the UK, and the server will be congested as hell too.  I'll put off my real time investment a little bit.
---
I tried that stuff they call game fuel but it sucks. It has sucralose too which is disgusting
---
It's really not much of a stretch. Before 2.1, well-itemized blues were better than T5 epics. Post-2.1, when Black Temple was added, blues stayed the same but the T5 epics were buffed considerably.
---
Hyjal was in the game pre-2.1. Assuming it was balanced around people in T5 gear, then people in blues and greens were more than capable of clearing it.

Probably best trailer for Classic WoW.

yeah.... every top guild are filled bad players
---
Do you happen to have actual numbers representing the DPS gain from Human Sword Specialization? I've seen several sources say it's a "significant" gain, but I haven't ever seen actual numbers tied to that. I'm not doubting it, I'd just like to be able to see the numerical difference that trait alone gives humans over other races when using swords.
---
Yeah it makes sense but it wont if hero Arthas in WC3 remastered is like that too.
---
It's not quite the same. Something taste off about the newer ones.
---
Instead of wiping get gud
---
I don't think so. The majority of the player base are not going to pick faction, race and profession based on such relatively small advantages.
---
Yes I need these back in my life. This time I would actually save two bottles for collection
---
Over 300 no. But i means you get 10 free levels before you hit 300. So you can craft stuff before you actually hit that number.
---
I cant wait to get progressivley better and better and BRD
---
I love thay such a seemingly leveling type dungeon has so much preraid bis and otherwise all round reall good gear. And a lot of other pattern drops
---
Yes, absolutely, it’s for the 8 piece set bonus
---
o i didnt realize u liked gettin rekt, guess theres no such thing as too much
---
Streamers aren’t the only ones leveling.
---
...have you read forums before? Ulduar is held up as one of the best raids in wow history
---
Which is funny when you consider that warranties in themselves are usually bullshit that paying extra for them is seen as a waste.
---
This is covered in the Stats page of the guide, under Hit Rating.
---
&gt; A lot of your previous posting has been orientated around pointing out how much more difficult modern is compared to classic
---
That's because the poster I was talking to was saying, and I quote, 
---
&gt; "The complaint about transmogging really only comes about because of expansions, and being able to go back on a high level character and farm low level content. It's a valid complaint, because it's not really "earned" in a sense of more danger / higher reward. There isn't a danger on transmog runs."
---
He doesn't describe what "earned" means. Objectively speaking, as in factually speaking, Classic content was not harder compared to most raids in expansions that came after it. Fact. So I was asking him where this idea of "I earned it" came from and the only answer I've seem to come up with is the "time spent = value theory". "I spent time doing this, therefore I give it value."
---
&gt; so that is why I assumed that this is one of your primary reasons for believing that modern is so superior. 
---
Objectively speaking, as in factually speaking, Classic content is a worse iteration of the game compared to almost any expansion that came after. 
---
Seriously pick a category, any category, and I can show you exactly what I mean.
---
&gt; So you talk about opinion and fact so much, but you don't seem to understand what it means? You aren't going to find 'factual' evidence for why someone prefers classic or BFA, because preference is opinion. Period. Any attributes you give to either game as being positive or negative are entirely subject to opinion
---
To be more clear, I see plenty of posts where players definitively say that "X part of classic is better than retail". I came at it from the position that they'd actually have some kind of reasoning or proof that it was aside from, "Well it's just my opinion." Which apparently is all I have seen so far. Which is really my mistake. When someone makes such a bold claim, they usually have some kind of argument or proof aside from "That's what I ***feel***."
---
&gt; But as you were wondering, the main reason why I prefer classic is because the forced grouping and lack of Sharding/crossrealm makes a more immersive experience for me due to communicating with other players on a regular basis, working with others while questing, and feeling less like a solo game as a result. 
---
See this makes more sense as an argument, more so than arguments I've seen from other posters. 
---
But yea, the reason they took out "forced communication" was that those quests made sense during the first couple of months of release - where zones were super populated and getting a group was somewhat easy. 
---
They took it out when they noticed that people were just skipping group quests because it was too difficult to get a group because no one was in the zone / didn't want to help / already did it. 
---
&gt; I get it is indeed forced, but people will always take the path of least resistance, and I don't believe that it is good game design to streamline multiplayer to the point where it isn't necessary at all outside of the very end game progression.
---
One of the big problems that retail had that took them awhile to "fix" was mobs scaling with level. Retail currently has it to where zones scale with your level and you can actually group with other players and not lose out on XP or items because of scaling. It arguably increases communication and encourages the game to not be a solo one as a result. 
---
How many times in Classic did a friend ask you to help them or level with them and they were 10-20 levels apart from you? It happened to me all the time in Classic. "Oh, I can't really help you. I don't have any toons your level."
---
You also imply that "streamlining multiplayer" is purely a design choice and not a reaction to a changing player base or changing player behavior. What do you do as a developer if ***no one*** does the group quest you made? You can get on retail, right now, and level efficiently and effectively with another player no matter their level or gear (there are some exceptions of course). You could be level 40, and they could be level 20. You can both go into Westfall and level there without issue. 
---
&gt; Again, 'best' is an opinion based on perception, so it cannot be objectively untrue. Please learn the difference if you are going try to debate logic on the Internet, for your own sake. People will tear you to shreds for junior mistakes like that;
---
My mistake was trying to find reason with people's opinions. An opinion can't really be argued with, but other posters open themselves up to criticism when they say that a certain feature is better, which again, is objectively not true in most cases with Classic. 
---
&gt; For the obvious and clear reasons stated above, I absolutely beg to differ. In fact, based on other comments of yours in this thread, I'm not entirely convinced you understand what those words even mean at this point.
---
So snarky! My only mistake was thinking anyone had any kind of real reason other than, "That's just my opinion." Much like how a religious argument always devolves into, "You just have to have faith."
---
&gt; It sounds more like you've just come here to shit on classic, and use words such as 'subjective' and 'rational' to make it sound like you're not being biased, however you are treating your views and opinions like they're pretty damn objective.
---
Nah, just want people to explain to me why they think "Classic is the best WoW version" etc. You're literally the only person to give me an actual tangible example that wasn't purely emotionally charged, and after a lot of prodding. Think about that for a moment. 
---
And even that response, about the "forced grouping", it's not even that great of a reason either, as I've explained above. The game looks different when you look at the whole thing, which I don't think many people do. They're too focused on a couple of aspects, which is fine I guess. 
---
&gt; I get it, you prefer your train set, I prefer mine. I certainly have my reasons to, and just because you don't agree, it doesn't make me wrong.
---
Technically speaking, an ***opinion*** isn't always wrong. But when you say things like, "My train set is way faster than yours." and it clearly ***isn't***, then there's an issue. Or at least a point of discussion. 
---
&gt; Classic wow and the whole concept of vanilla is popular.
---
Ehhh, is it? Is it though? In the grand scheme of things, is it popular? If you're a company, and you have limited resources and capital, do you spend it on things for the minority of your customers or the majority? Obviously you're going to cater to the larger customer base. 
---
Of the people that play this game, the players that want to play Classic are in that minority, I hate to say it. 
---
&gt; Is your cognitive dissonance so bad that you can't just accept that? Or we can sit here and pick holes in each others' train sets all day if that's what you would like.
---
No, as I said I am simply challenging players to articulate what they like about the game rather than just vague nonsense buzz words. It's actually a useful exercise because being able to communicate is extremely important. Especially with something like this. Think about it, you're literally the only person so far that could actually not type out some shitty catch phrase and explain to me what you liked about the game. How can the developers create a game based on such shitty community feedback? 
---
It's why they are putting the blinders on and trying to just recreate the game as it was because the community doesn't know its ass from its elbow otherwise.
---
Skinning for corehounds, the beast and onyxia
---
Was there a button on the minimap in vanilla?  I don't remember there being one up to WotLK.
---
That's the reason I say when someone asks why I play female.
---
50% orc fury warriors you mean
---
You don’t seem to have any knowledge about private servers.
---
I 100% remember doing this also. Fuck they must have hated us
---
So how do you think the Faction imbalance on retail happened?
---
I wonder if this sense of community is going to last outside the beta? I certainly hope so.
---

The best part of not having a LFG system is that if you want to kick a member of the group out, it will take you an extra 20 minutes (searching for a replacement, the replacement flying to the dungeon, etc) to replace them. People would much rather work harder and succeed then sit through the pain of finding a replacement. No instant gratification in classic!
---
Good job on completing BFD.
---
Also arent the only ones in SMGY. Tons. But its easier to pace and track a streamer for things like AFK, run backs to vendor, wipes etc, than say /who spamming
---
And classic will be 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to remember the name.
---
We play as Undead, Troll, Tauren, Gnome...and you're drawing the line at gender?  The whole point of this game is to play a role.  Play whatever you want, and let your friends play whatever they want.
---
This is a literal change. I think wow classic was great because minimal time gating.
---
With the war effort each server has there own pace
---
I played hunter in vanilla and can't decide if I want to go tank warrior, resto shaman, or just play hunter again. I will certainly have a hunter as my first alt if its not my main.
---
I remember being able to solo farm so many things that were impossible for most other classes. There is such a HUGE gap between good and bad hunters in vanilla.
---
We did! We improved our positioning and finished the instance successfully.
---
They finally replaced it about 5 months ago,
---
I'm not gonna lie that couch would have seen some awful things throughout the years.
---
There's footage of his model in gameplay, I think it looks great, but your mileage may vary.
---
Nope that was my point, it was a modern retail thing that was part of ending your flight early and why they also changed how flight looked on fps. But it seems they just took that all out finally rather than leaving it in which may be what fixed the flight path look.
---
I’ve played alliance and horde since vanilla through all expansions: I have never visited Darnassus. I have no idea what it looks like(I might have seen screen shots and pictures but I cant put my mind to it) Im looking forward to classic to discover it for the first time
---
&gt; No kidding, back in Vanilla one of my guildies would get his daughter to farm for him on his Hunter. She was only 7yo or something.
---
Solo farming Tribute or Maraudon as a Hunter actually does take some skill. If I had a kid I'd teach him.
---
yeah... that was the exact reason I had them :-)
---
Pretty much. It’s not hard to be a top anything if the standards are so low. Basically handing out trophies to whoever plays the longest.
---
I wonder what happened to the Eastern Kingdomds in the WoD alternate verse
---
Does Stormwind not burn down? Do Arthas and Uther stay bros because no Legion and no Undead? Does he pump a baby into Jaina and mary her to strengthen ties with Kul' Tiras? Does Kael' Thas cry in the corner at the ceremony like the incel he always was?
---
Good idea to break it up for horde only.  Need more answers right now though.  I have a hard time believing druids will be close to that high horde.
---
&gt; You can tell that not only does feedback and bug reports work, but they clearly pay close attention to the subreddit aswell. Nothing but respect to team working there.
---
Yeah, cause it's probably not the team that worked on BfA.
---
Ion is actually excited for this, unlike modern WoW.
---
Josh probably had a point that it would be tough for someone who disagreed to listen to that segment, since there was no opposing voice. 
---
It was great for me. I'm assuming that people who support banning and Blizzard interference are of the same *significant* minority who badgered Blizzard to ruin retail by trying to introduce all sorts of systems to guide players. Much better to let the world be a world and let players figure things out for ourselves. Therefore it felt nice to hear all the guests express that.
---
Well, yeah, I won’t jump 3 people of my level knowing they’re just gonna kill me, but if it’s 2 people and I’m like a rogue or something, I would sap one (wait for a trinket) and jump the other - not because I’m confident I can take both down, but because I’m confident that if I can’t, I can always escape 😋
---
Why would you want to say that?!
---
yeah because effort is meaningless lol
---
You... I like you...
---
will havin 310 herbalism mitigate the fail moreso than 300 herbalism?
---
From what I've seen they're always oom at the end of the pull if they were even a bit less geared they would never kill  a single aoe pull.
---
AoE grinding dungeons will simply not be viable due to mana limitations.
---
Yeah why not pour pure diabetes down your throat to help fill the pockets of corporations.
---
You're still doing the same dungeons over and over in classic, whether it says heroic or not...
---
Would fury warrior tank still use shield in defense stance?
---
Several factors. Which faction they've played in the past. What race entails the fantasy they are after. Appearance, which race looks the coolest. Which continent do they want to start leveling in and so forth.
---
Effort is being good. These are slackers doing basic tank and spank.
---
A level 10 fedex run is *highly* suboptimal. Usually you would return to questing at 5-7max.
---
I feel like Charlie Bucket looking for that fn golden ticket every time I log on.
---
Not saying it never happened but I never heard of any attempts to do a dedicated X-60 dungeon crawl with a committed group during Vanilla.
---
It may have happened but if it did it certainly never proved to be faster than Joana or people would have heard about it.
---
There will certainly be groups of hardcore players attempting this on launch this time around so now onlly time will tell if it's as fast. I doubt it will be as fast for most, but I also suspect that it won't be too far behind + grinding dungeons should get everybody in your group at least a few pre-bis pieces. Biggest downside I can see is professions but those may prove to be impossible to level anyway.
---
Am I the only one who likes the new models better? Hopefully they just create a toggle option so people can have whichever they prefer.
---
You would stance dance and gear swap in reaction to the incoming damage patterns.
---
Yea, right up there with Oculus.
---
Hunters counter rogue
---
I felt the same way in retail. Professions are UTTERLY pointless. :(

Jesus this comment made me laugh loud enough to wake the baby.
---
I was shocked that they didn't have another trailer at Blizzcon. I think until recently they believed Classic would be a footnote and now they're having to ramp up their marketing efforts.
---
Finkle's skinning knife or whatever its called is needed for that
---
I mean, it just isn't. Maybe in a 1v1 duel environment, but frankly, 25% stun is fucking retarded op.
---
It's all matchup dependent. Rogue vs Rogue orc wins, but its just all rng.
---
You also gotta figure while Perception is only good for a few things, in vanilla half the classes a reliable to semi-reliable stun (And everyone has nades).
---
A 25% of resisting a charge vs vanilla warriors cannot be understated as they're bound to 1 shot you out of stealth. Same for dodging a pally stun, or a 5s druid bash...
---
Or god grenades, any of the other items...
---
Stun is good, yo.
---
Mad? Mate when you are the only one being cheeky aren't you begging for some sort of reply? I do think my observation is kinda funny tho. The guy that couldn't help himself but to write that definitely enjoys smashing levels 1s, banter mate.
---
Probably not it's just a newer side of communities that perhaps many people havnt had the chance to be a part of yet.  Not everyone watches twitch.
---
HELL YEA
---
I picked UD warlock because I thought it looked cool. I picked up tailoring because I wanted to make my own gear. I picked up engineering because there was a bug at the time that allowed you to jumper cables your demo sac'ed pet for both DemoSac and MasterDemo buffs.  
---
It had nothing to do with min/max'ing and was 100% about what I thought was cool at the time.  
---
Given the chance, I'd do it all over again.
---
IDK how people sit in gaming chairs all day, I got a Herman-Miller and never looked back.
---
OP blows and sucks a lot of goddamn D!
---
Not sure if you realize this but, most streamers are T1 players. They are some of the hardest HK's to pull off. It's a pipe dream thinking they are easy kills. That being said avoiding them will be as simple as playing on a different server. Think about it bro they play 8+ hours a day. They ain't gonna be bad lol.
---
First time I ever heard this song was in a feral druid pvp video. I shortly after leveled my first druid to 60 back in retail vanilla. Good memories
---
Shaman will be really popular. Almost as popular as warrior. Other bigger polls support this too
---
Word. Gave him a DV and you an UV
---
Classic is getting a updated client,the system requirements will be much higher than the original game.
---
I don't think it would run very well on that machine.
---
No at 300 you gain 0 chance to fail picking.
---
Something tells me the toxic kids wont be able to live without frontloaded content and instant gratification. They will soon return to their BfA loot pinhata
---
And what servers are you seeing this on? Hour-long named mob quests is an extreme exaggeration.
---
I'm a Mythic raider in BFA. While the difficulty is far beyond what old WoW had, I do agree that running through a raid on 2-3 difficulties before getting to the hardest fucking sucks and takes all excitement out of it.
---
I want killing the end boss to be prestigious. I don't care if mine is harder and has better loot, you kill C'thun, you kill C'thun. No easy mode bullshit.
---
It looks like I just might, although it doesn't say it in my system preferences. But according to apple support my computer has it.
---
Your comparing xp/hr vs gold just to be stubborn....
---
I just started private so I dont know much but regardless of xp, the same mob drops different levels of stuff so tossing the low end to get more higher value is better too, plus helps the xp/h as a bonus.
---
Dont be stubborn just because you cant lose an argument.
---
I gave you an UV.
---
"first"
---
That's like asking a group of cigarette smokers why they smoke and they all have different reasons.  Sure that might be why they started but now it's just a physical problem and they cant get over it.
---
To be fair, is there a faction imbalance on retail? [https://realmpop.com/eu.html](https://realmpop.com/eu.html) says 50/50?
---
As a gnome (+15 engineering), the arcanite dragonling from engineering is level 63 when you summon it instead of level 60. This makes it hit harder and miss less. Awesome for pvp or dmg in general.
---
56.25%*
---
yeah i heard the sit thing doesn't workl. my question is about world pvp when farming on off raid days. i dont care about tanking and all of that
---
Yeah and you wouldn't do SM?
---
So you leveled him multiple times? Ha. Had you argued, 'i leveled multiple Priest in vanilla and well understood the 5 sec rules etc.' I would have argued the maths. But this is just you saying, i played priest in vanilla. Rofl. Well plenty of Legolas weapon needing hunters played during vanilla should they be the authority on hunters? Restated, so what? You playing priest during vanilla is not evidence of your claim.
---
Look at the tree and you tell me what skills you get in shadow that make you better pre-40. No darkness, no shadowform, 5/5 in shadow weaving that you finish at 34 (which per typical solo pull is &lt;6% increased damage. Wooooww.)
---
Now look at 5/17/8 or 18/2/10. Tons of benefit.
---
If you aren't into gaming MacBooks are, or well, were really good. They have gone down in quality and there's pretty good alternatives now but for regular use they were about the best. Their trackpads are still best and their superiority has been known for over a decade so I still don't understand why no-one else hasn't managed to reverse engineer it and improve their own.
---
I have both of these, unopened lol
---
The power of the +skill racial is how they work. It allows you to start herbing new herbs at earlier levels, but it does not change what skill things go green, so essentially it helps you all the way. 
---
If herb A) goes green at 150 herbalism, and you can pick herb B) at 160, with +15 you can level on herb A) all the way to 160 without it going green, and then pick herb B). This makes leveling professions very easy.
---
I read this last night while holding my own son in my arms (5 months old) I spent the next 20 minutes thinking about it.
---
Its funny back then I didn't really think about how much it would of meant to my parents, but now looking at my son I would be pretty devastated if he dodged a family holiday to play games at least without talking to me first.
---
Now I would love to do another family holiday with my parents, its funny how life changes us.
---
I really don't see the point of giving the Best offhand to a 2nd warrior after the Main Tank here are some of my Thoughts about it.  
---
1) warriors have limited bag space cus of tank gear and probably not gonna use SP consumes.  
---
2) warriors already have AoE dmg and the debuffs are shit it's only the chain dmg that's nice.  
---
3) the point about flurry is kinda useless since rogues have Slice and Dice.
---
310, gloves enchant is not enough, you need the fimkles or zulian slicer
---
I feel like that’s the only way to make this build beast! Then again rolling on balance gear is pretty much us fighting a mage/warlock for there gear right lol
---
&gt; But how can his ghost show up if his soul is inside Frostmourn?
---
It's magic, ain't gotta explain shit. Here's my 2c:
---
-- A part of Uther's presence is still here, maybe his items were imbued with a piece of him
---
-- The soul inside Frostmourne can manifest in this holy place due to its significance
---
Those people are stupid because Orcs are better rogues.
---
it's not about asking why they smoke
---
it's about asking them if they use the word addict or addiction to describe themselves or their use
---
then asking them what those words mean to them, and how they're different
---

I feel like it was higher, 310 or 315. Finkles and a ZG weapon have +10, gloves have +5. I believe you also need 315 for Ony scales.

"WeLl SiNcE iT wAs ReLeAsEd FoR tBc, AbSoLuTeLy NoT #nOcHaNgEs" - Somebody, somewhere.
---
Nope, thats TBC.
---
TBC is 80/20 ish H/A ratio, due to the game being completly imbalanced in terms of factions. (Horde has far superior racials for PvE and PvP, and there is  not really any geographical advantages to being alliance besides being closer to Kara I guess).
---
Vanilla has great faction balance because of geographical advantages (Ironforge close to blackrock mountains, Orgr closer to DM etc etc.) So basically both faction have advantages in their own continent.
---
And the factions have different metas because Alliance has paladins, and horde has shamans. Which greatly impacts raid balance and set ups (casters are better on Alliance, melees are slightly better on horde, paladins probably is the best scaling healer in long fights etc.) With different pros and cons on different raids ( Nefarian is easier for alliance because of paladin class call being way easier to deal with than shaman class call).
---
I think it will be good balance, but that all goes down the fucking drain if they decide to go TBC, where factions servers will be introduced (one faction dominates any server), and almost all players will be playing horde.
---
For Skinning and Mining, there are some things you won't be able to get without having a higher than 300 skill.
---
For Herbalism (and the other two), you still have a chance to fail at picking up high level nodes at 300. If you find a Black Lotus and start picking it up, someone else could still swoop in and take it if you happen to fail.
---
There are various items that increase the professions, not all classes can use all these items. However there are enchants available that you can get instead (you just won't be able to reach the max possible number).
---
The crafting professions, not so much. Really the only benefit Gnomes get with Engineering is some ease in leveling it because they can learn some recipes sooner and for Twinking purposes.
---
yeah they put it 30 hrs a week and getting would firsts
---
total slackers

You too man, keep thinking you can play a ret paladin because Esfand said so
---
wait what book was published in 2018 lol?
---
Ugh, dunno how I fucked that up. Thanks.
---
It’s a video game. That’s like masturbating for 30hrs and claiming to be pro at sex.
---
I know the stun resistance is incredibly strong, but breaking Stealth on a Rogue was pretty game-breaking itself. Losing out on an opener was a big deal.
---
Honestly it all comes down to what class you're playing anyway. I'm a Mage so I'd personally use a Frost Grenade anyway and either force an early Vanish or watch him eat a shatter.
---
I doubt Joana is going to have the WR with his first 60. It's possible that he doesn't even set a personal record with his fiirst run.
---
There are a number of people who have practiced Joana's routes more than he has himself since Joana quit WoW, thanks to private servers. I suspect that one of them will hold the WR for /played time as well as having the world first 60 this time around.
---
I got accidental access yesterday for like 45 seconds, my feelings are fragile right now.
---
Agreed, not that garbage energy drink they did this year...
---
I agree, but I wanna point out that new players in Retail struggle with bags aswell. And a few months into Classic we will be doing the exact same thing.
---
Great comment, you very mature, very stable genius.

I thought we were talking about a game....

10y olds in classic, not bad
---
 FTR International, just google it.
---
Then you should know the struggles of leveling and especially as everyone is trying to level you just group together.
---
Hehe Blues Brothers
---
A random number (supposedly all increased) is a timegate as well. Especially if it’s substantially increased, which would be needed to have an impact such as what you are asking.
---
Dat wall of text just crit me hard. I need healing!
---
Problem is they have already done most of the 30s quests to farm lvl 30 BiS items, so at this point they can't quest at all
---
Maybe it's fun
---
Nothing can stop me from playing ret. My name on beta is a joke to the effect of "Rets only get to raid if they swing nightfall", but more likely than not I will end up healing, because I enjoy it and it is in demand.
---
Also, go fuck yourself.
---
What's the new ElitistJerks.com for wow classic?
---
All those letters in my reply and you focused on just those three.  
---
It's honestly no surprised you get triggered so hard by high levels ganking you.
---
Hell yes!
---
Fishing is a big one.
---
While leveling the profession, the chance to catch better things, or not let whatever is on your hook get away can be mitigated by having the +skill.
---
Also certain areas require over 300 to fish at all. The only one that comes to mind at the moment is Bay of Storms in Azshara.
---
Well I am playing a priest on release.
---
I call it rocket fuel
---
Crafting professions are typically not that useful.  
---
Leatherworking makes leather and mail gear, so it would be the one that makes stuff for your class, but like I said there isn't anything needed that is binds on pickup.  There are good recipes that make boe items, but they typically only drop off raid bosses or are exceedingly rare.  
---
Engineering is overtly OP in vanilla, so is suggested for everyone.  Then either mining or herbalism for gold making.  
---
Blacksmithing can be useful for one single item,  https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia
---
but engineering has many many useful items so take priority.  I would only go blacksmithing if you end up with an excess of gold, or an you have an alt you can farm with.
---
Def a game problem. I love TBC, but the difficulty combined with the attunements made it more hardcore than Vanilla ever was. And when they finally removed the attunements (2.4), they added so much catch-up gear that it made the early tiers irrelevant.
---
It was just unnecessary. Even Vanilla didn't have those crazy attunements.
---
Which one is the gnome?
---
Nah, i'd say more towards Blizzcon - Christmas area.
---
Best setup is tank, healer and 3 dps

---
Good argument :)
---
I would buy. Ez
---
It's a stretch okay. If anyone was wearing green items it would be because some odd item somehow was better for that specific class/build/purpose and they insisted on using that gimmick. If their tank actually wore greens on a progression kill this would have been very late in TBC and he would have been boosted through all of the previous content with no time to pick up gear. Archimonde was actually one of the few bosses at this stage which required decently geared tanks because the healers were constantly disrupted by fire trails, aoe fears or knockups putting them far far away from the action.
---
It won't happen probably and yes it is a big missed opportunity
---
Oh man, thottbot, that takes me back....
---
Most duelers/tournaments ban SL because its too strong
---
Could also be a reference to Terry Pratchett's discworld serie
---
The hunter’s responses are classic.

You guys are really pulling at straws, there will be more beta invites, I’ll bet my left nut on that. But this isn’t a hint

---
That said good luck brothers and sisters of reddit
---
Pretty shocked rogues are so low right now.
---
Why is being a fan of a streamer a big deal? I’m a cdew fan, had a blast watching him win blizzcon. I generally don’t watch him very much because I work a lot, and really only like watching him do arena. But why is it wrong for me to be a fan? But somehow being a Michael Jordan fan is fine? Because YOU deem basketball a worthy sport but not wow? 
---
Fuck you dude let people enjoy what they enjoy without shitting on them.
---
I will probably go to 6 or 7 and then level normally and just go to 10 if its really overcrowded. I should get to NE starting area at 6 which should be one of the lower populated areas.
---
I remember in Vanilla you could destroy your hearthstone and use the unstuck button to hearth home. I wonder if that will be fixed in wow classic to simply move your character a few feet.
---
6pm PST usually.
---
Ahh gotcha.  But is the armor difference for a single piece like that really so significant?
---
Assuming you do wear the gloves, you're looking at one more weapon skill as human (to get past that magic 8 number) versus 7 for other races.  And as NE you'd get 1% dodge, and as Dwarf you'd get Stoneform.  So the difference assuming you're using those gloves doesn't seem all that big.

I wonder if linking to the EU page instead of the US one means anything.
---
I'm unsure but what do you think they mean if not the beta invites?
---
I didn't watch it live, but I've seen footage since. Nameplates work for totems as well.
---
Click the link
---
Maybe I'm weird but when I'm playing I'm looking at my target, my health and resources and the surroundings for any surprises, not my character's ass. Maybe that's the reason why some people have hard time clearing even easy content...
---
As I said, matchup / build dependant. Even with perception a human won't find win the opening on a 5/5 imp stealth rogue if the human is 0/5
---
In fact, a catseye goggle nightelf will beat a 5/5 stealth human if he doesn't have goggles, so there's some issues.
---
All that does too is win the opener; ideally you're garroting an orc rogue, but with iffy ping and sprint, you gotta go for the tab cheapshot route.
---
Then it gets bad - if he DOES resist that CS your entire advantage is blown, all the while he still has a great shot at resisting you.
---
Though, as a human, +sword skills is pretty fucking sick.
---
I could write essays on the silly mechanics that go into vanilla; but yeah no fuck playing vanilla rogues, you're just asking to become food for a warrior/hunter/shaman/priest/warlock/druid
---
&gt; Your conclusion here isn't universally true. While perfect balance probably never will happen. It doesn't have to lead to normalization and blandness.
---
Balancing for &gt;20-player content doesn't lead to normalization because the 'peaks and valleys' in individual performance can be flattened out by group utility, if designed well.
---
Enhancement shaman aren't going to do as much DPS as a warrior, but they buff 4 other people with WF totem... same thing with Moonkin/Mages.  Of course, DPS/healing meter obsessed players would complain about this for PvE but it's a much bigger issue in small group PvP.  If a Paladin is going to be worse than another class in 3v3 every single time (since a Priest would heal better and Warrior would DPS better), that Pally is not going to be able to do any high-level 3v3 gameplay whatsoever.
---
Basically, the smaller the group you try to balance for, the more normalized the classes have to be in order to achieve that balance.  So moderate balance at the &gt;20-player scale allows for a wide variety in classes.  But moderate balance at the 3v3 scale requires classes to be much more uniform in DPS/healing/survivability.
---
However...
---
I don't think it'd be a big deal to have "duel" and add in "group skirmish" where your group could challenge another group to a duel-like fight.  No honor points involved, no in-game stat tracking, and no need for strict balance... the same way that a 1v1 duel has no in-game benefit and therefore no need for strict balance.
---
Shit got deleted when i was halfway through the story wtf RIP
---
Not at all. Warriors really ain't that bad to require hardcore style play, but they definitely do level very slowly solo. If you can help it definitely go with the Troll Priest first. Priests can do quite a bit by themselves just fine. Leveling as Shadow is also perfectly viable to heal any dungeon too if you need to. Also definitely consider Wanding often and picking up 5/5 Wand Spec in the Tier 1 Disc tree. Leveling my priest back in Vanilla, I'd just Mind Blast and Wand shit to death. Occasionally I'd throw a SW:P on them too but a lot of times shit would die before that had much of an effect anyway.
---
PW:S, Mind Blast, Wand Wand Wand &amp; Win.

Throwing around mad and triggered like it's in your everyday vocabulary, sit down man i look forward to being punished constantly ima be a balance druid afterall.

---
Yeah I remember High Warlord transfers too.
---
Were is Faxmonkey! That guy was the OG Troll Mage
---
1) warriors have limited bag space cus of tank gear and probably not gonna use SP consumes.
---
Only if they are tanks. Many warriors don't have bags filled with tank gear. As a tank, I use SP consumes. Many dps warriors use shadow oils + SP consumes.  So meh trash point. SP consumes don't make a huge difference in the end anyway besides Flask of supreme power. 
---
 And if you are using Flask of Supreme over Titans you are probably meming in a farm run or are just so rich you don't know what to do with your gold.
---
Yes we have aoe damage. We can proc thunderfury multiple times with whirlwind and cleave. Rogues cannot. Tanks don't really have aoe damage and it is invaluable for them.
---
You probably want to give it to an OT, because you basically need multiple "MTs" for Naxx anyway. Your MT might leave or something too. But if you were gonna give to a dps, fury warriors have near 100% flurry uptime and can rage dump into hamstring to get even more procs, which they already do on horde side to proc windfury/crusader. Also, they could use it to tank, someday. The main reason it might be better on rogue in my mind is the threat issue is somewhat mitigated by using Vanish. Horde side too, swords are better on rogues and warriors tend more towards orc + axes. So that is certainly an argument. I mainly play alliance so didn't think about that initially.
---
!RemindMe 83 days
---
You’re forgetting AQ and Naxx, which gives Horde another advantage.
---
When you have 5 people, AoE farming becomes easy no matter what. The thing that might be different on live is that you won't get into an AoE group if you don't have AoE, unless you have friends willing to carry you.
---
The ideal AoE farming group is 3/5 mages and 2/5 paladins.
---
Mine goes to the US page
---
Ah I see, thanks.
---
How good is the 8-piece set? Does it proc often; do we have numbers?

It's the first "Deep Delve" dungeon. So large they put in a shortcut. 
---
Can't wait.
---
Healers would be in more need I'd say. Most tanks are also Guild/Raid Leaders so usually 1 of the 2 (or 4 if in Naxx) spots are always taken.
---
You can level a Priest very easily using Shadow with 5/5 Wand Spec in Disc. and wanding shit. You can still heal any dungeon just fine even as Shadow anyway.
---
The game is already 1.13 though.
---
Hmm?

Holy shit, why do people who hate streamers so much watch them?

Standing on people while they are dueling is the most heinous crime imaginable and is worthy of death threats and is a sign of mental illness!  Raiding a funeral is fine and morally justified though.

Yeah you couldn’t be more wrong. You’re probably confusing Vanilla with TBC. So far literally every top guild is going Alliance because Vanilla favors Alliance so much.

Seriously, you said you were downvoted for an opinion, he looked through your comment history to confirm your story and couldn't find any evidence. And when queried you call him stupid without actually showing where you were downvoted.
---
For raids there are three levels. Normal, Heroic and Mythic. Normal and Heroic work off a scaling difficulty that adjusts to the number of members in your raid with the hope the difficulty is reasonably consistent no matter your raid size. The minimum / lowest scale is 10 players. It's a good system in the context of modern WoW given some guilds might have 15 players who want to raid - one day maybe you have 14 signs, another 17 but you can still do the raid without benching people.
---
Mythic is the highest level for raids and it is set to a flat, non-negotiable 20 people like older expansions.
---
Mythic+ is a system similar to rifts in D3. Each player gets a key that they can upgrade in level by doing the one they currently have in time. The higher the key, the more affixes it has and the more damage and health the mobs have. From level 10+ you have 4 affixes, 3 of those affixes change each week and 1 changes for each 'season' (basically just raid patch) of mythic+.
---
Hope that helps, I'm bad at explaining!
---
As undead, I prefer to just eat their corpse.
---
Weak trolling attempt. Play whatever you want.
---
I think it has more to do with WoW's prunning and simplification. All the classes/professions are less interesting now.
---
The last time I leveled up a character was in legion and I noticed how much cooler and more interesting all my engineering stuff was compared to later expacs. The Garrison just in WoD just felt like a mobile game, at which point I was kind of done.
---
So triggered jesus.  You are the one that got all pissy because I stated an objective fact (that everyone leveling right now is in level 30 twink gear)
---
I feel like TBC is a pretty good improvement on most concepts from vanilla. Class fantasy and uniqueness was still there, it was just more fleshed out and felt good in my opinion. There are issues of course but nothing too bad I don't feel like.
---
Bro I’m 23 and wish I was 20. Life is about to slap you in the nuts these next few years.
---
Shaman never really changes it just does more damage faster. 
---
Vanilla was on a timescale so different (both personally and by itself) that it's hard to say. I was 12 years old when I started playing, so I literally did nothing but go to school and play WoW, so I had loads of time to get multiple characters to 60.
---
Lots of people had "twinks" with BiS gear at the 19, 29, 39th levels that were insanely geared out thanks to their mains. 
---
It really depends on your time commitment / priorities. You can easily level up both slowly or rush to hit 60 with one. Depends on what you wanna do bud :)
---
You helped create a monster warrior buddy! Amazing times :)

Then blizz releases a BFA kind of patch and we are back at asking for vanilla classic, NO CHANGES.

I think Nax is about even, its slightly further away from IF/SW but they can just fly there and don't have to deal with the zeppelin.

SHIT
---
Well there is undeniably a clear difference when you compare TBC Druid and Classic Druid. The thing is, Druid isn't really an actual class in Classic since a lot of its tools are simply bad. Very bad. So you are limited to Resto DoT and run playstyle. I find that fun but he might not. He is a hardcore Feral player anyway.
---
I always assume all female characters are males anyways. Learned that lesson when I was 15 and got on vent with these two "girls" I was running dungeons with and in vent, they turned out to be ~40 yo dudes lol.
---
This guy gets full immersion
---
You're welcome! I am doing the same \^\^. I will try to find a hunter video for you, I think most of the ones I watched back then were twink hunters though.
---
Lots of druids still want leather gear for PvP / their 5man tanking/meme dps builds. 
---
IDK in classic we had lots of warriors who fought rogues for 1handers, my guild was probably bad, was just based off my memory.
---
It will automatically redirect you to the correct one based on your geolocation.
---
&gt;Doubtful. This isn't Blizzard's MO. When they opened new realms in the past, they just showed up on the list on the same day they announced it. 
---
I sincerely hope they do announce them in advance. While it's not their MO, neither were legacy servers.  
---
Without proper announcements in advance of launch it becomes very difficult to properly co-ordinate all friends/old server mates migrating back to the same place again.
---
blasphemy
---
Feel free to link it mate!
---
As everybody is uploading their character screens, I was wondering about your UIs!  
---
I am absolutely thrilled to configure my UI as in 2005. See above! Maximum information, maximum efficiency!
---
Eh, the 10slotters are 2g each from vendors, that means that they'll have to sell for less than 2g on the AH. I expect to have decently comfortable bagspace (full 10slots) around level 30. It won't be anything like BFA, but that's ok.
---
What about the people who loves Cata, or MoP?
---
Are Blizzard going to have 7 different versions of the game running at the same time? And yes, a lot of people really liked MoP.
---
Even I thought arena was fun in Cata (only time I ever played arena in WoW)
---
Yes but Im asking if we will know the realm list prior to the days we can log in and reserve our names.
---
Guilds and new forming guilds will want to decide what server they are creating on before Blizz flipps the switch and let's people log on for the reserving.
---
GLHF :D
---
I still have some of the pet fuel on two of my alts.

I do like intentionally setting myself up for an uphill battle, but i did also read a elaborate analysis that i barely understood saying that balance druid isnt actually *that* terrible. Hey atleast i give 3% crit to my group. Not interested in joining some minmax guild anyway, isn't showing up good enough most of the time?
---
[Right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/89ted0/keftenks_writeup_and_gear_spreadsheet_for_moonkin/)
---
There were rumors back in vanilla about warlock initially being a Horde only race, possibly even instead of shaman, but I'm not sure I believe it. 
---
I highly doubt mage was ever considered to be Alliance only, it's too iconic.
---
They'll be announced on August 12th when we can create characters.
---
That gives you 14 days before launch to coordinate.

The drop chances are so low on the bindings and having one doesn't guarantee the other will drop next. Most guilds will go all of classic without anyone getting one of the drops, and the guilds that do definitely aren't giving them to dps. Rogues thinking they'll get one is an even bigger pipe dream. But who knows there will probably be more pugs clearing mc this time around so maybe someone will get lucky rolls on them lol.

A) It sounds like someone had a tab open when Asmongold was talking about 1.13.
---
B) It sounds like someone wasn't actually listening to what Asmongold said. 
---
Look, this is a fact - TBC is insanely popular. It just is. You can argue blah blah blah "shit elements" but TBC is insanely popular. 
---
TBC is a step in the "money" direction. It's almost certainly going to happen unless Classic flops which seems unlikely.
---
I heard, which sucks. It puts a damper on that build then. But the Reckoning build despite being in Prot was good for anything. You could still front-load Reck Bombs on Players and destroy them. But the Paladins kit is pretty extensive in PvP. You get Divine Protection early on, Lay on Hands, great buffs, long stun (HoJ), Snare removal (BoF), and being Human with Stealth Detect or Dwarf with Stoneskin, both are great pvp racials.
---
mine looks like that but with 50% more clutter.
---
Just play what you want to and don't let the idea that some losers might judge you for it sway you. I just play whatever looks best; lightforge and judgement look pretty rad on the female human model, so I'm going for that with my paladin. All the janky gear a fury warrior needs for BiS looks better on the male model because you can get shirts that go up to the neck, so I'm going with that for my warrior. Any orc or troll I play is automatically female, because I don't want my character to have a busted spine.
---
&gt;The things you listed are niche nowadays. Those things aren't common in current gaming trends.
---
They also aren’t options for players nowadays, and in general was a business focused shift not a market desire shift. It’s the reason we have seen the decline in mmorpgs, if fast paced easy to achieve content was desired in the mmorpgs we would have seen a large growth over the last decades instead of s decline.
---
 &gt;Current gaming trends are high octane, high action, quick games with suspenseful buildup, in succession using matchmaking.
---
This is entirely a illusion. High octane, high action, quick games with suspenseful buildup in succession was the popular gaming trend in 2004. Dota, CS, Halo, call of duty, perfect dark, mortal combat, quake, and I’m sure many more I can’t think of all fit this criteria. The idea that all modern gamers want fast games and is a new trend is pretty much bullshit a large number of gamers always wanted these type of games. 
---
It’s not a consumer perspective thing, it’s just easier from a business perspective to build fast paced action games for a quick buck. Building a MOBA, arena shooter, and battle royals is just cheaper and less risky than investing in a traditional MMORPG. The demand for these longer form games never left just the supply did.
---
Way too late for that, if there was no changes the game wouldn't be based on 1.12.1 for MC release, or have items upgraded.
---
They are most likely giving out Ice barbed spear for free, and the lvl 50 sunken temple quests (which gives out much better rewards than the 60 gear which was available at the time)
---
Balance actually really strong, unless you spec all the way down to moonkin. Then you're boned.
---
Well, this was also literally 14~ years ago. I wasn't very good at the game but in a 40 man raid you were bound to have people who weren't good (like yours truly).
---
And yes, I realized very quickly you hardly ever look at your character itself.
---
Soul **shards** not soul stones. They don't stack either.
---
Who said anything about a Zeppelin? When the Scourge Invasion hit Vanilla, Undercity became the de-facto Horde capital.
---
You hate tbc? That is fine ,but there are a ton of people who do like it.
---
&gt;Look, this is a fact - TBC is insanely popular. It just is. You can argue blah blah blah "shit elements" but TBC is insanely popular.
---
So was Cata, and MoP.
---
Should they host those expansions as well?
---
That's such a sick video, thanks for the share! rogues really were OP ... regardless of level xD
---
Private servers use the original WoW client from 2004. Of course it runs well. Classic runs a modern fork, so it's more like Legion/BFA with all the settings turned down low.
---
Yeah, I hated that change. Some shit about making the Artifact bows more special for Legion but still only the artifact bow shows a quiver
---
I hope so too, and I believe it will.
---
Not really, no.
---
This, I love vanilla and having a 1.13 sounds a blast, but I also don't think it's fair to leave people without tbc after vanilla.
---
The dream is to have Blizzard give us options, even if it sounds crazy. Let people have the option to stay in vanilla (Progressing to 1.13 or not) or move on to TBC.
---
The side effect would be having some communities being fragmented, but I'm sure people wouldn't mind as much if that means progressing the way they want. 
---
Also, tbc would probably be easier to code than vanilla, right? They have more data on this expansion.
---
Doesnt even know how to properly meme... sad.
---
I think you'll enjoy Shaman :)
---
Ugh man. I feel this, and day one on the beta, the 6 slot begging was real, 
---
However.. I was happy af to send my mage alt some 8 slotters. So, I'm not sure how long that weird. no bag. space is cool thing will be
---
Put everything in the lowest setting and you’ll be fine. WoW is very CPU heavy and Intel is great for WoW  because of higher single core performance.
---
Soul Shards, not Soul Stones. Soul Shards are used to summon demons, make spell stones &amp; soul stones, etc. If you're doing a battle ground, raid, or even dungeon, it can be tough to make soul shards since you need to get the killing blow with drain soul. So you have to make bag space for quite a few just in case you don't have an opportunity to make more.
---
Even if it is a 2% Proc rate, it is extremely valuable. 
---
But we don’t have any hard data right now. I wouldn’t trust Private Server numbers (when it comes to proc rates), so it is mostly a wait and see. The only way I see it not being worth it, is if it is like .5% or something atrocious, and it will not be that low.
---
Yes but you can only create 3 characters during the reservation period and if there's multiple servers how do you effectively reserve the character name you want if you have to then wait and coordinate with 40 other guildmates or friends?
---
Yeah I guess to clarify I feel that Blizzard would have to give us the realm list at least a few days before name reservation to give people time to figure out what to roll on, since getting in quickly is important in reserving names.
---
Maybe I'm wrong here but I've just been expecting a realm list at least a a week or two before the name reservation period.
---
I meant shards. Warlocks don't need bag fulls of them while leveling.
---
Shame this post was a meme, I'd have liked to see people's layouts even though 99% of them would just be the sleek-but-look-pretty-much-the-same-UI-replacement-addon UIs.  
---
Still like seeing them though.
---
Mtn dew shrinks your testicles. 
---
Actually not it just tastes terrible.
---
Nonsense, everyone knows you go Orc for the stun resist to make paladins rage-quit.
---
So they are going to roll a mid tier class on a mid tier race because, they have game knowledge? WoTf is the most overhyped ability in the game. Orc rogues are way better then Undead ones but, they don't look nearly as cool.
---
Depends on how heavily they layer. They will probably layer enough in phase 1 that you won't have issues getting mobs.
---
The UI is mostly the same as Vanilla, minus the settings menu, the raid unit frames, and the addons/macro API (which is being pulled-in from modern WoW with some adjustments).
---
Here's a crazy idea, what if we got TBC and classic stayed how it was aswell, you can stay on classic and anyone who wants TBC can go play that.
---
Glad we’ll finally get to reclaim this from the crazy frog Idiots on r/Donald
---
But you still have to go orgr if you are doing the Ony head, and I guess DM buffs is an option as well depending on how hardcore the guild is.
---
I will assume people still will be in orgr, maybe HS in UC, but they will start the raid in Orgr for the ony head.
---
Yes, 315 for the scales.
---
Because almost always the leveling gear is not worth the price you pay for it. It doesn't make a big enough difference to justify buying the mats and being unable to afford a mount. In Vanilla leveling, you are constantly saving every penny for that mount at lvl 40 or shortly after. You have to buy food and repairs and spells and flight paths already. Just not a lot of money sitting around to buy gear with.
---
I never realized how expensive WoW is
---
1000$ for less than  6 years what the fuck.
---
As long as progressing into them isn't mandatory.
---
So from what I found his dad is a crook, how does that implicate tips? Not convinced yet. Need evidence or it's all drama brigade
---
From the last few weeks of similar polls at least the reddit community is about 15% warlock.
---
Was gonna say, I remember this coming out during WOTLK too.
---
just click the link... i really dont think they are hinting at beta invites here. just making sure your account info is updated to keep it secure. (name,address,email) they tweet this shit all the time it's probably just on an auto cycle.
---
Yeah to be honest there is no way people aren't overstating how *terrible* balance druid is, it cant be that useless.
---
I'm not 100% sure if it's the exact same in vanilla, but when I started in wrath (and the same into Cata I'm almost certain) it was fucking CRAZY how much easier it was to level engineering as a gnome.
---
what faction did you play?  
---
Yeah our server was down quite frequently.
---
Hi not 100% sure if it's the exact same in vanilla, but when i started in wrath (and the same into cata , I'm dad.
---
Damn, this guy Private Servers'!
---
https://gph.is/2KLjNQe

Biggest money saver
---
I hope so. Getting the good names will be a battle over in the first few minutes.
---
WHAT
---
Very few people are in twink gear, You seem to not understand what that word means. I think you might be salty because you clearly dont have beta access
---
Such joy.  I hope to rediscover all that magic in August.
---
&gt;This is entirely a illusion. High octane, high action, quick games with suspenseful buildup in succession was the popular gaming trend in 2004. Dota, CS, Halo, call of duty, perfect dark, mortal combat, quake, and I’m sure many more I can’t think of all fit this criteria. The idea that all modern gamers want fast games and is a new trend is pretty much bullshit a large number of gamers always wanted these type of games. 
---
OK, but all those franchises are still super popular to this day. I can't think of many succesful franchises that are the reverse of that trend. In fact, I think with the success of Battle Royales, that is dialed up to 11. 
---
&gt;Building a MOBA, arena shooter, and battle royals is just cheaper and less risky than investing in a traditional MMORPG. The demand for these longer form games never left just the supply did.
---
Right, I think that goes towards my point. MMOs are very high risk for all those reasons, but those other genres are less. And the MMOs that are on the market, have gone towards more quicker paced gameplay. Hence why Classic Everquest isnt seeing as much excitement for Classic WoW.
---
What if you *could* get the Ashbringer in vanilla WoW, and it's just that nobody found it? :o
---
The group portion is the key.  Everyone saying this is the most efficient aren't considering the amount of shitty groups, the waiting on people to arrive, for the fatties to warm up hot pockets, for the homebodies to waddle to the potty while mommy cooks pizza rolls.  Other people can slow down dungeon grinding significantly, and that's not even considering the wipes.
---
Look, you can be a cheeky boi, or you can accept why TBC is the most obvious direction Blizzard is going to go.
---
&gt; Are Blizzard going to have 7 different versions of the game running at the same time? And yes, a lot of people really liked MoP.
---
That would be the dream.
---
I would love to have max lvl chars on evey expansion and switch between them whenever I want
---
1. Everyone joins a Discord by August 12th.
---
2. Before August 12th, you decide the Server type, timezone, and language (if applicable).
---
3. When August 12th hits, of the chosen type, timezone, and language, there may only be one server. If there's multiple, the first person online in any sort of authority position chooses the name and posts it everywhere in the Discord.
---
3. Everyone makes their 3 characters on that server.
---
I did before writing that previous message. Still unclear.
---
Oh you’re one of those people.
---
Thank you for the input!
---
Our main is going to be horde. But eventually plan on rolling a dwarf priest and a Druid. Going to wait then for alliance my Druid ❤️❤️ Ty!
---
Gnomer was easier to get to for horde than alliance imo.
---
It’s not toxic to hold people to basic reasoning skills.
---
If my responses to you are considered “a raging asshole” you will be spit out and chewed up by the world.
---
Ok
---
Amazing, everything you just said was wrong.
---
IBS won't come out until AV is released. By then most players will have a better weapon.
---
what about account bans?
---
Oh I meant for PVP. And really only if you get at least Nature's Swiftness. They're pretty garbo for everything else.
---
Likewise if your Horde it was “D C P AN PA”
---
&gt;or you can accept why TBC is the most obvious direction Blizzard is going to go.
---
I assume so, I am just saying I think its a mistake, and wasted potential.
---
I think people have severe rose tinted glasses especally related to TBC, and in the age of min-maxing that expansion will be brutal.
---
&gt; If a Paladin is going to be worse than another class in 3v3 every single time 
---
But does that have to be the case? Freedom is great utility. 
---
I get your point though, and I somewhat agree its easier to balance for &gt;20. But it's not impossible to make PvP in Classic somewhat more balanced I think. But I guess its not going to happen either way. Having abilities tuned different for PvP combat and PvE combat could perhaps work.
---
&gt;I don't think it'd be a big deal to have "duel" and add in "group skirmish" where your group could challenge another group to a duel-like fight. No honor points involved, no in-game stat tracking, and no need for strict balance... the same way that a 1v1 duel has no in-game benefit and therefore no need for strict balance.
---
I'd argue that it doesn't have to be balanced to reward stuff. There have been many arena seasons with totally broken op classes.
---
I scheduled two weeks off of work starting August 27th and told my wife that I'm going to disappear for 12 hours/day during that time.  
---
I'm seriously looking forward to this more than anything in the last 10 years.
---
nothing personnel, kid. go back 2 scrub land everything will b ok.
---
Nail it to the wall sideways and get a rope
---
It's like that in vanilla, it's crazy the difference on engineering, it's almost half the cost
---
Yep, I heard all of that these last couple of episodes. The whole arrow thing really grinds my gears, because one it's really not that big of a deal and two there are crafted arrows that do give a bonus. He acted like he had completely forgotten about that, which I'm not buying ... he's always played a hunter as far as I know. He even slipped in a dig at BlizzCon while hosting the classic panel. Did not appreciate that.
---
But I have to say, these old episodes are very refreshing. I've sat through the first two and they are completely vanilla-centric, no commentary on other games, and they're on target with their comments.
---
Hahahahahah, no.
---
A true hero would have stopped Arthas. /spit
---
Yes! We might as well just build up the hype load while we're at it.
---
I call bullshit on that entire premise. There is nothing mutually exclusive about engaging rpg game structure and challenging group raid content.
---
You look at everything...
---
Not sure about that but the pets still buggy with commands
---
Oh, he doesn’t know the meaning of the word “[proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/beholdthemasterrace/comments/bwp8s1/what_do_you_get_when_you_ask_a_racist_idiot_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)”
---
They could do that.
---
After Naxx gets boring they take HALF of the Classic servers and progress them into TBC servers. While the other HALF remain Classic.
---
Then all they have to do is just give ample warning ahead of time and over free transfers off/onto the servers that are going to change to TBC.
---
&gt;Also, tbc would probably be easier to code than vanilla, right? They have more data on this expansion.
---
It would be way way easier, they have way more information and the work done already on the legion client made to vanilla can be used for tbc too and makes a massive difference. I could see blizzard taking a couple of months to have a fully fleshed out tbc.
---
I like quality =)
---
If they released both I would certainly play on the TBC server.  Much better endgame.
---
It's not.
---
Really? I never knew this. Where in BB?
---
So again, not that important for leveling, which is what OP is talking about.
---
It must also be very comforting for them to not have to deal with the burden of creating new content and balancing and ideas, etc. That's always the hardest part of game design, because there is no "one" correct answer. Whereas for classic they have a correct answer. Their goal is to re create vanilla, no matter how good or bad it may be. I'm so glad they have stayed true to this goal the entire time. As long as they keep doing that, classic will be perfect.
---
&gt; make TK and SSC on par with Naxx difficulty 
---
You do realize that both TK and SSC were much much much more difficult than Naxxramas, right?
---
Oh man, I never even knew that existed. That's going to make things much less expensive for my paladin to crank out his gnomish gear and then convert.
---
These aren't mutually exclusive. Post Naxx classic+ sounds cool, but TBC is its own revolution of class balance and raiding. It has many downfalls pertaining to community and world PvP but TBC is its own golden age.
---
Raiding on alliance is way easier. Most Ally dps do more damage then their horde counter parts because of blessing of slavation. Unless you are in a guild of all 1% neck beard super raiders. Salvation&gt;WF totem by a mile.
---
We're on a subreddit about *vanilla WoW*... **VANILLA WOW**... and you're talking about "rose-tinted glasses"? Are you... real right now? I can't even. 
---
I'm going to have to come at you with this one bro - BC &gt; Vanilla. Yeah. It might hurt but uhh... yeah, that's the truth. Deal with it.
---
&gt;IBS won't come out until AV is released. By then most players will have a better weapon.
---
I thought they said they wouldn't have the korrak version of AV, and when is phase 3 released exactly? If its just a few months after release there is absolutely no given that "most" players will outgear it, or even be 60. Not everyone is going to speed-run the game.
---
The novelty of having 2000 people in a zone wears off quickly. Then it just becomes annoying and a hindrance to your own actual gameplay.
---
(x) Doubt
---
For leveling alts and people that come late to the game? Pretty much.
---
While cloth is pretty cheap and common as hell to farm, most people are going to just be chucking it on the AH to get it out of their bags, the "expensive" part is, enchanting.
---
You have to disenchant greens or blues for materials to level it, and the output, is mostly wasted. Yes you can enchant for tips, but while other professions such as blacksmithing, leatherworking can vendor or sell off their outputs, enchanting just goes poof.
---
So it comes down to the tons and tons of greens/blues you have to disenchant to get materials to level. Each enchant can cost you 10-20g per enchant, while something like blacksmithing, that is 1-2 rich thorium nodes. (Hardly difficult to aquire)
---
You won't reach that level casually, that's some min max dedication shit.
---
I'm sure you will find a guild, but your dps is so lackluster you are more likely to be the guy who gets to dps when healing is more than enough for the encounter. Just live with it, druids are better at healing.
---
I think my character is the only thing I'm not looking at when I'm playing. Quite honestly everything else on the screen is more important than the actual character.
---
Yes, when people bring out the already disregarded "\#nochanges" 'argument', when there is already tons of changes in the game, and its a custom version of 1.12.1
---
Yes if we can get the bot pets again.
---
You certainly construct thoughts and sentences and gargantuan paragraphs on nonsense just like an addict.
---
(╭☞ಠ\_ಠ)╭☞
---
I also tried a hunter and a warlock and a warlock(pet) feels so much better in my opinion. When u get your voidwalker at 10 it basically cant die regenerates by himself and doesnt need any maintenance. Not sure if that changes later, but for now Warlock feels so good at leveling.
---
Yes. That's how it should be. All expansions as separate servers.
---
You might not *focus* on your characters ass much during gameplay, but you certainly see it all the time.
---
Let classic be classic and let it end after naxx. Release warcraft 4 which picks up alternative story after classic. While we enjoy that make a wow 2 that pick up where warcraft 4 ends. That would atleast make me excited.
---
This post is everything I miss about the version of WoW I fell in love with.
---
For sure. A lot of the remakes in the video avil of modern CGI tech but completely lose the Blizzard style. If Blizzard were to do it, it'd look like modern WoW's assets.
---
&gt;Is he always this much of an entitled douche?
---
Most popular streamers are very entitled, yeah.
---
1.13 has the CHANCE to be better option than TBC, ftfy
---
I don't think so, TBC is good on paper, but in practice where people follow the trends, TBC is fucking trash as an MMORPG.
---
Good raids and PvE structure tho, everything else is trash.
---
Casual dad's that won't have too much time to play...what woyod be best to play and grt into raids here and there. Mage or Priest?
---
&gt; I guess. You had "train leaving the station" syndrome with Burning Crusade.
---
Massive disagree. TBC has excellent catch-up mechanics: The first four bosses in BT, the first boss in Hyjal, Zul'Aman, and the Sunwell patch all meant that startup guilds could fly through the older content. It was the best, most elegant progression strategy they had and it's tragic that they felt they needed to fix what wasn't broke.
---
I hate the new models on live. 
---
The move like garbage.
---
I’m really tied to the old wire frames and animations. I’m not married to the Vanilla version of VisKag when I know Blizzard updated it in wrath with the onyxia rerelease.
---
And that’s what I want, I want to Diablo 1, ScR, WC3 treatment (and hopefully one day d2). Not the cataclysm treatment.
---
Also all changes need to be toggled. I need to be able to see the game as if it were 2006 at anytime on the flick of a switch.
---
Did you quit playing in TBC? I feel like TBC was the best balance this game had in all aspects. You're looking at all the negative things about it, in like a super negative way. Pretty much everything you point out i disagree with. A lot of classic players liked TBC... even WotLK. QoL features werent as crazy as you think compared to everything after it. I guess if you like spending the VAST amounts of time running places, which im sure you will soon relearn and hate, then maybe youd hate summoning stones. But portals were only in Shat and the faction cities only ported you to Shat. What did you want to wait for a zep or ship to go? Why? 
---
I cant recall "faction servers" but i know there were some servers out there that were completely dominated by factions... I didnt know it was such a widespread problem as you make it though. Dailies were a QoL addition but they didnt really give you that much in terms of gold or rep so it still was a grind to get what you wanted. 
---
Resilience I agree with but flying mounts? Only usable in Outlands and it took a lot to get epic flying, maybe even more than getting epic riding back in vanilla, so it was still a challenge. 
---
And of course previous content was no longer as much as a challenge, show me one mmo that hasnt come out with an expansion doing the same. No reason to get all up in arms about that fact. Plus you still needed 15-20 man raid groups to even clear 60 raid content, even more so for Naxx. 
---
I dont know why or what made you hate it so much, maybe the loss of needing a giant guild, but it was a solid expansion. Probs the best WoW has ever had. I could go into the positives you overlooked but this seems too long already and its a matter of opinion.
---
Yes, when people want to retardedly go with the “hurrr durrr if you want no changes then that means you want all the bugs right?!?”
---
Yeah, the only issue for me is the release of classic corresponds with my seasonal side job, so sadly I wont have much free time until after Halloween. :(
---
To be fair, you can make a lot more gold/hour at higher levels. So going for xp/hour in the first twenty levels or so when you have little bag space, to more quickly get to the levels where you can afford a full set of vendor bags, might get you more gold *and* xp in the long run.
---
It would certainly be difficult to make it worse than TBC.
---
It's a matter of demand of course, can't satisfy everyone, but the demand for at least TBC and wrath IS there. And who's talking about having different versions at the same time? I'm suggesting that classic gets upgraded to TBC and so on.
---
Even if it had no gear drops whatsoever, I would still love it. Absolute favorite dungeon of all time.
---
I agreed with you.
---
Literally not a single one of these numbers are even remotely close to what will actually happen.
---
Idk. where you got your illusions from, but most people don't care a lot about PvP. A LOT of people care about PvE (where WotF is completely useless).
---
You know what these people will play? Alliance. You know why? Paladins and Dwarf Priests. You know what a lot of your horde buddies will play? Tauren Warriors. Why? Because they wanna tank.
---
And also, I am looking forward to destroy your "well informed rogue" with my Human Warlock. I don't need fear to take out chars played by people who believe they figured out the game, and then write such nonsense.
---
thanks for the hope! hope ill get it this time...
---
I don't think it's that surprising given its 1.12.  Have a feeling we'll see a lot less on PvE servers as well.
---
no it doesnt, no pom pyro no death coil, that didnt represent lv 60 pvp but i see what you're saying
---
So yeah, how does a pally fly through the air with his shield forward?
---
Just wanted to add that I played how you explained and it was about a thousand times better. Was on the edge with lock, but now its 100%. Shadowbolt was just too long to be casting, and searing/drain life is much, much better. Thank you again.
---
I agree. But this still was a cool moment for me. I think the main thing I take away from this video is that Blizzard needs to work on live servers. I have seen live servers crash with less then 200 people and that sucks.
---
I am just saying that \#nochanges doesn't mean shit at this stage.
---
You can't go \#nochanges but incorporated bnet on PVP server is okay, or can you?
---
For me thats definitely a \#change
---
Wait, do you think TBC was a bad expansion? I mean sure flying had some heavy repercussions but other than that the expansion was pretty damn good!
---
That was BC reeeee
---
Well, sub 30 getting to the other end of the world to a zone without any quests for your faction isnt going to be worth it or easy.
---
Now 30 to 40 its contested zones where everyone will be anyways. No reason not to just got ruin a streamer's day in world pvp if they are 3 minutes away.
---
I think you underestimate how many of those odd items there were. Even some level 60 epics were very good for a very long time in TBC. Most of those 60 epics that actually were good had a TBC epic that came from questing that was very close to it.
---
No, I'm of the opinion that they weren't. But, that's fine then. The idea being that new raids should be more mechanically complex, but not require the power creep that comes from a level cap increase. Vanilla did a great job of keeping old raids relevant with things like legendaries and quest chains which necessitated revisiting old raids.
---
Hey look. More dumb shit. Gonna also complain we arnt using old internet connections or eating the same diet as well? Use your brain. Be realistic.
---
Just lol'd at work imagining bubbled Leeroy running past the screen swarmed by whelps
---
Oh i ill live with it, but i will defy it =)
---
I've made tons of female characters and it seems like a good idea at the time... then a few weeks later when I hit the level cap I always regret it. 
---
I've learned my lesson now. No more female characters for me.
---
i found some really good money making grind spot around 24-26 and grinded inorder to buy 4 14 slot bags since i very early one got that more bag space = more loot to sell = more money.
---
an other aspect that is ignored with the bags is you could resell the 14 slot bags or hand them down. this gives classic a sort of soft reduction in diffculity in a small way. and it also means when you upgraded to be the bad ass with a 18 slot bag and 16 slot bags you can get your money back on that investment.
---
Horde has things like a base in STV, the zepplin system which is far superior to the boat system, and you can access all of their cities/starting zones pretty easily from each other. Darnassus being where it is is a huge pita.
---
Its good in terms of raids (I think the 5 mans are worse than the vanilla ones) , I like the attunements and even the reputation system.
---
But as a "world" of warcraft, I think the world aspects takes a heavy hit in TBC.
---
You are weird
---
People get upset cause they where trying to honor someone that passed away and it was a kinda shitty thing to do.
---
Swords are the best itemized weapon class in vanilla and is on basically every BiS list for each raid. Sword skill applies to both rogues and warriors for racials as well, while for horde it’s just warriors and casino shaman.
---
I don’t know if any axes are truly bis for warriors even without sword or axe skill racials factored in. Feel free to link me some if I’m wrong through.
---
You’re probably right. If I was concerned about that I would worry about it. Not saying it’s bad to play that way. It’s not. I just play it like I would any other game.
---
A "good" guild will never take a spriest to a raid. Dunno what all these other people are talking about but clearly no experience of current meta.
---
Warlocks are ridiculous in PVP and pretty good in PVE, summoning and soul shards are annoying af though.
---
Mages are the best overall class in the game.
---
Where's the warcraft movies icon Haha
---
Ha ha ha...
---
Oh yeah
---

---
I don't even understand you people, its literally a fucking custom version of 1.12.1, and you are still babbling your nonsense \#nochanges 'argument' as if its means anything at all.
---
So what you should call it is something like "vanilla design" or something of that manner, instead of spewing shit as if Blizzard isn't or haven't already implemented changes.
---
Why....  whyyyyyyy!!!!   And why did I keep reading?!
---
(Some of those responses though, topkek.)
---
"My name is (not) Earl"
---
Two piece is not needed, these days people use a trinket from zg (reduces chance to miss by 10%)
---
3000x easier eh? It surely wont be as easy when it goes live, but it wont be that hard and therefore some people may prefer it over searching / fighting for quest mobs.
---
You can take a secondary proff to cover costs, but if you are a warlock, farming is pretty easy.
---
Biggest money maker: Herbalism. Hands down herbalism will always be money. Potions, elixirs, flasks are always money. Having herbalisk means you can always go hunting for herbs, even while in queue.
---
Skinning is another one which is super easy money, while not as fast selling as herbs, hunting something like devilsaurs can be huge money. (And not that difficult to solo as a warlock)
---
Enchanting is expensive (the mats are expensive) but is a gold generator once leveled, and requires no gathering profession to level. (Since itself is a gathering profession) And people will always be after an enchanter, especially if you have some of the powerful enchants.
---
Alchemy can be useful to have as a secondary, but requires some kind of herbalist to fuel for gold generation. Most people who are after alchemy goods, generally aren't going to buy the herbs, as they are many times more expensive than the end product.
---
So the long story short, enchanting is good money generation, mining can be useful (but is usually pretty flooded), which means you can always have all of your materials you need. As well as Enchanting is a good gold generator once you have invested in it, and requires no other input.
---
SIDENOTE: Warlocks are great farmers, you may not even need a secondary profession to help. 
---
I played a warlock back in classic, pvped up to rank 9 (rolled a druid, took it to rank 13), loved engineering, had herb with it.  Always farmed herbs during queue times.  I queued from org -&gt; flew to felwood and farmed there while I was in queue. (Alliance, queue from SW -&gt; fly to blasted lands and farm around the dark portal)
---
what does no changes have to do with 1.13 being released after Naxx is on farm? Adding lets say 2 raids and 1 new zone for level 60 is less of a change than going from 1.12 to TBC. Because lets face it, if classic wow is a success Blizzard is going to do something to expand the project after people are done farming Naxx and the servers start to die out. And if thats the case 1.13 is a better idea than TBC is
---
It is in the beta so one may assume it will be in Classic as well.
---
rekt beyond words. what happened to crying about horde?
---
If they did that, they'd have to merge all Vanilla-only players into one realm. Which is exactly what I think will happen.
---
"All realms will be pushed to 2.0.1 on X date, you have until that date to transfer your character to this Vanilla-Only realm for free, after this date, transfers to the realm will be permanently blocked. Transfers back to a TBC realm are allowed."
---
"The real game" clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-yRVtNBuI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=564
---
From memory, it was attack power, which I think carried over to both.
---
Someone else who played an orc can correct me if I am wrong. Whenever I saw hunters, they were always orc.
---
Would love to see high level dungeons and raids in this quality! Tirisfal glades gave me goosebumps. Amazing
---
That's so interesting. Is there a book about specifically the undead priests?
---
Ya, it had us going to a different world but that new world felt just as alive and dangerous as the old one. I personally think TBC was the epitamy of WoW experience. Vanilla is great, TBC is amazing, WOTLK was good, past that shit starts falling off heavily.
---
At this point we're past the "Yeah but we gave feedback in BFA beta but they didn't use it" phase. Its clear they're using the feedback. Hope to see no more of that sentiment around here, which I had seen in the past.
---
Engineering item, I believe
---
Honestly it does just seem like really passionate and skilled players go horde, which accounts for success in both pve and PvP. I’m not sure why that is, but it’s interesting to see. Coordination and skill are definitely a factor in the big picture.
---
Imagine thinking blizzard can be trust to improve classic, your a special kind of stupid.
---
What if I'm all of those things?
---
Healers always have an easier time getting into raids.  DPS will be a dime a dozen.  Go priest.
---
Still does the same shit to your teeth
---
I'd say do both. 1.13 that is using TBC content. Hellfire remastered for lvl 60. 40 man Hellfire Citadel raid
---
How bad of a person do you have to be to ignore 50 people
---
respect the 1v1 bro.
---
I remember D E D = L O L  if you're horde talking to alliance.
---
I’ve never seen an xp bar like that before.
---
Why would they have to merge all classic servers into one? I was thinking more like they just have a separate set of servers for each and allow you to transfer or copy onto the TBC servers much like how PTR works.
---
&gt; different world
---
A tiny world and you put two full factions on one small continent = disaster. Flying guts wpvp, Horde is objectively the better faction so most people reroll if they haven't already done so in late vanilla, you never see raid groups actually running to raids because everyone gets summoned there. You have portals everywhere in Shattrath, and you spend most of your time just flying places, doing dailies and getting summoned around.
---
Pretty close to retail, and obviously WotlK is much worse, but TBC is still bad.
---
My son is now 10, and wasn't yet born during vanilla, but I've been training him in the ways of the force on a private server since classic was announced. 
---
He's decided he's rolling a gnome mage...
---
Guess I'm playing alliance now
---
Pretty much.
---
Playing beta with a macbook pro 15 touch id(2017) and it run smooth with mid graphic level, up lf that it does drop fps badly.
---
Showing content was against WoW Vanilla, watch every single trailer from 2004 and they never really showed us what we were fighting.
---
How many streamer fanbois will reroll on your chosen server?
---
Blizzard can only dream of having servers this stable.
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
In several senses the word "play", if the inclination is there.
---
Maybe.. don't harass streamers? And if people gang you report it as harassment. Everyone who messages you gets a 1 hour mute.
---
Y we yesyeyesyesyesye
---
&gt; I'd argue that it doesn't have to be balanced to reward stuff. There have been many arena seasons with totally broken op classes.
---
When you add a reward, you exponentially increase the calls for balance.  If there was a world-wide ranking system and elite PvP gear and special titles for 1v1 combat... then warlocks in Vanilla would get nerfed straight into the ground.  Those arena seasons with broken OP classes would then get those classes nerfed and normalized.
---
Were you around for the Prot-Healadin of WotLK?
---
I was.  And despite not really enjoying arena (was dragged there by a friend) I managed 2200 in 2v2.  Sometimes my partner would die and it'd take the remaining two enemies like 3 solid minutes to kill me.  The exception was with Priests, who could mana burn me to death.
---
This lead directly to Bliz deciding that you shouldn't be able to mix and match talent trees, because it was too hard to balance such a wide variety of abilities.  And now we have super simplistic classes that only get a few talant choices... but it's balanced!
---
Also, they eventually got rid of mana burn because it made Priests too special in small-group content.
---
Ranked/rewarded 1v1 combat would be horrible for the game, and I think that ranked/rewarded 2v2, 3v3, or even 5v5 combat would have the same effect for the same reasons.
---
Its effectively rolling on a fresh server in 2006. Still vanilla
---
Location of said ogres?
---
Why do people still think layering has anything to do with server stress?
---
It doesn't. It's to maintain Vanilla-like pop caps in starter zones during launch, while avoiding the problem of destructive server merges five months in.
---
Adding new content that was not there in Vanilla is changes. 
---
Classic wow is a success because it’s content that we have played before. Not because people want a new game they haven’t seen before. 
---
Guess what? If they release content after naxx, you know that turns classic into retail right?
---
Being avoidable or not is not what defines griefing in the slightest. Everything in game is avoidable if you are willing to go far enough.
---
Can't get stream sniped in SM xD
---
I'm intrigued, show one?
---
Another bullshit alliance advantage. You can’t start Warlords Command on Horde till 58
---
Yeah getting pissy will get people to take your point seriously
---
So in an either or scenario you'd rather replace your helm before your tanking rings/cape/neck got it
---
But weren't there PvP ranks you could obtain in 2006 while lvling? 
---
Oh yes, there was. But since we are doing a custom version of 1.12.1, there won't be. So it will be vanilla-like.
---
IDK what experience you had in TBC but I feel sorry for you. I had a blast, world pvp was still alive, I remained alliance and there was plenty of us to go around. If you think TBC is close to retail in any way shape or form, I have to question if you have actually played both. To each their own, your opinion is just as valid as mine but I question the roots of your opinion.
---
Yeah if those MoP players make noise they will.
---
Something tells me there isnt a big enough demand though
---
&gt;It has nothing to do with server stability.
---
Depends on the items everyone will pick up as well. Skull of impending doom might be possible, tidal charm is too. New engineering trinkets.
---
If you want to own in PVP go shadowpriest. Good lord....
---
So he levelled a new tank from 0-70 and completed the insanely long MH attunement in less than a week and successfully tanked MH in gear aquired
---
only from that ? Sounds fishy bro
---
I don't think I could disagree more with everything you just wrote.
---
This is how I also handled my old shifts.  Now I have a job that I find challenging and get joy out of figuring out something and doing it well.  I suggest if it is possible look for other alternatives of employment until you find what you enjoy.
---
I tried to complete this in the beta today and sadly it was bugged
---
WHEN!!!!! Please god LET ME IN!!!!
---
Dev's in the media day said "yea sure" but obviously that can change #blizzard. However this i feel has a very easy in game player solution. (how hard would it be for 3 level 60s to beat a Doomgaurd) cant be that difficult imo so i think the "damage" is pretty negligible. This shouldnt be considered griefing.
---
Looks like classic will be even more of a breeze than I thought.
---
Yep that's the idea! 
---
Getting a laptop with a video card and that'll be fine. We do have a laptop but I can barely run Tibia on it, so pretty shit. But yeah I sat down and talked with her and we'll be able to get one soon.
---
Crits or GTFO
---
You obviously haven’t played retail

You're overthinking things. Whichever faction has the most active/best guilds on a particular server will own the other in PVP. Anyone talking about how horde is going to own alliance or vice versa simply has no clue wtf they are talking about.

---
Warlocks don't need a ton of gear (less you are wanting to do the whole drakedog 1-shot destro).
---
There's two strategies: 1 - Burst your opponent. Destro type build. 2 - Fear dot drain.
---
With the first, your spell power, and spell crit will be really helpful, and will be critical for your power. Early on, you will still be able to deal huge damage, without a ton of spell power.
---
With the second strategy, spell power again is helpful, but you are using your multiple dots and CC power to your advantage. You can get away with mostly stam/int, and just stack dots while slowing your opponent (curse of exhaustion from affliction tree), and using fear to keep your opponent at a distance, while the dots slowly kill your opponent.
---
Warlocks are probably the least gear-dependent spellcaster in terms of pvp. You have a ton of strength in your CC, huge utility with your pets, and with DoT's, you aren't limited to just mashing one or two spells to kill someone.
---
(Warriors are very VERY hard for any caster to deal with, once they start to become geared, that's the nature of things! But you can still run over most warriors who are bad and zerker rage at the wrong time)
---
I'd be kind of shocked if they didn't, in order to capitalize on the likely hot sales it'd get.
---
As it is, to have some good nostalgia going (albeit from a different era, but one that's more relative to me at the age a lot of people were when they played WoW), I'm likely going to get some Surge to have on hand for the launch.
---
THRALL'S BALLS
---
I think Joana is going to do extremely well and probably make WR with his run.  He literally only speedruns games.  That's what he does.
---
10 man normal raids in Wrath were a joke.
---
This but d2 ladder reset not PoE
---
It was from vanilla (04-06). Ret Paly’s weren’t useless, they facilitate other activities!
---
I had been leaning toward Shaman, but after watching beta streams for various classes they just seem kinda.. Boring. Anyone that’s played one (and other classes) that can give me some insight?
---
i like mismatches sometimes - in this instance it looks like the riding clothes of a fairly well-off adventurer or something.  Her top, gloves, and shoulders are sort of fancy but the trousers and boots are all practicality!
---
considering how easy itll be to kill an infernal or doomguard, probably not. but it will get you on the server shit list if you annoy enough people with it

one suggestion made by crendor for retail is to remove the instant teleport to dungeons and raids if you que up insted you need to travel there and summon people. make the LFG and LFR tool a tool to find people to play with don't also make it a tool to instantly teleport the people to the dungeon who they can then kick people inorder to get an instant replacement teleported to the dungeon.
---
that barrier makes the people asking should you kick X actually think if they should insted of blindly agreeing.
---
a great thing about classic that isn't obvious is that it uses downtime in a really effectiv matter. there are some many lessions of the effects classics systems you could write a book about for game design.

---
1000 times yes
---
60min cd.
---
IF you summoned in AH or at Mailbox, it was greifing. if you summoned it where people could kill it in the open, it was ok.
---
Its intended game mechanics for the Doomguard to attack members of your own faction as well. It would be ridiculous for Blizzard to consider it improper behavior since that was how it was supposed to be in Vanilla and ppl weren't banned for it then.
---
Anything more than one time by the same person will be. 
---
This reminded me of the good ol pet bomb days.
---
Ignoring people that spam dumb shit will fill an ignore list pretty fucking fast.
---
People keep talking about how 3 60's can handle a doom gaurd. Now I'm just thinking... I need to get 100 warlocks together and open a straight up gateway to hell. 100 Doomies going deep on the capital. Thats not grieving thats a ballin ass saturday.
---
not really a difficult choice tbh
---
Not hard mode.  Rewards were the same.
---
What about o o g a
---
Take it easy tiger :D
---
I was Horde back in vanilla. Tauren Hunter. Indoor Kids was my main raiding guild, before we became pN..  Funny how both horde and alliance all went to Argent Dawn to troll when Blackrock was down. Those queues were unbelievably long
---
Thats a very personal request though, I just want to relive Vanilla warts and all. I’ll be pissed if Blizzard starts “balancing” the game in any way. They’ve been balancing shit on live for 15 years and everything seems ok now.. (/s) also all of the original designers for WoW are gone. Its easy to say “redesign TBC with Classics vision” but the people who had those visions aren’t there anymore.. the people who would be in charge are the exact same people who fucked up the current WoW..
---
Im not 100% nochanges but god damned you guys are making me want it more and more.
---
Weird...some streamer does something and multiple people need to rush here to spam the stream.
---
I remember liking the blue flavor more but buying the red anyway because FOR THE HORDE!!!!
---
Just hate it, that's all. Then again I hate gnomes for being part of the warcraft universe. Without them alliance might have been an option, who knows.
---
You just got in to Beta?
---
Sporebat.  You learn other skills from sporebat.  Worship sporebat.  Love sporebat.
---
This is the kind of shenanigans I love about MMOs.
---
Wow Classic Hype has already shit the bed.    This game will last all of six months tops..  if that.
---
all about sexy graphics, the problem would be them making some retarded animations like on live
---
Classic is finished if it is
---
The players react to the circumstances they are in. The players base aggregated at level 30, and so when the level cap was raised, it was like a level 1 Zerg all over again. Hiding in dungeons was the most efficient option.
---
The teleporter unit near the Inn. Talk to the undead guy.
---
\&gt; [Uther the Lightbringer](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Uther_Lightbringer)  performed a ceremony to strip Tirion of his powers and sent him home to  gather some supplies. However, as a last token of respect to his  friend, Uther did not exile Tirion's family for his crime.  
---
Uther only performed the ceremony, he didn't pass the sentence.
---
I never said that. I said that the set bonuses provide very little threat and will almost never influence your choice. You wear ony neck because its a good threat piece for a tank, just like LH Helm. Not because it lets you keep a set bonus. Your post is misleading as it implies the set bonuses are valuable and drive gear choices.
---
It would have been much better if we could have had someone with the dissenting opinion on it, but unfortunately nobody with that opinion was around when he needed to record the call to get it on the show.
---
Hahah same, minus the wife :(
---
If you are using Mac Products you are a major part of the problem. 
---
Wake up.  you are being Milked
---
He was complaining about how useless heroic dungeons are in BfA and how it's stupid that by the time you can do them the gear is already close to irrelevant. Seems like a pretty valid complaint to me.
---
The undead guy not far outside the Inn (near a teleport pod-looking thingie)
---
It’s not about the mobs. Not really.
---
It’s exactly about getting in a group. 
---
I can level in bfa alone, ignoring other people and achieve everything. 
---
In vanill, people killing mobs matters to me—now I have to wait. People taking nodes before me means I don’t get them. 
---
When I’m in an outdoor dungeon (oxymoron?) and someone else is there doing his own thing clearing some of the mobs it makes that escort imma about to do easier
---
Gnomeregan belongs to category 1 : just don't like it...
---
That would be ridiculous! She used to play priest and to my surprise (she was a brand new player, never ever played an MMO and on a certain pserver) and versus me, a mage, and a long time WoW player, would whip my ass or would get very close. She is wanting to play lock this time around so maybe I can get my revenge!
---
They would struggle just as much as the retail team. 
---
Classic is just such a smaller and simpler game than retail.
---
Do not schedule such an important thing such as school around a fucking video game. Take more classes in the fall and graduate early.
---
Trust me. I know from experience.

&gt; Also they can play in uncontested zones all the way up until about level 30, whereas Alliance has to enter a contested territory at about 20.
---
Are you sure that you can level up from 1-30 in just two zones? (Mulgore/Durotar + The Barrens). Genuinely curious, because I never played classic.
---
&gt; Horde has things like a base in STV
---
Yeah I have to admit that the base in STV is pretty huge.
---
&gt; And you can access all of their cities/starting zones pretty easily from each other.
---
But you can do the same thing with the Alliance? Elwynn Forest and Dun Morogh are basically connected thanks to the SW and IF train and to get to Darnassus you just have to fly to Menethil Harbor from IF and take the boat, right?
---
Mage or Warlock?
---
I played vanilla as a young teenager and rolled a mage. I have less time to play as an adult and would primarily like to PvE raid while also enjoying PvP even if it is suboptimal for whatever spec/build I choose for raiding.
---
I really enjoyed AoE grinding/farming as a mage but would also like to try out soloing elite content as a warlock.
---
Any update on the release?
---
Yeahhhh as a Canadian I don't think so.
---
Wait, alliance don't get zeppelins? Oof.
---
I was resto druid in TBC. Raided with a guild called Six Pack
---
Iirc they were if it was extended. Say a 48 hour period straight in goldshire. Maybe it was later than vanilla idk.
---
NE warrior best ally warrior race for tanking ayyy (sweet sweet dodge)
---
Looking forward to play a mage in classic.
---
I've just realised i was 3 yo when you started playing
---
that's just
---
WOW
---
this game is nearly as old as i am
---
Back in the day on retail I never got close to 50, but on every pserver I've played on it didnt take long to get there.
---
I am in favor of allowing people to troll others in the game. Getting your wittle duel tournament disrupted is not in breach of the ToS and streamers shouldn't be getting special treatment regardless. Blizzard should not be picking winners and losers. What applies to normal, non-streamer players should apply to streamers too.
---
Confirmed to work with classic?
---
I uh, I collect shirts and tabards, my Retail Druid still has shirts and tabards from Vanilla and it pisses me off they removed the "Made by" tag...
---
Good luck with your obesity
---
1. Priest
---
2. Fury warrior tank
---
3. Mage/warlock interchangeable really. Basically trading some utility and CC for another. You don’t need that much CC in the lower dungeons but it is nice to have. 
---
4. Shaman is great for more than just totems, but mana spring is nice to have. You’ll want them to be enhancement if you don’t want loot competition since the majority of mail gear is going to lack int and SP, or at least a good chunk will.
---
5. Rogue without question at this point. Wind fury buff from shaman, high DPS, humanoid CC, plus stuns for mobs. Also nice to have him for lock picking if you loot a lockbox. 
---
This eliminates the most competition for loot. As the priest you’ll still battle the mage/lock. Personally, I would go warlock over mage since the damage can go either way based on skill. Soul stones/health stones and seduction from the succubus versus vending machine, sheep, int buff. Summoning portal is nice, too.
---
With the warlock this also eliminates most of the need for walk backs(especially for dungeons like BRD.) Soul stone the priest/shaman for the rez in case the shaman doesn’t want to burn a reincarnation.
---
Or does it...
---
I've done a lot of griefing in wow and I've been reported a lot of times and had gms contact me and I've never once stopped what I was doing or been punished in any way.  Any time a gm messaged me I roleplayed him into submission.   I have no idea how it will be now but back in the day as long as you used role playing as an excuse you could get away with anything.  In bc I did a 12 hour long wsg because I grabbed the flag and refused to turn it in.  About 4 hours in a gm contacts me and I told him I was bringing the horde and alliance together in peace and that capping the flag was an act of hatred and he left me alone.  People were pissed because the only way to get out was to get the deserter debuff or kill me and I wasn't dying because at that point the horde was essentially a or made of people who wanted to graveyard camp the alliance indefinitely.
---
A screenshot of the convo with the gm was on top of some wow image sharing site for a few years but I think it's probably lost to the ages now.
---
A targeted effort of multiple warlocks gets around this.
---
I might be wrong but the only item from vanilla which wasn't immediately replaceable from TBC raids was Thunderfury and that was only due to the innate threat generated by its proc. As I said the only reason to wear green items at this stage was if it had some super unique effect such as boosting movement speed. BT progression didn't start untill 5 months into tbc
---
I think it's more like this sub has slowly become a bit of a cult and I think we just found the kool-aid.
---
This is what I wanted to happen. Give the Classic enthusiasts a master piece to play for the next 10 years.
---
what the fuck even is this thread, maybe it's time to put the crack pipe down OP.
---
Play the game however you want lads.
---
Tbf the 50s are a real slog, I can see how folks get stuck there.
---
Didn't Esfand test this just earlier and it was working?
---
No it's not. It's PvP on PvP server. Whether or not you or I agree with the streamers doing it is irrelevant, it should be allowed because that's the nature of the game.
---
Maydie
---
Do guards attack the doomguard? If so i don't think even the AH would be A problem.
---
Pretty much /thread then.
---
Who the fuck cares. A doomguard an hour per warlock is a meme. A doomguard every 5 seconds is griefing.
---
That warlock was pure trash.

Swwet! I'll remember that! Thanks mate
---
Let him know the potential problems with the spec, but ultimately it has to be his decision.  All you can do is ensure he's making an informed one.
---
I'll be leveling as enhancement and am trying to figure out the best way I can contribute to a raid group as one.  It currently looks like totem twisting is the winner, largely because so many personal dps options are unviable for one reason or another and/or require too many talent points to be really worth it.
---
But I'll also be putting a lot of points into resto, because it has good mana talents and also so I can heal decently if I need to.  As much as I think the buffs make enhancement well worth a group/raid spot, I do want an alternative for when either others won't be convinced or when extra healing is genuinely needed.  It's important to be willing and able to compromise when bringing a less accepted spec.
---
DME duo farm, especially if you have enchanting.
---
Can probably do Strat Live reserving first orb.
---
Female undead rogue is the best rogue.
---
Best bet is grouping if you want combat farming. But would recommend herb/alch for making money as you don't really need to kill anything. Plus flasks are $$$
---
These are BC screenshots not Vanilla as I didn't save many screenshots from Vanilla at all.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/wtrNiVg](https://imgur.com/a/wtrNiVg)
---
I really thought these were the best interfaces ever.
---
DME boss farming with a fury warrior or sword rogue is the best method. It requires mining, enchanting(1/300 is fine) and optionally herbalism. Basically you kill 3-4 bosses and do a bit of aoe then mine some veins at the end. It's very good gold some of the best you can make and you can do it in healing spec. Here's a guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto&amp;
---
I still have the robot mini pet that came with it, so yes pls he is thirsty
---
/r/HydroHomies
---
Be sure to pick up imp life tap, and to use drain life often, keeps downtime low while leveling warlock.
---
Also forgot about second question.
---
&gt;  enhance shaman, feral druid, or priest of some sort
---
I am biased sorry, I played feral for too many years, including during classic. I LOVED playing feral in pvp, mostly on small scale. In larger groups, and serious high end structured pvp, ferals tend to fall a bit more flat, where healing is much more important.
---
But for small scale, ferals can be gods. You don't normally burst someone down as a feral, you are bleeding someone to death and slowly outplaying them. It really magnifies who is the better player. When there's more decisions to make, there's more room for errors to be made, and the better player will make less.
---
Also most classes aren't able to last in a drawn out fight.
---
I used to run with a really good rogue back in classic, we used to camp some choke points in blackrock spire and 2vXed, groups going to UBRS were our favorite. There would be clumps of 3-7 people coming in and we would take out 1-2 people, run away, re-stealth and re-engage after healing/manaing myself up.
---
As well, for WSG you WANT a Feral/Resto FC. They are super fast, immune to most CC's, and can escape from sticky situations.
---
Now for enhance shamans, they are VERY VERY gear dependent. If you watch ye-olde unbreakable video. Super geared, 1-shot people but is really rare that that happens. It's a pretty boring playstyle, mostly auto attacks. There is no dual wielding for shamans in classic (sadly).
---
Priest, don't have a ton of experience, they have some great use in pvp, shadow I didn't see many of, I think they are akin to warlocks in a lot of respects, with more power transferred over to their healing instead of their offense. I remember just one shadowpriest being in our WSG premade team on occasion, but there was ALWAYS 1-2 warlocks. They saved my fluffy butt more times than I could count, peeling for me as I was booking it across midfield with enemies in tow.
---
Why do the Warlock Pets in Drakedog videos have a happiness meter? Is that just a Korean thing?
---
People spend 10x longer to get to an even average level of skill in any of those games as they would to get to level 60 in Classic. Hell, it takes on average 150 games to get to level 30 in League of Legends which is around 4 days of played time after factoring in matchmaking, loading, and post game time with 30 min average game time. Not significantly different than getting to max level in Classic and getting to lv 30 in LoL doesn't mean shit.
---
&gt; players of the same faction who are egregiously disrupting a widely organized activity with no intention of contributing.
---
Is not griefing, and it can be mitigated via in-game defensive measures via PvP from the opposing faction.
---
As a warlock main in vanilla, I loved Warlocks for PvP. I hated it for raids because of the fact that you ended up summoning so many lazy people. There always seemed to be a few people that "couldn't get there on time." Collecting soul shards can be annoying as they take up inventory slots.
---
Healer on Horde side; Tauren Druid, Orc shaman, or Undead priest? 
---
How does leveling and endgame raiding compare between them?
---
No, good guilds will take 1. 15% more shadow damage my man
---
Raiding as either is pretty balanced. Mage you are hammering frost bolt, warlock you are hammering shadowbolt.
---
Warlocks you are  cookie vending machines. Mage you are food/mana vending machines.
---
Mages are slightly more damage, but both are pretty on par.
---
Echoing this, go healer.
---
Not sure who said holy but they're wrong. The reason Shadow w/ wand spec is so efficient is because you never run out of mana and can pull constantly, the DPS is not much lower than hardcasting and with Priests utility you can easily handle a couple of mobs at a time when required. The amount of time you lose by stopping to drink between pulls is enormous.
---
Also you might just be being flippant but I would say missing 10% spell hit, 15% shadow damage and 20% range is certainly missing out on a lot.
---
Priest. It's always cake getting a slot as healer.
---
Hey there. Saw your LFG post, wanted to shill our guild. We are [Hero Association], its a guild formed by a bunch of real life friends (of which i am not one, haha, but i am one of the officers) - its a friendly guild that doesnt go hardcore, but still plans to consistently clear content. One of my personal regrets in original vanilla was not seeing enough content - even though i later caught up and went to be pretty well progressed with multiple server firsts -  so i will most definitely be trying to push towards strong progression - although we will still focus on a laid back atmosphere. The raid times are 20:30-23:30 UK time (so 21:30-00:30 server time), although days are unconfirmed yet (at least 3 days though). We will be on EU PVE servers. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions - and i could give you a discord invite!
---
I always wanted “What’s a Nerubian”,but figured too oscure and abstract maybe.
---
Hey guys, Hobbs here.
---
Uh what I cant agree.  I think you are seriously underestimating the effect this game will have on the market
---
I was actually wondering if they'd do this again the other day
---
World defense chat was the ultimate troll by locking out people below rank 11 lol
---
&gt; No. You'll be playing on a higher difficulty setting unavailable to PVEasy players. If you're the kind of gamer that accepts every challenge, then PVP is for you, regardless of your playstyle.
---
Haha, no. I played on PvP servers from vanilla until WoD. PvP servers are never more difficult.
---
The reality of PvP servers is that no one actually attacks someone else unless they're 99% sure they're going to win because they out-level, out-gear, or out-number the other party. Every other case they don't engage or just run away if they think they'll lose.
---
So either you're stomping someone, or getting stomped on. In either case there is no actual difficulty, just the wasted time of a corpse run if you're on the losing side.
---
Nope. We get a boat going from Menethil in wetlands to Darkshore. We also get a tram going between stormwind and ironforge, but that's only needed once. In order to get between SW/IF and Darnassus, you have to go to menethil and wait for the boat every time instead of the boat being, like, right outside stormwind.  
---
Also we don't have the benefit of having a boat to STV either. Also, horde has a boat in Ratchet that goes to Booty Bay...
---
Your argument was “current gaming trends” I argued that their is no change in gaming trends from a consumer perspective in the last 2 decades. Just not any evidence of that at all. 
---
Fast paced lobby games have been popular before, during, and after the success of WoW. That is a constant variable in the decline of MMORPGs. It’s the design of the games that lead to its decline not imaginary “gaming trends”.
---
For example if I were selling ice cream and the business next door was selling sushi were both very successful, so I get greedy and decided I wanted to try and get some of his customers too. I decide to shift my product from ice cream to sushi flavored ice cream. At first I get a bunch of new customers wanting to try it then I steadily lose my customer base. It would be absurd to come to the conclusion that people don’t want ice cream anymore, the reality is they don’t want sushi flavored ice cream. This is exactly what happened with world of Warcraft post TBC, they tried to bring in a different demographic and alienated the one they had.
---
&gt;And the MMOs that are on the market, have gone towards more quicker paced gameplay.
---
This is exactly my point. They are far less successful because of it.
---
&gt;Hence why Classic Everquest isnt seeing as much excitement for Classic WoW.
---
Everquest never saw the success wow did so this would be expected, classic WoW is is a far superior product we know that. The RS3 to OSRS is a much better example. The old school version of the game grew bigger than any version of runescape ever, even those RS3 followed those exact “gaming trends” of fast paced free loot gameplay.
---
"Spikes on everything" is aesthetic to you?? Bro do you even cathedral of light
---
Can us Bois that don't fuck with sugar get a diet gamer fuel? I'm all for the fake cancer giving sugar.
---
Those juicy arms crits!
---
I mained warlock in vanilla but my alt was a Shaman. I enjoyed it but I almost always got stuck healing. You'll have a hard time getting taken seriously, for the most part, as enhancement. Elemental can be good but requires the gear. Their scaling is insane though. If you love PvP, it can be a blast. You're amazing for WSG as a flag runner.
---
&gt; Warriors really ain't that bad to require hardcore style play, but they definitely do level very slowly solo.
---
To build on this, warriors have harsh downtime while leveling (lack of healing ability). As well warriors are very gear reliant, so keeping your weapon current is very important.
---
Rage gen also sucks, so you are using a lot of auto attacks to kill stuff.
---
Im undecided on faction, what do you guys think of Horde vs Alliance in terms of choosing?
---
Yeah rogue beats SL.
---
I don't know what to say other than, that legitimately sucks, lol. Thanks for the in depth answer.
---
Mitigation: Point your camera down when you fall, problem solved.
---
This has been in the game for 15 years, and the same thing applies. If you aim your camera down (right-click, as if you were pointing your character's direction) you will not walk on the surface (or collide with it as it relates to falling) and instead will pass through it, as the game thinks your intention is to swim downward.
---
Water walking trolling (and later on, Path of Frost trolling) when falling from great heights into water has taught me to always aim my camera down, for this very reason.
---
No, good guilds *might* take a disc priest healer who is specced into Shadow Weaving to keep the buff up for their Warlocks. They also might not because the difference is negligible depending how many Warlocks are in the raid. A good guild will NEVER take a Shadow Priest.
---
Healers are often more needed. For higher end things, you need to be well geared to be a MT or OT. Healers can almost always find a slot, even without the best gear.
---
How are Hunters in PvP? I played a bit during the stress test and it seemed really fun. I played rogue in vanilla and looking for a similar experience in Classic, but not the same.
---
&gt;The first quest is based on a 20% drop rate of quest items and may take someone 45 minutes to an hour to this quest once. The second quest is based on killing a set number of mobs in Winterfall Village. The third quest is also based on killing a set number of mobs, but they are extremely hard Elite Giants and they are located on the other side of the map in Frostwhisper Gorge.
---
&gt;All three quests give the same amount of reputation and the second one is by far the fastest, so you can decide which one to repeat. Assuming the quest takes you about 15 minutes to complete (including  going back and forth to drop it off), it would take you a total of 210 real hours to do the quest 840 times. That is about nine days by itself, and seeing as how no one can play for nine days continuously doing this, it will take you months to get it (personally it took me a  little over 2 months doing it every single day).
---
&gt;Yes you also have to learn the Tiger Riding ability from Darnassus to ride this mount, Rivern does not teach it to you. That means if you're not Night Elf, you have to get Exalted with Darnassus before you can purchase and learn Tiger Riding.
---
Damn son.
---
5-mans - Warriors are really REALLY needed. Don't really need to be prot for the majority of the time, but it helps.
---
Healers are always really important to the raid, and are always sought after, and have more spots in the raid.
---
&gt; you will be spit out and chewed up
---
huh... never seen it in that order before
---
you're pretty high strung for a dude who "loves his buds"
---
MC, ZG, AQ20, and onyxia. Are easy once you got BiS and learn the simple mechanics.
---
I actually have no idea what they’re doing. Literally every streamer is spamming SM like a complete mongoloid.
---
How so?
---
There are more people in the beta than streamers on the front page. Me being one of them. Quit your bitching.
---
Stratholme orb runs.
---
Mage will most likely be your best starting point. They are rather cost effective with being able to make your own food/water, they can AOE farm and you can teleport people for cash.
---
30-45 as Alliance fucking sucks. The main instance you run is SM which means you gotta travel on foot from South Shore all the way up north past a horde fucking capitol city and run into a bottle neck of an entrance where horde completely control if they want to push your shit in or not.
---
Sinister Strike can proc your sword specialization which in return resets your swing timer so you should always use it right after your main hand auto hits. Eviscerate shouldn't proc it though.
---
It's faster to go through Ashenvale and STM for the quests, but if you don't mind grinding or going a little slower so you don't get ganked, yes you can get up to like 28-30 just in the starting zones/barrens.
---
Yes, you can just fly to menethil and take the boat, but I'd say it's a tougher run for lower levels. If you're a tauren, you can get to Org pretty easily without running into mobs. If you're a night elf trying to get to Ironforge, you have to go through tunnels full of level 20+ mobs. It isn't a big deal at later levels, but if you want to travel at lower levels, Horde defintiely has it easier, imo.
---
The wetlands run is famous for a reason.
---
&gt;Those arena seasons with broken OP classes did end up getting those classes nerfed and normalized, after all...
---
That's true. But those changes could have come from PvE as well.
---
&gt; Also, they eventually got rid of mana burn because it made Priests too special in small-group content.
---
They got rid of viper sting and the warlock drain as well no? It wasn't priest specific. They just didn't want the mana burn mechanic in the game, too unfun I guess?.
---
&gt;Ranked/rewarded 1v1 combat would be horrible for the game, and I think that ranked/rewarded 2v2, 3v3, or even 5v5 combat would have the same effect for the same reasons.
---
That could be true, I honestly don't know. I just don't see how it can be that horrible? They would either just not balance it, or  do some slight balance adjustment(with extensive testing).
---
Yes. 100%, and I would do it today if such an opportunity were afforded.
---
Well, if you’re not wanting to play a shaman or paladin, then it comes down to aesthetics. Which races do you like more? Which Capital Cities would you preferred to spend your time in?
---
I always found it way more fun to see your guild plant Onyxia's head in the middle of your city... not doing repetitive, menial tasks while getting called "champion" every 7 seconds. I'm so sick of that shit.
---
Horde is slightly easier to level and is more focused on PvP. Alliance has a few lulls in quests but is superior in PvE. Alliance will also have instant BG queues on most servers for this reason. Also the classic if you want to play shaman -&gt; horde, paladin -&gt; alliance.
---
2019 baby!
---
and and NFL players are just the worst lol
---
Honestly a 20 minute replacement would spectacular. Unless you've got someone on your friends list ready to go you're looking at quite a bit longer.
---
It wasn't ally only, it was contested (Winterspring) on a PvP-enabled server.
---
hows it goin?
---
The dungeons are significantly easier than on private servers and people are worried that this will carry over to raiding.
---
&gt; Am I mad for thinking of going Druid over my usual dwarf priest?
---
YES YOU ARE! HOW IS THIS ANY KIND OF CONTEST!? DRUID ALL THE WAY! (Okay I am bias but still)
---
Druids aren't tank healers, as such they don't have the throughput the priests or paladins have. But they are still able to cure curses (which many raids have), which frees up mages to not have to waste that precious GCD.
---
Druids have what no other class has, a battle rez. As such having 2-3 per raid isn't a bad idea. Especially as we go late into content, the ability to (somewhat) AOE heal is nice (by tossing hots on people).
---
Priests are super common, but druids... they are very rare. (ESPECIALLY A GOOD ONE!)
---
As an Undead Warlock main in vanilla, only the dwarf priest was annoying. Stoneform and fear ward are beast to have. Night Elf Shadow priest can be fun with shadow meld ganks though.
---
Why thank you sir
---
Honestly all VE does is waste a debuff slot and hurt your damage potential as it generates healing threat. Aside from mana issues threat is one of the other major shadow priest problems.
---
Venruki and his Team just cleared SM Armory in 3 pulls, id say thats some fair beta testing tbh...
---
Hey kid get over yourself. We are drama free and noone of my irl friend is evenofficer. Stop your BS if you dont know ppl and stop guessing.
---
I reckon I prefer alliance races as a whole, and their cities. But at the same time, I really like Tauren individually.
---
Do what you want. No hunter race is flat out bad. Stomp can be amazing for getting out of the dead zone as well.
---
This is similar to how the older iteration of the system worked; you put in what/where you were looking for and a list of names came up. 
---
In 3.3 they changed it to what we have today.
---
Pvp no matter how it happens—as unavoidable as it is—is not griefing.
---
The paper would need to use safespotting or another game breaking mechanic for it to be griefing.
---
Level 7s should lose to level 60s if both are flagged. That is the game working as intended.
---
This isn't a EULA debate, it's just bad for class/faction fantasy to allow communication. You will learn what 'bur' is the old fashioned way.
---
Getting to Menethil Harbor is easier than you think. You don't even have to go through Loch Modan, You can climb over Dun Morogh and just jump to your death and you'll be able to get rez sick from the Spirit Healer near Menethil Harbor.
---
was that all mages?
---
But these things WILL happen within the first month, gotta temper expectations of the masses :)
---
It's still just a more flavorful version of spawn camping, which has existed for time immemorial in online games.
---
While it's definitely under the umbrella of griefing, what games actually enforce bans for it? None that I can think of.
---
yo it actually works the other way....
---
Your kidding? I was just watching the BWL trailer and its literally a player frapsing raid footage.. you can see a Priest jumping around in the background behind Nefarion lol. Then it cuts to Nef encounter in a raid.
---
OP's post is silly and all, but he's vaguely correct about Undead. Undead are the most popular Horde race on pservers, along with their Human counterparts for Alliance, as you can see on a website I can't link directly because of Automod, but it's called Vanilla Radar. There are nearly 50% more Undead than there are Orcs.
---
I'm not in beta and haven't played retail since MoP, but I'll probably have something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/mkNQRKL). I deleted my old screenshot folder, so I can't post up a fuckton of even older UIs. :c
---
Are enhancement shamans also better at carrying Nightfall than most, or is it just whatever class?
---
Look at the meta shit perp has to go to to beat a warlock, and the gear is restricted to r14 bwl to prevent locks from getting out of hand.
---
Completely agree. Cheap retexturing and modification of existing assets is the go to strategy for these gaming companies that have gone public (and apparently Bethesda now?). 
---
Gotta get something to push out the door asap in order to appease shareholders for the next quarter.
---
There simply isn't enough time to develop a new, in depth game from a lot of these companies. They just throw the same shit rebranded out with additional strategies for them to rake in as much money as they can. Not much creativity any more.
---
Nah there will be rogues that go mining and herb loololol
---
24 gold? My man is rich!
---
I am keen on trying a feral druid but I see, it requires this awkward, shifting play-style and I'm concerned my 220ms that I'll get on the European servers will hamper me too much from playing this way. 
---
Are my thoughts unfounded?
---

---
i expect it to fill quicker then back in the day due to current retail mentality. some people wont expect that they actually have to be nice.
---
It depends on what you want to do. If you like/don't mind healing, go priest because it gives you the option to be a shadow priest or a healer. Shadow priests in raids are few and far between because they take more gear to dish out damage against other classes. Also, they often are just better at healing.  
---
Shadow priests in PvP are boss though. I most likely will roll one this go around. Holy/disc is viable in PvP but as a support for someone like a warrior. If you want to rock face with a buddy, works well.
---
It’s relieving to know they check through feedback often.
---
Also, nice username, I remember blowing up my headphones with that song.
---
I didn’t include SM because usually horde apologists say Alliance is closer to BRM,  which is true. But then Horde is closer to AQ and then as you can see this leads nowhere. The FP situation tho is pretty hard to deny when it boils down to making leveling as horde much easier overall.
---
My question is...why did ever stop 😭💙
---
Since there's quite literally nothing anyone can do to another friendly player in Classic other than spam duel/invite them or stand on them.. not sure what the problem is here. Just ignore them. Blizzard already put the bumper guards on WoW from the get-go. If anything, they relaxed them for grouping post-vanilla (misdirection trolling, lifegrip, etc).
---
90% of the time I roll female characters, mostly due to the armor looking better on some pieces.
---
Anyone that asks "why are you playing a female as a dude, that's weird" 
---
Is probably over the age of 40 so don't worry :)
---
Alliance has to do the corpse walk of gator lunch through Wetlands, the corpse walk through killer orcs in the mountains of Lock Modan, and the relatively safe walk through Dun Morogh.  
---
Horde takes the zepplin of peace and serenity to UC.
---
So i guess ppl should just get good at pvp as a prot warrior... you're ridiculous. Or even better, try raiding as an arms warrior where literally no one will bring you with since you are useless.
---
The truth is, some classes just get shafted with the respecc costs while others are barely affected at all. And all the advocates for the costs are playing the classes which are barely affected.
---
And "just go create an alt" is ridiculous as well. Why should you be able to go pvping with your awesome raidgear which you got with your no-respec-class while others need to run around with their gimp green items because they can't raid in their pvp spec?
---
My first toon was an ally NE too, simply because I thought their cat form didn't look retarded. The flip jump and MJ dance were just bonuses.
---
3 Mages, 1 Warlock, 1 Priest
---
Unrelated, but on launch, how can I know which server will end up with a healthy population? I don't think there is even a way to tell which servers will be the populated ones. Any advice?

What level? Duskwood is good 29-32. Alterac is good for 36-39. Dustwallow for early 40s. If memory serves. All have low Armor, easy to single target kill and pull alone, they dont run away when low, constant steam of cloth for first aid, and coin per kill.
---
I personally dont like grinding, but sometimes you just need that level or two to get to a new zone or turn a red quest oj or yellow.
---
Good stuff.
---
Well- I had a friend in WoW who was a dude and only rolled female toons. He then joked about being a trap, then asked to be called she/her. Now? She's a year or so into HRT and dating another mutual WoW friend. :D  
---
\-but seriously it doesn't matter and it doesn't mean anything. I've had toons of both genders, just be aware that creepy dudes might hit on you something fierce if you roll a female dwarf.
---
Not sure if troll, but August 27th.
---
Insert generic obligatory Blizzard dick sucking comment here
---
Vanilla raiding, mage or warlock. I give a slight edge to mage because of the debuff limit. Hunters get the shaft often because of the debuff limit and need to dismiss pet or it just dies.
---
Horde
---
Didn't all the players who participated in the duel tournament go out of bounds to get to a closed-off area in Tirisfal Glades? So by your own admission, shouldn't Blizzard get involved and punish all those involved in the duel tournament?
---
When Frostmourne shattered, all the imprisoned souls were set free. Arthas’ soul was the first to be taken and the first to be returned, which is why I think he dies the way he does.
---
That’s my head canon at least.
---
Once you hit max in classic, you will have to repeatedly run Dire Maul, School, Stratholme, BRD, and maybe lower BRS
---
All previous dungeons lose thier relevance once you out level them.
---
I am also interested in generic spellbook icons that aren't rogue related.  
---
Does anyone have any suggested what I should add in addition to what I've got?
---
I am planning on adding one for professions.
---
I suggest priest or shaman. Paladin can be boring as heck to level. It depends on which faction you want to go though too. Priest is an option for both though.
---
I just want to be able to finish it. I remember spending hours wandering around it completely list with my guildmates. Then farming Dark Iron Ore there with my rogue. I know pretty much the entire layout now, but I’ve never taken down the Emperor. We got to the torch room once, but didn’t have the aoe to deal with the wandering packs.
---

I pulled that info from [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20100916030223/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25626575587&amp;postId=256239500325&amp;sid=1) "Ask the Dev" thread from many years ago.
---
A lot of the Undead Priest lore revolves around the Cult of Forgotten Shadows, which has a lot of quest chains in-game and is the official "religion" of the Forsaken.
---
Before the Forsaken ressurected the cult by finding the teachings of Natalie Selines in the ruins of Lordaeron (the other copies were locked away in Dalaran), they had a hard time reconciling themselves with necromancy, which is essentially slavery.
---
The central tenant of the cult is Divine Humanism, which states that your actions and emotions have the capacity to change the universe, that reality and life is part of The Shadow and it can only be understood and controlled by first understanding The Light. There is no inherent bond between yourself and the universe, you have to create that bond by imposing your will on the world around you. Hence the racial abilities name, *Will of the Forsaken*.
---
Another way to put this is that Forsaken believe the universe revolves around the self, whereas those that commune and worship nature believe the opposite.
---
Forsaken follow three virtues: Respect, Tenacity, and Power (with Power being the most important). Every creature is essentially the god of their universe. You must respect those with more power, have the tenacity to grow your power, and obtain the power necessary to impose your will on a larger part of the universe. Striving for more power is what separates the Forsaken from the Scourge. A Forsaken that doesn't thirst for power has no reason to exist.
---
One interesting note is that the Argent Dawn (and later the Argent Crusade) is represented by more Undead members than any other race. It's believed that these are all the Forsaken that didn't necessarily subscribe to The Cult of Forgotten Shadows.
---
If this kind of stuff interests you, I highly recommend downloading (or buying) the World of Warcraft Chronicles, especially Vol 2.
---
You're really underestimating some of the best levelers from private servers.
---
I appreciate the work Joana has put into his guides (I'm using them myself) and I don't doubt he's going to get 60 faster than the average player but from a gameplay and mechanical perspective there are a few people miles ahead who also have the resources to get world first. It will be a group effort, especially during the early levels.
---
they won't even make it to max level.  
---
if they don't quit by level 30 being a slog, they will quit when they can't afford a mount at 40. if they keep playing until 60 pvp guilds won't take them so they will be stranded in AV for the rest of their life and PvE guilds will ask them to get rid of their greens and non-enchanted gear.
---
I always suggest don't pick something that heals if you don't like healing. There will come times where you'll be nagged to heal.
---
Sweet pauldrons bro. They come in adult sizes or just youth?
---
Bro, if you are a well experienced warrior, you would ne good at fighting monsters and other players at the same time. Your RP arguement doesn't hold up imo.
---
Also as others have mentioned: some classes get shafted while others don't. And most advocates for the costs are the people who play classes which can both raid and pvp with rhe same spec.
---
nice snuck premise
---
sorry if you actually have a 1 in a million unicorn guild but in my quest for digesting wow content ive watched many a what kind of guild to look out for video and the number top 2 suggestions were
---
1.  avoid inviting members that are package deals
---
1. a group of friends always has favoritism
---
1. there better be a good reason for loot council
---
i think community will indeed be better, anyone whos after a challenge will play retail
---
&gt; The reality of PvP servers is that no one actually attacks someone else unless they're 99% sure they're going to win because they out-level, out-gear, or out-number the other party. Every other case they don't engage or just run away if they think they'll lose.
---
This has not at all been the case on the Beta.
---
Jokes on you, dont even never pauldrons when I ERP in Goldshire
---
I remember watching some streamer doing DM, tank ninja pulled and died, leaving afterwards, it's not really about the game, but about people. Sadly we would face many toxic players on our journey, even if it's classic
---
I kinda like having an extra chill activity to do at max level and professions will be it. Debating if I wait and farm for epic mount before I commit. The cost and time of blacksmithing is kinda a turn off so I'll probs be going engineering on my warrior and bombs should be useful for aoe tanking.
---
Does anyone know if engineering bombs generate threat?
---
Oh, so once guilds have progressed completely through Mythic, they can still push to progress to the next highest level?  That's cool.  Good thing about the flexibility in lower levels.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
nice, are there any shields at play?
---
SM is a major instance that's on horde territory though. Alliance has Gnomer on their territory but horde get a fucking teleport straight to the entrance from Booty Bay.
---
Pretty sure Wolfshead helm is BiS for the whole of TBC. There's probably a couple other items that wouldn't be replaced by Karazhan/Gruul loot as well.
---
This is the real answer.
---
Not in BB, but at the camp. You get a quest started in Org that is pretty simple and rewarss you with an item that allows you to use a teleporter at the camp.
---
there are... well actually probably less than a dozen of us.
---
I always refused to kick anyone. Felt it was a crutch. Unless someone was obviously, intentionally bad.
---
Van shaman is probably the closest thing to a true support that WoW has seen, even Enhance spends a lot of their time dropping/swapping totems to buff the party. They have a lot more decision making than a lot of other classes unless you plan on heavy PvP, where I hope you like the Frost Shock visual.
---
Dude he means his quiver lol
---
&gt; You are probably a newer player that doesn't remember the old days of factions actually being different and hating each other.
---
Nope, I played on launch and quit around Cata with a few Retail stints here and there before switching to Pservers. The majority of my comments are explaining why Humans are the Nazis of Azeroth.
---
I'm not sure if the rank matters. The function that Blizzard uses for combat events gives a spell name as it would be in the spell book. There is a separate field for spell id and each spell rank has a unique id.
---
Hey there. We are [Hero Association], its a guild formed by a bunch of real life friends (of which i am not one, haha, but i am one of the officers) - its a friendly guild that doesnt go hardcore, but still plans to consistently clear content. One of my personal regrets in original vanilla was not seeing enough content - even though i later caught up and went to be pretty well progressed with multiple server firsts - so i will most definitely be trying to push towards strong progression - although we will still focus on a laid back atmosphere. 
---
The raid times are 20:30-23:30 UK time (so 21:30-00:30 server time), although days are unconfirmed yet (at least 3 days though). We will be on EU PVE servers. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions - and i could give you a discord invite!
---
We are currently closed on Main Tank spot, but we do have some offtank spots if you wanted - or plenty of DPS spots if you chose to either go fury warrior or mage. We definetely have a spot for your friend as well!
---
Leveling to 60 will weed out the BfA weebs
---
I raided through AQ40 but best times was lower geared friend showing me ways to BRD and ST. I simply never had time or interest to "finish" those. Like beeing there was better than any of the raids i was ever in.
---
This post needs more attention
---
I’m that way too. Love Tauren, but overall like Alliance more. 
---
Go with Alliance as your main. You can always make a Tauren alt to experience some of the Tauren and Horde story and zones.
---
[Caen from the guild Bloodsworn](https://youtu.be/VChff4AWFpE) who was a Thunderfury wielding undead rogue on Shadowmoon has an amazing video and GOAT intro.
---
What if theres an item so rare its yet to be seen
---
Thanks a lot! Don't forget to upvote if you enjoy it :) I plan to do more if people like it
---
i will be doing 4 planned dungeons on my route to 60, and many group quests. The second anyone ninja loots me, they will be on this list. If anyone is a dick in general, they will be on this list. I dont even have to speak to any of these people before i know i want them on this list
---
Yawn
---
What's more interesting:  
---
world quest tagging war?
---
AoE farming SM graveyard?  
---
How about if a Shaman was tanking?
---
sure, if it's for EU too
---
Yeah, I'm not denying that the Horde has a clear advantage here.
---
To people saying the game has been “figured out,” I'm loving these non-traditional comp experiments actually taking place.

Our main tank slot is currently closed, but we have some offtank spots, and plenty of dps/healer spots as well.
---
all of these work the same from Gutterspeak to Common btw
---
I guess that just goes to show what kind of absolutely entitled whiner you are. Blizzard will give you beta access then wipe and powder your tushy for you because of a jumpy boi standing in your way. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww your fee fees, do you want some bits and twitch prime to make it all better? Awwwwwwwwwww
---
Thank you for the reply, how did you find farming at end game? Or did you group up?
---
I mean, do you honestly think the 400+* dev team at WoW are legitimately full of incompetent retards that love the current model of retail exactly as it is? They design their game the way they do because it appeals to a mass casual fanbase and that is what their research shows everyone wants and their leadership demands. Hopefully the launch of Classic and (fingers crossed) future success of it will show Blizzard that people want a little more struggle in their journey and they will change their design philosophy going forward for retail as well.
---
Obviously, we will never get the "perfect" magic and love we got with Vanilla again with any actual "new" content. The people that cared are gone, and a game like that can't be made today by a big AAA company with massive 400 man teams. Too much polish, research and refusal to take risks kills creativity and passion. But if they specifically set out to research and follow the exact things that made Vanilla so fun, they can definitely make something DECENT. 
---
In regards to TBC specifically, I don't want a complete overhaul or new game. I was hoping class mechanics would be more in-line with Vanilla than TBC, with abilities being rebalanced to be good rather than just completely changing some rotations or trees outright as well as possibly the removal of flying and some redesign to accommodate that. TBC was great as it was, but even in Classic, Blizzard was slow to fix things back then and never did fix some things. Actually balancing things properly and in a timely manner, even though they have a bad track record of that, would be ideal and what I hope for.
---
*I can't find a listing of the exact size of the dev team. I know at one point a few years back it was stated to be 250, and I heard somewhere they added an extra team and it was 400ish. No idea the size, but it's massive either way and the exact number isn't relevant to my point as long as it's in the hundreds.
---
Look. We lost the second war, but if it weren’t for the gnomes who sold victory out to the allies from under our feet, we’d be standing in Paris—Orgrimmar right now. 
---
My fellow dwarves I know the last decade has been tough, with a simple Kharnos blood sausage costs more than the Dwarfmarcks the average Aerie Peak blacksmith makes in a month.
---
Follow me, bronzebeard, and I will retake the dwarves lands for dwarves and cast the malignant traitorous gnomes from our lands once and for all.
---
Long live Khaz Modan.
---
Tbf you put the ~ which means you approximated!
---
I saw it in another thread in this sub with some maths behind it. I dont think it matters much unless people are looking to speed level. I prefer to level shadow cause its cooler looking and more fun, plus adds to potential pvp encounters.
---
Also yes I am being flippant. Obviously there are a bunch of good talents. I just meant to say that the wand and spirt talents are the most important by far.
---
Do you really think the 20% range is worth it? I was gonna skip it. Would you take it just for leveling or end game shadow too?
---
Right, it teaches you to start remembering names of the good and bad players.  So you know who to add to your friends list and who to completely avoid next time.
---
Says the hunter who never has to respec since it works in both pvp and pve
---
IK, some people used to complain about travelling in WoW, not realizing that the scale of the World was what made classic feel like it had depth.
---
I'd be curious to hear a comparison of difficulties between Mythic+ and the Ulduar hardmodes (when they were current, of course).
---
I can't imagine fights being much harder than firefighter or one-light-in-the-darkness. They were ridiculous.
---
id say being able to steam roll content means the game is figured out
---
just because something isnt meta doesnt mean anything outside that is new and upcoming
---
Meeting stones were added sometime late in vanilla IIRC, but all they were was a group finder. I know that at least with 2.4.4 (TBC) the meeting stones could summon as long as two party members were present.
---
Other than what's already mentioned, I'd say levels 1-30 before the factions start questing in the same contested zones, Alliance has the more interesting and varied zones. With Horde you're pretty much either in Depressing Undead Land or Scorching Desert.
