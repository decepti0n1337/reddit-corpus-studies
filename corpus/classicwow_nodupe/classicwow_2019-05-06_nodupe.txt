I intend to roll Alliance so that's good news.
---

---
I'm guessing it's because of Salvation, right? Do the warlocks usually get salvation priority or how did that work?
---
---
---
Touché
---
So optimal comps are irrelevant because any comp can clear any content. Got it.
---
Dude I’m having so much trouble putting time into a game!! Give us the slow slow burn of classic already
---
1. Misrepresenting someone's position is legitimately bad behavior. You shouldn't do it, and moreover you should stop doing it when it is pointed out that you are doing it. 
---
2. The point about about communism is not a deflection, it's an example that I am using to make my point. It's how you should argue. 
---
3. I am not sure exactly what you want changed, but I can't think of anything that I think would make the game better without potentially having massive drawbacks. For example, maybe you want to buff boomkins and feral tanks to make them viable - now druids are far better than other classes because they can do everything (a problem that literally started happening in TBC because of that exact change). So what you consider problems I consider to be good game design. THe changes you want and think will improve things I think will make the game worse. And that's the point behind #nochanges.
---
3. You can bow out, that's fine.
---
I see the appeal of PVP servers it's just not for me. I don't like being on edge when I'm running through the world doing my thing. I never really had any good PVP server experience unfortunately.
---
I still find the popularity of PVP surprising. I started a PVE server guild and I get a few msgs saying "the guild looks good but why PVE?" When I started playing wow PVE servers were far more popular.
---
Still looking forward to smashing some face in Battlegrounds though!
---
[removed]
---
I thought about hitting a pserver but I really wanna save my hours for classic. Worth it?? WoW did a great job of progression and the smallest improvements feel big. That was the secret sauce.
---
I'll be playing Hunter so no need to choose just one 😉
---
I remeber we did 4 horsemen then we went to some eletric boss where if you stand in the right spot you would wipe the group and i wiped is 2 times but they were still really cool to me.
---
Wands don't use any kind of attack power calculation at all. The damage is what's on the wand, the speed is what's on the wand. I think as long as your wand skill is same as enemies defense they have a flat 5% resist chance and a 5% crit chance. The damage is 'elemental' which means it gets affected by mob elemental resist or vulnerability.
---
Good words
---
No bro
---
We all needa reinforce the environment of a learning mentality.
---
I was cheeky. Hopefully we cross on a field of underpowered moonfires(fuck is that even what you call that blue laserbeam of death)
---
Yoo post that Andorhol one
---
Never at any point did I say that any comp can clear any content.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh right, your reading comprehension is 0. Got it
---
That's all assuming that you can easily clear Naxx though, which few guilds will actually do.
---
It’s a little bold of me to assume I’ll make it to 60. 
---
Jk - since I’ll probably be maining a rogue, I would most likely choose mage as my alt, given I got one to 30 in vanilla I feel I owe it to the long forgotten mage of my past
---
It’s a little bold of me to assume I’ll make it to 60.
---
You know, I hate to do this on Reddit, but I admit given this perspective I’m wrong. I rescind.
---
Well said
---
I forgot how long it took to get out of combat in retail servers. Or maybe that was an early patch thing.
---
It’s not as common as you’d think.

Threat aside, once you put up your curse, it's just a matter of whether or not you want to press Shadowbolt or Frostbolt for the next few minutes. Threat's an important thing to be thinking about, but if you're worried about feeling bored with your class in raids, that's something to look into as well and identify what makes a class fun and engaging for you. Neither one's a bad call, and like another commenter said, Warlock threat is harder to deal with as horde than alliance due to Blessing of Sanctuary.
---
You've got options though. Other tools are available to handle threat later on like [these](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21647) [trinkets.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=23001)
---
When classic wow comes out whats the benefit from killing enemies in a pvp server ? Wiki says there are rewards as u climb ranks but what is a "higher quality bracers" etc.  Is it all just purely cosmetics and gear ? And is this a viable path to gear up on launch ?
---
8 hours for growing bodies / maximum growth more for teenagers and people who go gym.
---
4 hours a night is all you need for full functionality 😉
---
De komolyan, baromi jok.
---
ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
---
In a raid it’s common to have 4+ paladins, which means you have all the blessings.  Everyone ~~should~~ be using a threat meter as well.
---
If you're alliance, it's no big deal because of blessing of salvation. 
---
Prior to 1.12, it was a pretty big issue on horse side just because the only way to reduce threat was via either death or grace of air totem, and it was rare that you would actually get a grace of air totem. 
---
Once 1.12 came out (or maybe 1.11) warlocks demonology tree was reworked and they added master demonologist.  It was a pretty big boon, because it gave warlocks 20% threat reduction with an Imp out.  And Imps were already sort of the preferred pet for raiding for the stamina boost.  
---
The MD/Ruin did slightly less (10%) damage than the old SM/Ruin spec, but it was much more raid friendly.  And, in the event that your group didn't need stam, and you weren't close to capping your threat, you could use demonic sacrifice on your Succubus for 15% shadow damage buff.  
---
The playstyle in Raids is basically the same as Mage.  That is, you mostly just spam your spell.  For warlocks it's Shadow Bolt.  For Mages it's Frostbolt in MC/BWL, and Fireball elsewhere.
---
Make it a Grind but not one that can ONLY be done by acc sharing and wasting your health.
---
#nochanges in this case will lead to severe health issues for some. Blizz should Not promote such behaviour.
---
Either it should be changed to something crazy like this: 
---
R1    50    total HK
---
R2    100  total HK
---
R3    250  ...
---
R4    500  .. 
---
R5    1k    
---
R6    2.5k 
---
R7    5k    
---
R8    10k 
---
R9    25k 
---
R10  50k 
---
R11  100k
---
R12  250k
---
R13  500k
---
R14  1million  total HK
---
(dont take those numbers serious. It is an example)
---
Or at least Take the 20% loss out so people can take breaks every other week and just keep their progress like in every other barfilling grind in the game. Imaging losing 20% rep every week by default
---
Keep it insane to reach r14! But dont pressure people to cast away their wellbeing.
---
We should know better and not #nochanges this one issue.
---
 
---
Blizzard should know better.
---
It did work out for me with Tailoring with a strong focus on grinding instead of questing as a warlock.  
---
Especially if you're like me and can't stand looking like a clown.  
---
You actually need a certain robe to craft the "Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe", and the recipe only drops of some elite Defias mob in Duskwood.
---
Theyre easy to solo and just the normal robe from the recipe looks pretty badass. You can make some cash with it as long as you're the only one with the recipe because a lot of the more casual warlocks will be looking for that robe aswell, and getting the recipe is a pain in the ass if you're not constantly looking for that elite mob (like 5 minute respawn and there are only around \~3 of those in Duskwood.
---
Anyway, if you want to rush to 60 I wouldn't do any professions. But if you plan to take it more casual and do your classquests, and are a warlock then I say go for it.   
---
The Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe looks so frickin good and you get to keep until your 50s\~, so you will avoid looking like a clown for a very long time.
---
r/buildapc is very helpful.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you need monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse?
---
On launch we'll be playing on content phase 1, which has no PVP tracking or rewards. It isn't until phase 2 a few months down the line when the honor system becomes active and you can get raid-quality gear  from PVPing and achieving rank 10.
---
Thats a good thing, it will keep me home and not spending money
---
No bfa sucks tagged everywhere ?
---
With Salvation it's not a worry. And both warlock and mage have the most boring playstyle in the game.
---
I mean, it's not like I gave that information in the original post so it's all good. If I was literally starving and paying money for wow, your point would still stand
---
It sounds like warlock pve has the same issues I had with mage back in vanilla, namely using only 1-2 spells. 
---
I will take that advice to heart and look at some other classes and their rotations in raids. 
---
It's a shame because I really enjoyed playing warlock in pvp, I still might roll one just for the pvp though.
---
&gt;so i am not trying to spend like a grand or anything crazy
---
Good because you can run Classic on a Jersey Royal potato.
---
But honestly if you're *just* looking to play Classic then any fairly modern rig will do. I would advise 4GB RAM as a minumum. Considering it used to run 60 FPS on my 2GB RAM, onboard GPU Dell piece of shit 15 years ago though, I think you're going to be fine with just about anything.
---
Never heard of anyone actually using MD/Ruin though.
---
Actually it's not paid. You save it up from the year before (through taxes or a "fee" your employer takes out of your salary). That is what everyone gets by law, some employers do pay more but I would look at that like more of a bonus. 
---
I'm sure you know this just trying to scare away the Americans by mentioning taxes.
---
I'd say the leveling is harder, but everything else is quite casual.
---
yeah its like 60s and he spawns once every couple hours iirc.  Not sure how much it'll sell for in Vanilla, if I had to guess I'd say 20-30g (pure speculation). I only started paying attention once the whole pet system was revamped.
---
This is awesome! I love when people do stuff like this.
---
Its attempt number 3 to downplay Classic release by angsty Retail players. They tried the legal argument against Nostalrius, then tried the nostalgia argument and now its this.
---
No MMO requires any sort of significant ability to play compared to 2D fighting games, RTS and certain FPS titles. A BFA babby to tell a Vanilla babby that one is more skilled than the other is ridiculous.
---
They hate the idea that the WoW playerbase will be split now between Classic and Retail, which is at the core of their constant attempts to downplay it. What they deem "skill" is rehearsing scripted content and downloading proper WeakAuras.
---
I rush to 60 on pservers, but for Classic I'll be leveling Engineering as I go. Catch me in STV starting 15 v 15 pride fights at Nessingwary's camp throwing all kinds of grenades.
---
Raiding is quite casual? Getting rank 14 is quite casual?
---
Yeah that's what it sounds like, which is a shame since I really like the theme of warlocks. What classes/specs have a fun playstyle in your opinion?
---
Don't play a holy warrior.
---
Most of the benefit from World PvP is just the fun of the experience. Rewards will come out with the honor system, which won't be immediately available at launch. Ranks 1-14 give different rewards over time if you're actively gaining honor by killing people of the opposite faction, and it becomes progressively harder to raise your rank the higher you go. [Here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Honor_system_\(pre-2.0\)#Ranks_and_rewards) are the ranks what kind of equipment you get at each rank. The only cosmetic rewards are tabards at ranks 1 and 6. You can get a blue and an epic set of gear for your class between ranks 7 and 10 and 12 and 13, you can also get mounts, potions, a battle standard buff, and some miscellaneous pieces. Here are [some](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16486) [examples](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18429) of the blue bracers that you can get at rank 5.
---
Yup, i need everything.  My budget is most likely going to be about 400- 600. I can post on that sub too but I dont know the exact specs of classic so I would feel foolish asking them with no real base guidelines aside from an unreleased game. You guys get it though lol
---
Thanks for some of the tips!
---
I've rarely been able to get through most fan music. I got through this. Legit music and production. Funny too.
---
So true. And that music..
---
Goblin so you can craft your own sappers and rocket boots. Their rocket boots are faster than the Gnomish version but they break a lot.
---
I'm going to signup for tinder just so I can turn down a bunch of women out of my league.
---
&gt; Human and Orc paired with a melee class.
---
What about as a tank horde side? Orc looses some of it appeal in a tanking role. Troll would have highest TPS at high gear levels.
---
The raiding is very casual yes. Ranking up is a big time sink but doesn't require much skill.
---
All of Jame's dungeon guides are fantastic and work with his leveling guides.
---
Then why did so few people back in the day ever see Kel’Thuzad?
---
I like Goblin because you can be self reliant and craft your own sappers and Goblin rocket boots (which are faster than the Gnomish rocket boots)
---
Hunter, Warrior, Rogue, any healer/tank.
---
Oh, I wasn't aware of that. I have only heard about DM/ruin and SM/ruin when I did some research on the class, but MD/ruin sounds like a nice alternative if I feel like the threat is an issue. 
---
But after reading the comments and realizing warlock is another 1 button class (like mage) I might end up rolling a different class entirely.
---
I mean if you’re going to pay taxes it might as well go into benefits like PTO, rather than whichever war in the Middle East the US gov is starting this week
---
Because they were atrociously bad and had unplayable MS &amp; FPS.
---
Because people were terrible in vanilla
---
&gt; I find it hard to believe that there is such a clear cut divide
---
It isn't. Battle chicken buffs your whole party so even if you have just 1 melee in your group it's worth using. 
---
I like Goblin because you can be self reliant and craft your own sappers and Goblin rocket boots (which are faster than the Gnomish rocket boots but break more.) Sappers have a 60 second craft time for a single one, so it's nice not having to bug a guildmate for them.
---
Very nice
---
I think they meant more casual as there aren’t as many weekly lockouts to min max your progression. You don’t need to get your weekly +15, weekly world boss, weekly warfront, weekly pvp, weekly heart of Azeroth and weekly raids. Sure the raids world bosses are still on a lockout but that is basically it,
---
In classic you are able to progress through content at your own pace. You are able take a weeks break, return the following week and try to catch up on the previous week (if you so desired). Rather than missing a week in retail and feeling like you are now behind everyone else because you missed a weeks worth of weeklys. 
---
PS sorry if some of my BFA info is outdated I only lasted a month before leaving that monstrosity, but have played every expansion and the ‘weekly’ principle has pretty much applied since WoD
---
Yeah I’m sorry I don’t buy into this argument. The average player age back then was 28, not everyone was dumb kids.
---
So, you're really just stacking up some rested xp.
---
You'll buy it once Classic releases and every single raid gets cleared within hours of release. Recently Naxx was released on a private server and KT died within 3 hours.
---
Old me: newb enhancement shaman 
---
New me: going to try legit shaman tanking in 5 mans while leveling up and also try elemental after 40
---
Engineering is nice for Battle Chicken which occasional buffs your entire group and pet with melee attack speed for 5 minutes. Goblin Sappers are also highly valuable in high tier PVE fights like Vicidius.
---
Im sorry to anybody that doesn’t
---
It's not really nostalgia, it's just a real MMO.
---
As amusing and presumptuous as this post is, the doom and gloom of it all is pretty exaggerated.  You seem like you have an obligation to say that what, a companies primary goal is to make profit?    And to assume lawsuits are the only action to take?  There is a reason they keep doing loot boxes etc and that is because the consumer is willing to pay for their product.  If people didnt sink money into it, they wouldn't exist.
---
Living Action Potion which comes out in ZG patch. Can be drunk during a stun to break it.
---
ones a healing item and ones a DPS item???? what u talking bout...
---
Complaining about someone putting in effort and making a video... That’s a big yikes from me.
---
I (and most people I talk to) just use it to get a feel for what char we want to play when classic comes out. Like I never rolled on a druid, so I'm trying one out to see if it's worth going for when classic drops.
---
It's hard to say for sure if this counts as content or a system....
---
If it's considered content, we won't get them get till Phase 5. 
---
Though on the other hand...since they did technically exist during the early beta but were removed and re-added in 1.9, they could say they're simply using their beta version with it's 1.12 mechanics and not bothering with removing them since the "problem" (they aren't linked) doesn't exist in 1.12 mechanics).
---
If it's considered a system we'll have them on release.
---
God I hope not, all we need is some fucking jerkoff trying to make the next raider io for Classic by trolling through armory stats.
---
spell power paladins inst a real thing you've been watching too many meme vids.
---
lol this is great! im so glad i started in BC when all this modern shit wasnt in the game and you had to actually play the game
---
I hope a lot of younger players such as yourself get into the game. It will allow a whole new generation of gamers to experience a masterpiece.
---
You should check out Platinum Wow on YouTube.  He has a dungeon dive series which is enjoyable to watch in my opinion! The videos go over quests, boss loot and etc
---
11 bucks a month for OSRS is where its been at for me past few months.  cant wait to cancel that jump to classic wow
---
Yes, you can craft the belt and make profit for sure.
---
&gt; Which spells can I skip ranks of?
---
Priest doesn't have as many skippable spells as some classes, but probably stuff like Resurrection rank 2 and 3 and  Prayer of Healing rank 1.
---
I know for sure. here come the 6-8hr play seshs
---
I am hoping the same. But it isn't something I have seen come up
---
We do actually! Blizzard said that they won't downgrade items, but that items which were added in later patches will be added in at different points of the content schedule.
---
Since Ban'thok sash was in the game at 1.1 but was updated in 1.10, it'll have its final stats in 1.13. But things like the UBRS turban won't be added until late in the content cycle.
---
Anyone still using the term "cuck" unironically is just pure cringe. It's like bringing out your anime body pillow girlfriend.
---
It happened during vanilla as well. My server unfortunately had a few 59's hiding from the 60's ranking up and fucking it up for everyone but they accidently leveled and got destroyed at R13 so fuck em.
---
I remember mages using cold snap was frowned upon
---
it won't be with 1.12 itemization
---
Yeah this sub exploded, its now almost 40,000 subs more than the private server subreddit. I mean damn, we blew past it and will be doubling it soon. I know alot of us came from that  subreddit to this one, but wow...
---
Yeah well that's healing gear. Not really relevant to a DPS item.
---
Remember that the Classic client is not the original 1.12 client. I'd say a minimum for RAM these days is closer to 8GB on a gaming machine.
---
you are confusing casual players with casual games and they're not the same thing. casual players have been playing wow since its release. and yes, wow at time of release was considered a casual mmo. in 2019 it's not, in modern context it's much more hardcore than retail. in terms of a game, the difference between casual and hardcore is in the effort in:reward out design.
---
a very simple and easy example would be lootbox type mechanics in games. the very existence of lootboxes is a casual mechanic because it provides very high level rewards for an extremely minimal (casual) effort - often just for logging into the game.
---
if somebody is saying vanilla is more casual and retail is more hardcore than they don't understand this difference or they're speaking specifically about raiding, which is about the only part of the game today that could be said to have hardcore aspects to it.
---
Some fuckwad will do that anyways somehow.
---
It was specifically for the threat reduction and mostly on horde since Alliance had bosalve.
---
Private servers have [armories](https://legacyplayers.com/Search/Default.aspx) and no one ever made any raider io type addons/sites.
---
While I don't agree with people hate towards raider io, it simply wound not work in vanilla.
---
the easy solution is to press vanish.
---
Venezuela this time
---
That's not true, the recommended sleep range for adults and seniors is between 7 to 9 hours of sleep. 4 hours is absolutely not enough (unless you're part of an extremely extremely rare group that has a very specific genetic mutation, you're almost surely not)
---
4 hours is barely enough for 2 sleep cycles, we need more than that per sleep, usually around 4 to 6 for an healthy adult
---
I do. I'm willing to bet a million bucks that Blizzard fixes that spot.
---
Everyone but the tanks get Salvation, it's 15min buff. You also get bonus stats from Kings which I believe is better than the horde bonuses for warlocks but I'm not 100%.
---
On a gaming machine, yeah 8GB is minimum, but even with the client changes I'd be surprised if most non-gaming comps wouldn't be capable of running Classic what with all those low poly models, poor textures and shitty spell effects. I can only imagine it might get a bit spicy in battlegrounds.
---
..you even had a GF through out this? Teach us
---
I mean it's obviously Corrupted Ashbringer
---
Foreign interference...
---
And fake populism
---
but what you're forgetting about the effort in:reward out model is that how a player experiences it varies depending on how much of \*that kind of game\* they've played in the past.
---
for example, a player new to WoW who gets to choosse between BFA and classic, and chooses classic, will have a  (to use a dumbly quoted private server word) 'fresher brain' to experience that effort - reward model. whereas a person who has played from classic to BFA for 15 years, over years and expansions, their brains have learned/been trained/been altered in the inevitable way that says 'to keep players interested we must give them more rewards, more often, and with  more ways to get those rewards' with each successive expansion.
---
i guess this is where you and I differ, 'cuz I say that the player who puts 40 hours into classic is exactly as 'hardcore' as the player who puts 40 hours into BFA.
---
the lootbox is just an aspect of the game, and the player gets to decide if they invest 'time' in the game, or 'money' in order to save 'time' and get the loot from the lootbox
---
the difference between hardcore and casual is time invested. because player A could invest 40 hours a week for a year and kill zero raid bosses, while player B invests 20 hours a week and kills a hundred raid bosses.
---
to me, they're both hardcore
---
Not enough to matter. Trolls are slightly favored as Tanks though, since berserking's attack speed means they can generate threat slightly faster at the start of the fight.
---

Benediction

The 5 second rule is an important concept.  Spirit-based mana regeneration only starts 5 seconds after your last cast that costs mana.  So finishing off low hp mobs with a wand is a super useful way to start your regen early.  Using a spell to finish will waste several ticks of regen.
---
    i guess this is where you and I differ, 'cuz I say that the player who puts 40 hours into classic is exactly as 'hardcore' as the player who puts 40 hours into BFA.
---
yeah i agree with that. i don't think you understood my post.
---
I’m hoping to create a Melee specialised Tauren survival Hunter. is such a thing possible or practical? I wouldn’t cast off ranged all together, too many important ranged spells, but I certainly want it to be dangerous to get too close to me. Would I be wasting valuable skill points? 
---
Bonus question, could hunters dual wield swords in vanilla?
---
Truth.
---
It's going to be using the same engine as retail wow, so whatever they recommend to run it on high for cheapest is a good bet.
---
Speaking from the standpoint of someone who spent entirely too much time twinking in the 30-39 bracket, I basically never saw paladins.
---
If you want the best chance I'd try and get a very slow two-hander and go [this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sZZVbhtrc). You're still going to be at a huge disadvantage however. Anyone you get a leg up on will just run and you'll never be able to do anything about it. So any fight you initiate they just run, and any fight you don't want to get initiated on means that you can't run. Whole lot of lose/lose going on there.
---
Prot can be usefull in PvP if you're fighting a rogue or a fury warrior. Other than that it's completely useless. Also this does nothing to fix the previous problem.
---
This is so cringe
---
The playerbase decline was due to an intense content drought. Many players actually think MoP was one of the best contemporary (ie post WOTLK) expansions because of the class design decisions, primarily
---
Because Naxx was released when a lot of people decided that trying to raid it would be useless when their gear would be obsolete in a few months when BC came out. Back then we thought BC was coming out in late November but Blizz pushed the release back.
---
I'm not saying Naxx didn't require effort, but it's a bad example given the timeline.
---
lmao
---
Only play pvp if you like both to gank and be ganked. I guess if you have a group of friends who agree to always play together you can shift the balance to gank most of the time. I'll be playing on pve, i tried pvp both in vanilla and on pserver and it's as crap as i remembered. I never felt an urge to kill the opposing faction so pvp has no attraction for me. I enjoy being able to afk at flightpoints and grind my quests in peace.
---
Armor &gt; Axe &gt; Mace = Sword for gold making imo
---
How painful is it to level a paladin?  What's the ret rotation?  Is there a spec that I can use to level as ret and heal in dungeons?
---
I'm in the same boat man, trying to hit Plat and drop it as soon as Classic comes out
---
i havent found any game that gives me gaming passion back since i left wow. Gamed nonstop from 5yo to 31yo... Classic will bring this back.
---

Hey, thanks for the help! Already thought that paladins are at a big disadvantage, as I have, like, no dmg except autos. lol
---
Sucks tho, but oh well, late levels will be better, i hope.
---
The entire game isn't casual, but most of it is. If you're a casual player who doesn't play a lot you're never going to be cutting edge, but you will eventually make it through 90% of the content vanilla WoW has to offer. You might be a raid tier behind the hardcore players; you might still be working on MC when BWL comes out, but you will make it through eventually.
---
Have you been introduced to our lord and saviour spirit warrior?
---
Isn't Axes pretty much the only reason to go with weaponsmithing?  
---
You get Nightfall eventually which is one of the few reasons to actually specialize in weapons I think.
---
You can't bot r14.
---
Hell you can't even bot r13 or r12, believe the cutoff for pugging would be r11 and it would be slow as fuck. Blizzard has been much better at banning bots in retail for some years now as well.
---
Awesome explanation, thanks a lot.
---
Except it's worse than MCP. You're not gonna funnel the mats to make a legendary staff for a feral druid "because it gives attack power in animal forms" when it's a DPS loss compared to a lvl 29 blue item. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The only time you won't spam those MCP charges if for solo farming or trash mobs, where your DPS does not justify a legendary weapon quite frankly.

I started on a pserver just to plan out my path for launch. I'm still not burned out and it helps with my excitement for official launch. Playing on a dead server has taught me that even a few months after launch, when all the tourist has left, the game is still fun and playable.
---
T2 with Sulfuras would look so sick
---
Duuuuude, that's good work.
---
by my definition of casual, vanilla hits the mark much more than current. why? 1) there's no daily checklist of things i feel obligated to do. the only obligations i have in this game are the ones i make with other players. i can log on whenever i want and not feel like i am missing something. 2) as somebody who enjoys leveling, pvp and dungeons, i can log on and immediately have fun. imo dungeons and pvp in the current game aren't that fun until max level, which means slogging through a boring, neutered leveling experience. not so as the leveling is fun at level 1, the dungeons are fun at level 14, and the pvp is fun at level 19. no long, unfun chunks of content i have to force myself to do before i can get to the good stuff.
---
As someone who played to 60 on both server types back in Vanilla, I'm of the opinion of that while yes, PvP is harder and even frustrating at times, it gives leveling a sense of excitement that isn't there on PvE. 
---
PvP best. Keep the WAR in Warcraft.
---
It all depends on if we get a open beta or addon creators get access. If not count on 1 or 2 days until addons become available
---
Vanilla was very casual but also had room for hardcore.
---
Vanilla, you could play little, spend almost your entire time leveling, then reach 60 after months and do some dungeons, and join a raiding guild while still sucking and managing to down bosses because the content was easy (Remember, afk hunters meme was a thing back then). At least that's what most of my friends who played classic told me, they didn't get far into naxx though, but a lot of their members were dogshit and they still downed nefarian and like 3 bosses in naxx.
---
Appreciate ya!
---
Wait...drop? You know Drtosh?
---
No one cheats, that would be wrong.  :D
---
My money and time, will spend it as I please.  If you get your rocks off thinking you're a better person for acting righteous and not being able to compete with me that's cool.
---
You can heal dungeons as a ret pally while you're leveling no problem. Your experience leveling as ret will be pretty safe, but very slow and tedious. Ret doesn't have access to many active abilities. The closest thing ret pallies have to a rotation is Seal+Judgement+Recast Seal+Melee for 8-10 seconds+Judgement - repeat. Eventually you'll have access to consecration on an 8-10ish second cooldown, but even lower ranks will cost so much mana that you'll have trouble sustaining it. You pretty much just passively whack things until they die. It's not hard. It's just boring, and ret has very limited options at 60 outside of PvP. Holy Paladins are always in demand though.
---
Oh shit I didn't even notice the skull and all that lmao.  
---
Weird to put Corrupted Ashbringer up there instead of Might of Menethil though.
---
I just want a RPPvP server. Since there won't be one, I'll just pick a PvP server since RPPvE servers are full of perverts.
---
Actually that was me. I downvoted both of you. You because your idea of what makes something casual is super narrow, and his first post because of the needless comment about youtubers. I upvoted his second post though, because it was solid, and with no pointless whinging.
---
Your self-righteous snark after you convinced yourself that he downvoted you is pretty lame.
---
I'm in exactly the same spot haha finally built up a nice base fitness and have a new bike but hey hey time for wow lol
---
Ok. I just remembered it was LFG was only in the major cities, which was part of the reason people was hanging out there, but i might remember wrong then
---
Thank you very much for doing that test! Sounds like it’s pretty good, but might be better than arms before 40.  Can you let me know how you tested this stuff? I might be interested to play around with this.
---
I love that you included the 1h/shield stuff. I guess one fun thing that could be tested is a arms/fury hybrid with improved overpower and dual wield. 
---
I’m thinking going for overpower early allows for a good dual wield build early that might be better than 2h. Might be worth respeccing to fury once you can get enrage, depending on if you can trigger it reliably.
---
I don't even have to click that link to know it's Robe of Power
---
Thanks.  I'd like to heal in PvE and PvP as Ret.  Is ret pretty good in PvP?  Is there a spec that will allow me to do both?
---
I live nearby as well. You can't simply knock on the gate and they'll let your tour the place and let you meet everyone.
---
You have to sign up for a tour that they do once a month, which is also booked months in advance because spots are limited.
---
Even then you can't meet the devs. In order to do that, you have to go to a midnight release and wait for hours in line for them to sign something for you, where you have 3 seconds to thank them and move on to the next dev.
---
It's not as great as it may seem.
---
If we are really lucky time for releases will differ between patches if for example patch 2 is more then 2 months long I'll have a problem. Mainly because ganking will be a huge problem in this phase. If I got to pick my preferences p 1 is 3-4 months p2 is 2 months p3 3-4 months p4 2 months p5 4-5 months. This will give ppl time to clear current content and gear for next phase. But that's just my preferences
---
Classic doesn't really satisfy the same itch that Melee does, and vice versa. So I will probably play both about 50/50.
---
Do you understand any of the context here? The people OP referred to are big classic fans, and one of them does almost exclusively classic content. They aren't attempting to sabotage classic, and they aren't angsty retail players.
---
Do you even read posts or do you just immediately jump to conclusions?
---
I never understood why they made the legendary staff look like a lvl5 white staff
---
This is a really good question.. it didn’t exist until TBC.
---
Well gold is a bit more useful in vanilla since epic mounts are expensive and uncommon at first which gives a nice advantage for farming more gold or for pvping. Certain points in vanilla crafted gear is quite strong as well. And lastly once guilds have the drops they need they are more than happy to sell powerful raid drops for gold. I can certainly see why people think tokens are pay to win, however I don't see much difference between 3rd party gold farmers and tokens besides tokens causing less inflation.
---
Doesn't pass the smell test for leveling IMO. From experience, Priest is one of the slower classes at leveling, while Druids and Warlocks are right up there with Hunters as the fastest. There's a lot more to it than just killing stuff.
---
Or you can be patient and use this build https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGp0cbx It is a bit more aggressive in the sense that you can load up reckoning charges by force sitting and getting a reckbomb ready and taking the fight to them. I would probably recommene using SoR with this and a really slow 2 hander with at least 3.4 speed. Plus having a reduced cd on hammer of justice is nice, couple with the higher armor rating and improved conc aura for annoying casters is handy.
---
I think you may have accidentally responded to the incorrect person.
---
okay but give me some examples of hardcore/casual that don't conform to my investment:return concept then.
---
besides i just figure when someone's post is immediately downvoted its from the person they replied to, because they're the ones who would have just received the notification, right?. i'm not self-righteous i'm just cynical.
---
People love to outrage first then research later, it's no surprise. 
---
Will they listen? Who knows.
---
Im almost positive there will be limitations per server. Even private servers do this
---
Pentium 4
---
ATI Radeon 9600
---
512MB RAM
---
15” CRT
---
Ran it fine in 2006 at least :D
---
how they do dat limitation? like if there are alot of horde you can't make another horde?
---
Yup, you start feeling pretty good, getting into a good groove, and then you get siphon life and it's great. I just leveled a warlock on a pserver, dinged 60 with crap gear from lvl 30ish.
---
"Private server" Fuck outta here.
---
For alot of people WoW was their first mmo and they had no idea what raiding was. By the time a lot of them had figured out how mmo's work they were already well into TBC. This time around more of the gaming community understands mmo's and a lot more people will complete the content.  
---
I mean imagine being a new player never having played wow before and you start playing in 1.9. There's such a small chance that you'd be able to clear kelthuzad before TBC launch it's basically impossible. My guild was in naxxaramas and killed 6 bosses. The moment TBC was on the horizon our raid just died. People just didn't see any point in raiding anymore and stopped logging on. Not saying we would of killed kel'thuzad but we definitely would of killed more bosses given more time.
---
Please try r/wowservers for private server gameplay discussion.
---
Ah, yeah. Read about reck bombing. So is it possible to charge reckoning on a lower lvl mob and then just carry it until i attack?
---
You think rogue would be the fastest to lvl 5??
---
I can't wait to see all the people calling BFA hard and vanilla casual actually play vanilla and can barely get to level 20 because quests are too hard. Literally can't freaking wait.
---
Sorry I should have said “whichever war in the {insert_impoverished_country_or_region} the US gov is starting this week”
---
correct, it persist as long as you dont switch gear.
---
sometimes i wish this. but what if you made some real life commitments that you couldn't easily back out of, and then they announce classic is coming out? so i'm glad they told us so i can plan for a clear schedule.
---
I tested spirit warrior levelling before, it's 100% worth it - especially pre 40. You have 0 downtime. Spirit increases your levelling speed to a much greater degree than str per point, as it reduces your downtime by a TON, whereas strength (especially at low lvl) is pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
---
Oh, that's really sick! Probably gonna try that. Thanks a lot, my man!
---
These are fantastic! They are all going in my wallpapers folder.
---
I never had an issue with addiction back in the day, I actually used WoW as a way to reward myself for doing chores/homework and such instead.
---
But I think one thing people can take solace in is that classic is going to be around for more than just 2 years. If people are playing WoW as hardcore as they say they will be, then they're eventually going to run out of the type of content that might require their poop socking tendencies.
---
The fact that there's an end to the gear/raiding grind at some point is actually one thing that is really enticing to me. No more worrying about an xpac making my gear obsolete or needing to accomplish everything in 2 years time. My plan is to gear up and then just play AV/AB.
---
Aye consumers are willing to pay, but the reason is psychological manipulation, not genuine desire. Most people who play loot box infested games do so in very limited ways, often not paying a dime. The real target audience are the 'whales' (which is the industries own term for them). These people are fellas with a pre existing condition for addictive tendencies. I know something of the matter, studying psychology, though most of it is certainly reading what more learned people have written. I wish i was exaggerating, as you would like to believe i am, but this path and practice is very much ruining the industry and the lives of many people both. You may wish to say who cares, to ignore and forget, but i for one won't be joining you.
---
These 'Whales' are everything from young children to the elderly, and even the most stout industry defender must surely see that selling gambling to kids, maliciously manipulating money out of the elderly etc, is wrong. Not that there is a debate on the subject though, if there was we wouldn't be seeing entire countries getting involved in the matter.
---
Ret is not very good in PvE. You can DPS in dungeons, but retribution paladins are among the least desired specs in raids. With enough gear, you can probably heal 5 mans as ret eventually, but ret just doesn't provide anything that holy doesn't, and every other traditional DPS class deals more damage than a ret pally. I don't really have a spec recommendation for ya. Ret does find the most success in PvP, but it's not very strong in PvP either. It's not great, but if you want to play ret, that's probably your best bet.

---
Literally doesn't matter. You have Naxx on farm when you get Atiesh. You do not need to do anything to progress your raid.
---
I think it should be a PvP toy for Druids. 420 attack power in Feral forms AND 300 bonus healing is completely insane.  That Druid is going to get way more personal enjoyment out of it than a Mage or Warlock. I guarantee he will be loyal to whatever guild gave it to him for a loooooooong time.
---
Teeb makes the best graphical stuff 👌👌
---
It could work as long as the creator was willing to assign custom values to each item that way items that are lower item level, but better itemized (hit etc) would be valued correctly.
---
Still hope no one ever creates them because it leads to people requiring gear that isn't remotely required to complete the content.
---
I wish I wasn't asked by a mate, I was happy, now I'm miserable
---
Dude i got you, let me look inside my magical book of answers for things that haven't come out yet.
---
I guess, but there we are clearly in min-max territory.
---
What I meant by "feeling" the race choice was that you will have to make decisions that others don't at one point, simply because you are an Orc with good alternatives. 
---
Axe of the Deep Woods (can be bought with gold), Deathbringer and Crulshoruk are really nice weapons until you hit on Kel'thuzad after all.
---
And in a guild environment it would make sense to me tp keep that in mind when distributing loot, if you have the luxury of a diverse racial tanking setup.
---
You can build a lot of offset pieces while tanking dungeons especially if you're the only warrior in the group. As for raid gear, that'll all depend on your guild's loot system. Prot isn't used too frequently in PvP, but is pretty useful for tanking objectives in Alterac Valley.
---
I think they're just going to implement it together with your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account and work just like the normal one now.
---
Crusader on main hand, agi on off hand.  Main hand weapon procs off abilities and auto attack.
---
Ever stop to think autocorrect is what got me? I simply didn't care enough to fix it. Also, have you learned irony yet?
---
Yup. I stopped paying attention when they announced it back in 2017 because I knew it was gonna be a while before it came out. Now that I saw it’s only a couple of months away, I spend a good amount of time watching YouTube videos on classic and checking the Reddit
---
You need to specify your budget a bit better, breaking the bank can be pretty subjective.
---
Generally I'd recommend getting a 144hz 1440p monitor, but if you can't afford it, then 1080p 144hz is good too. 
---
You should go on pcpartpicker and look at monitors on there, you can filter by refresh rate, resolution, IPS, etc and sort by price.
---
Just fucking play it. Are you fucking kidding? You want a tool? Play the fucking game.
---
Which DPS class will do best with their "endgame" gear being r10 PvP gear and a weapon that is acquirable without being in a raiding guild?  Similar question with a possibly different answer - which class has the best itemized r10 PvP gear?
---
r/4PanelCringe
---
YA JUST PLAY WOW CLASSIC SINCE ITS OUT RIGHT NOW. Or do you mean a private server? Why dont you just say that ya asswipe
---
Not sure. you can download your own pserver core and make one of each though.
---
Was a blast. Funnier then most memes too.
---
See this guy gets it.
---
Sorry I should have been more specific. Probably looking to spend $400 for something that’s 27 inch. I’ll check out partpicker, thanks
---
I miss kiting those unkillable mobs from the dark portal. Blasted lands
---
It's a shame such a toxic comment is upvoted so much. I expect better of this subreddit.
---
I mean, the common non selfish perception of what is good and right. Is that when your money and time directly interfere or hinder other people is when it matters.
---
Do you openly advocate that steroids aren't cheating? And that it's their body why are you testing them?
---
Yeah, but given time Naxx will end up on farm once everyone's gear equalizes out in the end and people are familiar with what to do by heart. I won't doubt that by four years time a good deal of cloth casters will have Atiesh.
---
The end game is true end game here. Once you get the best that's really it.
---
I'm happy they announced it early, gave me the chance to play on a pserver and learn everything that has changed and make my mistakes there. I also changed classes during that time and decided on Druid for Classic.
---
&gt; Leveling with a partner is extremely common 
---
Eh, could be reasonably common but it's pretty hard to stick to the same levels at the same time and in the same zones with the same quests as others. It's uncommon to be leveling directly with others outside of multiboxing; the whole "but what about husband &amp; wife pairs" still is victim to one of the players outleveling the other for whatever reason, making it less efficient.
---
Of course, random players making random groups to poke random mobs together is the most common occurrence of all of this, but even this is serendipitous and lasts for a quest or two worth of mobs &amp; experience at a time
---
My favorite zones epl and wpl
---
This topic is new and exciting !
---
Summer 2019
---
Probably June-July. Usually, the more you anticipate getting a release date, the longer it actually takes for them to announce it
---
Not sure if I should apologize for skewing the data so much. I read nearly every post that gets put up on this subreddit. The hype has been real since the day Classic was announced! I’m also glad to see more subs arriving every day. Can. Not. Wait.
---
Yes they will lock character creation for factions that are too high on server.
---
I'm late but surprised no one's mentioned [Seal of Wrynn](https://itemization.info/item/2933). It was a great change; it was the final reward after a long quest chain and it was pretty underwhelming to get a green ring with stam/spirit.
---

"According to that formula, the 12th week you'd have 65136 Rating Points, so from rank 0 to 14 you had to be Standing 1 for 12 weeks in a row"

For rogue in PVP, is daggers or combat sword better?
---
This is actually like *really* fucking good. I’d love to use it in a video at some point!
---
Students :(
---
Would you like to know more?
---
Plus you have to deal with looking at trolls feet the whole time. Your armor and weapon may look badass but how badass can you be with those 2 toed monstrosities drawing all the attention?
---
People always say it has nothing to do with skill, and I still don't really believe them. Mind if I play devil's advocate here?
---
Current pserver player. I miss nearly every iron grenade I throw, and I screw up half of the combos/predictions I need to make in an average (lvl 30-50ish) duel. 
---
OK, I concede that the top rank person is not necessarily the best person, but everyone playing in these premades is performing up to a standard that is far above and beyond any that I (a casual) have ever lived up to. Their knowledge of combos, engineering items, consumables, and spell kits is also far above anything I've ever had.
---
I think when people say there is no skill involved, they are just so used to playing high level pvp for so many hours that they forget how few wow players can actually do that.
---
Many people are giving good examples in this thread. I'm not really interested in using your model to talk about it because its cumbersome and honestly I'm only here on my phone because my wifi is out at the moment.
---
The basic jist of it is that generally when people say casual they don't necessarily mean low skill/low effort. More accurately, a casual player is someone who doesn't have the time to invest in acquiring better skills, or putting a lot of effort towards something. In this regard, classic can be seen as a very casual game, because you can log in and be rewarded through self-fulfillment and enjoyment even if you aren't on the cutting edge, even if you aren't investing a lot of time and effort. You can work towards goals like reps which have value, you can farm some gold and play the AH which has value. Essentially classic is a living world with a functioning economy and you can take part in that in small, yet still meaningful ways. Very good for casual enjoyment.
---
Meanwhile retail is piss easy and unfulfilling, and despite being easy, requires an enormous amount of time to get any kind of enjoyment out of the game. Want to do transmog? Get a character to max level and farm 7 expansions worth of raids and dungeons and reps and dailies every week. Want to do some casual dungeon content and slowly push a mythic key? Better farm WQs, mythic 0s, LFR, waterfronts, etc in order to get your ilvl high enough for people to give you the time of day. The examples go on. The only things that one might consider enjoyable and fulfilling in retail wow require you to dedicate hours upon hours each week doing easy content you gain no enjoyment from in order to achieve your goal. Even something as simple as leveling alts, a go-to "casual" activity, is stripped of all fun and meaning in retail.
---
Is vanilla casual? Yes and no. If you want it to be casual, it can be. If you want it to be hardcore, it can be. The game is what you make of it, open and flexible, and offers many fulfilling options and goals for the different types of players depending on their level of investment.
---
That's my take. I just think the way you define it is arbitrarily narrow. The terms casual and hardcore are naturally vague, just like any other dichotomy that attempts to place an entire population into two boxes. Speaking of boxes, I also wouldn't consider lootboxes casual or hardcore, they're just cancer in general.

---
O well looks like im dying young 😵
---
Private servers overtune the crap out of raid bosses and guilds still smash through them.
---
To be fair though if there are tokens people will be furious.
---
When did Reddit become tumblr
---
I think everything is going to use the 1.12 incarnations besides the announced changes
---
Years ago...
---
The only one in for a shock will be you when you realize how braindead easy vanilla is.
---
Yeah, definitely look in the direction of high refresh rate 1440p monitors then 1440p is really nice. Beyond that there's extra options, like a few monitors support 165hz, some are IPS and some have variable refresh rate technology such as gsync or freesync, it's down to you if you want them or not. Those extras obviously increase the price.
---
Did they ever do this in retail WoW? I don't remember this. I've always played on PvE servers so I wouldn't know
---
That was beautiful. I can't wait. Personally, I always played as a horde that didn't mind alliance but hated humans specifically and would abuse any human I found. Was fun to rp as a homicidal maniac.
---
Hi, /u/Altnob
---
Yup, my dota friends don't understand why I don't play with them anymore.
---
I think it depends. I believe in some cases a fast dagger in main hand and slow sword in off hand is good. Just look into whatever spec tree your going with and see what bonuses you get from which weapons.
---
Dunno but ive played plenty of mmos that have and even wow pservers do
---
Just remember what it costs to change specs.  Not cheap
---
True, but I firmly believe tokens will only be in Classic so far as being able to buy a token in the Retail auction house with gold in Retail for game time.  
---
Everything this Classic dev team has done to date seems to confirm this. How they are handling this project and the “in” versus “out” is really all we need to look at for confirmation on this stuff.
---
Realistically, any guild that is serious about progression isn't going to give a piece of gear thats useful for someones main raiding role for someones offset. 
---
So basically as soon as that gear drops, and no one needs it for their main raiding spec, that is when it would happen typically. I would classify this under "a very long time".
---
Do I have to spec into tank/healer to be accepted into leveling dungeons?
---
Yeah, but if WoW hasn't done it in the 12 years its been out (people have been bitching and moaning about faction imbalance for years now), I can't imagine they'll do it just for WoW Classic.
---
I don't think they do this for present day BfA players.
---
See and i think the main issue that both vanilla and pservers share is interest in naxx
---
In vanilla there was the announcement of tbc which meant a gear reset and people didnt give a whoot about naxx ( as you have stated)
---
Pservers that make it to naxx die because there is always a fresh server on the horizon that kills guilds. And we all know the *F R E S H* meme
---
But the biggest issue is that once you get that first kt kill, after spending months of farming consumes to have them wiped away by some idiot, people just want the kill and then quit. Leaving some caster with 29 shards and non raiding guild with his phalice dangling in his hand
---
Do mage/lock also have wand builds like that, or does the same general rule apply, to finish off guys with wand?
---
Ugh, how cool would it be if they surprise released it in the next few days. Everything is always a delay. I'd love a surprise early release.
---
Not only will I likely shelve all other games, but Classic will also be my farewell to Blizzard in general. 
---
I will enjoy one of their greatest games one last time and then never look back, no matter how fancy the cinematic of their new stuff looks like. Got burned too many times in the past few years.
---
Which pserver do you play on?
---
I'd be pretty heartbroken and feel very betrayed if they put in gold tokens.
---
Just crack down super hard on gold sellers. Don't directly implement a method for pay to Win. Totally ruins the entire soul of vanilla.
---
If I am duo leveling, and my partner can’t sign on, what is best to do? pvp? Level another toon?
---
Honestly nothing in your post refutes the fact that it’s laziness. You just gave some alternative explanation about why the casual-nostalgia player base won’t realize that this is unfun because they won’t realize (or are too lazy to care) that there’s an alternative to everyone having a bis set of mismatched dungeon blues until AQ. 
---
Actually your last sentence is my point summed up exactly. It sounds like we basically agree aside from on *why* blizzard chose to do it this way. Maybe it’s not totally laziness but it’s at least “Let’s make it simple for the sake of simplicity for the players” which is the exact mentality that took us away from what Vanilla was.
---
The difference is that potions and grenades are consumables. If you use them in a duel you are just throwing away gold to try and get an edge in the fight. Gear/enchants are permanent and help you in all situations.
---
They are not putting tokens in Classic.
---
But do you remember what that was? I can't remember.
---
what.  spriest is great leveling.  good mana regen and damage as long as you have an up to date wand.
---
World pvp hasnt mattered since vanilla.
---
Its to bad that atiesh isnt BIS for mages
---
It recall it being steonger for you to have soulkeeper off of KT and another mage providing you with the buff if you want to min max
---
Now lets be real, if the loot master says "pick up the shards because your making the staff" 
---
Im gonna grab those shards
---
it's literally not tho, at all.  you don't have the mana pool to swap into cat form multiple times in the same fight (as in, 3-4 times per trash pull) nor do you have a reason to because it isnt worth it because your damage will be dogshit anyway
---
Good question, wanna know where to spam LFG
---
Ret sham warrior all have slower leveling times but i wouldn't say leveling speed is dreadful for any class just slower before level 20 when you start to get more dps abilities. And i wouldn't even worry about rotation at this point, keep in mind your going to get so many hours to develop the best rotation that works for you and in certain situations. As ret you will be doing alot of auto attacking but you guys get some really useful spells in pvp and pve. You can wear plate armour at 40 so i can only imagine leveling will get alot easier after that. When it comes to healing most healing classes can heal low level dungeons up until mid 30s where it will start to get harder for you to heal because of mana. But that doesn't mean you cannot hold on to healing gear that you may find while you are on your journeys, and use it for healing in dungeons.
---
I'm going to hold you to this! I want to believe.
---
Fury. Bitterness. Fun. The first two perversely often lead to the third. 
---
Some areas you’ll be friendly, helpful, opposite faction members pulls too many mobs and you’ll give him a hand to stop that poor lad having a 2 minute walk back from graveyard. 
---
Other areas you’ll get killed while fighting a mob by that piece of shit that you decided to spare and walked past as he was fighting a mob , you’ll snap and take manic joy in destroying as many as you can with extreme prejudice throughout the area. 
---
The hate, and the bigotry, is honestly just great fun. The slow levelling of vanilla WoW leads to a really immersive experience where everyone is quite committed, and it really adds life and passion to Horde v Alliance dynamic.
---
To prove my point I didn’t even realise that I ordered Horde before Alliance in previous paragraph despite alphabetical order. I’m legitimately subconsciously biased because fuck you you alliance fuck. 
---
It’s really really great fun, and I couldn’t recommend a PvP realm more when it finally launches. You’d be surprised how enjoyable getting ganked by some asshole and losing your real life time as a result is in the grand scheme.
---
The way i see it: im gunna gave a blast in those 2 years.
---
Classic runs on retail base. Still doesn't need much, but it's a 1.12 body on a 7.3.5 chassis
---
I played vanilla recently because I was so hyped about classic. I thought I would play all day long for weeks but I got tired of it faster than I thought. It is entertaining and I'm probably going to no life the game the first weeks in order to get ahead, however I know that I'm going to truly enjoy the game only for the first 4-7 hours I play a day, and the 10 or so hours after that I'm gonna be tired of grinding for levels but I will keep at it. I guess it's not addiction I just want to reach my goals fast. Get to 60, find a semi-hardcore guild, and after reaching 70-80% bis I'm gonna go back to my normal life and log in for the weekly guild raids and pvp (for a few hours).
---
If you mean 30 minutes before release, yes. A month would be too long still.
---
I would maybe work on gathering and crafting? Make some gold for that epic mount.
---
Hi, /u/canihaveyournumba
---
You put it better than I did. It’s Blizzard’s new design philosophy guiding their approach to vanilla WoW. 
---
Maybe it’s not laziness, but if it’s “let’s make this simpler for the players”, that’s almost worse as it’s exactly the handholding mentality that ruined WoW over the years.
---
yeah bs starts with mail
---
You don’t HAVE to but if for sure helps. When I was leveling my warrior I was fury spec but I kept a tank set Incase I wanted to do a dungeon. It’s a nightmare leveling a warrior as Protection ( tank spec)
---
5, and 1.
---
I'll have 2 accounts, and 2 box my main and my bank alt to 5 at the same time.
---
Bank alt will eventually make her way to the IF bridge as a bank alt / DE bot / etc.
---
2nd account will then log into a level 1 toon and run to location A to camp a vendor. Then log into another level 1 toon and camp location B vendor, then C, D, E, F, G, H, I
---
So 1 main leveling to 60. One level 5. Nine level 1s (maybe 2 if they get exploration XP.)
---
You want 7 points in affliction for 5/5 imp corruption and 2/2 imp life tap. After that you can pick whatever you want, demo is very viable.
---
That's what I heard but people said "just throw on a shield and you can tank"
---
I would love to work for blizzard but I despise Cali.
---
Once you get siphon life you start feeling like the dot master, the extra damage and healing is just so useful. And it only gets better from there.
---
Searing pain has a short cast time and can be used to quickly finish off a weak target. If I remember correctly it also has increased aggro, so you can steal aggro from other players which is nice when teaming up (especially melee mobs have to run to you first while the dots are ticking), you can also grab aggro from the healer (better her/him than you).
---
Yes.
---
Yeah you shouldn’t have to be Prot until the end game dungeons.
---
Nah, mana back only works with the Priest talent [Spirit Tap](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=15338). And it doesn't have to be a wand; it'll proc even if you deal the killing blow with damage from any source. Mages have an improved wand talent, but both locks and mages deal much more damage and have many more methods of killing mobs than Priests.
---
Oh okay gotcha
---
\*downvotes you to oblivion\* stupid huntard!
---
i like where this is going
---
Pepehands that it isnt BIS  for mages...
---
If we talking minmax then as a mage you wa t another mage to provide you with the buff and i believe you just use KT weapon if you really wanted to the best geared mage
---
My dude I love vanilla for many reasons but if you honestly think that players who have the APM required to play their class even semi-effectively in retail are going to struggle with classic then you're just misguided. If retail players dont like vanilla it will be because it's too slow paced for them and they dont feel like acclimating to the environment, not because they can't figure out the mechanical complexity of auto attacking 12 boars to death.
---
heh ok
---
&gt; getting a mount at 40
---
Oh dear.
---
Is it good for shaman?
---
yes
---
I remember some people would get pissed if you asked in the trade channel but I think that was the most effective. The trade channel was connected to all the major cities. Otherwise you’d be left with general chat or whispering people.
---
If we can make chat channels that are global, I’m sure each server would make their own that would become the norm
---
or perhaps you haven't been watching enough?
---
Blacksmith starts out making mail and then shifts more to making plate.
---
About the time that BS shifts to crafting plate great, Leatherworking shifts to crafting mail. However, if memory serves correctly, you only get a few mail pieces as a Leatherworker unless you pick the appropriate specialization. Though I could be misremembering, and specializations weren't added until Burning Crusade.
---
Its meant to be Medivhs staff from WC3. It fit him well, but its design did not do it any favors in terms of looking good in an mmo bk then.
---
End game raids for sure, that’s the biggest thing I want to do
---
Vekor cheesed the bat when it was op still good player and not a bad character always helpful. 
---
Ah, BS on SM. Fun times especially crashing server intentionally during AQ opening or clearing MC 5 times a week. Meh had no life back then... In the video you can make out Domali (GL), Shrike, Delish... and ARmBG oh god ARMBG you never knew who was playing that shaman...
---
You should look up Caen's videos from the same era.
---
Priests get a lot stronger at level 40. I you had a levelling race 40-60 priests would definitely be up there with hunters and locks (if you banned mage aoe). They are slow 0-40 which I think makes them fairly average levellers overall, but yeah kill speed and sustain after 45 is no problem at all.
---
Hope you enjoy it. WoD had a lot of good in it, but I couldn’t enjoy it since the game was just so bloated and hollow from what it used to be. Same goes with Legion, which is every modern players favorite xpac. 
---
If you can help it, try to stay clean off of private servers for the next 3 months. It’s fun to dabble, but it would be great to have your first experience be tied to the game that’s not going to vanish in three months, but instead stay active forever.
---
Lmfao
---
World PvP hasn't mattered since Vanilla, eh? You do realize you're posting this on a subreddit dedicated to WoW Classic, which by definition is intended to be a return to Vanilla, right?
---
Not for long I didn’t.
---
30 minutes?
---
What if you were at work 
---
I’d say a week , that way I can setup my vacation/sick leave
---
Feint too. Energy doesn't matter if you die.
---
Makes sense. I thought about that too but I think Id raid Holy. I know Troll is more min max but I still kind of want to be Undead. I think Im set on Priest but not so sure about if I should min max or not. Not sure exactly how much the Troll racial matters.
---
This has never been a forged thing in WoW. The closest Blizz had ever come to anything remotely resembling this was free server transfers for members of one faction or the other off of a server that was heavily skewed towards that faction to specific servers that were heavily skewed in favor of the other faction.
---
So as an example: Server A is 98% Alliance and 2% Horde, while Server B is 96% Horde and 4% Alliance. Blizzard would occasionally offer free server transfers for Alliance players from Server A to Server B (but not B to A, and not for Horde going in either direction) to try to provide incentives for people to self-correct the imbalance on the two servers.
---
But as far as straight up going "Too many Horde, you can only create Alliance on this server for the time being" has never been a thing they've done.
---
You can still compete with just 12 hours brother I believe in you
---
I feel the same as you. I like to do all quests and dungeons while leveling, also I want to grind for my professions. This means I overlevel stuff and usually abandon some quests or skip a dungeon. I might avoid rested xp this time, but it's hard to pass up on the free xp.
---
Every private server I have played on had horrible faction balance ,just because orc and undead had the best racials for pvp.
---
&gt;  More accurately, a casual player is someone who doesn't have the time to invest in acquiring better skills, or putting a lot of effort towards something.
---
so in your own words, they can't or won't invest or put forth effort to obtain something. they don't want to partake in hardcore investment:return mechanics. they want to partake in casual investment:return mechanics.
---
&gt; Is vanilla casual? Yes and no. If you want it to be casual, it can be. If you want it to be hardcore, it can be. The game is what you make of it, open and flexible, and offers many fulfilling options and goals for the different types of players depending on their level of investment.
---
you're again describing any activity in life pretty much. you say i'm too narrow but imo you're being pretty broad.
---
i booted up half-life the other day. it can be a casual experience or a hardcore one depending on the difficulty i choose. and the gameplay is open and flexible, allowing me many options (weapons and tools) to conquer the goals i set for myself depending on my level of investment and goals set (speed running, using only certain weapons, killing zero enemies, etc).
---
thanks for taking the time to post something though.
---
That is possible, but it's like reraising in poker when you're holding an ace high.  If you get stuck with an item for more than you wanted to pay for it because someone else also bid high, it's inherently your fault for bidding more than it was worth to you.  In my experience, it's worth it to use proxy bidding to remove the specter of officer cheating.  I've been in that kind of guild before, and it only takes a couple of people losing by 1dkp legitimately to assume there's cheating going on.
---
Kek
---
I'm aware, but again, they've never done it in the entire time WoW has been out, and they definitely never did it in Vanilla WoW.
---
I think it would be really naive to expect them to add that now lol
---
Exactly why im hoping they release server names prior. Definitly want to avoid the zerg from private servers just so it will be a bit easier to make gold/ control the market imo.
---
Just look at which servers the big streamers and guilds are rolling on and avoid those. That’s your best shot imo.
---
Stop being poor and go
---
I live right next to South Shore Drive - every time I leave my house I am reminded that I just want to turn around and go back to Azeroth.
---
If you want good gear for a shaman go leatherworking and specialize in dragon scale at level 40. It offers great mail for a shaman 40-60.
---
I don't think this is the right place for a question like this.
---
I'm taking 8 weeks off midway through December.  
---
Family holiday = 1 week  
---
Home Renovations = 2 weeks  
---
Wow = every waking moment in between!
---
Prot is not even slightly viable in pvp.
---
Get a different repack?
---
Go buy a big ass bag of lentils or take on more debt
---
Most amount of human feces on sidewalks, most homeless tent cities, most likely state to step on a needle while on the beach, highest taxes in the country, most congested roads in the country, massive amounts of gang activity, and no right to defend yourself or your family, to boot!
---
But it has like, the beach and the mountains. And weed! No other states have those, right?

The threat is a non issue on alliance.
---
On horde, unless you have a shaman in your group dropping tranquil air, you can pull aggro at will if you know what you’re doing.
---
I mean i have no faith in ion but i do in the classic dev team
---
I’ve never leveled horde in vanilla so I’d like to get a 50+ (maybe 60 if I like it) horde toon after my alliance main’s at 60.
---
But can’t u just equip atiesh whenever u don’t want to use a MCP charge in the boss fight? Or while it’s on cool down?
---
Worried?!? This was my plan all along. I spent over $2200 on a gaming laptop and curved 32" monitor. I told parents and my friends that I have absolutely no interest in being introduced to available ladies. I stockpiled days off. I'm praying this happens
---
Yeah id say dont bother, retail will just kill your hype more then anything
---
Just wait till you can emerge from that crypt or stand before the abbey and feel the feels wash over you, your home
---
I think think I could ever turn my back on my racing games. It fills the void of not being able to race real cars anymore because they are too expensive to keep going.
---
People are going to be more excited about finally getting the release date than they will be when it actually comes out lmaooo
---
Right and the argument is, world pvp hasnt mattered since vanilla so theyve had no reason to balance factions per server making classic more prone to them doing so.
---
?
---
Hi, /u/BestThereEverWas0101
---
"axes if evil" - 3 inches of blood. Totally about Arthas.
---
When I played vanilla, there were a ton of really bad rank 10+. 
---
We have 15 years worth of knowledge in how rating systems can work. We can have a better system. The focus should be on improving the quality of play, not trying to artificially lengthen the hours put in 
---
People shouldn't be competing with each other on time spent (to a minimum), but on proficiency. Time spent should be about improving that proficiency, not fulfilling the nolife requirement. (and the account-sharing requirement)
---
If you only play on modern private server, that's 15 years of time to strengthen the playerbase. Vanilla-era players allowed it because they had to, it was new. Unless we know more about xrealm and server info, we can assume most realms will have a garbage PvP scene, and the ones with an acceptable one will just become overpopulated or faction imbalanced.
---
I'd say current leveling is actually massively unfriendly to casual players. And much more friendly to hardcore players. The leveling process is easy as fuck with a watered down, broken story line that doesn't offer anything fulfilling besides a handful of neat cutscenes. Idk about you, but I dont feel accomplished when I finish a BFA zone. Instead the feeling I get is more like I just looked down at my grocery list, saw everything was checked off, and now I can finally head to checkout and leave the store.
---
This system is good for players who want to obliterate the leveling process and have a max level alt ready to go in a day. It's actually a very poor system for someone who wants to go through the content slowly, savoring and enjoying it during their precious free time off work, and working towards a fulfilling goal off in the distance.
---
Classic wow offers a leveling experience that is much more fulfilling to a casual player. The content is slow, but meaningful, with every play session offering you another talent, another couple pieces of meaningful gear, a new spell here and there, and the wonderful feeling of getting that level up noise and knowing you're one step closer to your goal. Not only that, but you can level professions which are actually important, and have value in the economy. You could spend your entire classic existence farming and selling light leather and copper ore in loch modan and come out with friendships and connections to higher level players who need the materials for their alts or leveling engineering for pvp. Doing the most menial shit in a level 20 zone ends up being meaningful because of the economy and the connections you form with other players.
---
In retail you just blow through all the content and the game says "okay now farm WQs alone over and over, or queue for some random soulless warfronts/dungeons/islands, have fun." Even farming out cosmetics like transmog, pets, and mounts requires a max level character and a substantial time investment for weekly resets, dailies, etc. Retail is pretty garbage if you're looking for fulfilling casual content.
---
This isn't my site so props to the creators (they are listed on the website). Hoping this hadn't already been posted yet!
---
Putting tokens on classic would kill it day 1.  
---
  They're not that stupid.
---
There is a meme spec for melee hunters in raids which is to wield a nightfall axe. Your gameplay boils down to spamming r1 wing clip to get the nightfall axe proc which will benefit your raid.
---
Outside of raids, nope, not practical.
---
Also if you were deadly serious you wouldn't play a Tauren, it'd be Orc.
---
I truly believe that if you are going to be on a PVE server, there's no reason not to be on an RP server, unless you're strictly intent on being quick to raiding.
---
Even for a non-rper, RP servers really amplify that sense that there are people just "living" in this MMORPG, giving it an organic feeling. The downside is often that, barring one or two guilds that are made up of the hardcores of the entire server, the raid scene tends to fall behind.
---
But yes, raiding is harder to get into. For Moonguard, for example, there's the guild Pact on Ally-side which is quite high up there (not compared to guilds from _Illidan_ maybe) and then kind of nothing else, ally-side. Horde has a similar issue.
---
That being said, assuming we don't get any new raids coming out, the almost painfully slow progress some guilds will make seems like it'd be perfectly fine to me.
---
yes but they were put into the game to be used. the mats farmed so they can be made so they can be used. It seems silly to not use whatever you have at your disposal. I feel like the people who started or pushed for these trends are the ones who did go engineering or alchemy and since they couldn't use it to their advantage, didn't want anyone else to it against them. Now i feel like people should used everything and anything they can. Being the best means using everything you have.
---
I have never found a balanced pvp server. Private servers where the worst as they where all horde dominated.
---
Professions, grinding, PvP, dungeons for gear. Just leave quests to do with him.
---
It would be a fun experiment, but definitely not ideal. There are quite a few talents that "benefit" melee in the survival tree, but the remainder of your talents will probably go in beast mastery and your pet will end up being the bulk of your damage I would think. Hunters just weren't made to be a melee class - they lack the mechanics and melee attack power doesn't scale as well as ranged.
---
You will also notice that a lot of the talents are designed as ways to get range on an opponent, as that is where you're dangerous (e.g. entrapment/counter).
---
Yes, you can dual wield 1h swords, but I think that 2h is preferred in PvP.
---
...Holy shit, really?  I was used to Salv in Wrath....i assumed thats how it always was.
---
Jeez, i thought i knew most of the spell differences by now...
---
The warsong one is cool :)
---
If dps is your thing look at a hunter, a little more to do specially of you kite a few things and micro the pet
---
Meanwhile one of the more recent and populated private servers is Alliance dominated
---
You described a balanced pvp realm, good luck finding one of those
---
Dominance, my son
---
I'd say that's less of a hardcore vs casual and more of a do you enjoy leveling type of player. Personally I don't enjoy leveling all that much after the 1st experience whether its classic or retail. I can see where you're coming from and agree with the comparison except for the fact that a lot of casual players don't play for the leveling experience either.
---
I would play a TBC legacy server and be more excited for that than classic. Anything after that I likely wouldn't be super interested in. I'd be open to them also releasing new content for classic, but I think the chances of that happening are pretty much zero.
---
Blacksmithing is absolutely not worth it even a little bit unless you're the guild blacksmith of a decent raiding guild. Then at least you have a purpose and access to some great plans. Otherwise it is a MASSIVE waste of potential money. Honestly, Engineering is more useful than Blacksmithing by a fair margin. Especially for PvP
---
I'm guessing they'll have notice. They know it's important to a lot of people.
---
But why do you need to be the ‘best’ in a friendly duel?
---
Mhm, and this is why blizzard had to introduce cross sever battlegrounds which in turned hurt world PvP and server identity. If we don't try and balance the servers i think it's going to lead to some changes people wont like.
---
flag carrier.
---
What is MCP, and why does it contain "charges"?
---
I believe I will enjoy Classic, but I would enjoy tBC more. WOTLK had some nice features, but it subtracted along the way. Whereas tBC just refined Vanilla, and added to.
---
Hunter can choose all of them.
---
Are you prepared to heal those end game raids, and to only use 1 spell at 1 rank to heal 99.99% of the time? Then go paladin. 
---
If not, sounds like warlock is your jam.
---
I'd go with leatherworking. If you're really desperate for any low level stuff you can always ask another blacksmith to make it for you.
---
Honestly I'm not a huge fan of world PvP, especially since I plan on playing a warrior, it's gank city. But I will still probably roll on a PvP server because I would like the option to PvP even though I might not. Also because I'm stupid.
---
I don't care - there is only one faction to roll: Horde
---
I feel like the ONLY way it wouldn’t ravage Vanilla is if they made it ONLY a gold sink. No selling tokens for in game gold, only buying tokens.
---
They shouldn’t add it in at all (there’s retail for that anyways... it has no use in vanilla imo), but if they did, I would hope it’s only as a gold sink.
---
If this is a regular thing between you two, I strongly recommend you to create another toon so you can dump all the time into that one. We had the same problem a decade ago and this is how we solved it.
---
For pvp Maces is OPAF. Chance to stun on hit. Yes please.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler, a weapon that drops from a Gnomer boss.
---
Has 3 charges that give the user attack speed for a while. Druids get so much from the weapon that it's not unheard of for a druid to farm a bunch of them before a raid.
---
Its classic, you don't need to do anything. Personally if i'm outside the major cities dualing people i like to figure out ground rules. Me personally i like using everything that's in the game as it makes me try harder and want to be more competitive. My view is, some classes are designed to wreck other classes but engineering and pots can reduce the advantage gap. If someone just wants to smack each other around then ill dual and half ass it.
---
This is is scared of holy warriors with magic. Do it
---
Wasn’t there a time they both could proc or am I misremembering and there would just sometimes be overlapping procs. Or was that even just a temp bug?
---
Doesn't mean anything if both people aren't trying their best. If it doesn't mean anything then we're both just wasting time. If we're both just wasting time then who cares what's used?
---
&gt; Im almost positive there will be limitations per server. Even private servers do this
---
And Blizzard has NEVER done this. They have even explicitly stated in years passed that they will not do it. The best they have ever done was offer free transfers off the overpopulated side.
---
Be in able to buy game time with gold isn't horrible.
---
Being able to buy gold with money is!
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler, has an on-use of gaining a melee attack speed boost, and has charges, something like 3 charges before its just a weapon.
---
Faster attacks means more clear cast procs, and you can get a few bags full of them for a raid, and swap them out to boost your dps on every fight.
---
It's simple, you quit the job mysteriously.
---
Druids, rogues, mages, and hunters are much better flag carriers than warriors. Prot warriors are just not viable for anything pvp except AV tanking.
---
I'm not terrible at the game so I'd honestly just be too embarrassed to ever roll on a pve server.
---
Absolutely not. Try getting on a private server and practicing your route rather than paging through reddit all day
---
Absolutely not.  It’s a meme for sure.  If we are talking about optimization of anything nightelf priest is not the way to go.  
---
Honestly if we are talking about speeding up leveling speed the best I could say for ally is humans with the spirit so you can possibly spam more spells without ooming.  
---
Troll is the quickest imo
---
HUGE difference between PvP and PvE servers. It's basically a completely different game. 
---
PvE Server-happily skipping to and fro admiring the scenery greeting everyone, including the opposing faction, with a hearty wave...maybe even a cheerful greeting. Good day one and all and isnt it a beautiful day at that!
---
PvP Server-tightly holding your weapon as you cast about for enemies..because there are always enemies about. Wait, what was that?!? Did I just hear the insidious sound of a rogue stealthing?!? Is it a friend of foe?!? What's that warm liquid running down my leg?!? Is it too late to call for my mama?!? Then there's the STVietnam where you can literally be shell shocked or the always fun BlackRock Mountain waiting outside UBRS. How about the neverending bloodbath of skinners slaughtering devilsaurs and each other?
---
Nope. It’s expected and I’m embracing it
---
Please try r/wowservers for repack discussion.
---
“No sleep for you tonight, raiding through the night.”
---
Dude, this is REALLY GOOD! This is no joke professional quality type stuff
---
I'm not sure why you are receiving such negative feedback. The question itself is virtually unanswerable but that doesn't take anything away from such ponderances.
---
An equal distribution across the realms in terms of faction and server population would be ideal, I would assume, for all parties involved. In theory this is fine, in practice it's unlikely for the leaves to fall in such a perfect pattern, so to speak. 
---
Taking a sampling through polling is an intuitive way to navigate the problems that would surely arise, however engineering and developing such a poll wouldn't prove to be very useful as the sampling data would almost invariably suggest the very same random distributions of the population data, eg, the decision to choose a realm could come down to a whim of its location in the server list.
---
Though, in reality, I'm sure none of this will have a legitimate impact on the playability of the game. If they do indeed intend on shard splitting the initial zones (as it seems they've decided to do) **too many** characters will not be an issue, and **too few** seems improbable if the hype and demand is what it truly seems to be behind the advent of a classic revival. As far as a faction disproportion.. I haven't an idea what sort of harm that could possibly cause.. Or how to avoid it.
---
This was posted less than a month ago, so I'm removing this as a repost. We are in touch with the creators of VanillaFriends and they can repost it roughly monthly, but we remove most reposts in-between.

Just so you know, editing your post mid discussion with extra stuff is the text equivalent of pausing to let me speak and then interrupting me. Ends up sort of annoying because I dont want to be in this back and forth edit war. To respond to your edit, I upvoted plenty of comments in this thread and have replied to several with my thoughts, I dont just downvote spam, and I do add to the discussion.
---
As for this post, I can see you're hardcore married to this investment:return thing, and I'm not really sure why but it feels like you're going to try to mold anything into that paradigm. 
---
I dont know why you're arbitrarily attaching hardcore and casual to the front of "investment:return mechanics" now, also. What is a "hardcore investment:return mechanic"? You mentioned Sekiro earlier, because its...hard? Let's take two players, one who spends 12 hours a day on sekiro with 1 scheduled bathroom break per day and beats it in a week, the other spends 2 hours a day on sekiro after dinner and beats it in 6 weeks. Which of these players is hardcore? Which is casual? Both? Neither? The guy who played the game for a month and a half in his downtime still got all the same levels of difficulty and fulfillment, but he did it at a very slow pace. The other guy went hard and consumed it as fast as possible, only stopping for biological functions. Most would say that the guy who played on and off for a month was a casual player, and the guy who non-life it was hardcore. Under your definition, this makes no sense. Both of them put in the same amount of effort, time, and got the same fulfillment and rewards out of it. The only thing that changed was the pacing, which your definition doesn't take into account, despite it being massively important and the cornerstone of casual gameplay.
---
You also seem to think that systems like mobile shops, lootboxes, and P2W features are casual systems. They aren't. These are corporate business systems that PREDATE on casual players. Just because a mouse enters a mouse trap to get some peanut butter, doesn't mean the mousetrap is a mouse-friendly system.
---
And yes, I am describing most games. Most good games can be played with a casual mindset or a hardcore mindset and be fulfilling either way. In retail currently playing with a casual mindset isn't fun or fulfilling, unless you consider chores, homework, and grocery lists to be fulfilling. At least if you play BFA with a hardcore mindset, you can get into good content like M+ speedruns or mythic raiding.
---
Will it start phase 0, then go to phase 1?
---
Thanks!
---
Shouldn’t this be one of those select all that applies questions?
---
I like your blatant and fact-less assertion that somehow tokens would "ruin" Classic. Not that I care one way or another about them being added, it's just that you clearly have zero idea how that system even works and how it's actually a net positive for the game by ruining the potential for gold sellers to thrive and reducing the incentive for account theft by proxy.
---
....there's going to be a ton of overlapping in the statistics of this one.
---
Of course they'd keep that feature. It's going to be exactly like vanilla lol
---
Weird, because my phone didn't autocorrect "methinks" to "me thinks," as "methinks" is actually a word.
---
Although I'm not the person you initially responded to I do know what irony is, so thanks for checking in I guess?
---
I believe LookingForGroup was originally a default enabled channel early on in Vanilla, but then they made it so you had to opt-in because of all of the spam. I might be misremembering though.
---
As for trade chat, dunno.
---
I’ll falsify my own murder and live under the grid and netfragz 
---
Jk 
---
I enjoy my new job 
---
All my others have sucked and I finally found one I actually don’t wanna call in sick everyday and suck “fuck them I ain’t going”
---
i'm sorry you wrote all this because i'm honestly not bothering to read it dude. i'm really not that invested in this conversation because i'm not getting a return on it.
---
People who never played pre-wotlk just don't get it.  They don't understand how completing a day of questing in Desolace and taking the long flight back to Darn to empty you bags is a more satisfying experience than anything retail has produced in a decade.
---
In short: the simple existence of your character is more hardcore than anything in retail.  Managing inventory and reagents, buffs, being poor all the time, having terrible gear and weapons, having to run everywhere...the list goes on.  Yes BFA has more complex raid mechanics.  Everything else in the game is painfully easy.
---
Yeah, I guess I should have known "Good hunter" was code for lolz...
---
And no, I do not agree with you because Vekor was in the top .1% back then.  
---
Oh silly me for not knowing that this thread was for only for commenting about Trig. I'll notify JohnNutLips of his mistake as well.
---
ooohhhh yeah, that thing. I'd forgotten that was a thing, and I guess I could see how that would help a `kat durid iz4 fyte` score some DPS points.
---
Should be able to pick more than one, since I'm sure there's a lot of people like me who are old wow players still playing classic (in fact I still play the very first character I ever rolled, 15 years ago this year)
---
BfA has watered down unfulfilling content for casuals. Classic wow has fulfilling and worthwhile content for casuals.
---
It would not surprise me if armory for wow classic exists. Obviously the data base of characters and their equipped items will exist (that's literally how the game works) so assuming the API is open and accessible, it would stand to reason that re-creating an Armory for Classic would be pretty straightforward.
---
That's awesome, if only everyone could find a job like that.
---
WoW isnt a game that require great skill in terms of twitch movements or things like that.  It requires awareness and planning, both in terms of combat and general management of your character.  Not to say either one of those things is hard per say, but it is definitely something that retail players haven't experienced in questing.
---
Honestly I draw the line with what they have now, though I'd really rather like a wrath server too. (I didn't much enjoy TBC, but I loved vanilla and wrath)
---
..I'd also play a MoP server if I'm being totally honest, but I'd take Wrath over that if I had to choose.
---
No, because I can prepare my career, social life, and health beforehand since I know I'll be taking at least a few weeks of playing and it would damage the above lol.
---
While I agree with pretty much everything you said, I think you are assuming that taking relatively little skill means its less casual. I personally have found Wow a lot harder to get into high end raiding simply clearing mythic for example and taken a lot more dedication than it has to play other games at a high level. I used to play Overwatch fairly casually and could consistent hit GM with not too much dedication to the game. When I played Wow I found it very time consuming to Raid and farm and pvp at a decent level and was always a bit in the dark about what to do to improve. I mean with Overwatch/CS I can pretty much just play and eventually you improve/climb compared to wow PVP where I feel like you have to invest/research if you want to get better.  I will admit my experience with Wow was when I was a few years younger so my experience with it now might be drastically different.
---
Just own it, *"If you need me I'll be in Stranglethorn Vale."*
---
Tailoring is the best one to level with because you don't need a gathering profession to go along with it and bags are really useful.
---
The wait is giving me plenty of time to plan out the leveling strategies, leveling order, professions strategies, names, race, and sex for every character I plan to create immediately upon release (8). For example, while I normally enjoy taking my time while leveling, I am also aware that phase 2 will be likely be more painful for some classes rather than others so I plan to level my rogue third following two other characters. With a rogue still available to level during phase two, I can plan around having stealth available for leveling breaks away from world pvp.
---
The biggest difference for retail players will be aggro.  Pulling even 1 extra mob while questing in Vanilla can very easily mean death.  In retail you can barrel into just about any situation and either burn everything down, or worse case use one of your many escapes to just leave the area.
---
I don't think sharing your account with your wife, friends, and nephew is anything close to as damaging as 4+ months of neglecting responsibilities to put in an unhealthy 16-18 daily hours.  Most of those people should probably seek professional help.  
---
We're not getting guild banks so I'm sharing the account regardless, just as I've done in the past.  The system is poorly designed and promotes healthy lifestyles.  I'm going to accomplish my goals is a healthy fun way with my friends.
---
they could easily do progressive itemization with a classic private server. Items are just data.
---
Hi, /u/Ironandsteel
---
Did you use your phone to take that picture?
---
&gt;If you gotta rage do it outside of text chat, outside of voice chat, outside of the game.
---
So.. kick the dog, verbally abuse your children?
---
devilosaurs mafia wont be as big - mainly because of itemization option from 1.12 scholomance drops
---
5xcadaver is super strong and gives a ton of ap and hp (and 2hit and res) + truestrike shoulders + mask of unforgiven(same for hunters)
---
and for warriors u can start of with voon gloves  get ubrs last boss belt(brigam girdle) (instead of the quest belt) and just buy cloudkeeper legs than u save money for edgemasters
---
it might still sell but the amount of ppl buying will be significantly lower - so dont expect to make 22-25g per leather from that
---
rogues will run rfd pickpocket or farm brd enchant rec(not sure how pickpocket of brd will work out) which will give you 50g+/h
---
mages can also farm brd - not sure if arena will have the elite mobs - but even if it does u can pull the elites that lead up to arena and kill them in 2 pulls if u know what u are doing
---
otherwise mages locks hunters and some druids will farm maraudon for 45g+/h - they can also farm crusader enchant or couple high density spots in epl/wpl
---
for warriors its either gathering or making own groups for orbs farming in strat live (which is a very good money maker depending on rng)
---
and of course good old elemental fire/earth farming
---
Same goes for facestabbing, all you "content creators"
---
It's in every guide it seems like.
---
Nice video. Guessing you played on Shadowmoon? I did not, I was just a fellow hunter and admirer of Vekor and a collector of videos who is hoping people find their own old videos (a few already have).
---
Nope, you could choose to go Dragonscale and make Mail armor. Blacksmith mail armor stops around 40. So you wanna to LW.
---
I worded mine up. “I’m taking a month off work. I will do 1 hour a day of exercise, hang out with you for 1 hour, the rest of the time - World of Warcraft.”
---
“What about slee...”
---
“THE REST OF THE TIME.”
---
My healadin wants Atiesh. But, I'll settle for Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal as my legendary.
---
This is exactly what an undercover Blizzard employee would say to throw us off the scent. 
---
/s
---
I have a list. You should research and make your own.
---
From a guild manangement perspective, I would hope they implement this with the armory api.
---
Having autopopulating sheets with various guild member info based on rank is invaluable.
---
The guild I joined needed hunters so I'm researching it. I played a hunter in Vanilla, but only took it as far as UBRS. I got good at kiting in there, and had max level skinning.
---
I've considered going back to OSRS while I wait for classic. I've mostly been putting around on RDR2 story mode on occasion or testing out classes on a pserver to see what I'm interested in.  Like most of us though I havent touched a game in awhile, I've been reading this sub and a few ebooks because I'm so excited for classic and dint want to burn out grinding another game.
---
Word. I’m gonna roll rogue regardless and pray I don’t hate my life
---
That's what I was getting at, thank you for clarifying reddit user camefordankmemes
---
I had somebody a couple weeks ago try to tell me a Pserver isn't illegal because he paid for the original game. And that playing the game so many years later isn't theft of intellectual property, unless you are protecting big corporations and their means to squash the little guy.
---
What if your potato is a 2011 Alienware laptop?
---
Did you know that if everyone didn't account share the amount of hours that people would need to rank/do anything would drop DRASTICALLY. But because people like you actively cheat and account share you make everyone else ranking either have to cheat or play an extreme amount. Gratz on causing the fucking problem you are bitching about.
---
Secondly, you are getting really fucking confused about self-hindrance and hindrances to others. If you cheat in a single player RPG. No one gives a fuck. If you play 18 hours a day and end up dying from obesity, thats your fuck-up and mistake. If you cheat in a multiplayer game, and make it the bar for ranking 16 hours a day. You are actively hurting other peoples times and impacting them by cheating. You are gaining an advantage from cheating that puts you ahead of others.  
---
Its not rocket science, if you breaking the rules hurts other people don't fucking do it. If you don't break the rules then no one gives a shit (your example of neglecting responsibilities, thats that dudes life, its his choice he isn't breaking the rules in the game so idgaf). If you break the rules and noone gets hurt, noone gives a shit have fun ig. (People who change models to be sexier etc) If you break the rules and you actively hurt other players, you can go fuck yourself. You are scum.
---
Because the leveling experience itself was something that people enjoyed doing, it wasn't this rush to get through to get to the endgame, it didn't feel like everything you are doing is pointless.
---
Anytime, fam.
---
Im Rick James bitch
---
Sorry
---
whoosh my friend
---
It's tough to say. It would be nice to hear from someone who has played a fresh private server. Ive been looking into pumping out 6 slot bags from leathermaking early, as well as rushing enchanting/tailoring for early wands and/or 6 slot tailoring bag. Bags are an absolute must asap. That said, you wont make much cash in the long run from those bags alone, but grinding beasts to skin isnt the worst way to level if leatherworking could provide more opportunities. 
---
Its tough to plan for recipe drops so monopolies might happen by chance early. 
---
The late game stuff is interesting and id love more insight. I just wonder what happens in an economy where everyone has something to sell, but nobody has the cash to buy anything until after they build up a base of gold (by selling their own product perhaps)
---
It makes me think the economy will progress slower than people imagine. Maybe your best bet is to farm lotus/devilscale and then sit on it until things become stable. 
---
In the end, playing the AH always wins out.
---
Disagree. That much +healing and mp5 on a pre-bis blue is fucking nutty. And priests use 2.5 second heal rank 2 as their bread and butter. Whipvine is comparable to t3, possibly better it's crazy
---
Will be plenty of videos from the demo
---
Right, but that's just an issue of acclimating to your environment. A world record holding Mario speed runner might not be a very effective Stardew Valley player at first, but that doesn't mean Stardew Valley is a hard game or harder than Mario speed running. It's just a different environment you have to adapt to.
---
My message is that classic wow isn't so hard or complex that retail players will be unable to adapt to it. More likely they just won't care to adapt to it and will spend their time on something else.
---
I guess my vanilla experience was different than yours. The premade I ran with used a prot flag carrier (sometimes druid) mages and rogues were better off as support. Our win rate was pretty high from what I remember. To be fair, the prot warrior was geared to the gills with T1/T2.
---
That would explain it. Now that I think about it, 45 is probably the best possible level to run this test for Priests because that's the earliest that they can have both Shadowform and wand spec. Before that, it's painful.
---
Deaths = 10 pushups
---
No, considering I got to experience everything minus Sapphiron and KT there’s not much outside of nostalgia for me. I won’t be bothering with hardcore raiding considering I put 300 days played on one toon just in Vanilla alone a lot of that spent farming mats for pots, and gold for repairs.
---
The classic demo  during blizzcon had better textures and was prettier than screenshots I had from back in the day as well as the few times I've tried pservers. 
---
They've had to go in and manually adjust all the lighting from the live client to match the lighting from vanilla. Which they succeeded in doing but it's still better than it used to be.
---
Spriest isn't a thing until level 40, or 45 with wand spec.
---
Private servers you sign up for a site and also provide your information to this site, such as an email address, password that most people will use similar to other accounts on the internet, IP logins, etc. etc.  
---
You give the same info to Blizzard, but they are a corporation who does everything possible to protect that information since they can be in a lot of legal trouble if it was ever leaked or sold to anybody.
---
The people who run private servers can literally do whatever they want with that information.
---
This guy gets it, the best spots are the ones with no one else farming them.
---
I got a Nintendo Switch a couple months ago cus I knew that if I didn't get something exciting and fresh I would be dying of boredom in anticipation of Classic.
---
I've been happily playing Breath of the Wild, Smash Bros and FFVII but I know that when Classic hits they will go on the shelf for the time being.
---
I love how the NO CHANGES! crowed play on Legacy Servers where the ARE CHANGES!
---
You could be like my tank officer, and get so mad that you smash your fist into your desk hard enough to break it.
---
I like the design actually, it’s not meant to be flashy and it looks more real than any of the other 3
---
you people defending tokens keep saying that, and never respond to the common rebuttal: more people would be buying gold via official tokens than ever would via chinese gold farmers.  More people buying gold is bad for the game regardless of who the gold is coming from.
---
oh geez I didn't think about that :/
---
The absolute fucking truth
---
You're not wrong of course but I was looking at every solo content in the game. During leveling lock, hunter, mage, and druid are nice and smooth classes to level and can kill some elite mobs to get that sweet elite quest exp. After that at 60 druid drops off though and that's why I consider it, let's call it lower solo tier :P
---
I played on a RP-pvp server for a long time and it was always just a PvP server with seriously named characters. Saw maybe 2 instances of actual RP in all my time. Is that not normal?
---
The good ones don't include this crap. But of course Youtube is 99.9% garbage.
---
Active duty military, I got 38 days of leave as of this month!
---
Sounds like a waste to have Bruce Lee (rip) playing tank.
---
Intellectual conversation? I take it you were a big fan of EJ back in the day eh?
---
Yeah, I agree. Bring on the Chineese gold sellers spamming chat and whispers. Trying to scam and steal peoples accounts to strip them of their gold. Their bots taking up all of the good farming spots. That's how it was in Vanilla, #NoChanges.
---
Yeah it’s not easy 
---
I’ve had some horrible managers and toxic work environments
---
Yep can confirm, never got rank 11 but spent a lot of time listening the worlddefence
---
TBC. After that I am not interested. Too many changes I didn't like starting from WotLK.
---
I'm doing my part!
---
I will bet you every cent I have, every possession, every scrap of clothing on my body, my car, my entire retirement fund, and forfeit all future income I ever make in perpetuity that Jesus will not come back by any date that you name. Come on, put your money where your mouth is, you coward ;)
---
On some pservers seal of righteousness scales off SP so people will stack SP and quick weps with on hit procs that scale and just spam attack procs for dmg.
---
Everyone I've ever raided with that wasn't a Druid used 1.5s casts as their "bread and butter". Spells with longer cast times just get sniped by other healers who rely on 1.5s casts.
---
Remember when people say they give a 110% of their effort to commit to something? This is one of those situations. Just accept that somehow in some universe of the multiverse it makes sense.
---
Rough news for you, Ion is apart of the Classic dev team. "**fully integrated effort**, it has the full support of the World of Warcraft development team."
---
Guess who's in charge of that team. Ion.
---
lolferal with lolatiesh !! ;)
---
Make your alt with friend and solo your main.
---
Oh damn, the same thing happened to me! Ended up being pretty fun though; there was a raiding party of like 10-15 horde hanging around Menethil and rushing into the docks anytime a boat approached. 
---
I was way to low level to be useful for fighting them, but I was able to jump off the boat early, stealth, swim ashore, and follow them around from a distance and report on what they were doing. Eventually some 60's arrived, some from my guild and a few pickups from IF and we eventually cornered them hiding under a dock. 
---
Originally I'd just wanted to get the SW to train swords but it ended up being an hour long game of cat and mouse that was way more fun.
---
This one gets me. It was just NOT a thing in OG WoW. So many videos have been spreading falsities about being able to 'facestab' with the background they are vanilla experts.
---
The fact he won't be playing with you doesn't make you a minmaxing tryhard. There will be plenty of people that will and won't take an evasion tank rogue, but I highly doubt the minmaxing tryhards take them.  I don't know why you guys feel so attacked by this argument.
---
There are going to be so many players that don't care about min-maxing via racials. They'll just play what they want. I think it's going to be mostly fine.
---
There's a "Classic" graphics preset.
---
Are people okay? This is starting to seem like an unhealthy thing...
---
Which one's the Hunter weapon?
---
Serious question, what is vanilla and what is BfA
---
It exists for private servers, legacyplayers.com so I have to assume It will
---
It's only a problem if it negatively affect your life. There is a good chance I will be playing 30-40 hours a week for a while. But as long as it doesn't interfere with work (my only responsibility right now) I'm fine
---
No one warned me that the real channel worth worrying about was /join CrocoliskDefense
---
Grom'gol is also nice. Zeppelin to UC/Org and FP to Kargath close.
---
Gold matters more in vanilla. And gold farmers in vanilla have a larger impact on the game.
---
Better be - there's no way I can face vanilla UI
---
You're in a for a good time. I think in Legion I had some good banter between the group in around 1 in every 30-50 dungeon groups when pugging. Classic it'll be almost every group. Can happen even during questing because the grouping is incentivized.
---
I have zero interest in anything like this. I don't want to hear your voice ever. I don't want to wear a headset for a mic. Chat is perfectly fine. It worked well then and will work well now.
---
Im not sure if it against the rules but can you share what pserver you are playing?
---
The reason why Im asking is to see whether my old laptop is capable of running wow in high settings as well as to have a look at character models/animations.
---
Certainly looks like it.
---
BC all the way, I'd be more excited for that than classic personally but one step at a time. Wrath is as far as I'd go if they introduced it since that is the last expansion that still felt like it built off of old WoW. Also old school death knights. Miss the old rune system and builds like 2h frost.
---
Interesting. Do you ever play Overwatch? OW with no voice comms is a huge downer. Even if you have to listen to abuse now and then, the value of the speed-of-coordination just can't be beat by typing and target icons :)
---
I was 100% joking lol
---
I originally started levelling skinning and herbalism on my main with the aim of making money, but I got to about level 30 and realised that for whatever bizarre reason - linen shirts were selling for like 1-2g each but linen cloth was way less than 1g for a whole stack. So I quickly dropped herbalism (since it was slower to level), and picked up tailoring. 
---
Was very efficient to level those up while questing - if you had a quest involving beasts then you can skin them, if you had a quest involving just about anything other than beasts they'd probably drop cloth. 
---
Not sure if it really fit my class (Rogue), but I guess being money hungry kinda suits a rogue?
---
private servers will always be "blizzlike" at best, because it's still guesswork because of things like drop rate. They can run things to calculate drop percentage but it will always be considered a small sample size because 99% of players in the game won't be running the same software to add to those samples, and even if they did that still wouldn't give them 100% accurate drop rate chances. 
---
Private servers will never be "blizz-equal".
---
Should have come over here to Kalitta. It’s like the classic WoW of 121 jobs!
---
I'm sure some servers will have people doing this. It's not rate on pservers nowadays. Only thing is, the game's not hard enough to need voice comms
---
Playing devils advocate: many people work a full time job and want to enjoy classic as well. I seriously dont feel like spending heaps of time grinding for gold.
---
While it does work on private servers there isn't much to go on to see if it will be true in classic until we get it. I'd like to think frontstab/shred builds wont be a thing but your agruement that they are wrong is equally valid/invalid as they are right. We dont know, and won't until it is live.
---
Lok'tar Ogar to this fucking brutal shit.
---
It has been said many times already, and yet it bears saying again and again: Video games do not cause addiction. That is not an attack on anyone who feels video games were detrimental to their life - I am not trying to diminish anyones pain. This is what decades worth of psychological studies have found.  
---
The studies have been done very thoroughly, pretty much right next to the studies asking if video games cause violent behavior. They thankfully do not do that either. In order to be 'addicted' to a video game, one must already have a pre-existing underlying condition - independently of video games. This can be many things, such as a tendency towards addictive behaviors in general. It may sound like a minor distinction, but it is an important one imo.  
---
If you find your hobby as a gamer goes past your control, you should absolutely consider enlisting help from a psychologist. 'Gaming disorder' was recently added to the DSM (a diagnostic tool), and while that has lead to good and bad things, it hopefully means there will be more and better help for those who need it.
---
Did you read his post? Hes linking to a patch note saying it doesn't work
---
Same deal with reckoning, I see classic pally leveling guides still saying to respec reckoning at 34 and to make a /sit macro.
---
More than anything, to be honest. This year and a half of waiting has been killing me, and it's been getting worse as we get closer to release.
---
I'm not sure how your first sentence backs up your point more than it does mine.  You don't think gold farmers will just undercut the token price?  Fact is with tokens you have exponentially more people buying gold for IRL $$.  This trivializes gold in the game, as you said "Gold matters more in vanilla".  There is no prestige in having an epic mount if anyone can just swipe their card to get it.
---
Thats great. It being a legendary tho, i think it is fair to consider it a bit 2 mundane though.
---
You're basically me, except on top of that I've been playing vanilla servers off and on. I'm super stuck between wanting to play really badly and not wanting to burn myself out on characters that are going to be irrelevant in a couple months.
---
I mean if you got nothing else, it can do but prot war is by no mean the best FC
---
I guess the selling point of Classic is relationships vs auto-queue anonymity   
---
Dungeons take longer in Classic, let's get some banter going.
---
How do you know that we’re not already in a simulation?
---
After playing on a private server, with all its random bugs, glitches, and terrible terrible people (there are good as well), I still got hooked. Like I'm on a thread writing about it at midnight on a Sunday because I'm looking up things about the game while not playing hooked. Good luck to all.
---
I'm really looking forward to phase 1 pvp.  No honor, no ranking, no pvp trinkets or gear, just raw world pvp.
---
It's a 1 button class in pve and one the hardest to play right in pvp. Anyhow, all rotations are boring as hell in pve
---
Overwatch is a very different game. Classic isn't nearly as fast paced.
---
While that is absolutely a great idea, addiction doesn't really work that way. If you are hooked, Good luck doing those things without thinking about it or otherwise wishing you were able to play it.
---
The design is around being in a world. With that comes community and relationships. It's less theme parky and gamey (it still is those, but less). It's still in the spirit of traditional MMOs, which is what people miss.
---
No they say that it is a lot more accessible and entertaining for casuals due to the levelling being such a large portion of the game.
---
What can a casual do in retail? Level boost past meaningless dead content to do some LFR? In classic casual players can at least have the journey of levelling to 60 over a few months and have lots of social interactions with the community, and even though they take forever to hit cap people will still be doing MC etc because in classic previous raid tiers aren't invalidated as soon as the new tier comes out like in retail.
---
I know what video made you make this post and it seems you didn't really pay attention to any of the points.
---
They didn't say it was more casual than BFA, it's just very accessible to casual players because the casual content is so good and not just a means to reach the "end game".
---
Laptop AND a monitor? Back in my day your laptops came with screens
---
Same here! I'd take a Zin'Rokh too!
---
Let's get our favorites on the list and bug, I mean politely ask, the authors if they have plans to update them!
---
I'm perfectly happy playing classic in 2 1/2 year cycles. Similar to retail in that they reset every two years, I'm excited to do the new server thing every couple years.
---
Same guild. Before server change and I went to different server so I missed the mass ban for cheating in AQ40 :)
---
Oh yes.
---
I think the fact that it’s mundane plays off well with it being a legendary staff, it’s known because it’s the staff of Medivh and not because it has an outlandish design. But that’s just my opinion :)
---
Why is there not an all button?
---
I'm sure that's a great argument for the drug war as well. There already is no prestige in having an epic mount, precisely because anybody can just buy gold from a 3rd party. 
---
The market is larger now than it was in vanilla, sorry but nobody will be impressed if you have an epic mount. Sure maybe if you livestream yourself arming it you'll get some clout, but otherwise every epic mount could be bought with RL money.
---
Blizz has less resources to monitor vanilla TOS abuses than when classic was the only version of wow, so it's just going to become more like diablo 2 where nobody cares.
---
Could you put a tracker to see who's bought tokens? Sure I personally wouldn't give any fucks
---
I think some scientist said that its improbable. The computing power and machinery needed would be so advanced that they wouldn’t need to simulate a universe. There’s no point. Unless this is like Sims 50000
---
I fuckin need classic in my life like yesterday
---
Atiesh!
---
You can face stab in the demo with a lag switch and a macro that hits backstab 5000+ times a second.
---
I quit retail WoW after MoP and was always sad about it, up until the Classic announcement. But I for sure will never touch retail again. 
---
The only games that I have spent a lot of time and money on are League of Legends and time on Hearthstone. I'd be sad to leave League, but I'm really disappointed with how their team is treating their workers currently, and WoW classic will be a great reason to finally cut those ties for good. Will be sad to say goodbye to my favorite champions: Karma, Jinx, and Heimerdinger.
---
&gt;There already is no prestige in having an epic mount, precisely because anybody can just buy gold from a 3rd party.
---
Comparing with the % of people who would buy straight from blizz, this would pale in comparison.
---
&gt;The market is larger now than it was in vanilla, sorry but nobody will be impressed if you have an epic mount. Sure maybe if you livestream yourself arming it you'll get some clout, but otherwise every epic mount could be bought with RL money.
---
You just made the exact same point above.  And with that logic anyone could have just bought an account from someone and therefore your character's gear doesn't mean anything either.  I don't know why you would condone and apparently prefer a game where a vast majority of players cheat the grind by buying gold.  If they implement this system in classic a very large piece of people will declare the game DOA and walk.  I know you're the type to say "I wouldn't wanna play with them anyways" but we need as many players who will commit as we can for the game to be a success.
---
You should not be choosing class based on "Who does more thread in raids"  
---
That's just sad dude. Class is about lore, fantasy, play style, flair, power, feeling. NOT THREAT LEVELS...
---
Hi, /u/canaldonepo
---
Tbh I think the druid might be the most enjoyable class to play casually, as you can pretty much do whatever you wanna do that day lol
---
A staff only for mage, warlock, priest and druid is not for a holydin.
---
You could always create a channel and it would be global, so if one doesn't exist, players could easily create one. Typing /join "anynamehere" works fine.
---
As long as they don't force you onto fresh servers I'm okay with anything lol
---
Ill take the sword of a thousand truths
---
Not worried, I know how to live my life and do what I need now, finally.
---
How are white crit hits "proccing overpower"? I thought Overpower in vanilla was only available when your target dodges. Is there something I'm missing here?
---
I can’t imagine how cool/overwhelming WoW would have been as an 8yr old. I was playing a SEGA game called “Ball Jacks” at that age!
---
the gear you are after in raids is basically just solo gear, as the gear you need for group play is PvP gear / stam gear anyway. so basically you are taking optimal endgame PvE gear to do big damage numbers by yourself... making the whole case worse. unlike ie ele shaman, theres no NAC to boost your DPS significantly, and mail with +SP to allow you some really good functionality in PvP. a druid is basically just taking cloth gear + weapons + trinkets to make a crit video... lets be real here..
---
i also don't think it happens after nothing already matters, many of the best items are good basically until naxx. also remember, it's not like private servers where content patches have generally been pushed up, or like vanilla servers where we didnt know where gear should go.. TLDR being gear will be sorted out quicker and you're going to have a pretty good opportunity if you contribute and create a really solid and consistent guild. 
---
those slacking pure DD's are still out DPSing you with their blues... as an officer who has raided with a geared ret/feral/moonkin/spriest all try hard as hell on parses.. moonkin is particularly a giant waste of time, i should have probably specified.. feral is a different story as it has legit uses (OT, best DPS hybrid, crit buff melee) as well as spriest (after zg patch, assuming you have more than 3 warlocks). ret is also a joke, but at least 2Handers are basically PvP items anyway, so MS &gt; OS you should always get them. the problem is stuff like DFT...
---
can't argue with someone playing something for fun and performance not mattering. 
---
just stop trying to justify it and call a spade a spade. 
---
getting downvotes from people who clearly have either not raided vanilla recently and/or clearly never managed a vanilla guild. whether you like it or not, whether you accept it as truth or not, it's what is going on and it's why you are discriminated against. perhaps instead of saying hey "just play what you want cause it makes you happy", when people HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY YET.. you could give them some honest advice and not give them dreams of playing a hybrid spec they will never get the opportunity to really explore properly because they'll be forced to heal anyway LOL.  
---
honestly playing a hybrid is a bad idea. playing it without knowing the ins and outs of the game is the ABSOLUTE WORST IDEA. unless ofc you are Nostradamus and know precisely that in the future that you'll be in the worst raids, have the worst gear, be turned down left and right for dungeons, not get into any decent premades because it's an even bigger carry than in PvE.. which means the honor grind will be painful too..
---
but hey just play for fun and performance doesnt matter right. EXPECTATIONS vs REALITY
---
I'll have that mace for some sweet youtube enh shaman youtube video
---
I agree 100%. Unless I’m in a raid I don’t want to speak or hear your voice. However, since vanilla encourages social interactions I can see why people want to talk and chill in disc. More power to em
---
Once the vanilla content runs out they have no choice but to put out the tbc content and then the wotlk content and after wotlk they should be done
---
99.9995% of all "world pvp" on a pvp server is ganking.
---
If you do not get to 60 in the first wave of characters, your experience on a pvp server is going to be long periods of running back to your corpse punctuated by short periods of getting ganked by a rogue 30 levels higher than you who is corpse camping you while spamming /chicken /rude /cry etc
---
I really hope they add TBC in like 1-2 years or so.
---
Not worried, I know I will
---
Starts with barrens chat and ends with barrens chat, the circle of life.
---
If you’re aiming for r13 either you have heaps of time or you probably won’t be able to do much PvE imo!
---
Level 1-20 took me ages. It was by far my most enjoyable time playing a game. #redridgeisbrutal

---
All I want is a version of TRP, a mod that lets me make equipment sets, and bartender (I forget which one I used in vanilla but basically that lol)
---
I remember this old mod pack that was all the rage especially when you wanted to raid but for the life of me I can't remember what it was called. Had threat and DPS meters and a few other things.
---
100% playing on a low-mid pop pve server. There's enough drama/pvp irl. I want to work as a team to achieve success like humans are supposed to. Imo, not worth the hassle dealing with gankers/griefers after a hard day at work/life.
---
I think it will depend on the community. They way we interact with the game and other player is so much different then now
---
I want a custom addon developed. Anyone have any suggestions on where I could go to ask for one?
---
I very much hope they do. Without the armory API, it’ll be a lot more aids to keep track of some things for guilds.
---
Hunters can't use maces. Obviously he's a warrior.
---
Craft belts for sure, but not the other pieces. It's the twink belt of choice for the entire expac. No upgrades until at least the 30s and those are boe drops.
---
This isnt mmo-champ.
---
You can talk freely
---
I will be playing on a Normal server.
---
And when exactly does it drop off???? Nothing changes at 60 aside for the Druid getting even better than he was due to having access to gear stats that just weren't available pre-57.
---
If it's realistically solo-able, a Druid can probably it too OR do something similar a lock or hunter can't.
---
God no.  
---
  I could barely decide what class to play after 2 years and I'm still second guessing.

Great hunter weapons
---
No but only because I need to save up to buy a computer!
---
I can't blame you for mixing up zone names and even the aesthetics.  As great as Warcraft is, it likes to use a lot of similar things here and there. :P  To this day, I still have to think about which is Searing Gorge and which is Burning Steppes.  It doesn't help that in the Warcraft world, they're basically just one big area separated by Blackrock Mountain
---
I played Vanilla back in the day, but never really got my head around the lore (or I did, but it's gone now). 
---
Are there any guides/write-ups of the lore for total newbies? I'd like to engage with it a bit more this time around.
---
Thunderfury hands down.
---
*please almighty elementals*
---
Tremendous, take my +1
---
I'd like to imagine a Discord for each faction with channels for each zone world/PVP

i would love to see Lazy Pig!  Cartographer/gatherer, questie and some sort of auction house add on like AUX
---
yeah this video isn't even that bad, would get upvotes if frostadamus was uploading it.
---
Warlock thanks to Imp is probably the fastest to 5
---
You have to track that anyway. Gear doesn't make a good player. I have played with people decked out who were awful and then people who had bad gear but were great
---
If you are a caster/healing shaman, craft the Turtle Scale gear from LW (stam/int/spi). If you are an enhancement shaman, you're better off using leather and random pre 40 str pieces (stam/str/agi). At 55+, the Savage Gladiator is a nice starter set for enhancement until you can get pre raid bis. 
---
For example, this enhancement shaman will oneshot mobs in 5 mans with a decent windfury.

---
Probably, I'm indifferent either way though
---
I only ever used armoury to look at how pretty I was (I was super pretty ty for asking)
---
Is there a section on this website where I can launch an inquiry about a particular addon?  
---
I see the option to add an addon as if I knew information about it, but maybe we should create a "List of addons to be investigated" unless I missed it?
---
The best thing though is that. 2handed slow swing timer with slows though.
---
I mean yeah, you could. But that would pertain moreso to your friend group. I'm asking about the main chat channels.
---
No, he can't. The mods are tyrannical about even mentioning private servers, which btw, is a fucking retarded rule. Without private servers or the private server community, this subreddit wouldn't even exist to begin with.
---
Oh nice, you were in Bloodsworn! I uploaded another vid of you guys killing Broodlord here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGkc9mwhn3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGkc9mwhn3M) Are you in contact with any of your old guild-mates? Vekor?

That's my literally my setup. Paid about 700€ (I live in Germany).

Every game I tried so far runs on highest settings with 60+fps.
---
Certainly. I wasn’t actually talking about gear though. The docs I use for my guild track ranks for officers, raiders, etc. they also pull info on specs, and can track info on gear sure but that’s not the most useful part in classic, really I’d like the ability to pull a roster into a spreadsheet based on a rank in game. Saves a lot of time to pull it from the armory as opposed to manually updating it all the time, also less room for error.
---
Sure there’s a point - you would get to experience a different form of reality. Just like playing WoW. You learn a new set of rules that govern the game and get to experience what a world with those rules would be like.
---
The idea that the tech would be too advanced is nonesense. If you lived in Minecraft and only ever experienced a Minecraft world and the rules that govern that world , then building an advanced computer with something like redstone and the other tools available within the game would seem impossible.
---
Margin of Error, friend. 99.2 % is better than 90% and much better than 84%
---
You're making a lot of assumptions. You assume it would pale in comparison, yet the target audience of classic are kids who are now adults with jobs. They aren't going to grind out an epic mount or world drops when the gold farmer can provide it for the price of a restaurant meal.
---
Sorry, that's just how things are nowadays. I don't think Blizz can police it (again, look at D2), so might as well regulate it and decentivize 3rd party selling
---
I appreciate your reply but I was asking for the difference of release WoW and 1.12 ( which was the last patch of vanilla and the patch that this year's vanilla is gonna be played on ) I played since release and the balance changes were so drastic in the beginning that I don't really remember when what was implemented
---
Well I quit retail last year to play all the good games out there before Classic hits (mostly singleplayer games. Not gonna have time for other games for a couple months after release.
---
Yeah I feel you man. The first few months after the announcement was so intense for me that it took a real toll on my life. I watched videos and read as much as I could about the game. Once the hype died I eventually forgot about it and for almost a year I was less consumed by the wait. Then recently with all the blue posts popping on my reddit feed I'm back into the hole. Refreshing the classic page constantly, reading spreadsheet data on BiS gear for 60, and watching the same videos again.. I just wish there was a release date so I could be content with what I'm waiting for whether its coming sooner than later or later than sooner. God.
---
Nobody is gonna join your discord for a pug dungeon run, only for raids or guild runs.
---
If your looking for an interesting/complicated rotation in raiding/PvE you are looking at the wrong game lol. Most classes are going to be hitting 1-2 buttons for the bulk of a fight. The rotations aren't what makes classic fun.
---
Nope. I like the anticipation and talking about it with friends. The wait is part of it for me because I remember waiting a while for retail vanilla to come out too. Around 2003, every day when I came home from school, my friend and I went straight to www.worldofwarcraft.com and just read everything, discussing classes, what our names would be, where we would live (player housing, y'know), watched the gameplay videos rinse and repeat until release.
---
Partially. I’m torn between playing on private server now to determine if I want to switch classes or not. I was a hunter in classic and I got a hunter to 60 on a private server. I’m probably rolling hunter again but I’ve given some thought to Druid or warlock
---
it's melee, not sure if itll work on hunter pets.. having said that.. thats taking min-maxing to the most hard-corest of degrees!
---
goblin mining helmet isn't a big deal, but being able to make all the goblin stuff yourself at first saves some time and money, as some of the items require things that only goblins can craft.. which is a bit of a f\*\*\* around trying to get the materials crafts made from various people, then someone else to craft the actual items etc..
---
 if you are physical, the chicken + transporter just flat out-weighs the penalty of having to buy sapper charges.
---
alternatively as well if you have an alt or something, you can have your alt as a goblin engineer. but this is kind useless, better off having an alchemist + herb alt, and herb + engi main. because you never want to miss a black lotus, even if you can't sell it or use it until zg patch.
---
If you think it will be fun then it isnt a waste
---
The thing is that these things didnt work on private servers either afaik(sit affecting talents). But it may work cause of server lag. You dont remain seated, you spam a sit macro and the game  may not pick up that you sat, only the crit. So its rather an exploit, not a game mechanic.
---
You say that it's just me making the assumption when you are making the exact same assumption haha, you even provided a reason for why more people are going to be buying gold.  Hell we even have people like you who just want a blessing to buy gold because they're too lazy/busy for the grind.  This game is fucked if they employ the tokens man.  So many people will walk.
---
Horde and yes
---
But I'll probably be on the popular side so I'm less concerned
---
You don't have to  
---
But I would join anyone's for a dungeon run - this is a social game after all
---
Tell me about it. I'm literally thinking about it every day...I cant get into other game at the moment either, it just seems like a waste of time as ill drop them as soon as classic comes out!  Just release it with bugs, I dont care.
---
Ive seen people talking freely without reprimand.
---
They do
---
Talked to the Creator of Azeroth Auto Pilot and he's planning on updating it for classic.
---
Yeah there's a ton of stuff that is really common on pservers that I wonder about.
---
It's just a plea for the design/philosophy of vanilla to be as close to the original as possible.
---
Prob that moron tipsout
---
Wow, 7 lines of text and not a single argument. I guess _nomen est omen_ was right after all :D
---
Yea I'm fine with doing it too, just answering your question "will this be a common practice for classic"
---
And I am sure if you read the comments here, you would find that we discussed that over and over already, and your faction lost the discussion.
---
Again, I'm all for indicators that show how much gold you've been gifted. It's not my fault it doesn't pass your nochanges filter and it's not me who'd be buying gold and it's not my fault many people will be.
---
I'd just rather the person who doesnt have time on their hands to get gold easier than the one who breaks TOS and goes to a 3rd party.
---
I'm not the one who can't accept the modern realities of gaming
---
They make it seem like if you're maintank you pretty much get everything on reserve anyway. Why not just go ahead and take more items. Start by looking up bis lists for every raid for literally every other class and start formulating the bullshit reason you're going to use to ninja the item.
---
Holy shit I don't care what you think.
---
OmniCC is planned  
---
https://github.com/tullamods/OmniCC/projects/6
---
Couldn't add it to the site, submit wouldn't work.
---
Link to video?
---
They avoid it by not using the real names of the private servers, so they'll say stuff like "it rhymes with snort hale."
---
lol the downvotes dont lie.
---
True, they accurately show that there are lots of pretty dumb people around, who are, however, "educated" enough to press a button without hurting themselves too much.
---
Wife plays, and we hit that weet spot with 7 and 4.  They are in bed by 9, and we have up to 3 hours a night to play if we wanted too and longer on weekend.
---
But the entire essence of this game is to revitalize a classic experience of the game.  It's not about "accepting modern realities of gaming." The nochanges people for whom you have disdain are the only reason this game is getting made in the first place.
---
“I'm not out of touch. It's everyone else whose out of touch!”
---
To be fair, us wow fans aren't known for being all that healthy.
---
Atiesh was so good people even used it in TBC.
---
I never recorded one. 
---
Can't stream with a lag switch anyway unless you have two internet connections.
---
Why would a guild give atiesh to a druid so he/she can use it sometimes? 😁
---
I'm with you on this.
---
please no wow token
---
Enjoy the circle jerk of excitement from nerds who are living in the past
---
Incredible work, makes me even more excited for Classic!
---
Having an int heal set is important if you want to heal. Trying to heal ZF or Uldaman as a Feral/Ret with 0 intel will be a trainwreck. You can get away with it somewhat in the really newbie instances but for any lvl 35+ ones you need an int set.
---
Molten Snore, we do it in our sleep :D
---
How broke will I be leveling tailor/enchanting on my mage? Maybe tailor/herbing or mining for some income
---
just two weeks
---
waiting is killing me
---
I think YouTube is filled with videos including lore from the wc series up to the latest in bfa
---
To be honest, not really. I can't see why people are getting so antsy over it. Private servers have been around forever and they're decent. Any time I want to play Vanilla I just, well, do.
---
Getting antsy over a release just doesn't make sense. There's tons of other stuff to enjoy. I double down in this case, when you can already enjoy a pretty faithful recreation of it. It's like playing a Beta. My character won't copy over to live, but I still get that core content.
---
From a business perspective, I can imagine a hell of a lot more losses on Blizzards end if they didn't announce they're working on it favor of a surprise release. Like, the surprise release would feel really cool. But it would also mean there would be next to no good public imagine for the current version of WoW, which I don't think Blizzard wants.
---
You can revitalize the classic experience and improve it. It's fine to disagree, but it's a simplistic way of thinking with no coherent defense except abstraction and deflection.
---
If you are really concerned about the true vanilla experience, why are you still following it? They already fixed major problems with the class revamps. Can't have that can we?
---
Mage and rogue scale well with gear, but are so control heavy that they are not gear dependent.  With r10 pvp gear, if played by a pro they could continuously outplay and beat R14 players who mostly Q-dodged grinded their ranks.
---
Warrior is probably the most dependent on gear.  not to say there is no skill or tricks in the class, but the mechanics of the class are just such that better gear by an entire tier would generally be outside the range of skill alone. 
---
Warlock and hunter are somewhere in between.  More gear dependent then rogue and mage, but still have a lot of control to create room to make up disadvantages.  
---
Healers mostly use a mix of pvp and pve gear, or pve gear only.  So in that sense, no healer really ever needed rank14 to be top tier.
---
What’s with all the mentions of Mauradon when discussing the classic release schedule? Is it an important lv60 dungeon in classic? I know in retail it’s a random base level 40 or something dungeon. Pardon my ignorance, I was 9 years old when I played vanilla.
---
Hey, that's my goal this time around, too! I haven't seen anybody else trying to more or less complete every quest. Feral Druid should be pretty good for that. I'm going Disc/Holy Priest, so I'm a little worried about some quests. Are you going Horde or Alliance? Do you have a route of zones planned out? Good luck with your goals!
---
if you are a dedicated tank its pretty easy to gear up.
---
Dont take a 2nd plate class on your runs.
---
Having no competition for drops and being the most "in demand" role should help you gear up pretty fast.
---
Hail &lt;server that sounds like Cosmos&gt;
---
ITT: social inept people
---
According to my brother at Blizz, they dont know yet ;)
---
Grinding mobs with short ways to run and high fast respawn rate is always good. this is the way i will go while leveling. Combined with skinning. i have a farm mate i try to kill more rare elites this time. No profession only skinning  before 60 saves me money. I think on this way i will have 300-500 gold with 60.
---
Melee survival hunter became an actual thing when they reworked it pre-legion
---
omfg reported
---
Look here buddy, I've been waiting for a Cube World update for 6 years
---
So far they haven't really introduced anything that goes too far beyond the vanilla version of the game.  I'll begrudgingly accept the sharding issue as it will only be in early zones to deal with launch numbers.  Adding tokens will not revitalize nor improve the game.  Calling everyone who shares my opinions "simplistic" is pompous as hell dude, I bet you often think you're the smartest person in the whole room huh?
---
I find people are more chill and friendly on PVE. I´m also a healer at hearth so I won´t do any world pvp and rather help other players of each faction.
---
Ret can and should offer some offheals, but does not have a mana pool to sustain that healing.  It is just a fundamental issue of how hybrids work in vanilla.  Good Ret gear should be melee stats like str, agil, crit, etc.  Good healing gear is int, +healing, +spell power, +spell crit.  There is no way to get enough on your gear to do damage that is respectable and healing that is sustainable.  
---
Caster hybrids that already gear int are somewhat capable of fulfilling the pvp role of offhealing while doing damage.  Elemental shaman being the best example.  In Raids these specs are 
---
basically incapable the expectation would be to play as a pure healer in those situations.
---
Like I said, some people really shouldn't have a right to opinion :)
---
Yes it for lvl 40 but one of the bosses drop a ring that is needed for a lot of classes at lvl 60.
---
Go eat at their staff restaurant next door called S'Wich good sandwhiches and open to the public, eat there all the time.
---
Those messy fights are actually what I love the most. I hate the enforced X vs X sanctioned games that battlegrounds bring.
---
I hope to finally have a reason to leave fortnite behind me for good
---
Looking at it, but never realizing it till now, but diablo as a pet kinda takes me out of the world of Warcraft.
---
Avoid a streamer’s server and you should be fine.
---
I’ve been horde since classic, never getting an alliance toon past 40 probably... not sure why. I’m really tempted to give Alliance a try just to see things from a whole new perspective, but I’m not sure if that will make me miss out on some of the nostalgia
---
Being the first person a server actually able to pick Black Lotus is actually insane. Depending on how far ahead you are and how fastidiously you are at tracking respawn timers you can basically bend the top raid guild of your faction to your will. That said you have to not only be among the head of the pack to 60 but also with Herbalism.   
---
Tailoring is consistent and works great if you're playing with a guild/group willing to funnel you cloth, you can make a good amount with certain pieces for leveling and Bags Bags Bags (though if you're being funneled most of those will go to guild members) It's more low key than Herbalism since you make your money in ways tangential to just spending time farming, Mooncloth bags can keep you in consumes almost indefinitely.   
---
Alchemy is pretty big deal. There's a number of rare recipes that can give you leverage to make fat stacks and Mana pots will never not sell. But it's most of an investment to get involved in than Herb/Skin/Mine and less convenient to power than tailoring.   
---
Anything that has decent returns on Darkmoon Faire tickets will be big early on, people will want those necks or lazy bags. I personally always spend some time in 1k grinding Harpies to level so I have both Feathers for levitate and Vibrant Plumes for Faire ticket exchanges - it wont buy your epic mount but it's consistent/convenient   
---
A lot of stuff that would otherwise be rare (Thorium Brotherhood rep recipes) the more serious guilds will handle in-house which really restricts the marketability of them.
---
Not even a month. I would havr loved finding out 1 day before release
---
What are you talking about. People used CT profile for pugs in vanilla, it was very common to check talent builds and gear when signing up for raids. Agree with it or not, having a raid go smoothly is worth more in the end than ‘muh immersion’
---
Was chatting with a guildmate of mine a few days ago (on retail). I asked if he was going to play classic, and he was like "what do you mean?" I told him about Blizzard releasing classic WoW, and he honestly had no idea, he got so damned hyped! Felt good to spread the word.
---
You or anyone of the other thousands of people in the demo apparently.
---
People who speed level to 60 have access to gold. Also the token price doesn't start from zero. They set the starting price to something and if you sell a token you are guaranteed to get that amount of gold, even if no one is buying them and prices drop.
---
It's worth it if you actually go for it. You will have stronger gear all the way to 60.
---
You will sacrifice time for having it easier.
---
It’s supposed to be the highest threat per second weapon for feral tanks as well. Higher than Atiesh even.
---
Released? does the game come out with new features? If so, what type of features are usually added? Just trying to learn about the game!! Thanks so much
---
It gives the bears huge threat because they are spamming out a maul every 1.25 seconds, so yeah they like it.
---
He's right that content wise MOP was well better than Cata/WOD. Unfortunately the theme made it kind of hard to enjoy. Don't know what they were smoking. 
---
If not for the theme I would say MOP was the best expansion after Legion (not counting the GOAT classic trilogy obviously).
---
Trio &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Legion &gt;&gt;&gt; MoP = Cata &gt; BFA &gt; WoD for me
---
Tailoring and mining, sell the ore. When you reach lvl 60 you will have epic mount I'd you farm a bit while lvling and can easily farm enough gold to lvl up enchanting afterwards.
---
Alliance “pally buffs and human sword race”

Mara was added in patch 1.2 on December 18, 2004. The game's North American release was on November 23rd, 2004. While a few items in Mara are decent and some provide Nature resist for later raids, most of the discussion surrounding Maraudon centers around the fact that it wasn't in the game on release and that it came out roughly 30 days later. Some people see this as a problem, because it doesn't fit the original release cycle. Similar criticisms are made about Dire Maul, which came out in patch 1.3 on March 7, 2005. Gear in Dire Maul is very strong relative to similar dungeon gear that was previously available - especially for healers. After initially saying Dire Maul would release at the same time as the rest of the game, Blizzard announced that they were delaying the release of Dire Maul, so it would come out during their Phase 2 release cycle. This announcement was a fairly recently, so that could be why you're hearing about it more lately.
---
When talking about lvl 60 activities I'm not talking about killing normal mobs. Every class can do it at a different speed. I was thinking about killing elites in the open world and dungeons. Roots cc only work outside and that's a big factor. It's a huge defensive tool to split mobs or take a break to heal. Mage and lock can aoe farm at one point in some dungs like Maraudon in phase 1. Hunter is a staple solo grinder in Classic WoW. That class is just way ahead of everyone except for aoe dmg.
---
What does druid have? Tankiness and dual resource with rage, energy/mana. Everything else like cc and movement speed works only in the outside world. That's a big restriction.
---
Glad someone said it. I'm leveling arms as I'll be on a pvp server. 
---
Fury is kinda lame until you get hit gear and full talents.
---
Can't touch me. I played it super duper smart, see?
---
I see a lot of this subreddit jerk the false the idea that vanila world is huge. I guess it does have a certain ring to it, however it's completely untrue. Most zones in vanila hold no meaning beyond leveling proffessions after reaching level 60.
---
Besides after playing TBC you can't really take vanila seriously anymore, the classes, the pvp system, raids and dungeons are all huge improvements over vanilla.
---
Hi James! You guys seem like my kind of folks. I'm a very busy person these days but I'd still love to play WoW Classic with like-minded individuals. Thursday's raid time falls within my work schedule but I would love to join you guys for the Sunday night raid, grind to 60, instances and PvP. Other raid times on Monday or Tuesday nights would also work out wonderfully for me. I'm a very experienced lock, having raided in vanilla and TBC. We server-firsted Ragnaros back in the day and I was always top DPS. :) I was the warlock class officer and led many MC, Ony and 20-man raids (ZG and AQ). I also have experience progressing through BWL and most of AQ40, bowing out before seeing much of Naxx due to moving and focusing on my own life. I'd love to raid again and make some new friends! 
---
Feel free to PM me on reddit and we can discuss this further. 
---
Thanks!

My fear is that even if they mess it up and Pservers start popping everywhere, blizzard now has incetive to go aftet them very hard to force us into a single choice... their servers or nothing.
---
Blizzard is done as a quality PC developer. Their KING/mobile department is already making more money than the Blizzard studios. Their best devs work on mobile now and it shows. They also port their mobile business model into PC gaming like in Diablo 3 and BfA.
---
The trends started because the community became obsessed about skill. Everything had to be about skill. That's why pvp gear became easier to attain and arenas happened in TBC and pve content difficulty sky rocketed. There was this hyper focus about things needing to be about skill which also IMO became part of the downfall of WoW because it opened the doorway to needing to be perfectly balanced and gutted the RPG aspect of the game.   
---
Potions and consumables weren't skill they were seen as crutches or unfair advantages bad players needed to defeat better players. And holy shit if you lost using them and the other player didn't use them it was just an onslaught of flame.
---
You do get gear upgrades some of which at 60 are bis. But you can aslo buy them from other people. To me it never felt worth it.
---
I wish them good fortune sending C&amp;D letters to Bulgaria and similar countries.
---
I hope they use soft, absorbent paper (4-layers ideally) as printing material, to ease the singular use case of said letters :-)
---
I'd play up to wotlk, but I would want the option of either transfer char to BC servers or have to make another one. I don't want my char to automatically have to go to tbc. I want to stay at 60
---
Sounds like I'll be spending *a lot* more time in BRD this go around!
---
2005-2007: daily  
---
2007-2008: a few times a week  
---
2008-2013:  not at all  
---
2014-2016: daily (discovered pservers)  
---
2016-2018: occasionally   
---
2019: not at all (waiting for classic)
---
Kind of funny.  90% of what people say they love about wow classic is the social aspect and the first several responses are "woah woah, social but let's not go crazy and actually talk."
---
If I LFG in general chat at stormwind, will people in ironforge see it?
---
Thanks, but I clash with people often. Any time people are being a nozzle for no reason or doing absolutely anything unfair or clashing with my moral standard, I call it out. Most people don't like being called on their garbage. Examples including but not limited to favoritism or people who rather than answer a question straight forward they feel the need to write a wall of text belittling the person then providing no relevant help. I like to push these people because most of the time they dont know either but rather than be a mature person and admit they dont know or say nothing they see it as a time to be a jerk.
---
Yeah, thanks for the kind words but I'm no saint either.

And in case you aren't main spec feral? :p
---
There will for sure be Discord channels for both factions on most (if not all realms) making it easier to find groups and advertize PuG raids. However there rarely will be people actually sitting in those channels and chatting. 
---
For raids they will mostly be hosted by a smaller group from a certain guild (10-20 people) and you will be required to join their private discord. For 5-mans you will probably never use voice coms unless you get to know some people better and end up inviting them/getting invited to a private channel.

These are good enough to be sold and hung on walls.
---
You act like there is alot more to do than spam Shadow Bolt and Life tap
---
It literally will not work on blizz servers
---
This kinda blows my mind with the sub sometimes. So many threads regarding "Which class is the best to play solo", "I''m a casual player who barely got time, how can I manage SOLO"?
---
It's a god damn MMORPG. You are supposed to play with other people. It makes everything so much easier, especially if your time is fairly limited.
---
You can join a voice chat without mic or headset and just listen, about 40-60% of the raiders do that. Only the raid leaders, main tank etc need to talk.   For raiding its obligatory to be able to hear the spoken commands, nobody is going to type out everything that is being said all the time.
---
If I go alliance it will be because of the Stormwind Park.
---
That and warlock hub, it's cool.
---
darkmoon comes in a very late Phase. my first plan to farm and create rugged armor kits and sell this. but i dont want wait so long, i ditched the plan
---
No, I'm happy knowing it is coming. It is however fucking dreadfull knowing its been 2 years since announcement, **but** it is alot better than begging a wall since 2010 for vanilla with the only response being "omg this again" / "NOOO" / "you think you do but you dont".
---
 Ps that "you think you do but you dont" physically and mentally hurt.
---
I'd wait till we get an announcement and they announce the required specs because no one knows what they will be it might be higher then retail for some unknown reason or it might work on pcs that's could run the original 1.12 game
---
The TL;DR of the changes made to the LookingForGroup channel:
---
* 1.9 LFG was made global but limited to cities, like Trade
---
* 1.11 LFG was made fully global, but was made opt-in in 1.11.2 (identical to /world on pservers)
---
* 2.0.1 LFG was disabled as a means to get players to use the LFG tool introduced in TBC
---
and \[Arcanite Reaper\]
---
The only worthwhile definition of ‘casual’ in this context has to be the amount of conte t you can complete without playing ‘a lot’. 
---
Claiming QoL changes are ‘casual’ is just weird gatekeeping. You can disagree with them for sure, but it’s like saying online banking is ‘casual’ since you’re not spending an entire day paying your bills. 
---
If you play the game casually, you wouldn’t run out of content for a very long time. Your definition is whether or not it’s easy to complete, which is silly since it’s highly subjective and depends on your in game network. 
---
The main character I raided on, a rogue, I raid logged exclusively after getting my mount and decent blue gear. It ended up fully stacked in t1/2 with loads of weapons. My play time never exceeded more than maybe 6 hours per week on that character. 
---
I ended up playing much more than ‘needed’, but my main was never really touched more than two nights usually.
---
Shit, Californian here wishing I was in TX
---
these are incredible! some of my favourite zones and you captured the atmospheres perfectly 
---
you don't by chance have a Twitter or something do you? I'd love a way to follow you and see more of your work :)
---
4 horsemen vs 40 horsemen.
---
Did alchemy have any PVP thingz that were used only by maxed out alchemists? I.e. is there something awesome in alchemy that i can't buy off the AH and use without having alch as a profession?
---
...trying to understand if there's a viable PvP alternative to engineering
---
Everyone has become a fucking autist. Which is mind blowing for me. I’m a raid leader for m use to telling 40 people how to not tuck up.
---
My vote would go for Paladin but totally biased since in my opinion, pets in classic are total crap to manage.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Paladin is often viewed as "boring" but for me, they are just laidback and relaxed to level. 
---
Not very fast but not that boring either since you got the option to fulfill all 3 roles while leveling and I feel that is a pro compared to the slow leveling pace.
---
In PVP, horde will have a hard time against you since you are tanky, have alot of utility and in general, you are hard to kill.
---
Please note that this just my opinion and I do not wish to trashtalk warlocks or hunters.
---
Hot take: nothing will be like anyone expects due to fucked up intricacies of running a 10-year-old game on a modern engine, no matter how hard they try. Planning how you're going to play your class years in advance of a release has done nothing but waste your time.
---
One that doesn't really matter as a Druid is like a paladin, except not as resource dependent as their tanking doesn't require mana beyond the initial transformation, so they're completely free to heal. likewise cat form can dash anywhere to get distance to heal, and in dungeons mobs don't really reset as long as you don't evade them. You have pretty much all the tools you need to farm a lot dungeons.
---
They are a two-man party in one character.
---
A Hunter is one character, split into two.
---
They are opposites essentially.
---
have you never aoe farmed as a Druid before?? It's like a paladin doing it, except faster, and then when it comes to soloing instance bosses, they're right there with the Hunter. Hunters are better in cases where they can kite effectively, but that doesn't always apply, and there are plenty of dungeons they can't do that in.
---
Druids are extremely effective anything that doesn't debuff healing (or has mechanics so overpowered no one can solo them).
---
They aren't as reliant on NEEDING to CC, since they're that tough and self-sustaining. And judicious use of Dash and corners can let you kite to heal if you need it.
---
And this assuming you aren't doing any ridiculous Post-Vanilla meta changes. (I can't speak on those as much since I pretty much haven't touched a Druid since actual vanilla).
---
All these ideas are fine if you play 12+ hours a day, (or even more if you want to be among the very first 60s)
---
For normal people, like me, this is not feasible. However I have never had any problems making coin on fresh servers.  Just by wheeling and dealing  , keep my eye open for trade opportunities. 
---
Yes it's true that AH trade is harder at the start, because nobody has much gold  to spend, but that doesn't mean bargains are not to be found.  Not at all, there are plenty sweet deals to be made.  Because people are so short on cash, many will sell random world drops WAY below market value, because they really really really need that 70 silver or 2 gold for &lt;whatever reason&gt; right NOW!   I will happily buy it and flip it with profit.  
---
You do need a good grasp of the economy to make this work, something that is not always easy, but is learned with experience.
---
&gt;and I actually really enjoyed it,
---
Because it's a good game. I'm looking forward to Vanilla but I'm looking forward to it for nostalgia, not because it's an objectively better game. You don't have to apologise for liking a later expansion, they're objectively better in most regards.
---
If you want to get all Latin about it, what argument is there to be had? *Res ipsa loquitur*
---
The evidence is clear a day, Tokens by in large killed the gold selling industry in WoW which in turn lead to less spam, reduced incidents of account theft for the purposes of pilfering player gold, and they do not inflate the economy as some people erroneously misunderstand.
---
So I don't see what argument I need to make here, there's simple observational history to prove that they aren't a detriment to the game. The only point I was trying to make is that you thinking that their addition to Classic will somehow kill the game, or that you base your success/fail metric on their inclusion is perversely naive.
---
*" All I remember was the number of bots. One Warrior in particular in vanilla got rank 14 just botting the entire time, he was on 24/7 in Battlegrounds. It didn't really require skill to get to rank 14, it simply required a massive time investment. The worst players in the world could get rank 14 by sitting in BGs all day, which isn't really a good way for things to be done."*
---
I mean the dungeon and raid mechanics are more casual in vanilla, everything else is harder or more grindy.
---
My man :)
---
Iron Forge is under Attack!
---
Dépends. If you play resto Druid and don’t have a feral in you guild, can be very quick... or the other way around!
---
If you play priest, you gonna have a bad time for your shadow spec.
---
Warrior, if you tank, you will have issue with weapons and other fury warrior mainly.
---
Chaman might be accessible, if you play elem and what a healer set.
---
MCP users usually get a bunch of them per raid since they can't be replenished.
---
dragons of nightmare were the 4 world spawn raidbosses, they dropped decent stuff and were really, really fucking fun if they came up in prime time and you'd be fighting two other guilds for the kill.
---
I am tempted not to let the cat out of the bag on this one but the best part of playing wow on the alliance side was low que times for Pvp matches. 
---
As a 32 year old I will not have the time to play the game like I did when I was 18 and because of this I will absolutely be playing alliance because I don’t have the time to wait 15-30 mins for a battle ground.
---
Just an FYI, Classic WoW will be running the retail engine. If your laptop can run the retail version of WoW, you should be fine. The actual classic engine from 2005 ish will be largely irrelevant for performance benchmarks of 2019 classic. 
---
Granted, the models and such should be the classic variants though so, in theory, the game should perform a bit better than on retail.
---
/sit is from spell batching. the demo didnt have it. Classic should have it.
---
How private servers work:
---
Week 1: this is nice
---
Week 2: FRESH WHEN!??? DEAD SERVER!!
---
It’s... it’s not even remotely fun :/
---
Sorry buddy, next try will be better
---
You can record video without streaming.
---
Why? You realize this is going to be a 20 year old game, not some revolutionary mmo right?
---
&gt; Right and the argument is, world pvp hasnt mattered since vanilla so theyve had no reason to balance factions per server making classic more prone to them doing so.
---
The counter argument is that Blizzard **has not** put up faction restrictions during vanilla. And some servers were 80hord/20ally in Vanillat too. Why would they do it now for Classic \#nochanges
---
Can he get this on Spotify?
---
I mean, plenty have lasted for more than 5... there are server up right now which are probably 8 years and older.
---
Thank you for these comments, I chuckled
---
[It def does!](https://i.imgur.com/FCG7RkI.jpg)
---
Id have preferred if they announced it at last Blizzcon then it released this summer. If it releases in August that’s 21 months after announcement which is too long.
---
I don't believe so. General chat was zone wide only. Trade chat at some point was linked to all cities and ended up being where everyone asked for groups. I don't remember if that was a 1.12 thing or later.
---
Hmm. Wasnt there a debuff limit on mobs back in vanilla?
---
And following Naxxramas will be Gruul’s Lair, Magtheridon’s Lair, and Karazhan
---
Get em Conan!
---
The hardest things in life aren't easy.
---
Thank you!

And thank you as well.
---
I'm thinking maces, just so I can chip away at getting Sulfuras. Just a cool stretch goal I could work towards I thought. 
---
I'm assuming you need mace to make it, I couldnt find any info otherwise?
---
I draw the line when Arthas dies. I have a personal goal of seeing all the endgame content in Vanilla, TBC and wrath in it's entirety, so I hope I get to do that. 
---
I also feel like Classic is the perfect occation to create another storyline than the one we got. I am biased about seeing TBC and Wrath again,  but it might be a slippery slope to just recreate all the expansions (which could be an argument against doing any of them).
---
So why no make a whole new first expansion instead of TBC, explore new lands with our post Naxx characters and also try and expand upon the game mechanics in another route than we already tried once. Both the lore and the gameplay derailed too far, so maybe Classic is a chance to reset it all and have 15 new years of expansions, having learned from previous mistakes:)
---
&gt;The evidence is clear as day, Tokens by in large killed the gold selling industry in WoW
---
And what evidence exactly would that be?
---
Do you have numbers to support that claim? Can you tell me how many gold sellers there were active before, and 1m, 2m, 6m after Tokens were introduced?
---
How do you measure the effectiveness of something, when you cannot even measure it? If you know the answer to that one, and the answer turns out to be correct, congratulations, you're in for the next Nobel Prize.
---
&gt;there's simple observational history 
---
Good one. Really good. And I am sure a person of middling intellect would be intimidated by such meaningless word-constructs. Alas, I am not one such, and so I can confidently tell you what "observational history", stripped down to it's essence actually means: OPINION.
---
You have no evidence, you have your opinion on the matter. And that's fine, until you start trying ti make it look like it's any more than that.
---
Okay can someone tell me, did the 0% chance to dodge if you’re being hit from behind not exist back then either? I see so many rogue pvp vids of them opening and going in front  of the enemy and attacking them while getting parried or dodged lol. I thought it was common sense to attack from behind when you stun someone so they can’t dodge or parry. Or was this not added yet and I’m an idiot?
---
I know I'll be addicted, but as an adult now I have much better time management and impulse control.
---

Umm... Kinda confused about the downvoting. I guess Reddit? 🤣
---
&gt;Planning how you're going to play your class years in advance of a release
---
People that did that will have to make a few adjustments to their gameplay while you and I will have to relearn everything.
---
Negative, Engineering is virtually mandatory in Classic and you'll especially want to have it for PVP.
---
Honestly I feel the same way. The waiting is a pain for sure
---
As long as the 1.12 trees remain the same, how i play my paladin won't be different. 20 points in holy, 31 points in prot. Healing all the way to 60 in groups, pulling all of the mobs and aoeing them down while questing.
---
So, gentlemen, if your group is looking for some healing magic and that sweet, sweet sanctuary blessing. I'm your man.
---
Leveled alliance in classic on a PvP server where horde had a way higher pop. Did this happen? Sure, but not enough for anyone to be so scared they can’t play Pvp servers.
---
World Pvp in vanilla was fun and worth it. Leveling characters in contested zones and running into players of the opposite faction that were your level or close was fun. Some times you win, some times you lose. Some times a level 60 char kills you because he can. You get to level 60 then you return the favor to opposite faction.
---
Thunderfury as always! The memes!
---
144hz for an MMO is overkill, I would recommend 21:9. Streaming with 21:9 is amazing except not all content is compatible so sometimes you get borders but it can be easily ignored because it just shapes it into a more standard monitor
---
How did fighting other guilds for it work? Was it just the group that did the most damage?
---
What are you talking about?  It's THE revolutionary MMO.
---
The raid to tag got the kill, so it would be a race to kill it before your tag pull group got wiped, or you’d just try and wreck the raid who had the tag. Great times
---
Not true about the weapon skill, you're dense !
---
And the weapons skill make a major difference in DPS, something like 10%.
---
I'm one of the people obsession over my class and in a variety of different discords and did levelling dry runs on private, but my point that people trying to min-max and having shitfits over which trivial thing was or was not in 1.12 are just pissing in the wind.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!
---
The last time I played WoW was early Legion. When I heard that Classic is coming out, I bought BfA to "waste time" until release. I'm still leveling to 120 and taking my sweet time. It's not terrible and it's been scratching the itch tbh. That's all I care about rn.
---
In pure gameplay/number terms, no, it's definitely not worth it unless you can get the Devilsaur Patterns and Leather, and even then it's hard to argue it'd be worth it for just those two items.
---
However, in terms of *fun*, it's worth it to me.  Basically all of Classic is about tiny, incremental progress of questionable gain anyway, so might as well do it.  For that matter, it's always funny to me when people give the same reason for why they don't like BfA or Legion.
---
I want ashbringer, even though i would never use it. As a paladin who intends to heal raids and pvp, and who's going to tank some 5s, ashbringer would just be a flavor itwm i would blow all of my dkp on just to have. I imagine a lot of people in my guild would be pretty salty about it, but that's the dream.
---
As I intend to play warrior tank, it seems obvious to wish for TF
---
But just wondering, as I have very limited warrior experience (never went above lvl53 back then), is Ragna mace any good for pvp?
---
I mean compared to AV mace for example? Or other 2H from raid until BWL included?
---
All these grown men cry about getting ganked and corpse camped are pathetic. PVP server or you might as well be playing Hello Kitty Island adventure.
---
After the divorce in december, this is really all i have left. Sad as I'm sure that sounds i honestly can't wait to have this community back.
---
Why does any of this matter? Ion said he doesn't want to fuck it up and he's already told us what he wants to do. Sharding is the only thing we don't have a definitive answer on.
---
Incredible, thanks for pointing this out
---
I have seen this guy with a pack of smokes rolled up in his shirt by his arm. Fucking badass guys. This is his art guys. Rofl
---
I'm kinda addicted already, and the game isn't out yet..
---
At least one level 60 and one level 35.
---
I'm pretty sure that players aren't supposed to be able to dodge and parry while stunned.
---
It's the "take your time crowd" and #nochanges crowd that don't realize these things were existing in Vanilla.
---
Classic for me, if they force me into a game that is outside of 1.12, im out for good.
---

I wonder what it would be like if everyone pressed the "suggest a realm" button and stuck with it. Wouldn't help necessarily since it wouldn't know what favtion you were going to play before you it suggested a realm. But that would hypothetically mean it there would still be am even split like flipping a coin thousands of times.
---
"Select all images with street signs".
---
There is leveling, pvp, pve, gold farming.
---
Being able to buy gold means killing 25% of wow's progression and content.
---
Ita just a terrible idea. If there are tokens I'll buy alot but quit the game soom after. Its just bad for the game.
---
yeah revolutionary.. in 2004..
---
Figured it might be some fundamentalist bullshit like that.
---
Personally, I'm looking forward to a lot of the things that made vanilla more 'difficult', but having to look up what the next quest I should do isn't one of them.
---
Also, AAP is for alts. I'm sure there's some people that use it on their first go round, but there are some people that read spoilers too.
---
Askmrrobot shouldn't be in classic. God i hate the whole simming shit.
---
Blizzard is obviously a 40 man raid. He needs to go there with a group.
---
Hot take: some people like to theorycraft in advance because they find it fun and they don’t consider it a waste of time regardless.
---
Exactly.  Because it's a good game.
---
5. Enchanter back char.
---
PCs can't dodge/parry from behind, though NPCs can.  However, it's because of natural server latency that even Backstab can technically be dodged/parried.  Stuns make it impossible to dodge/parry no matter what, though I suppose if multiple attacks happened at the exact same time as the stun, latency, again, would allow them to be dodged/parried.  Kidney Shot definitely can be dodged/parried.
---
In general, people just weren't as good at the game because it was newer, so yeah, you'll see stuff like that.  Or perhaps a better way to word it is that there were less people that were skilled back then, let alone also uploading videos.
---
Completely the opposite in France, Alliance was much bigger pop, except the biggest PVP server.
---
AFAIK Blizzard introduced blood elves in TBC to make the Horde attractive to more player.
---
I'm fine and down with that. But if it causes you to tilt all the way into a PSA thread, go back to some chill classic music for a bit first! ;)
---
Everyone should be worried since the question about transfer CD is barely asked. Hope it's paranoia though.
---
It wasn't fine in Vanilla, Alliance was much bigger than Horde except a few outlier servers.
---
Not everywhere in CA is fucking San Fransisco.
---
NPC's can not parry from behind on actual WoW retail/classic/vanilla. Only dodge from behind.
---
Hard CC'd players have no avoidance
---
Alchemy, like Tailoring's Mooncloth and Leatherworking's Salt Shaker, has a cooldown to create Arcanite Bars. They're not used in combat, but they make consistent gold. Everything else from Alchemy can be used by non-Alchemists. What class are you going? That can affect preferred professions.
---
I need my EnergyWatcher and StunWatcher please
---
All those private server people will also wonder, how much harder the raids and even 5 people instances will be 
---
all private servers are from a Backup in burning crusade times, with still Lots of errors
---
They got so much wrong
---
You're about as annoying as a hunter's pet, that's something :D
---
Maybe he should. I think he is fighting misinformation, which is a noble cause in my opinion.
---
GDKP is usually Gold Dragon Kill Points
---
Yeah, I realized my mistake and also how awkward the wording was.  I tried to fix that fast among other things, oops, lol.
---
I absolutely love your style of painting landscapes. They’re super appealing.
---
No one except Blizzard has the hard numbers, and probably even they don't have the whole picture. To expect anyone to have that is pretty disingenuous. How many gold selling spam messages have you seen in chat or gold selling spam whispers have you gotten in the past few years? Bodies dead on the ground spelling out gold selling websites? Level 55 DKs whispering you named "Blizerdcs"? Is it markedly lower than it was prior to the inception of WoW tokens? Is it the same? Worse?
---
It's anecdotal but that's all we as players have to go off of. Do you have the numbers to show that such isn't the case? I highly doubt you do.
---
No, because then people would use it to exploit. There’s a reason why it’s never been allowed before.
---
So again, no.
---
In my Vanilla experience most of the time I was getting more money by selling the components at the AH instead of the whole crafted item.
---
Regardless, the hot take wasn't to theorycraft, it was to not expect the game to be anything like what you could predict with theorycraft. ;)
---
You don’t need discord for dungeons but for raids it’s always used.
---
&gt; My budget is most likely going to be about 400- 600.
---
If you are okay with limiting yourself to 1080p60, then this should be okay.
---
/u/Green_TeaRoll is partly right. Classic will use the same engine as BfA. But the landscape and enemies present in classic have reduced fidelity. Also player characters and player gear isn't as detailed in Classic as it is in the later expansions.
---
This means Classic will run better in most situations than BfA. A few things you **absolutely must** have:
---
* Quad Core CPU. The new WoW Client supports more than 1 core and does well with 4 cores. Having only 2 cores might save you 20$ or so, but overall you are better of with anything Quad than Dual.
---
* 8GB RAM. Shoudln't even be a debate.
---
* SSD. This will hurt your budget, but the difference is more than worth it.
---
Graphics card isn't that big of a deal if you don't plan on streaming. Anything from AMD (cheaper) for what you can afford should do.
---
Lol all good, I was like this guy is basically right. Hopefully I don't look like too much of a dick correcting him. But the post is based on correct information so its better to clarify i feel.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I only voice chat with the guild I'm in. not joining some rando's discord. text works just fine.
---
It's an amazing levelling talent. Not good for group content.
---
Agreed with your first sentence, not the second one ;-)
---
They're not stupid, they're more greedy than an original Nelf huntard noob in his first Deadmines run :o
---
By this, do you mean people that are tired by the daily (or should i say "hourly") "Blizz please implement Retail into vanilla, i promise my opinion is not going to hurt the game, and i totally can't grasp the idea of other people also having opinions." thread?
---
Corrupted ashbringer EASILY. Coolest weapon model in the history of wow. Thank you for including it with the legendaries Btw.
---
It was a good time. What was a less good time, was my first toon, a warrior I abandoned at 30. My brothers, who played mage and hunter, said, "oh go play Warrior, thats the easiest class"... mistakes were made.
---
These would be made by blizzard, from the legion/WoD models/textures files. In the context of the legion client which is being used now. Not sure that would allow cheaters
---
Just play for fun man. Any time you spend having fun isn't really wasted time.
---
Fair.
---
&gt; I'm not the fastest leveler
---
&gt; might take me 4-5 days played until i hit 60.
---
You realise the world record in a 'legit' way is like 4days 20 hours or something, right? XD.
---
4-5 days /played is godlike :p
---
I'm a teacher so I can't book time off. I'm very much dreading a release date that doesn't let me LAN with my mates as planned
---
That wont stop a hunter from claiming it as a hunter weapon.
---
Probably a dwarf :o
---
so if I'm playing Classic and see someone /sit during a fight I know they are pirate server criminal scum? good to know
---
I still have my nost characters. I really don't see why people are so afraid. There's been so few servers that actually shut down perma.
---
Do you make that much money by selling Nightfall ?
---
I would think it's a guild effort so most of them are crafted inside the guilds.
---
I already answered that ther answer the prenerf cthun was the unkillable positioned tentacles. It had nothing to do with DPS however and unless if you can prove it with that socalled "mathmatically impossible" bullcrap, then I'm gonna continue to say that it wasn't.
---
Atiesh takes the most time easily. Just getting into naxx and having proper consumes for your progression runs sucks ass compared to farming MC every week then pooling together mats/gold from the guild for TF. You could argue Sulfuras because you are on your own since the guild doesn’t benefit from it and it’s mostly just for PVP. Corrupted Ashbringer is like a 17% drop chance but it’s off the 1st or second hardest boss in vanilla and is for warriors, pallys, and hunters only. Since I’m never going to see Naxx I’m gonna roll a shaman since I’ll never have a shot at it hehe
---
Can you imagine if that was a thing today, "requires 2.2k* rating to talk in this channel", the amount of QQ from people would be insane.
---
*random example number.
---
&gt; it's a 1.12 body on a ~~7.3.5~~ 8.2 chassis
---
They will be on-par with the engine from now on. So you can expect ally things 8.0-8.2 introduced (DX12 and better multi-threading) to be in Classic as well.
---
My vacation is already set so now it depends on when the game will release
---
I have a bad habit anyway of posting and then checking more and doing little tweaks afterward.  I always have to make sure to keep things concise or I type way too much, so that's all it is.
---
Hand of rag has to be harder than TF. Yes the drop chance isn’t as bad because it’s only one drop, but you have no help from the guild to make the hammer like you do for TF. You are completely on your own to craft Sulfuron Hammet but the guild will cough up mats and hold to help build tf since the guild benefits from it so much. It’s basically just a waiting game for TF and not necessarily “hard”. Atiesh is def the hardest
---
Best we have is articles by journalists who spoke with the farmers/sellers themselves and the ways those individuals have lamented the "collapse" of their industry. Such as in this [article](https://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2228-im-paid-to-play-mmorpgs-its-nightmare-5-realities.html)
---
&gt;As we can see, the first 7 points of Weapon Skill increase the glancing blow damage by 20%!
---
From [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7f9al/cancers\_compendium\_of\_dragonslaying\_an\_indepth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7f9al/cancers_compendium_of_dragonslaying_an_indepth/)
---
I’ve taken the time to learn to dual box on a wrath server, let me tell you.... wrath is the epitome of wow , still holds classic values true with all the modern tools of current WoW and great story too.
---
I give this a "MEH" its endgame, upgrades don't exist for all intents and purposes.
---
How intense of a rotation do you want? Feral Druid DPS is pretty tryhard and requires lots of powershifting and timing stuff to put out decent DPS if you're into that kind of thing
---
none
---
No.
---
Being based on the 7.3 engine it will have the new models most likely
---
The stupidity of having people rolling on items for the upgrade later down the line was NOT a part of vanilla wow, stop trying to change things.
---
Smart post.
---
As prot you can run AV and tank the bosses, easiest PvP is when you go full PVE lol
---
I would add (as I wrote in another thread) that token and shop makes sense in any case.
---
You can buy a token directly from the character screen if your sub has expired, it makes sense to be able to do the same from the classic client for those who don't have retail installed but have gold on their accounts.
---
Also you can sub and/or buy game time from the shop, again it makes sense to allow the same from the classic client.
---
Pretty sure we do. The new graphics options are in when the beta got uploaded to the CDN iirc? And there was a "classic" option so you can have the choice because it makes zero difference what you see on your screen as long as it doesn't change anyone else's.
---
Hunters are bottom of the range DPS after BWL though.
---
Its a pretty meme weapon, by the time you have the litteral 10,000g in arcanite bars, its good, even better on horde with WF but by no means is worth the investment
---
My main back in the day was a Warlock with Hunter as second. Had so much fun playing both. Keep in mind though that Warlock is a bit more demanding since you are more focused on doing damage over time. PvP i found was particularly challenging as a Lock. Fear... DOT... kite
---
Ya, and that's really the only class I'd even want it on... Which was kind of the point of my comment.
---
Meme
---
Don’t doubt it’s somehow possible but that’s a pretty extensive exploit. My point was more around playing the game conventionally rather than relying on exploiting the game netcode and using macros.
---
Have you tried contacting Blizz to see if they can/will manually do it anyway?
---
Honestly there’s no way this isn’t happening.
---
A lot of people will tell you to go Orc because of the 25% stun resist, which will definitely cause you to experience "blowout" moments where you resist every stun from a rogue and beat them without contention; but, I would highly recommend Troll as a Horde Hunter: they are far better for leveling (5% damage to beasts, attack speed cooldown, and bow skill), they have the highest base Agility of any Horde race, and I think it's pretty hard to beat Male Troll animations (although I myself go female troll). Hope this helps.
---
I leveled my main in vanilla as tailor and enchanter while leveling, and it was a pain. I was always broke, I had to grind a lot at 40 for my mount, the professions were pretty much always too low to provide much help (other than bags). I'm pretty sure I never got back the investment I made in enchanting. So it didn't feel worth it, no. But I am seriously considering doing the same again in Classic, so... *shrug*.
---
You don’t level DW fury
---
Its pretty memey man, im sorry, granted PROT paladin is my favourite 5 man dungon tank, 
---
"Oh we got a pally tank for scholo/strat? We on ez street bois!"
---
I should have added "hamstring" and a comma, my bad. Crits in themselves don't proc OP, but because you're dual wielding and attacking as fast as possible (this gets ridiculous with 5 stacks of Flurry!), there is an increased chance for the enemy to dodge because you're throwing more attacks at it. You spam Hamstring because it costs the least amount of rage from all attack abilities, and it does not take away from your weapon swing timer. That means that if both your daggers are 1.30 attack speed, you will do 3 full hits (2 whites and 1 yellow from Hamstring) every 1.3 seconds. Hamstring can also crit very often which can proc other self-buffs.
---
So essentially you let your white crit hits do the majority of the damage while spamming Hamstring for an additional attack+snare while waiting for the enemy to dodge so you can use Overpower for added damage.
---
I've gone by this formula for many years and a lot of levels. It's super fun and rewarding, although it is more on the glass-cannon side of builds. And if you happen to be rich and find good fast attack one handers (has to be less than 1.50 speed), you can pop fiery weapon on both and just watch the burst happen all day long.
---
So the videos not really showing truth or they are video creaters that wanted to  play ret so much they are making those videos and making it look like it can playable :D
---
Ret Paladin is the ultimate meme. Even for the Horde. ;)
---
Basically anything else, except Moonkin maybe, is more feasible to play. Good luck.
---
Then you had sleepy mages :s Yes, Mages had DPS issues. But all raids in TBC could be done with pretty much any setup. If you had problem with a boss or two, they'd die 2 weeks later after your guild geared up a bit.
---
&gt; SSD. This will hurt your budget, but the difference is more than worth it. 
---
Current SSD Prices are really good. 1TB is only 120€ atm.
---
Would buy a 250GB SSD for system only (or 500GB for extra premium + you can actually save some games on your SSD) and a 2TB HDD just for games.
---
Will post a full component list later, have to look up some parts.
---
It does matter as you can only guild with those from your server and if you roll a faction on a server that's dead for that faction then you may not be able to join a guild, or at least a good one.
---
Arms is super smexy.  If you play it right, you can even dual wield Arms.  With extra dodges, you can make overpower procs happen pretty regularly.
---
(2h would probably still be better, but dual seems to be a fun alternative.)
---
Cheap Shot can't be dodged or parried (it can miss if not hit capped but that's it). Players also can't dodge or parry when crowd controlled or when attacked from behind. As far as I know all of that has been true since release.
---
Which retail server just released Naxx?
---
Yeah. I've played continuously from Vanilla and still do play live today, on top of testing stuff on PS' to prepare for Classic. I need multiple votes please.
---
I hope so, I tried the old version on a pserver, it’s not horrible but it’s certainly better to stare at better graphics/lighting/models
---
i just see a massive influx of bad, unfunny memes and stupid posts like "which race/class should i play".
---
I had my backstabs getting parried in actual Vanilla. Facestabbing existed in PvP for sure.
---
All nightfalls are crafted in guilds basically.
---
How would it be exploited?
---
I don't care if we get them or not but I'm intrigued.
---
The confusion doesnt surprise me in the least. I played in vanilla and I've played on ALOT of private servers ever since and the memory does get blurry. I cant for the life of me remember if this was a thing in vanilla, but judging by the above linked patchnotes I guess it wasnt.
---
I'd play WotLK just to experience the raids as I quit when wrath released but regret it after hearing about how awesome Ulduar was and I really wanna fight the lich king.
---
I could roll on a pserver and may one day but I'm happy with having Classic so far.
---
Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
I wouldn't say tbc just simply added to vanilla. It did take plenty away as well. It stuck all the high levels into outland and added flying so the world didn't feel as alive.
---
I'm in a semi-competitive/semi-casual guild on retail
---
I was guild master for awhile, but stepped down about a month ago now I think.
---
Part of this reasoning was because I plan on spending most of my wow time in classic.
---
I'll probably dip into retail when i have time to join for more guild stuff but honestly, since i stepped down i almost havent been on wow at all since I'm waiting for classic.
---
When I explained this reason aside from my other reasons why I'm stepping down as GM, I talked about my plans and how I was trying to do this sooner rather than last minute when classic is released.
---
There was some backlash because of other things to do with me stepping down, but I can't dedicate my time to a raiding guild right now.
---
More strain the system than it is to just stream to youtube and download the stream to chop up later. But then again I haven't upgraded since Starcraft 2 came out, CPU wise.
---
I have been keen for the past few weeks now and its killing me! I can only watch so many videos about classic etc before there are none left!
---
&gt; How broke will I be leveling tailor/enchanting on my mage?
---
Very. And you will almost certainly not be able to quite keep up with the enchanting skill. That's not to say it's a terrible idea, though.
---
pretty much every modern vanilla private server is *functional* enough to have fun on. they're all pretty far from perfect, but if you just wanted to waste a month or two they're all playable.
---
No, but 2h fury is very viable.
---
Thunderfury because I'm a warrior and its the most *useful* item.
---
- Sulfuras is cool but pretty bad in PvE and only useful in PvP up to T2 content.
---
- Ashbringer is just a /flex item. There are better 2handers for PvE and PvP.
---
- Atiesh. I'm a warrior so idgaf.
---
I levelled my first warrior with blacksmithing.
---
It was mostly useless, the items you can craft are usually 10 lvl under your current lvl.
---
I think Blizzard wanted you to craft for lower lvl and buy from higher lvl.
---
However most of the items you can craft are not better than random drops and are much more time consumming to make, so not worth it imo.
---
+5 weapon skill does not increase your dps by 10% you clueless moron. It’s been calculated many times and it amounts to 1-2% total dps increase.
---
How about Eye of the storm in the elemental tree?
---
So technically, Atiesh is still bis on at least 1 mage.
---
It will 100% be a thing. And even if blizzard decided against it, there will be unofficial sites to keep track of your gear, just like in retail vanilla such as CT_profiles or current private servers with legacylogs.com
---
Yeah but not *your* mage 
---
/cry
---
Source for this information? I only know only about my own server in vanilla which was pretty equal.
---
There were CT_profiles and allhakazam in vanilla where people would add their character profiles with gear and talent specs. I also believe maxdps.com was up and running at that time.
---
So what? Look at vanilla raid videos and pserver ones: Notice how the pserver raids are ten times more organized, use twice the buffs. Plenty of users here said they went to naxx while being clickers. Flasking and using other consumables is a given nowadays. I'm in a pretty chill guild and we have a 20-30 items long list of consumables we have to bring for raids, each raid having different set of items.
---
Back in vanilla people laughed at a guild that decided to just flask up and kill a boss that way.
---
I think they mean it was more casual *friendly* than BFA because it wasn't set on the raid-or-die mentality that prevails on retail, nor the everything time-gated.
---
In vanilla end game was the whole game, not just raiding, and you could do everything *at your own pace*, not being forced to do daily chores every day or you're left behind.
---
It was also more alt-friendly without all the artifact/azurite grinding and the hell of RNG that is warforge/titanforge.
---
Are you ded yet ? oO
---
I have a huge backlog of games on Steam and a huge backlog of TV-shows I still havnt watched. Classic will not help in this regard.
---
Don't we all.
---
I think you misinterpreted how vanilla worked: You just don't get any proc out of /sit, server lags have nothing to do with it.
---
This is simply not true, considering there are varying branch's of the the core's available.  You cannot possibly know which realms are correct and which are not unless you have access to the data of every private realm core available, as well as blizzards.
---
Pretty much this, you will have to make do with what you can get elsewhere, crafting, dungeons, maybe use some of your tank pieces if you have nothing else. But remember the blue pvp set is actually really good considering what patch it will be. You can make do with what you can until you get this set and then use that to push for R13/14 whichever you go for.
---
What?
---
Lookup curse or nihilum world first videos
---
They used every buff available, even we used the buffs from the flowers in felwood I think it was
---
But you won’t see buffs like the one from the Onyxia head - because even this mechanic is bugged on private servers
---
In vanilla the buff had a global cooldown plus did not last when you die, so one pull a day with it, and most times some other guild used it already
---
Freezing cold take.
---
I seriously doubt that streaming uses less resources than regular recording. The only difference is sending bytes to your HDD and sending bytes to your NIC
---
You can play Retri but gearing up is a horrible experience. You have to compete with Fury Warris for most gear, which does most DPS in the later stages. So raid leaders will gear them up first. You also need a guild that is willing to bring you along. 
---
Imho Healing is so fun and challenging in Classic, you don't want to do something else. They'll freaking love you in BGs and Raids if you know what to do. Retri is a meme until WotLK and not fun to play due to the lack of mobility and reactive abilities
---
I want to name my guild "Forgive me for I have simmed". But I think thats to long.
---
&gt; The reality of the matter is your "choice" of legendary weapon, save for if you roll a warrior, is given to you when you roll your class.
---
I think that's the point of the post.
---
Choose your class based on what legendary you want most.
---
Warlock checks Pet and Shadow
---
Hunter checks Pet
---
Paladin checks Holy
---
PRIEST checks Shadow and Holy
---
So... Priest or Warlock then? ;)
---
But how do you know if something is a upgrade?
---
I've only found out about it within the last 2 months or so. I'm excited, but even with all that time I've barely narrowed down what I'm going to main.
---
It sort of is, opportunity cost-wise. You could be doing something productive before the productivity-slayer is released.
---
Rogue? They just keep SnD up and spam Sinister Strike with the occasional Eviscerate to dump.
---
Retail has way more casual content, but in Vanilla casual content was actually meaningful. So its up to definition what game you consider more casual (friendly).
---
I wasn't planning on playing classic.
---
I should stop reading this.
---
Wow is bad for my social life.
---
Wow is...
---
Wow..
---
Omg what class am I gonna play?!?!
---
If you limit yourself to WoW:Classic Win10 and WoW should fit on a 250GB SSD. For Classic it might not be that important though. Much less teleports and loading screens so you really only save on login.
---
I'm in the same boat here. I started playing in August 2005 (EU), and for half a year I would come home, check the WoW website, read articles and the forums. I was very young at the time, and my parents wouldn't let me play a subscription-based game at first. Bugging them on a daily basis and even bringing my dad to eventually play with me certainly helped!
---
No, not at all.
---
I had elemental leatherworking on my rogue.
---
I don't know why.
---
I always preferred to level with 2 gathering professions, bank and auction off what you can and deal with it at 60. You shouldn't need to craft anything for levelling, you will soon replace most things and its a big time saver to do it separately and not whilst levelling.
---
Yeah recording wouldnt be affected by cpu. It would be pretty much only your HDD write speed
---
As someone that's played on private vanilla servers on and off since 2008, from experience I think the report autoban would be an insanely huge problem. I can guarantee you that on every world boss, the main tanks and raid leaders of every guild attempting would be banned because people don't want competition. 
---
Flag carriers in premade vs premade games would get banned mid game. All it takes is literally one guy getting his entire team to report the enemy flag carrier, and the flag will get returned. I'd like to think that people are nice in general and that this won't happen, but having experienced the playerbase of vanilla for more years than most, I sadly think it would be a huge issue unless they do some serious tweaks to the system.
---
Let's say you have 2 premades on the same faction fighting for top 10 standings. If those 10 guys in the one premade all report the number one standing in the other premade and he gets a 12 hour ban, he's not gonna be able to catch up on honor. In return, the other premade will definitely retaliate, and then the shit hits the fan.
---
Yes, and a nice guy too
---
Yes but then the “missing hit for fury” argument falls flat because it’s the same for arms
---
Do you honestly think a feral druid would waste MCPs on low tier raids? I get he would use 1-2 charges per boss in Naxx and AQ40, but in BWL? ZG?
---
I'm going to give up my apartment and move back into my parents' basement for authenticity.
---
Even if blizzard would sell gold, goldsellers would sell gold for a cheaper price.
---
Word. The announcement of Classic triggered something odd in me; a certain drive to get as many goals as possible done by the time of its release.
---
I finished my bachelor's degree, moved out, made a lot of progress in the gym, got part-time jobs that'll allow me enough free time to play the game until I'll start my master's degree. The only things left on my checklist is getting my driver's license (which I should have pretty soon) and getting an english certificate in order to study abroad.
---
In a way, Classic made my life much more productive. So even if for some reason (I pray that won't be the case) I won't enjoy it for what it is, it has already improved the quality of my life a lot!
---
I'm glad the final season of GOT is airing right now, otherwise I'd have little else to look forward to as a single AF workaholic. 
---
(Really though, I need to book my holiday asap so I need that release date on classic rn)
---
I provided a source, what's yours ?
---
You are correct that 33SP &gt; 2% crit. However, the [33SP](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22630/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian) is from the [warlock version](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22630/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian) of the staff and the [2% crit](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22589/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian) is from the [mage version](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22589/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian).
---
A couple of distributors knocked it back because of the samples in the songs. They aren't copyrighted so he might have to just bend the rules and say he owns them.
---
I'll be leveling one character on my own and one character with a friend, so which one is first will depend on how much we play together.
---
You linked the Mage version for warlocks. [Warlocks](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22630/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian)have the 33sp equipment bonus
---
RP-PvP!
---
Because RP is so much fun, nerdy and you laugh a hell a lot. And PvP because it's fun with some world PvP-ing and as an Undead I would not let a Paladin live. Regular RP-normal realms make no sense to me what so ever.
---
Blizzard, please. RP-PvP =/
---
My memory and the fact that Blizzard introduced the blood elves in the horde to make Horde more attractive.
---
Fwiw I had to reroll horde since the imbalance on my server was something like 80 Alliance for 20 Horde.
---
Well feral tank caps pretty early. 
---
What I mean? You get bis for the entire game in phase 1. So groups as a tank is no problem at all. 
---
Feral unlocks the cat and the bear, so you can tank and play solo, stealth etc.
---
You could also take a look at hunter or warlock.
---
So Gearscore?
---
PvP because PvE feels like you're signing away half of the game. The stories you tell having suffered through STV on a pvp server, on a Wednesday when horde and alliance guilds are getting ready to raid MC and shit hits the fan outside. PvP servers just feels way more fun and more of a full experience of the game. PvE feels like the server you go to if you can't be bothered with any interruptions and want to play the game solely focused on raiding and nothing more.
---
&gt; Yeah recording wouldnt be affected by cpu. 
---
It would for the encoding. Although you can have a gpu that does that too. Still.
---
I use a 980 ti to encode NVENC and when streaming it doesn't write to the HDD or SSD, which takes CPU power. When streaming most of the brunt is the GPU. 
---
It takes me more CPU to record than to stream + the strain on hard disk or SSD whichever one I choose to write to, and both parts are 10+ years old and don't fare very well.
---
It is known.
---
It's optional with no impact on classic experience, so I'm okay with it as an added feature.
---
World buffs are disabled during new raid launches on most pservers now anyways
---
Easy, Thunderfury.
---
Can you link some of those Warrior guides?
---
Im just now in the situation to find good guides, escpecially which weapons i can use through leveling.
---
I havent been super invested into anything for two-three years now. I play 4-5 OW games every couple days but other than that I just really dont care. Tried every game under the sun but nothing sticks. ESO, BDO, Bless, ARK, PoE, MHW, you name it. Only thing I play a lot would be Pokemon Go and maybe aome Skyrim lol. Been outside a lot but I do look forwards to being able to sit at home for an entire day and actually enjoy it and not feel super bored. Im ready!
---
Great work man, have yourself a silver! 
---
And happy cakeday! ^^
---
Basically yes although I don't recall gear score giving better score for having lower item level pieces that were better just going off pure item level.   
---
Classic obviously that wouldn't work but if green hit shoulders that are ilvl 55 are worth 10 points and shitty spirit plate shoulders that are ilvl 60 are worth 3 points etc. That's probably slightly different from how gear scored worked in wrath.
---
In a way Vanilla is for the casual player. Every activity takes an investment of at least time and that makes it feel rewarding especially for casual players. Just getting to do a group quest or see a dungeon/raid was a reward in itself. Getting a group together could easily result in you making a new freind aswell. The leveling process is really a journey that anyone can under take and it takes up soo much of your gameplay experience. 
---
A hardcore player will just try to bypass all the great stuff Vanilla has to offer in order to get the best purple and orange gear ASAP. Plenty to do as a hardcore player but maybe they should have stopped to smell the roses because there are so many of them in Vanilla.
---
No comment on Retail as i have not played since Wotlk.
---
It is definitely a thing while levelling and for pvp. It's not 'meta' in pvp but it is decent situationally. It's definitely a step up from true meme specs like boomkin or enhancement.
---
Yeah i feel left with nothing to do. Too early to play classic wow and too late to play private server...
---
But one thing to keep in mind, is that you *do* find specific people for M+. Even if theyre from a different server and you'll never see them again, you find likeminded people. Meanwhile, dungeons are still hard on Vanilla, but not necessarily hard enough to require voice chat. But neither does Mythic0-10, or however it scales at the moment.
---
But you can certainly find a guild of likeminded people, or include "we have disc, disc preffered" in your LFM posts.
---
The problem is the videos are not realistic, we dont know how alot of things pala wants to use will scale and proc.
---
AND even if everything is like privat servers then you need to farm basicly every consumable in game to even do decent DPS, nots not rly doable, and if you dont your dps sucks.
---
And again there is a big ? if ret will scale like on privat server with basicly every buff in the game.
---
Dont tell anybody.
---
But graphics updates (possibly models 🙊) will be in classic...and my god does it look amazing. Its like a whole new game.
---
If only they would allow texture packs lololol.
---
Why the hell would you make private server unique suggestions that won't work in Classic? Do people enjoy misleading people or what?

I mained druid throughout Vanilla WoW (and all the way to present day, actually). Druid is perfect for playing alone. I should know because the friend that got me into WoW switched sides and went Horde so I had to level solo.. I wouldn't be too worried about dungeons. Druid can play all four roles (tank, melee dps, ranged dps, healer), so find the niche you enjoy and just go for it. It's not progression raiding. No one's going to go "eeew a druid. Class X do 3.5% more dps based on simulations" for a dungeon run.
---
Seriously, there's nothing like preventing a wipe when the healer accidentally gets aggro and dies by shifting out of kitty, casting entangling roots on an add, throwing a nature-swifted max rank healing touch on the tank to keep him ticking, brezing the dead healer, innervating him, then shifting to bear to offtank while the revived healer tops everyone back up.
---
Alchemy has no profession exclusive things at all.
---
It is unfortunate, but Engineering is simply the best profession of WoWC. Have a look at the [Primary profession exclusive benefits - complete list](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bep2sl/primary_profession_exclusive_benefits_complete/) and see for yourself. Every exclusive benefit that other professions can provide will get replaced eventually, maybe except for Smoking Heart of the Mountain (for Bear Druids) and the Blacksmithing skeleton keys from Blacksmithing (but Rogues and Engineers can also open, and people will eventually get the real keys). However, Engineering has by far the highest number of exclusive benefits, and a lot of them will never be replaceable, even after P6 hits.
---
You come across as a giant tool. ;)
---
There's no forced grinding, no daily quests, you can choose factions for rep that you need and take your time getting to Exalted (or whatever you need) - you have 60 levels to do it in.  
---
Since there are no dailies, your time is your own.  It's heaven - you can dally through Ashenvale, looking at flowers, you can chill on the beach in Tanaris - there's no pressure to be doing things, unless you want to.
---
In that sense, yes, it's more casual.  However in terms of mobs suddenly twatting you because your aggro radius is about 3x what your used to, your armour is much less resistant and mob crits hit like a  runaway train, it's more hardcore.

Swings and roundabouts.

The waiting honestly doesn't bother me that much, it's been ten years, but I'm tired of stressing out over when to use my vacation days.

I love that thing. I think it's perfect. Atiesh, to me, demonstrates how you can make something look unique and really stand out without having to make it flashy. I've never mistaken it for any other staff in the very, very few times that I've seen it. It's dat bird, really. And the ribbon (I \*think\* I saw it once or twice).

Well I want 144 for other games too. And I've seen a 21:9 wow streamer and it looks a bit odd.
---
Do you need on all rare BoE drops too?
---
Rogues have several viable builds for PVP: Hemorrhage / Prep / Cold Blood if you don't have a dagger, Ambush spec for if you are trying to one-shot clothies out in the world, daggers with improved sprint, and the list goes on. It's hard to say that any one of these specs are "better" than the other. If I was playing a Rogue and was trying to enjoy world PVP the most, I'd personally go Ambush spec which requires Daggers. Hope this helps.
---
Oops. My bad. Copy and paste error. Thank you for the correction.
---
Is that a serious question?
---
And the energy required for more than 1 backstab comes from where exactly ? The government ?
---
So is the reckoning build not viable for leveling then in retail?
---
Was pretty close to 12 in vanilla on 2 chars, while raiding - it's definitely doable.
---
I know I will at the beginning but the worst of it usually wears off in a month or two so I'm not too concerned.
---
How do you practice landing your grenades if you can't use them in duel ?
---
Glad to see people who were 3 when this game came out are interested. Just shows how much of an impact it has had on the MMO community.

I plan on playing again in classic, but will be casual due to job, wife, kids....hence why I’m getting a good gaming laptop so I can play from the sofa, while still being sociable to the wife once the kids are sleeping 😂👍

It is somewhat amusing to see people who know very little claim so much.

From the author of The Guide to Reckoning that was stickied in the Paladin forums:
---
&gt;Got linked over to this post from I assume Theloras, and I can shed a little light on Reckoning. Some of the info from my 14 year old guide was a little out-of-date: IIRC when the sticky dropped I stopped updating the guide.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Normally** if you're sitting down **you would not get Reckoning charges** from auto-attacks. **However**, you could **gain charges from random NPCs by constantly sitting and standing up due to server lag**: mob would try to attack you as your were sitting, so it'd be a forced crit. However, **if you stood up just as you were getting hit, the server would see you as if you were standing and get a Reckoning charge.** I learned this by chance after showing a buddy of mine how Reckoning worked, and he just did some guess-work, pulled a scorpion outside of Gadgetzon, got 4 charges and then went and one-shot a level 42 guy in town. He would do this for hours and it was a masterpiece to watch.  
---
&gt;I also assume this is the trick the rogue and paladin used to get enough charges to one-shot Kazzak that one time.  
---
&gt;As for mounting: if one had 4 Reckoning charges and then mounted--they're gone. However, one could Acquire Reckoning charges while mounted and retain them after dismounting. I would (ab)use this to charge into Orgrimmar/Grom'gol/Cenarion Hold and bomb someone before the guards/duelers would kill me.  
---
&gt;Thanks for the blast from the past. And my opinion is if it's going to be Classic WoW, "fixing" this would be kind of detracting from the original game imo.

Pay attention to the instructions - you have to press X repeatedly to sit down - stand up - sit down - stand up. This would not be part of the necessary steps if this was prior to the fix that allowed for the generation of charges simply by sitting down and waiting for a hit.
---
Kinda serious. The spreadsheets came from simming what the best upgrades were, no?
---
Prot paladin is worse than ret.
---
Sounds like a plan!
---
Why not just buy a proper desktop gaming rig at that point?
---
I wish Blizzard published real time statistics about servers so that we could choose where to go.
---
Is that true? I'd love for that to be the case. I want vanilla for the gameplay, I'd much rather the graphics were better.
---
MCP doesn't have a cooldown, you can just use one charge after the other. You lose the haste effect if you change weapon.
---
How far apart are the phases going to be? Are like people going to have finished Molten Core and Onyxia by the time Black Wing drops?  My concern is that I'm going to be really pressured to grind so I don't fall behind. I plan on maining a hunter which is tough enough raid spot wise. I'm also hoping I'll have time to level my warrior alt.
---
Vanilla to BC to Wrath, with servers left behind for each iteration. Easy, cost effective, satisfies everyone.
---
Cata onward is when subs started to swan dive, so theres less of a reason and necessity to provide the downward trend versions of the game.
---
Personally, BC&gt;Vanilla&gt;Wrath. Vanilla is great, but BC made PVE more exciting and the classes more developed, while not sacrificing the class diversity. PVP suffered from fliers though. And Wrath is fun, but it started the trend towards modernization, much more than BC. BC had 1 raid difficulty, Wrath had fucking 4, BC had a group finder tool, Wrath had one that paired you with strangers from another server and teleported you there. BC had badges of justice, but they were hard to get. Meanwhile, heroic 5 mans were a cakewalk for 99% of Wrath.
---
I quit private servers the moment the announced Classic Live on blizzcon. I didn't want to "use up" my nostalgia there. I was shaking in excitement.
---
But I bought a playstation pro before christmas and have been playing the living $hit out of it. Time flies 😁
---
It is kind of beautiful that old WoW died with it's main villain, from Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne. It's like it reached it's logical conclusion, and then killed itself to save face.
---
I don't play a lot of games, but I'm in the process of having 100% on Red Dead Redemption 2, I hope it will be finish before Classic comes out.
---
You're absolutely right, I slept my way through quest chains in leveling zones that set me up as some great commander, then LFR'd the literal Satan of Wow. I am truly the greatest there ever was.
---
Just waiting for Sylvanas to get the axe so I can be crowned Warchief after I single-handedly save Saurfang (again). Wouldn't honestly be surprised at this point.
---
If it isn't obvious by now, I'm just not sold on the storytelling as it incorporates the game loop. Blizzard can write some good stories when they want to, but if I don't feel like I've earned all this praise, honestly I dunno what to say.
---
Really nice song! And quite funny too tbh :D   
---
If this would get on Spotify, then I'd definitely add it to my playlist!

Well done!

Mainly swords and axes.

2004, few times a week, didn't click. 2005-6, daily. Took a break, WotLK dropped, played daily until Cataclysm. Tried Cata, was shit, haven't played since, except Nost when I fooled around seeing if the magic was still there.
---
Do you honestly think a guild would waste 40 Splinters which could take months to gather on a low tier DPS so he can *sometimes* use it when he's feeling lazy? While it could be a much better upgrade for a much higher DPS or healer **all the time**?
---
It's a meme. Holy paladins will supply you with enough buffs anyway and warriors scale better with gear. A good, well geared fury warrior will ALWAYS out dps an equally good and geared ret.
---
Pretty decent
---
&gt; I'd be open to them also releasing new content for classic
---
I kind of am, too, but theres a genuine worry there. Imagine that the current WoW team built a raid for Classic, and it was like... just, pure shit. Dragon Soul, if it was made by the off team instead. Then, this awful jammed-in raid is making legitimate raids like Naxx/AQ/BWL/MC/ZG more obsolete, and instead were encouraged to, pretty much, play a retail raid. 
---
Theres nothing wrong with retail raids, but I don't enjoy them as much as Vanilla/BC/Wrath gameplay-focused raids. Theyre just designed from a different standpoint, and it feels like a DDR dance step-chart, instead of a fun MMORPG D&amp;D style encounter.
---
I agree!
---
I feel like Cata was a soft attempt at Wow2, that ended up failing..
---
But isnt it hot in California
---
This is amazing! I never wanted something like this on my wall at home. Can I somehow buy a copy or something so I can get a high quality version that I can make a large print off?
---
If you mean modern character models, thats probably not going to happen.
---
Buy herbs and regents inbetween raids and sell them during. Easy 1:2 flip
---
Vanilla and BC was everyday for an unhealthy amount of time. Ever since then its been declining hard, Cataclysm - BfA has been the same process of playing on release, playing for a month or so after hitting max level which usually took within a day. I never felt that same thing that compelled me to play after they started simplifying everything and adding catch up content which i began to notice around the time of ICC. 
---
When i come back to classic wow i imagine i will be back to playing a lot, maybe not as much considering life obligations change but i will have a lot more fun than in recent years for sure.
---
I'm sure there will be a google-able list of what servers each streamer will announce that they play on once we get a list.
---
If streamers are really that dumb as to announce it beforehand anyway.
---
Other than that, no.
---
Because they don't cate about what they say as long as it gets them a 10 min video
---
Excellent point. I think most people agree to use certain consumables with whomever they are dueling, rather than randomly duel someone and start throwing out grenades.
---
Thanks for providing more info and sources. While it seems true that pressing X repeatedly worked in vanilla because of server lag, I think it's safe to assume this behaviour won't be present in Classic. I'm guessing the modern server architecture and improvements during the last 13 years have eliminated the "pressing X repeatedly"-bug. I also don't think Blizzard will try to recreate this bug. But who knows, especially since they are recreating spell batching.
---
I have been working on my 1-60 alliance leveling guide, using a warrior to hit 60 in 5d /played on a fresh server...
---
its accurate but incomplete, so i haven't shared it much, but if you are looking for a guide you can check it out.
---
up to lvl 47 so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI_tihYa_Mk&amp;list=PLiIDj0gsjp3Ci8YDgs12T83TWYvzQymHn&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s
---
&gt;I love high skill ceiling characters in games, so if they're good but difficult that's even better!
---
well then hunter is a good pick for you. They are both good and the ceiling is very high.
---
Hunter is really good in pvp early on but starts to fall off in end game gear. I mean it's still fine but you won't be 2 shotting clothies anymore like you did fresh at 60.
---
Oh, look! Two of my favorite things combined. Warcraft and metal. 
---
This is fantastic stuff!
---
You'll likely always be a little behind crafting if you don't spend time grinding for mats, but it's absolutely worth it for the fun and feeling of accomplishment. 
---
To be able to use the shrinking ray on dungeon bosses and help your guildies with gear--and to benefit from their professions in return. It adds a lot to the leveling experience too since you might choose to journey somewhere for specific mats or trainers.
---
PvP servers are more dynamic. The non consensual PvP adds another layer to the game that is absent on PvE servers. There is always a possibllity of a player of the other faction being around the corner. You have to play more carefully. Also on PvP servers you are kind of forced to put talent points into PvP talents that wouldn't really be helpful in leveling or dungeons/raids. So there is an evaluation going on of how many pvp talents can you have without hurting your PvE performance.
---
PvE servers are probably the best for players who care about raiding but don't really care about the rest of the game much. You can just ignore any PvP, level quickly and get into raiding without being distracted. It's a more scripted experience.
---
It's not, not without enrage-on-will. Look at the talents, you get literally nothing past 5/5 Cruelty that helps you kill stuff in any way until Death Wish. That's 15 'wasted' talent points of the 20 available on level 29. Don't level 2H Fury on classic.
---
Why do you need this? Why can't you just enjoy the game textures as they were?
---
Man, that sort of thing happened to me as a kid. I was huge into pokemon and lived two streets over from Moonstone St.
---
i've never made an Alliance character.  
---
i keep continuing that legacy
---
Hi, /u/Gennaken
---
It would be nice if it blanked out any other choices once you reach the lvl 60 cap, currently it feels like I should be able to place more talents. Other than that its a good site mate, will be using it. Cheers.
---
Awesome, thanks for your insight!
---
Will the paladin/warlock level 60 mounts be available in phase 1 or are they something that was added later?
---
Don't give up the hope until there is an actual server list. The community has been pretty vocal about wanting RpPvP servers.
---
I will also be going PvP if there is no RpPvP server available. But still hoping for one.
---
I'm okay with not two shotting people lol, as long as I have a chance and don't fall off into garbage tier it's all good, thank you!
---
Hunter is one of the strongest and most underrated class in wow classic.
---
Back in vamilla i was a hunter with T2 equip, trust me.
---
Lol same!
---
This also what I've heard.
---
I just remember the log in queues, and then the 30-40 min BG queues on Lagrock in vanilla. Org was like a slideshow when I first started out.
---
People who played the game for years might want a fresh look or the option to go to classic view and modern view, it’s user side, why do you care what i see or prefer as long as it’s on our end? We’d just like the option.
---
Man, I already am in a sense. I think about it in some capacity every day. Not obsessively, but like a song will remind me of a WoW memory and I will be pulled down the rabbit hole that way. I think about what I will role. I think about leveling in specific areas in different zones (high perch? in 1 k needles, pirates in Tanaris, nesingwary STV). I think about farming and leveling professions. I think about shooting the shit with guildies drunk at 3 am. 
---
Yeah, I will be addicted, but I have enough self control to maintain a healthy relationship with my gf, continue with my Masters, and go to work. I might be sacrificing some sleep and social outings, but my life will be stable. Itll be healthier for me than my stim addiction. 
---
I cant fucking wait, my dude. I cant fucking wait.
---
Good suggestion! I'll have a look at putting that in, cheers
---
Exactly if my wife and kid don't leave me Blizzard have failed.
---
Jesus Christ man, this was how I felt back in 2004-2005
---
This sort of little detail is going to be such a culture shock to so many players. They're going to realise very quickly how much of the game is currently handed to them "on a plate", so to speak. Just the concept of having to manually find groups is going to be a struggle for a lot of players imo.
---
Can you explain the dagger? Why is it better? Are there exeptions?
---
I can't tap and hold to remove points in the combat tree :( 
---
Else yeah, looks good on mobile
---
It really depended on the RpPvP server you're playing on. I used to play on RpPvP Kult der Verdammten (German) and there was a lot of Rp even on horde side.
---
The problem with Rp and RpPvP servers is that the Rpers tend to flock to the Rp and RpPvP server with the most rp. So the remaining kind of get left out and just end up as glorified PvP and PvE realms. That is why I think there should only be one RpPvP and one Rp server per region.
---
I couldn't get it to work wit manual presses so I used a macro that just spams the button at 5000 apm. You can't backstab more than once but a backstab at early levels is the same as a 5 point eviscerate in terms of damage.
---
Corrupted Ashbringer narrowly wins out over Atiesh.
---
I had a 16/10 LCD back then. Cost me something like 650€ and I remember being worried that it wouldn't last long (LCD durability was an unknown quantity back then). 
---
This monitor has survived all those years and is my second monitor nowadays.
---
Your mistake is in thinking that grinding R14 requires high level PvP. It doesn't, in fact it's the opposite: grinding R14 is about avoiding high level PvP and stomping noobs.
---
And while you might say 'well that's the exception, most people aren't assholes and won't queue dodge etc etc' you'd be wrong - because all it takes is one premade queue dodging to make it mandatory for all the others to; that's how the honor system works.

I think you misspelled “expect blizzard to pushback classic wow any day now.”

You sound like you never played actively on a P-serv or tried 1.12.1

eitherway classic is a game of consumables, and you need all the space u can possibly achieve to contain it all.

lol well done defending blizzard honor officer bootlicker
---
Should be pretty decent
---
considering Shamans and Paladins
---
Druids are great for raids and dungeons, everyone wants you but only if you heal. Tank druids are good, but warriors are always preferred. And feral is actually great but they still hold a reputation of being worse than other dps because not many feral actually know how to make them viable. So you get stuck with healing if you want consistent groups. For me healing was actually more fun than dps but it makes gold farming quite a challenge however there are methods of farming as a druid healer. This can also be helped by levelling a mage/hunter or whatever else purely for farming. 
---
You can find getting raid gear very easy as a resto druid as well so if you decide to join a raiding guild, even as a sub/casual raid member which are needed considering getting the same 40 people on every raid night is a challenge in itself.   
---
Pvp is fun as a resto druid, i always had fun being relatively unkillable but the novelty wares off unless you're in a premade, well it did for me anyway.
---
This is just my 2c on my experience as a druid in vanilla, hope it helped.
---
You wont twoshot ppl or make insane burst.
---
But Hunter is the class with the highst skill floor and ceiling.
---
A "bad" hunter is a joke, a good hunter in open pvp is a unbeatable beast for most classes, and the best hunters can even perform well in duels.
---
That beeing said, i only met 1 hunter in all my time on privat servers that could perform so good that you would basicly said hunter is the strongst class. Against "good" ppl you make one very small mistake you are done for, atleast in duel, in open pvp you have more room to work with.
---
I highly doubt this, it honestly seems on schedule right now. I'd expect a beta announcement either next week or the week after to be honest.
---
Depends how much I will be ganked. If my alt is higher lvl than my main, you know the situation is pretty much out of control :D
---
You should do it immediately when joining a PvP server, it gives you a good idea if a place is getting raided and if it is worth your time leveling there.
---
Just as long as you’re being honest
---
I want to strenuously object to this but... meh... what are you wearing?
---
That once happened to me with a book series I had been a fan of for years.
---
One day I thought to myself "Hey, I should check and see if (author) is already working on the next book in the series!".
---
So I went online and found out the book was to be released the next day. It felt great.
---
What if it made casting animations more obvious or allowed you to make things like the WSG flag more obvious?
---
Brings up a good question on what recipes/patterns will be in the game at what phases. These professions get so much better once everything is unlocked.
---
I've pretty much watched every YouTube video about it.
---
Best of luck! I've been in there, went on a job interview once. It was probably the most difficult interview I've done, but that could just be my nervousness jading my perception. Did not get it. Nice area though.
---
That is a very disturbing picture!
---
Just get an end of dreams. Drops in the same instance after all.
---
Helpful to remember this is not a traditional game, it may not have a traditional game release date
---
Same. No game sunk its teeth into my like WoW. The teeth came out in the first week of Cata, and I've never played it again.
---
By now a release date or a beta announcement could come any day. It's a surprise we haven't gotten one yet.
---
It's pretty much what Blizzard does with every single game they ever bring out. Announcement to Release is usually something between one and two years.  This is pretty much why I didn't hype myself up too early at BC 2017. Now that we're approaching a beta / release, however, I feel myself getting hyped up. But that's ok, as we're only about 4-6 months away from release :P (personally I do NOT expect a Q3 release anymore, it's just too late for that)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18592
---
As far as I remember all you need to do is pay the 1 sulfuron ingot fee and you'll get these plans, don't think you need macesmithing for it. Then again, 1 ingot is a pretty hefty price so if someone else on your server can make it already, might as well save it for the actual sulfuras completion
---
It's either viable or it's just the meme? Those are the only two options, extremes at either end?
---
I'd be willing to bet that at least a little part of it is the people who you play with, your guild members, your friends, and people who would bring you along in a raid or a dungeon even if you are Rhett and you are not 100% maximized DPS for that slot
---
&gt;If you jump into vanilla with a power gaming, must play every spare moment mentality, you’ll be bored with it in a few months
---
Nah bro, I gotta hit level 60 in the first week of release so I can start raiding immediately.
---
Throughout all the Classic blue posts they kept the idea of a "Classic Summer" alive. If we would get it later than that, they probably would have said so already.
---
This is actually a really nice tool. Well done.
---
You using GitHub Pages to host the site? I use it for some stuff. Good times.
---
True true.
---
Have you ever tried just not doing cocaine for a day or two, and instead cooking a nice dinner and watching a movie? I find it really keeps me from being addicted.
---
/sit doesn't work on mobs to generate crits on yourself in 1.12. ReckoningProt is totally viable for leveling if you're duoing with a class that can AoE (Lock or Mage) but Ret is better if you're soloing  
---
Blacksmithing is painful to level and most of what it provides can just be bought anyway. Herbs tend to make the best money early of the gathering professions
---
five pushups for every PvE-related death. Gonna be ripped!
---
The downfall of Wow was when Activision started pandering to Casuals and younger players(tweens and under).  When I started playing WoW it was hard....some of it was me being a noob but even later when I knew the tactics , rules and the theorycraft to the game I still had a good amount of corpse runs and getting those choice dungeon pieces or finishing the long quest chains/keys/attunements required socializing and working together with people that added another dimension to the game's difficulty.  I left when Wrath was released and tried starting again in Mists.  I absolutely hated it....dungeon runs felt so empty and useless....just a mob of players rushing through with no teamwork or cooperation.  
---
My hope is that classic and maybe classic BC will be popular enough  that casuals can play current retail and classic will cater to a more mature, polite and reasonable subset of the gaming community after the initial re-newedness wears off.
---
Incredible. I would happily pay for a high enough resolution to print out.
---
Just to add that a 0/30/21 druid can also offtank this fight with some feral gear.
---
Its only frowned upon by the unprepared. I say do everything you can to win and if they complain then they're just mad that they lost. Frowning upon this kind of stuff is just people trying to justify the fact that they cant be bothered to do more than the bare minimum.
---
&gt;The fact that there's an end
---
If you think that after Classic WoW makes them an ass ton of money, that they aren't going to do Classic Burning Crusade, you crazy.
---
Those people will get to feed their addiction again well before the content runs dry.
---
Nothing is definitive as long as Blizzard is a slavering peon under the yoke of the tyrannical big boi mega corporate bosses of Activision.
---
Activision tells blizzard to jump and blizzard responds: How high m'lord?
---
You just blew that 12 year old's mind
---
And both are worse than a troll rogue.
---
Modern animations can make casting animations more obvious and if we're talking terrain textures and models for things like flags in pvp then that is even worse.
---
&gt; Engineering is pretty solid too
---
Repair bot.

I recently leveled a paladin on Pserver without using the /sit macro.

What worked well for me was "AoE" leveling, it really becomes relevant at lvl 30 tho, when you get blessing of sanctuary in the prot tree.
---
For the 30 first lvl I'd recommend going ret with a nice 2H weapon and when hitting lvl 30 switch to prot and get yourself a good shield and weapon.
---
Fight 2-4 mobs at the same time (depending on your gear) and try to only fight mobs like wolf, jaguar,... fast attack speed for slow damage, your blessing of sanctuary will be more efficient against those type of enemy and you'll stack reckoning faster.
---
As you don't need to spend your money on a mount at lvl 40 you can get a nice Fiery weapon enchant to increase the damage of your reckoning and shield spike, that shit good as fuck against fast attack speed mobs.
---
For the profession, mining and blacksmithing is a good combo if you keep it to the max lvl otherwise you'll only be able to craft items that are 8-15 lvl below yours so be ready to grind some cave but that's cool if you go with the "AoE" spec since mobs in cave are packed together.
---
I would pick Engineering over BS because overall it's more useful but it's also more time consuming and a gold sink.
---
1 by 1. Vanilla mechanics assumes you engage one mob at a time unlike retail so there is no need for aoe looting.
---
And loot trading only affects raiding items, just to clarify.
---
AoE loot is not going to be in classic, so yes, you have to loot one by one.
---
I believe (can't confirm) they're available with dire maul
---
You’re not bothering to read it because you know what he’s saying is correct.
---
From what we've seen so far - no. It will most likely be 1 by 1.
---
It gives crit chance.
---
I would argue that its probably not worth it. At least not for me. My entire goal when leveling a character is to get the next level as fast as possible, especially so for my first character as having a level 60 character allows you to make more money in a shorter time span.
---
Crafting takes time away from the grind, so I always just picked up two gathering professions. Sold most of it, kept some of it for when/if I decided I wanted to even have a crafting profession. 
---
Gets you the level 40 mount pretty easily in my experience.
---
The only facts in this thread
---
Which is funny because 5% bonus damage against half the mobs in the game is always called useless.
---
I don't think ''Uncle'' Thomas is my real uncle
---
When was the last time Blizzard pushed back a release?
---
It will most likely be 1 by 1.
---
I saw a video on YT going into the hard theorycrafting behind it and basically fast 1h's had the highest reliable average DPS, whereas 2h had slow average but potential for high random spikes (when you actually proc).
---
I'm confused. Doesn't professions work the same in the current WoW?
---
/LFG will probably by the main/only world channel and it will be used in the same manner as /world is on private servers, that is both and LFG and as a trade.
---
Hunters are a very strong PvP class, especially in unstructured open world PvP or in BGs, less so in duels.
---
There are many bad Hunters, and if you're a bad Hunter then the class is amongst the weakest in PvP, because their vulnerabilities are easily exploited if the Hunter himself is incapable of mitigating them. The deadzone in particular: if you can get inside and stay inside their deadzone you can kill them while taking almost no damage.
---
An ok Hunter will fare reasonably well in PvP and a good Hunter will be amongst the most dangerous enemies.
---
I wonder how much higher dps a 1h mace needs to beat that rule?
---
I'll be rolling warrior  
---
What will be the most efficient spec to play ?  
---
i've read different theories and guides.
---
  
---
2H Furry, untill 40 then respec to Arms. &lt;-- is this the way to go ?
---
When was the last time they over dedicated their team to releasing a reworked version of vanilla world of Warcraft too early?
---
You sisn't answer my question.
---
Pretty much, there's no means, at least to my knowledge, to guarantee you get critically struck now.
---
You aren’t wrong
---
Also for tanking, crazy threat generation with it.
---
what kind of graphics card are you using?
---
Play what you really like, im sure u will be able to find a guild that will accept you, but if they accept you in raid roster at least try to do everything you can to farm the consumes and do at least decent dps.
---
I recomend watching a few Esfand videos about retry pally in raid.
---
Personally I'd choose whatever had the best DPS stat, no point toiling over theorycraft when upgrades are right around the corner.
---
*priest main intensifies*
---
The hype train in me says release date announcement but I think it would be very well received if they announced server lists. Other possibilities are beta (even if internal/closed) since their CDN version updated, they might drop a very small bluepost about WoW tokens being in/not being in (hopefully not) Classic, or they could talk in some more detail about modern BNet and how it integrates into Classic (particularly the whole community thing that seems to be phasing in to replace guilds in Retail, from what I understand).
---
The hype train says release date. But there's still a few reasonably major unknowns they can use their bluepost to explain before having to give a date.
---
viable? yes. optimal? no.
---
If you plan on PvPing a lot on your way to 60 go for it. But Reckoning won't do anything for you during questing/grinding.
---
A couple of months would have been ideal. I actually found out about it around this time last year. So I guess I have not had it quite as bad as some.
---
You’re right though. It’s taking a toll on me.
---
Pack it up boys u/craghack_tv has done two lines of basic division. 
---
Blizzard's lead game designer is nothing on this rocket scientist.
---
Why does everyone ignore the fact that trolls get a flat 5% damage bonus against half the mobs in the game as well as beserking?
---
Been staying healthy so far this year, only 1 day where I had to call in sick. Gotta save up those sick days for July, I already feel the cold coming...
---
Holly shit that must have taken a lot of time lol nice work =) too bad you don't have a written guide as well ! Gl hf and nice videos
---
2h Fury is based off of PServer /sit macros which won't work come Classic. Arms is the way to go, especially on PvP servers. Check out the deep dive with Monkeynews on YT for his leveling spec.
---
Of course it is, you just have to get reck procs the old fashioned way.
---
Is arms the best leveling spec in classic then?
---
I think so, too. I can remember leveling in Loch Modan as the chat was implemented and seeing nothing else than spam\^\^
---
Warrior? Then you could get 3 out of the four on display.
---
Probably true. Cargo is so much better. I can't stand passengers.
---
Why do you even duel?
---
You are talking about world firsts. I'm talking about everyone else.
---
Alright..
---
The reason I want to know is because (hope I won't trigger you here XD), I plan on shaman tanking all the dungeons. I've heard the dagger is important because it's the most reliable/consistent applier of Rockbiter, which is a flat bonus and mandatory for threat.. but when lvling outside, it isn't too important then?
---
Sulfuron on my Hybrid-Enhancer as a PvEler.

---
You still haven't explained why would it take more CPU power to route the data to a HDD than to a network card. The data is the same and the overhead isn't bigger with HDDs. That is the ONLY difference when streaming or recording to a disk.
---
My uncle, who knows the guy who mows one of the dev's lawn said the same.
---
Most pservers now are basically 50/50, I would take that as a good indicator
---
Bloodfury is much better than berserking. Now if you're speaking about style and elegance ... ;-)
---
My life doesn't draw meaning from the game. I will enjoy it when it is released - but I can wait.
---
Basicly to stay ahead of the Pack.
---
To explain this further:
---
If u invest alot of time early u get alot of "double dipping value " from it
---
-lets say u take 1day vacation and save 1day /played while leveling because ur higher level then orhers and ur in a zone where u can farm alone without having to wait for respawn
---
-same goes for gathering professions. First players enter the zone can gather lotus/herbs/mines
---
-professions in generell: first lionhearth helmet in ah sells for much more then the 300th
---
The gold/h u can make early on is like 10times higher then later
---
Tldr: the more ur ahead of the pack the more time/money u can save
---
Sorry for bad english
---
Does leaving behind life count?
---
There is a blue post saying loot trading is only possible in 20 an 40 man raids.
---
Aoe loot is one thing I wish they would implement #nochangesbut
---
Yes, if the guy in question is a good guild member. Aetiesh is the ultimate weapon, it isn't something that helps your progress because there isn't anything to progress in. Especially by the time you've gathered 40 splinters.
---
This is actually pretty incredible man, keep this up it’s quality content.
---
 Quick question do you think you’ll be able to pick up enough herbs on classic launch to not have alchemy really slow you down?
---
&gt; 2H Furry, untill 40 then respec to Arms. &lt;-- is this the way to go 
---
Yeah, pretty much. The first few rows of the Arms tree are pretty negligible for leveling and are much better suited for warriors that do have some gear. Sure, deep wounds is great at 60, but you won't be critting too much while leveling. Anger management is neat but not required, the first talents that really feel somewhat exciting are 2H specialization and sweeping strikes. 
---
Fury on the other hand has quite a few useful talents right from the get go, like Cruelty, Blood Craze (which procs pretty often while leveling IME) and improved Slam, which I always found to be nifty to help push through that last gauntlet on your way to 40. 
---
But at 40, you get MS, which pretty much invalidates a lot of what Fury has to offer.
---
So its pretty much confirmed. Thank god we have such reliable sources.
---
The game is largely divided by Pre and Post Cata.
---
Totally different game.
---
The warlock quests take you into DM West for the final summoning. I believe paladins have to faff around with horse ghosts or something in DM as well. I think we can safely say they won't be available in Phase 1, since DM doesn't open up until Phase 2.
---
Hunters are still pretty good in early progression, and MC and Ony are likely going to be finished by mostly everyone (who has been 60 for at least a week or two) by the time BWL comes out. 
---
MC and Ony really aren't all that difficult, BWL is a bit of a challenge but still extremely doable casually. The first real roadblock will be AQ40 in my opinion.
---
Releasing classic might hurt private server populations badly and this might make some servers close their doors before players come back(if blizz fucks up classic)? Or am i totally wrong?
---
I donno what type of players private servers have. Do they play there because they dont have better option, or because its free?
---
There is World for that (player created channel)
---
I leveled with tailoring and it was pretty cool.
---
I played a priest with my friend playing a lock and I could make us some nice think like the blue boots lvl 20, our first green hat lvl 26 (that shit sell like crazy at the AH), the dreamweave set at lvl 40 and so on.
---
As long as you keep it to the max lvl it'll be rewarding but if you don't make it a priority while leveling you won't be able to craft nice gear for your lvl and then it's just a waste of time.
---
To my knowledge, after instructing a /sit you will be critically hit. But it will not award a reckoning stack from said crit.
---
Very good, thank you.
---
Minor suggestion you take too much height for the logo and class icons so the talent progression is not visible on a standard 16:9 1080p screen.
---
And that is what a company that supposedly cares for thier game and not just cash should think about.
---
Do you switch to a higher level weapon when mcp is on cd?
---
There's zero evidence that it will work but also zero evidence that it wouldn't work.  
---
And no, the demo does actually not count because it didn't have spell batching, and I'm pretty sure that spell-batching is crucial for it to work.  
---
I'm fairly certain that you were able to frontstab if you danced around enough prior to the WoD Spell Batch change. Do I have a screenshot? Obviously noone has a record or screenshot of this because noone thought something like that would ever become relevant, so it's not surprising noone has any proof.
---
I don't see why you wouldn't cover fronstabbing in a guide considering there's still the possbility for it to actually work.
---
First, because of Spellbatching  
---
Secondly, you could just try to replicate the latency by slowing down your connection to the server.  
---
Still, no guarantee it might be in the retail version classic, but you might as well mention it in case it DOES work.
---
Sometimes I feel like this sub is just riding the anti private server train a bit too hard
---
I would expect that they keep tokens in retail only, and ~~force~~ encourage people to play retail to bolster the player numbers, even if people would only get gold enough to buy a token, and head back to vanilla. I will just pay for my sub.
---
Someone left a sign outside of WotC head office to ban a card in magic.... Why not start leaving notes outside!
---
This is exaclty what I was looking for. Perfect answer. Thank you!
---
Prove me wrong or insult me, you've already made the choice it seems.
---
Bethesda has proven that can work (old Bethesda not the greedy shitty new one)
---
ok, which class fits best for you when looking at class fantasy and aesthetics is something you have to find out yourself.
---
The question is, how do you plan to play Classic? Will you play a lot?, Do you play mainly solo, or do you want to raid? How far do you want to get in PvP?
---
While lock doesn't have a talent to improve wands, they're still pretty important for them early levels, as they outdamage Shadow Bolt without costing mana or being interrupted while taking damage.
---
Bobby Kottick is that stupid.
---
It's PvP, the goal is to beat the opponent, whatever it costs.
---
If you die and you didn't use the potion sitting in your bag then you're not honorable, you're just dumb.
---
Timbermaw / Argent Dawn rep isn't forced grinding? I mean you don't have to do it but it will make your life a lot harder if you don't.
---
To test pvp skills ,  not to test how well you can chug consumables you have to farm/pay for. Or you telling me using all your best consumables to duel ? Ask everyone around you for buffs etc ?
---
Can we be friends?
---
I know it's supposed to be a hybrid, but this spec looks mildly awful for PvP as it lacks pretty important talents. Could work, but I think you'll feel worse in both PvP and PvE than you would with proper specs. Personally, I'd rather invest some time farming Maraudon/DM when it comes out to cover respec costs.
---
Maybe the mechanics are more grindy, but dungeons in vanilla are still harder. In retail you pretty much never have to stop, you can just keep pulling and going. In vanilla, if you pull a pack too much, even in Deadmines, you're dead.
---
I don't agree with that at all, and your analogy makes no sense tbh. We're not talking about an every day chore, we're talking about a videogame. Did those QoL make the game a lot easier? Yes they did. It removed a lot of challenges that certain classes faced and had to deal with.
---
They always have announcement 2-4 months from release date on any game or expansion they've released the past 15 years (from what I could tell) so I don't think it'll be different now.
---
Well, if it's planned to release between July and September it's not a surprise we haven't got one yet, since then they'd announce it earlier than they usually do.
---
This is why vanilla is awesome... it doesn’t matter what the ilevel is it’s about thinking outside the box to maximise the numbers
---
&gt; old timers who have had every conversation and have seen every question
---
You really only have to stick around for a couple hours to see everything in triplicate.
---
Don't know about Norway, but in some countries you can cash out your vacation if you don't want to take one
---
Itemization and gearing is much more streamlined in classic. 
---
Does it have more spell damage? Your spells will do more damage.
---
More int? A little more spellcrit (around 60 int = 1% spell crit i think) and mana
---
flat increased spell crit? Nice!
---
Items just tell you what they do without the endless need of simming.
---
[Staff of Jordan](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=873/staff-of-jordan) for example: 
---
* a little bit of mana and manareg (ofc that int converts to spellcrit too)
---
* \+26 dmg/healing to all spells
---
Most of the onhits were not that good. (Ironfoe and a few others are exceptions)
---
Oh hell yeah, I’ve had my share of BR and MOBA for now time to play classic
---
You are becoming a responsible adult.
---
I'm proud of you.
---
I wouldn't say far from perfect. I would say they are closer to perfect than not.
---
You're just playing down BfA because that content is meaningless to you. When you compare each aspect of vanilla to BfA you can't deny BfA is more casual.
---
You can take your time levelling in BfA as well, but in BfA, you can easily solo any levelling content and never have to interact with others or fight for mobs. 
---
In vanilla, okay, raiding may not be as inaccessible as it was, but still, you need to put in some serious time and effort in order to get a raiding spot in a good guild. Raiding guilds just will not take you if you put less effort in than the next guy. In BfA, you can queue up for LFR while doing your world quests and do your raids without having to try hard. 
---
I see a lot of people here bringing up the same point of "you can take your time and smell the roses" in vanilla, and yes, you can, but does that make it more casual? I feel like you're just projecting because you personally like vanilla a lot more.
---
Thanks.  
---
I want to level as efficiently as possible regarding talents and spec.  
---
Level 60, i will respec to somewhat Prot warrior, or what my guilds needs me to be, but i want to be able to tank dungeons along the way and eng game.
---
The best thing about no hardcore sharing is no hardcore sharding. Thinking about how they split everything up into shards which completely destroyed the world we had really hurts.
---
Do you live in Brexxit? Just curious.
---
To you.
---
You arn't able to deduce points in lower tier talents if you have higher tiers talents. Even though you have more than enough to reach to the higher tiers.
---
Example: Protection Warrior, You can't reduce talents in \[Anticipation\] if you have 5 points in both \[Shield Specialization\] and \[Iron Will\] and 1 point in \[Improved Shield Block\]
---
[https://i.imgur.com/6svGYuD.png](https://i.imgur.com/6svGYuD.png)
---
See I disagree with that. Yes the content is a lot more fulfilling in vanilla, but is it really meant for casuals? If you pull a mob too many you're dead and you probably have to run back to your corpse for 10-15 minutes. Most corpseruns were bad. If you run out of reagents or drinks or food you could be screwed and have to take a long trip back to a town or city. Will casuals really put up with that? Do casuals not just want easy content they can steamroll through?
---
Timbermaw you just need to get to friendly to get through the hold (and a lot of classes can stealth/blink/invis through), and it doesn't take long.
---
I never got any form of rep with Argent Dawn in vanilla, beyond a little for quests in plaguelands, I certainly didn't grind it for any reason.  I rarely ran Strat/Scholo as well, so it was never really a necessity for me.
---
We're all friends.... Nay, BROTHERS IN ARMS. All yerning for the overthrow of Robert "Big-boy-bobby" Kotick, and in its ashes shall arise a new order, that will shake the very foundations of the world.
---
I've never played Alliance before and I think this is the perfect opportunity to make everything new again since I've never played vanilla either. Played melee classes all the time so I'll roll human mage, can't wait!
---
As much as I agree, casuals keep games running, so without all this stuff, wow may have ended by now.
---
This is why classic, and being same subscription as retail, has the potential to be so good. The game in its original format  and then the current game, with all the changes running together.
---
100% this’s. Raids are a different thing but for small groups - I don’t want to hear someone’s  squeaky voice and wear a headset.
---
Any reputations in BfA aren't a necessity for RP'ers. If you have any PvE ambitions beyond 5-man dungeons you'll have to face that grind tho.
---
Amazing work!!

[Opinions?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FBNNWVV)
---
I played classic as hunter and it was a blast ... throughout leveling you are usually absurdly strong (Beast Mastery) and if you play well and use engineering you eat alive most enemies 
---
End game pvp ... I didn't start from beginning of wow (I had no money for computer) and I reached lvl 60 a 2 months before tBC so I managed to get gear something around T1 power lvl ... and still I was able to fight those ultra end game geared players ... don't get me wrong I wasn't the master of pvp ... I was young ... but now knowing all aspects of game I will play hunter again and really use all this class offer ... it will be disgustingly glorious:P ... 
---
To quantify my opinion I will write my kill count ... it was around 50k ... little? A lot? ... dunno ... for me it was a blast :) 
---
As for end game pve I don't get ppl ... I never had problems with a spot dor raiding ... I was mainly pvp player ... but for raids I was a guest player for hardcore raiding guild because they knew I could play my class ... I was good at my rotation so they could count at steady good dmg and no fuc* ups ...  now from time perspective I can tell there was still many things I could do better and improve my pve dmg ... soooooo unless you don't aim for best guilds in world you will do just fine in pve when you master pve rotation ... it's really not a rocket science ... if math doesn't scare you, you will understand hunter's rotation 
---
Summary: play hunter ... if played well hunter is a beast in pvp ... and use engineering ... it complements hunter in absurdly good way ... arguably hunter benefits from engineering the most from all classes (don't quote me on that because lot of ppl will kill me lolololol :P ) 
---
Cheers!!
---
What about raid frames for healing? :o
---
How so - I did Onyxia, ZG, MC and BWL in classic, I don't remember anything special - the attunements were fairly straightforward in BRS for MC and BWL
---
I started recruiting 2 months ago and now have a guild of 130+ with our own private server, music, dkp website and artwork but no official game to play. The hype is unreal!
---
Anyone got intel on x-perl and yaht? Very important.
---
Retadin is a huge meme. Only 'good' in undead 5mans, i.e scholo and strat.
---
Never tried one in naxx since you won't get a spot as ret in naxx.
---
The thing is, you need to sacrifice so much for MP5 on gear that you will do next to no damage. The only thing a ret is good for is when you level, and if you plan to not raid. They have okay burst if lucky and below shitty sustain.
---
Well, they give some pretty good shit. Recipes, blue gear, purple gear, I mean like I said you don't have to do it but by not doing it you're missing out on some cool stuff.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/)

May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

#Pertento#
---
**Alliance | RP-PvP | EU**
---
** *Semi-hardcore raiding with a social atmosphere* **
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
*Note: We will play on a RP-PvP realm if it's made available to us, if not we will opt for a PvP realm.*
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**What we provide:**
---
- An active, well-organised, and strictly toxic-free Discord.
---
- Experienced leaders; with a history of hardcore raiding and PvP in vanilla.
---
- The possibility for Socials and PvPers to thrive in the guild too, through social raids and BG premades.
---
- RP events in between raids for those interested (meaning less raid logging!).
---
- Community-driven members, with initiatives such as Vanilla Friends made possible by us.
---
- IRL meetups.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun + Monday (for progression) 20:00 - 24:00 CET

Of course you can level with a healing spec. It's just going to take a long time. But getting a spot in a dungeon group will be extremely easy.
---
you dont know what spell batching is. Its when 2 actions are launched simultaneously, they will both land on ennemy. This has nothing to do with front stab.
---
It's an objectively weak spec that brings essentially no utility that doesn't just come with the paladin class itself. There's a few content creators who keep trying to convince people that ret is actually pretty good, and they'll show you these cherrypicked video clips where they were tryharding and doing well on the meters on some MC farm raid where everyone else was half asleep and skimping on consumables.
---
Ret is actually fine in dungeons and I don't remember people really kicking them out of parties, though they might not be particularly eager to invite you. Noone's going to decline to join a dungeon run with a ret paladin in it, so you can always just start your own groups. That's gonna be the least of your concerns. Getting invited to raids and organized PvP is a different matter entirely. Most just won't do it.
---
The playstyle is very primitive. It's mostly just auto-attack, there are no attack skills for paladins. You don't have anything like Mortal Strike or Sinister Strike, you simply start swinging and manage your buffs. Damage output is low, itemization is awful, competes with warriors for gear, and there's simply no reason to bring a ret paladin to a raid unless there's such a shortage of holy paladins that you just need the extra blessing.
---
In PvP, ret is nothing special and has huge weaknesses like its total lack of mobility and ways to keep people in melee range. You can do some gimmicky stuff with Reckoning but it's just not that good. In recent dueling tournaments, special rules allow paladins to use Lay on Hands in every duel and they still aren't competitive. A good, well-geared ret who uses every possible trick can beat random shitlords, but that doesn't really mean anything.
---
All the other hybrid DPS specs have *something* going for them, even if it's a bit underpowered like moonkin aura or whatever. Ret paladins just don't. They have the same exact support kit as a holy paladin. If blessings had been limited to your group or only rets could judge seals, maybe the spec would have a place in the endgame. Unfortunately holy paladins can do all the same stuff.
---
you are grouping casual with easy.
---
those are 2 different things. By casual they are saying that if you can play less time you can enjoy it more. BFA fores you to do things on a daily basis with dailies and weekly. you have a checklist you are forced to do if you want to progress and you are pressured to do them to be able to play end game activities with everyone.
---
The contracts here is that in vanilla the game is not the end game. you are not pressured to reach level 60 as fast as possible, you can play at your own pace and you will always find people who play like you do. you are not missing out on 99% of the experience if you don't rush to 60 and play end game content, because the leveling alone gives you months of incredible fun and satisfaction.
---
That what they mean when they say vanilla is more causal. you can play however you want at whatever pace you want, without missing out on most of the game content.
---

Post is removed ?

Great work and thank you very much for making your code available on GitHub! :)
---
I found a couple of bugs but it's currently not allowed to contribute to your repository, so I opened a couple of bug reports for you. Keep up the good work.

&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
Who do we want?
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
What roles are in current demand?
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps mages/warriors and a good hunter at the moment
---
Misc:
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
How to join?
---
[https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK](https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK) , we are still in the process of setting up appropriate tabs. Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
But how about the argument that "the more you do a thing the better you become at it?" Doing the same BG 18 hours a day for at least four months, surely would make you a better pvo player, no ?
---
If you are really interested in pvp then go rogue.
---
Hunters are stronger but their pvp playstyle is not that enjoyable in my experience.
---
To be fair, that is 1-2 more buttons than most classes in raiding content
---
Warlock demonic sacrifices text looks wierd.
---
But anyway, good job!
---
Ok thank you mate :)
---
Question.
---
I will roll warrior (Human for minmax or Nelf just becouse i love 'em - dont know yet) . I will level with my colleagues from work and i plan on tanking dungeons along the way. Should i focus on Arms and just take a shield to dungeon or should i spec into prot while leveling?  I honestly thing talents dont really metter this early (meaning lvl 15+)
---
A guildie of mine on a very populated pserver just bought PoD off a party member for 19gold. He  sold it on the AH for 900g+ profit
---
Casual also correlates to easy. Casual people like easy games. Candy Crush, Fortnite. Not a high learning curve. 
---
And you're comparing two different situations. You're comparing someone who wants to progress in BfA to someone who doesn't want to progress in vanilla, In BfA, if you're not interested in progression raiding, you don't have to give a shit about doing those daily chores. You're mostly doing them because they're easy and as a casual gamer you probably like that content. If you want to do progression raiding in vanilla WoW, you're not going to be able to take your time to get to 60. There are many people doing practice runs on private servers right now because they want to get to 60 ASAP when Classic comes out and go hard in PvE / PvP.
---
If you're threat capped you can't do more damage anyway, so...
---
I would go ret man. While you’re leveling you can still heal groups you just need to be smart with itemization. If you get a cloth piece with +# healing keep it, and if you find a good healing sword and shield keep them. You can still heal as Ret and be good enough to keep group members up. There is no reason to level as holy. You get one super cheap talent respect and you should level to 60 then just roll what you want.

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild    
---
 **Introduction**   
---
 "Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
I felt the biggest diffefence appeared in aq and naxx. In mc and bwl it can be nice for squak and sappers on some cluster bosses, chrom, and nef. Same reason its good throughout the other raids.
---
But in AQ if you have enough sappers you can instantkill viscidious, and its nice shadow res for warlock tanking. In naxx the frost res trinkets are nice for the last 2 bosses, usually being efficient slots to switch before your frost res crafts
---
Usually the serious guilds do speedruns (every last bit of dps) and world bosses. Both places engineering shines with aoe stuns, sappers, and gadgets.
---
care to share your brush settings/brushes? like approximates are more than enough, i just can't seem to get around achieving anything like this.
---
ewww alliance PoV
---
No it didn't. Not how you think. It could only happen do to really bad latency which will not be a thing in modern classic.
---
Haha I don't live in England
---
&gt;What? Lookup curse or nihilum world first videos They used every buff available, even we used the buffs from the flowers in felwood I think it was
---
I love how they don't have Songflower in the video you linked.
---
Also getting world buffs was only a thing for the WF guilds at the very end of Naxx, even then they were hardly exhaustive about it. Group set up even in the WF video you linked also was not optimal.
---
I actually think it has taken a mental toll. Hanging out for classic means I'm not getting what I usually do from gaming, and I'm more stressed overall.
---
\-i wish they'd just make more good games instead.
---
Well, [this is what Illidan was infamous for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ).
---
I feel the same. I'm kinda playing just to get back in that 'vanilla mindset' of how the game worked, but I am playing a different faction/class than I will play on retail, just to make sure I don't ruin the experience when the game is out. Also taking advantage of this downtime to decide which addons to use, setting up UI, macros and stuff, so I don't have to waste time later.
---
He didn't reply to valv90, he replied to the guy you're talking about.
---
Yeet
---
You don't know what spell batching is.
---
It has nothing to do with a simultaneous keypress. There's a whopping 400ms timeframe to work with.
---
Spell batching may or may not play a role in frontstabbing.
---
Back then you could kick casts right at the end and it would still finish, but the other person would end on a lockout because he was still considered to be casting a spell.
---
Same applies for frontstabbing. 
---
But thanks for that shallow explanation of a mechanic I've abused for years already.
---
I would give it to a druid, or anybody who had been dedicated to the guild.
---
By the time you are able to complete it you are way past the point of "Needing" it for any class, same as hand of rag. It goes to the person who has been the most steadfastly loyal and helpful to the guild the guy who shows up every week, has consumes, is nice helpful and isn't toxic.
---
Please before working at a power plant, get some sleep ! We don't need another Chernobyl ! \^\^
---
My only game atm is Ultimate. I will still play it when doing long hours of Wow to not burn out. 3 hours wow 1 hour smash in an infinite loop.
---
I do not know, I tried to make a link to the published in the Russian-speaking sub-credit, but apparently it did not happen.
---
psst. &gt;!corecraft when!&lt;
---
I've got two shot by a t3 hunter last night as sm ruin warlock (basically t3 5k hp clothie without sl) on a private fun server. Like 2k+ multishot crit on me etc.
---
The demolishing clothies vibe is still there.
---
I think most people refer to raid damage when they say hunter's damage falls off late tier. I know nothing about that, so cant comment.:) But you seem like a pvp guy, who cares about dmg meters in raids anyways:)
---
Kargoz's guide on YouTube as a list of weapons you want to use at the e'd. It's incredibly useful.
---
Maybe time binning would have been a better name then spell batching.
---
2h's shouldn't be too hard, the rest of the dps gear will be awhile though.
---
Love these! Can't wait for silverpine/undercity/tirisfal
---
Have you heard of a game called league of legends?
---
That would be another 2 years of me telling the ignorant forum brigade that it would only make sense from a business perspective for Blizzard to create a classic realm of their own and that they would probably do exactly that, and yes, of course they have back up data from back then. 
---
No thanks! The wait's worth it.
---
"Addict.. playing in hours and not days"
---
Bye.
---
To be fair, it will be easy to get a group as ret since ull be healing anyway.
---
Fortunately I'm neither a mechanic nor an engineer in the control room haha..
---
Same situation.
---
Ypu cannot force "on crit" effects on yourself by sitting. Sit is a special state that slightly differs from a normal crit.
---
When I joined the sub we were making the posts on walls in caves.
---
t1 is basically BIS for a long time for hunters cause of the 8 set bonus, 15% multishot is no joke
---
Unfortunately Shagu has said pfUI is not coming to Classic WoW. [He posted this in the Discord.](https://imgur.com/RmBAJfV)
---
Casual
---
164 days. lel. I did play other games at the same time too, I'm an addict just like you. Why don't you count my time? This was my gaming prime:(
---
Vanilla is shit .
---
I think so, if they introducing sharding - most of the tough herbalism is in the starting zones
---
Text version in the video descriptions!
---
I provided your feedback as bug reports within the GitHub project. But you earned the Kudos for pointing these out ;)
---
You lost me at hours. Counting in hours feels casual even tho you played a shitload of hours.
---
I'm still proud if you.
---
I really enjoyed this. I would frequently go around defending different locations from attacks. Was great fun and made some good friends that way.
---
I’d argue mid-Wrath. Wrath started it early but it was felt for me around Coloseum. Beat the boss? Do it again and this time he’a blue with more damage, or do it again with your hand tied (10man hard) etc. Massive reuse of content to get everyone enjoy the game. And catch up mechanics en-Masse, tokens instead of drops (though that was already in BC). LFG. Little pre-quests for dungeons if any and story that didn’t have a proper direction.
---
To each their own taste I suppose.  
---
Personally I think that this is the best looking staff in the whole game. All those big flashy and fancy staffs of the recent expansions, ough, no one would be able to wield them.
---
IMO in phase 1 the top guild will have to gear up quickly and farm gold thus not having much time to farm for their consumables, I'd say going herb/alchi and sell the pots is the way to go if you want to make money via the AH
---
You can, but it’d just be to improve your stats. Druid’s attack power isn’t affected by their weapon’s damage, but by which form they are in. So you could technically keep it on. I think it has like 15 agi on it so it’s not the worst.
---
Thanks mate, maybe I've grown to become a casual. I'll get right back at it. Sorry.
---
*PS 
---
I've played on private servers on and off since I stopped playing retail when Cata destroyed my world.
---
It better release before november
---
I'm a supporter if it has no impact. But even then, so what if it did? Is anything you said a hindrance?
---
YouTube was a mistake
---
Please no. ^^^^please ^^^^yes
---
Nice Talent Planner, perfect for planning for leveling!
---
Here is a bug I found:
---
Gouge is a 3/3 talent, in your planner it can go up to 5, although the tooltip does not reduce the CD on Gouge beyond the 1,5 secs at 3/3
---
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
---
It's funny that it's getting downvoted so much :D  
---
Because every guild that just knows a tiny little bit about the game will give this to warriors and not rogues, as much as they'd like to have it. The amount of damage gain by giving it to a Warrior Tank is just tenfold...
---
A@@@@@@@@n
---
WoW was designed from the outset to pander to casuals. It was vastly more casual than the other offerings in the MMO market at the time. 
---
I don't like the direction that WoW has taken over the years and I absolutely understand that by comparison to the modern MMO market, Classic is a more hardcore experience than most games out there, but WoW was always a casual focused game.
---
The threat generation is insane with it.
---
We all agree that hunters shouldn’t get it 😂
---
Definitely not. I'm currently playing on a private server which will shut down when Classic releases. This means that I actually have a place to game before Classic releases and it also means it's a bad idea to waste time on an alt because everything will be gone in a few months, so I can just relax, enjoy Naxxramas and our recent C'thun kill. If they suddenly announced it a month before release not only would it fuck over most people on team private server, but it would also not leave room for all the feedback that Blizzard has listened to and reacted to with mostly positive results.
---
I'm going warrior and targeting three of them.
---
Arcane Power can only be chosen if you have only one point in Arcane stability, and you can't remove talents from lower tiers even if you have the points spent to do so.
---
On Pserver you need to delete your WDB folder when they upgrade the gear for it to appear in is current stage (the tooltips shows it as green even tho it is now blue).
---
I was helping a mage farming the arena and it dropped, I clicked need because I was taking all the shit stuff to desenchant and I forgot to delete my WDB...
---
Long story short, I got a shitstorm of insult
---
I absolutely hated the game back then haha. I was balls deep into competitive broodwar and WoW seemed like such a chore. Oddly enough it wasn't until Nost that I truly fell in love with vanilla, or WoW at all.
---
Not really. It caused me to jump onto a private server and start trying classes out. I am excited for the proper release but have been able to test the game out in the past months.
---
Are you really asking if giving pvp advantages is a hindrance?
---
90% of people won’t have these so i’d suggest to choose a class for its flavours rather than its legendary weapon
---
Black market AH was in vanilla, and will definetily be in classic.
---
I really hope we will get a mod developer who will prepare quest checker. What I mean by that is mod that checks all quests in region, map, world and tells you the amount of quests you have completed, that left, gives you coordinates where to start them. I really want to do all possible quests in the game =)
---
Tokens are in the new expansion, and you can use them to buy game time. Game time = classic game time.
---
Nothing more than that.
---
Nice joke mate, im addicted to researching stuff for classic and watching videos for classic already.
---
Theres gonna be so many people selling items in raids
---
The extreme hype train I put myself on is actually fizzling out and now I'm stuck in a mood where I'm not even sure I want to play classic anymore lol
---
Activision-Blizzard Dennis Durkin included Classic in the Q2 financial report
---
So maybe it's gonna be sooner than expected
---
PvP advantages? You can't be serious. This is so insignificant. As if everyone here doesn't know if someone is casting or who's holding a flag.
---
That's what I mean.
---
It's not about the Warrior dealing a bit more damage. He sure does. But: the additional threat allows every single DPS in the raid to deal more damage. Specifically on AoE Threat situations the procc allows for so much faster clear times. 
---
For single target it doesn't really matter. The guilds that go for super TPS will use a Druid in the case of high TPS requirements for single target either way.
---
Incredible stuff. Too bad my guild chose to be horde :(
---
I was JUST talking about this with my friend, he wants me to play new games with him and im just "meh" :(
---
The wait is killing me but moreso i just dont feel excited about any other games now :(
---
Why did they end Shaman tanking?
---
Was it because Enhancement became a PvP one shot windfury spec?
---

---
Intro: 
---
Awake is a newly formed guild that aims to provide a space for those who can not live the life of a 9-5 guild because of their everyday lives but still want to play dungeons, PvP and especially raids.
---
Goals: 
---
- Building a nocturnal community (including socials!)
---
- Setting up a Raid in the first 1 to 2 months
---
- Despite limited time (planned are 2 raiding days for 40s) to be a top guild of the server
---
- But most important: to have fun together!
---
Expectations:
---
 From our socials: Be nice :)
---
 From our raiders:
---
- You know your class and all the mechanics of the current Raid
---
- You prepare yourself with consumables
---
- You enchant your gear
---
- You are able to take criticism
---
- You aim to have a high raid participation
---
We offer: 
---
- An experienced guild leader that is active in WoW since 2005 in both casual and hardcore settings
---
- Open officer positions for those that are active, experienced and want to help others
---
Raid Info: 
---
- Raid times and days aren't final yet but we will start around 11PM / Midnight and do 3,5 hours
---
- 2 days per week for 40 raids, 20 raids spontaneously on offdays
---
- Loot assignment isn't fixed yet.
---
To join us come to our discord http://discord.gg/ffDRTn7
---
Sorry dude but no, filling your bags with arrows or soul shards is a fucking chore. There’s nothing hard about it. 
---
This game isn’t difficult. At all. If it was, arena players would be recognized names in esport, as well as players who compete for world firsts. Truth is they barely register within the game itself. 
---
You just want the thing you like to be objectively better than what someone else likes. You aren’t special for wanting to play classic wow, and there’s nothing wrong, worse or bad about people who won’t enjoy it either. Just because there’s what I assume are hours of content readily available in retail (I assume, I haven’t touched it since tbc), and players can actually access that content, does not make someone who plays ten hours of retail any more or less ‘casual’ than someone who spends the same time in vanilla/classic. 
---
That’s the argument you are presenting, and it’s bullshit.
---
Hey man that sounds radAF, i have an oculus instalation at my place with a sall room dedicated for it. And the idea to play wow on it is more than intriguing. Could you give more details on fow do you run this and your personal advices ?
---
Thanks a lot
---
You can also grab the intellect buff, interrupt reduction and Consecrate in the holy tree then continue in ret. That way you can tank, heal and dps in dungeons. I'd suggest picking up engineering as well because it's such a useful profession for both PvP and PvE. Especially since paladins have no gap closer or pull ability. Rocket boots and grenades work nicely for that.
---
no. go deep ret for leveling.
---
Oops. That's where my copy pasting went wrong. Check back in two months and tell me if it's still broken.
---
I'll be taking an extended break from my retail mythic guild.
---
Lol pvp titles would like a word.
---
Yeah my bad, it wasn't even me confusing the aesthetics! Since both zones start with "D" I just....mixed the names. All D's look the same to me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
For real? I was trying out a mage (gonna be my main in classic) and was AOEing some wolves....And those guys appeared! Scared me shitless.
---
wow incredible, we need MORE.  i LOVE the undead lore and theme of warcraft so i cant wait to see the undercity!

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in both organized &amp; random Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally created in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest corners of the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over the years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the Burning Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of the world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination for all your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events taking place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however that concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will often spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
I would advise everyone to pick engineering. It adds 5-6 if not more new abilities that non-engineers can't get and that's pretty amazing. Doesn't matter if you PvP or PvE, the profession is so damn useful I would just have it by default on every character.
---
I’m levelling my mage main with friends, so my priest or rogue alt will be pretty close due to jobs etc. I’m so keen for classic!!
---
GLAMORAMA (Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!
---
Classic is coming! We are already over 80 people but still recruiting - almost full on mages and priests but we will still consider a good application 
---
Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to clear all raid content, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
Our background:
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
What we offer:
---
•	⁠     Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and 
---
     Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
•	⁠     Knowledgeable and experienced raid 
---
     leading
---
•	⁠     Balanced raid groups
---
•	⁠     For those interested we will run 20- 
---
     man PVE and PVP content on other 
---
      days
---
What we require of raiders:
---
•	⁠     Average attendance 1.5 times/week 
---
      40-man raids
---
•	⁠     Suitable PVE spec, consumables and 
---
      knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We strongly believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be “geared and cleared” of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
Loot rules: We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing
---
We look forward to your application. Contact us on discord https://discord.gg/92V5CCD , send us a message or comment in the thread if you have any questions.
---
Sincerely,
---
Glamorama
---
I only started playing the week leading up to BC release and If I recall correctly, I never saw Atiesh on my server but I saw all the other three at least a few times. 
---
I think someone said that Atiesh required too much work and came out too close to BC release so no one got it.
---
i'm with this guy.  if you're this good at something, be a fucking chad about it because you deserve it
---
You're confusing casuals with entitled players. Casual (to me) means you just play casually, without too much time investment.
---
My point is that in Classic you can get a fulfilling few hours of gameplay and be done for the week, where in BfA I don't think you can. If you don't put in the time, you're just stranded doing meaningless content with faceless nobodies.
---
I just wanna know WHEN its coming out so I can plan. That's all, just give me a date..
---
Omg I'm blind ahah ! thanks very much man will definitly follow it =)
---
my whole point flew right by you man :P
---
Leatherworkers had specializations back then, dragonscale was for crafting mail. On curren WoW you can craft everything.
---
You may be absolutely correct but you are making an assumption. There is no blue post and it is all a guessing game. Do you have the original Vanilla core to verify this? Only Blizz does- downvote me to oblivion if you want, doesn't change the fact that using dated website info isn't concrete evidence to prove your point
---
Yeah because end of dreams exists i dont see a reason for druid to get it if you are in the min max mindset
---
It will be like in retail. Some Hardcore guilds will go alliance, semihardcore players will go alliance for bigger Chance of joining a Hardcore guild.
---
And this way one side will slowly build a bigger scene and even ppl who dont care about raiding will have the perception of "one side is better"
---
I would say viable in a mediocre guild and meme in a good guild. I've seen rets tear up the meters in average guilds, then join a better guild and fall behind. It's very easy to dps as ret and it's very safe so you can pull a lot of tricks. They also do scale fairly well in early content, but just like the hunters and ferals they fall significantly behind in AQ and Naxx. 
---
Rets are really good wielders of Nightfall though because they get double proc rates on their attacks. This might only be a quirk of the private servers though... Our ret sometimes switches over to healing if needed and he heals fairly well considering he has few holy talents.
---
The only  addon I really care about is the ***original*** killing blow announcer with sounds from UT 2004. Cannot recall the name unfortunately.
---
(Not talking about the current Weakauras workaround. It was a fully dedicated addon just for that.)
---
I love typing and reading gamechat. I hate switching to and engaging with out of game programs just to play a game. As for audio, I want to hear the game world and the music, not someone breathing into a mic or telling unfunny story after story.
---
I hear Horde racials are more wanted in PVP though. So maybe that will tip the scale on the other side to a degree.
---
What has Overwatch to do with wow classic?
---
The reason this is good is because 25% plays a warrior yet follow guides made for hunters, meaning they get routinely rekt or follow horribly inefficient routes.
---
Don’t forget that warlock tanks were a thing for a few bosses like Twin Emperors. And Soul Shards.
---
I did- and that is literally one archived site that could have been easily edited by anyone. I'm in the side assuming it wont work too- which apparently people didnt read either. Assuming that you are absolutely correct based off of outdated info doesnt make you right- and neither does it make me right. 
---
All I have said was we will see when it goes live. If I were to drudge up se random website for "facts" without concrete evidence beyond that in a court of law it wouldnt hold up. But apparently to Warcraft fans it does.
---
Yea minmaxing wise Horde racials are better for pvp. Only thing is the alliance got a mini advantage in battlegrounds due to map design ( AV! )
---
There's a big difference in trying to spot a dark blue or dark red flag and a big bright pink flag. And if you can change model sizes that's an obvious advantage. 
---
Some spells in vanilla had the same color/animation and look either identical or almost identical. You can definitely trick someone into interrupting a certain spell, but if we had new animations then someone could more easily tell what spell they're casting and know whether to interrupt or not rather than just guessing or at least have a faster reaction.
---
Unless people play with lag switches.
---
Any addon that didn't exist in vanilla or on private server will get down voted to oblivion by the private server crowd.
---
Tailoring, yes. The others not so much. Atleast in my experience.
---

Original blue post, there you go Mr Facts
---
I have a limited amount of time to play the game and I do not enjoy playing half of my 40-60s in the black and white zone, trying to find my corpse just because a rogue has fun killing players way below his level. That being said I suppose it's obvious: I'll be playing on a PvE server.
---
Truth be told: until we see the servers going live and feeling how many players will be playing at any given time, no single person will be able to tell you how noticeable it is going to be playing on a PvP Server. Back in the days I played on a PvP Server and I was "just fine". Stranglethorn was always an issue but all of the other zones were pretty simple to maneuver through. At least this way you've been able to kill those players of the other faction going for your ores and herbs and whatnot. 
---
"Honorable open PvP" used to be fun, always. It would certainly be fun again. But truth is that It's NO fun being ganked by a squad of 3+ multiple times just for their amusement. And that's why I won't even be risking it this time around. PvP is fine in the battlegrounds, that's all the PvP fun I can cope with.
---
The beauty of vanilla was the creativity that came from the community developing addons and embracing the good ones. 
---
All addons deserve to exist, it's up to the players if they use them or not.
---
My plans over the summer are to convert the unfinished area above my garage to make a YouTube studio/editing workstation/streamer HQ, a few pieces of your work would look amazing hanging on the wall of my finished space.  Do you contract any of your work?
---
What a lot of people don't realize is that it's highly possible that "hamstring kiting" won't work.
---
It is not "viable" but it is playable if you can live with the harassment and shunning. Just expect a metric ton of resistance as you will A. Do less damage than a pure dps class and B. are a paladin which is one of the best healers in the game so people will naturally want you to do that.
---
I feel you. M+ is great for a challange but it litterly split the communitie in thousand pieces.
---
The +2 playerbase does not get invited into the +5 playerbase. Same goes for +10, +12, +14 etc.
---
You have to work up from the level you are in. You dont waste time in dungeons 2 levels lower than you normaly do and dont get invited in 2 higher than you are used to do.
---
The m+ scene is a diffrent game on its own.
---
Looks like ElvUI is planned for Classic, pfUI is based on that so it's all good.
---
I'm still almost certain it's not relevant for fronstabbing, which takes advantage of poor server tickrates as well as latency to servers.  
---
Assuming you're playing on a local official server, you won't be able to frontstab without deliberately breaking your connection, which I hope will be bannable as an exploit
---
I remember I was downvoted on /r/wow once when I pointed out the change from stats to literally a single number on the character screen as if it was the only thing that mattered judging by its size and being at the top of the panel. 
---
Retail players have zero self awareness about how the game is tailored to the lowest IQ players.
---
Not bis, not crap.
---
JustVanillaThings, 
---
just like we love it.
---
You have an addiction problem. Your life is wasting away.
---
Good to see that WeakAuras is planned for Classic. It's a great and versatile addon.
---
It might work, I hope it works at least.
---
But why would you pick it on a fresh server with no money? As an alt? Yeah. But don't you need money first and then get it?
---
Hi Andrew. I am also an addict. All this watered down and cut with baby powder that is live wow just wasn't keeping me high enough. I'm planning on taking two weeks of vacation at launch to no life it to 60 and maybe I will OD, who knows.
---
Isn't the start of the decline when tier sets had their stats adjusted? I always liked having a variety of stats and having to think about what works. Makes me sad that we are using version 1.12 items
---
Streams are encoded too
---
Me a bit.   I got bored yesterday, re-subbed and it was just boring.   After 3 hrs, I had only two people talk to me.
---
I decided to make a new toon, to explore the level oath I want to take during classic.   Full heirloom.  I wasn't paying attention and got in combat with a LVL 10 mob.   My LVL 1 ass beat him easy.
---
I logged off.
---
As viable as polearms
---
This is a great point, I remember playing 12 hours a day as a warrior, if this was a real thing then someone would have noticed it and people would have been doing it. We had millions of players and classic lasted for years. Someone would have noticed
---
Well we can go off the classic wow demo. 
---
Classic textures
---
Up to date client from legion and bfa
---
Water and shadows have been improved with the option to go down to classic textures (I love classic water)
---
There is no view distance slider as it would break the old world which wasn't an actual fully 3d realized continuous world until cata.
---
Just saw one yesterday. I also began at the starting zone and adventured on for a long time. I was a warrior and I had a pretty neat party with me too! Probably a side effect of having played 10 years of WoW :)
---
But on the flip side, getting quests done will be super annoying.
---
Found out in late feb :D
---
Get Dat r14 boi
---
They already improved the shadows and water. Be happy.
---
AQ40 mace has 280AP for druids, so definitely worth swapping after using the effect.
---
So no changes but still changes?
---
Retail players don't normally use a World channel. At least not on any of the servers I've ever played on.
---
No engineering is one of the cheapest professions to level and making money from crafting in vanilla is really hard. Especially since much more people rely on guildies crafting for them than back in vanilla. Now we know where to get all the recipes and we usually stack the expensive ones on a dedicated guildie. So you have that one enchanter per guild who has everything and can make a ton of gold by just spamming trade, meanwhile every other enchanter only has the green enchants which are not worth anything. Same with the other professions. You make far more gold from gathering professions, especially herbalism.
---
Haha yeah sounds like it might be better. :)

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**
---
Feel free to ask questions in the comments or come and join our Discord - https://discord.gg/JDHrnU3

Inefficiency for the sole sake of topping healing meters is a sign of a not great raiding environment. Flash heal is hugely less efficient for priests. Shamans by and large use chain heal which is a 2.5 second cast. Paladins using flash of light spam are the exception to 2.5 second heals, not the rule.
---
Even still, 1.5 second casts makes mp5 even more valuable than +healing meaning whipvine is even better itemized if you're spamming inefficient 1.5 second heals.
---
Whipvine is barely worse than t3 priest belt and is truly beat outright by only C'thun belt.
---
Compare that to available caster belts who end up with plenty of better or comparable items depending on where the caster is on the hit curve. Mana igniting is better in almost all cases, doubly true for mages. Tier 2 warlock belt is sick and the aforementioned Firemaw's Clutch is a pretty big chunk of spell power better (and always going to casters before being a minuscule for priests in a guild worth anything). Hell even the ZG blue boss drop Belt of Untapped Power or MC Sash of Whispered Secrets is better than Ban'thok in some situations, mainly for mage or shadow priest respectively. If you're especially hit starved Angelista's grasp is even an option trading 12 spell power for another hit and stats. You could even grind out honored AB and get a comparable belt there trading one hit for a crit and some spell power. That's just through BWL.
---
I never understood the "which faction" question. When the game loads up, you pick horde, and most of the game is spent killing NPC's mostly from the "Alliance" which is more or less as much a faction as "beasts/humanoids/dragonkin"
---
Yes, he should probably focus on running dungeons and doing dungeon quests.
---
Do you have a source for that info? I would be super interested to see it :D
---
Tokens were introduced in AQ40
---
Been following it since Nost shut down 😬when are we going to get a release date ffs
---
I'm rolling Horde, so yeah I'm concerned. The hardcore meta nowadays is to play Alliance, and private servers have become more and more skewed in that direction. On the recent major vanilla server you couldn't really go anywhere as Horde without running through massive gank squads at every popular chokepoint.
---
**&lt;Addicted&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Semi-hardcore PvP/Raiding Guild - English**
---
**Introduction**
---
Addicted is a serious but friendly guild which is looking for outstanding players in order to rush the content when the game comes out. We will both rush PvE and PvP content.
---
We are also looking for socials/non-raiders, there will definitely be raids for alts
---
**Goals**
---
* Have the first 60s of the server among our members
---
* Be the first guild of the server to clear the PvE content
---
* Manage the PvP ranking of our server when PvP comes out (in order to have the most R13/14)
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* Must be very familiar to the game
---
* Strong PvE and/or PvP knowledge
---
* Team member, friendly attitude and not being a pretentious asshole :)
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
At start 2 to 3 raid days, later reduce that to 1 to 2 days when content is on farm/speedrun. The days are not defined yet but will be discussed together with the members.
---
If you are interested or have any questions please contact me on Discord : Dexedrine#2775 or Vicodine#4176

Isn't dueling to test your PvP skills? And aren't there some match ups that are heavily favoured on one side? If you're playing the unfavoured side wouldn't you want to know if you can win that fight with consumables to know if using those consumables is worthwhile in world PvP?
---
The first one goes to a mage, but once one mage has it for the aura there are better weapons for the rest of the mages. Then warlocks/priests can get the rest (if you somehow manage to get multiple ones in a guild). But once you're at the point of getting an Atiesh you don't really care about who gets it, and i would say you should give it to the most dedicated player that can use it.
---
They’re all awful for a shadow priest.
---
So what do you make of the years of whining on the forums that the game has become so much more handholding? Welfare epics? Would you deny that getting an epic in current WoW is less meaningful than in vanilla?
---
The game has become so much easier over the years, and yes requiring ammo and soul shards does contribute to that. It’s not just a matter of convenience, it also removed a layer of difficulty. You denying that is bullshit.
---
You realize the amount gold in the economy doesn't change with the token system?
---
People will buy gold with dollars with or without the token system.
---
Damn this is really well done! I'll definitely use this guide.
---
Gotcha!
---
So long as they have a pointy end to stick them with.   It's all good.
---
Indeed. That's what we in the industry call "A Downside"
---
Hell yeah, my dad played it all the time but I was only old enough to really know what was happening during the WoTLK days, but he quit right after Wrath ended. Sad time :(
---
But I don’t think that content is meaningless to casuals. To casuals that IS the content. There’s no greater goal.
---
Casual is not just about time investment. You can’t tell me that someone who plays Candy Crush 20 hours a week is a more hardcore gamer than someone who plays Dark Souls 10 hours a week.
---
[deleted]
---
That's true, but that will be a pretty difficult method to level compared to just playing ret and questing imo.
---
Most responses to posts on this sub have been mostly negative recently. I should have seen it coming tbh
---
At the moment. He's trying to make it so that it does.
---
Not many good alternatives early game. I don't think you'll get your hands on any T1 as a shadowpriest though. The D1 set provides some decent stats although the spirit is not so useful.
---
"Release date any day now" - Says increasingly nervous man for the sixth time this week
---
I don't think Naxx is going to be on farm in the way you think it will be. Like, if it we're retail, yeah, totally. But the progression curve in Vanilla and the requirements for gear and consumables is such a large curve that I think Naxx in Classic is going to be something only a minority of players will ever step into, let alone clear.
---
It will probably have more people clear it than did back in the early 2000's given how much game knowledge has increased. But man, I just don't see it for a while.
---
&gt; it honestly seems on schedule right now.  
---
What could you possibly base that on?
---
Yes,but it’s because I find wpvp to be more fun when you have a more even faction ratio.
---
I’m going Horde myself though.
---
I'm saying Whipvine as a blue prebis item for healers is a better item than Ban'thok is as blue prebis item for casters.
---
I've had troubles in the past with quiting League as there was something that lured me in every damn time. After being 8/1 up and not being able to carry my deadweight team (that one game) something clicked. The game is just a coinflip on teammates / enemy team. You're gambling most of the time while time passes.
---
It is not worth the stress and I'm so glad I made the decision to quit.
---
Ah, the ol' laptop rig for bathroom breaks. You're a hero.
---
But trolls also have beastslaying, regeneration, and throwing specialisation. Not a single wasted racial for rogues. 
---
Where as orcs have pet damage and axe specialisation.
---
I'm not going to pass up a Horde without elves.
---
Sometimes, I go on my steam library and play games that I bought and never played. Then when it does not fill the void fro classic, I stop playing a buy something new. Each time I do this, I cry a little on the inside. I keep telling myself to hold on, that a release date is soon. I just can't help but feel like I will end up like the specter in infinity war. Floating around in front of the blizzard buildings, guiding others to a treasure I may never loot. 
---
Please send help!
---
I was Alliance last time but planning on going Horde this time around simply because I want to play Shaman so have little choice in the matter
---
iiinteresting. What would you use over it, considering that Helm of Awareness is dire maul and Enchanted Thorium Helmet was added in 1.4?
---
Try a private server maybe? Or you don't like to waste your time hehe.
---
you deleting your post and reposting, in the hope of getting more reactions... smh
---
That part really grinds my gears.
---
Private server?
---
The beauty of vanilla was THE community. Simple as that. The problem with simming (at least in retail) is that you are constantly being pushed to perform at your characters max (warcraftlogs is espacially guilty of this).
---
If you don't perform, you simply get kicked. (ofc you have to perform in vanilla too, but it's way more forgiving)
---
I can't imagine simming being that important either cause one button rotations lol.
---
Texture/model replacement has always been a bannable offense since it being used for the AQ40 exploit. Having the option for updated graphics has nothing to do with this.
---
And for spells, key phrase is "more easily" which means squat since it's already easy with the addition of a single addon. Any PvPer worth their salt knows enemy castbar. 
---
If those are your only arguments then just allow others to enjoy the option, which doesn't affect you or the game in any way shape or form.
---
Wtf shit socks? That ain't right.
---
It’s more appealing because it has more depth in all its aspects, it’s really the little things like requiring reagents to start a campfire, weapon skills, being able to fail at gathering a node, whatever.
---
Having to group with people to do quests now and then, almost everything is better if you just grab someone in the same area along and play with them. 
---
It feels like a game, you progress with each step, while retail feels like candy crush or whatever else you mentioned, and it’s fun to play a game that isn’t constantly trying to keep you at it at all costs. Retail has more of these things that were originally designed to make mobile games appealing to children, like the constant spam of flashy popups. I guess that’s good to keep people playing, not very good to keep people actually enjoying the gameplay.
---
I didn't want to make the intro video too long, but as the choices to respec, and choose the quest reward come up, I do indicate the alternatives of staying arms or going slam spec with that staff. 
---
The kill speeds with all three methods are viable to get you over the finish line and just vary in their pros and cons. I preferred dual wield because I felt it benefited more from the felwood flower buff we get access to after level 53, and also after 50 levels I get straight up tired of hamstring kiting. :P
---
I’m wondering how impactful berserking is dps wise. I wanna play an orc hunter, but I am curious if it made any significant difference in dps if I played troll.
---
At the same time most gaming and game design in general is centered around a similar reward or risk based scenario. It could all be deemed psych manipulation if you tried. Where do you draw the line?  Even classic wow had it's people that would become addicted to the point of self harm all from a game.
---
Without the /sit enrage thing arms seems alot better. I have levelled 3 warriors 1-40 recently to test some things and arms just feels better due to the imp overpower synergy with deep wounds(?).
---
My fastest levelling warrior was actually dw arms to get more dodges, therefore more overpowers, and more deep wounds.
---
That was also the last one I levelled but arms definitely seems better
---
just press no
---
And what exactly do you think this post is?
---
Does anyone have an idea as to how long theyll have between these phases or is everyone just assuming itl be a couple of months/even done manually depending on how many people have completed the raids?
---
The post is different, Thomas. Don't worry bud, you look great!
---
Basically any instance with a 'door' before the portal.
---
Dire Maul and strat comes to mind.
---
Is there such a thing as a gear planner?
---
your title is different, but same picture.
---
Why wouldn’t that work? It’s a skill that slows movement speed. That’s like saying frost bolt won’t slow mobs.
---
7 hour raid nights, man. You do what you gotta.
---
This is close to my reality as well, we are brothers in arms.
---
They are getting sold currently on private servers. Also it doesn't matter, because pugs will have the +1 loot system, so you can't just win everything and sell it off.
---
a shit post...
---
Because they like to think they know the clever tricks to level not remember what vanilla wow had or they never even played it. I remember playing a rogue and specifically trying as hard as possible to get backstabs without gouge and it never worked.

BfA baby spotted.
---
The problem with hAmStRiNg KiTe is about 50% of mobs have something that stops it working properly.
---
A slow, a ranged, a gap closer, a fast movement speed. Also the lack of being hit means you generate rage so slowly that it’s actually better to fight mobs normally and eat/ bandage when needed.
---
Casual, absolutely. If nothing else you provide utility and tranquility totem for the mage group. Your going to need to farm a ton of mana pots and demonic runes though seeing as mana is by far the biggest issue.
---
For MC, I don't see why Casuals wouldn't accept an Elemental. But those spots will be gone very quickly, so look for a Casual raid ASAP.
---
In the official Webside, 1 Casual Raid has all the Moonkins and Ele Shamans already stacked out and are only looking now for normal Warrior and Rogue DDs. (Can you imagine that) 
---
If you don't find anything for a pure Ele, you will find something for the Ele/Resto in a Casual Raid for sure.
---
Dont really understand why this is funny?
---
Top end damage is more important than dps. Bonebiter vs mograines 2h mace. Mace actually has more dps but bonebiter does waaaaaay more damage due to ~30 more top end.  
---
Spirit is great if you stack it
---
Stick to meth, memes are not your thing.
---
&gt; The problem with simming (at least in retail) is that you are constantly being pushed to perform at your characters max (warcraftlogs is espacially guilty of this).
---
It's very much like that on private servers already, all you need is DPS meters, inspect people and check their consumables. They even developed addons to make sure everyone used full consumables and use it even if the content is pushover easy.
---
I'm sure Classic will be a lot more elitist than vanilla ever was but simming isn't required for that, the gearing path for every class is already theorycrafted and set in stone.
---
Yeah, what he said.
---
Same thing with idiots saying hardiness &gt; wotf,
---
Laughable
---
Given that a few stages are handed in at ratchet, xroads works fine too.
---
When I joined the sub we were all just a bunch of amoeba squirming together waiting for a Classic release date.
---
Can you link to that? Because in their Activision Blizzard Earnings Call
---
they said Classic will release in 2nd half of this year.
---
**Experienced raider LF Semi-to-Hardcore Raiding Community**

As you can tell, I am looking for a good fit.  The more established the community, the better.  The more WoW experience (especially Vanilla), the better.  The more mature, the better.  The more balanced between raiding and socialization, the better.  
---
I played WoW from Beta until just before Warlords, completing most raids (missing only Vanilla Naxx, Hyjal, Sunwell, and Ulduar).  While my vanilla experience was as a SM/Ruin Warlock, I have played Ret Paladin since BC.  I am keenly interested in raiding as Ret in Vanilla, even if it is not fully optimal.  However, I would be open to playing Warlock again in the right community.  
---
PM me here or on Discord (ZacHFX#8127).
---
I started in mid 2008, but never got to 70 before WotLK. WotLK was the first time I experienced proper end game stuff.
---
I played pretty much daily for all of WotLK and about half of Cataclysm. Came back for MoP, played about 2 months but never did any end game stuff, came back at the end for the level 90 boost and Timeless Isle stuff. Played basically zero WoD, never got to max level. Once again came back at the end to level up with invasions. Rushed to 110 in Legion and quit pretty much straight away. Played BfA for about 3 weeks and quit.
---
I basically haven't done any end game PvE since Lich King. I've never stepped foot into an LFR raid either, for example. I always enjoyed just doing low level stuff and achievements.
---
haha yeah, being 15 was great
---
its EU-Frostwolf (DAS BOOT IST VOLL!)
---
no need for people to know my name
---
Tokens existed since Vanilla. The ZG set was token based.
---
Amen! I feel exactly the same and cannot wait for Classic to bring back the good old community.
---
However, the community changed over the years. The 14-year old player from 2005 is not comparable to the 14-year old Fortnite-flossing player of 2019.

What I see in current retail is that half of the time you group up with strangers through dungeon finder, if you write "Hi" in chat, thre's a "funny" kid replying with "Fuck off" or shit like that, and I am afraid there is no cure to this social cancer.
---
I am glad that, so far, statistics showed that the most interest in Classic comes from players in the 25-35 range, therefore there should be a more socially mature core compared to BfA.
---
Everything in vanilla has been simed to death already, this add-on will change nothing
---
Alliance is the PvE/RP faction.
---
Horde is the PvP / HC PvE faction.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
took me solid 20 minutes to find out where my mounts have gone. I guess you're right, its not like if heard good things about BfA but after years I decided to check it out myself. Seeing people on flying tigers just feels so wrong
---
LFG AU QLD time
---
PVP
---
Undecided 
---
Lots and often
---
Raiding, social
---
Nope, ZG was the first token set.
---
What were the stats before that?
---
Cant wait for the return of a world, in my world of warcraft.
---
There is a great 2h axe reward from a quest in rfc, look it up!
---
Do horde 👍
---
yeah whatever
---
First of all he doesn't even have most world buffs and doesnt even use the right flask.
---
Secondly this is a world first guild, it's like showing that guild who cleared BWL in 18 mins and saying everyone on pservers playslike that.
---
I'm going to be rolling a paladin. Join me.
---
Thanks Obama!
---
well pve wise you benefit way more from pallies than shaman, pvp is much more nuanced and you can make a case for either
---
Well aren't you wearing the big boy pants.
---
And fear ward.
---
Even earlier which was my point that tokens are totally vanilla
---
i'm not reading it because he's talking about rigid boxes when i'm trying to talk about a totally dynamic ratio. i'm literally displaying investment:return at work by not reading his post.

**&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance**
---
**Introduction:**
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
**Looking For:**
---
```
---
    Damage:
---
     -  Hunter
---
     -  Warlock
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Rogue
---
    Healing:
---
     -  Priest
---
     -  Paladin
---
     -  Druid
---
    Tanking:
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be.
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.
---

👌
---
stats don't work like they do in retail, int gives a tiny amount of crit and mana pool that's it. For spriest you want hit spell damage and then raw stats for pvp
---
You'll be pretty popular for your food and portals, too.
---
Cause we get flooded by the so called experts who drowns us in videos with outdated pirate server info.
---
**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server - Early Weeknight Raids!**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are actively looking for all classes and roles, so now is the opportunity to join at the ground level and help build something special.  There are open leadership positions available for qualified individuals.
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Tank, Feral DPS, Heal)
---
* Hunter (BM, Mark)
---
* Mage (All Specs)
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Priest (Heal)
---
* Rogue (All Specs)
---
* Warlock (All Specs)
---
* Warrior (Tank, DPS)
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

You can PvP very well with that (as elemental), but can still do some healing in raids. Nature swiftness can be used both defensively (on heals) as well as offensively (on nature damaging spells.
---
As soon as phase 2 hits I will respec to 30 0 21. My plan is to heal in raids with my healing gear. Hopefully I have aquired some decenet pvp gear (mostly mail, with decent stam and maybe some spellpower/crit) at this time so I can pvp and grind with elemental. 
---
Hopefully my guild has progressed enough of MC/Ony for this to not be to problematic.
---
No fun allowed, don't you even consider it.
---
You're in for an absolute blast mate. 
---
I didn't play back then (started in WOTLK) but 3 years ago out of complete boredom I decided to download a certain popular Pserver starting with an N. I had no intention of playing the game for more than an hour, I just wanted to run about for a bit, complete some quests, re visit the old troll questing island off the coast of Durotar that I remembered from Wrath as it was removed in Cata and just get a general feel for how the old game looked and felt. 
---
1 year and half later I had been completely sucked in rocking a level 60 warrior, 60 hunter and 40 mage. The game is like crack, it just does something to you internally that no game other than runescape was ever able to trigger for me and just leaves you craving more and more after every play session.
---
If you can't force Enrage, yes. Otherwise fury have an advantage levels 25-40 in terms of DPS, but you have less control and are more prone to ganking since you are stance locked. 
---
I'm not too big of a fan of it myself, but I have used 2H Fury 2-3 times levels 50+ when replacing WW axe with Resurgence Rod due to having no reliable alternative axe/sword for arms.
---
No. And Alliance.
---
Day1 clears are because of PTR practice, sure that will happen in Classic but it kind of rubs me in the wrong way when people have practiced on PTR and then it is thought as day1.
---
Im actually worried about this. I want a release date but im afraid, if the reports are true that blizz lost 8m players in the first qtr of 2019, that they are going to push out an unfinished product.
---
I am even more scared that they are going to put the bs microtransactions in if it doesnt bring back the expected amount of players. I have been afraid since announcement of microtransactions being put in a year or so after launch as the playerbase will have dwindled a bit by then in my opinion but now i am terrified its going to be a month after launch so they can try to make all the money.
---
people who are telling you you're going to have no problem finding a casual guild are speaking from the perspective of mega servers with 4x the population we're likely to see, what are you going to do if one of the two casual guilds isn't a dopey "anyone can come and do anything!" and the other doesn't mesh with your hours?
---
I had 279 days on my holy paladin when icc came out and 130+ on my rogue  :D
---
It became a hack&amp;slash, change my mind
---
This "bug" is already recreated by the reimplementation of Spell Batching. Take it as you want, lots of things in Classic are broken, but if you start fixing it half the game has to go. Lots of common strategys that will be used aren't exactly the way its "meant" to be played, which doesnt make them any worse since thats the main idea of building your character. Not building your 1 out of another Million wielders of Ashbringer or whatever Idea Blizzard recently got.
---
&gt; Im actually worried about this. I want a release date but im afraid, if the reports are true that blizz lost 8m players in the first qtr of 2019, that they are going to push out an unfinished product.
---
Lost 8 million players where? :o
---
Seems like most of the last 30k subs are just effort meme shitposters
---
Except for Chef John from Foooooood Wishes .com, with! ....
---
2 main pvp builds are hemo/cb and prep/imp sprint, the first is better control and works better for low gear, the latter requires good gear but makes you more viable vs mages but suffers from energy and combo point problems.
---
Money wise you can pickpocket farm which is decent money but boring, you will have to respec between pve and pvp to be optimal.
---
Pve wise daggers and swords are both good,  there will be a shortage of melee weapons so you basically take what you can get
---
Oh definitely. It's weird what people who never played Vanilla at the time pick out as the 'cause' of WoW's downfall.
---
When Druids with 25 manual crowd pummelers in their bags are viable in Raids, people here will pretend like that is 'authentic vanilla WoW' when it was basically unheard of in 2006.
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaand Rogue is my #1 pick again
---
pshh horde players have joanna they don't need me :P
---
Completely agree with the above!
---
Roll on classic so we can all have “our” game back. 
---
BFA was actually an insult. WoW will always be my game. I’ve tried to play other games and nothing fills the void like a bit of Warcraft. But BFA - I find it impossible to play.
---
Its been the headline of like all blizzard news youtube videow xD
---
You can always play shaman or paladin dps. These are supporting dps ( not for serieus raiding ) but on a casual level they are fun to play with. The totems and blessing, resses and offheals really feels like a supporting role while dpsing.
---
paladin, only option alliance :)
---
Again, you conflate sense of accomplishment, amount of time spent playing the game and difficulty. 
---
Just because the color of an item is more available, does nothing to intrinsically increase or decrease its actual value. For the record I don’t find retail appealing for many of the same reasons, as far as I can tell modern wow is a game I wouldn’t enjoy in the slightest. 
---
But just because I wouldn’t enjoy it, does not mean it’s either easier or harder. From the little I have seen, the highest tiers of raiding require more teamwork and coordination than they did in vanilla, a lot more.
---
Your whole argument seems to be based around 1) the color of the item and 2) how much time you spend doing mundane shit in-game. 
---
I agree that ammo should be in the game, I have no issue with soul shards, key rings, lack of auto group functions or any other QoL update not being in the game. It’s part of what makes classic ... classic.
---
What is wrong here is the notion that the addition of those things made the game easier in any sense. Waiting isn’t hard. You wait for most of your adult life if you have t noticed. All the examples mentioned require waiting or doing something that takes up x amount of time.
---
You cannot possibly argue that buying ammo or farming soul shards, herbs/ores/gold is in any shape difficult. The resource is time alone. You do not in any way have to be a mechanically skilled player to succeed in any aspect of this game with the exception of 1v1/duels/wpvp. Everything else is contingent on time and your social network, arguably pve content is locked behind social interactions more than time.
---
So what you are actually saying is that you think the game needs to be gated based on how much time you put into it. That’s fine, it’s also silly and as I said in my first reply; contingent on a lot of factors. 
---
I reached 4HM in naxx by playing at most 5-6 hours per week. After BWL I didn’t even bother joining progress raids, and I ‘came back’ and played actively just as my guild killed c’thun. I kept my spot because of a lot of factors not unique to me alone, but because I bothered to stay in contact with the network and community I was part of and helped create to begin with. By your logic this shouldn’t be possible. 
---
I even had a druid I sold every single piece of item on except for my mount (long story), I got it back from a GM when transfers became a thing and I moved my horde character away from the same server. It didn’t step foot inside a single 5-man, I solely joined a friends pug raids and geared it through those and the auction house, I also killed Nef multiple times on that druid. 
---
If you wanna play the game the way you play retail, by not talking to anyone and pugging everything, chances are you won’t get past the first raid tier. But it’s not the same game, both socially and mechanically. As far as I can tell, both require you to spend time in it. Instant gratification is lame and doesn’t last. Bland game design without any unique mechanics or items, normalization and removal of everything that made wow a social experience is also lame in my opinion, it has nothing to do with difficulty.
---
You aren’t better for wanting to play classic. You like something some other people may not like. Big deal.
---
Oh i thought something like 3-4 days was world record, mistakenly remembered, my bad.
---
But still, i'm trying my best to get to 60 as fast as possible, i'm interested in my /played i'll have then tbh. i guess ~6 days then? I'll see in the end, but ty for telling me, i was a little too optimistic about it.
---
Dwarf is just so much better than Night Elf that it is disgusting.
---
Stoneskin is busted in PvE and PvP. The ability to immune out bleed and poison effects is underestimated.
---
First two or three Thunderfurys to warrs, sure, but after that we'll get our way!
---
I never played something else seriously except vanialla since 2011.
---
Just some on and off Dota2 and CS:GO when friends wanted to play...
---
+1
---
People hate it saying it's a bad game. It really isn't. It's just so different, it's no longer a traditional MMORPG (or RPG for that matter). It's more of an action game with some RPG elements.
---
Dungeons and raiding.. And especially the storytelling! is sooo much better. But the game is much more like Destiny than WoW (vanilla to WLK atleast).
---
You just press a button and farm the exact same content 100 times in 1 week to get higher ilvl. It's as you say a session based game now.
---
Classic will hopefully prove to Blizzard that Warcraft fans want an RPG, or even an RTS with the silly RPG mechanics Wc3 had. Not a session based action raid simulator.
---
I’m not saying I’m better. I’m saying Classic is harder.
---
Weapons are highly contested in PvE. Sword drops too rare for to give every Warrior/Rogue and potentially Hunter 2 of them. Dagger specs in PvE do about 85% as much damage as sword specs. Because Swords are so highly contested it's quite common to see a quarter the Rogues in a guild opt for Daggers. It's much more efficient that way in terms of loot distribution. What is a guild going to do with the dagger drops from Ragnaros &amp; C'thun? They'll be used by Rogues.  
---
As for PvP, combat sucks. It doesn't matter if you're Daggers or Swords. Not having imp stealth means you'll walk 30% slower. Yes you'll be able to rush down 1 target with Adrenaline Rush and use Sprint / Vanish to remove their CC but then you'll be stuck in slow stealth detectable stealth or a gimped warrior who'se even more vulnerable to CC. Rogues need a PvP spec to competently PvP but so do many other classes... and when everyone is gimped nobody is gimped.  
---
What Rogues will do for gold making completely depends on what Blizzard decides to do for instances. Could be anything from group runs to solo pocketing or professions. It's up in the air.
---
The warlock has sunflower, check 5m30s
---
I know that's the general belief. I was asking for more detailed answers. Chain Heal keeping pets alive vs. Blessings etc.
---
This was actually the spec I was considering. Good to hear.
---
Swords for PvE + leveling
---
Daggers for PvP
---
Have to suck it up and pay the gold fee like anybody else who wants to play with 2 or more specs. If you find a guild  that raids back to back nights you can stay in PvP spec most of the week, and then change for raids and change back after. It's annoying but a lot of people will have to do this.
---
Good to hear you opinion.
---
Hah, yeah I guess I will have to make friends with some herbalists :)
---
What will you do prior to phase 2?
---
Plate gear had a lot of agi and spirit for example, instead of +def, hit rating, stamina and dodge etc. It was just kind of random.
---
Glad to hear you opinion.
---
Titans is way better than supreme power for progression kills.
---
correct me if I am wrong, but isn't hamstring not doable? from demo footage it looked as if the mobs are able to attack you 2/3 times on each trade.
---
I’ve been ignoring classic stuff as well because I’m not trying to make the wait difficult. Really excited. But has it been confirmed wow Classic is only a couple months away? All I’ve seen is a summer release but no release date.
---
You have a point. If I am unable to find a guild that will allow me to stay Elemental, I will go hybrid spec or full Resto. I can adapt.
---
My condolences.
---
i'm doing this, prot reck for pvp and aoe leveling.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGtsezEo
---
If you're competitive by nature, go DPS. I know lots of people hate on those that post DPS charts during raids, but a bit of friendly competition is healthy imo and pushes everyone else to strive harder. Just don't pull agro ;)
---
&gt; There's zero evidence that it will work but also zero evidence that it wouldn't work.
---
That makes it speculation. If we go along with this kind of reasoning, any kind of nonsense could be included in a guide, because we have no evidence at all how the actual 1.13 will behave.
---
I disagree. I took me 8 months of farming naxx 40 to get 1 Ashbringer drop while simultaneously get 2 Atiesh staves done.
---
You’re saying classic is harder because you want to be better for liking it over retail. You have to know that right? It’s not harder. Some aspects take more time. 
---
Standing around forming groups for an hour isn’t hard.
---
Engineering + Mining will give you more income than other professions, since selling ore on AH is king. So mining will keep you up to speed with gold, and just buy / sell some stuff on AH and you're good to go for mounts etc.

\`\`\`
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
\*\*Raid nights will be:\*\*
---
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)
---
Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!
---
\*\*Loot System:\*\*
---
Loot Council
---
\*\*Our Goal:\*\*
---
To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.
---
\*\*Requirements:\*\*
---
18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)
---
Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (\~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)
---
Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

It is.
---
On actual vanilla, hardiness was also 25%, wich means roughly 1/4 of all stuns you'll ever get will be resisted fully.
---
This has nothing to do with /sit, which is wrong on privates.
---
Alliance have paladins, way better than any of the horde racials imo
---
I enjoyed dual wield Fury when I was leveling. Even with the misses it felt like you were pooling more rage for abilities. 2H Fury is just fucking boring.
---
Arms though, being able to stance dance once you get Berserker Stance/Whirlwind/MS. Fuck those /sit Macros or Hamstring kiting or whatever. That's just flat out more fun.
---
The best I could say about 2H Fury was that if you speced improve Cleave and you grabbed a bunch of mobs it felt nice to melt them like butter. When you had the fucking Rage to do anything. God forbid you want to change a stance though to keep up Rend, or to Thunderclap to slow incoming attacks.

Well, think of youtube titles as the most toxic piece of garbage that you've ever seen. Even worse than newspapers titles.

&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.

Retail WoW is a dumbed down hack &amp; slash, just like the game it was modeled after: Diablo 3.
---
Nope, I have no desire to feel better. Vanilla is harder. It just is. Having to invest more time to do the same thing makes it harder. But not just that. Not being able to zerg rush through a dungeon and having to think about CC makes it harder.
---
Because most of classic emulation data was actually created from official TBC and not official vanilla. Like quest exp (basically doubled) and some other things.
---
Also, it's really hard to reverse engineer a game with so much data like WoW.
---
Ya thats why i said if its true. I didnt watch any of them or do any research on it since i really dont care. I wouldnt be surprised though. Of all the people i know, even the ones who played through every expansion no matter how bad, not a single one is still playing BFA. 
---
All im saying is i hope they dont fk up classic to try and make their money if BFA is failing them.
---
If you want to craft stuff for your friends then I'd suggest going alchemy because that's always needed. 
---
Leveling up you can always heal dungeons even if you level as dps. The talents won't really matter until you start raiding. 
---
It does sound like you would like to play a disc priest because not only are you healing, but you are also capable of focus healing very efficiently. Which means a rogue friend or whatever can ask you to focus on him so he can stay in on AoE heavy fights like Baron Geddon, Golemagg, Firemaw etc. In addition to that you also get the amazing cooldown Power Infusion, which all the mages and warlocks will fight and sacrifice virgins to get. Further addition to that, if you play a dwarf priest you get fear ward which you can place on your mate (providing the tank is covered by another dwarf priest). Priests in general are some of the most popular players and it's easy to make a name for yourself if you do it well. They are also one of the most complicated healers bar druids. Especially compared to paladins spamming flash of light or shamans spamming chain heal.

It's not about wasted racials it's about making a difference on important fights like raid bosses.
---
Maybe 2 bosses are beasts, regeneration is so small that it's absolutely useless and throwing ? Are you trolling me ?
---
Yes bfa is a more casual game, you're missing the point. There's a difference between a game being casual and a player being casual. Classic is very accessible and enjoyable for a casual player, a casual player can progress through 5/7 of the raids without dedicating a huge amount of time to farm endless consumables.
---
No one said it was more casual, why do you keep saying that?
---
Just play a hybrid class that can do both, so you're not stuck in a role you might end up not enjoying.
---
Anathema is so dead I might as well delete my character
---
Understandable
---
You got downvoted but you are telling the truth.
---
Lol this sub sucks, better post a bad meme so I can get upvotes
---
The m.io score is more cancer than ilvl ever was imo. Like sorry my score isnt great since I did a ton of carry runs for my not amazing players but amazing people guildies, many of whom were still learning. It was even worse being a resto shaman in Legion because no one would want to invite me, but everyone was saying how stunned they were at how well I did afterwards. 
---
People don't wanna hear this, but that kind of elitist short-sighted bullshit is going to follow us into Classic.
---
or with spell batching
---
I'm doing the same thing you are, will be rolling my first ally char now in classic. I feel like just getting a whole new leveling experience will make it worth it.
---
Dunno about that. I think raiding guilds are more likely to take someone who puts in the effort to get consumables and enchants than a casual player who doesn’t do any of that.
---
In many ways, it has. Even the dungeon and raid design have become this by how disposable they feel. It's like playing any Diablo like game, the first time around it's pretty good, but in subsequent playthroughs, it's just a race to end for the loot. To the point you are hardly aware of the context of the fights and the zone.
---
I think how dungeons were harder, longer, winding and involved in Vanilla helped retain their personality, and therefore, not as disposible. Also having to journey to them and not be teleported there give them a more special feeling.
---
You can also bybass Scholomance door as ghost.
---
It depends on the mob, the angle you run at, latency, as well as rank of hamstring - the earlier ranks of hamstring are harder to it with because they slow less, but hamstring kiting is less important then
---
Play a Mage if you want to help people. You'll level faster than the vast majority of classes, can make food/water, can portal people around, and would be a perfect match for enchanting. You have no idea how many friends you'll make sitting in Darnassus opening portals to Iron Forge and Stormwind. People will be constantly messaging you for portals, food, or enchants.
---
One of the cool things about the warlock is that we can die on command by hellfiring to death. Not only is this a great tool to use during wipes because you don't lose durability, but it's also nice to get past locked doors because you can just die at the door and ress on the other side. 
---
You mentioned Scholomance, another one is Scarlet Monastery. A lesser known one is the crypts underneath Karazhan. They are normally locked behind a gate that can't be opened in any way shape or form, but warlocks can ghost walk through and mages can sheep others through in a duel.
---
Really worse than WoD for me.
---
MMORNG
---
Like I said "possible" not guaranteed. It has nothing to do with the slow factor, but that Classic will be running on an new client which updates a more frequently than Vanilla did.   
---
If hamstring does work (as demonstrated in the Classic Demo) then it might have much tighter window and could be unreliable.   
---
The hit ratio could change from 1:1 to 1:1.5.   
---
Sometimes the enemy gets 1 hit off when you get into melee range, sometimes they get off 2.  
---
This is all conjecture, but it's worth noting.
---
I stopped playing after they released Wotlk and kept daily quests. It's lazy fucking development. There was always something to do in vanilla without the need for daily quests. I might play TBC, just because I feel like it had to best raid content of all the expansions.
---
&gt; Askmrrobot shouldn't be in classic.
---
It's not really needed in Classic anyway. All itemisation is weel known for every class and every specs.
---
I remember seeing this one and thinking, it was just some new thing discovered after vanilla wow cos nobody was doing it when i was playing, and me and my friend had rogues.
---
The*
---
WoW is nothing like Diablo 3.
---
Yup, run, pack the mobs, AOE them down, repeat ...
---
But you dont need to farm large amounts of consumables for 5/7 of the raids, only aq40 and naxx require a huge time investment for farming  expensive consumables and resist gear.
---
ele sham is the least offensive hybrid at least
---
Do you guys seriously have so little going on in your life, and so little self-control that you're spending every waking hour in a panic over this video game??!
---
I always regreted it.
---
By the time I could find rare recipes and decided to farm the mats, I'd already be equipped with a better piece from raiding or even dungeons.
---
WoW, so much patience and knowledge.  
---
What about horde guide?
---
Of course! PM me when you have the time! :)
---
Been playing so much in private servers lately, that yeah, wow does creep into dreams sometimes.
---
You’re gonna walk into MC without fire resistance?
---
It turned into a work. But this is what happens after appealing to "please free" crowd for 15 years.
---
I've removed this post because the link is dead. Please repost it whenever you get a working/non-removed link.
---
They should just drop it on us, boom, classic servers live, go go. People will whine about wanting to know in advance and be angry that Blizzard didn't "tell them". Blizzard does not have to tell you anything, they are making this once in human history legendary return of a game, be grateful that it's even coming at all.
---
Yeah I’m aware, I wasn’t complaining. I was just asking what people do or how common daggers are in pve.
---
Boi you ain't right, just get a shit bucket.
---
Ty! :) I actually did Tirisfal some time ago, you can check them out here (just scroll down a bit): https://www.artstation.com/dlikt
---
Bigger? This man doesn't understand how this works.. lol
---
And that was awful... 
---
Legion seemed to take a step in the right direction so it’s a shame to see them U-Turn that success almost instantly. 
---
Shows how little they actually listen to the community now. It’s mad to think that I’m way more excited about the initial version of this game and them just hitting the reset button than I am of any further renditions.
---
Take me back to where it all began and where they can’t change or ruin anything else. (I hope).
---
I didn't level prot, so I'm not speaking from experience, but I feel like you'd just take longer to kill mobs. Even with a 2h in Battle/Berserker Stance, you don't have as much damage boosting talents. You'd probably be better off with a shield and 1 handed, and a fast one would probably mean you generally have more rage than 2H Fury, but meh.
---
Arms is really quite good, especially after you get Berserker Stance, Whirlwind, and Mortal Strike (basically, between 30-40). Being able to jump stances without being gimped on (as hard) is nice.
---
Anger Management is super good, and even though it sounds like a dead talent. Despite not being in the tool tip it helps you generate rage in combat. Crit bleeds and Rend add up as well.
---
2H fury is boring as sin. I'd almost prefer dual wield Fury, since it feels like you're not just sitting around on auto attacks.
---
So do the items really not have stats on them in BFA? Just wondering, I don't ever plan on playing. Waiting on classic like the rest of us. But if that is true then dear God how boring has it gotten?
---
In PVP they have their place but during raids, it's a meme. An equally geared/buffed fury warrior will deal \~twice the DPS of a ret pally. No joke. The difference is that staggering.
---
But Hardiness is better than WotF. I’d much rather have a passive chance to resist an extremely common form of CC than to remove fears/charms.
---
This goes even more so for a warlock (in my opinion). How badly do you really need WotF to win a mirror matchup against alliance warlocks?
---
Don’t get me wrong, I know it’s a great racial. Though, I feel that most people who say WotF is better just really want to play undead. There’s nothing wrong with that, and I do see how an activated skill can be better/more wanted than a passive. 
---
But really, when the passive is as good as vanilla orc stun resist... I just can’t pass it up. Really, I don’t even know what vanilla is like without it. All I’ve ever done is played orcs throughout vanilla (not for racial at the time, just looks).
---
I've really come to despise item level on gear over the years. At first, I thought it was great improvement but over time it just trivialized everything so much. And for me, this goes way beyond just WoW.
---
Destiny was sorta cool at 1st because everyone was forever 29 til you got all 4 peices from the VoG Raid, with the helm only being from the hard mode(i think). So, altho the gear didn't have much for stats to differentiate itself, the early premise felt fine and you gear/lvl could clearly should what you accomplished. But as Destiny went on, they too went with the Light Level(aka item level system), and soon you would realize that gear wasn't much different and the only that mattered was that arbitrary number due to how delta scaling worked.
---
My latest issue is with the latest Division 2 game, which started off great but you soon came to realize that as world tier increased, along with item lvls, the gear itself didn't change much. All of the percentage based had the same floor/ceiling at 250 gear score as it did at 450, the only thing that went up was the armor value which didn't mean much with the faster TTK. It was just artificial scaling of a number and your gear didn't actually get any better.
---
Maybe this is my biggest reason for wanting to get back into classic wow. Sure items got better as you advanced from 5 mans to MC/Ony to Bwl to AQ40 then Naxx, but the gear didn't have some stupid number on it for idiots who couldn't tell what is better. 
---
I feel like we lose out on one of the most important elements of an RPG when we stop comparing stats on gear and just reference some item lvl to determine what's better. It requires no thinking and I can't even imagine how people could even enjoy item levels at all.
---
Seems you missed where I mention the front stab/shred builds - that is what I have been referring to, not /sit
---
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to run dungeons, pvp, or raid casually, you'll be fine. Your buffs and ability to rez will still be valued. If you want to be in a hardcore guild, pick something else.
---
if 8 million players quit no one would be left, since I don't really think they have more than 8 million players :D And WoW is very much alive.
---
Wow, you need to talk to somebody.  This isn't a healthy way to live your life.
---
i'd still consider you to be real good at 6 days. i think most 'hardcore' players will end up 8-10 days, maybe 7 for hunter/lock/dudu.
---
a 'slow' leveler for me is 15 days+.
---
14 irl days should deff be doable though :) if you play enough
---
you can mix T1 and T2 pieces with some of the purely offensive items such as the Titanic Leggins. its not too hard to reach reasonable offensive stats while maintaining arround 5k life unbuffed.
---
bracers, head and X will effectively give you +30 ATP.  
---
T1 hands give you 44ATP and 1hit.  
---
early on the T1 shoulders are one of the best PvP shoulders you can get.  
---
the resistances on the sets are not bad either.
---
assuming you get access to a good 2 hander it should not be much of a problem to get a proper gearset for PvP.
---
Get conc of holy tree and then go prot. While reckbomb /sit doesnt work the dps trees dont REALLY make any big difference in DPS. In prot you can fight multiple mobs better and in retri you can do bit more solo target dps.
---
You do your judgements and autoattack everything death anyways. Prot gives great buffs and reck procs still happen.
---
No, I am not worried. I \*know\* I will get addicted, but I also know that this addiction will not last long. After several months, I will hit a boundary on which I will probably not enjoy myself enough anymore to warrant playing so much. And once I start playing less, the bond becomes less and I will slowly work myself towards the unsub action.
---
Happened every single expansion up to Cata, after which I quit after 1 month already. I have no doubt it will happen with Classic as well. But the first month, I will behave like a coke addict in a delerium probably.
---
A fire resist potion is plenty, and the difficulty difference between MC and the 2 last raids means you're not going to be wiping 100+ times needing to refresh it. 
---
MC with 1.12 talents is a bit of a joke and most of the instance doesn't even need fire resist
---
Hey man, of course :)
---
First of all, the Master's brushes haha: https://www.deviantart.com/88grzes/art/My-Brushes-505743662
---
I pick something out that has a texture to it that you like, and then the most important thing: somehow turn on the opacity-pressure setting on your tablet/painting program. Brush opacity HAS to be controlled by pen pressure, otherwise you can't really blend values on the canvas, and suddenly you are using a very fancy inking brush to paint :) That's basically it. An interesting looking brush shape with pen pressure on. Hope this helps!
---
I honestly believe they have way more then 8 million subs. No one knows tho since they never release the numbers so its all guess work
---
I hope not, and I certainly hope not with an API.
---
Wotf was the best PvP racial because it was another trinket with 5 seconds immunity added on top. The worst form of cc back then was fear.
---
So, not a new expansion.. But also a new expansion?
---
How so is horde more HC when it comes to raiding? XDDD
---
Well, they're viable. Not the best you can get but they look cool and do what needs to be done.
---
Oh these made me really happy!
---
Thank you, glad you like them! :) You can grab a print over here: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/
---
Could you link to some of those discussions?
---
Just a few examples and not all at once, but yeah maybe even a brand new expansion, staying true to vanilla
---
What makes raid bosses important? Most people won't be fighting many of them and they'll make up a small fraction of your play time. 
---
The troll racials are great for doing what most players will be doing most of the time, leveling and grinding. 
---
Throwing is important to finished off that running mob while you're snared so he doesn't pull 3 more that would kill you because vanish is on cooldown.
---
Like.. Tbc?
---
Hey, thank you! You can get HQ prints of them here: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/ (This is where I upload most of my stuff)
---
Seeing as how employee beta just seemingly ended, yeah, I'd say it's pretty much going to be on time. That, and there's been no change of plans for a summer release.
---
You know, the release window they provided. That's what I'm basing it on. Summer.
---
I'd say we're slowly moving to being stricter on low effort meme posts, but we definitely will be at our near launch when there is more active gameplay to discuss.
---
Farming some negative Karma here I see.
---
Ofc it’s toxic most people are only on here cause their bored and pissed about waiting on classic lol
---
Same with frontstabbing on rogues.
---
Thank you! Eerie but beautiful (almost nostalgic) is what I am going for, it's so cool to see people feel it too :)
---
I dont trust the current wow creators *aka, wod,legion,bfa.* To make content for vanilla.  
---
So id say no, they should not go there.
---
by far the best thing about vanilla is the uniqueness of certain items and consumables.  hunting down an obscure quest for a low level green trinket because it has a specific use for pvp?  getting super mana efficiency out of a green offhand with no stats that helps you in raids? (with progressive itemisation anyway... RIP)
---
It's funny how people think blizzard only has copyright in the US 😏
---
You're forgetting the difference is there was a time limit in Vanilla until the next expansion.
---
There's no time limit here and classic will never get an expansion. I promise it will be on farm and likely be more easily cleared than it was prior a few years in by, as I said, established guilds.
---
I just want them to do Classic BC and Classic Wrath and then stop. :\^
---
you know none of the prep will work, right? It’s a modern client
---
I would only go as far as Wrath but I’m keenly interested in TBC. 
---
But we will see how well they do with Vanilla first.
---
thank you! :) No Twitter, but I do update this profile each time I make something new if you are interested: https://www.artstation.com/dlikt
---
You have a healthy mix of support and dps, by going Hunter. Giving Aura+Wolf pet to melee, while still doing damage.
---
And it's not even a good one.
---
I am! :D
---
Would be situational for tanking though. The mitigation provided by like a Warden staff would be almost required for some fights.
---
I'd draw the line at WotlK. Please no Cataclysm again. TBC and WotlK were probably my best gaming years.
---
Vanilla was nice, despite not really speaking English much and having no clue as to what I was doing. Only made it to 58 before TBC came out.
---
Regardless, I'm going to have a blast!
---
Maybe once the player base smooths out they can try something similar to what OSRS does where players can go to major cities every few months and vote on additions or changes that the Devs can implement. This would solve the disconnect between blizzard and their audience and take some heat off blizzard if changes are made. The downside to this system is that sometimes players will vote for or against changes that don’t effect them but do effectively hamper other players. In OSRS it’s the pvp and pve players voting against each other to try and get new content for themselves faster. 
---
There are a ton of variables but unless it’s a system in this nature I think Blizzard would risk alienating a decent portion of the fan base Classic is bringing back.
---
Thanks :D
---
I see, thank you for the reply. Rank 2 of hamstring is only available at level 32 and grant extra 5% slow, to me it seems that
---
fist: its a long time to go without the methode
---
second: a 5% increase (40-45) wouldn't matter much
---
It might be indeed relevant to the mob, I also can't seem to find people who hamstring kited mobs well on the demo. 
---
It seems a bit risky to count on it.
---
Horizontal content produces new items and that can only give three outcomes
---
1. New more powerful items than the previous raids, making the gap between new players and geared too large.  Face rolling old raids in a half hour for specific loot
---
2. Similar gear itemization as a current raid so the difficulty would have to be exactly the same, so people dont choose the easy raid over the hard one
---
3. Hybrid spec specific loots that help out odd specs become extremely viable so that the game feels more balanced.  These items would then become mandatory to play your class or you would be otherwise turned down.
---
So no, no horizontal content.  Leave it be
---
I think he was trying to say that out of those 5k clicks/sec, he was able to get a facestab to work once in that second with a lag switch.
---
Not only did BfA drastically shit on WoWs gameplay, it absolutely shat on the lore too. Its just a mistake.
---
Only the art team did well. Drustvar is a _magnificent_ zone, second only to OG Darkshire in creepiness.
---
Check out the dreamweave set. In the 40s it is a good grind. Trolls in stv drop a reagent and the heart of the wild is harder to find in the low 40s
---
Some elementals in swamp of sorrow drop em but at a low rAte.
---
Agreed. I miss the time when I knew the names and stats of items for max level. Hah I knew the rares for level 30 characters.
---
Yeah, that's why I'll take the legendary mount. None of the weapons make sense or are available for a healadin.
---
I'm actually working my dream job as well, super duper nice.
---
But on the other hand... It's vanilla WoW...
---
It's just lost too many RPG elements. The combat is more complex and difficult in BFA than it is in Vanilla (In heroic/mythic raids and mythic +). Asides from the combat everything else is significantly worse in BFA than it is in Vanilla.
---
Honestly, they should have planned that strategy for last Blizzcon. Would have saved the entire conference.
---
Alliance, most likely. 
---
1-10 in Teldrassil, then I'm going to Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood, Southshore, Theramore, and after that I don't know. 
---
I'd like to see how much Stormwind rep I can get before 40. It would be cool to have a horse as my first mount but I don't know if that kind of rep is possible in Classic. It's not going to stop me from trying though.
---
Pretty sure it wasn't randomly generated.
---
I just started recruiting. Can you tell me any words of advise or the best place to find recruits? What day is the reddit community recruitment post?
---
Go look at any of the other 10000 threads on this subject
---
What is this formatting? Are you writing a poem?
---
But would you say it’s easier than clicking the group finder button, queueing for a raid, and afk while other people kill the boss?
---
Without account sharing there will still be enough people who do literally nothing but grind honor and sleep - which means 18+ hours every single day for weeks and months - to prevent anyone with a life from achieving R12 or higher. That's the bar without gaming the system. At least when "cheating" you can put in a slightly less insane amount of time and still get it.
---
There's a reason why so many R14 players immediately suffered a burnout afterwards and quit the game.
---
The only one responsible for this unimaginably unhealthy system is Blizzard.
---
Is taking time off work crazy? I'm taking a week off and it feels like the only logical thing to do...
---
Me too thanks
---
I'm glad i'm mistaken and it's not that fast. In retail it was always like, getting to max level on day 1 as fast as possible and u always had to keep up with others.
---
Vanilla though won't be that much of a rush as there is a huge gap between people to get to 60. I just enjoy my speedrun and go for the best /played i can. I'm definitely not one of those Hardcore speedrunners, i never was and could never be, no matter the game. But this time i atleast want to try to get to 60 asap.
---
Though i'm not yet 100% sure if i'll go for Druid.
---
This... This I can get behind.
---
Give Paladins a taunt too while we’re at it.
---
No, I literally won't give a shit.
---
There's gonna be a ton of herbalists right out of the gate I assume.  Like way more than there ought to be, cause they're thinking the same as you.
---
players and gms have no better things to do than play frontstab police lol
---
Since there's no honor or ranks in Phase 1, I'll be using this time to mainly do PvE stuff in preparation for PvP. Leveling to 60, acquiring pre-raid BIS, work on my MC/Ony raid pieces, level a hunter to 60 and start acquiring wealth. Then once I'm totally prepared the PvP mayhem can begin with Phase 2.
---
Piercing howl available at level 20 can be used in place of hamstring because it slows 50%, but this generally is only needed on mobs with big hitboxes like ogres. otherwise 40% is enough, it just takes practice to move at good angles to make full use of it. I remember it being a thing in vanilla, so unless the way hit detection was done is changed in classic, it should be okay. Most of the mobs with fast attack speeds have small hit boxes: Cats, Wolves, Humanoid Rogues
---
IIRC the ranking brackets aren't tied to absolute honor values, i.e. the guy with the most honor per week gets the same amount of rank points regardless of whether they farmed 100k honor from camping flight paths or 300k honor from stomping PUGs with a premade.
---
I hope they release NEW classic servers starting from phase 1 all over again. F R E S H
---
I had 100 days played in 2005 alone. I don't want to know what I was up to by the time Wotlk came out.
---
Because people buying gold from chinese farmers run the risk of being banned. Buying gold is cheating, at best it's pay to win, and you should be punished for it.
---
Okay, portals to major cities were one of the nice additions. Using flightpaths was nothing more than a pure timesink with no actual reward.
---
Totally agreed on the rest, though.
---
 **&lt;IRONFIST&gt; (HORDE-NA CST)  PVP** 
---
Hey everyone,  I'm going to make this short and sweet. &lt;IRONFIST&gt; is going to be playing WoW: Classic and we are looking to bring in some more folks to join us. We actually still play on Burning Legion (US-Alliance) and are a day one guild, so we know a thing or two about original WoW. (We will be going Horde for WoW: Classic because we have spent 15 years as alliance and desire a change.) 
---
We want people who just are looking to have fun with friends and get stuff done but not take it super seriously. We will raid, PvP, run dungeons all of the stuff you expect, but we are realistic when it comes to game/work/life balance as most of us who have been playing since 2004 are adults and need to get things done before video games. 
---
Toxic people who cannot get along with others are removed, we do not have time for that.  So, what do you need to do to join us? Just hop over to discord and tell us you want to join. 
---
While waiting for Classic you can join our members in other games, join in on some conversations, or if you really want, just hang out until the servers launch.  
---
Raid times TBD: We are adults and want to come up with raid times as a collective that works with everyone.  Questions? Go ahead and ask -  by PM or visit [https://ironfistgaming.com/](https://ironfistgaming.com/)

[NA (EST) | PvP (with PvE focus) | Horde]
---
**Est. Raid/group activity time:** 8-11pm EST, Mon, Wed &amp; Fri
---
**a bit about us:** I'm a 31-year old Vanilla-to-WoTLK vet chasing that same nostalgia that I'm sure a lot of you are. For the past 4 years, I've lead a tight-knit bunch of young, working adults through numerous other games and MMOs. With the impending release of Classic, many of us, newcomers and vets alike, will be teaming up for what I believe to be one of the best experiences gaming has ever offered. We're not elitists. Whether your goal is to play casually or no-life the game, you're welcome here with us.
---
**Goals:** Initially, our focus as a guild will be leveling, experiencing the content and teaching the newbies all they need to progress. When a large enough number of us are ready, those who wish to do so will transition into raiding several nights a week. Those who don't are more than welcome to continue to enjoy the game however they choose.
---
**Rules:** Be excellent to each other and excersize common sense. We don't police language or humor, just be respectful. You're not required to be on at X time or X number of days per week. It's a game. If we have a movie night, you can come or not come. Your standing in the guild is based on your attitude in and out of game, not how many hours you've logged or how high your DPS is.
---
If you're interested in joining or have any concerns, don't hesitate to PM me directly here or DM me in Discord. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

Same. I'm not really interested in twinking but just for collecting purposes it would be fun to be able to collect gear at an appropriate level, or just stay at a level bracket you like.
---
Well - as Long as it only puts the People opting into the new texture at a disadvantage - why not give People the Option?
---
Cb/Swords for levelling 
---
Daggers to get through the phase 1 loot (as it’ll be the phase with the least content so swords will be hard af to get but if I roll lucky then yeah sure) 
---
Swords from phase 2 onwards was my plan.
---
Priest here :D
---
For your sake I will pray that you have the endurance to wait that long. or to say it in some other lame movie quote: May the odds be ever in your favor. Chances are the fourth set of Thunderfury drops in week #4
---
Took you only 10 years to realize this?
---
In BGs Rogues are the most unwanted class. Even their best use that consists of stealth capping in AV is a complete joke vs premades.  
---
Then duels? Shadow Priests, Soul Link Warlocks, Frost Mages and Hunters mop the floor with Rogues. 5 out of 9 classes just beat you if equally skilled and properly PvP spec'd.
---
Rogues are very fun in WPvP but I wouldn't say they are the 'to go to' class for PvP in general. Unlike what World of Roguecraft tried to tell you they have many shortcomings.
---
If it burns like that when you pee, you need to see a doctor

I'd say so. I started with MapleStory and could never understand why people complained about WoW being slow. Coincidentally I agree with OP.
---
The truth hurts and they don't want to accept it
---
I stopped playing vanilla private servers the day it was announced because i didnt want to get burnt out and not want to play wben official came out.
---
yeah i actually bought a blue one hand and it feels so good giving proper dmg. Im duoleveling with my warlock friend, so i've specced Prot and is wielding a shield aswell, so we're flying through the zones! i still even top the dps chart even if it's a one-hander.
---
but yeah thats what i figured.  i can make gold later. while im leveling right now, im alsp taking care of my professions so i think i will be good
---
not randomly generated but seen to what the classes needed it was quite random stats a=)
---
Have they changed it?
---
It's never best in slot for hunters though
---
That's a pretty good description of the state of the game.
---
Yeah age of conan had this but you chose your instance of a full zone, which was slightly better.  It meant you could get away from griefers, but it also meant you saw less people and the world felt less 'real'
---
I can accept sharding in starting zones but beyond that wow doesn't need it
---
Primary concern will be hauling around two sets of gear, one for healing with as much INT and Spirit as possible, the other with STR and Stamina for solo content. This is the most defining factor whether and how easily you can heal dungeons while leveling. This will put constraints on your logistics, i.e. bag space, unfortunately. Talent choice is not as crucial whether you can do either, actually. This applies for most if not all classes. I'm still deciding between Shaman and Paladin but if I'd go paladin, I'd do following talent progression, with healing and leveling in mind (no respecs needed).
---
20 -   [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AAACzwE](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AAACzwE) \- there won't be much healing going on till now so there's no reason to invest in it.
---
40 -   [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A\_TQnAACzwE](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A_TQnAACzwE) \- full holy from now on, retri doesn't offer enough value anymore without heavily investing in it.
---
51 -   [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BPk0PTQAAs8B](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BPk0PTQAAs8B) \- you'll have all the tools at your disposal now. The rest of the points you can put wherever you like.
---
60 -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BPo0PTQBzALPAQ](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BPo0PTQBzALPAQ) \- you can dip even in prot for extra armor for group, up to you at this point.
---
well put, my friend.
---
But you're not really playing PvP when farming honor as a premade. Once the randoms recognize your names (or they see a bunch of helmets on the scoreboard) they will stop fighting you. Back in Vanilla it only took a day or two of farming before we could just 5-cap Arathi Basin without any opposition. 99% of games were just 5 of our guys capping nodes while the rest went fishing in the lake together with the other faction.
---
Other premades are avoided by use of scouts: only one guy accepts the invite to check for a premade, and the rest of the group only joins when it's a PUG. Switch out the scout while they wait for the Deserter debuff to expire.
---
Classic is going to be modeled after EQ and in some ways diablo 3. They will release servers periodically sort of like seasons to get people competing for world first achievements.
---
Holy fuck, this was a lot better than I expected it to be.
---
&gt;Playing bfa got me thinking yesterday
---
Hahahah, you almost got me there! 😂
---
Wow subs started to decline by millions, and in WoD they had around 8 million (source Blizzard), and I'm quite sure it has dropped since then.
---
The titels could be correct on the youtube vids if they refer to WoWs peak towards player count today.
---
Very viable but very very very gear dependant. Dont pick it if you are casual. Back in the day my friend was rank14 ret pal and he was nearly invincible in RBG
---
Reddit is useless for recruitment, you want to get in Discord. Google wow guilds discord.
---
No you didnt. I was just making an example. You didnt give any information on whats your goal is. I was jsut assuming or what ever
---
Now tell us dishonestly
---
Can you link me to that blizz source? As far as i know blizz has never officially stated what its subs for WoW were
---
ah one of the daily "wHaT aBOUt aFTEr nAXx" posts.  
---
Use search function please.  
---
You will see the opinion in 1 of the milion post there... no need to re-create a topic for that.
---
Difference between sharding and hardcore sharding? I'm against sharding in any sense as it just ruins the community in my opinion, but only knew of "sharding"
---
I keep seeing people claim that "top raiding guilds" will start by equipping their entire raid with R14 gear because the weapons are so good.
---
I don't even know how long that would take. Farming literally 24/7 for months just to rank the small handful of people who can occupy the top brackets at the same time?
---
Yeah, the poll is meaningless with this selection bias. People will just choose "Old WoW player" even if the second or third options apply too, causing the poll to skew in favor of option one.
---
Can't agree more with that.
---
This game is fun but its not what it should be for me. I am really seeing forward to classic.
---
The meta has changed so much. I remember being deep frost back in the day, and everyone thought my spec was just the stupidest.
---
Every games i'm currently playing are the "waiting and pass the time" game before classic comes. I really can't wait to have this sentiment of excitement when I turn On my pc after work to play with 2 friends and my wife. 
---
Right now, every time I turn on my pc, I'm a little depressed because I sit in front of my desktop thinking about what game I'm gonna play but knowing none of them gonna give me satisfaction.
---
back in the days, it wasn't a problem either.  
---
If you are not mentally challenged, you'd be fine.  
---
Yeah you will fail some times, but i assume you will improve.  
---
Look for guides and rotations and you'll be fine.

 **\[H\] &lt;fit&gt;** is actively seeking players for a Classic PvP server!  
---
**About Us:** Our leadership consists of players who have cleared vanilla content while it was current content and perennial Cutting Edge Mythic raiding experience in retail.  We intend to raid on a relatively light schedule while maintaining a competitive pace and rank on our server. We are on the lookout for players with a similar mentality to bolster our roster going into Classic. Looking for players that enjoy playing the game beyond just logging on for raids.  
---
**Recruitment:** Currently open to all classes and appropriate specializations.  
---
**What we are looking for:** Since we're a  2 day raiding guild we expect raiders to use their time in raiding efficiently. This means being inside the instance, buffed, and ready to pull at 8pm with any consumables required for your role.  Alts will not be mandatory.  
---
**Loot &amp; Schedule**

Days Saturday &amp; Sunday  
---
Hours 8-11 EST.

Aka it has been said that starting zones and first few weeks would probabaly be sharded for a smooth launch, which isn’t the same as current retail sharding where there is 40 different boralus shards.
---
Sauce? As far as we know this isnt the case.
---
Ok.
---
You probably haven't noticed. The private server community is extremely toxic and they've been here since day one.
---
hotw druids are also hybrids and quite strong ones tbh
---
no.
---
Ohh so it only will be starting zones and not like stor wind that will be shards?

Hey so if they are striping out files from BFA client, and that is what we are running on, does that mean that on launch day as long as we have BFA up to date, we will not have a seperate download for classic? For example, will there just be a button to push on the launcher to switch to classic mode?
---
Like elwynn forest, dun murough, cities are its own “zone” so it’s separated
---
If your ilvl is high, but your stats are super messed up, then you will def suck
---
&gt;People don't wanna hear this, but that kind of elitist short-sighted bullshit is going to follow us into Classic. 
---
Oh it absolutely is. That is not just a problem with retail though. This is a trend in gaming as a whole as it has become more interconnected. The more a community gets a feel for what works, the more that community starts to think there is only one way to do something. Things that are not considered "optimal" start to be considered bad.
---
Anyone who PUGed heroics as shaman in TBC will tell you that not having a CC often made getting into groups difficult. Were shaman bad? Did their lack of CC make them not worth taking? No, they just had other, more flexible, less easy to see tools. Were they optimal? Probably not, but why would that matter to a PUG? All that should have mattered was that they were good enough with some thought.
---
I am *pumped* for Classic, but I am a little concerned that the desire for "efficiency" will become a problem from a community perspective.
---
I agree with some of this, but disagree with other aspects.  
---
Yes you run through and if you click through quests withoutfollowing the story, sure, the raids feel as if they lack personality. The game prompts you to ignore quest text so i don't blame the players.  
---
But that aside, if you do read the quests and follow the lore, its pretty interesting. And Mythic raids are definitely more defined and original than anything in Classic. I love vanilla and im itching to get to it, but if you stripped all the 'but every player needs to experience ALL content' mentality blizzard now has, the mythic tier content is still pretty awesome.
---
I 100% agree iwth the OP on what's happened to items.
---
It all depends on how large Classic's player base actually gets. If it surpasses retail then there's a pretty good chance Blizzard will look at creating new realms that continue on to TBC. If it's just popular enough to justify its own existence then we won't get anything at all beyond the phases and general maintenance. Will they ever create new content for Classic? Probably not. If anything content in Retail will become more Classic-like depending on its success. Leaks put the current WoW sub count at less than 2 million so I'd say Classic has a good shot of surpassing it. A single Pserver had around 150k active players.
---
Same. I know I'll have fun in Pservers but playing there will certainly kill the fun on Classic servers for me. Mostly because it'll be too fresh in my experience to go through it again and still have fun.
---
Passing /r/mylittlepony is only reason I'm here. Now my job is done and I can finally rest.
---
He's Nostradamus, dude.
---
Yes and no. While it’s true his settings won’t be saved, and many of the addons won’t be available at launch, he is still able to test button layouts and get an idea of whether he likes certain addons etc. This at least streamlines his setup later by understanding his preferences which will minimize the amount of experimenting he needs to do later.
---
I don't even think that raiding is better IMO. It's more complex and hectic, but I prefer just killing big dragons with a huge group of friends in a slow but steady RPG setting. I can't take in any atmosphere or adventure. 
---
My screen is just filled with pop up windows and bullet hell minigames, while the whole group is doing an elaborate dance choreography.
---
yikes
---
haha fair, I have no technical knowledge on what kind of impact a deliberate lag inducing program may have to the game, hopefully none aside from frontstabbing :P
---
Oh please, as if classic is any harder or any better.  Literally everyone knows what is BiS just by looking at the item stats, reading a guide, or plugging it into a spreadsheet. 
---
Gearing in classic takes very little brainpower once you know what to look for. And guess what? Everything has already been figured out, for decades. Once you get your blues from 5 mans ready, you more or less lose any free will when it comes to gearing and are at the mercy of chance. Everyone will be going after the same BiS items and its totally random if the item will drop. Theres no decision making, aside from choosing if you want a shittier item because of less competition. If you are a dps class, you will not be able to do more damage by assembling some clever combination of non-bis items. As a healer, you get to make a few choices on either more mana, more regen, or more healing which also are negligible. 
---
Having your stats be summarized by an itemscore doesnt change the difficulty of the game itself at all. When you make a pug in classic and are inspecting gear of your invites, you are mentally calculating a gearscore, albeit less accurately. You can still min/max with gearscore if you want. Actually, that might be even more difficult to do because of how much more complex retail stats are compared to classic, with haste, mastery, and versatility
---
How will this work in the first week of classic - will there be a World Defense channel for the sharded Ellwyn Forest? Or will a single server be divided into shards? If somebody decides to raid it, would raiding a single shard cause a server-wide alert?
---
Can confirm. This is a real problem. Looks nice though!
---
There will be only WPvP in first 4 months.
---
They’ve re confirmed the summer release timeline several times. Worst case scenario, the date will be September 22nd which is 4.5 months away.
---
I did that grind back in vanilla, and I'm not sure I can face doing it one more time. We'll see.
---
Weapon swapping is a thing. You can dw, and then swap to a slow 2hander when you get a dodge for overpower. I wouldn't suggest it all the time, but it can be a fun way to play at lower levels when you don't have mortal strike or whirlwind.
---
It definitely is a problem for gaming as a whole, and it's annoying and impossible to get away from.
---
Every "Gold" rated player will utter trivia to you at even the slightest movement away from meta as though you were a sinner across from a priest in confession. 
---
It didn't matter that I could link them my parses of both raid and high tier encounters. I was automatically subpar, so why not bring a deece holy pally who have the best bells and whistles.
---
Ha! Sure, there were some things much more hardcore about vanilla. But the overall philosophy was "come as you please" and now it is "please come every day!" (which influences how things are designed)  
---
PvP ranks in vanilla was certainly more of the latter... but only for those who chose to do that grind.
---
If horde is pvp faction, will be easier to gain ranks on alliance side, because of lesser competition?
---
That game blew my friends mobo up. Best game ever.
---
Nah. Can always just faction change if it does get bad, but there's something to representing an under represented faction. You feel more like you're needed.
---
Well of course, that's really besides the point. Obviously a server dies out when it reaches naxx and there's nothing new.
---
This is why this reddit appear toxic, this thread pops literally once a hour.
---
On topic, i will feel bad. Also i used to describe why, by writing walls but i honestly give up.
---
In short.
---
The horrid balance of items and classes made vanilla what it was, what apparently many people want back, including me. It made the content relevant throughout it's life.
---
New content from people with different vision has the chance to cause ToC/IC dungeon effect, effectively removing 80+% of the previous content.
---
And most important of all, EVERYONE has an opinion, in which they describe how it will help the game. Guess where the problem is hidden.
---
They have basically 2 main stats stamina and (strength/agility/intellect) depending in your spec, and 2 out of 4 available secondary stats (mastery/crit/haste/versatility). So if you are not minmaxing just to clear normal raids its totally enough to just look for an item that has a higher item level.
---
&gt;guessing the modern server architecture and improvements during the last 13 years have eliminated the "pressing X repeatedly"-bug. 
---
NO CHANGES
---
&gt;... by people kicking from parties when I say "I am ret." or decline me etc. 
---
You can be SURE ppl will decline you based on being retri.
---
Herbalism, mining. Easy. Hold on to your mats if you go for it though. Early on, nobody will have gold to sink into the professions - it's very expensive to level them, even if you have corresponding gathering profession to go along with them. Hell, you can't even afford spells sometimes, everything will be grossly underpriced. Bank them on level 1 alts and pump them into AH once economy stabilizes a bit, maybe a month or two down the line when everyone will be focusing on proffesions after reaching 60.
---
My boat rn.
---
I'm not trying hard to grind up to 60, because that WOULD be a waste on a pserver. 
---
Just learning how to grind efficiently, get a feel for how my new old class works a little better, and doing some dungeons with my buddies for shits and gigs.
---
Isn't this the guild that Alexusensual was in?

**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
❗ **ABOUT US:** ❗ 
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;:**
---
🏁 **WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?** 🏁
---
\- While our main goal is to be efficiently and effectively clearing bosses in raids, our goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being experienced with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter (read up, watch a video, ask questions).
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
📐 **WHAT IS EXPECTED?** 📐 
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Have the desire to coordinate with other members, and have a good time!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, have fun and be excellent!
---
📆 **WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?** 📆 
---
\- We will be raiding twice a week; **Wednesday** and **Thursday**.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST.**
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST.**
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
 ❓ **OTHER FAQ's:** ❓ 
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we have 115 members.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
Our goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. We've taken our years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. Please reach out via a direct message through the reddit forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

If you are dual wielding and your enemy dodges, can you weapon swap to 2H and still retain the ability to use overpower?
---
You and many others, but if the game doesn't have enough players, it will split the community, effectively killing all three.
---
A brand new dead horse is more satisfying to beat than an old one.
---
Born with Original Sim should fit?
---
We're like edging into bigotry here, my dude. You asked a question and you have a whole thread of people giving you the answer, and you're responding, "No that doesn't agree with my preconceived prejudices about casual players."  
---
Casual gameplay is namely about your pacing and the level of investment (time, effort) you're willing/able to put in. I would definitely consider someone who plays Candy Crush 20 hours a week and has put in the investment to grow and get good scores to be more hardcore than someone who plays Dark Souls for 10 hours a week and dicks around in undead burg with the drake sword. Context matters a lot.  
---
You seem to think that easy = casual and hard = hardcore, but it's not that simple. Even the hardest of games, you can play casually, slowly get better at it, and eventually beat it, and that can be a super fun and rewarding experience. Even the easiest of games, something like mario, can be one of the most hardcore games if you dedicate a ton of time to it and do speed runs, and that can be fulfilling for a hardcore player.  
---
The word casual isn't simply short-hand for shitty entitled players, and using it that way will make you seem like a dick to people who consider themselves casual players. A casual is just someone who plays casually, \*sometimes\* that means they can't invest the time to get incredibly skilled, but it has nothing to do with being entitled and wanting everything for free.
---
Gross.
---
That is the issue, it was a thing with the old client, from what I understand It didn't go well on the demo which leads me to believe it wouldn't be the same way as it was in vanilla, the demo is much closer in client to what we are going to have.
---
Wow what a such help ! Thx a lot dude, your advices may help me a lot !

Hardiness and wotf r borderline overpowered. Dont know about pala strenghts in pvp tho explain pls

**&lt;CREW&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English**
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere.
---
We are currently 58 members in the CREW. 
---
For raiding, we are currently ONLY recruiting: Warlock, Resto Shaman and a Warrior (main) Tank.
---
We are also absolutely looking for socials/non-raiders!
---
* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace.
---
* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months).
---
* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server.
---
* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
**Core values**
---
* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
* Common sense and patience.
---
* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.
---
**Raid Schedule** (*Preliminary*)
---
2 raid days: Thursday and Sunday 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET).
---
If you are interested or have any questions please send me a message and we’ll talk:
---
Discord: Sindrex#4881
---
Thanks
---
What an exhausting experience that game was. People were just so brutal sometimes.
---
Yes that's exactly how. Esfand for example, he knows a ton of people and got raiding spots thanks to it. If you're a known guy on your realm and knows you have a safe raiding spot in your guild then go for it.
---
But play whatever you feel like, you're very strong in pvp though.
---
I don’t think there will be world pvp the first two weeks of classic &lt;.&lt; at least in elwynn and starting zones like that? I presume killing will only start when people start meeting in contested zones
---
Nah. There will be so many ragequit moments when you're getting ganked over and over again. I'll happily log for the evening and find something else.
---
Sounds like a bad idea, like splitting the community and eventually causing "We want classic" all over again. Voting is biased.
---
&lt;Imperia&gt;   [EU - A - PvP]

**Imperia:**
---
We are a  newly formed Swedish guild. Many of our members have never experienced classic and are going in blind. Our main focus is to have a chill atmosphere and to have fun. With that said, we still want to progress through raids and experience the PvP of vanilla.
---
**Raid information:** 
---
- TBD (probably one main day and an optional day of 3-4 hours of raiding)
---
- Loot: TBD
---
- Every class/spec is allowed
---
- Every class/role is needed
---
- While we are here to have fun, we expect you to take raids seriously.
---
- Still in need of Officers and a Raid Leader!
---
**What we can offer you:**
---
- A friendly and chill environment
---

This is why pace is so important. If the pace is too quick, reading quests and knowing context feel like a burden(retail) but when the pace is slow and you take it all in anyway..... then it feels more like an enrichment and an explanation for things you cant help but notice.
---
Fists are viable-ish but they arent great. Definitely not as good as the laternatives. Main reasons being weapon skill and talent spec.
---
I don't have the time to respond to your paragraphs with paragraphs, so fine. I'm a bigot and filthy casuals are not worthy to play muh classic WoW. Let's just leave it at that.
---
kinda. its been so long since they announced and i'm getting impatient. at least its only a few months away!
---
Change it up! You can always make a hunter alt to relive the glory days. If you’ve taken hunter to 60 twice already, I feel like it would be more interesting to experience it from a fresh perspective.
---
If that video was supposed to be ironic, I’m down
---
Dude.... We got 2 ashbringers before we were done with 1 Atiesh. RNG is super RNG. I feel bad you didn't get one for eight months. That's a bit ridiculous! =(
---
They did in their quarter something something for stakeholders what it's not called with nice words. They stopped in 2015. At that point it was just under 5 million subs (from official source).
---
This is an interesting thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/ where you can see a well done estimation from other data.
---
Also, a popular addon found how to see subscriptions from Blizzards API, and noted it was a bit over 3 million at BFA launch and was now down to 1.7 million few months ago.
---
I hit one year played on my warlock in vanilla right around the 2 year anniversary of launch.
---
The cookie cuter spec for sword is roughly this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0efoxZMhqbbVzxfo
---
with dagger is almost a couple of changes to account for not using evis and using daggers instead.
---
Swords and dagger is close and the better option depends a lot on gear. For horde swords is practically bis no matter what due to windfury. On ally if you are human then swords is BiS, if not, then generally dagger is better.
---
For PVP there's 2 sub specs that is generally used. Hemo rogue which is any slow MH, and dagger sub. 
---
Cookie cutter sub: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebkxzbZhZxMe0chRo
---
Cookie cutter sub rogue:https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGxbRxzZGcZVMjcc0k
---
There's some variations on both generally just going imp sprint over coldblood for WSG since imp sprint is really important vs killing flagcarriers.
---
Sure it is, perfectly healthy! I am just being dramatic. Give us a release date!
---
Elemental as DPS does not work well in raids, since in molten core the majority of mobs and bosses are either immune or highly resistant towards nature spells. 
---
Same applies to BWL but to a somewhat lesser extent, while other problems (like mana) arise. 
---
You can get in a casual guild as a PVP 30/0/21 Elemental shaman but most likely you are going to heal in this spec even in casual environment, because your damage spells doing half of the damage they should and draining your mana pool very quickly is not fun at all.
---
I got into a big argument with a friend who defended LFR because it lets the casual player see the co tent they wouldn’t get to see and what’s so bad about that, huh? Letting the casual player experience what the hardcore player has worked hard to achieve? Nah all the hardcore player wants is loot and achievements! 
---
Sorry, I think you should have to put effort into killing a raid boss and it should t be handed to you while you afk. 
---
Fuckin raid finder.
---
I love you.
---
I love you both
---
If you guys could just wait a minute while I get to a safe distance, that would be great.
---
sure... in Retail.  
---
not in Classic WoW  
---
k thx bye
---
So what happens if we have another article in this subreddit about something that might happen in the future...
---
Druid 0/30/21 is a great spec to both PvP heal and 5 man tank at the same time. You will need 2 different wardrobes though.
---
Hey I've got a question, what were some cool items in classic that casters(or warlocks in particular) could get? I never played vanilla WoW (other than a free trial at my cousins up to level 4 lol) but am looking forward to it. Torn between warrior and warlock so I'm interested to know what cool things I could look forward to having drop on lock as opposed to warrior. Probably won't have time for 2 characters.
---
People will start to cry about things they don't like and blizzard will turn it into shit. It's a RE-release, it can't kill anything.
---
The problem is back when blizzard suddenly decided to change a design point of view that constantly caused their game to grow.
---
A new game with vanilla-TBC design from blizz may very well "kill" retail, but not an Re-release.
---
What you're looking for is /r/minecraft
---
I think I will roll on a PvE server. Since once BGs are added there will not be much world PvP other then ganking.
---
Too bad it’s hot garbage :/ that plot armor in episode 3 was so thick I couldn’t even enjoy watching it. It’s not a GRRM story if every main character miraculously escapes certain death 15 times in one episode, and actions have no consequences.
---
Also the combat became Diablo 3 in WoW perspective. Just aoe grinding everything down. In Vanilla on the other hand, each single mob is a fight on it's own (at least while leveling).
---
Sounds like a dumb idea for classic.
---
They tried something like that in retail. It was called garrisons
---
Be flexible and have a set of Resto gear in case you are asked to heal. I've seen Elementals with exceptional gear (AQ/Warlord) who can really cause some damage, but it will take quite a while to get that kind of gear if you play casually. If you come in as a DPS from the beginning, it will be easier for a guild to accept you as a player who wants to DPS rather than heal.
---
OK :-)
---
&gt;storytelling
---
I disagree with you, a spoonfeeding story with the cutscenes and nonsense writing with a shitton of bank spots unanswered because "It was in a book" is so much worse than stories told back in a day with simple /e commands and /say from NPCs. As well as focusing on the story as a singleplayer experience in MMO game.
---
Now, watch all these vanilla experts complain in a couple of months, how BLIZZARD got it wrong, and /sit was suppose to be a thing in vanilla.
---
I swear man, i've played on 3 private servers since classic was announced, and they are similar, but no where near 100% accurate on most things. It's stuff like this, some mobs (most mobs) feel very WEAK compared to my memory (I solo'd hogger ffs, never was able to do that at appropriate lvl), the world buffs that you would rarely have in vanilla, and constantly have in private servers, ore spawns that where never there in vanilla, and spawns that i remember missing etc. None of them got it all right. (but most got very close)
---
OG spellbatching cycles should help with performance as well, but it's hard to say how much of an increase that will be.
---
Elemental is really really bad, worse than all the other "meme specs".
---
You want to go elesesto like @renegar86 suggested.
---
What if I told you that the proceeds from Classic will go back into retail, because retail is classic and classic is retail?
---
Hmm i couldnt find anything about blizz confirming sub numbers since early lich king when they were above 10million. Going by that though you are most likely right, its 8 million from their peak they lost.
---
Other then that, everything else is basically guess work like i said. Unless blizz officially says here are our sub numbers i doubt we will know exactly. Its probably in the same ballpark tho
---
BFA is not a bad game, with that said it is no longer the WoW we grew up playing.  It is a guided RPG that if you detour from the path the devs have provided you will hit a wall and no longer be able to continue.  There is more grinding in BFA (cough\* Island Expeditions) than any of the Diablo games which are designed to be straight up grinds.
---
I personally hate how combat specs feel while levelling, so I level sub anyway.  It might take a little longer, but I enjoy it more.  You'll manage either way.  
---
After that... well, go look at  [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19703/lucifrons-curse](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19703/lucifrons-curse) and you should be able to figure out which ability you won't have enough energy to cast at all against the first boss of MC.
---
As far as money... I made quite a lot selling the junkboxes to other rogues for Ravenholdt reputation (on top of the pickpocket money from just getting them).  I usually snuck around BRD/LBRS for that.
---
What about that real popular Lost My Walrus one though?
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18842
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=17103
---
These are 2 very very good caster weapons that drop in MC and anyone who gets their hands on them early should count their lucky stars.
---
Skynet was a mistake
---
TF requires you to delve into BWL fairly deeply. Both Hand and TF require crafting materials. And guilds would help provide materials for both, if they'd provide for one. The thought that one is more important than the other is only logical in regards to functionality within a raid, but not in how much a guildmate matters. 
---
The only reasonably difficult thing to gather for the hammer is the ingots. And by the time you kill rag to get the eye drop, which is bad but not THAT bad, you've got PLENTY of ingots.
---
Given your user name, this is THE guild for you.
---
I'd bet you're the GM aren't you ? :p
---
&gt; You might say: dude, you have to prioritize whatever stat is best on your character if you want to finish heroic or mythic level raid.
---
That's not exactly right. For most specializations you don't want to prioritize anything but ilvl. And if you want to prioritize anything, it means that game designers failed and probably will nerf offending stat in the future.
---
The only non-trivial slots are trinkets. Well, rings might be used too, because they lack main stat, but the difference will be pretty much non-existent.
---
So it's not only your thoughts. That's what developers wanted: you don't have to choose.
---
Of course if you have few items with the same ilvl, you'll need to choose. But with titanforging everywhere it's not very often. And even in those cases the choice does not really matter, because stats are so close in their weights, that difference will be negligible.
---
Thank god I'm at work and couldn't watch with the sound !
---
When it comes to Legion to BFA I feel their biggest mistake was the Azerite system.  They threw away the entire artifact system and started a new azerite system; they created a ton of more work for themselves by not using content that the community was happy with to give them new shit that no one was happy with.
---
True but the point still stands. That \~80% is not worth the hassle for the \~20% organic open world PvP skirmishes. Once BGs start, serious rankers will go grind BGs.
---
The storytelling might be better, but the story itself went to shit after Wrath. And even during WotLK the writting wasn't really great.
---
I'm afrait of early release of serverchange, factionchange 
---
And ofcourse the worce case scenario stuff like
---
Name change
---
Wow token
---
Character boosts
---
Store mount
---
Stuff that should never be in classic...
---
I think the community share a portion of the blame for what the game has become, they've always eaten up every bit of convenience they can get without being able to see how it affects the bigger picture, and it's ultimately what's led us to where we are now. That's not to excuse Blizzard of anything they've done, but I think a lot could have been averted if the community had been more aware of how things were falling apart around them.
---
It says everything about the modern WoW community that one of the biggest controversies this expansion was the removal of a few portals, like the game is so bad at its core right now, but apparently one of the worse things Blizzard has done is making farming transmogs a bit less convenient. These are the type of players the game is cattered towards now.
---
Funny thing is I can name dozens of Diablo Legendaries. 
---
I can't name a single actually unique weapon in World of Warcraft since Cataclysm. It's super sad. Part of that is I haven't really played as much since back then, but honestly I still remember Gurthalak because it was *fucking sick*. (Even though cata was trash)
---
In the hunter tree, bestial wrath requires 30 points but in your calculator you can pick bestial wrath after spending only 25 points.
---
You're talking about clinical addiction, which is above my pay grade as some guy on reddit. I'm talking about being mature enough not to play wow all the time.
---
Wrong sub. Please remove this post.
---
I obviously disagree so without reasoning your comment is useless.
---
Combat does not have to be complex in RPG. Quite the opposite: RPG is just a paper with numbers, like you hit boss with 35 damage, boss hit you with 200 damage, you got healed for 250 damage. So complex combat is another non-RPG element in WoW.
---
Yeah for about 3 seconds. That Gen Z instant gratification syndrome tho.
---
I liked Garrisons, the building aspect of it was fun for me, and it had it's shortcomings yeah(mainly timed follower missions that you don't do anything with).  
---
It could have been so much better, with more focus on what Warcraft 3 was instead of a mobile mini-game.  
---
Also, I would not like to see that in Classic. If I want to play a city builder, I hop on to some other game, not WoW.
---
I mean, carrying is definitely possible in League even if you just shot call for your team, calling it a coin flip is a little extreme. But if losing one game when 8/1 is enough to make you quit then I’m sure it wasn’t the game for you anyway.
---
As horde I really didn’t feel like I had to deal with fear all that often as opposed to stuns. Not sure how alliance felt, but I played on launch day and grinded to rank 13 and stuns bothered me much more than the small amount of times I had alliance fearing me. The amount of classes fearing you is so much less, especially as horde since alliance has less warlocks.
---
Also, while I usually don’t do this, I hope you’re not just downvoting me for my opinion as I’ve not downvoted a single thing you’ve posted. Everyone is welcome to their opinion, and I do see merit in WotF. Trust me, it’s still a hard choice for me as I like the thought of having a free trinket slot in PvP.
---
LOL
---
I just hope that we don't have to deal with it too nad in classic
---
Why do you think that this is not the case? It's obvious that they will open new servers periodically.
---
Not a good idea imo, there's a reason you have never gone past 40.  
---
  Restarting on vanilla really sucks, and gets worse the higher you go and even worse if you're changing faction.     
---
  You have to either delete the alliance character or move to another realm, you lose all the people you met on the way and have to start all over again, on top of losing the days/weeks/months it took to get to that level.   
---
  And if you planned on taking it relately fast paced, you're now stuck right behind the curve or in the lower end of it and have a shitton of people everywhere.
---
You don’t need to worry about BiS until endgame, the only reason you don’t see this in retail is because they turned it into one big slot machine fest so that you don’t know where your next piece loot is coming from. 
---
Having your armour being summarised by a single number means that you don’t have to do that estimation or make any trade offs yourself. (One big criticism at the start of BFA was also that iLvL wasn’t even always accurate, undermining the whole point to begin with. Which is bad design.) 
---
It’s a symbol with a lot of what’s wrong with retail, Blizzard trying to do make a lot of choices for the players because they don’t trust players to get involved on this level. 
---
I’m sorry, but all these design choices are to retain less engaged players. Anyone still playing has a hole in the head.
---
If you can look back and see the time you had ingame give you any joy or meaning. Then its worth it, then its not wasted time. Did i end a relationship because i played to much wow? yes, but looking back at it it would have happened anyway. Do i still need to do my usual choires as work/clean/eat etc.? yes, but i will also play a shitload of wow because i really really really enjoy the progress. I had 300 days played on my hunter in vanilla alone, then about 100 on a warrior and i dont even want to count the wotlk times. I have 5500 hours of dota 2 aswell, but thats spread across so many years. I also have about 500 hours played on private servers total. But yea, i dont have children and all that other stuff that eats up time for others. I do have a GF thou, she takes alof of time.
---
Yeah a couple nights ago. It's getting bad.
---
Will I get 3 times xp if I invite a friend? :P
---
Retail is less than 2 million subs according to leaks. If that's true then Classic has a very good shot of coming close or even surpassing that count. Nostalrius alone had around 150k active players before it was shut down. If it actually happens then Blizzards most likely moves are new progressive expansion realms and bringing gameplay closer to Classic in the next retail expansion.
---
**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent auction, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.
---
https://discord.gg/qN9ywMy
---
I wish...that was WotLK with massive cleave dmg and lolers difficulty. That xpac was the beginning of the end but man was the pure combat and number explosions a ton of fun.
---
2?  That already seems low for a Druid!
---
Great idea. They should add the building system from Fortnite 👌
---
How is it the wrong sub, it's about classic
---
Garrisons were just so half-assed. They literally went for minimal effort design. We couldn't even place buildings in custom locations; they were all pre-designated for us. But yeah, it could have been great - if Blizzard gave a shit about quality.
---
Great!
---
You will get your chance. Maybe even this year.
---
I think it is all about how you define "Casual" do you define it as easy, as easy to get into, easy to Play if you only have a couple of minutes everyday?
---
Give us the clear Definition you have and we can tell you if that Definition fits the one of Asmon etc. :D
---
Seen some warriors on private servers and on [legacyplayers.com](https://legacyplayers.com) loggs use them, and ive seen some in videos. Dont think they are BIS as alot of ppl mention in this thread but guess they are good-ish
---
they'll have to mess it up pretty bad for classic to not outshine retail
---
Nope.
---
Could always try prot paladin weirdness with holy shield and then 20 points in holy. You gimp yourself a little bit on healing but any melee class that tries to get on you just dies.
---
That one is my favourite as well! The high grass gives me goosebumps. Beautiful.
---
Don't kid yourself.   [https://www.wowhead.com/item=828/small-blue-pouch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=828/small-blue-pouch) 
---
:)
---
Don't need one. Look at eq. They still have a high concurrent player count and active sub count. It's a proven model and since blizzard doesn't have to give up retail it makes full business sense. Downvote all you want but if you understand business then you'll see that's exactly what they are going to do.
---
Item lvl 25
---
I thought about going PVE but then i read a comment/thread discussing that it would get immensly boring at lvl 60 without any kind of excitment running to raid, herb, mine, invade, random ganks. I think i would get boored and the whole faction war would just be non-existent. It would feel more like a job where you run to raid and thats it. So ill be playing a PVP server.
---
If you are not trying to speed level then I would definitely advise leveling with professions. Keeping your skill level up to date with your current level will help break up some of the monotony of leveling and you will get lots of gear upgrades if you’re doing a crafting prof.
---
Because people cant make proper polls it seems.
---
Considering classic hasn’t been released yet, isn’t everything in this sub for the future? It’s better than another shitty clickbait youtube karma farming “guide”.
---
&gt;People don't wanna hear this, but that kind of elitist short-sighted bullshit is going to follow us into Classic.
---
I'm a little worried about this but honestly I think it just comes down to people who are aware of the problem actively working against it. 
---
It's a culture problem, if you can get your entire group of friends to actively reject the attitude of googling BiS and optimal strats for everything and letting themselves have fun, then encourage them to do the same, it will spread. 
---
I actually did it for a while in Legion by intentionally not inviting the highest ilevel for my mythic+s and it worked for my group. I think it is just a part of taking your gaming time less seriously as a whole
---
It's like diablo speed rifts same formula as mythic 5 mans. Its rushed action. You are correct it is NOT an rpg. Gearscore is bullshit. Oh look this item is higher up. Right click equip. No brain power or crafting your char.
---
No, they are separate install folders inside the main World of Warcraft folder: _retail_,  _ptr_, and _classic_.
---
Jesus, It's really easy to PM.  They dont want to share responsibility for a shutdown and that's reasonable.
---
I think Blizzard is smart, I think activision are a pack of fucks. But even activision knows the backbone of the actual vanilla community and players are a group of people escaping the current game, I like to think they’re not actually stupid enough to kill their vanilla servers this way.
---
Then again, look at retail. They just might be fucking stupid enough to do it.
---
Shut up you muppet
---
"I think the community share a portion of the blame for what the game has become,"
---
ilevel was introduced because of an addon- gearscore that people used to completely exclude each other from groups - the geascore era was dogshit - ilevel isnt much better either tbh.
---
At least m.io is performance based though and in a venue where you're 20% of the group. A score of X is a way better indicator that player is performing at a level of X and has experience with it. Gear score had almost no correlation with performance or skill because you were 1 in 25 and there were many avenues to pad the score.
---
Agreed. I’m shocked fucking adventure quest doesn’t have more players than retail right now.
---
The real answer is that nobody actually good is making guides they are busy raiding on pservers. People who make guides and videos mostly just copy sources from private servers forums and post them on youtube as a 10 minute video.
---
Laughs in Divine Intervention.
---
lol found the scrub
---
All I can remember from vanilla is the Alliance, Horde and Neutral (goblin) auction houses. Can't recall any Black Market.
---
At least you could pick which node you want to build which building. Some games don't even let you do that...but that's where Garrisons exhausts it's 'good' parts for me. it is really minimal effort, and I just wish/hoped that they would have been done something better with it....oh well.  
---
Either way, no thanks for Classic Garrisons....they wanted to do Housing originally, and I guess Garrisons was their way of doing it later on...but god no, we don't want extra contents in Classic(I don't at least.)
---
I feel that. But as someone who recently got into high end PvE on retail (and also raided in TBC) I can say for sure that raids are probably the one thing that has gotten consistently better over time.
---
BoD is a seriously awesome raid, and tackling the harder fights with your guildies, smashing your face into a wall and finally killing the boss after who knows how many pulls, is a really great feeling.
---
Also when you fail, it feels like you failed because you didn't play well. Progression feels meaningful when you fix your mistakes as a team and can feel "okay, we got that mechanic down pat now".

&gt; People hate it saying it's a bad game. It really isn't. It's just so different

Yes, it's completely different from what it once was, hence why we hate it.

Kind of like how Banjo Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts was hated for the same reason. It's not a bad game.....it's just a really fucking bad Banjo Kazooie game because it's so radically different that it's not even Banjo Kazooie anymore.
---
And in the same vein, BFA/Retail are so radically different from vanilla that it's not an MMORPG anymore, it's closer to a 3rd person shooter lobby game with some very light RPG elements.
---
I think what you’re missing is that there’s a lot of other contextual elements that go along with the formatting. Sure, when play DND and all you have is a dungeon master and a pen and paper you don’t wanna be doing complex maths on the spot (or maybe you do, I won’t tell you how to have fun). 
---
But when you’re actually sat there doing that, everything moves a lot more slowly. Everything is in your head, the dungeon master uses clever narratives to set the scene and create and atmosphere and you are much less restricted. The only limits are your imagination. Every single encounter can be unique.
---
When you’re playing on the computer and you simplify it to ‘hit boss 35’ ‘boss heals 250’ , it just doesn’t feel the same. You’re just pushing buttons. There’s no narrative, no atmosphere, and no suspense waiting for the dice roll.
---
It’s just two completely different formats. Of course they’re different and the pc subsisted the absence of suspense, creativity and unique encounters with more complicated combat.
---
I'll agree that i liked tge garrison, and it could habe been so much better...
---
But yeah, not in classic
---
The internet was a mistake
---
Ofc you can hate it, but it's still not a bad game because you dislike the changes. It's still a great game, unfortunetly they went in the wrong direction and thought the "lobby gameplay" would work with WoW.
---
It won't...
---
The moment Classic gains any momentum (despite it's watered down state), (((Ion Hazzikostas))) is going to shut it down.

**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** [H] [NA] *(Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST)*
---
🔺 **INTRO** We are known as FREE HUGS! (Yes, we give free hugs.) We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend a lot of time raiding and obtaining those sweet epic and legendary items! We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for World of Warcraft Classic.
---
🔺 **RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting any core classes such as: Priests, Mages, Hunters, Druids, DPS Warriors, Warlocks, Rogues, and Shamans. Although we are small now, we hope to grow into a powerhouse guild that prides itself on our close knit community.
---
🔺 **SCHEDULES** We will raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We will begin raiding within a reasonable amount of time after release, allowing for everyone to level/gear up. We are open to bending the raiding times based on our communities input. We will be doing dungeons, farming and pvp on our off days.
---
🔺 **OUR GOALS** We will clear all raid content through naxx at our own pace to ensure our quest for legendary items and epic quest chains. We aren’t as hardcore as some other guilds out there; we won’t be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their pve and pvp goals !
---
🔺 **BONUS** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced classic verterans in the guild with a passion for teaching all things WoW! We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious classic adventure.
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614 and I will personaly welcome you to our family!
---
BMAH is not the same as neutral AH.
---
I've been playing on pservers since Cata, so no...
---
I agree. Although I must say that running to a dungeon (UBRS/LBRS/Strat/Scholo) for the 15th time does start to get repetitive, I'm not going to lie. 
---
However, it's the player interactions you have a long the way that really make the game so much more immersive. Will there be a PvP slaughterfest outside of the dungeon as you're trying to walk in? Will there be some random person trying to sell you 12 slot bags at a 50% discount on the path to the dungeon?  Will you befriend a complete stranger the moment you land at the closest FP and travel to the dungeon together, even though you're in different groups?
---
I've had countless encounters with complete strangers on my way to, or just outside of dungeons. It truly makes it feel like a world, rather than what retail is now; world of queuecraft.
---
a hunter is a great class for newbies because its quite easy to level and its easy to play well. its got a big learning curve to be the best. you can get good easily, but its got a high skill ceiling. you can keep learning how to play it for a whole year. plus your pets are a lot more personal, if you liked the idea of pets i would go hunter over warlock. the hunter pet is a lot better RP wise, you have to tame it, you have to feed it, teach it skills and even name it! its a whole mini game in itself. trust me
---
Maybe it's ok to not like things and you don't have to be a dick and insult peoples intellect because they have other tastes? 
---
"Maybe you should question your intelligence, seriously"
---
"Anyone still playing has a hole in the head for not realising this"
---
"You’re a sucker for not seeing this."
---
What good does talking other people down for liking something? I don't particularly like BFA, but I'm not gonna be an ass to those people who do, the game went in a direction I don't like so I stopped paying my sub and moved on, why all the hostility?
---
The only point that this changes is the tip of the spear. The best of the best the people on the literal bleeding edge of wow trying for that world first and top 100 spot for the titles. At that point it now comes down to stats mana usage positioning and all the things that make an MMO... an RPG. Though it also comes with the drawbacks of the first thing you said. Takes no time to level up get to max gear up a character. For the people that play at that point who, for them, wow is there primary hobby, 8 hours a day playing is not hard to cover a few or more characters.
---
When i started with BFA i got to max level in in a bout 3 days and almost stopped playing right there. However,i played out my sub since i paid for it. For me, there was very few redeeming qualities to a game that in the first three expansions i probably played to my detriment. The only thing i really remember feeling at the end was, FINALLY finished this rep grind on the turtles and never have to do it again. It wasnt happy as much as it was relief i didnt have to ever speak to that faction again.
---
The only issue I see with this is that once you and your friends hit max level and start raiding (if that’s your plan) you won’t be able to craft your friends gear upgrades nearly as often with something like tailoring. If you went with something such as enchanting/alchemy you would for sure be busier since you could make potions and enchant but then you’d have to consider leveling a second character for herbalism for the alchemy.
---
As others have said though you could just level a hybrid class. If you’re not planning on hardcore min/max raiding then I’d probably recommend shadow priest priest. You could level as shadow which is a caster in the same way as mage and then if you miss healing you can always swap over to a healing spec and everyone loves priest healers so you’d be everyone’s best friend still.
---
The backbone of diablo fans were pc gamers aswell. Look how that went. Im just really scared and fear the worce.
---
I’ve been playing Dragon Age Origins (again) and it made me realize how far retail is from an RPG. I cannot wait for classic because it’s just such a traditional MMORPG, emphasis on RPG.
---
So having cinematics, events and actual storytelling is _WORSE_ than not having storytelling at all like in vanilla and TBC?
---
Thanks for writing some criticism/comparison of BfA that actually makes sense. I definitely agree with what you are saying, even though it's not a huge deal for me personally. 
---
You have basically finished the game on the "easy" difficulty setting, now it's time to do it again on "normal", and then "hard". Which is a fine system, but it's not like WoW and other MMOs used to be, that's for sure. I could write a bunch of counter-arguments for why the newer difficulty system makes content much more interesting and so on, but that's not really the point, it's about immersion into the game world. Running increasingly difficult versions of the same levels does not make you feel like you are a part of a living breathing world like WoW used to do. It's way more challenging, and requires a lot more skill and team coordination than it used to, but it does not make for good role playing.
---
I made myself quit in anticipation and to try leveling in one of the pservers. It has been amazing not stressing out trying to hit diamond. Probably my best decision this year so far.

Came here to say 0/30/21 was the way to go; you get just about everything you need for both jobs, with the only major drawback being a weak cat form.
---
&gt;Alliance is RP
---
&gt;Lok'tar ogar!
---
I know it's a stupid bias, but damn I swear it feels like those cringe RP comments are always coming from diehard horde players..
---
I raided tbc like it was a second job, 5 hour progression nights 5 days a week. Lots of things happened but I always managed to make it to the toilet lol.
---
Same. I got a holy paly at 120. doing some raids and stuff. Never talked to a single player, cleared jaina and still got no idea what I‘m doing. Will look for a guild next to try some mythic 5mans because I think the concept of rly hard heroics sounds fun (havent played active since beginning of cata).
---
PvP server haves you feeling alive! your brain is constantly thinking about if you can get ganked, you have some bad encounters, some good ones and some hilarious ones! the other faction dont just sh\*t on you, sometimes they help you and play with you, when that happens it really restores faith in humanity and its really awesome! 
---
plus if you get sh\*t on a lot, when you sh\*t on people, it feels just that much better.
---
red=dead
---
Yeah, I have to agree with the OP. Blizzard is especially haggard with stringing along players.   
---
I have really come to feel as though Activision/Blizzard is the comcast of the gaming community; the company we especially hate because they deserve it, but we deal with them anyway to get what we want.   
---
Or better yet, they're crack dealers. #crackheads #SorryNotSorry #WorldOfWarCrack #ImAddictedToo
---
&gt; but the story itself went to shit after Wrath
---
I don't really know much about Wrath story (didn't play the expansion), but it was shit before Wrath too, so maybe that was just a lucky one-off in that regard. 
---
I agree that it is pretty damn shit in BfA btw, it has cool settings, cool themes, and some cool characters (Bwonsamdi for example), but a lot of the story is terribly written.
---
I mean one set of gear for feral tanking and one for pvp healing. You could also go cat dps if you want to farm, so that would be a nice 3 for 1 specc with no need to respec ever.
---
&gt; Sorry, I think you should have to put effort into killing a raid boss and it shouldn’t be handed to you while you afk.
---
We had so many fucking people afk in MC killing bosses it was unreal, it was only the later portions of AQ40 that became a challenge when you didn't have everyone ready to go.
---
My dear friend.
---
After tryharding Ret for the entirety of vanilla wow and after tryharding Ret on almost every major Pserver, I came to the heartwrenching conclusion that Ret is indeed one very big meme.
---
From not knowing if your next melee swing will do 100 or 2000 damage, to having to frustrate your fellow warriors by rolling on warrior gear, Ret has shown us time and time again that it's a subpar spec. 
---
Even if you would be decked out in 5/5 t2.5 and 3/8 t2 and have sulfuras, any horde player with one quarter of a brain will just CC/kite you to death, while you my friend are reduced to an auto attacking mob.
---
Sure you get 1 bubble, but good horde players dont give a shit about your bubble. They just reset the fight to own you harder.
---
Also good luck spamming that R1 SoC while shaman LMOAPURGES your precious buffs.
---
Healing your teammates? Get OOmed faster than a moonkin spamming max rank moonfire. Also enemy mage gonna see these sexy glowing hands and counterspell your shit. Reducing you to one pretty geared auto attacking mob.
---
Just my 2 sous noirs
---
You could at least say thanks for caring enough about vanilla and actually pushing blizzard to make it. I'm guessing you thing pservers had nothing to do with classics announcement.
---
So much this. I'd certainly get set on it with 6 months of free time.
---
True, but at the same time the score is an aggregate of your best keys. If you don't do some dungeons because they don't drop loot you're looking for your overall score suffers, and people don't really look at how you have performed in the dungeon at hand. A problem I faced gearing up at the start of BFA
---
Me and 3-4 friends will be looking for an eastern PVP guild on a pvp server. We all work day jobs so essentially during the week will be available 5-9pm weekdays and whenever on weekends. Let me know if your guild has an opening! We’re all extremely respectful and pc (not really sjw tho)
---
I had a few issues with the logic around resetting higher talents when reducing low levels so I only allowed talents to be removed at the highest tier. I know it's not ideal and it looks like this is a common problem people are having so will take another look, cheers!
---
Jaina is the current baddie? Hmm..
---
" I know of scholomance but im curious if there are other places ! " but thanks
---
All that stuff is ALREADY CONFIRMED to be in Classic by the way.
---
Stay on private servers, don't give them your money.
---
I mean, BFA has major problems that have nothing to do with the differing design philosophy. It IS a bad expansion even if you enjoy the modern style. 
---
The Azerite system was dull, horribly designed, and clearly had no attempt made at balance. Warfronts and Island Expeditions are a cornerstone of the expansion, but incredibly boring. Many classes got considerably clunkier to play vs. Legion. No new spells or talents past 100. The storyline is really dumb. Tier sets removed. Professions are a joke.
---
It's an expansion that seems like it was rushed out the door 6 months too early, at least.
---
My main complaint is that the whole endgame should not be condensed into five zones. (+Kara)
---
I'm having a great time on retail. Been playing wow on and off since day 1. Currently i410 and loving the game. The internet is always going to be overly critical.
---
Yeah ideally there is only sharding to alieviate 400+ people in north shore abbey all competing for the same wolf and kobold spawns.
---
By the time people are finishing N. Barrens, Loch Modan, westfall people should be spread enough that leveling 1-2 shouldn’t take an hour.
---
I agree
---
Very known topic but not very known routes, but I've come across these in my researching
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRiJxY2qRCA
---
Path guides to get you to 1-4/1-5 for most races and immediately sets you ahead within an hour, humans apparently are 30 mins exploration exp to 5. This is my go to for launch, going to learn the route just incase dynamic spawns/sharding unfortunately show up. While people are still fighting over wolves/cats/etc you'll be in the next hub. YMMV depending on class as you wont have any gear/abilities so I  assume for example a warrior may struggle a bit but either way.
---
is there any practical use for karazhan in vanilla to enter it i remember people glitching inside it in prepatch BC
---
Got source? Im 99.9% sure it has not been confirmed.
---
exploration is a meme, questing in group is best for early, and just making sure you are doing highest possible level quests.
---
Nice rant go smoke another bowl of meth
---
Blizzard hasn’t released their specific plans. But starting the non contested zones for a week makes sense.
---
Don’t shard red ridge, don’t shard stormwind. But shard Elwynn and Westfall for a week.
---
I would say four.
---
1 Resto-Set for PvE, 1 Bear-Set for tanking, Max Int and Stam for HOTW in PvP and Cat-Gear of course for farming.
---
You can do about anything in the game with HOTW and those Sets.
---
I don't necessarily agree with the guy you asked, but having no cinematics/events *can* be better storytelling then what WoW is doing right now. Both Dark Souls 3 and PoE have a very hands-off approach to lore; you mostly find little bits of lore on items or in the environment and have to piece together the story yourself.
---
More grinding in BFA than any dibalo games? I've had numerous level 99 characters in Diablo 2. Talk about grinding the same baal runs for 6 hours a day for a month. Or in Diablo 3, greater rift after greater rift. There is SO much more to do in wow than Diablo.
---
No it hasn't. Just stop already
---
Fair enough! It is probably the worst possible game for triggering thalassaphobia lol.
---
I honestly came here for the comments; I am sitting here laughing. Where are all the "#nochanges" "going to ruin the game" nerds that on every thread? lol
---
I've read many people who place high in max races use exploration to get the initial boost, but I've also read that many just quest with the mob, or farm outside of the starting zone. In the end it probably doesn't matter what you do as if you play enough you'll be ahead. But exploration is at least guaranteed exp.
---
10 slots
---
Did you know that gearscore started as an addon and everyone became so obsessed with it that blizzard actually added it into the game. The players asked for gearscore.
---
exploration is literally just something "content creators" came up with as some secret way to get exp, it's never been useful on pservers.
---
Paladins are far and away the strongest healers in pvp vanilla. Resistance to cc, massive hps, plate gear, and Ofc pally bubble mean horde has a very hard time.
---
Yes. Waiting for the release date and trying to plan my life around it has messed my life up somewhat.
---
The best racial ever.
---
rofl good meme lad
---
Kept in touch with another Hunter Mott for awhile I think we're friends on Steam but I've lost track of most of them. Some still play in SM not as often.
---
Always make sure you're grabbing everything you need from town before heading out. Going back and forth from town is always a big drag. Skipping your trainer for a level or two is also another way to save time if you know there's nothing useful. 
---
Setting your hearth in town and doing a crap ton of quests in one go is another good tip.
---
haHAA
---
I really need focus target, and target focus the most. Then something like pfUI with autodismount
---
Yeah would suck if westfall had shards:(
---
I think the warlock staff is best right?
---
I don't know it's hard to dispute hitting level 5 with exploration/delivery quests in half an hour or so. I can't imagine there's a very very reliable way otherwise when you have 600 other people competing with you for every spawn in the 1-6 range.
---
I think thats a thing a lot of classic naysayers miss when it comes to classic excitement. People just want to play a good MMORPG again. We don't need to fly over the world, we want a world that makes use feel immersed. We don't need queue'd systems because we have social skills and can make friends/guilds. We don't need gear thrown at us and invalidated every patch because there needs to be a carrot, and pride behind getting that carrot in an MMORPG. We don't need to see everything, because we realize that there needs to be some mysticism and goals that are always a little further past what we can achieve... and no the same content but on a harder difficulty doesn't hold the same weight. I think in their quest to be inclusive they've forgotten what genre WoW is suppose to be. There's a reason they call it the MMO experience. It's not about what content is stream friendly, or can be turned into an eSport, or even making sure everyone can do everything. It's about throwing players into a pool and letting them swim around, instead of throwing them into lanes and telling them to swim laps.
---
If I unlearn a proffession, level another, then relearn the first proffession again, will my character still remember the recipes for the once  unlearned, now relearned proffession?
---
E.g i know the recipe for LW Hide of the Wild. I unlearn LW and try out tailorimg (maybe for the bop dresses). I then unlearn tailoring and learn LW again. When I level it back to 300 will i still be able to craft Hide of the wild or do i need to buy/farm/learn the recipe again?
---
Did someone say...
---
TBH, i never heard of anything like AAP in vanilla, we had stuff like questie though, wich seems similar. and without stuff like gatherer, enchantrix and some auctionhouse addon, the game was damn near impossible for new players.
---
Even heroic has a tough but fair feeling to it.  Mythic is a ballbuster to be sure.
---
Deadwind pass on Gilneas never had players there. I used to hang out in the tower structure next to the main structure and pretend that was my Warrior's home because fuck blizz not having any form of player housing.
---
But practical use? You can farm cloth from the ogres in the area.
---
Can you link your character's armory page? I'd like to see this player clearing Jaina with no idea what they are doing.
---
That's not oldskewl tho, that's from 2014 tsk
---
 Hand of Rag - No question for this Pally. One of the few that I have never been able to land. Although, I watched it go to a warrior in vanilla  and then he stopped using it within 2 weeks
---
Wait, Jaina dies?
---
&gt; since I did a ton of carry runs for my not amazing players
---
This right here. Vanilla dungeons weren't that hard. You could always bring 1 or 2 people who didn't know what to do. Or 5 in the case of 10 man raiding strat/scholo.
---
Source? Source? Source?
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
Source?
---
A source. I need a source.
---
Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.
---
No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.
---
You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.
---
Do you have a degree in that field?
---
A college degree? In that field?
---
Then your arguments are invalid.
---
No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.
---
Correlation does not equal causation.
---
CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.
---
You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.
---
Nope, still haven't.
---
I just looked through all 308 pages of your user history, figures I'm debating a glormpf supporter. A moron.
---
&gt; As far as money... I made quite a lot selling the junkboxes to other rogues for Ravenholdt reputation
---
Ravenholdt rep has no rewards associated with it right? Why would someone grind that rep?
---
We'll have our heigan at least for that 😉
---
holy shit i just realized it's young jeff
---
there where guilds like that in vanilla too though. 1 or 2 per faction per server i think. But you had tons of more social options.
---
I had a dream that I got fired from my job for no-show.  Does that count?  It's kinda wow-related.
---
Been playing league for 7 years man. Hit diamond 3 in season 4 and diamond 5 in season 5... been plat ever since. I love this game but it’s a brutal ride of ups and downs. I’ve poured all I had in to this game but it’s time to set it aside now. I don’t want to play it anymore. 
---
Words just can’t express how happy I am to delve into Azeroth once again!
---
man that burn was quick ;o
---
One thing both games did right was making you wait for boats/zepplins/shuttles.
---
This so much! And also I'd add that the new loot system feels just like opening loot boxes. Sure they are dropped by bosses (for now) but they feel cheap and very very random!
---
One of the worst mistakes I see from first time rogues while leveling is that they misunderstand why they should use a slow MH and fast OH weapon. They just go on a forum and read that and say "ok" and stick to it. 
---
The slow MH is used because slower weapons have a higher base damage per attack *when compared to weapons of a similar level*. All of your instant attack abilities (sinister strike, backstab, etc.) don't care about attack speed and apply additional damage to your weapon so you want the weapon to do the most damage per swing to maximize that extra damage. The thing new rogues don't pay attention to is that it's the weapon damage that actually matters, not the speed. When you're 60 and you're looking at level 60 items then the slower weapon will always deal the higher damage so it's easy to just follow the rules. 
---
When you're leveling is very feasible you'll come across a situation where you're using a 2.6 speed weapon in your MH that does say 15-20 damage and you come across a nice new weapon that's 2.2 speed but does 20-25 damage. I've seen countless newer rogues just take that 2.2 weapon and throw it on there OH cause it's faster. This is a *huge* mistake as not only would that weapon deal more damage on instant abilities, it would also deal more damage on white hits and deal that damage faster, meaning it would be a massive upgrade in your MH. 
---
Similarly, for OH you want faster for more instant poison procs as it's a 20% chance per swing, so more swings means more procs. But, you don't have poisons early, so your OH should just be the highest dps weapon you can find. And even after you have poisons, don't forego an OH weapon that is much higher dps than your current weapon just because it's slower. You have to weigh how much less procs you'd get vs the dps increase. 
---
If all this seems "no duh" I apologize. I've just seen so many newer rogues make the simple mistakes while leveling that really gimps their damage output.
---
Believe it or not, shadow meld is fairly useful. If you need to eat and drink in a battle, or force melee to come at you because they can’t target, and ambushing when defending
---
and ?
---
I sit after every fight out of habit from playing Dark Age of Camelot for so long.
---
Level a shadow priest, with alch and herbalism!
---
If you need to talk to people they will need to learn to be nice. Or all the "gogogo" people will cluster around each other. Either way, let's hope for the best.
---
As long as you're a warm body that knows how to CC your icon and slow dps for threat then you're probably golden. Wipes dont lose gear, just burn a little time. The cost for learning is lower, while the rewards are even more satisfying because it's the piece you want not the lowest roll of forge piece you want.
---
Where did you read that faction change will be in Classic?
---
Ahhhh... I wanted to play an UD WL (mainly due to forsaken animations), but I completely forgot about the orc stunresist. Fuck, I don't want to be an orc :&lt;
---
Although I guess female orc does look kind of okay...
---
The way they've done it in Vanilla and TBC and current wow, especially post WoD - yes.
---
Good point. I've kept up with the BFA storyline and there is good stuff in the storytelling within leveling zones. Unfortunately the player is in and out of there within a few hours so none of it can really ferment into something memorable.
---
Alliance is the easy side with balance issues in AV that gives Alliance a massive advantage. Alliance also has the "pretty" races so Alliance also be over populated because nobody wants to play the "ugly" Horde races.
---
Reckoning will just give you some extra swings every once in a while when you really get crit. It's still a good talent, just not exploitable to have happen whenever you want. Prot is still good for AOE leveling, but single target you're probably better off with Ret.
---
Does it matter? It will just change the rate of the exchange. But if there's a market for it (and there is), it will happen.
---
Yeah, you guys are gonna get fucken SMOKED HARD in black rock mountain for months lol
---
It started with e-sports. People wanted to make WoW more competitive. With e-sports over simplification of systems became mandatory in order to offer more inclusion. They simply wanted to allow more players the ability to compete on a comparable level. With BfA Blizzard really took it to the next level. Not only was there a complete gear reset for the expansion now they are resetting it every patch. PvP play is scaled so its more fair. Mythic + difficulty is reset per season... The game is a complete atrocity in its current state and they don't even have the capability to fix it anymore. It would literally mean creating a new game and MMORPGs as a genre are dying so there's no reason for them to even do so. WoW is a collection/dress up game now. I really wish they would just kill it off entirely.
---
No idea.  I do know at least 2 people were also grinding out bloodsail admiral, so likely they just wanted to max out all their reputations.
---
Heh

Sorry, this was removed as unrelated to Classic. Please try r/wow for modern won't discussion.

Ok, so the people that are obsessed with it are doing practice runs to get ahead if the pack so they arent competing for quest mobs.
---
Also, some people dont enjoy the leveling process and their favorite part is level 60 content.  Dont assume you play how others play.
---
At least try a gnome if you can stand it. 5% int and escape artist is sick
---
While just screwing around on pserver I was able to hit 5 within 45 minutes on undead exploring, this was just over questing. Seems to be far from a meme or being un-useful.
---
But idk...
---
Having no gold to train skills sets you behind in the long run.
---
Alright, Thanks for replying
---
&gt;  "anyone can come and do anything!"
---
Including not being on time, AFKing constantly, goofing around and all that wonderful stuff.
---
Literally none of those will be available in phase 1. Even mana igniting cord was added in a later patch (1.5) which means it wont be dropping in phase 1.  
---
Dude what xD
---
Oh I won't even get near one... Just dreaming for the sake of all my rogue brethren.
---
For real tho, what does this post have to do with Vanilla, rule #1. 
---
Are you perhaps suggesting the dev.s put in this system into the game? Why and to what purpose? Questions like adding extra content after Naxx at least makes sense, questions about "class balance" make sense too. Am I reading right that because the SWG cities were cool we should just develop that new system and drop it in our time capsule-esk game that we've clamored to have no changes for the past decade??
---
While seemingly very basic tips, I think these are things a lot of people forget from playing release. Release kind of hand-holds your way through quests giving you 3-5 to complete and making it very obvious when to return to town.
---
Schedule your time and stick to it
---
It's still ganking.  Keep up the good work.
---
I lol'd the nsfw makes it perfectly suspenseful. Ty needed that on a Monday morning.
---
Can i play pvp pala AS a shockadin hybrid spec?
---
I'm with you on pve, especially now. Since hunters are mostly brought for tranq shot or even nightfall starting aq, the dps they do doesn't really matter. It's less true early when they are the best ranged dps.
---
FWIW clearing normal Jaina is brain dead.  Heroic raids now are about the difficulty of Wrath normal raids and Mythic raid being the same as Heroic.
---
1-20 has some pretty significant imbalances that make min/maxing very attractive. For instance, having a lesser magic wand at level 5 means you will do more damage wanding than you will using spells, and having a greater magic wand at 13 means the same.
---
Which is already really weak IMO so tank/heal spec is awesome. Also stack a lot of int and stam, seems counterintuitive but it works
---
Prepare for a sad and lonely life in vanilla. Shadow priests and moonkin are outcasts.
---
Tyr's hand was a good farm spot due to the crusader enchant recipe dropping and netting you a direct 100 gold thus greatly increasing the gold/hour.
---
You can plan a route to farm larval acid and essence in EPl which is quite lucrative especially if you have herbalism and alchi to transmut the essence of undeath to essence of water.
---
BFA is in itself not a BAD game, it's just not my game anymore.
---
Agreed. Source or it didn't happen.
---
&gt; vanilla wow auction house price history  in google
---
They’re fine in 5 mans and PvP but that’s it, unless you’re the 1 raid priest for shadow vuln
---
The only "meme"-start I actually liked was the video where you take the hidden path from orc starting via water to Ratchet, grab the weapon crate in the water and take the FP's there and in XR. Then you sell the weapon for 15-25s, fly to Orgrimmar, grab skinning/cooking and bags (save around 2s) and hearth back to Valley. That leaves you with enough silver for the 2H axe in Sen'jin which lets you grind all the way up to Razor Hill, with skinning, a few bags and the lvl 4 axe.
---
Are you oke sir?
---
The Defias story from Northshire to Onyxia's Lair was a well thought out journey. I don't understand how that can be disregarded.
---
nice try makeing griefing lowbies sound like an honest thing
---
Yeah that's true, but to access this content (aka MM raid) you need to farm again and again the same MM+ content to come to the correct iLvL to even be accepted in group/guild.
---
Then grind each week for usable (same as vanilla tho). 
---
Then grind your AP, then grind your weekly island, then grind whatever it needed to be grinded.
---
True, you have to go for the slowest weapon as well. If you are hamstring kiting, which you should.
---
why is improved gouge 5/5
---
Potting in D2 would have been horrible lol, considering there were potions that instantly healed you to full and you could use them with 0 cooldown.
---
DPS in classic is mostly about setup, you'll do fine, enjoy the game.
---
The way the hitbox works on pservers is very different to retail. You can pretty much instantly get out of their hitbox after hamstringing on a pserver, whereas on retail it would take a couple seconds and you'd take a few hits in the process due to the movement/hitbox behavior of the mobs. 
---
Hamstring kiting will be possible of course, but leveling where you are jumping in and out of their hitbox on weapon swing probably won't be nearly as efficient, if possible at all.
---
I agree with you. I tried raiding in BFA and you literally have to read a monster manual before each fight and just do exactly what it says. Also, it's absurd to make people download a separate add on program to raid.
---
there are a lot of these plain talent calcs already, would prefer some stats of lvl 60's with no gear/certain gear levels and a stat planner, so for instance you can see how much the talent 'spiritual guidance' gives priests for example. to make more informed choices.
---
You laugh in an ability with 1h CD that can't be used solo
---
To be fair there are way more items now than in classic. 
---
At normal raid Gear quality you can have more than 10 viable different items per slot, most of them having the potential to have the stats you need.
---
This is more an issue of brain power and amount of stuff than anything in this scenario.
---
As a holy/disc priest, my stat priority is literally ilvl. Secondary stat is whatever except for rings. 
---
I enjoy raiding with friends but BfA is just a raid logging game. Literally fuck all else to do.
---
They're bottom tier
---
They're sharding the world, so it'll be DoA
---
In the routes I've seen you gain silver from the delivery quests, and from what i can tell it's enough for a few skills and to do repairs etc. And since you only have a few skills at that level anyways, it seems to pan out decently nice. If you really plan a route, and nail it i'm positive you'll be in the top percentile leveling wise. And I'm not even trying to be a neckbeard hitting 60 in 2 weeks, I just don't want to be questing with half the server. Gain a good lead, cruise from there.
---
Disc priest is literally just ilvl over everything. Holy priest is the same. Sure it helps to have more mastery but even 5 ilvl is going to perform better with haste and vers.
---
IT'S ALL OVER, LAWBREAKER! YOUR SPREE IS AT AN END.
---
If you dont want to watch a video for every dungeon and need just an overview, I found this to be very useful:  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quests=2.717](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quests=2.717)
---
I had a dream I finally looted the Cat’s Eye Emerald from the Boulder Lode Mine. It was a good dream
---
Most of the big pservers have had a very close to 50/50 ratio....
---
Death of master looter ruined any intent I had to continue raiding. Tried it through 8.1.5, but it's so hard to get a new group going now. No control of the loot then theres  no incentive to stick around. Trial periods in guilds dont really make sense anymore,etc.
---
possy
---
&gt; [...] and how much of your free time you spend playing WoW is entirely up to you.
---
Been there, tried that...
---
I had a dream the other day that I was a priest healer in BRD and got separated from my group. I just lost some mobs by hiding behind a wall. Not a priest skill but, /shrug it was a dream. It was in first person like it was really me and I was trying to creep my way around to find my pug.
---
How does one acquire a position like this? That sounds amazing!
---
It feels like Apex Legends
---
I'm wearing a blue helmet. Anybody see a purple helmet?
---
Fair point, but it doesn't matter. It will either work as Vanilla did, in which case my current preparation will prove beneficial, or it will work as BfA currently does, in which case i just copy over what I have in retail.
---
Because it would shatter server communities every time they open one. We've seen what happens on pservers when the FRESH rush happens. Look, I enjoy me some FRESH, but I kind of want to actually play and live on my server and not watch it become a ghost town over night. And more importantly... they've never mentioned anything about season servers on any official channels.
---
This
---
Imagine dozens of orcs and trolls running over there at the same time, all trying to get that fucking chest.
---
Hilarious
---
I got kicked by a guild because i told them you don't need a guild for anything else that mythic raid. The worst part of retail are the players.
---
It's not the worst thing you could pick. You can gouge people on the AH for the engineering items that are required for leveling quests.
---
I don’t have that much of an issue with m.io; it was a tool that let me play with people who had similar experience. 
---
The primary type of people who hate raider.io are people who want free +10 runs every week for their chest without putting in any effort/practice. There’s also dps only classes who don’t realize that groups with a tank and healer can join LFG and instantly have ~30-40 dps signed up to join. Of course good players will get turned down; I have 30-40 people signed up to come to my group :/
---
Vanilla had a lot of similarities; instead of a score you would “come to bank for inspection” or “MC geared only” or most commonly just get booted during trash or first boss after raid leader inspects your gear and sees your dps/hps. The only improvement vanilla had was that without sharding and cross faction everything your reputation was more important, so if you perform well people were more likely to friend you and invite you back since the pool of available players was smaller.
---
Spoiler alert
---
I love how some games totally play up the wide variety of approaches one has to pvp.
---
It’s like total war, is bombing the enemies command and control or industrial centers any less valid of a tactic than close air support?
---
While the above strategy has the potential to lead to Illidan like servers, completely dominated by one faction (“cause we killed them all”, as we used to say), it’s totally valid. 
---
Idk, griefing is a word made up by pansies.
---
Wpvp is not fair. It is cruel, unforgiving and often occurs when you are least prepared.
---
That’s war baby, the only fair fight is the one where all my guys come home alive.
---
Tauren it is then. Warrior will have to be my orc.
---
You can avoid corpse camping. If you don't play on a pvp server at launch you're fucking up, real talk. You're talking 60+ days out before level 60's are actively camping low level zones.
---
As you said its not an mmorpg anymore its basically just a dungeon crawler at this point.
---
I'd play to push content but thats just that, i cant see myself playing retail if i didnt want to push my character to the max to clear the hardest content
---
I couldn't agree more with that last statement.
---
If I say Ashkandi, everyone and their mother knows exactly what I'm talking about, but if I say Blade of Encroaching Death, I bet 99% has no idea.
---
You say that like it's unsurprising to hear. For cinematics: It's a video game, replicating film to do your storytelling fundamentally removes any unique storytelling advantages games have. Events exist and are emergent in the world through interactions with other players and quests in both Vanilla and TBC.
---
&gt;not having storytelling at all like in vanilla and TBC
---
What a moronic statement to make.
---
Oh wow that's surprising. Guess I should have checked
---
I won’t even try Modern WoW. I know I won’t like it. Even though WoW is technically my favorite game ever. It will just make me depressed 😔
---
Why not both? 
---
https://www.steadyhealth.com/medical-answers/causes-of-testicular-asymmetry
---
Give paladins a taunt so the Alliance have an extra tank class would be acceptable if you give shamans a baseline melee ability aside storm strike so they can be a sustainable dps class.
---
And there you have balance.
---
I found another addicting MMO which has helped me "forget about classic". I only check for updates a couple times a day now lol
---
Literally made a guide on this exact topic months ago lol. Was so frustrated seeing it in EVERY big youtubers guides
---
https://youtu.be/3tI-OtcaiXw
---
So what you're saying is you have no source you're just making wild guesses, because it has never once been officially communicated (which is all that matters).
---
Honestly I'm still wondering why they're not pulling back on it. It's killing so many aspects of the game.
---
I remember booping your  Black Desert videos.
---
Can't wait for the Classic content.
---
1-20 can take up to 24 hours played for new players. 
---
On a fresh realm, certain players see it as crucial to push through those first 20 levels immediately to get past the pack and be able to get tags.
---
For a lot of classes, it’s when you feel the weakest. Mobs get harder, your still in white items and your skills aren’t all there yet.
---
Alliance also have Stromgarde Keep in Arathi Highland
---
Gosh you just awakened my Trauma from back then when a certain pserver started and theres was thousands of People in every starter Zone ...
---
I started as human then and holy shit .... EVERY FUCKING MOB in the starting Zone was camped by at least 3 People. They had dynamic spawns active, cause all Mobs to despawn after like 2 sec, not really giving you enough time to loot because of the lag and then the mob respawning again after 2 secs so that all the People on EACH mob spawn could try to tag it.
---
Yeah it will only work for the first player. You can still grab the FP's though.
---
I'd go for the long run if that means that I can play the class/spec I enjoy playing.
---
Holy fuck lmfao thats insane
---
The problem is where do you draw the line? Vanilla has insane buffs and consumables. Why not flask up, use every possible potion, get friends to buff you, get full world buffs, rare 1-use world drops, spend 6 hours and 300g? 
---
It's much easier just to set a ground rule of "no consumables" or "only grenades" to make for fair dueling.
---
No worries, it’s good advice. :)
---
I know how this all works, more just curious for end game.
---
Would it really be WoW if shamans wern't getting slapped by the nerf bat?
---
Pirate scum or they watched one of the thousands of videos that recommend it.
---
I heard there was a beta coming in a few months?
---
Honestly I'd go Arms even on a PvE just because the talents are pretty useful for tanking, even moreso than protection ones for quite some time.
---
Warriors are the strongest vanilla pvpers in the game.
---
Enhance shaman dreams died in 2005.  The only real option is elemental or resto.  And I ain't so interested in PvE so Elemental it is.
---
WF totem, Purge, Chain heal.
---
One more job than paladins!
---
I haven't assumed anything, except that the /played for a character will be substantially more than 1-2 days, which is how much time it takes to get to 20 casually.
---
did you just have a stroke?
---
Not necessarily, the marketing budget behind both games (classic=nihil?) can influence it a lot.
---
Or literally any of the other longer quest lines with good stories like duskwood quests. I don't know what this guys talking about with vanilla having no stories.   
---
Spoonfed stories with streamlined quest routes are boring as fuck. I need to be exploring.
---
I imagine most guild raids will still use master loot. If I give out an item to one person and they sell it to another person, circumventing my loot system, both of those players will get the boot from my guild. 
---
Maybe in pugs, but I don't think you'll see alot of loot selling between guildies.
---
I have to disagree. I've played all the WoW expansions and BfA is currently my least favorite. I looked past the "de-leveling" experience and just enjoyed the zones, and was having a blast up and through mythic release, but then they just absolutely shit the bed and ruined the experience so I unsubbed.
---
I remember going "what can they fuck up next?" only to realize they hot patched my weapon into a cosmetic item. Fucking lol.
---
&gt; **they've** always eaten up every bit of convenience they can get without being able to see how it affects the bigger picture, and it's ultimately what's led us to where we are now.
---
What's even worse is realizing that in many cases, it's a "we" and not a "they" that caused this.  I remember when Flying came out... I thought it was cool as hell!  When dual-spec dropped, I was crazy happy to finally have both a PvP and PvE spec I could swap between, it was super convenient!  The portals from Shattrath were nice, too, super convenient.  But then by the time Cata rolled around, it became apparent that these were all truly "death by a hundred cuts" kind of devolution of the game.
---
It was a hard lesson to learn, but it's one that will always stick with me.
---
 **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.  
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.   
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message.   
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other. 
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

The amount of carebear in this thread is astounding. If you're not on a pvp server you're missing out on a giant section of the game, its overall theme and the designers original intent.
---
Sorry man, Paladins are PvE gods. I'll take a salv and kings over anything a shaman is offering.
---
And you're assuming there aren't a significant number of mages and warlocks who are like that?
---
Don't you also love the whole time-gating the story to the point where you can only do 20 minutes of the quest chain a week for 2 months?  So much fun.
---
Do you guys have a guild in retail? I'm interested
---
not yet ;)
---
Uh, Vanilla frost mages???
---
It's okay if it's only in the starting zones for a limited amount of time tbh.
---
"it's not bad, you just don't like it"
---
Potato, potato.
---
Just as much as I loved waiting a whole extra month to do warfronts (Horde) just to realize you can never lose them, and they're a pile of garbage!
---
Some people lost their warfronts at first!  Mainly cause 18 people AFKed and only 2 people were actually playing and couldn't keep up with the waves but still... ah how great BFA was.
---
Nothing. Blizzard will keep developing content for retail. 
---
Classic is classic. 
---
What may happen is if classic is a massive long term smash hit—it will influence development decisions on live.
---
I bet the expansion after bfa is too far into development to make MASSIVE changes, but if classic is a hit, we could see a trend towards classic design philosophies in the expansion after the expansion after bfa. 
---
Activision wants subscriptions. They don’t care whether those people are playing classic or retail. Messing with classic too soon, will lead more people to leave than it will bring in.
---
Relatively speaking, very few people are saying, “hmm 2019, let’s see what game should I play? You know I’ve been hearing about wow for 15 years—never Have played it, suppose i will try it”. That is hardly happening.
---
The much more typical case is a former wow player deciding to return to the game. Blizzard should be targeting classic and retail at the pool of 100million + people who have played wow, not the 6.9 billion who after 15 years still haven’t installed it once.
---
I do, thanks!
---
Level 80... meaning you left in Wotlk... that has been a long time ago and that has been a completely different game that you've been playing. 
---
I personally managed to play for a little bit longer back then all the way till the early MoP as it was at that point after finishing the first tier of raids that I realized, that this game is just not for me any-more. Many elements came for that, for me the final blow was probably LFR. Before LFR I still enjoyed raiding but after that, raiding became only difficulty challenge to overcome with guildies but nothing more than that. And so after two main raids of LFR, I knew that I can no longer continue and promised myself to never go back as long as LFR is there. 
---
I still kept up with the news though, as I always wanted to go back but yea, with each expansion it became worse and worse. Right now the game isn't even like it was with MoP, much less Wotlk, or Classic.
---
I have sets for: pure heal set, pure decurse set (mp5-spirit), fire resist set (for ragna or some bwl fights), tanking set, and pvp-farming set (you will be ganked when you farm).
---
Ret paladin pvp, though.
---
Yes, you made a statement that is an assumption it applies to everyone.  It doesn't.
---
Lol and the misinformed keep spreading misinformation
---
Downvoted.
---
you are actually completely wrong and there are a ton of advantage, and reasons for that:
---
1. The starting levels are the most important, and crucial and you need the most polish of it. and thats also something that you can easily practice, as you start at level 1. cos unless you setup your own private server, you can't like start from level 40 and practice 40-50 leveling runs. 
---
2. ppl that get to 60 fast, actually got a lot of advantages, as they run the economy and can get their hands on many things available in the world and still not touched. And will be first to get many things, recipes/patterns and so on. from black lotus, devilsaur, to tidal charm and other things.
---
3. you get involved with top end players of the server get all the connections with ppl that gonna be top dogs on the server, get yourself known and in general build a social network. and join the guild with the best players. if you level like a potato most the spots in best guild will be taken. and in general it will be harder to join. the best players also level fast.
---
4. gearing takes awhile so the most raid cds you can squize the better for you. ppl that miss one or two cds at the start, it will take like a  month (if not more) to catch up and feel that they on the same level to the rest of the server. realitically more, you will always feel behind in gear. its not fun to feel gimped.
---
5. also its just fun. people like to excel at things. Especially since it gives all the advantages i described above. if you ask like that, you can ask why do anything just lie and look at your ceiling. its gaming ppl are having fun the way they want.
---
p.s. also you seem to have some miscoseption about consumables. most consumables = gold. you buy them not farm, and what you actually farm is gold, not concumables (escept few cases). And getting to server in the upper echelone actually very profitable as you are top dog in the economy, get your hand on rare recipes, boe gear and pattern, flask recipes, ubrs keys and so on. So its not about just playtime, its about gold making, that sets you up for aq and naxx. and leveling fast sets you up for that. (aswell as getting a spot in the good guild (which more likely gets to naxx and aq)).
---
Hunter is probably the most intensive class from the mechanics perspective. They were the last class to be added into the game just before launch.
---
Level. Faster.
---
Back in classic there were spreadsheets with formulas to calculate upgrades. Doing it the old way in the spirit of classic. #nochanges 😆
---
I levelled a warrior and a spriest from 58 till ding 60 there.
---
It was very quiet, but you'd still see a few people.
---
Then the Chinese farmers discovered the place ...
---
LFR as a concept isn't that bad, especially as the game story is primarily through raids. 
---
I think the deeper issues are that it drops purple gear (putting it in endgame gear progression), it rewards bad behavior and anonymity (group finder problems but at the largest size), and most importantly it misunderstands casual player priorities. At the risk of overgeneralization, no one enjoys doing LFR but they do it because the gear is there and the game is about gear. 
---
TBC had a variety of content types - 25 man raids, 10 man raids, and 5 man dungeons. That may not have been a sustainable development strategy, but you could play and progress in your own lane. Essentially Blizzard's data said raids weren't popular enough, and the solution was to make more people raid instead of focusing on other content.
---
I swear I thought reckoning was out pre patch LK. I don’t know why, maybe I didn’t touch the prot tree much 10 years ago. I don’t understand why people think something like that or /sit would make it to classic. Of course blizz is going to finely tune the game to avoid stuff like this
---
You’re probably right, but I don’t think a majority of people would be happy about“new” features or updates to Classic unless they could pick and choose which features were added to it. Eventually they will have to do something to it maybe a year or two down the line. The question was what will they or should they do and there is no easy answer. Say the just run through the expansions again. That might work but eventually they will hit an expansion players don’t want, or they will try to do something different with it and take it down a different path than retail. They could always just add the stuff in Vanilla then just leave it alone forever, but how long would the game last once the majority of players who raid are done with the final raid or the pvp players reach max? 
---
There really isn’t a perfect solution. They can’t change to much but they also have to try and keep players engaged and coming back so they will eventually have to either add new content that wasn’t around the first time, or just re run through all of the expansions most players have already played.
---
Yes, you basically need to have a reason for others to carry you.
---
You'll never convince these casual neck beards that pvp is the right thing to do.
---
So basically, Druids can just farm tons of sets for any occasion. I love this class.
---
Like wasting time on that stupid in-game discord group clone that nobody asked for and later said was the reason the servers went to shit on release lol.
---
I hope this is a joke?
---
No. gets away.
---
I currently play the game and somewhat enjoy it, but it still leaves a void that only Classic will fill. Contrary to popular belief, I don’t think LFD is what ruined WoW community - when Wrath came out there was LFD, but people still talked when they queued for dungeons, now no one talks because the classes are so homogenized and regular dungeons so easy that you could do them without having a healer because every class is self-sufficient. It’s just a race to get to the bosses, get the loot and get out, with no mechanics whatsoever. I once saw our healer accidentally pull a group of mobs and went to help out - the tank and other 2 dps didn’t care and kept going, then they pulled the boss and downed him as if they still had 5 people, it made no difference that they had no healer and were short 1 dps.
---
I think what killed the community is phasing and sharding. IMO this is the biggest reason it feels like Destiny or ESO - people pop in and out of your world and go about their day like they are NPCs - there’s no interaction between players because chances our in 10 minutes they’ll shard out and you will never see them again or see them only once or twice.
---
The reason I’m still playing is because I still think despite its flaws it’s still the best MMORPG in the market now, and because it still gives me goals to strive for - I work on achievements to unlock flying in the new zones and work on achievements to unlock allied races (who I think are super cool, especially the Kul Tirans - pun intended), and I feel like all the new changes are probably a plus for the RP community because things like transmog allow you to dress your character the way you intend to RP them without sacrificing stats, so I’m working on unlocking all the allied races, then I’m gonna try an RP server as a Kul Tiran.
---
So in short, the game still gives me things to do that I enjoy (though would have been more awesome if it were more social), but it’s still no Classic WoW. When Classic comes out, I’ll be playing MOSTLY Classic, but I will still play BFA on the side too.
---
This is one of the reasons why I feel like BfA is actually not very casual friendly - because much of the content casuals want to do it too easily completed and outgeared. They funnel everybody very quickly into the hardest endgame content that your average casual doesn't want to do, or once they get there, they don't have the skill level to do because they've been able to outgear or entirely skip the previous content, so they never learned.
---
Blizz's attempt to make top tier endgame content casual friendly has ruined the gameplay that casuals typically enjoy, and which typically teaches the average player how to play. So people get bored and don't know what else to do.
---
Looking forward to a slower pace in Classic where more content is actually worth doing. I want to have fun actually playing, not opening a loot pinata and then being done.
---
If you win time in 1-20 you will get ahead of the curve. As a mage ( me ) you will be able to aoe farm uncontested and unganked.
---
I just want to get to 60 fast for my own reasons.
---
I see your point but is the point of a guild NOT primarily to secure most of a raid team? And a good point on having to do another raid for tf. You really just need to gather mats for hammer.
---
Why does it matter if it takes a few hours more?   
---
Say you work on salary at your company. Your normal hours are 9-5 and you need to get a project done TODAY. While trying to get that project done you keep getting pulled into meetings or co-workers keep asking for help on trivial tasks, or billy from IT screwed up your account so he spends hours troubleshooting. 
---
Well everything is finally working at 3PM and you're able to start working on your project. 5PM rolls round and you're still working. You start wraping things up around 9PM and you finally get out the door at 10PM. You're on salary so you don't get paid OT, but now you just worked for 5 hours for FREE. 
---
Your work day turned into 13 hours day instead of 8 just because other people were causing you to work less efficently. 
---
THAT is why it matters. When I do things, I want to work as efficently as possible. When I know I can do something in 2 hours but it takes me 5 hours it actually pisses me off lol. "An MMO isn't for you then boosh", you're wrong... An MMO is for me. Like you said, 1-20 is 5%, actually probably less than that of my characters life span. I dont give a shit about those levels or how I did them. I just want it done. I'd actually be willing to say leveling up my characters from 1-60 is probably 10% of my characters /played time in the end, if even that. The level process should be enjoyed sure, but I enjoy being level 60 a lot more than level 1-59, so getting to the point where I can enjoy my class as efficently and effectively as possible is my goal.
---
Best chance to make it a reality is to 
---
A) pay someone who could develop it, because a lot of addon developers wouldn’t do it for free. 
---
B) figure out how to code it yourself therefore it can be as close to how you envision it as possible
---
C) pitch the idea really well to addon developers that entices them to create it, if the idea is good enough they may go for it.

Dammit, Al Gore.
---
Boooooooo..
---
Low quallity.
---
Of course lfr is easier, again I'm not arguing which game is more casual / easy (and that example is bad because 20 people could probably go afk in molten core with no problems).
---
M+ was a smart idea, but it's entirely tied up with the incremental item level improvements and generic loot that the most recent expansions have brought in. 
---
Sort of beside the point, but my personal gripe with M+ is the tanking meta is gamey and imo bad. It rewards you for not tanking, which isn't the reason I rolled a tank. In a lot of ways it's a product and a contributor to the overly optimized contemporary game.
---
I never said carrying wasn't possible and neither did I say that every game is a coinflip. I stated that the team you get or face is a coinflip, which is a different thing.
---
I also said that the 8/1 game in particular made something click, which in itself does not mean it's the first and only game I lost in those circumstances.
---
It's a game. That content you want to gate is already gated by difficulty. The raids are also a main part of the story which is one of the main points of fucking WoW lol. It's clear you just wanna feel special and act as a gate keeper to content you feel entitled to.
---
1. Combat daggers were actually the build to go in late Vanilla, outdpsing swords combat on bosses. Can't remember correctly but i think it was buffed in a rogue revamp, which happened in 1.12.
---
2. Combat swords/fists/mace did not suck in pvp. Yeah, you're slower but riposte, imp kick (silence) and AR + BF totally make up for it. I don't wanna argue if it's better than hemo/21-8-22 or seal fate builds, but it surely doesn't suck.

Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST.

ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.  
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Or just play with those who don't obsess with the things you describe. ;)
---
I love the way male orcs look in gear but find them a bit odd on the warlock mounts.
---
When it comes to undead racials vs orc (for warlock) I’m always back and forth. I know that stun resist helps us against many classes, and our worst matchups, but I love the undead racials too.
---
WotF is good, and cannibalize is also good. I always got jealous seeing undead warlocks chomping away on corpses and having that free trinket slot due to having WotF. I also think how alchemy could help me break out of stuns, but I really don’t like the thought of burning free/living action pots just because I decided to roll undead.
---
It’s gonna be a hard choice for me in the end...
---
And that's totally fine, but some people prefer to clear raids as fast as possible, that's why optimal specs still matter.
---
While I agree there are still big unknowns and I would love a nice juicy blue post, I think it's just going to be some minor garbage. Par for the course you know.
---
😂😂😂 well played.
---
Bashing retail and its players is free karma around here. Just look at this post.
---
I dont leave the house
---
After 5000 hours logged, I will be leaving Path of Exile for WoW Classic. I played WoW pretty much religiously from early vanilla to mid WoD. I am so ready to no-life the crap out of classic.
---
Do you know what an rpg even is?
---
I had a dream once with me being a mage and trying to run away from Horde. The place looked a bit like Nagrand from WoD. Now weirdly enough I play horde but I was a human in my dream
---
You haven't really gave me any arguments. Yes, getting to 60 fast is important. But even if you speedlevel 1-20 won't be a big slice out of that to warrant such theorycrafting. 40-60 takes way more time, thus it would be logical to optimize that more.
---
And yes, consumables can be both sold and bought with money. Thing is, usually it is better to get the mats and craft those consums yourself (or with the help of a guildie) Not the mention that gold has inflation on top of certain items prize skyrocket when they become useful (like nature resist gear near AQ release)
---
So yeah, you farm gold to buy consumables. Or you farm mats for consumables. Either way, you are doing something repeatable to get consumables. So you farm consumables.
---
Darude Sandstorm
---
A realization I came to in Cataclysm is that more complex mechanics don't always translate to a more complex fight.
---
I think the name was Alysrazor, the bird boss in Firelands.  That thing had like 15 different abilities in its dungeon journal entry.  And as a healer, I only really cared about 2 or 3 of them.  Everything else was either:
---
* Don't stand in glowy stuff on the ground
---
* Heal the damage done by the abilities
---
* Some gimmick that a DPS would deal with
---
There were only a few abilities I'd really pay attention to, but the majority of the fight boiled down to healing basics.  Part of this might be the nature of healing, and how very few fights changed up what a healer has to do, but another part is that if the mechanics don't break the mold, it's just extra noise.
---
ofc, you can do whatever you want, its not like there is one way to have fun. i just explained to the guy why ppl do it, and whats benefits of it. there are a ton of benefits to leveling fast, its not just for the sake of it.
---
lol ok
---
Cool story
---
I couldn't agree more with this. There are aspects of retail that I enjoyed for a bit. The cutscenes, the story aspect, and some of the class changes (more in legion) were interesting. I could not care less about Azerite or the amulet, or running dungeons for generic loot that isn't interesting and all fits into one of 3 sets. 
---
They just killed the spirit of the game and I cannot wait for classic!
---
Ok so everyone here is speculating on what they think vanilla will be like. I provided currently working models of video game companies and you act like I'm the devil or some heretic. Go fuck yourself and learn how businesses work and how they attract or keep people around.
---
It's cool but there already is one - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc
---
Part of the ilvl issue is how it has exploded across tiers. Minor fluctuations in ilvl leave more room for picking stats, but raw stats just overpower almost everything else. 
---
The difference between normal Uldir and normal Dazar'alor was 30 (!) points, the same as a blue geared 60 and a Naxx raider.
---
You are either stupid or a troll. I’m going with the first just so I can say the following:
---
Classic community is all about no changes. While there are some people taking this to the extreme your suggestion is extreme to the other end.
---
Everyone agrees that if it comes down to it we’d rather be extreme no changes just to protect the project.
---
Your ideas are not welcome. I am so sorry. But feel free to express your opinions, beware of downvotes.
---
100% correct.
---
A lot of that is from pre patch 1.8, when the damage calculation "double-dipped" on both damage range and weapon speed.  After that, all daggers are treated as 1.7 speed, and other 1-handers as 2.4 speed for the calculation, so only damge range matters.
---
I came here to say:  worried?  I'm counting on it!
---
I’m so worried that this whole approach Blizzard seems to be taking to reconstructing this game will be a huge disaster. I don’t think it will be but man the fear keeps me up at night (especially since still no release date).
---
On repeat for 5 hours straight while wiping on onyxia?
---
Retail may be the epitome of “theme park”, but for its time classic was a theme park too.
---
SWG was very much a sandbox. I’m not sure player made cities would work in wow—where is the space?
---
Optimizing takes effort. I feel like this sub is optimizing a miniscule detail while the rest of the stuff does not really get much attention. 
---
A min/maxer's  PVE char life will consist of:
---
1. Getting to 60
---
2. Getting pre-raid gear from 5-mans
---
3. Farming gold and mats consumables
---
4. Getting wbuffs for raids
---
5. Raiding.
---
6. Ranking (optional)
---
Which one of these will take the most time? That is the one you want to optimize the most so 10% more efficient can translate to hours or days saved. You don't want to optimize the part which takes 1% of your time if the others are neglected.
---
Not for 5s and pvp lol
---
Dang it, sorry
---
Alliance will have more hunters because they have elves. 
---
Horde will have more pvp try hards with engineering.
---
these are actually fantastic, nice composition and shapes op.
---
Someone told us it so it’s 100% guaranteed to be the case!
---
I agree with most, but at point 4 there is another side to it.    If you are a latecomer to raiding it's often super easy to catch up, because you get stuff the front runners in the guild already have.  Obviously you won't get the current BiS top item over a veteran, but you can catch up 80% of the gear from  6 months of raiding in  a few weeks, by getting all the 'regular drops' the others in your class already own.   
---
apart from this, you speak like a (semi)hardcore raider. You are right from that point of view, but don't forget most of the player base will be way more casual, they won't bother with planning ahead for AQ40 consumables , they will be content if they can slowly work to their mount or whatever goal they set for themselves.
---
 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Of my guild of 50+ people, less than 5 have any interest in classic. Maybe more will have a screw around alt on classic, but they actually like retail. I'm the only person in my guild who has explicitly stated I'm full swapping to classic.
---
Classic surely has a chance to compile it's own population with a million+ users, but retail is so different that one really won't impact the other much. And either was Actiblizz doesn't care, they get the sub either way.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury: Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
&gt;Horde will have more pvp try hards with engineering.
---
Alliance will have gnome frost mages with engineering though.
---
A friend of mine picked up WoW as her first PC game ever.  In a couple months she went from 0-120 and ilvl 398.
---
My best character is 404 (I don't raid) but tank mythics 10+.  That is the reality of WoW.  It's participation.
---
So basically, you gave into Blizzard again, even though you knew the game is trash. Funny how people like you work, you are the type of people that complain but yet keep giving them money. The whole "vote with your wallet" thing is spot on, give them money when they deserve it (hopefully like Classic). But yet people still complain and keep subbing to retail. It's sad, I think.
---
Garrisons were such a great feature. 
---
I’ve got a house rl, and my sister owns the sims—why would I want to spend my dragon slaying time decorating?
---
I honestly don’t see you playing portable much with a child. What I do see you doing is playing later at night. Working together with your GF to take care of your child, a nice plan could be for her to sleep later in the night and you stay up to take care of the baby when they wake up. While you wait for those times, you’ll have a good amount of downtime to play. 
---
That is if you’re willing to not sleep much.
---
Thank goodness
---
This is my #1 concern. Asmongold recently did a video where he raided Orgrimmar with maybe about 40 players and it was completely unplayable. Modern WoW architecture doesn't seem to be able to handle any sort of large-scale open world PvP.
---
The gameplay feels good.  It feels more like an action game.  But the rewards and content are lacking.
---
P.Server trends point to the top 0.1% players generally stacking on alliance, both for PvE(human sword racial) and PvP(Paladins). Competitive-but-sane players will tend horde, and Battlegrounds will reflect this dichotomy. Pug BGs tend to favor horde, but alliance premades stomp everything in their path. 
---
However I suspect that Classic will draw in a much larger crowd of casual players who won't roll based on whats optimal; my (optimistic) point of view is that this will delude the spread of class/race combos to being much more even than on traditional private servers where human fury warriors and ud mage/rogues are everywhere.
---
This is vanilla. There is no 5's and in open world pvp you'll get shit stomped by people who get into raids for the high tier loot (these classes wont).
---
oh it's going to be glorious, seeing how bagspace will be very very limited for everyone starting out.  No more high drop rates on the bags, no more freebies made for the new guy....  such rich rewards when you finally get that first traveller's backpack in Stratholme.
---
Shadow priest getting shit stomped - ok
---
It's been a while now since this changed, but I assume in Classic we'll revert to the old scheme where Hunters (and Shamans?) wore leather up to a certain level, and then mail after that point. And I think Warriors and Pallys also wore mail to start and then moved on to plate later. So if you want to make use of crafting while leveling, would you want to pick the profession that follows the same armor weight progression as your character?
---
I agree the 1-20% is a small portion of your leveling, but it weighs highly on the rest of your leveling as well. If you get ahead of everyone and stay ahead of people going from 1-20 you'll have a much easier time not competing for mobs later on. 
---
Most people will probably play I'd say 1-8 hours on the same character the first day of launch. Maybe a little bit longer and the try hards will play probably for 24. If you come out in the first 24 hours and are level 25ish, you'll be so far ahead the pack that you really wont have to deal with anyone as long as you keep a semi decent leveling pace up. Those lower level zones will probably remain packed for the first few weeks causing everyone within those zones to level much slower.
---
I hopped on a private server just to see what it was like and to make a final decision on class and spec. 
---
I have nearly 10 days played already in the last week's. The game is like crack. I don't know whats so special about it but it just triggers everything.
---
It will be really hard to find a healthy balance of gaming working girlfriend and university.
---
What makes the game so good for me and is often overlooked is that everything is so chill. Sure. It can get tense in PvP and raiding but unlike leave or counterstrike or whatever you can hop on the game listen to the soundtrack and just farm something or explore. It's just a so immersive world where you are not forced to do anything in particular.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

Well if you're aoe farming he isn't really wrong.. But yeah it's probably a joke xD
---
People will tell you not to go destro in PvP, as it’s not the “best” spec, buts it’s definitely viable. It’s the player after all, if you can excel at that spec. By all means do it. 
---
I had a friend who HATED affliction (and loved destro). So he stuck with it. And he was damn good at it and did just fine.
---
Classic feels more like D&amp;D, retail feels more like a action adventure video game.
---
I guess it differs depending on where you live. But here in Sweden all you need is a few days of training a drug test plus health check and an approval from SÄPO(like secret service/police) that you're not a terrorist.
---
Haven’t seen it mentioned here, make it a priority to get an autoshot timer. More than any other class it makes a huge difference gameplay wise.
---
Not only to avoid clipping with aimed shot and multi shot, but it allows you to kite indefinitely without missing hardly any white hits.
---
Most game can be played casually or hardcore.
---
Farming hours of mats everyday to gets some world firsts. That's not casual. Farming some mats to sell it on the AH then doing dungeons. Thats bit more causal. Same game different play-styles.
---
good post dude
---
I'm not saying that it's difficult, I'm saying it's easier to lie about it on reddit to try and sound like a badass.
---
Jokes on y'all, I never stopped being addicted!
---
...wait shoot
---
SM / Ruin spec as a warlock sounds right for you, just google it and you'll find a lot of guides :-) It's decent in PvE and PvP
---
Disc:  Haste &gt; Mastery = Crit = Vers lol

Mature response.
---
Weapons are rare, and every one wants them.
---
Is deathbringer + Crul’Shoruk better? Certainly. 
---
Will every warrior have those? Fuck no.

You take what’s available. Some rogues will be daggers, rest will be maxes/fists/swords. Some warriors will be 2h fury, rest will be dwing swords, maces, fists, axes. 
---
Certainly viable, but I wouldn’t look to exclusively wield fist weps. You’ll need to be as equal opportunity as possible with the weapons you get access to/have a shot at.
---
You...you didn't play vanilla, did you?
---
I've had the opposite problem.  I keep joining guilds with the intention of playing with them, and then I never do.  It's easier to ignore relationship-building and just PUG everything.  All you need is an IO score.
---
Fist weapons spec only gives crit, and sword spec gives and entire hit. It's not that big a loss, but sword spec definitely scales better.
---
I've been playing private servers for BC and WotLK. Made the wait much easier.
---
Tl;dr No
---
Can you elaborate on what was wrong/broken? Did it lag or something?
---
"quest log? pfah back in my day we didn't finish a single quest in 50 years of play"
---
"no experience loss on death? carebear trash"
---
"no pvp in raids? wtf is this shit?"
---
Dude you made a thread about theory crafting non healing shaman in classic and then judged my comment about speculating the ongoing future of classic. Gtfo
---
 It's not 25% total. They covered this in one of the classic podcasts. Its added on top of the base. So it comes out somewhere around 18-19%.. which h is still really good.
---
Sorry to say in Patch 1.12 swords are superior in raid DPS. Aside from very specific boss fights such as Vaelastrasz or decked out in AQ40 gear with a Seal/Fate built before NAX arrives daggers will under perform in comparison to swords.  
---
The very reason why you think Combat can perform well in PvP, by blowing 5min CD AR, is exactly the reason why it sucks. They must blow their cooldowns to rush an opponent down and use Sprint/Vanish as gap closers. Combat has only a single vanish on 5 min CD or Sprint on 3.5 and that's all she wrote. Mobility is a key factor in PvP and the problem isn't the 15 seconds when you're using them, it's those 5 minutes where you can't.  
---
You can't afford to take either improved kick or Riposte either if you want a good PvE build. You also want Imp Sprint and Endurance, at some point it would mean skipping out on mandatory damage talents such as Precision or Duel Wield Specialization. Why go combat if you decide to take all the PvP talents? Just pick a PvP spec then and actually perform to the best of your ability.
---
No because I'm happy to have given my retail guild multiple warning about leaving. Also start of financial year we get all our PTO. So by knowing, I can conserve PTO usage over the summer until it drops.

I did - you...you aren’t paying attention are you? There’s these things called “phases” - have you read about them? Yeah...where 5 man gear will be important and shadow priests can 1v1 almost anyone, then when rank gear comes out with other raids in phase 3...so are you going to move the goalposts now and say “oh yeah shadow priest will get shit stomped by Naxx and AQ gear” oh ok...nice talking to you
---
Solution: Big Dick furyProt DW Tank. Take all the gear as main spec.  
---
Unless your offspec is bear tank or (less so) warr/pala tank, it'll be a long time before you get to a raid-level offset besides a few MC pieces.

---
You think you want to play troll hunter but trust me you dont.
---
Just roll dwarf bro !
---
Yeah, but how many people will just stop playing or switch alts before getting Naxx on farm? And how many guilds will survive long enough to really farm it? I'm pretty sure a lot of Naxx stuff will still be pretty rare.
---
True of course. However even then no-one could remember every item, but when there were set goal items you had real reason to remember.
---
I would feel like somebody who wants do die.
---
&gt; On private servers ive played horde has usually been more active in bgs and thus shorter join times for bgs for alliance. 
---
This is incorrect. Because your side is less active it means you get more matches. If your side was more active you will have more people fighting for those spots to fight against the smaller pool of the other side resulting in longer queues. If horde side has 30 people doing WSG and the allies have 20 people. The first 2 matches will queue and play while the horde side's last 10 players will have to wait for another 10 of the ally side to queue. After 1 match of WSG ends and those players re-queue those 10 allies will instantly pop because the horde have 10 players waiting for a match while the horde will once again have 10 people in the queue after the start of that last match.
---
With a good route you should hit level 5 in like 20-25 minutes, and you'll have enough silver for your skills and maybe a weapon from a quest, depending on your class and route. While the exploration guy won't be able to buy his level 4 skills (the videos linked in this thread has the guy running around with 0c with level 4).
---
A good route takes overpopulation into consideration, and since we most likely will have sharding in the starting zones, it won't be as bad as some private server launches.
---
Well yea, where is the math? The only math we have is from some post on elitist jerks which is obviously faulty because it was based on people doing trash DPS.
---
I will have to agree with others when they say it depends on the meaning of casual vs hardcore. Some people relate these terms to the amount of time you can play the game, others relate it to the amount of effort and/or skill people play. People can play for a small amount of time but put in maximum effort or skill into the game, so the definitions surely are fuzzy. For me, the idea of a hardcore game vs a casual game is the amount of time it takes in one sitting to accomplish anything.
---
 A lot of what made Everquest so difficult was the time aspect. Not that you couldn't take your time to experience anything, but you honestly needed to dedicate 3-6 hours AT A TIME to do anything at all. Between finding a group, finding a place to grind, recovering from dying, etc - you could not accomplish anything at all meaningful, in any point of the game, without playing for a large chunk of time at once. 
---
The only aspect where that was true in vanilla was raiding. To have any meaningful progress for a raid you needed to sit at your PC for 3-4 hours at one time. Other than that, you could log in for 20 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours or 6 hours and find something to do that felt productive and meaningful in your characters progress. If you wanted to be a raider, you needed to have a certain level of availability in the game. But the fact that raiding was the only real aspect that made the game a lot more accessible to play, hence making it more "casual"
---
I've not personally played BFA because I feel like it is too casual in that sense. If you can log in for 20 minutes and accomplish the same tasks it might take 3 hours to do in a different "mode" then neither mode seems that exciting. Why spend 3 hours raiding when I can spend 30 minutes, barely need to pay attention, and get gear that is only \*Slightly\* worse then gear you get after a 3 hour long raid?  How is that experience of /facerolling for free epics rewarding in any way? 
---
So I do buy into the idea that being able to make meaningful progress in the game without investing large chunks of time at once makes it more casual, and I think Vanilla did that well for leveling and crafting and PvP for players more focused on PvE. But for the raid scene you needed to be able to log in for at least 3 4 hour sessions a week or you didn't make any meaningful raid progression.
---
Except to everyone who knows how to kite
---
def need more than 2 sets as a druid.
---
If you can't see the impact that 1 to 20 has on 21 to 60 then you're missing the point big time.
---
Someone here is shadow banned, I think.
---
There's no way you played at launch and think these things about shadow priests, I'm sorry. Have a good day.
---
You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.
---
Well it's definitely gotten worse for every season since s4, but it's still one of the few good airing tv-series right now. 
---
So much dogshit on Netflix and everywhere else at this point so I'll take what I can get
---
The problem with questions like this is that everyone has a different definition of the word "viable." Can you do it? Yes. Will you carry your fair share of the weight in a 40man raid? No. Is it worth it? No one can answer that except for you. 
---
Ret Pally struggles with inconsistent and subpar damage, and while it can be fully decked out in big gear to be kinda-competitive, the low-drop environment of vanilla raiding means that every item that goes to you, doesn't go to a fury warrior who could be putting it to better use. And there are a lot of fury warriors in a 40man raid.
---
In PvP I've seen it used with some success, but again that is at very high end with lots of gear, and even then it is extremely vulnerable to being kited out. It ain't easy, it ain't particularly good, but if you love the spec, you can technically run it and eventually have some success with it.
---
&gt; Pservers that make it to naxx die because there is always a fresh server on the horizon that kills guilds. 
---
Is it really the fresh server that's the cause there? Or is it that people move to fresh servers (and demand them) because they have reached "the end" of the game? What's the point in farming Naxx when there's nothing more to kill?
---
Enhance has so much more mobility and snares and similarly unpredictable burst. 
---
I’ll give you balance tho.
---
sadly, from my remembrance ilvl was born in vanilla WoW (though it may have been adopted from another game i'm not sure).  it was common to use mods that showed ilvls because gear was all over the place.  It was just to show the items stat budget cause by the end some blue from ZG or AQ20 would be better than the MC purples.
---
I agree though it has gotten out of hand.  It takes the thinking out of gear progression.
---
May i ask how you generated the talent JSON data?  I was looking at using the data for a similar project and was having a hard time trying to figure out how to generate the data vs manually constructing it with the end being something similar to what you have.  Latter isn't hard to figure out how to do, just a lot of monotonous work and hard coding =/
---
I can tell you aren't university educated.
---
Lightning's blade NA   and Ontario 613 area code.
---
We have over 30 members of original lightnings blade players and about 50% of our group is from the Ottawa area.    
---
If your from the Ottawa area or played on lightnings blade NA and would like to join  us.
---
Simply choose lightnings blade as your server.  
---
Should lightnings blade not be a server option choose the first pvp server alphabetically starting with the letter L
---
You begin to understand when you get more than 30-40 people in pvp combat together in the open world. The servers just break. Whatever they're doing isn't working without sharding, they've seemingly built the whole server infrastructure around not having people together.
---
Nearly all of the heavy hitters for classic will be streaming for a bajillion hours straight after launch, just go to twitch, warcraft classic tab(if it has its own), then take a few minutes to pop in each one and see where they are playing.  Another way would be to just to pop in and see what their character names are real fast, then do a /who "name" and if nothing shows up they aren't on your server.
---
this shit is hilarious u just need to clean it up a bit.

A+ for futurama

In retail vanilla I never listened to external music when I played wow, only the in game music
---
I have somewhere around 500 days on retail on my main. I played daily from Nov 04 until 3 weeks into wod.
---
Nothing wrong with what you describe, if you enjoy it. It just comes off as something you *must* do do enjoy the game.
---
And for the crowds, I'll let them go ahead. I've created a guild for people who don't like to rush. We won't even start raiding before at least half a year has passed since release. :)
---
This, tbh.
---
I'm as excited about classic as the next guy, but holy shit, the desperation is unreal. Go play older games or go outside or something, y'all. Holy shit.

# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
While we have the “basic stepstones” covered (such as a MT and a minimum amount of healers/dpsers), we still have plenty of room for additional people.
---
What we’re looking for are mainly dedicated players. Which means, if you have the passion to keep on playing, and the willingness to show it in your commitment (i.e. show up for raids and group content, bring consumables, improve your game and so on), then you’re the kind of person we want to invite in our guild.
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
· A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
· Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
· English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we’re planning to begin our raids at 8-9 PM server time (depending on players’ availability). Exact days/hours will be set in stone once we get closer to Classic WoW’s release date and our ranks are properly filled.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you’ll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.
---

The problem with blizzard today is that for some reason unknown to human nature and instinct that turned us from spineless lifeforms, to species that landed on the moon, is that they tried to make everyone happy. 
---
Sometimes you follow a design pattern and stick with it, they screwed up mid WotlK. 
---
Lets say that this team, who is different, with different vision starts making changes. You start giving ideas, and you get the polls going. you get 70% for that and 30% against that. Multiply this by every time they decide to that it's time for additions. 
---
In time you get "BFA", and here we go again "i liked it before, pls servers".
---
Just release the game and let it die with dignity. Making them work on 2 different MMOS while they can't even fix their damn Retail sounds ludicrous.
---
Thing is, everyone in their hear think that they found the perfect solution, but at the same time someone else disagrees. Do i trust a company that drove me to want Classic in a first place with actually keeping the vanilla spirit with new content? Well...no.
---
However in the spirit of the thread (as always) here is my opinion (which many will find wrong, and that's the whole point im trying to make) 3 years seasonal server resets.
---
Diablo 3 basically.
---
LOL! You DID move the goal posts hahahahaha!!! Your exact words were “there are no 5s” and “will get shit stomped by higher tier raid gear” - NOW you’re on about “launch” hahaha!  You have a great day too, thanks for the entertainment :)

---
Well yeah, it will all be for nothing when Classic releases in a few months, why bother when you can just wait for it
---
With sharding in place, the bigger issue may be that second zone then. 
---
Really, however you cook it, the people who play more and can follow whatever route are gonna be the people hit cap in the first week. Saving a few hours at the start isn't going to make a HUGE difference.
---
It's not just starting zones though.
---
I made the same experience. I will try to bring a bit of classic back to retail until it launches like you did :) 
---
Props to you :)
---
Sounds interesting, what does the job actually consist of?
---
yea atiesh is hardest then ashbringer, you have to look not at the actual cost of materials, but the time/skill cost of getting to end of naxx
---
Going through my history to try to find something to attack me on? The work of someone with no ground to stand on with their arguement.
---
I'm in the same boat, with wanting to be able to bring it with me on trips where I'll have hotel room downtime, trying to LAN-party with buddies at their houses or at coffee/game shops, etc.   
---
Still, my techie friends all yell at me that I'm making a mistake if I buy a laptop, because a desktop is more powerful and can be reliably upgraded in the future.  
---
I'm likewise torn. A more perfect experience at home, or a less perfect experience than can be had in more places than only home?
---
Playing a Destro Lock in WoD was a lot of fun to me, building up you Chaos Bolt to demolish an enemy Mage was the best feeling. I had to problem playing Destro in PvP for that version of the game, however I'm not sure the similarities and differences between that Warlock and the Vanilla destro lock. Will it have the same glass cannon, nuke feel in PvP? And is it viable in endgame PvE such as raids?
---
I think this is such a minor thing no one cares. I really didn't care either way but was working on an app for classic and was curious if it be around
---
Not very easy to play outside raids with a guild at all. You need good/motivated players, and match times. In fact most skilled players in mythic plus during Legion, rarely were from the same guild. Not on little servers at least. So you are not the exception. Anyway i was talking about ignorance of retail players which is very diffuse.
---
I just got the 10 slot ooze bag and am super happy about it (pserver for now)
---
As somebody that only played during Vanilla, despite seeing it being mentioned on forums for years, I still have no clue what item level is lol.
---
an endless amount of time does not equal 'easy farm status naxx' 40 people still need to put in time and gear up and farm up to do it
---
Thanks, I'll look it up and read into it.
---
People never seem to have a unified understanding of what “casual” means. I’ve seen it applied to everything from “guy who doesn’t raid” to “guy who only plays a couple hours after work” to “guy who doesn’t know what Sunder is or why it’s useful.”
---
The problem with retail WoW isn’t that it’s “for casuals;” like you said, it’s ALWAYS been for casuals. The problem with retail WoW is twofold.
---
1. They’ve dumbed the game down to the point that a 3-year-old can play it. You have half a dozen attacks, and can do decent damage/threat just hitting buttons when they light up. Threat is nonexistent as a mechanic. Talents have been chopped down to the point that you pretty much can’t screw them up.
---
2. They made their monetization WAY too obvious. I mean, it is a business, so no duh they want money. But they’ve obviously decided that the gambling-addict Las Vegas model is the one they want to emulate with random Azerite traits, random titan/warforging, lootbox sales, and more. There’s only so many times the average player is willing to hit the slot machine before they decide it’s just not worth it.
---
bis for the raid group, gotta take one for the team
---
i like the t3 color personally
---
it got some big flaws, https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVrfz0xo this will do much better.
---
The typical statement is that you cant afford a mount at 40 (I know, there are ways you can, but they all seem to involve AH)
---
My dreams usually revolve around obtaining the game, but something distracts me, making me never get to play it.
---
Well Naxx will be cleared on Day 1, as last seen this week with a privat server, furthermore a lot more people will see Naxx in classic than back in the days.
---
Daily reminder that we read this every day and that is why we discredit a lot of YouTube creators, see tipsout.
---
&gt; /played for a character will be substantially more than 1-2 days, which is how much time it takes to get to 20 casually.
---
And if I get there in 9 hours instead of 24-48, I'll have a pretty much competition-free time from 20-60.
---
Or low effort meme
---
Everything freezes up and rubber bands. [This is the video I was referencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAlTrPySgtQ). He compares it to world PvP on a private server at the end.
---
Yeah, I've experienced this myself in incursions. It just blows my mind how 15 years later, 40v40s are just impossible despite only being limited by technology back in 2004. It's just unacceptable to me. That's what the game is all about, this shouldn't be happening.   
---
I read somewhere in r/wow that it might be due to the amount of procs and stuff the game has to track now, debuffs and effects updating on your stats constantly, etc. I don't know. I don't feel like the trade-off is worth it.
---
rofl, ele shaman is literally the highest burst in the game...
---
I was just watching his stuff last night. How does be have so much content without ever playing retail launch? Private server god??
---
The thing is, modern WoW is not exactly bad, but as people have pointed out, it's just not the same game and does not have the same feel as it once did. But it's modern WoW that really gave me the opportunity to at least experience all the content that was made for it, even if I had to play it in an easier baby mode in a PUG raid group. As a casual player, I'm actually honestly okay with that, but I think in giving people that choice, it also creates a wall much sooner for people. I've not actually played bfa. I last played when Legion first released, I discovered my beloved Survival Hunter had been completely changed to a play style I hated, and did not get on with Marksmanship, so that char lost it's appeal for me that I had spent ungodly amounts of time playing, and my Enh Shaman was great, but once I had got to top level and run some pugs, I felt like I had seen it all and just stopped playing. Now this is probably a good thing, as it means I can have a life and still say I experienced the game, but it did feel a bit empty for me. I didn't leave WoW with a positive emotional attachment or feeling to it. The world is too big and empty feeling now, so all sense of community has completely gone from the game. The disparity between levels is just ridiculous, so World PvP is absolute hell (and hence why I moved to PvE realms). The numbers no longer mean anything as they are just too big, so I feel absolutely no interest in spending time on getting something with a few more agil stats because it's like a drop in the ocean.   
---
I played back in the day during vanilla, but always as a class that didn't get much love in groups or raids (Enh Shaman), as these things had so much more importance on raid or dungeon dynamic compared to now. I have no interest in healing, tanking or casting so I was always on the backburner as a DPS that wasn't as hard hitting as some other classes in PvE. Because of this, my PvE experience in Vanilla was actually terrible, as I didn't experience any of it. The thing for me, the trade off was actually good, because PvP back then was so much better than it is now. World PvP didn't have such a huge level disparity.  Hell I killed 60s with a twink 49 in vanilla, imagine trying to kill a level 120 as a 110 now. The BGs weren't full of people who have got full PvP sets full of shit like resilience, that makes them feel like raid bosses vs regular geared players. You could jump into a BG in vanilla with regular gear and still do damage and kill people. It felt a lot more skill based. In fact you even had PvP gear that wasn't like top spec stuff, but you'd find obscure trinkets and things that did niche things to help in certain situations. The balance was just so much better back then. Also the fact that each side had like their own special weapon. The Alliance had their Paladins, and the Horde had Shamans, so there was a different experience of play style depending on what faction you played on.
---
This is like going on a Hilary Clinton subreddit and making a post called ‘DAE Orange Man Bad??!1’ lol
---
We get it that’s why we’re subbed here
---
Tipsout didn’t even play vanilla did he? Or if he did wasn’t it to only lvl 30?  Why do we even watch to any of his videos?
---
"We"? Don't talk for me you sissy ass kid.
---
He never played vanilla at all.
---
It had a particle effect, you know. A flock of ravens would surround the wielder's head.
---
At the time it was popular in games like destiny
---
People don't want to see a +5 stamina upgrade from jumping tiers.  Big numbers are sexier and now they have to stat squish every other expansion.  No idea how they thought going from 6k dps to 2million dps in 3 expansions was a good idea.
---
Was Still Searching out then? Man I feel old. Senses Fail, Alkaline Trio, Sum41, Hawthorne Heights, Good Charlotte, blink-182, simple plan, all the stuff I listened to in 2004-2006.
---
So addons in grey color are there just to indicate that they are confirmed to not be updated/remade for Classic WoW?
---
Ironweave set. It drops from Dungeon 2 set boss summons, though, so it's not in the game until phase 5: [https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=520](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=520)
---
I wouldn't recommend tanking any kind of NPC with a Shadow Priest. Their damage is bottom of the barrel, they run out of mana extremely quickly, and they have no threat modifiers, which means that any class that can out damage them will pull threat (read: literally all of them). It could be interesting in PvP, though.
---
You misread what he said
---
How much/Where might I be able to pitch the idea?
---
Oh I know, shadow meld is wonderful but flippy jump is master race.
---
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about, high level M+ pulls or mythic raids in BFA are way more mechanically complex and challenging than anything in vanilla. Pretty much all vanilla bosses are tank and spank.
---
I will always remember questing while listening to  the Morning View album from Incubus. Whenever I hear I think of Kalimdor.
---
Give some reasonings/proof for your claim. As this post is now, just seems like a recationary response to something you do not like. 
---
&gt; There's so much conflicting information going around these posts and most of it seems to come from the misconception that private servers = The same experience as rolling a character at the launch of the game back in the day. This is wrong.
---
Don't think many people are saying its 1=1, people are expressing the trends they are experienceing and informing others of these trends. Also the oarginal launch is not going to be the same experience from individual to individual, you habe no right to tell others how they experience something...
---
&gt; If you never played at launch you just dont know. 
---
What about all the people who played at launch and play private servers now, you don't see them saying how exceptinally off private severs are from the launch experience. How much private server experience/ launch experience do you have?
---
100% with you on that! I have the demanding job, where I can’t really play till after 6pm, 2 kids 7 &amp; 5 yrs old, so love playing with them when I get home, and a wife who likes to be sociable when we watch tv after the kids are down. So it’s gotta be a gaming laptop for me too. 
---
I hope to squeeze in an hour or so at work, even if that’s fishing/cooking or vendoring/AH time, so that when I am home I can play / grind / level easily from the sofa or such. 👍
---
I would try to get ahold of developers by looking at the authors of addons you enjoy the design of and then contacting them. Not sure at all on what it might cost to hire someone to do this, you could discuss it with the author.
---
Over ilvl 405 int &gt; all. Just stick haste on your rings and max ilvl.
---
They could have bloody finished it...
---
And if you don't leave starting zone with 50-60 herbalism you won't be able to harvest half the stuff in your 10-20 zone :)
---
ah yes, that evil enemy night elf who shares a connection with you through the cenarion circle.  that undead dude whose faction experiments with disease and poison on a tauren girl is my friend
---
Talent points is and will always be my biggest rage boner for WoW.
---
I look back on legion sort of fondly due to how simple the game became. Instead of all my bars being full of spells, there were maybe 10-15 abilities I would use and my UI was super clean. This made me happy, but it couldn’t keep me in the game when my routine became endless world questing/dungeon running. The dungeons weren’t even that interesting and mythic+10-15 were a bit tough but it was about time rather than skill. All this led to me quitting the game just before BFA. Classic will be the polar opposite, which is something I’ve been looking for in WoW through private servers, but now we will have the support of the creators.
---
Well, we don't know yet to what extend sharding will be used.
---
But yeah, I agree. The timings in the beginning are negligible, and you can easily get screwed over by random things like login queues and server crashes. In the end of the day, if you have practiced a solid route with proper weapon progression and are ready to put in the time, you'll end up on the top.
---
Did people still farm MCP through BC?
---
You do raid as Destro pretty much so you’re set there. In PvP yes it’s fairly glass cannony, imo it requires good usage of your succubus, which my buddy excelled at.
---
Right, but whereas the Vanilla experience felt like more of a date where you could at least get a word in on your value m.io is more like being a Male on Tinder. Especially if you're dps.
---
not sure 60 in the first week is really realistic but even if it were those people are not going to have really any competition at all nor will they be your competitor. If you're 60 in the first 2 1/2 weeks you probably played mostly alone throughout the entirety of 20-60 save for the few others who also poop socked their way to that achievement. But what you do during the first couple days will matter, if you play consistently. If you get yourself a healthy lead you will find yourself having a much less congested experience throughout, which is my main goal.
---
&gt; If you never played at launch you just dont know.
---
GTFO with this snobbery.
---
If only TB to Org zep were in 1.12.
---
Just wanted to say I watched your introduction episode. It was amazing. But it is unlisted from youtube. I don't know if this intentional or not. Just wanted to let you know!
---
&gt; Is there a database or tool somewhere out there, with a recording of all AH transactions that you can sift through? 
---
From vanilla?
---
I would like to know that too

**&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail.  We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured.  To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization.  We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience.  Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS.  In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended.  In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks.  Please refer to the Charter at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this.  We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience.  Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
Tuesdays:  6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays:  6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule.  With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions.  
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter.  The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading.  May you find your perfect guild!
---
People say flying in the old world, but I tend to disagree with this. I think that constantly every expansion sort of needs to take the character to a far off place, but Cata really only had a couple new large zones, and one zone was pretty unplayable to be fair.
---
Not sure if other people agree with me at all. 
---
But I quit Cata the moment I stepped in and replaced a Heroic ICC cloak with a green cloak from Cata where the stats went from +30 sta, +10 str in ICC to +1000 sta, + 300 str in Cata.
---
Not sure why, but that rubbed me the wrong way. I came back a few months later and played for a while, but it been like... Expansion comes out, I buy it... I play it for 2 months, then I quit again.
---
If you want to *heal* in pvp, then druid might not be the best choice. They aren't really efficient pvp healers. If your main goal is to heal in pvp, with a side of dps, then priest or paladin might be better for you. Paladins are gods in healing pvp, and ret can be fun. Priests are really good in pvp with mana burns and efficient healing, and spriests are a whole 'nother level of face melting compared to druid/paladin dps.
---
This sub basically "made" tips. Back in the early days he was very popular around here. Then he started talking out of his ass increasingly often and these days most people on the subreddit are completely sick of how clueless he is. 
---
However, the damage is mostly done, as he is one of the biggest classic wow youtubers and a lot of people still unfortunately believe what he says.
---
**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**
---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST Wednesday/Thursday
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
Recruitment: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for **all roles** if you are an exceptional, dedicated player. 
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: [https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)
---
**Contact**: Here's how to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before applying:

---
Yeah I’m leaving my private server and going all in on Classic.
---
You clearly never did MC or BWL. They were anything but tank and spank. The 40 person group had to have very specific duties and tasks divided up and each person had to fulfill their role or the group would wipe.
---
This is gonna be an amazing adventure.
---
From private servers, I assume no one has access to the vanilla data.
---
Lighten up, man. It's just hyperbole and people blowing off steam about something they're excited for. No need to take it so seriously.
---
Energy drink and Depends. No life for first 48 hours.
---
I feel like this is the only real tactic.
---
Arms Warrior works fine, it's in no way the best choice for PvE (blast for PvP) but it's doable given you got decent gear and a supporting guild.
---
It does sound snobby, sorry for that.
---
Easy, just say you're here for an interview and ask where to park, and once you get inside, go all ninja.
---
Works as long as you don't use your own car =)
---
The wow model seems to be more geared towards item progression with small dopamine hits. It’s like an upscale candy crush
---
Then why does anyone listen to his opinions? I’ve watched some of his videos, 90% of it is just him reading a blue post and talking about things he doesn’t know.
---
Play Kenshi whilst you wait that’s what I’m doing, only game that’s managed to hook me till then, it’s an absolutely huge and brutal RPG id seriously recommend it
---
&gt; But even if you speedlevel 1-20 won't be a big slice out of that to warrant such theorycrafting. 40-60 takes way more time, thus it would be logical to optimize that more.
---
Both matter.
---
- 12 hour 1-20 can lead to 110 hour 20-60 being ahead of the pack
---
- 24 hour 1-20 can lead to 130 hour 20-60 being stuck in the pack.
---
Imagine how many black lotuses you can farm with an extra 32 hours? How many Lava jump runs can you do to get BIS before your peers catch up?
---
tbh among the people I played with that wasn't even considered high.
---
What does this have to do with classic?
---
**&lt;Credendum&gt;** **EU \[PvP\] | Alliance**
---
*Are  you from Norway? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children?  Career? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious  guild without any obligations.*
---
**Guild Information:**  Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who’ve  matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities.  Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids,  going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your  microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept.  Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other  way around. It doesn’t matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week,  there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be  hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature  individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We  probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the  kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace  that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members.  There will also be a signifcant amount of PvP with premade guild groups.  Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.
---
**What we expect from our members:**  In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want  it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more  "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully  prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected  to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if  you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like  Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.   
---
**PvP Premades:** Will be lead by players with rank13/14 experience from vanilla and private servers.    
---
Visit [https://credendum.eu/](https://credendum.eu/) and/or join us on our Discord: [https://discord.gg/SCva9VM](https://discord.gg/SCva9VM)
---
Nothing dishonest about total war, though.   
---
The PvE servers are going to be there for people who don't want the same risk:reward ratio.   
---
For those doing PvP servers, however, I cannot argue with the perspective that what ultimately determines which faction wins that server is a culmination of actions up to and including killing anyone with a red name. There can be no doubt that killing someone causes their questing to take more time, that their questing taking more time means their leveling takes more time, and that their leveling taking more time means that they'll be slower to acquire end-game PvP and PvE gear.   
---
\^\^ Negatively impacting the enemy faction member's rise to power as outlined above \*is\* what it means to be winning the server-wide tug-of-war.
---
Not sure why you are downvoted. Its the only sensible option in Classic unless you really know what you are doing. In that case you can aoe grind.
---
Well hell no i leveled couple characters 1-60 only in private servers but i dint want to burn myself before the real deal,also  private servers are shit, buggy and unreliable i will never put the effort i would put  in a classic server, because you know pservers are like the the wind, today is here for tomorrow you never know. 
---
So if i am gonna put up 12h+ a day in a game its beret to know when i wake up tomorrow my effort wont me for nothing and server wont be just deleted and website says" 404 Page doesn't exists" 
---
Just my opinion as Hardcore gamer ( some would say European Elitist \^-\^ )
---
This is why joining a guild is so important. Look for a guild that is at your skill level. If you're 9/9H 1/9M, look for a guild that is progressing on Grong/Jadefire. If you find a group of people you enjoy playing with, the whole experience is a lot more fun.
---
I can’t recall where I read this, or even if it’s true. But I remember people saying after playing the demo how it seemed much better lag-wise than retail because how few particles the spells in vanilla were making, which is the main reason why the current game gets so laggy when 80+ people cast spells, they said.
---
Too lazy to go read blue posts themselves probably? I can't speak for others.
---
Good for him I guess. I'd imagine he'll have a lot more content competition closer to release.
---
While I’m not obsessed with getting past the 1-10 phase (it tends to be fun), I am practicing to get through it faster than I would without any preparation.
---
/sign
---
Oh okay cool
---
Here's the other problem: people that *did* play Vanilla, myself included, do not have infallible memories. It's so hard to remember all the little details of the game back then; that was 12-15 years ago. So, I absolutely agree that playing on a private server is not the same experience as playing retail Vanilla was, but I'd also argue that retail Vanilla players aren't flawless beacons of Vanilla knowledge, either.
---
Check out his post history.
---
No, he's not okay.
---
Its funny. We all love Vanilla and treat it as sacrosanct, but its really broken lol. It was a work in progress, and they wanted to iterate over it so many more times. Listening to Kevin Jordan, one of the 3 Game Designers and basically the  person designing spells available for all classes in Vanilla, he mentions how Hybrids were never meant to be healbots. He mentions how they envisioned paladins and druids healing and tanking and dpsing in raids and being viable along side the warriors, mages, rogues etc. Its sad they never got to push those class changes that eventually made 2.0.1 to Vanilla.
---
&gt;From not knowing if your next melee swing will do 100 or 2000 damage, to having to frustrate your fellow warriors by rolling on warrior gear, Ret has shown us time and time again that it's a subpar spec.
---
But you dont want Warrior gear. You want spellpower items.
---
People try to play Paladin like it's a warrior and gear for physical stats, despite those stats only affecting one ability ( Seal of Command ). Every other ability scale off of spellpower.
---
How does anger management help generate rage in combat?
---
Sorry, this really doesn't relate to Classic and has been removed.
---
I've been on this sub for 2 days and have seen references to front stabbing, sit crit macros,  and a fair amount of misrepresentation for class viability in end game raids.
---
Okay that makes sense. Thank you
---
it's cool. I make plenty of posts that I cringe over later. We're all excited about classic and I agree launch was special.
---
same here. only go online to test something for classic
---
It changed everything classic into a new game.
---
100% agree. I'm referencing a lot myself.
---
I’ll probably just choose whatever the people I know irl choose lol
---
Druid is a very strong quester/leveler, and its lack of gear dependency means it is extremely strong in all dungeon roles while leveling (except for balance, stay away).
---
I would say that while it is decent for soloing it really doesn't touch hunter. It can't solo farm entire dungeons the way that a good hunter can, and will usually not be able to solo elite (read: group) quests. Not a bad pick, but it just depends on where your priorities are.
---
Well please link us a source for this then. Because I'm pretty sure it hasn't been confirmed.
---
Yes, but he probably doesn't want a ret paladin at all if he can avoid it.
---
So you just run away until you can los. Dont be that idiot who just run in a straight line after people you can never catch up to.
---
Druids are a strong solo class, but nothing really can touch the hunter in that regard. Solo farming Mara or DM N is not something that can be replicated by any other class.
---
Yes, since cata/mop eveey zone has an acm "quests in x". The loremaster(s) is/are the meta acm for those.
---
found a bug where you can get the level 40 talent stormstrike at level 35. dunno why but it unlocks too early.
---
Mindcontrol stealth seems very appealing for PVP. Overrated?
---
The best and worst part haha
---
Not even every server had them but yes they did exist, of course they did. The point is that most raiding guilds on private servers are like that.
---
Most guilds that aren't delusional about their status will test/trial someone even if they are lower iLvL. You can get to 405-ish with very minimal grinding (casual levels of time investment). I think a lot of people just set unrealistic expectations about the type of guild they're looking to join. For instance, if you haven't cleared 9/9H you shouldn't be applying to 3-4/9M guilds. Play to your level.
---
As for the AP grind, it only really exists at the highest level (ie. world top 500). Once you get all of your second outer ring azerite traits you're pretty much good to go. I'm progging on Mekkatorque (6/9) right now and consistently parse within top 5%. My neck level is dog shit.
---
Which is a big part why im considering Tailoring for my main.
---
I'm old even among the classic crowd now. Bummer.
---
Decontamination and cleaning of different systems etc. If you're into the technical aspects of nuclear power plants and think contamination/radiation is interesting then it's quite fun, for some time at least. If not, then it sucks. I want to be an nuclear engineer and are fascinated by "dangerous" things so I think its cool as hell.
---
Might become an engineer in Wow instead though, time will tell.
---
I really should start making guides or at least some videos. I have a hard drive full of server first Mc Naxx AQ and Naxx raids from vanilla. Also have experience leveling 5 toons to cap. 
---
That said I am far too lazy.
---
It's because none of it is true
---
We also played at a different time, so perceptions of good/bad tend to be a bit different than the private server crowd.  In general most things should be taken with a grain of salt if you're evaluating based on numbers/etc
---
&gt; not an MMO
---
Fucking  THANK YOU. The other day someone tried to argue "any game can be anything". No, that's not how categories work.
---
I think this is the most dangerous part of Pservers is they are similar enough to the real thing they give people a false sense of knowledge about what they think classic will be.  I completely agree they have things way off as far as mob health, attacks, resistances.
---
I have a sinking feeling it is going to make a fair number of Pserver players quite when they find out the things that worked on Pservers aren't as good in classic.
---
Though, it is going to hurt my monkey brain when there's greens/rares that are better than epics in Classic due to yolo itemization planning.
---
Yeah...preventing yourself as well
---
It also makes playing on a private server seem so pointless. I'm trying out classes on a 5x exp server to see what kind of alt I want to go for and it just makes all time spent feel like a waste when I know i'm going to abandon these characters as soon as Classic drops. Part of the fun of WoW is feeling like you're building on something and i dont' get that with private servers now that classic is coming.
---
A lot of it was just continuation of mistakes made in Wrath. I think dropping the raid max from 40 to 25 for the big ones and 20-10 for the smaller ones was a good change in TBC. I think giving every raid a 10 or 25 version was a bad change in Wrath and this was continued in Cata. I also don't like the multiple difficulties for raids where you end up with like 4 different raid difficulties that all have the same exact loot with stats just slightly adjusted.
---
Introductory and catchup raids should be 10 man, other raids 25 man. Tune them to be difficult to start with, you can always nerf them a bit if you need to. Once the next tier comes out or has been out for a bit you can nerf the old tier a bit to allow stragglers to catch up easier if you want to. Or just make catchup raids/dungeons.
---
No LFR (no surprise here). Raids should be hard. They should require more coordination that an average PuG can muster. They should require teamwork, not just queuing up and getting purples without having to interact with your group members.
---
Transmog was dumb. Stop catering to every single thing people whine about. There's no way a significant amount of players quit because they couldn't look this way or that way and there's also no way transmog was the reason a significant amount of players decided to stay subbed instead of quit. Design cool armor/weps. Not everyone is going to like it every tier, but that's tough shit. I thought the Zul Aman stuff looked dumb, but I wore it until I got an upgrade just like every single other person did when they thought a set looked dumb.
---
The talent system was one of the better parts of WoW, I have no idea why they decided to remove content from it. It made no sense. I didn't like a lot of the reworked world, but I understand why they did it. Past expansions had made Azeroth a ghost town and they were trying to liven it up. This is more an issue with each expansion making the previous expansion's world irrelevant. They tried to fix that a bit, but I think it was past saving.
---
Yeah, we'll have to hope so. Influencers have a lot of sway and Tips unfortunately just blindly believes everything he hears, no matter how easy it is to disprove.
---
Errr, you realize you’re really, really late to this scene right? Where were you in the five years that thousands of people with personal vanilla experience were collaborating to replicate the original as closely as possible with contemporaneous evidentiary authority? There are some inconsistencies, yes, but the emulation is extremely good overall. 
---
Class viability won’t be much different. Is there something you have in mind?
---
Dude, get after it! There will never be a better time.
---
We literally have video evidence that sitting for reck stacks was a thing in classic. Whether it was a thing in the exact patch 1.12 - 2½ month time frame is neither confirmed nor proven false at this point.
---
I have that itch from the day Vanilla ended, been a pretty hard 15 years.
---
If you want a challenge try doing what you did as a tank. At the end of legion I came back to my WoD blood dk and challenged myself to level to 110 and clear the current raid on heroic as fast as possible in pugs. I ended up learning a truly ridiculous amount of mechanics in order to be able to competently tank heroic and all M+15s 2/3 weeks after I came back.
---
I've never played classic before and therefore do not know much, what specifically makes this build better than the one above?
---
But your soul is young, I am sure.
---
And yet, last MDI I watched was just group and AoE them down
---
&gt; more mechanically complex
---
I mean, sure. But when I cant tell what's going in because my screen is full of effects, what's the point?
---
The first few levels really just fly by, so I don't think any class will have enough advance on that part to matter. I'm going with hunter since I am planning on leveling on any ways to do Mara runs with.
---
i never truly realised it but this is exactly why i hate modern mmo’s. i cannot play every week, and for sure i cannot play every day (screw dailies). i am so looking forward to getting lost and not progressing at all for days but still having a good time because the stress is non existant
---
For the Horde, yeah. I think. I haven't played the newest raid since I unsubbed after my guild was stuck on mythic Zul, but the raid was split into Alliance and Horde versions, with the Alliance-only/Horde-only bosses being available post-raid for completion and loot and whatnot.
---
&gt; But I have absolutely no desire in doing so because I've seen the content. 
---
This does make alot of sense, and I think its what the mainly overlooked diffrence is between retail and classic. In retail, the content, and how well you do in it, increases the gear you get. In classic, the gear increases the content you can do, and how well. Thats at least my view on it. This attracts both some of the same, and different types of players. I like both.  
---
That said, there is a void of items that arent SPECIAL (like  [Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall))  these days. It seems they're trying to bring that back with the newest mini-raid and in the next patch, but we've got a long ways to go. Classic will fill that Void, until hopefully, the game is at a semi-Wrath/Legion level.
---
Well only three classes have fears (well, four if you count Hunters scaring beasts...), and I believe only the Succubus charms. A lot more, including Rogues and Paladins, can stun, so I can see the benefit to Hardiness for sure.
---
&gt; wild guesses
---
This sounds like an educated guess though?
---
I quit for good toward the middle of Cata. The things that kept me going were true hybrid viability (I've always loved hybrid classes), Archaeology as a timesink, and the bitching appearance of Troll Druids.
---
But there was a real dark side to hybrid viability in the form of homogenized talent trees. It was the first time that classes began to feel "samey"—a trend that never stopped. Inflation of gear stats and gold acquisition were also bad, and as convenient as flying mounts were in Azeroth, they also felt isolating.
---
The major drawback in the game was that they shifted too much toward "Convenience" on the Convenience v. Community scale. Instant gratification for group forming and looting meant that there was no server integrity anymore. In Vanilla and BC, I was a well-known enough player on my server that not only would my own faction immediately recognize my character names, but the *opposing faction* would recognize me. And I'd recognize them, too. I knew people. By Cata, almost all such cohesiveness had disappeared. I was an unknown, and those around me were unknowns to me. I was so ecstatic when I by happenstance found out that another Druid was one of my old PvP partners in BC that the memory of that conversation sticks with me nearly a decade later.
---
There are games where I don't expect community and don't need it. I don't care about community in a game like Path of Exile, for instance, even if it ostensibly has other players. It is in essence a single player game. But MMOs are *supposed* to be multiplayer. It's in the frigging name. And Blizzard's design choices from Cata onward violated that simple principle more and more and more in pursuit of short-term monetary gain from mayfly casuals.
---
Reminds me of the whole gearscore thing in wotlk. Literally being denied from raids if you were too low. Didn't matter if you've cleared the raid on heroic on 6 different characters, you didn't have the number so therefore you're not good enough.
---
If you are a warrior or any other weapon dependent class, make sure you get the weapon upgrades you need. It's worth going out of your way for.
---
Dota 2 is actually more complicated than BfA; and most heroes in Dota 2 have only four abilities.
---
When we played vanilla, most of what we did was with other talents, no guides, no min/max. But these people playing private servers, are still closer to telling you what will work in Classic, more than us Oldtimer can.   
---
Private Server players, are playing on 1.12 with guides, videos, spreadsheets and knowledge. Things that we did not have when we played it the first time, the game has changed. You might think *" -  If you never played at launch you just dont know. "* what they dont know is how the game **WAS** but that is not the game we are getting, we are getting a game that is much closer to private servers than vanilla.

Windfury OP
---
Judgment. Crusader Strike. Crusader strike. Templar's Verdict.
---
Very complex. I miss managing seals/judgments.
---
Honestly getting tired of the, “PrIIvaTe SERveRs ArEnT vaNiLLa” posts. We get it, you’re enlightened. We spoiled classic because we played private servers, everything is bugged and undertuned, we’re elitist min-maxers yadda yadda yadda
---
I ran the succubus and it helped a ton. If its pretty similar, I guess I might stick to Destro then. Still unsure, but if I roll Warlock I'm going destro.
---
You don't PvP as full combat that's just stupid. You go sub to prep then assassinaton for cold blood.
---
There will be sharding and it probably wont be as bad as you think
---
Do you have some more info on Arms Warriors?
---
Dude same, I’m trying to fill the void with games I’ve never played until classic comes out and I can grow out my neck beard.
---
&gt; Originally I wanted to play Destruction spec for Classic but I'm not sure how viable that will be in PvE and PvP in Classic. 
---
For lock PvE you generally have two raidable choices, and both work fairly well for PvP. DS/Ruin has an advantage over SM/Ruin in PvE generally though. 
---
1. SM/Ruin -  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z) 
---
   1. More group utility (Bloodpact, firesheild)
---
   2. More mobility (Affliction based)
---
   3. More CC Utility (Curse of Exhuastion)
---
   4. Higher multi-target damage
---
2. DS/Ruin -  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ix0bZfx0zThoZvx0tM0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ix0bZfx0zThoZvx0tM0z) 
---
   1. Demon Sacrifice
---
   2. More survivalbility 
---
   3. Better Healthstones
---
   4. Higher single-target damage
---
No, we are a Classic WoW only guild.
---
You right
---
It’s called an opinion. We’re allowed to have them just as you’re allowed to have yours of my opinion. Nothing toxic about that.
---
yeah that’s extremely wrong lol. I started BfA like two weeks ago and hit 120 and have been running mythical, highest one i’ve was a mythic 12 I think? but anyway everyone i’ve done is mindless, boring, and just lame. maybe a little challenging, but not fun or “mechanically complex” at all. it’s just a bunch of bullshit “challenges/debuts or whatever you’d call them thrown into a dungeon. that’s complex? lol
---
LW is amazing because of Green Whelp Armor AKA druid flag carrier insta win armor lol
---
Chance on being hit to put attacker to sleep
---
Stagnating would just slowly kill the game. It's worse. And it would be very selfish to tell those who would want to play Classic first time in e.g. 2021, that they are out of luck and won't ever experience AQ event. They resurrecting Classic, so everyone would relive the game to some extent. Everyone, not only those who will jump at summer.
---
Wut? Classic without global cooldowns would be like WW2 with jet packs.
---
Personally I will be playing priest, so wands are nearly just as important. I got my excel spreadsheets all set up on my wand progression. 
---
Planning out your route is probably important to take into account what the rewards will be.

---
That’s what I thought. I figured that would be too much as well.
---
Cataclysm was the end of classic WOW's era and I was interested in what classic players thought were the important failings it had relative to classic.
---
Mods have removed this now, so whatever.
---
You mean...guides to help people acquire the single most scarce resource in Classic WoW?
---
Inorite, the fucking nerve of some people.
---
&gt; You have to compete with Fury Warris for most gear,
---
You get Tier 2 (no competition) and spell power gear, there's nothing fury warriors want that I want, let them have it.
---
True, people do want to see the big improvements. I think it's also more systemic than that. Progression at end game now is more like a straight line - once the new tier and new catch ups are out everything previous is worthless. Even in WOTLK you could do catch up content right into starting IC. 
---
This might just be nostalgia speaking, but I feel like even TBC which had some catch ups mechanics focused more on building out a progression pyramid. More options to gear up and more stops along the way rather than just wiping the slate clean every raid release.
---
Those MDI pulls are hard, it requires alot of coordinations between all party members when it comes to CC and CD.
---
I have absolutely no problem seeing what is happening in M+ or in mythic raids during mechanics. Sounds more like a you problem.
---
I'm gonna assume you don't mythic raid or do high keys yourself right? I can definitely see how someone who doesn't do the content would think it's nonsense and not know what is happening.
---
Look do I have my problems with BFA? Yeah, alot actually. Do I like vanilla more? On alot of things yes. Will I play both? Also yes. 
---
But this revisionist history going on in this Reddit needs to stop. Vanilla raids and dungeons will never be harder than current mythic raids, mechanically or otherwise. (TBC and WotLK are different).
---
&gt; it's a "we" and not a "they" that caused this.
---
I remember being happy when defense was removed as a stat, since it was a pain to hit just the right amount of it. If you went above 425, it was seen as a waste of stats since you'd only get a small amount of parry/dodge/block from it.
---
Looking back, the use of gems to stay right on the line of being crit immune without going too much higher than the defense cap was better than simply removing the stat completely.
---
I’m 27, pretty sure I was 13 when wow released and 14 when I started playing BC?
---
Any chance you could enter the item ID and it could pull based off of that rather than the exact item name?
---
The *real* Battle for Azeroth!
---
My bad. I dont think any less of someone who hasnt played it. Really hyped for the release for everyone :)
---
Ok, but we don’t have to buy it right? So will there just be an update?
---
Ok I'll join your discord once I get back from work.  I don't play retail at the moment either but I would like to play and hangout with the group before classic drops since my biggest priority will be finding a community I like.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
This is a bunch of stuff about why Cata was bad, but I'm interested in how it could have been done well. I agree it shouldn't have made these changes, but what changes might it have benefitted from?
---
This sub has a really weird hard-on for private servers.
---
I've been dreaming of classic wow almost every night for weeks. I'm losing my mind.
---
 **Eminence** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we’ve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP based loot council loot system in order to provide the most fair and streamlined loot in raids.
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through website or through us on discord). We are 30+ members strong!
---
**Raid days and times** (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!

Not really. There's some ghosts down there that drop runecloth and greens. Favourite spot for gold farmers as the classic [Chronicles of the Gold Farmer](https://youtu.be/kMiJnVxJdko) by a young TotalBiscuit (pbuh) shows. 
---
Other than that it's just a damn creepy place and awesome for some exploration. I took my gf down there and proposed to her.
---
It took me about 5 solid days of copying and pasting from classicdb to get the data... Yeah it was boring as hell! Feel free to use it for yourself though.
---
People who play are private server are absolute scum... Only a monster would want to play vanilla wow early for free.
---
Still good though. I used to sell mine to the guys with world buffs.
---
Quick question. Is Conflagrate not used often? Because in the specs you've linked, as well as the ones I find online elsewhere, it doesn't seem to be taken. It was something I used often in WoD.
---
WutFace
---
I leveled a monk in retail with skinning LW. now, I know it isn't classic, but from 1-60 many of the recipes available are the same. By grinding on beasts between quests and whenever I'm running anywhere I had enough leather to make gear for myself that was actually an upgrade. A few times I used a database to plan out what upgrades I could reach for. Some patterns I had to buy from a specific vendor I would never have found myself. 
---
And I'm a power leveler. I recommend skinning and beast grinding on any character, but if you are a hunter druid rogue or shaman I recommend taking LW along with it and grinding beasts
---
Best to take a break now and come into Classic refreshed. I haven't played on a Private server in a few years.
---
&gt; You might think " - If you never played at launch you just dont know. " what they dont know is how the game WAS but that is not the game we are getting
---
In addition to this, Pservs may not be 100% accurate...but they aren't just flat out utterly wrong in all aspects of the game like some people assume.   The people that played 14 years ago and haven't touched WoW since are *hilariously* naive if they think they actually know more about the game than people that have been playing something that's pretty much 90%+ accurate for the last 14 years.
---
That definitely makes sense.
---
He's not a troll, he's an alt-right conspiracy goon.
---
One thing to note about private servers is that they don't have the exact numbers used in vanilla so you can't compared them 1 to 1. There may be differences that people need to adapt to that take a week or so to figure out, especially if popular strategies are no longer viable.
---
Nah man get a thorium spike on your shield for elite aoe dps!
---
That's actually really interesting to me, because the last classic patch was in 2006, and most of the game was between 2004 and 2005. Which means these two peaks coincide with players who were 11-13 for the majority of Classic. I can speak from first-hand experience that the vast majority of my own guild was *not* that age in Classic, myself included. So either the average playing age was lower in Russia, the average casual age was lower than I personally knew, or the people most excited about Classic are actually familiar with BC and have an idealized representation of Classic in their mind. I would have expected a lot more activity in the 30+ bracket if the hype about Classic was being driven by nostalgia. Of course, life gets in the way, so people who may have wanted to play or played a lot back then cannot do so now, while those in the 20-30 bracket are still likely in school, at the beginning of a career, or underemployed, so they have time to kill.
---
suggestion for horde priest race combo?
---
Mythic 12 are a joke right now, that's not a high key same with heroic raid, almost everybody is out gearing those, you are probably getting carried without you knowing it.
---
16+ is when it's hard especially if you want to time it.
---
Flying off the handle only further diminishes any credibility to your original statement...which lacked a source.
---
Which was my point. Frost mages do exactly that, even if it's for farming.
---
my hype has died off dramatically in the last two weeks. no real reason other than I got bored of waiting. I'm more interested in other games now
---
I try to be optimistic
---
Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. Frostbolt. 
---
Asides from the rotations in BFA being more complex the fight mechanics are also much more involved. I have more fun running dungeons and raids in Vanilla but its ridiculous to say rotations in 
---
BFA are less complex and involved than in Vanilla.
---
Your hype is not high enough if you are even thinking about classic flopping.
---
But not in a hack n slash manner.
---
~~This is not a PSA. fock off m8~~
---
Yes, and I'm sick of hearing it, though I look forward to playing this great game with you and peeps like you
---
This. The ingame music is just masterfully done. Sometimes I just listen to Barrens, Arathi Highlands or Tanaris music on youtube for the feels. So much nostalgia. Can't wait for Classic!
---
&gt;going to learn the route just incase dynamic spawns/sharding unfortunately show up
---
Wouldn't you want to use this method if those features *don't* show up?
---
Lol that's about what i expected unfortunately,  I applaud the effort anyways that sounds like a major chore.  Thanks! I will use it if I get going on anything and will gladly credit
---
Spell particles would cause processing lag on your computer, it doesn't affect network lag which is what Asmongold's video is showing.
---
Actually my sack is huge.
---
Well the lead designer of D3 moved to the WoW team before Legion, no big surprise...
---
Stuck looting animation and server lag for literally months, 10-15 minute rollbacks, your server down for 12 hours, constant log-in queues, zero diminishing returns (could literally perma fear or frost shock), no weapon speed normalization (arcanite reaper ho!), I do think /sit worked briefly, sword specialization one shots, shaman tanks!, locks without death Coil (aka mushrooms), and no one knew how to play or gear optimally.
---
And back in my day we called it VC not DM!
---
Ahh that’s a bummer. The weekly updates we’ve gotten lately hasn’t done it for you?
---
 [https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/](https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/)
---
Part of the issue in Destiny is not only how light level is prioritized, but how you can upgrade any gun in the game to max level by dismantling another gun into it. This is especially lame when there are certain guns that feel amazing from the very beginning of the game and you never really need to find a different gun for that slot (i.e. Origin Story). Granted there always were some new guns that were really good from each raid, but it always seemed lame that you could upgrade literally the starting weapon in the game and it would perform just as good as any other gun you could find. It removed a lot of exploration and excitement from the raiding scene imo.
---
I told my self 8 years ago I wouldn't play mmos any more, stuck by it ever since without fail... Then classic got announced.
---
Of course. 2019-27= 1992, 2004-1992=12.  (If you were born in January, then you were almost 13 years old. Without two months)  
---
but we are talking about Russia. Localization is a very important factor for players, especially for children. And the Russian language was added only in 2008.
---
I say hi in every group I get in, I've done it since vanilla. Everyone once and awhile I have nice conversations but mostly it's people who are either toxic, or elitist. Let's be honest though, it wasn't much better in vanilla. Especially on competitive high pop servers there were alot of toxic players.
---
Me exactly :(. I never played any Psevers until after Nost. But after they went down I rolled on K2 with so much excitement. Then I rolled on K3 and leveled to 60, and was having a blast. But as soon as they announced classic I lost all desire to play on anything other then official :(. I just tried to log back into the Psever yesterday (after a year or so), and still couldn't.
---
TBC did have catch up mechanics when the Sunwell came out.  That was the first time you could grind badges (Justice Points) and exchange them for really good gear.
---
Catch up mechanics now are just insane though.  I feel like I have no reason to ever play because if I want to play, I can get a competitive ilevel within a few days.  There's no reason to even do LFR or Normal raids because the gear isn't better than what you can get playing casually.  I'm not actually missing anything by not subbing.  Story maybe, but you just need to run LFR once and you're all caught up.
---
I'd be fine with 1 catch up for the final tier like in TBC, but having catch ups throughout the entire expansion is just ridiculous.  You'd keep raids relevant for longer and there'd be more progression guilds if you had to work your way through tier 1 to get to tier 2.
---
I think this is what you are after https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com
---
So in classic you will notice that gear won't have a blanketed +spell power on most caster items, generally your gear will have +shadow damage. You can specifically build a firelock spec but the gear requiered to be even closely competitive is a pain to get, and hard to convince people it should go to a lock rather than a mage. Then you have the debuff limit, some debufs/dots are simply not worth the space on the boss.
---
wHaT dO wE dO aFtEr NaXxRaMaS gUyS
---
I'll be playing healer in PvE anyway, don't think I'm an outcast as Priest lol
---
No they do, but they basically dont matter.
---
They've tied almost all of your secondary stats to your Heart of Azeroth neck, to the point that if something is an upgrade in ilvl, its a dps/hps upgrade because the intellect/stam/agi is worth more even if youre trading from BiS secondaries to worst.
---
The only items you KINDA have to think about ate rings, because they don't have primary stats, and trinkets. 
---
But that essentially ends up with you just having rings for ages
---
New mechanics =/= new content. My biggest gripe with retail is they force you to play the same boring ass content over and over with new "mechanics" because theyve done a cost benefit analysis and some chart somrwhere tells them that the people who spend the most money like that shitty content so fuck everyone else.
---
Yikes. That was bad. Ive seen that haopen before but never so consistently and for so long.
---
Diverting from the fact that there are things that make 10x more business sense than the alternative. The work of an imbecile. But it's ok to speculate about something as long as it's you talking right scrub?
---
I know I'm late to the party, why don't you feel comfortable tanking?
---
It's been like 10 days since we had any vaguely substantive news. Better to just have fun doing other things.
---
There are already a lot of others, and they actually work well.
---
WotF isn't really huge value til arenas so it's a valid argument.
---
Classic and even up to Wrath was an adventure in a rich world. They have gotten away from it. It'll be nice to go back.
---
Here's the thing, post Naxx release I would like to see official talk of fresh servers. But its important to know the effects it causes on existing servers. While it's hard to tell how retail classic players would respond (they may be more inclined to stay), pserver trends have shown when Fresh shows up it's not just some players who jump, it's the majority who do. The main problem was he was trying to present his Hope's and guesses as confirmed fact, which they are 100% not.
---
They said they are looking into it as a solution to the fact that hundreds of thousands of people will be leveling from 1 at the same time, basically.
---
I think it would also make sense for the opening of the gates of AQ.
---
It's a better solution than either the servers crashing, or people being in hours long queues.
---
This perfectly describes the problem with retail wow. 
---
It’s just a single player rat race
---
no, but I am really into things in bursts. I will come back around I bet, but right now I picked up hearthstone and am hooked
---
Okay. See you in Azeroth.
---
Thats 365 days out of two years right ? 12 hours avg a day.... what was your living situation were you could do that ?
---
&gt;That's actually really interesting to me, because the last classic patch was in 2006, and most of the game was between 2004 and 2005. Which means these two peaks coincide with players who were 11-13 for the majority of Classic. I can speak from first-hand experience that the vast majority of my own guild was   
---
&gt;not  
---
&gt; that age in Classic, myself included. So either the average playing age was lower in Russia, the average casual age was lower than I personally knew, or the people most excited about Classic are actually familiar with BC and have an idealized representation of Classic in their mind. I would have expected a lot more activity in the 30+ bracket if the hype about Classic was being driven by nostalgia. Of course, life gets in the way, so people who may have wanted to play or played a lot back then cannot do so now, while those in the 20-30 bracket are still likely in school, at the beginning of a career, or underemployed, so they have time to kill.
---
Yes, I think you are right. The main conclusion is that people waiting for the Classics in Russia have never played the classics. And met with the game only in 2008 after the release of Wrath of the Lich King
---
 **&lt;Not the Face&gt; - NA Progression / PVP Grind**
---
Server Type: PVP
---
18+ We drink, we swear, we loot. We are kinda like pirates.
---
Faction: Horde
---
We are PST leadership, raids will be at 6PM but we are flexible. The goal is to have 3 raid nights, no more. We will clear all content and keep it on farm. We have a lot of raiding experience from Vanilla to release. We don't want to spend a ton of time in raids as we will be running a 24/7 HWL Grind Team.
---
Our priority will to be the best on our server. We are NOT looking for world firsts. We are NOT looking to be the best raiders. Our goal is to be PVPers. This requires PVE in Classic. We have a few previous HWL in the guild as well as many Vanilla Naxx raiders. We need more members.
---
We are working on leveling spreadsheets, BIS "routes" and properly forming premade groups to best maximize leveling in gearing. We are try-hard has beens. That said, we have fun joke around, meme, couple streamers, gank and overall have a good time.
---
Loot will be on a hybrid Loot Council / DKP. Meaning items such as Thunderfury, Anathema etc will be decided in advance and distributed appropriately. This includes any weapon that would be benefitting the raid. Tank gear etc. This does not include hand of rag or any armor etc. 90% of loot will be DKP. Let's be real. MC has very little gear that is upgrades to pre-raid BIS.
---
* You can contact me directly @ Spun#1337 on discord if you are interested. We have a lot of spots to fill.
---
You must be the only guy who likes M+...
---
So heres what I do these days. I sub when theres new content. Usually for only a month. I feel 15 bucks is worth it for the content when its first released. After experiencing the content I unsub until the next content drop. Basically I play WoW as a single player campaign that has quarterly installments that advance the story. I'm much happier and the game stays fresh this way because I'm not killing myself grinding away at the stupid ap treadmill.
---
The reason hardiness is objectively better than wotf, among various reasons, is the number of spells each racial is effective against. 
---
WotF removes charms, fears, and sleeps. Warlocks have 2 fears, warriors have intim. shout,  and priests with  psychic scream. For charms you have succubus, mind control cap, and priest MC. Sleeps are more or less irrelevant due to their rarity. 
---
On the other hand, every single class in vanilla has access to a stun spell save warlocks and shamans. In addition, due to the fact engineering bombs are a useable item you don’t have to equip versus gnomish cap, you’ll encounter them much more frequently in PvP.
---
I’ve been playing Nintendo switch much lately, it has made me realize how awesome portable gaming devices are due to the many ways you can play them. And this is coming from someone who always played stationary before. I personally think the flexibility makes it worth it. And also, laptops have become so damn good that it ain’t that big of a loss unless you are super picky
---
Glad to hear you’re able to enjoy other games while we wait, consider me jealous haha!
---
Not the same thing dude, in vanilla it WAS possible to get stacks by spamming a sit macro really fast and occasionally get procs due to server lag, but it was unreliable and certainly not a viable leveling option.
---
It wasn't the guaranteed proc while sitting method that you see on pservers.
---
Are you seriously complaining about having to look at mechanics before doing a fight? How brain-dead do you want the fights to be that you don't have to read about them beforehand? Plenty of add-on were pretty much mandatory to raid in vanilla too.
---
Not really. People have the entire internet to find the best cheese strategy
---
Yes it's possible. Lurking this sub and asking questions like this hurt your chances at what you want to accomplish.
---
1440p 144hz better than both
---
Idk I’ve become a cynical asshole over the years. I’ll probably never get the same feelings I had back then.  But I’m sure as hell gonna try. This time I have beer
---
Yes, maybe it is just me, but it feels like this happens more and more frequently nowdays. Or maybe it is because in the past it was easier to create a network of friends online to do dungeons with, therefore there was less exposure than what happens now with the dungeon finder.
---
Anyway, I want to be optimistic about Classic!
---
Hell yeah bru. And why not plug that bad boy into the tv and grind some rep with a big ass screen if you feel like it 😎
---
Pretty much, if you are not going to raid, you can probably take some of the movespeed in cat for PvP, take 1/2 points out of thickhide for it. And you can get away with taking natures grasp at the cost of 4/5 hotw. Your not going to be min maxing in pve by the sounds of it and you can probably get away with it nicely to suit your PvP needs better. 
---
3 sets should do it, a tanking set, a healing set and a PvP set. The PvP set can be a mix and match of your pve sets for the most stam/int.
---
Otherwise your PvP gear will be basically the rank PvP set or stuff similar, such as the dungeon set legs from ?scholo? Basically had all stats on for you.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent](https://classicdb.ch/?talent) \- this too
---
Someone who didnt play vanilla can still gather good and useful information presented in a entertaining way, he just cant validate them himself and they might be flawed.
---
As long as that person doesnt declare all his content as facts, why not ?
---
There are so many sports analysts who never played the sport themselves.
---
Its a free world, no one is stopping someone (or you) with better knowledge and a more entertaining personality to create better content.
---
Would depend on how many people were trying to level in Westfall at the same time.  500 people at once would be beyond painful.
---
dont worry, the release day, servers are going to be unstable as f, constant lag, constant disconnects, massive queues, just to get that vanilla feeling back again
---
4K is only with 60Hz. this is "OK" for WoW, aber shooter for example, is on another page. 
---
I'll own a 4K 30" Display and a Titan X Pascal and get steady 60fps@4K on max settings in most games.
---
i can say, my next monitor is something like this: 
---
* Acer XB271HUAbmiprz 
---
* Asus ROG Swift PG278QR.
---
Honestly this might be the thing i'm most excited for. When I played Vanilla I rolled a PvE server wtih some friends because we were all 10 and had no idea what we were doing. Most of the content i've already seen, but the world PvP fighting is something I completely missed. Can't wait!
---
dude this sub is filled with retail man children what the fuck do you expect???
---
21:9 @ 3440x1440p only way to go
---
Ofc but I think when naxx comes out people will have played classic for about 2 years.
---
Not trying to defend anyone, but just giving a reminder that many people don’t use reddit, and in that case youtube is probably where they get their classic updates from.
---
Bingo. Dell has a nice 27" with Gsync.
---
I think I'd enjoy a pvp server, but this time around I'm going to try duo leveling with my wife, she's a complete video game novice so I feel the struggle of pve is going to be enough for her, and getting repeatedly ganked is just going to make her quit.
---
My brother ND I on the other hand have played wow till our eyes bleed and might be duo leveling on a pvp server. Whether or not server transfers are a thing will make the decision. I'd hate to be on a pvp server with my main then find out my wife loves the game and she's stuck isolated on a pve server.
---
If you cared about your guild at all you would pass it to a tank instead of being selfish.
---
Downvoted your downvote because I upvoted the OP.
---
It is totally possible but could take you a long time. Speed runners finish the game in about 4-6 days of in-game time. This means it can take casual levelers sometimes weeks to hit max level. That doesn't mean it isn't possible or fun though. You can absolutely enjoy the experience without any prior knowledge and I honestly envy how green you are. A lot of people who have played the game before, or play on private servers, get caught up in the min/maxing which to me isn't what vanilla was up.
---
I'm hoping it becomes better because it will force people to make friends, and not bring shame to their name on the server.
---
Is 1440p 2k?
---
No it doesn't.

Why do people always pull this argument out of their ass when someone calls retail out for being trash. What he said has nothing to do with the mechanical difficulty of either version of the game. I swear someone could be arguing that vanilla had a better story and retaildrones would get triggered and be like "HUR DUR VANILLA BOSSES ARE EZ THO RETAIL TAKES MORE SKILL".
---
Damn I LOVE having literally no challenge in the game until you get to mythic at 120, when your motivation for playing the game is 0 because you've already cleared that exact same content on two easier difficulties
---
I guess you could say that but i'm not 100% certain
---
Yeah I’ll probably wait a couple days to let everyone get past the starting zones
---
Unless Launch day is a Saturday then I might not be able to help myself since I have weekends off
---
I bought a laptop with a docking port so I can easily undock and play when I travel for work (1 week each month), chill at friends' houses, or at coffee shops if I want to get out of the house.
---
It was a pain in the ass trying to sync up addons, updates, settings, etc. when I had two separate computers. After replacing my desktop with a single laptop, it's been amazing.
---
Also, the 10 series laptop cards are the first that are nearly the same as the desktop versions (hardcore boiz will disagree, but they're close enough for all practical purposes). All but the most graphics intensive games on 4k Ultra settings give me issues (less than 30 fps but still playable). Most games play at 40-60 fps on ultra in 4k.  I have an MSI GS65 Thin 259.
---
Keep doing these. Just tested ur 1-12 run and it was smoooth! Gj :)
---
A lot of that is just stolen from Wowhead. You can even see it on this page - https://classicdb.ch/?guide=cwcat
---
&gt;Welcome to Wowhead's overview of classes in Classic WoW! This guide is intended for live WoW players, such as those playing the Classic WoW demo at BlizzCon, to familiarize themselves with all the class options and important mechanics. Learn about all the available classes, the intricacies of the Classic talent system, and the roles, strengths, and weaknesses for each class in our comprehensive guide.
---
Pretty shitty IMO and I wouldn't support such a site. They even use the same formatting for the tabs and things.
---
I'd use Wowhead since they actually have original content and work hard to bring in things like official demo data from Blizzcon last year for their database, as well as old comments on quests/items/database pages from Tthottbot and Allakhazam.
---
If you're referring to M+, I agree for the most part. The old challenge modes were a lot more interesting because they were more or less a one time thing where you were encouraged to find as many exploit-like skips as possible. After your 10th M+15 it gets pretty stale. But M+s are 100x better than the world quests grind, a nice centralised well-crafted daily quest hub like the molten front or the order of the cloud serpent was much better.
---
4k is just a shitty gimick. 144hz monitors are sooo much smoother.
---
Dad gamer here. I have a laptop and it’s the best. I can play while I sit in the living room with my wife and daughter. It’s still a very anti social experience but at least I’m present and I can set the laptop aside when stuff happens and I’m needed.  That being said I still really want a desktop for those raids and battlegrounds. I just don’t know if it’s justified to spend &gt;$1,000  when I already have a ~$800 laptop with a 17” screen and i7 processor that does just fine.
---
1080p is 2k, 1440p is like 2.5k, but it's a stupid term to begin with.
---
Just say 1080p, 1440p or 2160p.
---
While I agree with the first half of your statement, I don't agree with the latter half. Islands aren't even necessary gameplay. I returned to BfA about a month and a half ago after taking a break in September, and have run maybe a handful of islands in my time there, spending no more than a collective hour and a half doing the content. I have a level 48 neck, high enough to unlock the +5 ilvls on all of my azerite gear, and was able to earn it easily through doing my world quests, finishing my war campaign, and just playing the game normally. 
---
I have a lot of gripes with BfA, don't get me wrong. I hate the lack of gear identity, I don't like the lack of gear permanence, and I have a strong disdain for the disconnect between gameplay and rewards (why do world quests and AFK warfronts provide the same quality of gear as the final boss of the current raid tier on heroic difficulty??)
---
But implying grinding in BfA is needed and expected is simply not the case, and the opposite is actually true, which is what tends to bother more dedicated players. Rewards are expedited more than in any other expansion, and diverse ways of gearing are much more apparent than in any other expansions (raids, PvP, m+, world quests, warfronts, etc). 
---
Grinding is viable and has the capability of being endless, but grinding for a resource endlessly has always been a thing in WoW. You could spam run BGs for blue and epic PvP sets, with players spending like 80 hours a week for rank 14. If it's not gear, endlessly farming DM or primals in shadowmoon, or farming mounts in old dungeons in raids for gold and aesthetics. 
---
Like I said, I agree with your first statement, but don't think that BfA has turned into some grind fest that always hasn't been present in WoW. It has the potential to be endless if you want to mindlessly farm 425s in every slot, sure, but it would be incorrect to say that the majority of players bother with even attempting that style of gameplay.
---
I was thinking of switching it up for Classic (been playing Priest on a private server.) But then yesterday I got Benediction...I'm 100% playing Priest in classic haha
---
My vanilla  main (hunter) had 320+ days played. quit @ BC launch.
---
Modern WoW "mechanics" are just different color swirly things that you avoid standing in.  Whoa so hard! Mechanical intensity! Now there are 6 different things you can't stand in!! Sick, keep adding swirls on the ground and this might be the hardest game ever!
---
Who gives a shit. Modern WoW is a fucking joke.
---
I don't care how difficult your swirly avoidance game is, it has absolutely no soul.
---
While I don't doubt that BC or even Wrath could be relaunched if classic is successful, I'm not interested in playing BC. I've been waiting for the day we'd have classic servers since BC's launch and I know I'm not the only one. Not everyone is here for the space fantasy that BC brought.
---
And for those who are, they're still going to run out of content. That was the era when guilds started clearing content faster than Blizzard could put it out.
---
This poll represents a specific population. In this case we now know the age range of the Russians who joined that Facebook-analogue fan group who a.) saw the poll and b.) were willing to participate in it. We do not know anything more about the ages of players who will play Classic. 
---
I think it's Joe Rogan who has a funny observation about poll data along the lines of, "Those are just the opinions of dummies who were willing to take that poll." Now I'm not calling these people dummies but you get the point.
---
&lt;3 Right in the feels. I miss this kinda stuff.
---
1440p @165hz is even better :)
---
I haven’t played on any pirate servers, but did play back in vanilla
---
My guess is (from easiest to hardest) Sulfuras - Ashbringer - Thunderfury - Ateish
---
Sulfuras might not be that attractive to many because of price, few classes using 2h and BRE being as good as it is
---
Ashbringer is also a 2h, so depending on loot rules and faction, it could end up in the hands of new raid members
---
Thunderfury needs two things to drop, and you almost need to be a main tank for quite some time to get it, a role that is hard to get and takes a lot of time and effort, unless your very lucky
---
Ateish might end up as one of the more common ones down the road, but it will take a lot of time to get the status in a guild, to be the one who gets it
---
But again, this is pure guessing
---
And more specifically to crags point you don’t get to naxx without picking up some solid tank offspec gear along the way.  Just slapping on a shield doesn’t really do it justice.
---
Oh okay, so if I wanted to use conflagrate WELL, I would have to find gear that fits that specific build. Overall its just not worth it I guess?
---
Should I switch out my 24' 1080 144hz for a 27 1440 144hz?
---
Running on a 2060 and 1600.
---
TIL - Brexit is its own country.  
---
Thank you random stranger on the internet! /u/1776nREE &lt;3 Reddit is my #1 source of knowledge these days.
---
Of course it's possible. It's a game. It was designed to be played, experienced and learned by yourself. Just play with people who don't try and force you to "know everything" even before you had a chance to play.
---
I've even created a guild for similar purposes. "No rush and no guides". I'm sure you'll find others. ;)
---
Hi, /u/therealpartypooper
---
Game cam, this guys the real deal.
---
Hit the nail on the head, as a word of warning from someone who has tried to make it work, it’s pretty freaking difficult
---
There is not a section for inquiry, but that is a great idea to add to the backlog and see if we can reach out to addon authors.
---
As far as the discord link, I think that is a flaky issue with their system. The link might only work if you are already subscribed to that particular discord.
---
As far as your not being able to log in, I checked the back end and everything seems to be working. It could possibly be a localization issue that I was not prepared for. Are you outside of the US?
---
I don't disagree with that at all, BFA is not a good expansion at all so far outside of the BoD raid. M+ is way less fun than in legion
---
In terms of FPS, wow shouldn't be too GPU demanding, so 4k should run as well as 1080p in that regard. Trouble is you'd be sacrificing refresh rate (aka smoothness), you'd be dumb to take 2160p@60hz over 1440p@144hz.
---
Maybe people play ret like a warrior because there just isnt any spell power + physical dps plate available until you reach T2.. sure there are some rare items like earthslag shoulders in BRD but for the most part you can forget spellpower until T2, unless you want to wear mage gear.
---
Its not like youre going to spam consecration in raid boss fights. It's the easiest and fastest way to get oom in a minute. Basically all you do as ret is judge crusader, seal of command and judge on cooldown. Unless youre fighting undeads and even then the mana cost for exorcism is so high you can't possibly be serious about incorporating it in your rotation...
---
I was in college when WoW came out.  Now I'm old as fuck.
---
Yeah, I didn't mean to sound like I've always been an oracle myself, some of the things were definitely super exciting at the time, like one of the things I regret celebrating now is the removal of hit rating for example. There were things that I was already getting sick of in Wrath though, I've been hoping for things to move back practically ever since, but time and time and again I've had to witness the community's ignorance over seriously concerning developments.
---
I don't think it's just the community's love of conveniences either, but also their refusal to accept things becoming less accessible. I honestly think Cata did a lot of things right at launch, it did a lot of things wrong too of course, but it was the start of going back in the right direction. It never got to fulfill its vision though because the community went absolute mad over it after they had gotten accustomed to Wrath's "everything for everyone" philosophy, so while I don't think Cata was ever going to be amazing, I also think it was set up to fail by Wrath.
---
From my understanding it’s good. Tipsout displayed screenshots of the alpha version in a video on which he showed that you could activate deactivate new graphics
---
This is the exact reason I can't go back to retail. It is just 100% not the same as it used to be.  I've played on private servers a few times and I always go back to them. I have picked up WOW off and on again several times over the years and leveling a character to 60 provides way more fun and enjoyment than leveling in Retail does now.
---
You can sell token for gold which is my main concern.
---
TF was BiS for Tanks until SSC... Can’t see how it could lose.
---
Very good question. I will add some clarification or possibly add a third category. Right now grey indicates not planned or no information. Possibly adding another category specifically for the addons where a mod author has said they will not update it at all. However, I am hesitant to add that knowing that as soon as Classic launches and the excitement builds some of them may change their minds.
---
I gotta say, that is some pretty gnarly skills for video editing for the time and the devotion required to do it
---
Why I want to lvl asap, don't have to deal with some 60 cnt murdering quest NPCs + the FP at xroads while lvling
---
How much of this is due to the reliance on phasing?  Seems like they actively try to have people spread out rather than clustering in one spot, but Classic shouldn't have phasing.  Isn't that why max capacity server size is important?  Surely they are planning for massive TM vs SS wars again right?
---
It could very well be different, since this is not any old game and this is not an expansion
---
Then there's no reason to make it easier for them to do.
---
Let them buy gold, then ban them. And ban the person they  bought it from.
---
When is the last time you've raided mythic in retail?
---
Not sure if you are still reading this but when I was an officer in a guild I had a great guild master who enforced the same rules on himself and on the officers as on everyone else. He fucked up a simple boss mechanic like forgetting to equip Onyxia's Scale Cloak for nefarian, he took the -20 DKP like everyone else.
---
He could have gotten away with saying something like "oh but I was busy trying to raid lead" but he didn't, he played by the same set of rules as the trials and it earned him a lot of respect.
---
Good luck!
---
Suicide, before lvl 10 you don't receive rez sickness so a quick death can save a lot of time walking very early on.
---
I'm floored, these are stunning. The emotion you capture in Burning the Remains of the Dead's face with what looks like very few brush strokes is just incredible. Do you have a website? I'd really like somewhere to go and keep up with what you're doing. Wish I could upvote more than once, because I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed these.
---
I agree, but also playing vanilla back in the day does not equate to playing classic. If anything private servers will be a closer representation of what classic will be like.
---
Fuck, that's a good one
---
min max or don't play
---
Dark souls story in game: "that was a weird fucking boss"
---
Dark souls story on YouTube: "that's the most tragic and compelling character ever written into any story"
---
I said "I would give it to a druid, or anybody who had been dedicated to the guild."
---
That pretty well seems to cover all the classes yes?
---
The person is more relevant than the class imo
---
Blizz specifically said it would be just starting zones for a limited amount of time
---
I’d prefer 144hz and close to 1ms. Mainly playing classic wow and CS go. Also want IPS. Any good screens that aren’t curved or anything like that
---
Haha. Do you main Warlock? And if not, what are you gonna be playing in Classic if you don't mind me asking. Nice name btw.
---
The difference is that in classic, a good player with greens and blues should be able to gank elitists in T1, maybe even T2, and if the matchup is right, mayyyyyybe even T3
---
The strongest wow/music association I have is U2 and tanaris/silithus, I listened to their greatest hits 1990-2000 on repeat while grinding there
---
I haven’t listened in a while and just put it on the other day. I fully plan to listen to it a bunch while leveling and be completely immersed in nostalgia, lol.
---
Agreed.
---
&gt; I also think it was set up to fail by Wrath...
---
IMO the line in the sand that can never be un-crossed was Wrath's *"bring the player, not the class"* design philosophy.  I get why it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it ultimately ended up being the start of homogenization that I could never really forgive.  It undermined the single most important decision many of us ever made  --  which class to play.
---
PvP server. PvP is fun.
---
The bad thing is, sometimes it can't be fun if your being camped.
---
The good thing is it makes an already rich and huge world seems so much darker and dangerous. It's bring the world to life even more for me.
---
Now a days your friend would get destroyed and switch to holy...
---
I'm going to have new parenthood agro in early August, so with each passing day without a release date, full beta announcement, etc. I lose hope that I'll get to experience Classic for another year or two at least.
---
STOP! You violated the law. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit!
---
Great, now Wish You Were Here is stuck in my head. Def gonna have to listen to it on the drive home
---
No, YOU downvoted.
---
You’re welcome ;)
---
One class with one very specific spec.. out of 9. So if you meant this as a negative.. you are wrong.
---
I tried playing on a pserver recently to both "check out what class and professions I want", and to "sate my appetite" to hopefully cool my hype off a little.
---
Instead, it's just made the hype worse and now it's all I think about :(
---
The problem is, when literally every part of the game is bad except solely the encounters themselves, it doesn't matter.
---
The gearing progression system is terrible and has been in a really bad state since MoP.
---
Father-K was pretty dang good at what he did
---
Nah, its a lot more than that. I quit the game because of every possible reason except the challenge of mythic raiding. It was the one thing that kept me as long as it did. 
---
Its the same reason I do stuff like play dark souls - it was really fucking hard, a lot is going on, and you have to practice a lot until you win. 
---
If one of 20 people makes a single mistake at any point, its usually an unrecoverable wipe on a good handful of bosses. Nothing at all like classic, tbc, or wrath. Most wrath hard modes outside of a few ulduar challenge don't even come close to the raid complexity of today. 
---
Swirls are, without a doubt, the least of your problems.
---
He did ok dps though, in one the pug raids I was in he was almost number one. The difference between him and the others at the top was that they only used basic consumables, and he went fully buffed with flask etc. In a pug setting a ret paladin that goes try hard will do ok dps compared to the other non try hard dps.
---
Come check us out.
---
I don't think that's entirely fair, because the WoW community has changed _a lot_ over the years. Anecdotally, among my friends most of the biggest fans of the original vanilla/tbc/wotlk playstyles simply stopped playing over the years. Those that still play the game seem to exclusively have started the past few years.
---
I'm not convinced it's even the same playerbase anymore by a long shot.
---
Nope
---
Im very picky when it comes to FPS games and would not in a million years switch back to anything lower than 120hz, but for slow rpgs in my opinion 60hz is fine.
---
The immersion you get from a 40" 4k outweighs the little bit of smoothness on a very small monitor (and its amazing for watching movies/Tv shows and browsing etc).
---
If you only want one monitor, I would go for something in between like a 27" 1440p 144hz.
---
Because Anger Management lies to you. It generates 1 rage per 3 seconds of combat.
---
From what I've heard from a Russian friend, WoW only became accessible financially to the broader Russian population in Wrath. Basically, before then WoW was much more expensive to play.
---
I don't know how true that is, but it would line up statistically.
---
Doesn't work past the 49 bracket though, items will be in their 1.12 state.
---
I've been trying to find historical data on price records for vanilla wow.  I had some luck looking up a few items on thewaybackmachine on thottbot.  Its the only thing (other than youtube) back then that still has historical posts, but unfortunantly you have to sift through the comment section to find the data.  You also have to do a bit of math. When you find the date you want to pull from it will give how far back the post is from that date.  If you find any good information let me know!
---
Still lots of fun before then :)
---
I didn't mean it as anything. Just pointing out that what you stated isn't unique to classic.
---
Yep, a Lock and a Druid after I get settled with my lock,  and thanks they’re my favorite fruit lol. Thing I find about lock pvp in particular though, no matter what spec you have the things you need. It is a much better class in classic than retail imo, so many options
---
Oooh very nice. That makes it kind of nicer level 20 power spike.
---
This coupled with the fact that there is much fewer GY's in Classic you can really cut down on travel time.
---
However funny this is, though you will infer damage on gear...dont repair. You will replace it all very fast and none of it adds stats generally. 
---
Take off the armor if you plan on using it.
---
You could just buy a screen with a keyboard and mouse. Plug those into the laptop and there you go! Much cheaper than buying a stationary computer also
---
Hardest content in the modern wow is super hard, no shit. but baseline content is super easy. Which makes the game into a grinder hack and slash, rather than an adventure rpg game.
---
When in vanilla baseline content is challenging and adventures. 
---
So ya baseline 95% of the game: vanilla - harder, bfa - easier. 
---
top 5%: bfa - harder, vanilla - easier.
---
Also its not like hack and slash gameplay cant be challenging and complex. d3 high rift can be very challenging. its still a hack and slash session game.
---
&gt;Their biggest issue is mana.
---
And the lack of taunt
---
And the lack of defensive CDs
---
I play on a wotlk server.  My favorite expansion,  so I'm having a lot of fun on it. I know the population will dwindle when classic comes out, and I'll probably drop it for full time classic.  Until then, I'm having fun &amp; scratching the itch.  Doesn't matter if its for nothing.
---
They literally didn't.
---
I actually used to level while listening to the Mega64 podcast. Definitely brightened up lvling with some funny discussion about games/pop culture in the background. Haven’t listen to them in ages but maybe I’ll bring it back

This might have been Blizzards plan all along.  Summer is basically here and we don't even have a release date.
---
It also really limits your population to people who a) have and use Facebook regularly, b) join such groups, and c) are willing to click on random surveys on the internet.
---
I'd say given those three very specific criteria, it's a pretty narrow and biased poll unfortunately. Likely not terribly accurate.
---
Sharding for the first couple weeks in newbie zones to avoid having to over-deploy initial servers then have dead servers and merges after week 1? - not a big deal.  Sharding during the rest of the game?  Huge goddamn mistake.
---
Huge tip. So much wasted time spent walking.  Bags get full? Suicide. Ding an even level? Suicide.  Complete a quest at the back of a cave? Suicide.  Hearthstone has a 60 min CD but suicide is on demand. And even after level 10 I think Rez sickness only lasts a few min at the lower teens and then gets up to 10 min later on. So if you’re level 13 suicide is still a good option for a hearth as long as you plan on spending at least a few minutes in town.
---
Yeah I agree, I'm just debunking the vanilla revisionist in here who claim vanilla combat and raid where complex when in fact raid mechanics were brain-dead easy by today's standards and rotations were even easier (not talking about PvP here)
---
I'm rolling alliance this time, and it makes me sad that even if they do launch with the unarmored epic mounts, I won't be able to get my ivory raptor :(
---
Yep. Trying to just do some work on my alt priest and remember being denied because AotC on my warlock didnt matter since he was dps.
---
Kind of like the 30ft tall raid trash mob that every player was afraid of because it would probably 1 shot them, and their big slow attacks you saw comming.
---
Compared to modern wow where 10 spell effects are flashing around so hard you can barely see where the mods are standing, and use UI mods to highlight key elements and custom sound que's to tell you when the fuck to press the blue button.
---
Aye, I just hope we can all agree that the Blizzard Classic experience is that... the Blizzard experience. 
---
There will still be private servers, some people will never pay for WOW and they are just using excuses now to play on Pservers, and they will find new excuses when classic launches. Not much we can do about it. They wil use sharding (even if its just the starting zones), addons, graphics, pathing (wich will be different i bet with the new engine), "Wrong" stats and tons of other excuses just to avoid having to pay for it.
---
Timeless isle was pretty good. MoP had lots of fun things to do actually. Legion carried some of that over... Then for BFA it was like.. Lol treasures? Nah have some bullshit grind points! It was like they were too lazy to put the fun part into the game this time around. Most likely someone did a focus group and BFA lack of fun hits some metric that supposedly increases some metric they believe generates more money..
---
I don't think it's really a question of phasing though.  You would think phasing is a non-factor in BG's, and yet the in IoC/AV nowadays any time there's a large scale factor it lags like crazy.  I think this has been the case dating back to WoD at least, Ashran would have this issue pretty frequently (though maybe not to the same degree).
---
Haha great idea....will yawn and send the wife to bed early! 😂😂😂👍
---
I mean hell even a good geared 49 can drop a fresh 60 with enough work.
---
But there's 30 seconds of downtime between pulls, and you have to carefully round up the mobs and place your blizzard. You don't just dive head first into a pack of mobs spam your buttons and then move to the next pack with no downtime. Hack n slash is defined by consistently being in combat
---
I do not agree. Although the sample is not large, but it is one of the active cores of the community. They exchange opinions, communicate, post videos, pictures and text posts. This was not a poll, it is an analysis of profiles in this community.
---
Speed levelers love this idea.
---
&gt;Modern WoW "mechanics" are just different color swirly things
---
Look mate, there is a lot WoW does wrong these days, but that's absolutely the furthest thing from the truth and screams a lack of knowledge.
---
Probably won't find IPS with 1ms.

I never understood these ultrawides.
---
Its good for some games and absolutely horrible for basically everything else like watching 99.9% of video content,  browsing, desktop work etc.
---
Why not go for a large 4k and if you really want 21:9 you can just press a button and voila you have one with the same screen size without gimping yourself anywhere else.
---
Yeah this meme had so much potential.
---
Just like wow.
---
Is this intentional? This might be a 8000 iq meme.
---
Now you're shifting things towards something else entirely.
---
Figures, were debating a glormpf supporter
---
True though :^)
---
Gotta pump up those up. Those are rookie numbers.
---
Yeah, this is awesome! Best feeling I had in wow, a get up and cheer moment, was when we first downed Rags. 
---
We’d grinded FR gear as a guild and worked hard to get all we needed, a few weeks of wipes, and then got him down! 😀👍
---
Yeah that’s true but if I recall, that setup usually gives a lot of input lag and would defeat the whole purpose of a battle station.
---
Found a IPS one with 1ms 144hz from ASU’s, but was 1080p.
---
Maybe I should get the 1080p one and don’t care about 1440p, probably doesn’t make
---
Much difference?
---
its actually superior for video content *and* browsing *and* games. either something does not support it, and its the same as a 16:9, or it does support it and it is superior. not difficult to comprehend
---
ASUS PG279Q
---
It's 5ms, but I dont think you can even get IPS screen with lower latency than that.
---
And unless you're really into some fast paced shooters, 5ms should be totally fine
---
You know Nostalrius was free, don't you?

We had a Ret Pally in our raid guild. He was the cousin of some one in a tight knit group that was part of the core of raider-ship. We let him play with us to appease them because they were a group of 8 players and played key roles in our raid. We designated him the OOC rezzer. His job was to stay out of combat and resurrect people who died during the fights. It was especially useful on Geddon because people always died after being the living bomb. Their job was to run to a specific spot in the room and blow up, and then he would go and rez them.
---
What if my fun is farming my Bis list ?
---
If you've got the money then sure, the amount of desktop space you get is really nice, especially if you like to have more than one window open, aliasing in games is much less noticeable and obviously things will just look more sharp in general. The 1440p monitors tend to have deeper blacks and better colour also. I'll warn you though, once you go to 1440p, it's hard to go back to 1080p.
---
you can't get the voodoo if you roll a dwarf
---
It's a powerful talent considering it's a passive, low in the tree, and only consumes one point, but you won't feel it immediately more than likely. At 15 seconds of combat you'll generate 5 extra rage though, which may be the difference between a Heroic Strike or a regular auto.
---
I personally can't not speak for a level 20 spike: I tried following advice online and went 2h Fury, but I hated it an respecced at 39 to arms. Arms does get better the higher up you go, since it facilitates you changing stances (with the one talent let's you retain upto 25 rage upon stance change), meaning you're not punished for maintaining Rend, using Retaliation, etc. But yeah.
---
You just posted asking about a monitor... Please do not spam the sub with reposts.
---
Agreed.  Many of them have even set the ground work stating that they expect the current Pserver meta to be the exact same in live and we know from old parses and videos that Live is going to be different from what they "think" the game will be =/
---
Even just a time stamped youtube link to this scene would be enough, we don't need the labels, we know which is which.
---
Tbf from my experience the WowVanilla site gives untrue information quite often, or only has the infromation from a certain patch not them all. While Wowhead my have taken some assests and information they have managed maintain them and keep the information up to date years later
---
Bad players who want carried by good players hate simming.
---
If you want to play with competitive players, you need to perform at that level. 
---
If you already perform at that level, you have nothing to worry about.
---
To say everybody had to fulfill their role in a way even remotely close to how everybody in a HC raid these days has to, is just flat out wrong. To call vanilla gameplay anything other than "basic" is an overstatement. Don't get me wrong though, I very much prefer vanilla over current wow but in comparison to recent raids vanilla is pretty much tank and spank

Most private servers take advantage of this to make a world channel. Anyone on the server can join and it makes finding groups and selling things 10x easier.

It's like if you're passion is your talent then. Like great for you

Right here. I absolutely love playing from my laptop. I’ve never been a big fan of being chained to a PC, so being able to sit in the kitchen or on the couch with my fiancé and still get in some time where I can is great. It’s powerful enough that I don’t ever really need to worry about how it will handle games(obviously WoW in particular). Even bigger plus, I won’t have to lug an entire gaming rig across the country and worry about finding space for it when I move in a few weeks.
---
very sad
---
Roll Horde, i'll hang out with you!

Probably if they had the but they don’t
---
I like the name, not a super big fan of the fruit. I'm super excited for PvP, that was my favorite part about retail, so I'm sure it'll be fun in classic. I've not played Vanilla other than on pservers but I can't wait to actually have a class identity and actually have a community that works together.
---
The only reason the LK finale was so memorable to me was because of the Ony attunment quest lmao.
---
$15 a month is far less of a barrier than having to pirate a client risking a letter from your ISP, knowing everything you spent months working on will eventually be wiped out by a cease and desist order, and there being zero marketing. The fact that a single private server got 150k regular players means there are many times that in people that would play Classic.

This post seriously is missing words needed to be understandable and has been removed as low effort. Please repost it once you've proofread it a bit.

For resto - 
---
* The mana reduction to healing spells is more useful than faster cast time on Healing Wave in both PvE and PvP. CH is your most used spell in PvE, LHW in PvP. 
---
For Ele -
---
* Reverberation is not as great as it sounds, especially if you don't max it out. Instant Fire Nova is better as it's a great tool to knock Rogues out of stealth right after they Vanish.
---
Those are the big things I see at least, as a non-Shaman player.
---
The big question will be can people clear naxx with only AQ40/BWL gear and a single run worth of naxx drops. Guilds may need a couple of weeks of drops to kill KT.
---
Wtf. Have you played wow since? Are you planning to go balls deep this time around too, or are you taking a more sober approach?
---
Aren't we running on a modern client? Have they announced that the AddOn API will be reverted as well? I could swear that I've read the opposite.
---
I've been trying to scratch the itch by leveling a dude on retail but it feels hollow and pointless. Made it to level 17.
---
It's like trying to practice cooking skills by making easy mac.
---
Last time I heard that was when someone was explaining 60hz to 144hz.
---
You've convinced me.
---
Luckily you can sniff most of it out at this point with some googling, you just have to be aware of what smells like bullshit. Stuff like sit-crit, facestab, and certain item interactions are definitely wonky but at least verifiable through forum threads and and other posts on the subject. I've been playing a private server because I have for a few years now, and recently I started doing basically this in preparation for classic, and trying to find as much stuff as I can like this. Luckily it seems like the aforementioned things are the biggest offenders and besides that it's mostly a few items being better/worse because of proc rates, or quests/xp being wonky. I think probably 90% of the knowledge will carry over pretty seamlessly, even if the mob spawns and cast cycles aren't exactly the same.

You can always count on the art and music team to carry their weight. They truly do excellent work, it’s just the rest of the god damn team that are fumbling around

Loving this. Laptop is like a Druid . Sure it ain’t what people would call “the master pc” , but it makes up for it by being able to take on different forms of playing it in any given situation 😁
---
Almost all internet content goes into the direction of mobile content (slimmer) and so more wasted empty space on a 21:9.
---
You could say then I put more windows side by side, but at such a small screen that gets really meh at some point.
---
Superior for video content where you have black bars on 99.9% of your content, and those black bars even maybe looking grey because you dont have a perfect black VA panel?
---
1 - 20 is a clusterfuck.  
---
  I only know from the perspective of the Alliance(Eastern Kingdoms) so...  Westfall quests require lots and lots of drops for the stew, mobs killed, and such.   Competing against these will be touch.   Dun Morogh troll quests and the quarry can also be a bitch as theres drops required from them and there are kill quests for them as well.  
---
There are also named mobs that you need a drop from that will require you to hope your group gets the first tag on.  This will also help you get to Redridge, wetlands, and Duskwood quests alot faster and stay ahead of the "Redridgeboss" ganking-curve(vernacular from the private server community).   Too, it will help you get established as the goto person for advice from other's playing your class.
---
There are also a decent amount of rare spawns that drop pretty good greens(and in some cases blues) for the level 10-30 range that will be highly sought after esp rogues, warriors, and hunters.   Furthermore, when you get to around 25-30(of which getting through the 1-20's is a prereq)  youll be able to farm the chests that spawn in westfall, elwynn, and the low-mid level areas of RedRidge to sell for silver/gold to get that lvl 40 mount faster.
---
TLDR, its all about getting past the shit-storm that is the low-level zones so you can diversify your options faster and stay ahead of the majority of players.
---
I can’t speak to the current state or responsibilities of raid members in WoW at the moment. I have not played in a number of years. However, being a raid leader 10+ years ago, I took a lot of time explaining each role for everyone.  Did everyone need to be perfect, certainly not, but characterizing it as tank and spank is just not accurate.
---
There were typically 2-4 things you needed to be actively paying attention and reacting to while also fulfilling your role (DPS, Healer, Tank) or you would die and potentially wipe a raid. Not to mention knowing the multiple phases of fights and how to safely transition from one to another.
---
I was cautioning the person I replied to against assuming that this will be representative of the larger player base. 
---
It's interesting data and I appreciate that you took the time to graph it. I think what it *does* show is the approximate age range of the most enthusiastic core.
---
This post is awful. And adding English subtitles over English audio doesn't really work.
---
Go back to your pservers troll.
---
Don't put cheating in quotes. It is cheating, at least be honest with yourself lol.
---
I too will be leaving osrs. But I plan on doing afk mobile stuff while I play wow. Not planning on playing any other games besides classic wow.
---
&gt; Everything is just one big number: item level. 
---
That is the biggest arrow in my quiver every time I bring up what drives modern WoW into the ground. After you play it you realize the importance of that number and how much it overshadows everything else in the game. It determines whether you get into groups, pick an item to use, or even how other players see your skill and experience. Every expansion it's reset.
---
I played 75% of Legion and a month of BFA. The only item I remember because of that is Bloodthirsty Instinct off Ursoc. And that's because it was a trinket and had an effect that I would remember. Item level drives the need to multiple versions of every item, multiple difficulties, and IS the Hamster Wheel. Without it, maybe the game would be tolerable. But who really knows, it seems that without it the community would just make another gear score addon anyway. I really hope that doesn't happen in Classic... :(
---
I like to just pretend they don't exist, cuz it makes my brain hurt that anyone would even consider playing one.
---
&gt;seal of command 
---
It's 2019. Come on people.
---
Seal of Righteousness is the way to go. The seal go off on every melee hit and it acts like a regular swing meaning it can proc "on hit" effects. Effectively solving your mana issues as long as there's Judgement of Wisdom up on the boss.
---
You want to use this with Shadow Oil and Dragonsbreath Chili as they both benefit from spellpower. They also have a flat procrate so the faster your weapon the better. Which is why your top DPS weapons are MCP, Ironfoe, Flurry Axe etc.
---
Exorcism has a 30sec cooldown so I'm not sure why you think its a problem using this. You also always want Consecration active. Downrank it to account for how long the fight will go on, but always have it active. Every tick has a chance to trigger  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=21190](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21190)
---
When Blizzard first made WoW, they intentionally put the most items in the game, but stopped before the point were people stopped caring, BFA is way past the point were people care.
---
I feel you, man.  Renewed my sub for the first time in years, didn't even go one month before I cancelled it.  Got a mage from 1-120, geared, it was so streamlined I could have been asleep and on autopilot.
---
I was 16 when the game released.. so high school.  I usually did my homework during class and never had to study for a test to get good grades so it really wasn't a huge time commitment.  A couple of my buddies in high school played too so WoW was my 'social' activity.  On the weekends we would stay up playing until McDonald's opened and we'd meet there for 'breakfast' before calling it a night.
---
I think I can shed some light on my grinding statement.  Ever since WoTLK I have been a collector of mounts and actually found it enjoyable.  I had over 400 mounts and all that fun stuff it was my way of staying connected to the game while avoiding content that I didn't enjoy; but with the addition to Island Expeditions mounts were near impossible to farm.
---
Seriously during the half-week where IE's were farmable while afking on the boat, I did it for 2 days straight and only got 1 mount.  Normally I would do 1-3 a day and still I only have 1 mount from IE's.
---
Then when the BoD patch hit they added more mounts and more RNG to IE's and it was so disheartening that I refused to farm anymore for mounts which was my #1 thing to do in WoW few weeks later I realized I hadn't logged in.  Used all my gold to max my blizz balance have 10 tokens in my bag to renew my subscription for Classic and still got 2mil left over.
---
Thinking more about it this ridiculous RNG stance they took with WoW is my #1 grip not just the shittier grinds.  Adding RNG ontop of RNG with another layer of RNG is super unfun.
---
Today we have external keyboard and mouse too, it's amazing
---
Yup, you've played quite a bit. To put things into perspective, a full time job with 2 weeks vacation per year is 2000 hours. The hours you've played is almost as much as a full time job in addition to whatever other job you have in the real world.
---
I would 100% stand in line for this on release day. 
---
I miss the days of grabbing snacks with the crew and going to a midnight release together, making plans, and meeting other die hard fans of WOW.
---
yup, i got to 60 on a higher rates vanilla pserver, learned I can basically level a warlock naked and still do good until around lvl 50ish
---
Yes, I plan to keep it unlisted until it is complete, I think an incomplete leveling guide is not that useful, like driving your friend halfway through a desert and then leaving him stranded with no vehicle out of there. :P
---
I think the first raid, with Ghuun I think his name was? 
---
I mean you are right in assuming I haven't raided much in retail. I just know that I felt absolutely nothing, and I was raiding with friends. 
---
Did you raid on Nost or retail vanilla at all? Just curious.
---
I don't think it's harder, aside from actually forming and coordinating a 40 man raid, which is no small feat. But I don't know, it is just a much more "epic" feeling, storming Blackrock Mountain with 40 players.
---
I don't think they'll be available at all. The words "WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12." to me includes the changes they made to the mount-looks early on, meaning the unarmored ones that was left available for a month after the change will not be there.
---
There are obviously some straight upgrades in both games but Apex is similar when it comes to gun attachments. For a scope, you don't always grab an "epic" or "legendary" one because they aren't discretely better.
---
When using something like an R-99, many people prefer the HCOG x1 due to the improve vision when as running a 2-4x AOG on it would be a bad idea especially if you don't have a stock/barrel attachment.
---
Ultimately, I don't think the comparison you've drawn is that great as each game has situations where one thing is just flat out better than another.
---
Fire nova wont be instant after the talents. It will still be 2 seconds before it goes off. Its a good talent otherwise but not against Vanishing rogues
---
I agree with 90% of what you’re saying but if we’re being technical there are many mechanics even in vanilla where 1 person can wipe the raid. Not to say vanilla is mechanically challenging but yea it can happen.
---
For real. I come home from work everyday and I'm just fucking bored. I play FFX on Switch for a little bit and look at WoW videos and that's about the extent of my gaming-related hobbies.
---
woo fellow bdo survivor
---
I said when you "get hit gear **and full talents.**" When do you get full talents? When you're done leveling. You just rephrased what I already said.
---
Are you playing at a level where 4ms would really make a difference?
---
Good perspective, thanks. I am doing 2-H arms I believe. I like the look of a lot of it. Hopefully I'll also be able to slap a sword and board on for tanking 5-mans but most of my time is going to be grinding and questing in open world.
---
Yeah towards the beginning of bfa there were multiple post being like I can remember the day I got perditions blade, But I couldn't tell you any item im wearing in bfa...
---
Dick and ball jokes are the greatest gift to the human race.
---
Different item id's they didn't change the mounts they added new ones
---
Similar to the Blue PvP set, they never changed the old mounts, they removed them from the vendor and added new mounts to purchase.
---
If anything, it would be more in line with their recent announcement of bosses in dungeons only dropping pre 1.10 loot in P1. It would most logically follow that vendors would follow the same pattern.
---
&gt;and we have no reason to believe they will
---
We don't? Are you serious right now?
---
Nice job on the talent calculator! How would implementing it on a website work?
---
But then you wouldn't get to enjoy all the memes here. Id just be living my boring old normal life. Ewww
---
Vanilla was all about the guild for me. If I was playing I was on voicechat, but it wasn't all about voicechat either. People mostly typed in guildchat while doing their own thing, but if you were going to do a dungeon or a pvp group, you got into a vent channel to chat and coordinate.  Even if the group had a PuG or two, we'd talk on vent with eachother and type in group if needed. Sometimes we even invited the PuGGers to join our vent if we felt like it. 
---
Raiding and grouping with people mainly in the guild, our guildmates became like a second family. You would find people you always wanted to group with and you would learn about their life as time went on. We'd cheer for promotions or passing a test. Be happy for someone if they had a date. Be understanding if some one had a bad day. But a lot of it was talking about the game, sharing memes and jokes and random pop culture bullshit. It was an aspect of WoW that made it a lot of fun.
---
I hope Classic can re-create the need for having a close set of "friends"/"guildmates. Its fun being like Norm, where everyone knows your name.
---
Same. 
---
My choice of class being mage has absolutely no influence over that whatsoever though.
---
Not disagreeing at all, but Thaddius is the first mechanic that comes to mind to qualify to the same level of modern wow. Living bomb can wipe a raid, but it impacts one player. Modern wow mythic is full of things that impact all players at once and if any of them mess up its an instant wipe.
---
100% serious. The Classic team have given no indication of it. If they do put it in the game I'll protest with the rest of the people here, but until we have definite proof that it is, AKA I load up Classic on launch and see I can buy WoW tokens with Classic gold, it seems stupid to panic over it.
---
Wow dude, don't get so pissed over something so miniscule. Reactions like yours are part of the reason why there's so much animosity between retail and classic fans. Modern wow is more mechanically demanding than classis, that's a fact. Deal with it. That however doesn't change what is great about classic or the numerous problems retail has, so please get your head out of your ass.
---
I heard that mens balls are different bauce when you walk that they dont smack against each other monkaHmm
---
This is so bad, it's fucking amazing. 100/10. The music sounds like you blasted it on the speakers and recorded it back with a mic.
---
Ah, that's right! I vaguely remember how those changed over night, I was in the process of grinding one out as a paladin early on (didn't want the charger, every other paladin had it damnit!) and when I went to buy the one I had set my eyes out for it was gone. Oh the horror..
---
Ultimately it was ok at the time though, because now I could buy a Ram with glowing eyes!
---
Needs Bartender!
---
Yea, in my opinion 144hz is still the bigger upgrade, but 1440p isn't far behind either.
---
so many collectors editions can be spotted on that picture.
---
Fellow rust player looking to move over to classic on release. It's one or the other, unfortunately.
---
I tried going the laptop route but could never truly enjoy using a 17” display when so used to 27” 1440.  
---
I’m just picky tho prolly.
---
Tbh Uldir was an awful raid lol. BoD is a million times better. 
---
Yeah i raided back in vanilla and TBC. Cleared everything up to Naxx in vanilla and everything up to sunwell in TBC.
---
Yeah I understand your point. I understand people liking slower, more "epic" raids. That's fine with me. All I'm saying is people saying raids in retail are simpler than in vanilla are just lying to themselves and everybody else.
---
Imagine Putin ban the Internet a week before the release of Classic.
---
I think you’re ruining the point with these blatant misconceptions/lies about modern raiding.
---
I always thought that the addon that calculated gear score was the end of WoW as I enjoyed it. Once it was implemented into the game and people started only inviting people to raids based on gear score it was buried and done for me. I played off spec classes and was undergeard for most of the time I played. In pvp I still did really well and crushed bad players with better gear all the time. In pugs I watched bad players with better gear sit in fire or pull aggro and wipe. I get that the game is about numbers and every percentage matters but that cant replace player skill and game awareness.
---
Post naxx release or post naxx cleared by more than 50% of the active players?
---
Audio quality gave me a migraine. Upvoted
---
Now in vanilla, but in BC and Wrath I listened to a lot of Rise Against while leveling. Now whenever they come up on my music playlist I always get little flash backs of flying around Outland and Northend killing giant nordic people and infernals.
---
The best meme. :D
---
so i don’t wanna make a whole new thread for this cause i don’t wanna annoy anyone.. 
---
But will i be able to buy a subscription for classic wow only when it launches? or what’s the deal with that. do i just download the game when it launches and it should give me some steps?
---
Whoops, you're right. Thanks for pointing that out
---
having black bars does not make it inferior, it makes it the same. so, like I said, the content is either the same as a 16:9, or it is superior at 21:9. and the dual browser windows are not small on a 34" ultrawide.
---
Man, even the battlegrounds, really? This game has gone a long way downhill indeed. I'd prefer week long AV rounds over this bullshit any day.
---
yes, misspoke
---
Exactly what I'm looking for, thanks!
---
That is true, and I agree.. Not much one can do it about unfortunately, as you say.
---
 I must say that the dire maul logo was freaking awesome.. loved it! :D
---
You the best guy ❤️
---
I don't know what WoWVanilla is, but the site you linked (Classic DB) steas WoWhead's information. Wowhead however has up to date information for everything since they use official game data.
---
 Nucular. It's pronounced nucular.
---
There are a whole lot of things that 'no one cares' about that NoChangers deeply care about.

---
"First two Weeks" Oh man you have no idea how many people are going to no life it 16 hour days to high levels the first week.
---
Yeah I mean I can't disagree there, vanilla is simplistic in that way. Sorry for being so hostile sounding. I just had a bad experience with BfA when I played. I might try out the newer stuff if my friends start playing again.
---
I mean, gotta have a retail sub anyway.
---
It’s not 8 million WoW accounts, it’s 8 million players across all their games
---
as the other guy said, but fire nova not rogues, its just part of your burst.
---
Corrupted Ashbringer! Cleanse the Undead!
---
Look at all those people holding a box unknowing it would be worth about $5,000 now.
---
Don't think many games had Russian localisation back then. They probably did like most other kids not speaking English or another major language, and learned English so they could play games.
---
He's not wrong no matter how you wanna phrase it.
---
Usually around the second highest rank or global. But I play it in periods. Patches
---
I mean everybody as bad experiences playing BFA, it's an awful expansion. I barely log in outside of raid nights and my one m+ to get loot in the chest. 8.2 looks much better though hopefully.
---
That works for dungeons yes. But It doesn't work for raids typically.
---
Not sure how you can call something stealing when by that logic they stole the information themselves, its the internet. Secondly no other website that does wow classic info is a nearly good as classicdb, nearly every person on a psever will direct you here, as the information is looked after and not forgotten like on wowheads version.
---
After that, we will no have Putin. Thralll our only warchief.
---
The original mounts were not overwritten, they still exist in the game files.
---
But I still agree that in 1.12 they were not available on any vendor and so there's a good chance they won't be in Classic, either.
---
Thanks for the correction, I updated my OP.
---
gotta laugh every time i see a warr doing that strat  
---
ITS SO FUCKING SLOW  
---
then here i am, an idiot(aparently) for dual wielding on my warr, already attacking my 3rd mob while the 2h hamstring guy is just about to finish his first. Doing so w/out the /sit macro crap fwiw.
---
Jason Hayes mostly. Derek Duke came up pretty frequently as well.
---
The white dps decrease is not only around 10%. You miss like 15% more without any hit gear. You also can't kite the mob well so you take more damage while dual wielding.  Sure you HS and overpower less as 2h but your abilities to more damage. You showing some numbers about overpower doesn't really prove anything.  
---
You also have to be fury to DW level and don't have sweeping strikes or any ability to PvP. You also have to keep upgrading two weapons the whole way thru leveling.   
---
Look, you can feel special with your snowflake strategy. But no way it is faster or more efficient than 2h leveling.
---
Yeah Senior in highschool here when vanilla dropped. Old AF
---
As I said, an established guild. It's in the original post.
---
Tokens aren't a catch-up mechanic, it's a mechanic that allows you to get predetermined piece of loot for putting predetermined amount of effort in running dungeons, if the RNG wasn't working in your favor. You could also spend them on some cosmetic shit in case it was. Compare that to shoving loot down your throat to the point when it's not even meaningful to get an upgrade, from, it begins at like level 1 in BFA, right? Epic upgrade and all that bullshit.
---
Shadow banned?
---
One thing you will notice in Classic..gold is much harder to come by.  Flasking is easy on PS because gold is so much easier to get.
---
This. I can accept temporary 1-5 or 1-10 sharding to avoid closing and merging a bunch of dead servers in a few weeks. But it has to go after that.
---
Rammstein / slipknot / Dimmu Borgir / cradle of filth.
---
Sounds about right. I'm 24, and I was old enough to play Classic in 2006 but not old enough to be any good at it. Hopefully this time it won't take so long for me to level &gt;_&gt;
---
Uhh, bags dropped all the time on Nostalrius. What the fuck is going on?
---
Who the hell holds a duel tournament at the burning steppes ramp to brm? lol
---
Do they know which addons will work at launch?
---
Man I'm sort of in the same boat as you and have had the exact thought about getting a laptop JUST for WoW. The only way we'll get to play is if we're on a laptop in the same room as significant other, because the gaming rig is upstairs etc. Not near the "Netflix tv". 100% you gotta get that portable game going
---
I worked with Derrick Acosta at a papajohns in Del Mar when he was filming the first season of mega64, super cool dude.
---
Can someone explain why servers can't handle this in 2019?
---
I don't think literally can be properly used in this way. To literally do something, means to actually do it in the literal sense. You can't have the converse (as in you literally did not do something). Makes no sense. Literally.
---
Currently only playing retail. Once Vanilla comes out I will essentially stop playing retail. I hope classic lets the devs see what we want as a community and use the success from classic and bring back everything we want.
---
Absolutely do not do LC as your first guild. If you are not in a cutting edge world competitive raid guild, where you are trying to set world records or get server firsts, LC just creates drama. It sounds good on paper, but people will end up falling between the cracks, and that means that they will get pissed and start drama, or leave.
---
DKP is a lot of work, and still has a lot of problems. If you're looking any guild that isn't straight hardcore, modified suicide kings, bid-all DKP, EPGP, and gold bid are all better solutions IMO. Gold bid works best if you're mostly doing PUGs or PUGing out content on farm, but it's fair and no one will feel like they got *nothing*. Personally I'm a big fan of suicide kings.
---
The guild I'm currently in uses loot list, which I haven't used enough to have an opinion on whether or not I like it yet.
---
Your subscription to retail includes access to Classic.
---
Not sure if that's what you were asking.
---
There's 5 stages of every prerelease subreddit. 
---
1. Excitement. 
---
2. Hype.
---
3. Overhype.
---
4. Paranoia.
---
5. Cynicism/Rejection.
---
This sub is now in number 4.
---
Well what I remember was multiple people fuck up the most simple tasks such as "innervate player X" or stop "stop DPS now" numerous times, without having major impact on the overall raid. 
---
Note that I didn't say it was literally tank and spank (even though it was in quite a few instances) but in comparison to any recent version of the game. People still have to pay attention to all the things they had in classic (minus aggro) plus a dozen more things like an actual rotation, numerous we effects etc.
---
I'm gonna give you though that being a raid leader back then was probably as stressful of a job as it is now...if not more so because people were so bad back then and literally needed every last detail explained only to still fuck it up. So I get where you are coming from.
---
But classes, boss mechanics and overall are extremely basic in vanilla when compared to now. Doesn't change the fact that raiding in vanilla can be really awesome and has a lot of things going for it
---
I didn't have log on problems
---
\#ftfy Playing on a Classic Server does not equate to playing World of Warcraft Vanilla.
---
Yep and there will be better premades shitting on horde pugs! Faster queues too :)
---
Has any information on sharding been released?? Did I miss something
---
For sure that’s the best part about it!  I’m not really trashing nightelves at all.  But if we are speaking of min/maxing or optimization of any kind you aren’t really going to find it with nightelf anything.
---
With that said, they have some of the funnest setups with shdowmeld that can arguably win you some very situational fights.   Nightelf hunters holding ab flags for example is very strong, but once you are actually *fighting* someone, it’s stronger to be a dwarf because dwarves counted a LOT of things with their one racial.
---
nice dule turny
---
you see that door marked pirate? you think a pirate lives in there?
---
Cinematics and ''events'' is the most overrated kind of storytelling in games. Vanilla WoW was by faaar the highpoint of storytelling in WoW and all of blizzard, change my mind.
---
People need to remember it’s going to be difficult to even have 40 people show up for a raid. Majority of guilds are going to take what they can get unless you’re in a hardcore guild.
---
So there the dude blazed right through the first 12 levels of mythic due to either being carried or out gearing those levels?  
---
Damn WoW really did turn into Diablo 3 content, that is nearly THE experience of running greater rifts.  Nothing wrong with running higher and higher mythic+/grits, but to say the harder ones are worth while is a stretch for most people.
---
It isnt new or different content. I could try playing the mythic run with my feet to increase difficulty, but it is the same content, again.  Nothing unique in the encounter or the loot.
---
If you enjoy it then more power to ya but it isnt hard, it is gear hated. Gotta grind that gear just like diablo 3.
---
I honestly believe that even if you judge it by itself as a modern MMO its actually a horrible game.
---
I think if you put a little thought into it you could figure out that one meaning applies and one doesn't work at all.
---
What do the 5 fingers say to the face?
---
KAPOOW
---
yes it is, so if i don’t have a subscription to retail, i should get one to play classic?
---
We don't know for sure yet so anyone giving you an answer to this is only speculating.
---
I wish they would release a physical edition again...
---
Hence why I said or elwynn forest... I don’t think there’s going to be people raiding Northshire to often in the first two weeks of classic. Thats the point.
---
I will level as a warlock. Start mining and then go tailoring for my bloodline set + engineering.
---
Scenario 1 (no gold) : 
---
If I do my regular leveling route, I can aim for my lvl60 at around 8 /played days (even on a crowded server) and have around 400gold.
---
Scenario 2 (make it rain baby) :
---
I won't rush it to level max. At lvl 52 (~5.5days), I will heavily grind felwood satyrs until lvl60 while re-specing into SoulLink to disrupt any form of pvp encounter. That way, I might get lvl60 in 10 days total. With this method, I'm going to have quite a lot of felcloth that I intend to sell a bit later for a huge amount of gold. A tailor with 100hours of felcloth farming while getting a decent amount of xp.
---
What do you guys think of my plan? Does it sound   worth it?
---
While ganking may get frustrating to the Gankee, I have absolutely zero sympathy to people who complain about ganking on a PvP server. If you don't want to run the risk of getting ganked, play on a non-PvP server.
---
**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore     
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community.  Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.     
---
**Who are we?**  
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006, and our leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.    
---
**Who are we looking for?**   
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40 man roster. **Our current highest needs are for Holy Priests, Fury Warriors, Rogues, Mages, and Resto Shamans.** We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. Prior boss knowledge and research is preferred but not required if you're playing at the appropriate level. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.     
---
**What will we be doing?**   
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use an all-or-nothing DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional weekend day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We will offer spots to all specs so long as the dedication to play is there, though non-meta specs will be highly competitive. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process.  Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

&gt; Not sure how you can call something stealing when by that logic they stole the information themselves, its the internet.
---
No I mean literally the guides, the comment section, the formatting, every piece of classicdb was stolen from Wowhead.
---
Wowhead created those guides with their own guide writers, the comment section is from uses who posted directly on Wowhead's item pages, the formatting of the site was created by Wowhead.
---
If you think Classicdb is good, it's because Wowhead is good. Not sure how I can make that more clear. Everything on Wowhead is original content. Everything on Classicdb is stolen from Wowhead.
---
Go take a look around Wowhead's Classic site and tell me what you see. Except Wowhead has *more stuff* than Classicdb has.
---
As for the Russian localization of the 00s, there were pirate translation companies in Russia. And there were many pirated games. LOTS OF. Of course, this did not apply to online games. This is just a word. For the rest yes, for some it was a reason to learn English.
---
Oh I loved standing out with my brother at our local gamestop hours before release. People all dressed up in what we called costumes at the time (Guess it would be considered cosplay now) Ahh simpler times my friends.
---
How was the ivory one obtained again ?
---
I agree with you 100% here. We loved it then and now hate it all.
---
Also most of the face-roll features in the game now were inspired by add-ons we ourselves were installing and using.
---
Horde best min/max race is troll in pvp and pve, shadow and holy. UD is over-rated and the math proves it. At the end of the day play what you want, it doesnt matter
---
I dont think Naxx will ever be cleared by 50% of active. It's just a time commitment thing. I would say the equivalent of "next phase" timing, whatever that happens to end up being.
---
More incorrect stuff, classicdb updates and fixes all the incorrect info. Not sure else how I can say it may be taken but if it’s wrong they actually fix it. I’d rather look at corrected and curated information then the faulty stuff, stealing guides w/o links is a bit upsetting to me though.
---
I would say the AP neck grind only exists in the top 10 world guilds.
---
I’ve been in top 100 guilds as F&amp;F as a lot of my friends like to raid but I don’t like committing to a schedule. Many of them do not care, and only care how you perform % wise for your iLvL. As long as you’re doing a single M+ each week and your neck is high enough to have the main DPS traits unlocked it’s typically not a thing.
---
Go play on a private server for a couple hours to "practice leveling"... At least that's what I told myself I was doing, and then ended up with several level 40's and a 60.
---
But for real, just go figure out whether or not you still like it. Personally, I've been having a blast, and my biggest complaints are: 1) everything will go away once classic drops, so it's pointless to keep leveling or actually start gearing 2) Server is dead because everyone's just waiting for classic 3) Shitty Pserver uses microtransactions for bags/mounts 4) Half the server speaks russian/portuguese; and all 4 of those will obviously not be problems when classic comes out.
---
Also as hype as I am, it hasn't stopped be from enjoying other games; I recently got into FTL and have been playing some slay the spire and darkest dungeon. But MMOs? Yeah those are probably ruined for me.
---
The events of Vanilla WoW happen immediately after WC3, and are during a time of truce between Horde and Alliance. Thrall had just allowed Jaina and the rest of the human forces to return home after the battle at Theramore. Horde just wanted to be left alone and Alliance had their hands full after being decimated by the scourge, the fall of their capital, the absence of their king, and the rise of the defias.
---
Multiple aoes hitting multiple targets with modifiers, tracking proccs, cooldowns and ticks certainly affects network lag - spells and thier effects are seriously more complex in BFA - especially with azerite gear across all those 80 players having effects like "when surrounded by 3 or more enemies gain X".
---
Position information, how often data is sent back, and the amount of data sent has increased massively in 14 years.
---
That said the servers act like hot garbage sometime and they should be able to handle more - blizzard should address it but it's not as simple as some make out.
---
A lot of people don’t want to play raids that have more than a handful of mechanics total. A lot of people want to be able to go afk and win.
---
Classic announcement got me to play on PServers to go figure out what I want to play, remember my questing routine, see what Professions I enjoyed or want to deal with..
---
Currently a lvl32  NE Druid leveling in Desolace and remembering how much I dislike going back to other zones to Herb because I wasn't wanting to go out of my way, and now I can't progress.. or the fact that weapon upgrades lack any excitement because I can't even see them.. I do have absolutely 0 downtime, can murder people 1v1 and pair extremely well with my Rogue buddy.. but as much as I have faith Druids can be good, I may not play one after this. I'm  lvl 30 with Redridge gear bacause Orc Crusher and the Smith's Trousers are better than anything I've seen in... 16 levels?
---
I'm buying 300 Redbull's so I can OD and go into the ER again.
---
I blame the state of the game solely on the Diablo 3 developers they brought over to the game in WoD. You can really notice their influence in Legion and more so in BFA. The amount of boring AARPG systems brought over to the game has turned WoW into a Diablo 3 clone with tab targeting. 
---
P.s. I always wondered how many people actually like M+ (greater rifts)? This idea of just endless scaling to me just makes for a very boring game.
---
To be honest, WC3 killed a lot of the RTS elements for me. WC2 was the peak for me. Sending in unnamed units, more of them.. zug zug.. work work.. more wood..
---
When WoW came out, I was pissed, I knew there will never be a WC4 ..
---
Then, later, I tried WoW. Still here..
---
Because it's cheaper to run a bunch of shitty servers parallel to each other than it is to run one big server that can support a lot of people. It's simply a cost cutting mechanism and it's bullshit.
---
&gt; This is not MMORPG. 
---
Technically, retail WoW still is a MMORPG. We might not feel like it's the best, but it straight up is still considered a MMORPG.
---
I get it; We all don't like retail, but lets be real and not make shit up, just to we can shit on it even harder.
---
They have better tools available, but they're not using them well. The writing's bad, and the more dramatic they try to be the more it shows.
---
I think there's a difference between being concerned with getting that 1% extra out of your DPS, and expecting everyone else to get the 1% out of theirs
---
I got one of the black Friday deals on a gaming laptop and that's all I game on now.  Everything runs fine on my 1050 series graphics card.  I'll hang out on the couch with the kids most of the time when I play. Then I have my monitor, wired keyboard, and wired mouse to decrease lag on those when I'm at my desk. And with the laptop if I'm out in a place without wifi I can pop on my mobile hotspot and game from there (yes I know it's a rare circumstance for most, but fits my personal situation great).
---
Hi Andrew, thanks for sharing. Let's be addicts together for the relaunch!
---
We don't know what syntax classic will use yet.
---
When Blizzard were doing games with passion and sharing it with their community.
---
There is no difference between gearscore and the spreadsheets that hardcore raiders back in vanilla would use to determine what items would provide the best upgrade. Those same spreadsheets would summarize everything into a single number as well: estimated DPS/HPS. Gearscore is not something new that Blizzard created to dumb down the game; it's a tool that hardcore raiders used that Blizzard deemed useful enough to implement into the game in an easy-to-use format so everyone could use it. 
---
The only thing that gearscore did was improve the gearing decisions of the average player. It didn't lower the skill cap of the game because it didn't limit your choices. Top tier players were still free to use their spreadsheets and tweak their gear to better achieve whatever objective they wanted to.
---
Saying gearscore somehow ruined the game is like saying the calculator ruined math.
---
I won't get into the "streamer who never played vanilla" thing too much except to say I agree with another comment that you don't have to have played vanilla to be able to gather and share useful information about it. I don't watch video game streamers at all so I can't say much more about these guys beyond that. Being a pserver-baby doesn't necessarily make somebody wholly unqualified to talk about vanilla.
---
I played vanilla, starting in early 2005. Before the official announcement when we all thought Blizz would probably never make legacy servers, I was really jonesing for some vanilla wow. I rolled on a popular pserver and leveled a hunter and a shaman to \~30 each. If nobody had told me pservers were not accurate I probably never would have known. It felt like vanilla, it scratched that vanilla itch. I appreciate that a lot of the "this might be wrong" guesswork effects end-game more than leveling, though, and I think we all need to take it with a grain of salt until Classic releases and we experience the content with correct armor, resists, and tuning.
---
Until then, even the demo showed us our faulty memories, so before we jump on somebody for "being wrong" about vanilla, let's remember that warlock demons DID dismiss when you attempted to summon or enslave another and that summoning disorentation was a TBC change, and maybe our memories that say otherwise are imperfect.
---
WoW OST. Nothing more needed.
---
Being a tailor for WOW classic's launch will make you a very very rich fella
---
Is the syntax an engine based thing?
---
Preach! Legion was pretty cool just because of the lgendary system. You actually had to play a lot and over the course of months to get your legionaries. They had cool names and effects. There was still tier gear too. Now everything is generic and bland. It has just been getting slowly worse since TBC tbh.
---
What's that?
---
This is correct. I just did Vaelastraz for the first time yesterday and half our guild was Russian. Holy shit was the fight hard to get everyone to do what they were supposed to. But it was an amazing feeling when we finally got the kill. I haven't felt that sense of accomplishment in retail in a very long time.
---
If you want to play classic, yes
---
Specifical bind the pet attack and follow buttons to something you can use quickly. If you are using pvp pets, have their special abilities turned off auto cast and bind those too. I used ctrl 1-4 I think
---
Yep, me too. I was playing on a popular pserver, leveled two hordies to about 30 each, then the official announcement dropped.
---
Haven't logged in since, I'm waiting impatiently and checking the official forum blue tracker for updates daily lol
---
Correct.
---
Subscription gives you access to both retail and classic.
---
Does not work for me :(
---
I sent you some links and edited my comment. Go back and read what I linked and let me know what you think. It's irrefutable evidence.
---
So if you switch to my resolution and have much less screen estate and worse black bars its the same,
---
but if I switch to your resolution with better black bars and the same real estate its worse , got it
---
Doesn’t make any sense to me but okay.
---
thank you guys! this community already seems great and i’m excited to get into wow with all of you
---
Some people don't mind rerolling over and over and over again, so for them it's not for nothing.

&gt; limited by tech in 2004
---
Kubernetes, Google' s container orchestration platform (shards are probably just containers under the hood), is about 15 years old. That means in 2004 it was getting started. We didnt have the same tech then, and container/cloud services have the overhead of network comms (which will ALWAYS be slower than inter-process communication on the same machine).
---
TLDR: new tech requires new solutions for achieving the same thing as a different tech stack. Just because it worked in 2004 doesnt mean it works in 2019 on a new stack.
---
Yep I would agree. I'd say it extends probably a bit higher than top 10. Most guilds that push CE or realm first/realm top 10 want to set a "tryhard" attitude and one of the easiest ways to do that is to say, "put in the hours to grind your neck if you want to come to raid".
---
But for guilds who are content with AotC and "lets see how far we can get in Mythic", neck level really doesn't matter.
---
Not necessarily. We just moved from 7 nodes for our Vertica cluster, to 1. Much cheaper.
---
When they uploaded the beta to the CDN (a week or so ago?) it had current graphics options and an additional button that said "classic", which gave you the same graphics that classic had. It also has that in the BlizzCon demo I believe. So yup. There's no reason they shouldn't either considering it only affects the person choosing the option, whether they want the original graphics or "remastered" I guess you could say.
---
Despite the fact that the hypothetical conspiratorial jewish cabal would have far better things to do than undermining a 15 year old game, it doesn't even make sense in this context... Isn't Ion Greek or something?
---
Looks like you have a bit of a typo.  Under you filter list, below "Filter by Planned" is "Everthing".  Looks like you missed the "y" in "Everything"? 
---
Thank you for taking the time to create this for us.  I know I have been looking around for addon plans.
---
Sunder should break CC for sure. It's a hit. I played MT in raids up through Sunwell and this was never a thing for me and in theory sounds like a recipe for premature break on CC. Wouldn't it try to run sunder every time you mouse over a char/NPC?
---

Okay

Drop rates for bags were greatly increased.

Priest specced into improved shadow word: pain.
---
It’s another dot, and they can heal!
---
Generally speaking you have the following options as a warlock:
---
.) Conflag build: pvp glasscanon spec using either succubus or felhunter. You burst down ppl kinda similar to your warlock description, but very low mobility. Its not optimal for pve because you are missing on 10-15% dps compares to the pve specs (in pve you only spam shadowbolt, so no fire spells)
---
.) Soullink (either with nightfall or shadowburn): spell caster tank to outlive enemies in pvp with high dmg reduction. Not optimal for pve, you are missing nice destro talents which equal to minus 5-10% dps compared to pve specs
---
.) Ds/ruin: pve spec with highest dps output on single target with shadow bolt spamming. Not optimal for pvp because you are missing either a pet and/or dmg and survivability talents.
---
.) Sm/ruin: middle ground between pve and pvp. Usually minus 3-5% in dps compared to dsruin. In pvp you are quite the killing machine until melees start jumping on you. You always have a pet and have nice, bursty damage but you fragile.
---
Google the specs and join the classic warlock discord for more in depth stuff:)

 &lt;Get of Fenris&gt; - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
**What’s it mean?**:
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.  
---
**Our Philosophy**:
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.  
---
**So what about loot and stuff?**:
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart**:
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such ***we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).*** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History**:
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times**:
---
TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)
---
**Guild Priorities**:
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/YxwcmTT](https://discord.gg/YxwcmTT)
---
Website: [http://gofguild.azurewebsites.net/](http://gofguild.azurewebsites.net/)
---
Drop us a line under and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
Can you explain what you meant? I don’t follow the logic of “my vacation was approved so tomorrow blizzard will give a release date”
---
I’m sorry I care very little about the comment system and guides. Really just there for quick correct information, if it really is just a copy and paste of info idk how I’ve been lead astray so many times from wowhead and not the other. I also find classicdb to be more user friendly and concise, the things I care about when I just need to alt tab for 10-30 sec
---
Well, even then is way better than WotF
---
wow movie songs :)
---
M+ is a garbage system that better suited for the genre it was born out of. 
---
5 man dungeons were never the main focus of WoW's endgame and nor should they be either. 5 mans were a just a stepping stone in your gear progression to get to the real end game were WoW really shines, which is raiding. 
---
I've run plenty of high keys to realize I hate this system. I do agree the dungeons on higher keys are tough, but it just doesn't feel like a MMO just running the same content over and over without any form of progression other than getting to the next higher key. 
---
I personally think it was a lazy approach to keeping dungeons relevant and it reeks of e-sports. Their obsession with making WoW PVE into an e-sport is what is really killing this game. 
---
They needed to face facts that MMOs don't really have a lot of interest from Twitch viewers and trying to mold the game around this has killed the soul of the game.
---
(In the WoW Classic panel, Ion Hazzikostas mentioned sharding might happen at launch to prevent overcrowding, but suggested it wouldn’t be an everyday occurrence.)
---
So I guess they didnt because  "might" but also "wouldnt" is a definitive. So no, there doesnt seem like there will be sharding beyond a limited/reasonable starting zone approach. Seriously 600+ trolls/orcs killing mottled boars is not a realistic scenario. 80 people running around the Barrens is fine.
---
Yes but to sell tokens for gold you need people with enough gold to buy it. Very easy on retail, on classic not so much IMO.
---
Because op was planning to use vacation time to play classic, but now that he or she has made other plans, the release date will drop and OP will be stuck with a vacation they'd rather not take now.
---
Well it’s not much of a deal even in CE guilds but yeah, those pushing WoWprogress ranks definitely
---
&gt; AQ
---
&gt; I feel an absence every moment I'm not working
---
I have it the other way around. MY abscence is felt when I'm working.
---
Ahhhhh okay, thanks!
---
Would it be possible to change the mobile interface to a “swipe” for removing talents instead of press-and-hold?
---
I hope they make boxes for Classic WoW (probably not) . Would be really amazing to experience those times again!
---
Speedrunners have came out and said most private servers increased drop rates of bags, greens, etc.
---
I've experienced Hunter on both Horde &amp; Alliance. For PvE I'd say its up in the air and take your preferred faction, for PvP go Horde.  
---
Shamans, especially Elemental Shamans, can kill you. With your bow + pet you deal a lot of attacks and this is bad against Eye of the Storm that gives Shaman interrupt free casting if you ever crit them. With Lightning Shield up you take significant damage over time even if they heal. Shamans can cure poison from both a totem and a spell cheaply and if you trade viper sting with their cure poison then you'll go oom much faster than they do.  
---
Paladins are arguably the freest kill a Hunter can encounter. While they are also tanky they completely lack any sort of dangerous spells or abilities from range. Viper sting shuts them down completely as they can't remove poison and their mobility is so low you'll feel bad about picking them apart from range.  
---
Overall both Shamans and Paladins are tanky but Shamans will fire back hard from range while Paladins don't. Their damage output isn't high enough either when they do get in and you have enough tricks to disengage and start kiting again.
---
True, my concern with that combo is if we would be competing for gear?
---
Eventually there is some remove poison thing that's off global
---
Makes stoneskin not nearly as gud
---
i'm the opposite. i didn't care about pservers until classic was announced. now im using my time to practice and refine my leveling.  
---
i dont/wont use quest mods(who knows it they'll even work) n such so im memorizing it all again. Chance my buddies might want to go different faction this time so i'm going to have to work through that a few times also.
---
Ik you're joking but on the last one, back in vanilla my guild often got into huge wars against alliance guilds in the surrounding areas of raids
---
This is the best version for mobile phone compatibility I’ve seen yet - well done!
---
Yes, you would both want the same gear. If that is a concern, not a good idea.
---
Yeah because running the same raid over and over again is different.
---
Things like that are why I'm not opposed to the discussion of  "Class balance", but those concepts need to be very highly discussed and reserved for potential "vanilla +".
---
But its a hot button topic, and the most conservative approach for the time being is just leave it as it is.  You can't "ruin" the baseline of vanilla by implementing no major revamps, and should be reserved by necessity; not want. I would love to make an enhance shaman that isn't garbage for PvP or PvE, much like many paladin players would love to be prot spec outside of reck bombs.  But such new mechanics, talent trees, or even gearing would have tons of unintended consequences that are hard to predict.
---
It all depends on what you can get. Daggers might win out during phase 1 with perditions blade and core hound tooth, with swords taking the lead later on as there as more options. 
---
As has been stated there will be a lot of competition for swords and during the first phase there won’t be any noticeable difference in dps. 
---
However for PvP, I’d always recommend daggers. PvP is all about burst damage and high crits, falling pretty well in dagger land.
---
Red Hot chili Peppers is vanilla for me. I was like 10 when I started classic, and I found RHCP that summer.. Goda, I was so strong back then.
---
You won't have to buy anything, a sub is enough to play both classic and retail.
---
Even on retail you don't have to buy anything anymore, just a sub, unless you want to play the latest xpac, that you have to buy.
---
Classes were a lot more clunkier then though. Also, itemization was funky too, so a lot of times this made those easy encounters more difficult.
---
I also think having just 1 mode of average difficulty is what made Vanilla WoW so successful because everyone played together. There wasn't this segregation of skill level like there is today and the entry level content required way more skill and knowledge of your class than retail requires today. 
---
I think people just miss the social aspects and the competition that was present on our old servers. This is what I think is mainly missing from the modern game. Sure, there are players that adore the lobby style game that retail has become, but I think the social MMO player out numbers these anti social players by a good bit. 
---
It is really hard now in retail to find any kind of community. You have to work really hard to find the good guilds and the friendly and competent players.
---
I hit 5 in less about 35min on the 3 fresh servers I've played and you have actual gear and money from that.
---
Well on one hand it would fucking suck for dungeons because we would roll on the same shit. But, on the other hand it would help us with quests because we would want the same ones for rewards and only one of us would have to pick up tailoring. Thoughts?
---
**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, there is still room to poke fun. And, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Update:** We are growing! I have multiple pledges from current guild members on V.G. There are also 10 or so members in the discord. Feel free to P.M. me with any questions! **Come join us!**
---
Yes
---
Private servers have changed a lot of things, but most people don't know that and are going to flip their shit because Classic "changed" too much.
---
Ironically.
---
Exactly - suggesting they will make an effort to have it as starting zones and temporary is not in the same conceptual universe as **stating** it is starting zones and temporary.
---
Do you know what weapon always pops in my mind when I think of Classic epics? Azuresong Mageblade. People drool and cheer whenever it drops, it’s amazing how people react to items in classic compared to retail.
---
Im old balls
---
Because there's something novel about updating the visuals in an old game. If you mod your Elder Scrolls, Kotor, Final Fantasy games, etc to use better graphics, then you probably get the desire to do it here as well. If you don't, then I mean I guess you don't.
---
People like to mod and update graphics for a number of reasons. It doesn't mean they don't enjoy the base game and can't play it. I just played TES Oblivion on console, potato heads and soupy textures and all, and my PC copy is modded with HD textures, high poly mesh replacers, weather improvements, a flora overhaul that turns Cyrodiil into a jungle, enb, etc. Still plays like Oblivion because I don't use gameplay mods, but it looks pretty sweet lol.
---
Sunder deals no damage, just reduces armor and increased threat. I distinctly remember sundering sheeped and sapped targets with macros that do not activate my auto attack to gain threat before breaking cc.
---
Hunter, the 2 fastest lvling class
---
Yes, I'll get a laptop as well to be more mobile for classic (similar purposes). Prob something in the 1k EUR range.
---
Yeah I get what you're saying. I don't normally fuel the animosity but I was in a bad mood. You're right though, no need to hate and make people think we're all hateful.
---
At the same time you're being hostile towards me so I do hope you see the hypocrisy in your actions as well, fuck face.
---
I just got my TBC and Wrath boxes signed by Kil'Jaeden and Arthas/Garrosh's voice actors, and I've never been more disappointed to not have physical copies of all the expansions.
---
In the context of the post it is wrong though. The discussion is about whether the current game is dumbed down into a hack and slash AOE fest - which it pretty is. Using one spec (which is highly specialized and skilled) to undermine this is not a good argument.
---
Alliance is by far the superior faction in group combat
---
The only advantage is AB and map imbalances in AV (although not sure on that pserver AV very different than one we will get)....and duels
---
Large zerg combat alliance dominates because of paladins (blessing of freedom for wars, bubble, blessing of protection for your mages) and light of elune (invuln item from quest)
---
At lower skill level Shamans can RAPE. But as skill goes up and trash buffs go up the advantages of Shamans get reduced not magnified. Just spamming buffs on yourself counters purge (you can get 32 visible in vanilla, maybe more in the client idk). And people will kill/react to your totems. 
---
While a paladin has almost no counter play being kick/counterspell and some of the most unique spells in the game.
---
&gt;That's fine with me. All I'm saying is people saying raids in retail are simpler than in vanilla are just lying to themselves and everybody else.
---
Did you run the LFR MC event  during WoD I think it was? Those easy mechanics gave a lot of those groups of hell of a lot of problems. 
---
I think you are not taking into the account that a lot of people that never played Vanilla are going to try Classic and like it. A lot of these players will be casual players and I think they are going to have trouble with some of these fights. This even might be their first foray into actual guild raiding since retail just lets you AFK raid now. 
---
While I do agree the mechanics are very simple for a veteran player like us, I think a lot of players will find the fights can be tough. 
---
Just my experience on Nost, I ran a lot of dungeons and there were a lot of players that had trouble with those simple mechanics.
---
This is a pretty bad take on what happened. Blizzard starting hard designing item stats around gear score so the players started using it as a metric. In classic and tbc this wasn’t a thing because Ilvl was completely arbitrary.
---
Lots of mature people left VK when arrests for reposts and comments started.
---
I believe all those people who played Vanilla at age 20-30 are not in your group.
---
Speed isn't really our priority here. These would just be alts to play exclusively together. We're trying to find a combo to enjoy levelling the most.
---
Retail is a really good hack n slash game with a *terrible* rewards system, which to me severely diminishes the enjoyment. In a game that is so blatantly about the loot treadmill, having loot that is so random, so bland, and so disposable kind of defeats the entire purpose of the game imo.
---
Shadow priest and hunter will work well.
---
Shadow damage or two ranged pet classes.
---
Play any healing class and itll be great.  He can tap relentlessly and you can choose druid, shaman, paladin to not have to roll on the same gear
---
Yea but paladin &gt; shaman outside AB
---
And because of that alliance &gt; horde outside duels
---
If Classic came with in-built graphics toggle it would not let you select your WSG flag and make it huge, sparkly, Onyxia-shaped, etc. It would still be a WSG flag.
---
Same with terrain.
---
Casting animations is a good point, though, assuming new player models are given more varying animations instead of the same number of unique animations as the old models. So you would probably still be able to fake-cast your hearthstone to waste somebody's CD.
---
80/90's alt rock + metal.
---
Gamecam, 5fps, ultra-tinny audio played back at max volume, horrible spelling.
---
10/10.  Authentic as fuck.
---
Yes but the amount of particles a spell has, has 0 effect on the network. All of what you describe has effect on network
---
Because Wowhead has three websites for different versions of the game. There's a list with checkboxes at the top of the site:
---
PTR
---
Live
---
Classic
---
If you're looking for Classic info, make sure your URL says classic.wowhead.com, not www.wowhead.com.
---
Thank you for taking one for the team OP. I appreciate you. I may let you live in our inevitable encounter.
---
It will be interesting times, seeing the reactions when faced with the true mcoy(or about as close as can be).
---
It's also a good combo, the 2 pets ensure minimal amount of deaths
---
&gt; For single target it doesn't really matter. The guilds that go for super TPS will use a Druid in the case of high TPS requirements for single target either way.
---
Druid higher TPS than a Fury/Prot Warrior? I’d like to see the math for that.
---
\#nochangesbutstillchanges!
---
be gnome unless u cant stand being short
---
just a lot of frostbolting in the beginning....That int may be the difference between u getting the first good caster item or not.
---
I wonder what most of these people are up to now? Do you think some of them are waiting for the classic release?
---
Were these on day one? Was there dynamic spawns? Were you fighting for spawns? 
---
Curious, for science, you know?
---
Aspect of the pack will help the lock with mobility until 40 as well
---
I installed Diablo 3 a few days ago and lvled a character to 70 than quit. I had forgotten how boring and unpersonal the experience felt.
---
Getting levels here and there, upgrading weapons like every 10 minutes, do that until you reach lvl 70 than the paragon grind starts.
---
When I read your BFA experience I immediately thought of my D3 experience.
---
Paladins &gt; racials
---
You tell her to meet you in Paris. But you don't go there. Instead you go to Berlin. It's where you hid the chandelier.
---
Blizzard still has passion, unfortunately its only the passion to make as much money as possible.
---
The pserver community is trash, none of them have any idea what they’re talking about.
---
It also has a cool periodic raven animation, and since variable animations like that were not really a thing in classic, made it pretty unique. Not flashy, but definitely cool. Also the raven animation could proc "on cast" trinkets.
---
Yeah. I mean there are pros/cons to the way gear is now. The pro being that a level 47 blue isnt BiS over anything else until T2 like things in vanilla were. But a con being since nothing is standout like certain pieces were in vanilla, you literally don't care about what its called or what it looks like because of transmog.
---
I feel like hunter is a waste, as you already have a pet, the benefit of a second isn't that big.
---
Warlock pairs very well with just about everyone since they are a pet class. I'd say probably paladin/druid/shaman would be best because they can can all tank dungeons and dps/heal while leveling.
---
Good point. Not sure that people aged 35-45 are few in VK. Probably most of them are no longer waiting for the Classic. Although, here I am already completely unsubstantiated and am leaving for speculation and falsification.
---
You can but it's a shit spec
---
Although with no progressive itemization it's not nearly as terrible of a choice.
---
Tier 2 should spend some time as very good holy gear with a bit too much spirit. But with no progressive itemization of it, will always be spellpower. So bis will force you into it when BWL releases
---
Absolutely right OP.
---
Who else will stop the evil Alliance from spreading their corruption and grasp across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms?  Its only a matter of time before that Night Elf hunter or charged Reckadin strike down an innocent tauren or undead in those jungles of STV.  
---
You don't even have a town here, Alliance! Get out of here.
---
Despite the bugs, this is really cool, just for the talent order thing at the bottom. People can plan the order out and take a screenshot to use as reference while leveling. I love it.
---
This is one thing that hurt me so bad. I was not very good at professions when I was 14 years old. I didn't really have a concept for MMOs outside of grinding. I played a resto druid and ran Scholomance probably over a 100 runs with Enchanting. Disenchanted all the way up to 300 I believe before they made it only go to 75 and sold all the Shards until I had enough to buy the mount. The patch day that removed the old mount from the vendor and added the new mount was the same day I went to buy it. :(
---
Without a doubt there are some waiting just like us for the good times to return.
---
They're not releasing a physical collector's edition?
---
Maybe comes off that way but vanilla launch was a way different beast than private server launches. At the same time classic launch isn't going to be like either, so arguing either point is silly
---
&gt;it is just gear gated.
---
This is what I've been screaming since M+ was put into the game. I know MMOs all have loot treadmills, but M+ just feels like it doesn't fit into a MMO. 
---
I was a cheap way for them to extend content and I really don't think that many players actually enjoy it. 
---
I think dungeons need to have a cap on difficulty and I think TBC heroics were perfect. 
---
Raiding imo, should be the primary way to get the best gear in the game. 
---
M+ was put into the game for one reason only and that was to push WoW PVE into the e-sports scene.
---
Just a portion of the blame? lol
---
I used it through Karazhan since we were very caster-heavy. Finally got the 1h-oh as almost last priority.
---
You can find some historical data on the waybackmachine archive of allakhazam/thottbot. It's very spotty though.
---
Example

---
This sounds like some real Alliance propaganda, to me.
---
As far as we know it is going to be digital download only.  I hope blizzard makes an announcement about physical copies.
---
Shaman/Paladin or Druid.
---
Those classes can heal, so the Warlock can be quickly topped off after lifetapping. They don't compete for gear. They aren't 100% dependent upon mana for damage, so you'll always be able to keep killing.
---
Looks empty, like their values...
---
Agree with everything except retail dungeons being better. They don't even come close to vanilla dungeons imo. Huge, intricate, slow paced vanilla dungeons that you have to travel to on foot, retail dungeons are total garbage compared
---
I will be a god among boys with 20 ping
---
Hahahahah
---
No one on my server is gonna be ready to fight for devilsuar. It's gonna be glorious
---
Its not my fault all those people rolled on the wrong faction.
---
Choices have consequences. Maybe next time they won't roll as a female night elf or a ret paladin.
---
Mistake: Arcane Meditation (Mage) is only supposed to have 3 ranks, but here it's showing 5 ranks.
---
Hardcore guilds benched some players or demanded them to reroll just because the class they played was inferior. In TBC your class was always useful (unless you were playing a mage). I guess it helped casual guilds and that's all Blizard had ever cared about.
---
Yes, you're concerning yourself over technicalities though. WoW Classic team realizes sharding is bad. WoW Classic team realizes starting zones will be literally unplayable because the respawns rates are not high enough for 300 level 1s (this is how many people a starting area will have, provided two races dont share it, if we hit server cap of 2500 with an even faction/race distribution). WoW Classic team understands that inventing new tech to deal with this situation isnt viable, when the tech (sharding) to address it already exists. 
---
There is no reason to think they will share the entire world though.
---
It’s not even mmorpg anymore
---
I think tips out has a good vid on paladin/warlock duo leveling
---
Lots of people are asking for this, and a lot of us have played on pservers with custom MPQs that do exactly this. I would have thought it would be more work than Blizz wanted to put into it, but hoped at some point it would get the SC and WC3 treatment with a remaster, i.e. more than just shadows and water.
---
I've been playing a bit on a dueling server the last few days just to try the class out but it seems really difficult to win 1v1s.
---
Hunter, spriest, mage, warlock all seems to beat rogue 1v1? Am I just doing something wrong or are rogues just kind of overhyped?
---
That's one Hot Take you got there OP.
---
Lets see how it plays out.
---
Parts of this are good, parts are bad.
---
The good is that you'll get shadow weaving and vampiric embrace, which means really high uptime for healing. You also won't need to use PW:shield often, increasing your sustainability and downtime. You've got a character that can tank, a lot of CC, decent damage, heals, and SS with a rezz.
---
The downsides: Both classes by default rely very heavily on being able to grind/quest with zero downtime off of the last hit ability granting them increased mana recovery. So, now both classes are going to be going OOM a lot. Second, both of these are really DoT heavy. So, you'll be spending mana on putting on dots that will only get through a portion of their duration, which is really mana inefficient. Plus, there's gear competition, which I don't think is horrible but it isn't great.
---
HEre's what you do
---
They're casuals, they won't know
---
Just lie, pray none of them pay attention. And wear the correct gear
---
Ah yes. Now I know. Thank you.
---
&gt;private servers are shit, buggy and unreliable
---
Sounds like you didnt play them at all?
---
I, too, didn't care about LFR unless it was necessary (MoP legendary questline) or gave gear that's too good.
---
Some of us just want to use the gear we've earned to destroy people whose gear is inferior. I have an issue with people earning gear that allows them to compete with the gear earned by doing the hardest content in game.
---
With earthbound totem warlock can dot and kite forever.
---
Any healer class is going to be rock solid with a warlock. Warlock can life tapand dot indefinitely as long as they can receive healers and healer manages their mana well
---
I get the feeling that the kind of person who ganks on a pvp server is only doing it out of frustration that they're not allowed to join a children's soccer or t-ball league as an adult.
---
To expand upon this, if the lock is using the VW, the druid can go cat and dps. For tough fights he can pop out and heal the VW. Druid could tank or heal dungeons while leveling so you'd have a good chunk of your 5 man group made. Additionally, lock could SS druid and druid could rez Warlock - I think those are on similar timers, so you could each die once every 30 minutes without having to run back.
---
With Paladin and Shaman you have the same sort of flexibility while leveling 
---
Each of those classes offers the ability to heal and tank and some buffing/cleansing/purging support as well which the warlock lacks.
---
Sounds awesome ! Yeah will be easier going at a lan or just going over at a friends house to game togheter
---
So fucking true about following us to classic. People think the same ignorant mindset of players in 2005 is going to come back in Vanilla 2019. No. 95% of us will be over educated on the game, strats, gear, and comps. I'm not saying it will be completely toxic, but I know it won't be the same. There won't be that undergeared mage going 4v1 on high end players or any of that shit because they'll know what to do now. I excited for Classic but I know what it's going to be in 10-12months. I'm still 90% certain most dungeons I join will be quiet without anyone talking in chat too. Seems like a lot of people are bringing that up like their elitist mindset is going to change just because of Classic. lol
---
I just listened to your interview yesterday on Countdown to Classic, it was incredible! Thanks for your contribution to the community! &lt;3
---
I mean, yeah, Blizzard and their design decisions are still the main culprit behind the game's decline.
---
Im gonna be pissed if sharding stays longer than 1 week and if the servers cant handle 40v40 AT MINIMUM without lagging.
---
Not enough to make me quit but definitely makes the game feel shittier.
---
Yeah, I love leveling especially. The leveling process is so rushed.
---
He has his chicken though.
---
Who cares? The video is lame and over hyped. Run an UBRS for yourself
---
What are  you people talking about ?. They said "classic server option". Im guessing you go into the server list and select a classic server and hit play ?. Thought that was the thing taking all this time rebuilding it on the modern serverframe ?
---
&gt; but in subsequent playthroughs, it's just a race to end for the loot 
---
Imo it's the same in classic except that the first playthrough takes a lot longer. Once you kill Ragnaros, next week you try to do MC faster. It goes on and on until everybody is geared enough to do BWL 2nd boss.  
---
I still agree with OP tho. Loot feels unique in classic. But the grind for loot is the same at some point.
---
Same but with FFVII.
---
How is the HD remaster of FFX? I'm considering buying it.
---
My concern is not people buying the token for game time with gold, my concern is people buying them with money in turn selling them for gold. I don't care if "well they got the gold anyway" it's still an easy way to acquire gold yourself with little to no effort.
---
lol wtf. Good luck killing this NPC bud.
---
IMO druid is always one of the best duo levelers. They have very high sustain, so they'll be able to keep up with the warlock. Both of you will have situational rezzes, for great wipe recovery. They have heals, which turns their unused mana into a battery for the lock. If you want to do dungeons, druid is flat out my top pick, since they can fill any of the three roles. Plus, very little gear competition between the two classes.
---
The biggest downside will be that the druid has much faster move speed pre-40, so he has to slow down (physically) to keep pace.
---
With smart micro on the VW to trade tanking with the druid, you'll be at effectively zero downtime between pulls; and the druid can go a shred build for feared/tanked mobs, which does absolutely insane damage.
---
 **&lt;TBD&gt; {Alliance PvP} {West Coast Semi-Hardcore} {LC}**   
---
 **What are our goals?**   
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We expect to clear every 40 man raid first. We intend to be the top guild and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.    
---
We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged. We plan to start premades when the first BG's are released.    
---
**Why should you join us?**   
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released. Our guild will have competitive raid spots and as such this will foster a guild that will excel at all aspects of Classic. Raid times are favorable for all NA timezones.     
---
Raid times will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST.    
---
**Want to know more?**  
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly.    
---
We are currently closed on Hunter and Druid applications for raiding, but are accepting all other classes.    
---
We will accept any class for casual raiding; and PvP.
---
He was super cereal...
---
You can sell a token for gold, on Retail only. Retail gold and Classic gold are two separate and distinct things. You cannot sell a token for a gold on Classic.
---
Downvoted even though I upvoted the OP.
---
nofunallowed.jpg
---
&gt; both classes are going to be going OOM a lot
---
I disagree. The warlock can life tap, priest heals/renews him. If the priest needs mana at this point, sit and drink while the warlock goes ahead and pulls the next mob(s). A non issue if the priest can ensure the last hit with Spirit Tap.
---
&gt; both of these are really DoT heavy
---
I'm confused. Priest only has 1 DoT...? Regardless, SW:P hits like a truck and you can downrank if that single DoT is breaking your mana-bank.
---
same sub as retail. 15 a month ya buy it and you can play both
---
My mate and I are doing a rogue/lock atm, works pretty well and fun
---
On my iPhone it’s a little buggy. The icons while using either Safari or Chrome tend to reset, changing to random icons within the build. (All my software is up to date).
---
Nobody should be using this, but the final point, for “Arcane Power” in the mage tree never becomes available. But again, nobody should be using this, so it’s probably best to just leave that bug there!
---
Also, needs verification, but iirc the third rank of improved shield block in the warrior prot tree only increases the duration, and doesn’t add an additional block - but I could be wrong.
---
Those are the only two classes I’m familiar with for vanilla, so I didn’t check any others. Thanks for a great tool, though! I’ll definitely be checking for updates from ya!
---
Mind expanding on the farce comment? Not sure what you mean (haven't played BfA).
---
I feel your pain
---
I don't see how this is different from spamming the same 10 raids every week or clearing the same handful of heroics every day to get a 1% drop rate mount though, outside of the illusion of choice you're giving yourself depending on the order you do the dungeons in. I get that you want to be able to target a specific mount, like how the Sha of Anger works, but this is just an illusion of choice that is bottlenecked by drop chance. You have a higher probability of getting one of your mounts from an island, for example, than you do from getting the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent, which is something like a 0.03% drop chance. Also, there are a couple of things you need to remember:
---
1. Mounts aren't the only cosmetic from islands, and they share the spotlight with other rewards like gear and pets. This needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating the mounts themselves. They're not a bonus on-top of loot like they are in dungeons and raids.
---
2. Island Expeditions are a viable gold farming strategy, so you're getting incremental value that vastly outweighs other mount farming methods. You can use this gold to invest in BMAH mounts you may not have, or other goods. 
---
I can see why you're frustrated, you don't have agency in targeting a specific mount, and that's annoying. You can't just smash your face into Strathome 6 times an hour until the Deathcharger drops. It's a slightly different kind of mount grind from the ones we've seen in the past (albeit not much different from having a heroic dungeon or raid list that you cycle through) but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. It adds exclusivity and rarity to the mounts, which is something we've definitely lost in recent expansions aside from Mythic mounts for current content (and even those are buyable).
---
Work harder Blizzard!!! Lol
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769548630#post-15
---
They literally did
---
Truthfully you may enjoy a fresh character in BFA.  I leveled from 1-110 last expansion on a monk because I knew leveling a class I was previously familiar with would piss me off.  It was a good relaxing experience.  And yes it was rushed.
---
Dagger rogue is usually done by the best gnome/dwarf cuz humans get the swords for pve
---
Race is the big definer here unless you're gonna rank and get the weapons
---
The sit macro thing is so annoying to do while leveling anyway, even if it was a thing. Same with frontstabbing. Not worth twitching my fingers back and forth so I can kill a mob a few seconds faster. 
---
Funny to see people still doing this on private servers. They will be very disappointed come Classic.
---
It's pretty obvious Blizzard took a good hard look at OSRS and decided their new shit wasn't going anywhere.
---
We are simply reminiscing of the times we would do this for games we were excited about, and hoping they would release a physical copy for the old school fans that remember and appreciated the midnight release hype. I am sure everyone here is aware of the classic server option hence the "I wish this would happen post" hope that clarifies this for you.
---
We literally have video evidence of sit-critting working in retail vanilla.
---
Whether or not it will work in Classic is still unknown, since the playable demo was so horribly un-polished and had tons of shit that was broken and not-vanilla-like.
---
Back in Vanilla I leveled with a bud who was a Mage. The two of us:
---
Food and Drink at all times
---
High burst
---
DoTs
---
High mobility
---
Pet to tank
---
Insane CC
---
Ports because fuck yeah
---
Healthstones
---
Excellent AOE
---
Excellent Single Target
---
We took out way too many mobs and elites we had no business even messing with. Would frequently 2v3-4-5 in PvP with ease. Survived more than we should have.
---
Just so much fun.
---
How many Ret paladins did you use  lol
---
I'm not going to vote anyone up or down I'm just here for the experience.
---
Until the game becomes an elitist shit show where you can't get into pre-made BG's unless you have a level 35 green offhand lolol. Then all these "unique" items that aren't rare because everyone knows every strategy, become a tedious requirement to go do a low level quest.
---
&gt; You cannot sell a token for a gold on Classic.
---
Source for this claim? It's just speculation at this point, no? I'm not saying you can or can't. Just saying that I hope you can't as it will ruin some major aspects of the game.
---
Yep and some are already at 5
---
I mained feral from vanilla to Cata and didn't learn the MCP trick before I started playing private servers. Definitely had no idea about it during TBC but I suspect that sick staff from the Nagrand Ring of Blood questline was already better. Just a guess tho.
---
The ideal scenario is connecting yourself to some mages/locks and you all just aoe farm
---
Gathering professions are generally best. Skinning/herb or skinning/mining then engineering/herb as an ideal post AV release. But herb can be replaced with anything.
---
Engineering is a must
---
It’s not lame... it is staged though, sadly.
---
&gt; The good ones don't include this crap.
---
sit-critting works on literally every vanilla pserver
---
lol
---
Amazing! Especially The Plaguewoods, it really captures the oppressiveness of northern EPL.
---
Yup. Always have attack/follow on their own buttons. Send them in when you want, recall them when you want. Especially in dungeons NO PET SHOULD BE IN AUTO MODE.
---
&gt;Seems like they actively try to have people spread out rather than clustering in one spot
---
Which is what ruined the game.
---
They need to remove any and all "Instancing" and leave servers are they are. If there is a player there on that server, you see them. That's it.
---
they said that Content be progressed. (quests, items, etc)
---
Only systems won't be (changes to quests, items, mechanics).
---
I.e. Alas Andorhol will be in it's 1.12 form from the start (no destroying crystals to summon Araj) but Riventusk Village and Thorium Point won't exist until Phase 3.
---
"the pserver community" is the entire reason we have Classic in the first place.
---
Shoo.
---
Even the worst hack&amp;slash has unique items with cool effects.
---
WoW became something worse than a hack&amp;slash. Its more like Candy Crush than it is Diablo 3.
---
....why wouldn't it?
---
I feel the same way but on a pserver... I’m like “I’m putting all these hours into a character that will be erased when classic comes out.” I have no attachment to the character and get burner out
---
For pvp, what class is the most difficult? I imagine a frost mage because of their ability to kite a hunter in his deadzone. Any tips on how to handle that ?
---
Deep ret is real strong up until the late 40s when your damage starts to fall off.
---
Don't go aoe spec if your not a seasoned veteran and especially on a new server on your first character..
---
if they do make a change like that il probably be going back to private servers... people should have a game they used to own, and changes like sharding are not welcome so if your not satisfied on the first week on vannila let them know by going back to private , along with the rest
---
Thanks for the link, I'll be sure to bookmark it for when it's finished!
---
Lovely picture!
---
mouse wheel up and down is good for pet attack and follow
---
I"m playing a private TBC server until classic launches so I'm not getting burned out of vanilla, while also playing the best wow's expansion ever &lt;3
---
Interesting. I heard Hunters were soft-countered by Paladins, but I guess that's false info then?
---
We are not being overhyped by blizzard.
---
You/everyone else is allowing yourselves to be too hyped.
---
It will come when it comes. Go enjoy other shit and don't be hung up on a game that will literally not be out for like 2 months.
---
&gt; but it kind of rubs me in the wrong way when people have practiced on PTR and then it is thought as day1
---
Even without PTR we'd still have day1 raid clears because this is a 15 year old game and everyone knows it inside and out.
---
You don't get pack till 40 unfortunately.
---
In my case (Brazil) unfortunatelly it will be the opposite way.
---
Only on private servers I could play with 10~30ms. In official servers I'll have to play with 120ms+ latency :(
---
Per usual I see a bunch of people here who don't know what they are talking about, the answer is deep ret and it's not even a debate.
---
p servers will always be there, and il be on them if they " tweeked " anything of importance in vannila
---
LOL, I cannot even tell you the comp at that point - I have been trying to read the names on the frames, but to no avail.
---
I myself played as a rogue, so I only cared about stabby stabby and the hopes of a Perdition Blade.
---
Truly the one of the most game changing things about Classic will not be all the stuff we know but all the stuff we misremembered.
---
https://youtu.be/4cGw7D1eGGc
---
This better not happen again. I expect the entire server to be there for the AQ event.
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
I'm not sure if they clarified what their stance on macros will be. 
---
It's a legion client and you could do some broken things with the original system
---
Yup, the only items that really still can be like that are trinkets. I played in legion, still remember the trinket from guldan in nighthold, draught of souls on fury warrior which boosted your dps for like 50% or some crazy shit and was basically better on the lowest ilvl than the next best trinket available on the highest. Everything else is basically just looking for your best secondary stat and the highest ilvl available of item with those stats.
---
It's ganking, and it's okay.
---
People that don't like it feel free to roll on a PvE server.
---
It's worse only in the sense that a tank is the most vital position in any group where as one retarded dps can usually be carried by the others.
---
Anything specific you are looking for?
---
Nah, it's okay
---
if you're not concerned with speed, then it doesn't matter what class you duo with. pick whatever your friend wants to play.
---
That is indeed something the law must establish, and it is currently rushing (snail paced, as it does) to do so. I am still doing my studies and dont feel i know where i think the line should be yet, but it very much should be there. Will be interesting to find out what Belgium decides on the matter (with their lawsuit against loot boxes etc)
---
If this is how bad Classic Wow is I'll be doing an immediate chargeback and quitting for good. 
---
Blizzard, get your fucking shit together.
---
They can't
---
Vanilla last 2.5 years.   It ended 12 years ago.
---
You hear scrubs talk about 14 years experience.   How can you have 14 years experiences for sometime that didn't even exist for 3 years?
---
And there is the birth of pserver heroes.
---
Amen to that
---
u jelly
---
I was actually hyped for BfA, i played Legion quite a bit and was hoping that WoW was turning around. Maybe Ion Hazzikostas had managed to get some Elitist Jerks fanservice in there but i was horribly wrong.
---
Warfronts are a shadow of what it should have been, so are Island Expeditions. 
---
If they would just have made Warfronts something like "castle sieges" in an open world pvp environment then i would have been playing BfA 25 hours per day probably.
---
Make the Warfront zone owning faction gain access to extra content and make them "contested" every 4 hours or something and let both factions battle for supremacy in a huge-scale open world pvp battle. BOOM successful expansion.
---
Ressing on spirit will break your gear even if it's on the bags
---
Haha that's awesome. Yes I meant sick. Do you play in first person? I don't have a treadmill but I think that would make a big difference. Otherwise sitting playing wow with my headset on would get old really fast
---
Thats fair. I personally would feel whelmed acquiring it, as i know those who do not recognize it are likely to mistake it for a green item. To each their own.
---

*logs onto main*
---
And what did it cost?
---
I'm not entirely sure what the point of your comment here is. Content is made easier once you outgear it, yes, but that has always been the case in WoW, always. What makes mythic raiding difficult is that it is tightly tuned for an entire raid equipped in bis gear executing rotations perfectly. In mythic + players are, on the other hand, able to push the boundaries of what should be theoretically possible with the gear they currently have at their disposal. Yes, it is always the same content but the strategy changes depending on the affixes and level of difficulty as abilities that you did not even notice might one shot you on +20. 
---
I've raided in vanilla, I've  raided mythic on retail and pushed at least +20 in mythic+ in every single dungeon and what I can tell you from my experience is that while retail does many things wrong, it atleast provides the option of trully challenging PvE content which cannot really be said for vanilla.
---
&gt; Effectively solving your mana issues as long as there's Judgement of Wisdom
---
No decent guild is allowing JoW on every boss so just like that the discussion is over.
---
Also as much as I see people claiming spelladin is now a thing I haven't seen any logs provided that show one doing more than 400-500 dps in a raid to make them not a meme.
---
Listening to him on ClassiCast is rough. He has ZERO ideas of his own and just reiterates whatever the last person said. I've never liked his content. I DID like the video of his where he talked with Monkeynews about the Warrior class. As that video goes on and you hear how much of an expert Moneynews is of the class you get the impression that Tips has NO idea about most the mechanics or how a Warrior is played and he apparently "mains" the class. Wish people would see that and not follow his channel or information.
---
Are you hoping that the one feared with dots is about dead before it gets to you given that you’ll take hits if you don’t kite it since VW won’t be able to take aggro after?  Any time you’d ever use Imp of VW when leveling?
---
You're basically just using more words to state the same thing that I said earlier:
---
&gt;Modern WoW architecture doesn't seem to be able to handle any sort of large-scale open world PvP.
---
It's difficult finding enough healers and warlocks. There is never a shortage of rogues/hunters/warriors.
---
You're right, the best kind of right.
---
My guess will be like any regular expansion. First past the post will make a good profit then the market gets saturated. Eventually bouncing back (if classic stays relevant long enough, which I hope is the case)
---
**HARDCORE RAIDER LOOKING FOR HCORE RAIDING GUILD:**
---
* NA West
---
* Hardcore raider / PvP
---
* Alliance
---
* I can play at all times. I play roughly 9-10 hours a day.
---
* I prioritize raiding above all, then pvp. I always socialize and am really chill.
---
* No racists is my only rule.
---
* Discord. Hunso#0074
---
Especially once you start stacking shadow dmg gear.
---
The people in your pug were absolute trash then. I could out dps a aq40/naxx geared paladin on a pre-bis rogue.
---
2 weeks is a minimum.  I also take 2 weeks of leave only for that, it seems "normal".
---
They are in the internal alpha. I think they’ll be in for phase one and then be removed.
---
Kargoz says pally is good.  Healing, tanking, BoW.
---
How is anyone going to stress the servers when sharding is active? We don't even know if we'll have a beta but with sharding active on the demo and launch, I don't see why that would be any different.
---
When I played on private servers pretty hardcore (nost&gt;ely&gt;LH&gt;start of ND) this was not the norm at all in raiding guilds in my experience. Most guilds didn't require full consumes for raids on farm, they didn't even require full consume (flask etc) for progression. Most guilds also didn't require world buffs or collect them as a guild, they were usually an optional thing to get outside raid times if you wanted to. There was a small minority of very hardcore guilds that required all of this but certainly not most raiding guilds.
---
Thank you very much for the information! I will definitely be looking back on this thread do help me decide what build I'm gonna go with but it seems like Sm/Ruin was the most suggested and seems like its my best bet for decent endgame in both PvP and PvE
---
Why did we always feel the need to mute in-game audio and put in our own music? I did the same thing lmao.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_rHqqYnh18&amp;t=27m15s
---
TLDR: Pally or Druid
---
And what gear are you using the meantime while farming MC and progressing through BWL? Also in my experience T2 is decently contested because its really good for farming and open world pvp.
---
&gt; week long AV
---
We're not going to have that either.
---
How dependent are Destruction Warlocks on raid gear? I want to play Destruction Warlock (big numbers) in open world PvE, but since i've never played vanilla, i'm not sure if raiding is necessary for open world pve viability (?) (I don't want to raid, maybe dungeon, but thats about it)
---
Same. Im also 24 and I remember playing in vanilla but dont think i ever made it past \~40. Raided a little in TBC and finally started really getting into it in Wrath, doing most raids and getting pretty good at 2v2 and 3v3 arena and then quit in Cataclysm. Since then i have played quite a bit vanilla on private servers and can't wait to do all the content i never got to do back then.
---
Yeah, there is very little a Shaman and Warlock can't kill together.
---
Standard priest leveling is DoT+wand. SWP is their only dot (outside of devouring plague, but yeah), however it's really stacked up with improved SWP and shadow weaving; so although it's only 1 DoT it's a large portion of their damage.
---
Neither will be able to fill out their whole cycle without burning through mana too fast. If I were doing a duo as priest/lock, I'd probably throw on corruption and SWP, maybe CoA, and wand it to death. I'd have to try it out to see if you're mana capping too much, but I doubt you would be. Your clear speeds will still be pretty high and you'll have the mana to keep heals on the VW or bubble when the VW is OOM to keep grinding with no downtime.
---
I'm just saying you will need to be much more mana conscious running them duo than you would running either one solo. Both are only getting 50% efficiency from their highest sustainable talent.
---
[My Sack is "Gigantique"](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=1165/my-sack-is-gigantique)!
---
Yeah you would be, but it barely matters honestly.  Warlock and priest can level nude if they want to.
---
I’m jelly of earned fame, not that joke
---
I think forcing people to work for things is what makes a game good and makes the struggle worth it. You can call it entitled, but the reality is that this is a game and as a game there should be earned rewards. The more you start handing things out, the less fun the game is. It’s literally the problem with the game right now. 
---
So yeah, I want them to gate content from people who can’t achieve it. That makes it worth it for everyone instead of watering it down for everyone. I’m tired of the hand holding and the optional hard modes. Dark souls didn’t have an easy mode because it made you work for certain content. You don’t get to face the Lich King with blue gear and laziness. We had to earn it and it was worth it. If ICC had LFR it would have watered the whole fuckin thing down. 
---
God I swear it’s like /r/WoW users have started brigading this subreddit defending the shittiest parts of retail.
---
It doesn't matter.  They exist in retail, thus you will be able to buy gold in Classic.  There *will* be an exchange rate between retail and classic for gold....you'll be able to find someone to trade you X amount of gold in Classic for a token's worth of gold in retail.
---
&gt;All addons deserve to exist, it's up to the players if they use them or not.
---
Not really, there are addons like old decursive which broke gameplay and got removed by blizzard, and they confirmed on classic panel that they will not allow for functionality of some of these vanilla addons in classic
---
Like Aaod mentioned, try to have your warrior leave the killing blows to you when possible.  Spirit tap only procs if you finish the mob.
---
As far as spec goes you could go any spec for leveling with a warrior, and truthfully on a private server that shall not be named, I healed dungeons just fine as shadow.
---
Generally speaking a lot of people argue to stay holy/disc (with spirit tap) until 45, but  I found going shadow at 40 to be really effective.  Also your vamp touch will passively heal your warrior as shadow.
---
No. I’m using this time to level on a pserver to practice routes and perfecting my class skills.
---
Yea man its so braindead, so braindead you can only pull one mob at a time usually while questing... so braindead you have to use CC in dungeons... damn thats pretty braindead.
---
At the shop.  You just bought it.  They changed models in 1.4 or so.  If you still had the old one and wanted the new one you could trade it in, but you could no longer buy the old ones.  They won't be in.
---
I'm not to familiar with Warrior, as I've never played one. I know very little about that spec in itself. I've heard that the spec is not very great in PvE, as they aren't as good of tanks as Protection spec warriors, and I've also heard you can get more DPS with a Fury spec warrior. Is there any benefits this spec holds greatly over the others?
---
Just so you know, taurens aren't able to ride them
---
Yeah, I'm looking forward to being in a raid and seeing a pserver heroes get one shot because he doesn't have a shield.   Than cry that he's done it for the past 5 years.   No you haven't, the game didn't even part 5 years, and you were 11 when it ended!.
---
Just wish he actually made content, not just a 10 minute (ad-money) video reading a blue post.
---
EXACTLY
---
Never forget the backdash gliding strats.
---
druids suck in BG's/open world relative to pally/priest with a team
---
Druids are flag carries in WSG and hold the caps in AB
---
They are never used as pure support. If you're the only dispel you should probably go paladin. If you're gonna have a warlock with felhunter or another healer with you u can consider priest. But paladin is much stronger if you only have one support in the group.
---
So because people can push buttons fast they can fly through vanilla, gotcha makes sense. People amaze me with stupidity everyday in this thread.
---
i love looting these
---
Oh dang I didn’t know this. Glad I switched from Rogue to Warlock
---
Well yes gamebreaking addons or addons that automate gameplay can obviously not exist.
---
I just bought a gaming laptop for the exact same reason!  I already have a little one here but my second is on the way (this coming summer).
---
All these were on minute of server launch. Two orcs 1 dwarf. 
---
Basically the best tactic is always to skip the first quest in zone. For orc I immediately did sarkoth for lvl 2 then got imp quest and did that + the boss followup. That alone is enough for lvl4 with 2man group and then I went outside and 2man quested to 10. For dwarf I did roughly the same except you have to grind to 2, then do boar quest into troll quest and the followup.
---
Riiiiiiight wink wink
---
Jeff is one of few people left at blizzard that actually gives a fuck. Bless him.
---
how do you explain I am addicted to only one game then ?
---
I mean I kind of expect it from time to time. It's niche info and this subreddit is a circle jerk of massive proportions.
---
But cash flow won't be ridiculously high... In a sense...
---
I wish I was you. I’m back in school full time for a Nursing degree.
---
Different height not size
---
Well there are still gonna be addons that automate gameplay (presumably), like lazypig. It's just smaller scale automation
---
Numbers will be a lot lower that’s for sure. But I still think the trends will translate
---
It's going to be, 'i want to have the nostalgia and the edit options! I want 1.4.2.5!' etc etc.
---
You can solo level as heal
---
You should not because it will be slow as fuck
---
I think Hunter. You both have pet heals so you don’t have to worry about taking damage. You won’t fight over fear. You can each have your own different professions.
---
Hi, my name is xjaydeusx and I'm an altoholic
---
I play mobile phone games that seem to handle all of that no problem, all while displaying hundreds of unique players at the same time. 
---
What's blizzard's excuse?
---
Security's gotta be tight there. I mean, would you want any of the general crazy from this sub just rolling up to your workplace?
---
You said particle affect don't cause lag, I tried to extrapolate what it was that was in fact causing the issue and why it might not be a problem in vanilla by virtue of it being s simpler game with less things that affect other players.
---
This was funny the first time. Now I just get a heart attack every time I see these kind of posts.
---
Classic will use the BfA API for the most part but some things will obviously need to be removed if they have no use in Classic, some things will have to be changed because the game systems are different.
---
So depending on the addon it could very well work with Classic out of the box but a lot of them will require small tweaks.
---
Most addons from 2004-2006 will not work at all.
---
I agree and I never said particle affects do, just what might be the cause and why it might be better in classic.
---
For sure, enjoy until bots take over
---
WPvP is not only done solo. Rogues aren't that great on a wPvP party/raid like a TM vs SS.
---
Uh... We need the evil enemy to level faster so we have someone on the other side to Q for BGs.
---
pserver im on is 99% perfect.  some overtuned mobs and pathing(lol @ pet running off into distance), other than that its went down like once in over 6 mo of playing, not counting the 1 day they patched something. one day, not every freaking tuesday.   
---
You must have played on some turd, insta 60 paytowin server. If so, you get what you deserve imo lol
---
Blizzard has dumbed down the character stat panel that people need an add-on just to know where their crit is coming from. In fact the base stat panel doesn't even show movement speed.
---
Because apparently the music choice back them was:
---
Drowning pool - Bodies
---
Dragonforce - Through the fire and the flames
---
Ahhh rip
---
Cool, good info to have. Whole reason for making this post.
---
Good to know.
---
I'm just going to be like "it's close enough, appreciate it for qhat it is and stop bitching about what it's not."
---
Lol?
---
I what way is making a joke video and intentionally distributing it, having it blow up and become such a cultural phenomenon the meme is referenced on Jeopardy! not earned fame?
---
While it is a good idea; this community will downvote it without reading it cuz the no-change circlejerk is up its own ass at this point.
---
BfA’s not in my life. No point. Waiting patiently for Classic!
---
Dude died, man. RIP. Leave a bucket on the curb in his honor.
---
fuckoff
---
It would be a good way to sink money. Healthy imo.
---
Thats not called passion, thats called greed.
---
Nihilism was earned game. Swifty was earned famed. Death and Taxes was earned fame. Running into a bunch of whelps is just stupid.
---
Luckily it will be harder to bot. They will always find a way but will have to revert to old tricks in a new way. New client should be better equipped to detect programs than the vanilla launcher was capable of.
---
I have a 20 euro ssd and couldn't be more happy. If the computer is only to play classic this might even be enough as a sole hard drive ( I personally have a 1 tb HDD) it's a Kingston from Amazon. The same one as I got costs 30euro for 240gb. This is enough disc space to not even buy a HDD if it's only for wow
---
This might be the best worst vanilla wow video I've ever witnessed.
---
It will inflate the economy to ridiculous levels over the course of the game. Inflation is already a problem, since there just aren't enough massive gold sinks to curb inflation long term. Epic mounts are only 1k, all skills are only a hundred or so, profession mats are cheap, along with FPs and repairs... If you add in something like wow tokens, so that people will grind just to be able to play, it'll make the economy even worse and it'll do it far, far faster than if it didn't exist.
---
Long term server sustainability is already an issue that people aren't sure how to tackle. Let's not make it worse.
---
This reminds me that if you hit a character in the back it either crits higher or hits them larger. I cannot remember  which one.
---
In the world of retail.  Gold is irrelevant.  In vanilla and classic, gold was a major factor in everything from levelling, crafting to raiding.
---
The economy of a server would be altered negatively if you introduced it.
---
So you know this will get downvoted, yet you're posting it anyway...
---
It isn't a gold sink because it doesn't take money out of the economy. In fact, it'll do the exact opposite and spike inflation as people grind more gold just to pay their sub.
---
Why would it be affected?
---
Thank god it won't be a thing. Warrior leveling is tedious as it is.
---
I think once you go through the step by step process of how such a transaction would even occur you’d understand how utterly remote and unlikely it would happen with any sort of regularity because the market would depend on a seller of Classic gold needing Retail gold in the first place (highly unlikely).
---
How do you even determine a fair exchange rate between Classic and Live to know how much to sell it for? Right now 120k gold is a lot on Live and you need to farm a lot to get that much each month.
---
This was WAY better than I was expecting
---
Oh shit, I didn't know. I was like "What are you people talking about? I've seen bags drop at Level 1 before, it ain't hard"
---
Dist not for PvP? Ok
---
100% can confirm
---
Also you may end up with a bunch of people only playing classic to feed their retail sub if classic tokens are the path of least resistance
---
Your concern should go both ways IMO because for people buying game time with gold there must be people buying that time with real money and then selling it for gold, it doesn't work otherwise.
---
Anyway I don't believe they'll put the token on classic because it wouldn't make any sense, they want more people on retail and they'll have that with no token on classic if people want to pay their subs with gold (have to grind retail). I also believe this is one of the reasons why the sub is shared.
---
Thank you. 
---
I was using wowhead but theirs is trash on mobile.
---
Jamie pull up my bank account.
---
This is trash on mobile.
---
It's situational in the sense that if the druid is main tanking you use it, if you're off tanking you don't.
---
MCP provides so much threat that if you have the oppurtunity to use it every time you MT, you do. The ~1000 armor from Warden Staff is negligible when you already have 10-15k armor.
---
wow!!!
---
They claim that sharding will only be present in the first zone. STV and the rest of the world will not have sharding.
---
What if instead of codes to get the spectral tiger, tabards, and other TCG items those same vendors were used to get these old unarmored mounts?
---
Fair enough.
---
I don't think "extra math" (modifiers, procs, effects, etc) is a very significant contributor of lag. Especially not on a level where the entire game breaks down if more than a handful of people try to PvP in BFA, as opposed to hundreds of players flawlessly engaging in PvP while playing on a hack job private vanilla server hosted out of bumfuck Romania.
---
The rest of the stuff you mentioned (packet size, frequency, etc) is what I meant when I mentioned networking architecture.
---
It's possible that Blizzard *could* improve this stuff to make WoW Classic playable, and they'll pretty much have to... but would I be surprised if they didn't and the game was an absolute shit show for months? Nah, not at all. That's my concern.
---
No u
---
No you both
---
Maybe not a bad game for the NEWER generation of players (only end game/ilvl matters, skip leveling and ignore anything else irrelevant like professions) but for the rest of us retail is nothing more than a nostalgic memory and a hollow shell of its former self.
---
Hey, send me a pm
---
you are very much welcome :)
---
I could not agree more! The sense of accomplishment was phenomenal when progressing through a raid with your guild. It definitely took teamwork and coordination, as well as being properly geared and spec’d.
---
If you could only buy it and not sell it, then yes it would just be a gold dumb, but if you are able to sell it then no it would ruin the economy for the server.
---
OP: "Hey guys look at this cool picture!"  
---
You: "The place you live sucks!"  
---
That's not how people talk in polite conversation.
---
Hey send me a pm
---
I'm struggling with this. I played Alliance only during Vanilla, so thought it would be great to go Horde. Only now I'm thinking I loved vanilla alliance zones so much, maybe I should go that way? But then I think I want to play a Vanilla Shaman. so who knows.
---
No thanks for me.
---
Finally, someone that actually read the post. Thank you.
---
&gt; people most excited about Classic are actually familiar with BC and have an idealized representation of Classic in their mind.
---
This. It was difficult in Russia back in 2004-2005 to have a decent internet connection, even in large cities (I personally had to use dial-up till 2006 for reasons).
---
The second problem for people willing to play WoW was a bank card. As far as I remember, a bank card was required to register an account. Many high school or university students didn't have a bank card, so they had to ask their friends or older relatives to allow them to use their bank card number for registration. After that it was possible to buy a 60-day time card in game shops. So most of real vanilla players were at least 22+ years old and had a job.
---
But this pool represents a specific population, cause an average Vkontakte user is young (from 10 to 30 years old). Back then forums were much more popular. Now older gamers prefer Facebook.
---
So a real Russian vanilla player had to be at least an unversity student to be able to pay a subscription, to have a bank card and also a good internet connection. Most vanilla players I know are in their mid-thirties now or at least 30 years old.
---
Physical boxes &gt; digital download
---
That is all
---
This made no sense, u still do the raids and that’s the rpg aspect. U do raids the same way u did in classic for gear. Mythic dungeons is just additional and bonus content, it’s not the only thing in the game. How do people get bonus content confused with main gameplay and content? And yes stat priority is important still.
---
I initially just read the top part and then saw the bottom .
---
He's wrong though. Paladin's have Blessing of Freedom and can't be slowed. Cleanse removes Poison, Disease and Magic effects.
---
Excellent job! New meme bar set for this sub
---
“An error occurred, please try again later”
---
all depends on if you spend time leveling the profession so that it stays equal with your level progression. For me the drive to get a new character level was just so much greater than my drive to level up my professions so by level 30 I would still be at ~40 tailoring points and in order to level it up it would require me to grind materials or spend gold. Both of which wouldn't get me exp and so it never seemed worth it. Once I got a mount at 40 I assumed it would help make farming materials/gold easier and I'd want to level up my profession. Still didn't end up doing it until level 60. 
---
So basically, if you want them to matter and spend time on them, they will make your character better for sure at whatever level you are. But what's the point in spending ~20 hours making sure your level 38 has a pretty decent chest piece when those 20 hours could be spent getting you to level 43 and now that 38 green chest you could have made isn't that great. 
---
If you enjoy leveling your profession as you level do it. But if you're doing it just so that you can make gear, I just don't think it's worth the time when you'll level out of that gear in the time it takes to make it. 
---
That said, I'm going to do my best to keep my professions at my char level this time around. I plan on playing with friends who don't seem as super into Classic as I am so I expect a lot of alone time on server where I don't want to out-level my friends and I plan to grind my professions with that time.
---
It would literally be a gold dump. It won’t affect the economy. You can choose to buy it or not. OP said you shouldnt be able to sell it on classic - only buy it.
---
The answer is always paladin.
---
🌄**&lt;Lakeshire Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance)** **(Maybe RP-PVP, Guild Vote)**🌄
---
What is Lakeshire Guard?
---
Lakeshire Guard is a moderate to hardcore raiding guild with strong PVP ties to Lakeshire and the Redridge Mountains! Though we aren't RPPVP we do immerse ourselves to do what it takes to defend Lakeshire, and maintain a fairly serious attitude about raiding and our strategies as a guild.
---
We will have a 3 part looting system that includes loot council, "wishlist" item for the current raid, and luck. We would like to offer the best in preparedness, but also want to be open to a total of 80+ unique players who want to play the race and class they desire! We will have priority raid group, and secondary raid groups. and sometimes these groups will inter-mix to gear certain players from the main raid.
---
We don't want to exclude any players from progressing so these raid swaps and off groups will only be for progression weeks, months. We want to be as fair and fun to everyone within our Guard! If someone else gets the loot, remember they are a Guard, and what they get benefits Lakeshire and all of our members.
---
Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you at the Inn.

Please read the Bulletin-Board and apply in the applications within the Discord.

Zoomed in running in circles around people dueling hahaha
---
Kargoz had a good one in this. Duo leveling two warlocks. You can drain Mama from your pets via Dark pact and Set them on passiv. They wont get infight and always are out of the 5 second rule so they are regging Hard.
---
12 years ago was 2007. This was towards the end of WoW vanilla. This truly adds a new dimension to the terribleness of the video, but you know what? It was this terribleness, this naiveness, that was so special to our WoW experience.
---
Seriously. Blizzard is just drip-feeding us information about the game. We need some actual gameplay! A beta, a PTR, anything!
---
To pay for your subscription?  For guilds/players that play both?   I wrote a huge post about this having a conversation with someone about similar things the other day.  I've seen this happen *regularly* in other MMOs to transfer items/gold cross faction and servers.    It will happen.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bk20no/blizzard_updating_wow_token_files_in_classic/emeakr3/
---
Read the post man. All OP is suggesting is if you have extra gold on Classic you can use it to buy gametime. Not like in retail how you can spend real money to get in game gold.
---
You will absolutely notice a difference. Pvp in vanilla was completely different than retail today.  I was in Arthas back in the day and it had a horde 3x1 alliance ratio. So horde was constantly attacking you relentlessly.  If you really want to see what Vanilla felt like go PVP. As for which server, I honestly just picked the one that my friend was in( most of us probably did this) as long as we do not have ques to enter into the server I would go into a high population as the game feels more alive.
---
Has anyone ever posted a vanilla GY map on a perzone basis? I think that would be hugely helpful.
---
In the case of pservers, they didn't have any kind of bot detection at all, they relied entirely on player reports, as far as I know.
---
Almost every single time I made my way over to Dire Maul, I'd see at least 1 or 2 bots grinding mobs in Feralas.
---
Ah I wasn’t aware it would change macros.  Guess it’s a wait and see thing then.
---
I know I won't ever have enough extra gold to do this but I do like the idea of if people are willing grinding enough that the game becomes free to play
---
I can appreciate your perspective on it since it sounds like you have played both old school WoW and new school WoW. I tend to lean towards you are forgetting some of the specific mechanics that were required for a majority of the bosses (not all of them certainly). Most fights had debuffs and effects that were contagious or constantly being applied. 
---
Now it wasn’t until AQ and Naxx that more dynamic movements and rotations were introduced.  It sounds like they continued to add elements along these lines so I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it is more complex now than ever. I just was arguing against the claim that vanilla was rank and spank.
---
Refill on supplies often, keep your bags tidy, plan your route and make use of your bank.
---
A paladin cant do anything vs a hunter that knows how to properly kite enemies as far as i know. Even if a paladin cant be slowed a hunter runs 30% faster and will outrun the paladin easy.
---
He knows it will be downvoted because most people just read the title and ignore the actual post.
---
Sadly no. I just went with OPs assumption.
---
GL getting a spot as dps as a warrior or druid in a dungeon.
---
Harry Potter and the assault on Molten Core
---
He is an idiot.
---
They aren’t wrong on the fact that the pservers get a ton of stuff wrong though.
---
Yeah it's not like it's fucking hard to make a decent castle siege PvP scenario. DaoC had it figured out in 2001. It's baffling.
---
Do you have and a "realistic" bis ? because lets be  serious no one will  stay and farm for absolute bis + you dont need to be absolute bis to finish the raids.
---
You have done a very nice job with this list, thx for helping
---
1080
---
Correction: automate *combat* gameplay. LazyPig won't work in Classic though since it's made for a 14 year old API.
---
Completely different game.    
---
Be prepared to die, a lot.
---
What exactly is an ssd?
---
In theory that's the case with every class vs Hunter. However with Grenades, Holy Shock or Repentance among the usual fuck ups the playing field gets more even.
---
Good luck farming 120,000 gold in Classic AND immediately feeling the best use of that gold is $15.00.
---
ChinaFarmers were selling the gold needed for epic ground at easily $70/US on my original server. That is what, 1,000 gold?
---
It doesnt matter how great his idea is though.
---
We're not asking for Vanilla WoW 2.0, we want vanilla as it was, without tokens, class balances or w/e other BS people keep suggesting.
---
Yeah the game plays more like something you would buy content packs instead of pay for a constant service. Might as well wait until the last content patch of an expansion, go through all the story in 1 go, see all the raids through lfr and then wait 2 years for the last content of the next expack.
---
Well, if by immediately you mean four years afterwards, add explicitly stated in the intro cinematic.
---
I appreciate the candid feedback. I’m hoping to make friends to support since I’ll play more than my current friend group.  But that’s why I’m looking for something that I could respec and hybrid with.  This sort of rules out paladin but definitely could still do a priest
---
Because constant server crashing so no one can be part of it is an awesome experience that we all want to relive.
---
I used smites mighty hammer on my druid on nost till like mid 40s early 50s. Had to buy a green and it was only marginally better.
---
Dist? Or you mean disc?
---
They stated it would only be used in a limited capacity at launch, ie: starting zones for a few weeks maximum.
---
Some inaccuracies or slightly-off values, yes, "a ton of stuff wrong", no.
---
On a somewhat same note, does anyone know of any guides out there for 1-60 leveling with two people? A ton of the guides out there get skewed pretty badly when you are splitting the xp from kills between two people and skipping quests that would be hard to solo but easy to duo.
---
Passionate greed. Passionate about greed. Greedily Passionate.
---
Why not then also have no cc or no stuns? Or no heals? In fact why not white damage only naked with no weapons?
---
Well you aren't getting Vanilla as it was.  You are getting an interpretation of it.
---
&gt; and now they have to stat squish every other expansion
---
Which utterly breaks stuff too. The Demon Hunter starting area made you feel like a verified badass until the stat squish hit and now it's borderline undoable solo.
---
I wish there was some website to add up all your playtime, even from deleted chars and pservers.
---
Jintha alor comes to mind. Fond memories :)
---
Priest/Lock is a top tier duo for leveling.
---
Cheap fucking retard
---
me too buddy its nice to use it for testing to see if you enjoy the class
---
Then I don't think PVP is for you.
---
Lucky you found work in the nuclear power plant field.  My father got layed off after 30+ years of nuclear engineering.  
---
On a less depressing note, I can't wait to hop into azeroth again after work :D
---
I imagine they meant "the good \[guides\]", not "the good \[servers\]".
---
for PvP go Alliance ... NE hunter ... why? ... shadowmeld ... amount of utility you get with it is insane and yes stoneform is strong against rogues but believe shadowmeld gives more options 
---
wPvP can go insane with it ... battlegrounds also
---
If you want to go horde badly go for Orc hunter ... stun resist is a also insane but again ... I believe shadowmeld is OP
---
Ahh thx.
---
I hope this is how I feel too.  For now that's how i'm leaning... with trusting optimism on what I know so far.
---
I never thought of this and that’s cool!
---
The spells, effects and modifiers are so much more complex in modern wow, plus the sending of data and accuracy of positioning is several factors more accurate than vanilla.
---
Just look at spell batching - to get the same spell effect grouping as in vanilla they had to move all spells to the lowest priority in the games polling - otherwise it was impossible to recreate the same feeling of playing back then.
---
The likely answer is something in between - greater packet load and poorly optimisation in both code and server side.
---
I know that gold in Retail doesn't mean much, but what You suggesting is, basically, creating new money out of thin air. So, by helping one economy you effectively wrecking the other one.
---
Moreover, classic devs have already stated that Classic and Retail databases would be separated. 
---
So, it's never gonna happen.
---
Idk about that, but they definitely realized that they were wrong about people not knowing what they want from osrs. Classic and retail can both be successful, but blizzard has to get their heads out of their collective asses.
---
I'd just rather not have that option of having tokens in the game whatsoever. Just feels like a slippery slope.
---
I really wasn't hyped for classic at all until yesterday, now I'm so fucking stoked I can hardly stand it. I will be recreating my orc hunter in hopes of slaughtering as many Alliance scum as possible. 
---
I've been gaming for the better part of 20 years and without a doubt some of my fondest memories are from vanilla WoW. 
---
I've been gone for many years but am finally about to come home. LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
My dude literally nothing you said here makes sense. APM isn't just pushing your buttons fast, its pushing them fast and in the right order, and doing the right things with them. No one talks about APM as literally the raw amount of face rolling you can do, that makes no sense.
---
I also didnt say they'd fly through vanilla, that's a pure strawman. I said it's not that hard and they'll acclimate to the new environment if they feel like it. I didnt say or even imply that every retail player will be a speed runner.
---
They'll pull 4 Defias at once in Northshire, die, and then go, "Oh I can't do that." And then they'll either not do that anymore, or they'll quit because they can't be assed. It has nothing to do with difficulty.
---
Nahh I just focus on the Vs part of PvP
---
The largest inaccuracy I see with respect to Reckoning is players saying swapping your weapons will lose the stacks.  This is not true.  You can maintain your stacks of reckoning ONLY if you have no started an auto-attack while swapping weapons.
---
For example:
---
Rogue opens on you and you are stun-locked gaining reckoning swings.
---
Without previously attack the rogue, you equip your two hander, THEN attack the rogue.  You'll hit him in the face 5 times.
---
If you don't want to auto attack, the stacks will be lost.
---
Yeah Good luck with that #NoChange Circlejerk movement. 
---
The client is on modern WoW. 
---
They will add shards for the first few weeks to settle out launch. There will be bugs and glitches from modern WoW.
---
Giving players the option to buy a WoW token isn’t going to ruin your pure vanilla experience. Especially if its optional. 
---
So I don’t see why everyones getting so butthurt over an optional idea that doesn’t affect gameplay at all.
---
Easiest way to make friends is be good and do ur best to do ur role well
---
*shrug*
---
Same, Me and my friends played until 15 on a bliz-like server and then stopped, we all didn't feel motivated because it wasn't permanent, and didn't wanna get burnt out.  
---
Got us all super hyped though, we all only played during TBC/wrath and up, and back then was our fav
---
Ok, here's the text in it's entirety:
---
As you've noticed, the Classic Demo does have realm sharding. This is to let as many people as possible experience it without technical issues such as server capacity or spawn density getting in the way.
---
Longer term, we know how crucial it is to the Classic experience for you to see your friends when you walk into Stormwind or when you’re helping them on a quest you’ve already completed. And there should only ever be one Kazzak on a realm, no matter how many people are waiting for him to spawn.
---
We’re still looking at how we can best deliver an authentic Classic experience at launch, and in the weeks and months that follow - both in terms of gameplay and community. You won’t see phasing (which is tied to specific quests that don't exist in Classic) or cross-realm zones (which combine multiple realms together) in Classic. However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days. But we recognize that a cohesive world is critical to WoW Classic and are committed to bringing that to you.
---
If they did say that, than it should be easy for you to highlight where they did. Please feel free to do so and when you can't you don't have to admit you're wrong, just please stop spreading this "they said they won't shard" misinformation.
---
Which private server was it cleared on the day it released?
---
Ok, so let's fucking change everything then!
---
Let's add DK, monks and DHs.
---
Let's add LFG and LFR
---
Oh and flying mounts, arenas and artifacts!
---
Hit the nail right on the head. 
---
It really isnt the game it used to be. 
---
Alot of people don't understand us when we dump on the modern game. 
---
The thing is we had something great, something that millions and millions of players enjoyed and couldn't get enough. An MMORPG that rewarded you for extensive amounts of time invested into it. It was grindy, and it wasn't perfect. But damn it sure felt worth it. 
---
So many hours burned felt justified when obtaining a certain item, or completing a specific objective. Plus the fact that the servers were these closed communities and everyone knew each other, it felt great because your achievements were not just something for you. But for all others to see, to marvel at, or be jealous of. 
---
Such an intense feeling came from this game in its glory days. Everything has been dulled down, the taste of victory is bitter and hollow. It is not the game we fell in love with.
---
That doesn't mean people cant enjoy it. Some people like it, and blizzard decided to appeal more so to that crowd sadly. 
---
*We aren't upset that people are having fun and we aren't. We are upset that a game we loved was taken away from us to make way for their fun*
---
aaah aah aah yes finally I am going to spray cum all over you!!! mmmmh mmmh mmhm mmmhmmmh yeah keep going, yeah play with my balls hhhmmmmmmmm oh yeah that feels good mmm mmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Ah ahhhhhh a aaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmm woa woa woa too fast if you keep going like that im going to cu- oh oh ohoho aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
---
There might be some market manipulation profits to be had too :)  Things'll be scarce for a bit.
---
You and me both man, I was older when Vanilla released than the average current age of players on that list now.   My age line is about as flat as my heart rate LOL

I disagree. I haven’t run dungeons recently, but from everything I’ve seen, they moved encounter difficulty away from class mechanics and toward boss mechanics. While Golemagg or Executus might be “simple” encounters by today’s standards, playing a rogue or warrior was MUCH more involved. For one thing, threat was actually something you had to pay attention to; tanks poured every drop of Rage into maximizing their threat output and DPS had to install Omen to make sure they didn’t pull hate. Vanish and Feign Death were used on cooldown to make sure you could pour on the damage without restraint (and heaven help you if the boss resisted).
---
Now, tanks have all of 6-8 threat buttons to hit; DPS have only slightly more.
---
My hometown had midnight releases up until and including MoP, for cata/mop one of the cashiers at the local electronics store had even gotten permission to host a small lan, and the attendees basically sat from like 5-6 PM on their PCs ready to go and were first in line for the boxed games if they wanted them. I bought all my copies there until WoD where I was simply too lazy and slept in so I was freshly rested close to midnight xD
---
If they had WoW Tokens on the AH as solely a gold sink (you buy them with gold, the gold vanishes, you get game time - there is no transference of gold at all it literally gets deleted from the server) that would be ok imo. It's a shared sub, so if people want to spend their classic gold on game time, let them. 
---
As long as the gold doesn't go from person A to person B, it's not that bad.
---
Everyone has said it.
---
Well part of the whole way tokens work is that by buying and selling them the market determines the price.  Which is why I'm not at all worried if they do add tokens.
---
The token price in retail is so bloated right now because of how devalued gold is.  In classic that won't be the case, it's not like people are going to have thousands of gold to spend on tokens, you think a lot of people are going to be jumping at paying 20$ for like 5 gold?
---
I dont like this, simply because I think the best natural community will be built without tokens.
---
If tokens are introduced people will farm gold for them instead of doing other worthwhile activities ingame. Be it farm rep for some faction or farmong for a drop or even consumes for raiding.
---
The world will feel more organic with people  doing the most obscure things instead of just farming gold.
---
And who gave you the authority to decide what is considered a "measly" change?
---
I see a lot of people claiming that balancing classes or adding dual specs won't have a major impact on the game.
---
Should we add those changes as well, since classic won't be the same as vanilla?
---
If you start night elf zones it's definitely do-able.
---
Are you trolling? It was staged wow humor the guild had made for Warcraftmovies
---
It's braindead content with embarrassing, irredeemable writing; 99% of players are there for the welfare epics. If LFR stopped dropping gear today, it'd be completely deserted tomorrow. And "gatekeeping?" Seriously...? And then you immediately accuse someone of acting entitled, lmao. scrape together some self-awareness you stooge
---
For the sake of less frustration for the warlock player, I would suggest any class that is also slow.  Priest, paladin, warlock, warrior.
---
For the sake of synergy, literally anything will work with a warlock, but I think warrior/rogue would be the worst.
---
Jesus dude, Your entire post history screams “Edgy Insecure Clown.”
---
Most people dident know it existed. Including myself
---
Depends on your definition of feasible and how bad you want it. Fast? Cheap? Easy? Not annoying as all hell? No. Doable? Absolutely!
---
nochanges is just a philosophy to keep classic as true to the original as possible.  Implementing ideas like the wow token could lead to a slippery slope (as evidenced by actiblizz's actions in the past) in addition to fucking up the economy.  People will walk if they do that and the chances of this project being successful are way lower.
---
Same thing with runescape and WoW for me, only a few games were able to suck me in to the point where, when my PC in 2005 was restarting every 5 minutes, I'd still rush to log into RS to get maybe 2 mins of gameplay in before it died again.  I started in mid TBC and didn't even hit max until WotLK was out but man I was hooked.  The world was just so large and mysterious to me.  
---
I can't wait to hop back in!
---
These are pretty professional. Amazing job.
---
Tbh i don't see it staying relevant that long with so many private servers if it's gonna cost the same $15/month.  I personally wouldn't pay for it and that's coming from someone who considers WoW classic-BC the best MMO(s) of all time.
---
It's doable for sure. Warlocks don't need to go back to the class trainer every two levels. Human racial also gives you 10% more rep. 
---
Also consider that there won't be enough quests in neither Darkshore nor Westfall to carry you through the levels. So you could just as well do Darkshore + Westfall to 20 and then Ashenvale + Duskwood/Wetlands to 30 and so on. If the cloth rep quest is available at launch then you can get exalted with turnins instead of questing.
---
Swap holy around 55 and being your healing journey in dungeons
---
It's not really the best of jokes and the amount of farm compared to work/value is quite overshot.
---
[PreBIS](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12cca6a80be4965f706a27dd61b6ee026d004e0879979e4d22bb9e49460b56c95f1a0e1f1a064f68afe803167296745587ef643e61c70abce7cb7bbe6c2fd11902a476185814b0e627f92447306643bebf52c99fa1c5e907c9620a1821c760c9c5c13c10c5641e349fa6bd4d23ed1209ce78158b17a8cfb090fb642e5f7a7d76707892575e01041252b0dc5418c9274e70e68bedce2fda1a9595ae4e201dcd6252f8dd8aa65) is common, easy to get spellgear.
---
And T2 should have spelladin priority, since it's pretty much BIS forever.
---
I allready said it that i like this idea very mutch.
---
Not because i want to use it, because it will take gold out of the eco system.
---
And ppl forget, privat servers did nerf alot of gold farming spots to stabelize the econemy, it would be a way for blizzard to maybe fix the econemy without changes in the game itself.
---
Sadly i bet there wont be any solutions for that and the easy knowledge we  have today will absoluty destroy the econemy in retail classic.
---
And it will prevent ppl semi legal token trading, i can see that becoming a problem until blizzard dos something against it, because what keeps me from trading 500g in classic for 150k Gold in bfa, to the guy can buy token for it.
---
This is great. Did you ever manage to clear BWL?
---
I was hoping to do the same but realized the whole trainer issue too
---
...but it's called a PvP server.
---
Hey, as long as you're Alliance I'm happy to play with you too ;)
---
Wtf lol, 
---
Okay moron, let me explain this to you in simple terms:
---
Dual spec, Class Balancing = GAMEPLAY 
---
WoW Token = NON-GAMEPLAY.
---
No. That will artificially influence server economy.
---
Jesus Christ its horrible.....More please
---
That's also a great way to get scammed.  Trade on retail and the guy never shows up to do the second half of the transaction on classic.
---
Now you use punctuation and everything! :D
---
I also believe in ganking level 51 mages from behind a tree
---
Your videos were a fucking blast back in the day dude. I never got more than lok/rhok and a few pieces of T2 before I traded in my hunter, but I remember watching your videos, one of the few content creators back then that didn’t take themselves all to serious and managed to make videos that were also fun. 
---
You going hunter again this time around?
---
Really tired of reading this. The ability to sell a token for gold has absolutely zero impact on the economy of a server. No gold is created or destroyed in either the purchase or sale of a token. It is not a gold faucet. It is simply already existing gold changing hands.
---
Preserving the classic experiance means, there is no next phase!
---
I know a pserver running X+ years, 200-300 concurrent players per faction on peak times, 2 guilds, one RP, one not. The later doing "random naxx runs 6/15" on a weekly schedule. Alts forming groups for the whole 1-60 content. Others have "zimtschnecken"!
---
Give classic enough time for the long shot. Let the 50% experiance all content without introducing lfr and normal mode. And let the other 50% do their fishing, their everlasting AV, their bragging in major cities, their RP events, their mindless grind in the wilds..
---
(^^)
---
Thank you :)
---
It can offer something the private servers can’t. Persistence and population. Not worrying about hitting 60 and your character getting wiped because your private server got too big and got hit with a shutdown notice is huge. It’s why I gave up on private servers. 
---
I think it will stay relevant for quite awhile. Hopefully they don’t create too many servers for the rush and end up with a bunch of dead realms once the 1 month nostalgia junkies quit. We shall see I guess. Personally, I hope it holds me over until crowfall or Camelot can fill the gap
---
It's an interesting proposal but it'll never happen because they would have to change how the token infrastructure works, that's a huge cost with no returns.
---
They want more people on retail, not less, and pushing people to grind retail to pay subs with gold is a way to boost their numbers, that's also why the sub is shared.
---
Fury is the go to PvE spec but I don't like it personally, if you are very desperate for some 2H action then 2H Fury is viable as well but people mostly dual wield in it. Very gear dependent as well but an absolute beast once geared.
---
Arms is the go to PvP spec, it's not as good in PvE sadly but it's not useless. Also very gear dependent but once decently geared you scaling will shot through the roof. The main problem is Mortal Strike knocking off important debuffs so they are mostly forbidden in raids, at least by strict min-maxers. Nonetheless, I enjoy this specs the most.
---
Protection is the obvious tank specs. You can off tank in Arms or Fury but as a main thank forget those.
---
It’s some kind of weird action game. Has almost no RPG elements anymore and has lost many of the MMO elements with shit like sharding, phasing, cross realm, lfr, etc
---
Good Mages who are AoE leveling are way faster then Warlocks are and can even keep up with top Hunters!
---
BUT BUT FRONSTABBING AND SITTING DOWN!!1111
---
Pservers are a way better representation of classic than vanilla ever was. Vanilla didn't have players theorycraft everything in advance, vanilla didn't start with 1.12. Basically all the experience pre 1.12 is invalid because 1.12 is a completely different game, and the playerbase that plays pserver and classic is the same, but it's completely different to the playerbase of vanilla.
---
Die in hell
---
No thanks.
---
More time than this post deserved.
---
That's a very condescending way to look at it. Not everything needs to be hyper competitive Esporty.
---
The only way for you to know if it will be worth it is for you to put in the work and then get the reward
---
Up/down goes underused for mouse binds, Imo. That's a good call.
---
&gt; From there on you can level without train for long time, and the trip from darkshore to IF isn't that long. 
---
This, just get the flight path otw over and you should be more than fine even if you want to go back a bunch.
---
No need to get butthurt. go take your meds and calm down please.
---
r/bestof
---
Let's hope they stick to that. They haven't actually been that specific when it comes to timeframe or what exactly counts as "early zones".
---
You see. 
---
This is the stuff that makes me want to roll a Warrior.
---
But then i remember the suffering of leveling a Warrior.
---
To be fair, posting in online forums is probably more fulfilling than anything they could be doing in BfA.
---
Yes, glitches and bugs means that the game is changed. Also since we have raid loot trading, we also better add the whole shop and death knights. 
---
Stop clinging to straws to boost your non-sense. 
---
"Measly" Go tell the other 1 million people about that, will you? All of them have "measly" changes in mind.
---
I would not take into account what your friend is playing at all. Play what is interesting to you. Whatever that is, it'll work. You have to invest so much time in the character and you wont always play together. You'll regret choosing something just because it's the most efficient pair.
---
&gt; But we recognize that a cohesive world is critical to WoW Classic and are committed to bringing that to you.
---
Is especially this among several other sentences here not suggesting they won't shard in the long run?
---
I think having a lower skill floor mmo really brings everyone out. Part of wows drop off has to do with cata raising the skill floor so so many casual people stopped having fun. It's very much an action game now.
---
 **&lt;fit&gt; US Horde PVP  is actively seeking players for Classic!** 
---
 **About Us**: Our leadership consists of players who have cleared vanilla content while it was current content and perennial Cutting Edge Mythic raiding experience in retail.  We intend to raid on a relatively light schedule while maintaining a competitive pace and rank on our server. We are on the lookout for players with a similar mentality to bolster our roster going into Classic. Looking for players that enjoy playing the game beyond just logging on for raids.  
---
**Recruitment**: Currently open to all classes and appropriate specializations.   
---
**What we are looking for**: Since we're a  2 day raiding guild we expect raiders to use their time in raiding efficiently. This means being inside the instance, buffed, and ready to pull at 8pm with any consumables required for your role.  Alts will not be mandatory.  
---
**Loot &amp; Schedule Days**: Saturday &amp; Sunday  Hours 8-11 EST.  
---
&lt;fit&gt; will use a DKP based system 
---
Occasional 20 man raids on off nights based on reset schedules.  We're also always looking for social members that want to have a fun time experiencing classic with us!

I think so? At least near the end. 
---
You described my end of middle school raiding molten core playlist haha
---
I remember filming pvp footage on my NE rogue in undercity bumping the first track on still searching. Thought I was so edgy wearing full T2, stun locking whatever poor soul went down the ally I was waiting in.
---
It's crazy that everyone in that photo has already passed away from old age
---
I played ashran nonstop during WoD, as I didn't raid that expansion... yeah, I have half memories of good PVP fun, and the other half was a laggy mess, usually when the opposing raid appeared and was rushing towards our group.
---
Thrown are limited by ammo (weren't unlimited until wrath), while enchanted thrown weren't out until cata.
---
Seems like it would be overly complicated, I mean perhaps at some point but right off the bat in vanilla, people are not exactly thinking about, oh boy I can't wait to save up enough gold to buy game time. Maybe wait until wrath or something.
---
Druids have much higher burst TPS than any warrior due to Gnome Pummeler that's dropping in Gnomeregan :)
---
Every fight where guilds want to go ALL OUT from second 1 is a druids job. That holds true for equal gear levels though. Druids fall off due to less available gear during BWL. But any druid will out TPS a warrior in blue gear during MC. Every single fight.
---
There are going to be few quests you'll skip because you don't want the reward or focus different quests for rewards, your gonna need every bit of xp you can get to avoid a lot of grinding
---
I mean, it clearly was a great joke. Given we are discussing it 14 years later, and in looking at just a few of the reposted videos we see 8 million, 12 million and 43 million views.
---
Glad to see young people are still fucking up their lives these days.
---
So what you're saying is it's to protect the world from devastation?
---
Stop it, you should know most redditors don't have their priorities straight ;)
---
I approve this - this is exactly how it works.. we all should refresh /r/classicwow as much as we can.
---
I think you’re kind’ve painting with too broad a brush here. 
---
Like you said - if LFR/Normal/Heroic didn’t exist, you wouldn’t get to see the content without grinding dungeons for very specific pieces of gear, just like in Vanilla. 
---
The Devs added watered down game modes so that players who aren’t good at RPGs can follow the story, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play it as an RPG
---
Oh, so non-gameplay changes are OK then?
---
Could you show me the petition that everyone has signed in agreement with that?
---
Or is it just you who has the authority to decide what is ok and not ok?
---
In general, the HD remaster is great. Really cleans the game up visually and includes some nice features that weren't in the original. However, the PC version is better than the Switch one because it allows you to use Turbo Mode for grinding (2x and 4x speeds).
---
Yeah I'm 20 years old, I just levelled characters to 20 and gave up to level more since it became too hard.
---
I’m just gonna copy paste to you what I told the other whiner. 
---
&gt; Okay moron, let me explain this to you in simple terms:
---
&gt; Dual spec, deathknights Class Balancing = GAMEPLAY 
---
&gt; Choosing to buy stuff with your gold WoW like a Token = NON-GAMEPLAY.
---
Hush, we ought not to speak of it.
---
in terms of gp/hr potential you can find a ratio that fits that.  
---
same way rs3 and osrs did it
---
Reddit does it as a step to to not notify people they have been banned. Instead of outright banning you, (which would result in the banned person making a new account) they simply stop making anything you post visible to other people. This is mainly used so spam bots have a harder time detecting that they have been banned, but people also get shadow banned as well.
---
I'd recommend try to open the video from the desktop browser.
---
How’d you know?
---
My approval of classic, low key, hangs on the music change spot in onyxias lair. There is a spot before you get to the trash in ones lair where the music changes from that really drum heavy dungeon music to the brass heavy and upbeat one. You can strafe over it and continuously flip the song. 
---
15 year old me found this hilarious. 30 year old me will find it hilarious.
---
Mind blast causes double threat. But i agree with everything else you said.
---
It would be easy for them since WoW now is basically a remastered version of classic
---
Those are absent in the game?
---
What got you so hyped yesterday?  Just curious :p
---
So we're talking about this users post of:
---
**Blizz specifically said it would be just starting zones for a limited amount of time**
---
You're talking about how they are **suggesting** not sharding in the long run. My comment from earlier is:
---
**Exactly - suggesting they will make an effort to have it as starting zones and temporary is not in the same conceptual universe as stating it is starting zones and temporary.**
---
They have never said they won't, they just pinky-promise super-duper swear they'll like totally try and all.
---
I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
SSD = Solid State Disk/Drive.
---
You know how USB Sticks used to be a lot faster than harddrives? Imagine a harddrive made out of the thing USB sticks are made of.
---
This is obviously a simplified explaination, but it still holds up. SSDs are harddisks made out of NAND memory in silicon chips. Those can be read and written to much **much** faster than the magnetic discs in traditional HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Loading times are much shorter in most games if they are installed on SSDs. Your computer boots much faster. Win10 basically requires you to install it onto an SSD (still works with HDDs, but it's a worse experience).
---
You can read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive
---
Glad you enjoyed it! Josh is a good interviewer.
---
Wrong. Taurens can ride kodos and wolves. They can't ride raptors/UD mounts though, outside of the ZG raptor and the Baron's Deathcharger.
---
I don't see why buying game time with gold is an issue, tbh. If you're farming gold with nothing to spend it on, I don't see a problem.
---
"It wasn't in Vanilla" - yes, the monthly cost was. Payment option isn't a "Vanilla" thing, it's a BNet thing. Wether you farm in retail since it's the same subscription or Classic is all the same. I'd rather have people farming in Vanilla than classic. Gathering mats while out in public so we can fight or I can come to their aid or them mine than have them play retail to farm G to buy game time. People farmed gold all the time for no other reason than to farm gold. 
---
Buying GOLD or ITEMS with tokens in Vanilla is a hard no.
---
Reddit does it as a step to to not notify people they have been banned. Instead of outright banning you, (which would result in the banned person making a new account) they simply stop making anything you post visible to other people. This is mainly used so spam bots have a harder time detecting that they have been banned, but people also get shadowbanned as well. As of the time I am posting this, there are 26 comments, but if you count them all there are only 25. There is an invisible comment in this thread that none of us can see. That person was shadowbanned.
---
There are people in 2019 that don’t know it was staged and scripted? Next you’re gonna tell me you think the WWE isn’t scripted too.
---
Nice. That's good to know, as I plan on rolling a tank druid until at least level 60. I've got another friend rolling arms warrior to level 60 and respeccing prot at 60, who will likely be our guild main tank, and I'll be the guild off tank and we'll kit out some other warriors/druids as needed to fill in the remaining sometimes tank duties. 
---
I didn't play druid much back in vanilla and when I did it was as a healer.... I also haven't done any theory crafting on the subject aside from `More armor = better` So that's something to consider.
---
I quit because of dailies. So, yeah.
---
4 stre, 4 stam leather belt.. ahhh ohh ahhh
---
Sounds like Diablo
---
Steps to controll wow addiction.
---
- get a girlfriend (Make sure she dont like videogames)
---
- Knock her up
---
- Discuss millions of times of gaming hours
---
- Be forced to having 4hrs a day time to play
---
- write ur sad story on reddit
---
- profit?
---
Really? I have all my original boxes for blizzard and other games but I don’t think they are worth jack.
---
That's certainly not the reaction, let alone self awareness I was expecting, cheers! I'm very aware of my hostility, which I guess you can argue about whether or not it's completely uncalled for or not. Anyway, have a nice day fuckface
---
thanks for info!
---
Do I spend all of my free time being hyped?   Am I posting this from the lunch room at my workplace?      Maybe I am too hyped.   I just want  to love wow again.
---
A sealed unused Vanilla CE with an available key is worth thousands.
---
Unfortunately it's probably going to be August.
---
TF was also used in TBC until they nerfed the threat.
---
"Hurr hurr let's add a P2W element to Classic it won't affect anyone's gameplay"
---
Is there a phase zero, or will MC/Ony be open day 1?
---
Oh. TIL.
---
Easy solution? Make people have to grind gold like that did in Vanilla, you fuckin moron
---
The release date announcement is going to be August?
---
Lucky for you that your kids are probably teenagers and don’t like hanging out with you!
---
More WoW play time!
---
This is such hyperbole. There is not a single interaction like this on pservers. More than likely the pservers hero will be more prepared than you because he has been playing a very accurate emulator for the past 5 years.
---
Oh shit. I misread the post. My bad.
---
In the 20 years or so I've been playing video games, I've gone through most levels of casual through hardcore playstyle. To me, it's a matter of what I, as a casual and hardcore player, have found fulfillment in. I agree with the sentiment of the people calling vanilla more casual than BFA, but I don't think they're explaining what they mean very well. 
---
As a casual player, I have wanted to experience new things, and even though I don't want to commit the time to play at the highest level, I want to get the most out of what I've got. there's generally an end-goal I want to work towards - like killing a specific raid boss. When I was a more hardcore player, there was no end-goal - it was an ongoing goal to get better.
---
I played casually in Burning Crusade and Legion, and of the two, I certainly got more fulfillment out of Burning Crusade. Even though I was well behind the progression raiders, I could experience and *progress through* content. In the downtime of not being in a guild, I could also grind out honor and get useful upgrades that gave me a leg up in some capacity over even experienced raiders. These experiences were fulfilling because even though I was never going to be particularly good, having a challenge and working towards seeing the next raid was cool and inviting.
---
Legion - even though it had tons of "casual" mechanics like raid finder, titanforged world quest epics, and catch-ups - was an unfulfilling hamster wheel. As a casual player, I could hit max level, join a raid finder group for Antorus, and then I'd seen everything. There was no goal to work towards. I *could* farm world quests for the next year, but why? I *could* try to do the raid on normal difficulty, but why? I'd already seen the whole raid, and the only thing that better gear would let me do is try the raid *again* on another difficulty. Mythic+ dungeons take it even further - at least with raids there is a highest difficulty. None of this makes a casual player want to keep playing the game.
---
As a hardcore player, on the other hand, I probably would have loved Legion and BFA - there's an infinitely tall ladder to climb just to show how high you can climb it. The only thing that matters is how many people are below you on that ladder and how few are above you - very little about the ladder itself is important.
---
I've used this type of service in the past in other games to transfer gold between servers.   I've never been scammed.  Usually it's not some rando, but an established, known trader.    Any one worth trusting will also be willing to dual log accounts, so you can do the trade simultaneously if you desire.
---
Yeah there's a new thread with that idea, but they would have to change how the token infrastructure works, huge cost with no returns, not gonna happen.
---
While I do not agree with tokens being purchasable in classic, I think this would be a fairly easy problem to solve. Last I played token prices were variable, likely tied to auction house trends, inflation, volume of gold currently in player hands across the server(s), etc. I think making an exchange rate would be one of the simpler problems to overcome.
---
Poor mama
---
I'll take the field
---
We're betting on a date to get another date. How desperate are we? 
---
Im guessing we'll get a date by mid June, for August... Yep... I'm desperate as well.
---
&gt;eady had the experience of nerding through cl
---
Haha well good luck, I have cleared everything with my wife so that sides of things is ok I think haha. But yea if I'm home i will be watching the 3 yr old so unless i can get her playing also ....
---
You convinced me.
---
I know it's a joke.
---
I'm fully aware.
---
I'm just saying it's not really that funny and deserve all the fame
---
Weird how time passes for everyone at the same rate 🤔
---
Honestly I thought I wouldn’t enjoy classic and I know  bringing up a pserv is wrong but I played on one and had the best time in wow I have ever had in a long time. The community, meeting people as you go, and the overall character progression is what makes it so fun imo. I went in thinking I would be bored.
---
The WWE is just as stupid. 🤷‍♂️
---
Release date announced June 5th
---
Well, to be fair, I am basing this off of the concept that people utilizing all 4 drops are in a guild that is clearing everything to have access to all 4 drops. When it comes down to it, if you're clearing out KT, then Atiesh becomes literally just a handful of weeks for shards. It doesn't rely on stupid low drop chances. I saw guilds on my server in Vanilla get one binding, and by the time they were halfway through Naxx working on Military Wing, they still hadn't seen the second binding. I, myself? Took me 54 weeks for ONE of the bindings alone. I'm just saying. That's pretty damn weak sauce right there.
---
Exactly why I quit private servers and am waiting. Was so much time and effort for nothing, and I wasn't even 60
---
Hahaha, I always loved the level 51 mage joke -- I'm so happy people remember it!
---
Yes, a lot of people actually hated my videos I because they took them so seriously. XD
---
I was strongly debating hunter vs rogue, but I think I will try rogue for a fresh experience this time around! How about you??
---
I mean I gotta admit that I never got as far as naxx or even aq and didn't play much on private vanilla servers. But generally, like you already hinted at, the complexity of vanilla is more on the theorycrafting side of things than on the mechanical. Which I do take over the current overall gamestate any day of the week. Although I do prefer tbc and wotlk gameplay wise. You are totally right to argue against that claim in a vacuum, however I think most of the time it's used as an exaggeration in comparison to later versions of the game, or it's people just hating on vanilla for the sake of it

$20 on August 23

 **&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.

For release date not an announcement lol
---
I used to do this with an Alienware laptop when I was younger. Would you want to play OW with that setup? prolly not. But it would not be too much input lag for wow.
---
Not to mention you had to farm a whole set of fire resistant armor just to survive parts of the MC.  I miss that element as well.
---
depends if classic allows spell queueing, if not like in vanilla then you need mousewheel to spam your casts to minimize downtime. must use for shadowbolt then.
---
Oh yea, in vanilla we cleared all content except for Naxx (I think we were held up on 4 horsemen, and we never got the C'thun kill either).
---
How have the mods not banned you yet? All you do is get hostile in every thread in this sub. 
---
u/Soupasoka, take this kobold away please.
---
Who?
---
Which was such a shame, since TBC knocked class design out of the park. You could bring the player, and the class. Plus, they made 10 man content that was easy, Kara, and pretty hard, ZA, to accommodate the casual playerbase. There was no need for 4 difficulty modes to satisfy everybody.
---
Must have missed the “fuck off” and “go die” comments above, eh?
---
Thank god I’m not old (29)!
---
I'm more of a visual person and in prepping for Classic I wanted a quick way to see what level my skills are available. Took a bit but happy with the results. I'll probably print up the sheet too because I like physical paper better than stuff on the screen.
---
I'm welcome to fix any mistakes I made, so let me know. 
---
I made it in Google Slides and also with GIMP to edit/create the icons.

Technically you go to hell *after* dying.

I've only bought gold a few times and they were all during MoP. Even back then I just got an in game mail basically asking me to "please stop buying gold, we're not gonna ban you but please stop". Only bought gold 1 more time after that. So they definitely are harder on the sellers than the players.
---
Which would remove gold from the Classic server economy. That seems silly.
---
Thats what he means unfortunately.
---
I don't want to see tokens in classic, either, but if you think you're getting classic because a bunch of neckbeards on the internet signed a petition you're naive.
---
And do you go around starting zones as a level 60 stomping level 1 mobs? It is called pve after all.
---
Weren't there some warlocks in a house at the back of ratchett, cant remember if that was vanilla or later?
---
I had to put mine in last year. How do you think I feel

You're way overestimating the skill of the average gamer &amp; the sheer number of folks who will be new to the endgame. I played on multiple vanilla pservers in the last few years. My experience was: unless you're in the top-end guilds you will no doubt have a handful of individuals in your raids who are single-handedly responsible for a wipe. Suffice to say, that plenty of people still don't know the basic mechanics of MC or ZG, &amp; even if they do, they can still fuck up &amp; struggle from time to time, or just be underperforming on DPS meters. The # of folks who were hardcore raiders back in OG vanilla will not be the same population of people looking to maintain that same schedule in 2019.
---
RE: the toxicity, it's going to vary by server. No doubt the larger communities with a greater number of streamers will be more prone to toxicity. Don't like that environment, it's quite easy to simply reroll and relocate before you're even sniffing max level.
---
Its like the mixing today is a lot more muted, so much so you can barely hear your own footsteps whilst in vanilla you could hear different footsteps depending on the ground
---
Seguren made these for all classes
---
Well, I have almost completely lost faith in AAA studios and there are literally no upcoming games that have my interest. I've hopped between the other big MMO's, like most others have, and find myself unable to scratch the itch that WoW left me with. (Warframe and FF14 are enjoyable enough) 
---
I really don't know why but I just happened to stumble upon a YT video about Classic and the feeling of excitement/nostalgia was out of this world. 
---
While I am beyond disappointed with Blizzard-Activision and various other AAA studios, Classic represents everything I loved about oldschool gaming. It's a chance to go back to the roots of what made WoW the greatest gaming experience of all time. For the first time in a long time we all get to feel like kids on Christmas morning.
---
Why is Shadowmeld so great though? It seems nice, but I don't understand why it would be OP.
---
Expectation : level to 60 and do some raids hopefully see 40man max.
---
Reality: get tired of organizing my evenings around a raid schedule and just level a bunch of alts.
---
Just chill out. We have been waiting for 549 days now (since WoW Classic was announced). Two more months won't kill us.
---
Hey buddy thanks for this!
---
We won't know anything until they have decided on when 8m2 will drop.  The release will revolve around retail content release.
---
But then you get no PvP. Do you understand that some people love PvP but only when it's fair.
---
I plan to sell as I go. Just have a macro with "I can make X bags. Your mats or my mats + a fee, Tips appreciated!"
---
Is that you joe?
---
If it allows for someone who is less well off financially in real life to continue playing this game for free I don't see an issue with it. I have a feeling not many people would use it so the economy would not be affected much.
---
I would suggest you to play Warlock ... fun to lvl ... strong in pve and scales very well in end game ... they are also good at pvp ... shadow magic and pets ... you named it :) ... go for it !! ... 
---
Paladin only if you are 100% sure you wanne heal and endure the pain of leveling ... if you do Paladins are OP in pve ... but the pain ... pppaaaiiinnnn :P
---
Actually one is slightly larger than the other for most guys
---
If you get to Runecloth Bags in like day 2 you could make some serious mount money.
---
You’re right! The one from Thrall. I’ll have to add that.
---
My vote is paladin. I'm specifically playing alliance because I'm duo leveling with a warlock. 
---
https://youtu.be/t_rHqqYnh18?t=1637
---
This does a great job explaining it. Warlock has infinite mana, paladin has no downtime unlike priest, paladin can tank and you can aoe. Both get free mounts. Weve also been practicing it in prep for launch. It is fantastic.
---
Absolutely!  TBC definitely introduced the beginnings of some things that would eventually be (in hindsight) awful additions, but for the most part I consider it peak WoW, largely due to class balance.
---
Announced: 7/22/2019  
---
Release: 9/16/2019  
---
"Summer"
---
It's a moot point. The change as outlined by OP would trash BFA server economies even more. It definitely would affect the game, just on a BFA server instead.
---
As a WOW and destiny player THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I think they calling the community toxic is a lazy cop out and ignores the fact that each of us are individually responsible not only our own contributions, but for crafting our image of the community. It becomes even more important that we block people, we ignore people, we consider what Guild we want to join, and if we run a guild we be more Discerning about who we invite.
---
I'm sure there will be plenty of Guild on classic who will be using automatic invite add-ons, and they just want to be a giant blob of people that's their prerogative. But when there is not a cross server feature, the server Community will become even more important. People who do bad things will get reputations and those reputations will follow them.
---
The gameplay is the gameplay and that will never change. What we have control over is our personal mindset.
---
They are bottom tier dps in 5 man dungeons.
---
They do half the dps as a real dps class, have no aoe, pull tons of threat and don't have a reliable cc except for shackle undead. They also have no dps cooldowns to pop when things get rough.
---
George RR martin has no idea where to take the story next, change my mind
---
Don’t see him dying. Source?
---
Oh I feel that.  I don't play much games anymore because they don't hold my attention like WoW used to.  I still hop around various MMO's for maybe a few days at a time but nothing keeps my hooked.  
---
Come summer though, I'm gonna be hopping on before and after work on a daily basis, I know this for sure lol.
---
Classic game mechanics would largely require them to be functioning community members, though, so I'm not entirely sure that would be such a problem.
---
There's dozens of us. Dozens!!!!
---
I would REALLY like to see this. With a distance marker etc...not sure how easy it would be to create and figure out the exact distances...unless its just a simple whichever is closer. 
---
I am gonna search around for this though.
---
Where’s the sword of a thousand truths?
---
Some people definitely are. It sounds like some are going through a mid life crisis, but worse, and think that classic will cure all that ails them.
---
Okay I'll give you an honest answer. At some point people will have gold and nothing to spend it on. Which is fine. They'll have lots of gold and therefore be less motivated to go out and farm stuff in order to make more gold. Which means there will be less competition for resources. If you open up the purchase of tokens, you have lots of people constantly farming for resources to make gold to buy tokens.
---
I don't know how you feel about that but as people are leveling low level alts or new characters/players entering the game and trying to level up their crafting professions, it would be nice if they didn't have to compete with max level characters for resources who are only doing it to essentially farm gold.
---
Oh, and create a lvl 1 that you can mail stuff to so you don't have to run to town all the time. Dont even need to log alt in until you have time to do so.
---
Im going to play a Priest, so I'll be doing Tailoring if I dont decide to stick with Alchemy. So I'll just need to run Stockkades or Scarlet Monastery a few more times for the missing cloth :)
---
Yeah I remember having the same item in a slot for like 25 levels sometimes back in the day, it was such an awesome feeling getting a new one. I have no idea what any of the items on my retail toon are
---
If lvl 1 mobs went and cried on reddit about it I might.
---
Cute attempt at emotional manipulation.
---
59g 40s just to train your level 60 spells
---
It would be a good gold sink in classic, but the exchange rate has to be made up somewhere. You can't turn 500g into 120k on a BFA server, and since that gold can't exchange between player hands, the difference has to be generated out of thin air. The economy would be trashed, and "well it's a bfa server" isn't a good reason for that to happen lol
---
Not if ur on a pvp server
---
Lol k.
---
The cos in cosplay stands for costume, so I think we can still call them costumes...
---
Top 10 vanilla WoW videos that were ahead of their time.
---
Each person gets to decide how they shape part of the community. Yes, there will be elitist groups that have ultra high standards oh, and there was nothing wrong with that. If that makes them happy they can do that. And there will be other groups, other guilds, who are smaller and less focused and we will see them in trade chat asking for pugs to help fill out their raid. There's a fair chance their raid will not get as far as the elite groups raids, and that's just fine. There will be fights over gear. There will be disagreements. There will be a. Of time where people reevaluate how they communicate because they realize they can't just get away with joining groups and saying nothing and face rolling through content the way they did in battle for Azeroth.
---
Folks are going to learn how to communicate again. Battle for Azeroth they were 20 different ways to get gear and progressed when you hit maximum level and much of it you could do on your own. Vanilla is not like that. The endgame content is much more narrow so I plan on taking much more time to meet people and make friends and enjoy the experience.
---
People who choose to race 260 probably already have a guild setup and friends were doing likewise and they want to get to that end content fast. That's cool, that's their idea of fun.
---
is it called a turny because they're keyboard turning?
---
Ever since they announced wow classic I have 0 feelings and emotions but longing. I feel I will develop a tumor or some form of cancer from this feeling then die before it even comes out. #Theburdenofclassic
---
That's not the petition that I'm talking about...
---
It's May. I'm getting worried it isn't actually coming out this summer. Do we have any recent evidence to support it's still coming out this summer and hasn't been pushed back? :/
---
You don’t know Death and Taxes or Swifty but you know Leeroy? My point further proven.
---
Ok this passed 11 seconds of our time waiting, what next
---
Pretty easy actually. Human/Dwarf/NE have so many quests that getting exalted is pretty easy if you just focus their content instead of your own. 
---
A Dwarf getting a Mech Strider is much more annoying as gnomes only have barely enough quests for honored, and the rest comes from Spillover or generic +alliance quest reps (of which there's only a few). Aside for that your only option is cloth turn-ins.

Haha! You too sir. I do agree we shouldn't be so hostile as we all just want to enjoy classic again, and putting down others for enjoying the modern game isn't helpful.
---
I'm not usually so toxic, I promise. Cheers brother.
---
This is interesting. The target market for vanilla at release will be 30-40 years old now. However, the classic population will skew much younger because:
---
* As you get older, life happens. Older players are more likely to have other obligations.
---
* WoW's active subs peaked in 2010. Those players will be 25-35 now.
---
* The game was designed for 15-25 year olds, so it's still going to appeal to those players.
---
Why not just get the winterspring one?
---
... we are?
---
What makes you say that?
---
Riot to Irvine
---
Yes, surely the last 15 years of hardware development won't have a positive impact. A CPU upgrade I did on a home machine double my FPS. But surely we won't have enough CPU cycles for this in 2019.
---
More like 8.poo amirite
---
Definitely engineering. And LW isn’t really all that great. On PServers Devilsaurs camped by guilds anyway so it’s difficult to make use of it, and I don’t believe you get any BIS that requires LW to wear, unlike tailoring gettting Bloodvine. I’d just pick up a gathering profession and engineering and buy your LW pieces you want with the gold
---
&gt; Anyone who PUGed heroics as shaman in TBC will tell you that not having a CC often made getting into groups difficult
---
People love romanticizing about TBC and its heroics but forget that half of them were so hard you needed a specific CC comp or else you couldn't finish them. I'm playing Netherwing as a Spriest right now and feel the pain. DPS shaman are actually still pretty desired since they bring bloodlust.

Why horde gotta run through stv while alliance run through westfall that ain't fair...

If it’s anything like my situation, my friends and I are all looking forward to Classic because we’re too young and didn’t get a chance. My older brother and his friends, on the other hand, don’t give a crap because they played it, raided it, beat it, and really don’t care to go back.
---
1. As a hunter you can wait in stealth in ambush ... near the road ... at a place where you were ganked ... defending a flag in battleground ... to sum it up it gives you better chances to start a fight on your terms 
---
2. You can eat and drink while in shadowmeld ... and also you can feign death + eat + drink + shadowmeld and enemy to hit you needs to use aoe or run near you ... not much but it take some people off guard and gives you 1 maybe 2 ticks of eating drinking ... there are situations when you can even fool let's say frozen enemy into thinking that you are in shadowmeld at the same place when you feign death but in reality you used potion of invisibility to move for few seconds and than eat + drink + shadowmeld ... 
---
3. Shadowmeld + potion of invisibility jumps 
---
4. Hide from elite mobs in dungeons 
---
5. Hide from horde if in not favourable position 
---
6. With cat you can dual ambush from shadows ... pet wait in one spot to bait enemy that he attacked from one side you attack from the other ... great for flag defending in battleground
---
Penn State?
---
Ah yes. Terribly optimised UI. Low fps. Skullflame on a healer. This is the vanilla I remember. Infact, if it was a video of a shaman I could have sworn it was me! Thanks for the nostalgia.
---
On that note: I'm playing pvp mage but can't make up my mind. Wotf is definitely better (I've used escape artist very little on my current lv35 mage) but I really prefer alliance cities/zones. Which frost mage with engineering should I go for? :p
---
Perhaps stop living a breathing for a videogame that isnt out yet. You will get burned out for sure. You are liteally burned out in hype atm. Nothing ever has or ever will live up to the hype, dont ruin ur lives people! Its gonna be a good time though and im there day one when the product is finished and ready.
---
agree, one of the few things that could really ruin the game for me
---
Ive also tried spelladin and it was even worse than waradin in dps charts. 
---
I did outdps mages and locks in raids but they were probably bad while I was busting my ass, popping every CD mana pot and consecration on CD...
---
I’m in the same boat minus I plan to PVP but here’s what I found.
---
Short term leather working seems the best, cool recipes good stuff while leveling of your not rushing and when you hit 60 some of the dragon scale leather working is neat. Leather working doesn’t give you much for things you will keep and use long term just lots of craft able items to fill slots till you get BIS equipment for the release period. (Unless you go tribal for devilsaur set, but if you want this see below for my suggestion*)
---
Engineering provides advantages in the short and long term, short you get access to your gadgets and bombs to help boost DPS and do lots of fun stuff and well the long term is these things scale much farther than your leather working items will.
---
* if you want the devilsaur set I suggest going mining skinning, save mining materials in bank until your ready to pick up engineering as it doesn’t have a ton of advantage while leveling just a time sink away from the race to 60. Skin everything while leveling sell it to genders for extra cash securing your mount gold and when you hit your 50’s kill those decilsaurs! Skin as many as you can to get the price of your set down or get all the leather you need then drop for engineering because at this point after that skinning doesn’t do a lot for you. 
---
I went skinning leather working in vanilla but looking back I didn’t utilize my professions enough and always wished I had engineering for the DPS perks and mining because of how valuable arcane crystals are.
---
TLDR : go skinning mining, drop skinning after you get enough devilsaur skins and pick up engineering because in the long term it far outweighs leatherworking.
---
Yeah that's one of the things I'm hoping for - to get the hardcore base diluted and get a different experience than the private server bis geared skewed distribution.
---
There are a lot less rogues on private serves these days than a few years ago and more mages/hunters. That's my impression anyways.
---
If you want fair PvP, that's what Arenas and BGs were made for. Or the ability to flag yourself as PvP-active.
---
I am 29 and feel old AF. I really want some thigs in life that I could achieve them sooner. Yea I can't wait for classic but real life is kicking me right now in the nuts like a horse.
---
I had a Dell Inspiron 15 "gaming" laptop +24" curved ASUS gaming monitor for several years and had 0 issues running rated BGs with my guild. Never experienced input lag at all using the monitor. I reckon it depends on your hardware.  You get what you pay for.
---
I'm pretty sure on the most recent itemization post you the classic community manager confirmed you won't be able to get the early patch version unarmored mounts...
---
I feel like the social aspects breaking down killed raiding for casual raiders who like a challenge (there aren't many of us it seems?). In other words, back in the day i'd raid with the B team, because I like raids, i'm good at my roles and, most importantly, I usually can't commit to a timeslot each week (much college, such jobs).
---
Current WoW destroyed casual raiding and split the fragments into hardcore raiding and LFR (which isn't even casual, its way beyond that now). So, when I would sub, i'd never be able to find a guild that was interested in raiding but wasn't one of those "ultra hardcore and required item level 9001 before even getting a guild invite" types.
---
Being good at raids was relatively meaningless, only my commitment mattered. Not that you don't need to be good at top level, but you need to commit first and being good only matters later on.
---
Whereas in earlier expansions if you knew how to play well you could raid, just..... less often and you'd progress slower.
---
yes there are variables like RNG and randomness, loot seeds ect. lots of ppl had bad luck, but on the whole id say TF/sulf is a lot easier just based on how many ive seen/how common they are.
---
June announcement for mid August release.
---
Couldn't agree more, may the wait be over soon
---
Arthas/Lich King was disappointing to me. There was so much cheesy build up and then he just..... is defeated. I didn't feel any of it.
---
Also his voice was too raspy. He didn't sound otherworldly or larger than life, just raspy.
---
If only I could find something in real life to motivate me like Classic has
---
I hope the community doesn't keep bitching about resets and how they missed it, and wah wah FRESH.
---
Hope blizzard doesn't cave for that demand, fracturing the players on old servers.
---
Thanks!  
---
I know it's far from realistic. Even at phase 6 it's going to take time to reach absolute BiS.   
---
I have focused on an absolute BiS list only. Composing a "realistic" BiS list would be next to impossible, since realistic has a different definition to everyone! ;)  
---
However, in the links embedded in the class avatars there are plenty of gear to pick from for each class. I recommend everyone who's viewing this to compose their own list of items and consider the actual BiS item to be a bonus.
---
Late summer, either July or August.
---
fuck it dood just do it
---
I cut a clip from one of my videos I made from myself when doing the BlizzCon demo. Is that what you wanted to hear?

I often feel like management/production screw up the story, but there's never a selling reason to get in the way of the art so..... they let the art team do their stuff.
---
Music on the other hand....... I feel like we get so many atmospheric tracks that aren't too memorable, so its almost the same thing? Honestly I can remember like 4 or 5 tracks from ALL OF WOW, and only 1 is in a dungeon/raid (Naxx, the music that plays when you get up to sapphiron, its sooooo heavy and suffocating).
---
Man I love this, thanks for posting!
---
Just happy to be on the very bottom :D
---
Last I checked, no hybrid classes that can heal and dps are actually viable dps towards late game/raiding :/
---
(at least not without both a casual/accepting guild, and putting 200% effort into consumables and testing specs/gear/etc)
---
I roll the laptop next to my gf on the couch most nights (she’s on her phone and her show is on Netflix - compromise).
---
Raid night I’m on the tower however.
---
She does Pilates and other shit so some times were ships in the night.
---
People farming gold to buy tokens is gameplay. It changes where they are and what they are doing.
---
That's what I want to hear. Let's go!
---
I'm typically a lurker, but one of your statements resonated with me so much that I felt the need to comment.
---
I've worked in IT almost 20 years and was an avid tech/PC enthusiast from a very very young age (parents worked out of the home, had a well-built office w/ high power PCs and stellar (ISDN128 boom) internet.
---
I've always spouted the same mantra as your friends, but I'm finally at a point now where I look back and realize **I never fucking upgraded anything on any one of my machines.**
---
I would spend days/weeks agonizing over the perfect PC build, piece by piece, ensuring that I had a 3/5/10 year plan for upgrading parts, all with cost projections.  I realized though that it's almost worse to plan things out that way.  I built my last gaming PC in 2011. It's the one I still use now, and it still has all the same parts with the one exception being a new harddrive.  Games have gotten ridiculously large, and since the prices of harddrives stay constant, with only the capacity increasing, it's a fairly normal upgrade cycle (every 2-3 years I up it 128-256gb).
---
I fully expected to double my memory and SLI/Crossfire my video cards a couple years down the road when the prices went down and the performance requirements of the games I wanted to play went up.  I checked a few years back and came to find that almost all those parts that I was "holding out" for to come down in price actually went up, because there's a limited supply now, and they are no longer being manufactured.
---
Unless you're trying to compare benchmarks on some random site for e-peen points, a well constructed gaming laptop can and will provide just as good of a gaming experience as a tower.
---
/endrant
---
TL;DR: Don't let the appeal of hot-swapping PC parts over time affect your decision to go tower/laptop.  Laptops are very well built now, and in all honesty the only determining factor in my opinion would be the cost difference (it is still **MUCH** cheaper to buy/build a full tower setup vs. a laptop).
---
I believe the average player back in the day, during vanilla, was 28 years old.
---
I wasn't able to go to that event, but I do remember the next morning going to my local Fry's in San Diego, seeing a nice setup with lines and lines of collectors editions and deciding I couldn't settle for less.
---
Thats a heavy picture
---
&gt; Fury is kinda lame until you get hit gear and full talents.
---
If you know what you are talking about you'd know that *2H FURY* isn't lame. So no, saying fury is "kinda lame" is wrong because it can be good.
---
Time to gold earned ratio dude. As a fresh lvl 60 you will not be getting as much gold per hour as is seen in this video because your kill time will be much slower due to not having gear this good.  
---
Simple math man, assuming you are a fresh lvl 60 your kills will be slower = fewer kills per hour = less gold per hour than shown in the video.
---
As soon as they threw the concept of ilvl in my face it just completely broke the immersion for me.  Obviously it’s something there but I don’t understand why they tell the player, let alone display it on every piece of gear.
---
When I did LFR MC we wiped on Corehounds more than I've ever seen an LFR wipe before. I remember I literally took like 6 hours to finish that.
---
It was insane.
---
Also doing the unspeakable thing and having lots of fun doing it. Often times I spend several hours questing with my friends and think: "To think we're gonna do it all over again when Classic launches." and it fills me with great joy.
---
It would add another gold sink that wasn't there before (with OPs idea gold would vanish from Classic and appear in retail), and it would change what a substantial amount of players were doing. People would be grinding gold a lot more in any way they could. They'd be crafting and gathering and playing the auction house.
---
Dude, I think you need to find some other things to enjoy and stop coming to this sub for a while. That doesn't sound healthy.
---
I'm 33... once I crossed that threshold into the 30s, I felt like I died a little inside.
---
awesome, do you still have it?
---
Thanks for the info, it would take more time to plot everything into GDS but it is probably worth doing in future projects.
---
I'd much rather they lower the subscription fee. Alternatively, it is possible to grind in retail and use the tokens to play in classic.
---
aaaaaand THAT is a huge part of why you need community. You guys are absolutely right about efficiency, optimal builds, and player attitudes. That kinda stuff wont matter much if you bond with a guild and go places. Thats what we did back in the vanilla/wrath/tbc days, we can certainly do it again.
---
Its simple really, just find 50-100 people who hate that elitist bullshit, get chatty, dungeon and quest together and you'll be good. We've seen it happen time and time again.
---
agreed
---
it's funny to me that people here want the private server players to get angry at the reality of what classic will be, when it will more than likely be the other way around
---
I was just thinking the same thing looking at that graph
---

---
&gt; Reality: get tired of organizing my evenings around a raid schedule and just level a bunch of alts.
---
I think this will happen to a lot of people. I'm already trying to figure out how to get home at 6, workout, shower, cook, and eat dinner, all before 8 pm. And then not be able to get up for short breaks and do random things on my own time for the next 3 hours.
---
You do realize nobody really cares about your opinion just as much as they don’t care about mine, right?
---
It was always cut. Raid leads felt more comfortable dishing out what was left over after buyers auctioned on everything. There was a better guarantee of money than a flat fee where they would be out gold regardless of how much buyer's bid.
---
No problem! Glad it helped you. With Classic sticking around for a while you will even have the chance to change professions down the line if you change your mind.  All it takes is time and we should have plenty of that!
---
Your sacrifice shall not be in vain.
---
I'm the only guy who can't comfortably use a computer while laying in bed.

The entire m+ system was taken from D3, and so are the daily quests on the map. Retail became a reskinned d3
---
Don't remind me. Thinking about it almost every day. And my birthday is in march. So in 10 months I will be 30...

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
I am currently doing this on a Pserver as gnome warlock. My plan so far has been level in starting area until 6. This gives you the ability to get your level 6 spells. 
---
You can then do the run and won't get too much experience from discovering zones. All the NE quests are green when you get there so xp and rep. 
---
I then went back to IF to train at 10. There is a quest which makes you go to Darn, this is the best time to go back. I then go back to IF every 4 levels. Worked well so far
---
Nice info about the trinket, thanks for sharing dude!
---
Who’s asking it to be? But if reading a guide before a boss fight, or at the very least a list of their abilities is too much, then it’s pretty obvious that people don’t want difficult content or even engaging content, they want to be able to to the fridge during a boss fight while they wand the boss to death. 
---
And that’s okay, but let’s not sugarcoat anything here. People want the social aspect of raiding, not the gameplay.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Dude, Afroman all the way! Every time I listen to it now I'm back in Loch Modan
---
I’ll hold out blind hope for a July 16th release date, which I think is still feasible if there is no beta or a short beta.
---
Release Date Announcement: Tuesday May 14th, 2019. 
---
100%
---
Such a bad excuse you found to dump on this guys video. This gold farm "in particular is extra useless" because he's wearing dungeon t0 gear and the kill times are marginally faster? Find something useful to complain about instead of getting on an anti-youtuber reddit bandwagon.
---
If you can only buy tokens in classic then blizzard wouldn't profit because no one would buy to sell them for gold.
---
I made my mount money off Darksteel Ore. I couldn’t smelt it because of that damned fire elemental, but the stacks of ore sold, and there was only one place in the world you could get it. And anyone else but Ferals needed a party to mine it.
---
I actually think people in this thread have it all wrong. Druid is a great choice for what you describe - they are versatile pvp healers and can tank 5mans as HOTW spec. The weakness of druids as pvp healers comes due to the insane scaling of t3, Hots can't keep up... But as a non raider you aren't going to hit that issue. 
---
Also, as a non raider your gear will be crap compared to others. A poorly geared priest is going to get absolutely lit up in pvp whereas a druid is much less gear dependent due to mobility and stealth.
---
I'd say a paladin is also a good choice for the pvp healing side with lower gear but a druid is a much better fit for the 5man tank role you describe. If you want to heal 5mans pally is a better choice due to having an OOC rez.
---
But you know what. You'll remember their name, you'll speak of them to others, and you and others will ignore and not group with them
---
Before I state this, I'm fine with either way.
---
First off, in Retail if you were to sell a token, in order to receive the gold someone else would have to "purchase" that token on the AH. This is why the price varies, if they were to create the gold out of "thin air" then the amount you receive would stay constant. 
---
Therefore, in Classic it wouldn't ruin the economy -- inflation would not occur. It would instead be an exchange of gold. As if the token was an item that you sold on the AH. 
---
As for the interesting point of buying a token on BFA with gold, converting the token to $15.00 to your bnet account and then purchasing a token on the Classic Server with said $15.00. I don't see an issue. Blizzard is not creating the gold out of "thin air" after all. 
---
It's an exchange of goods.
---
This is unironically exactly what I think happened.
---
Yeah but PvP means you might actually lose and losing isn't fun/doesn't feel good /s
---
Anyway you could make this so you can exclude certain skills if wanting to save cash?
---
That would be great.
---
It would also require them to reach level 60 -- which is a major time commitment.
---
It's not normal in my experience, no. Emerald Dream used to be full of legit RP, though most of it was military themed.
---
I think newer raids are mechanically far superior to anything in classic, but emotionally they are weaker. Getting to fight Onyxia for example involves a significant personal journey to get there and fighting Onyxia is the climax, the pay off of that big story. Getting to fight Jaina is as easy as clicking queue in LFR in BfA. There's no build up, no tension, no pay off just here's the big fight I hope its cool enough for you. Mythic raiding in BfA can give similar feelings, but by the time you run Mythic you've already actually fought Jaina so a great amount of the narrative tension is dispelled.
---
Knowing Blizzard it's going to be a New Year's Day release.
---
Yes! And that person is you!
---
I played on pservers since 2009 (wow was a little expensive for me, parents never wanted to pay for a game). Ibplayed on old feenix and a lot wotlk servers (can't remember the names tho). They were almost all high rates server bcs scripting wasnt so good. Then nost came. And that is the only server where I actually leveled until lvl 60, had a blast and when the server closed I got a burnout. So much time wasted for nothing. Then I just lost the will for private servers. Waiting for classic and then I can play in peace.
---
How does that prove your point? What have they done to earn fame?
---
Classic is going to much closer to current pservers than to 1.1 vanilla launch.
---
These spell costs are incorrect. These are all the spell costs for Rogues.
---
you will have to buy/farm/learn the recipe again.
---
You didn't have to split it so much
---

---
Tailoring is worth it as a clothie, tailoring has patterns that are best in slot for 5, 10 or more levels. 
---
Blacksmithing, I never feel compelled to craft stuff as I level my warriors. But with a warrior, if you tank, groups are instant, and if I’m tanking, I’m not having paladins of other warriors in the group, so loot isn’t a problem. Oh and eww paladins. 
---
I’ve not leveled the leatherworking classes in some time.
---
Big Brain
---
Inertia. If shards were the orginal "solution" to server crowding, you get into the mindset that because things are sharded, you only have to worry about x number of players at a time and these types of assumptions creep into decision making and programming.
---
Generally, anyone you meet preaching on such and such feature having to be just like Classic will be gone from the servers in less than two weeks.  Pretty much, they have an idea in their heads that they, and only they, are going to know about some feature, tactic, or whatnot that is going to let them be on the "Haves" this time, instead of the "Have-Nots" they have been their whole life.  Even on the pservers, they run across them... one guy had a epic meltdown because he couldn't exploit glitch through a wall in WSG that had existed in Classic.  But, it is hardly a single case study.
---
If you talk to people that in general want to play without having all the systems piled upon expansion systems mess that is current, you might get them to stick with it.  However, do know, LBRS gets boring faster than getting the key to UBRS.  No Dual Spec means a huge shortage of support... and having to have 300g in consumables to raid burns out everything but the uberguilder in record time.
---
https://imgur.com/zIBnOCB
---
Sure do. So glad younger me made that decision way back then, especially since money was so much harder to come by at the time.
---
It's been the only place to get that vanilla fix for 12 years. It's not weird. Although I've hardly played them myself, and won't at all now that we get official classic servers.
---
I didn't realise OP required phase 1 items. Must have missed that bit.
---
It's like they are envious or something that they missed out on a very blizzlike vanilla experience. When the reality is that these servers are still available, and extremely accessable. Nobody is claiming that pservers are 100%, and no one denies they get some things wrong, but a lot of what pservers do is accurate emulation.
---
There is actually an argument against this gearscore is everything observation at least specifically for BfA. For franchised players the extremely polarizing nature of some Azerite traits can cause a lower ilevel to provide higher dps. Enfranchised players then have some argument against this idea.
---
That said, everyone is aware of and accepts that the design goal is to make the big number the only thing that matters so its not really a relevant take from a design perspective.

July is early summer.

---
this is something I find hilarious about it, somehow Blizzard has managed to dupe people into paying 15$ a month for less content than the Destiny devs release for 20$ as a DLC once every five or six months. Paying 15$ a month for Vanilla WoW made sense, you had an unbelievable amount of content at your fingertips. Paying 15$ a month for a maybe a few days worth of leveling content/story and then literally running the same raids and dungeons over and over is incredibly stupid. BFA has been out for 9 months now, does it really feel like they've released $135 ($180 if you factor in the cost of the expac) worth of content?
---
Sad thing is how garbage it is for a PvE scene too, considering everyone basically has to run the exact same comp..
---
Sounds like you want to heal...just do that?
---
Stockades for Wool cloth, right?
---
SM for what, silk? I was never a hardcore player, but from what I remember silk was the only cloth you don't need to farm it drops so much. Wool is the rare stuff and to an extent mageweave. 
---
Am I missing something about SM for tailoring? Otherwise I'd say dont' worry about SM farming worry about DM farming for mageweave and pre SM dungeons for wool.
---
amen brother, retail is a monstrosity of what it once was. It's honestly not even WoW any more, it's just a collectable hack n' slash game.

---
gonna happen to classic too... but there won't be any fresh. maybe blizz will do server merges idk
---
exactly, you gotta join the guild which supports the amount of time you want to invest, and the progression you're seeking.
---
and if that guild doesn't exist, you can make it
---
for sure I'm expecting pugs who slap groups together in trade chat to sometimes have 'unreasonable expectations for progression'
---
I’d still like to see a test for this. But, it’s kinda moot since Fury/Prot isn’t viable until healers get some BWL gear.
---
I just want to play. I cannot wait to experience Vanilla. I started playing like a week before TBC dropped so I never really got the Vanilla experience.
---
sweet. I didn't realize dressing room showed animations. Let the deliberations begin!!
---
Idk man..
---
If you are in a serious guild, you’ve got 3-4 tanks and 4-6 dps warriors. 
---
If you are a tank, consider yourself as 5th to 9th on the list depending upon your seniority within the tanks. 
---
If you tank and you want to get a dungeon blue set you can use to PvP with so you can get the PvP set and rep rewards, then that’d be easy. Just don’t let dps warriors in your 5 man’s. Who knows, if you can demonstrate you’re out there pvping—gear or not—you may be able to be closer to 5th than 9th.

Back in time I went for skinning + leatherworking in vanilla and ... as I was pvp focussed... I dropped them at lvl 60 and switched to engineering + enchanting ... 
---
I suggest mining + engineering as more useful option if you want optimal choice (and fun as engineering got ton of funny stuff:P ) 
---
If you want RP style take skinning and leatherworking ... it is fun and it suits the class ... it has weird feeling of fulfillment as a hunter to skin those animals and use those parts to create something :)
---
Now that’s a classic video
---
yeah lets pretend, that like 6 years of hundreds of thousands of people playing on vanilla private servers didn't happen. common man..
---
p.s. some ppl always gets triggered when private servers are brought up, but even blizzard straight up aknowledged their major role in that we'll have official vanilla now. and that their success let them moved them to do the official classic.. yes private servers arent one to one accurate but they are pretty good, like 90% is correct.
---
So everyone you know is sick of listening to you, so now you want us to listen to you?
---
No thanks...
---
Ret has way better mobility than enhance. Yes enhance has ghost wolf, but it's terrible, it's a very poor version of travel form. If you get frost nova'd as a shaman you're stuck in 1 spot for 8 seconds. If you get entangling roots'd you're stuck there for 12. That's extremely bad for a melee hero. You can basically give up on ever hitting a hunter/frost mage, or really any other class when a hunter or frost mage is around. You're not in plate so you can't tank enemy warriors/rogues at all, while a ret can tank them for a bit and then has 2 bubbles if needed and has a reliable 6 second stun.

Ill be severing all ties with the outside world for at least a week.
---
Is there an internal cooldown for Orc racial Hardiness? Or can it procc few 2+ times in a row?
---
Fuuuuck
---
I will sever all ties with the outside world
---
It depends on how far you want to take things, but I firmly believe you can manage to clear everything but AQ40 and Naxx with a subpar spec. You're right though, you'll have to invest more time and effort than cookie cutter specs. It's entirely doable though. I believe a good fit for you might be Shaman, you can heal just fine in 30/0/21, and it's a great spec in PvP and for 5mans.
---
Tailoring can only make up to 14 slot bags I think. Right now on ascension traveler backpacks are like 80-100g lol
---
I play on one and one of the guild names is "Here to Stay" and thats their message of recruiting is that they wont be joining in on the mass exodus to actual Blizzard servers which I find bizarre in every aspect. 
---
            
---
The perks from playing on real Blizzard servers are high, there will be a booming population that cant be found on almost all P. Servers  even though they claim 2500+ on Saturdays it's maybe 350 at most? High player base means more dungeon runs and a healthy economy, plus actual game values and permanent characters.               
---
             
---
Like I get it if you live in Euroslaviastan where everyone makes less than a dollar a day and your only option is to steal (Lets be honest it's theft, I'm farting around on one till Classic but I'm not deluded into thinking it's anything else) So I get it maybe $15 /month is way too much but these P. Servers already have population issues and Classic is going to torpedo them into an even shittier state.         
---
You think your P. Server sucks now because of all the Web-site shop spam just wait till Classic hits, some of these guys live off this asset flip shit. I just cant imagine trying to scrape by on a dead ass P. Server while everyone else is enjoying the real deal.
---
This is true because some BiS items like wrist, offhand and wands were green for casters until they could raid aq 40. Other items that had a % chance to do something or a fast weapon speed worked better than aq 40 or naxx gear.
---

Have you never played D&amp;D? It’s like 70% murder hobo, and quests that enable you to go murder hoboing, then you force yourself through the story part of the quest before you get back to murder hoboing. 
---
All while your DM cries because he built this entire tactical encounter and world and y’all kill everyone instead of reading the quest log.
---
Get the white stallion instead. I rock that thing every day in retail
---
In the words of a very great man, "Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby."
---
These would help more if the recommended spells that can be skipped, or ones that only require one rank.  Although that's a little subjective so I kind of see why they don't

I think that private servers and Classic will be different enough. One big thing: Classic will stay forever, nobody would delete your character. That means that people would want to keep playing that character. With private servers opening and closing every day, nothing is permanent, people are just not attached to their character and those who are attached probably either won't play or stop after first server close.
---
There is no sound in the clip, can you hear the grass?
---
&gt; The gameplay is the gameplay and that will never change
---
famous last words
---
\*although gameplay changes to classic don't frighten me in the least, lmao
---
yeah but he dont smack against eachother thing is referencing to height.
---
Oh, even out TPSing the Fury tanks ;)
---
Simply check the fights on private servers. Almost every single fight with top DPS parses has a druid tank. But tps isn't everything all of the time. Some bosses can't be tanked by druids due to mechanics (i.e. armor debuffs) and that's when Warriors are still the better choice. Also every AoE scenario.
---
can't prove it with theorycrafting and whatnot, can only go by what's happening on pservers for years.
---
I haven't played Vanilla. (Though I've played pservers enough to know what I'm getting into.) It's a very good game and I'm looking forward to playing it. In fact I've created a whole guild for the purpose. :) I've been playing games for 30 years now. Games don't become "outdated". I can go back and play any of my old favorites and enjoy them just as much as I did when I first played them. It's obviously not exactly the same. You can't have the same feeling when you first encountered them and they were radical and new. But good games are good games, forever.
---
Everything is what you make of it. You won't be playing with all those hundreds of thousands of people who'll be playing Classic. Find people who you enjoy playing with. Play the game and don't worry about what all the others think or do. If you find you don't enjoy it, stop and don't look back. Find something else. It's a game, don't overanalyze it. :)
---
Seeing all of these ability training guides, I think I'm going to make a "which spells you should actually train while leveling" guide.
---
Ah, the ol "baby Hitler" defense.
---
To add: You can also quest in Elwynn until level 4, train those spells, then start in Teldrassil if you don't mind being behind a little bit. Quests start going grey at level 6 in Teldrassil.
---
That's far harder to do. You need to be near max level and negates all nostalgia from doing the NE content.
---
there is no bottom
---
Yeah that's a fair point. I can't imagine many people get past the first mythic raid boss of any given tier.
---
Will the tokens work at TGI Friday’s though?
---
Im levelling a dude on a TBC private server :p Has been fun so far.
---
Why TBC you might ask, and well its simply because TBC has stuff that Classic wont so i can still enjoy the character even after Classic is released.
---
So do you. ;)
---
Why not accrue value into a investment portfolio??
---
Then you can buy an unlimited amount of WoW classic????????????
---
Honestly travel. People die all the time wishing they did.
---
I mean, I don't feel particularly overwhelmed.  You never show up to anything anymore anyway.  So this would be just... more of you not ever showing up.  God Speed Alpha of Ants.
---
um, what looks better in 8.2? the whole xpac is just bad...
---
Where did you get that he is dead? I haven't found anything on that.
---
that's sick. maybe I will buy one in the future but it might not be the same feeling as having bought it yourself.
---
I will be closing the poll at midnight tonight. I guess to compile the data and to make the pie graphs that were requested. thank you for all the participation. I will post them here. If you want to here my comments I will be streaming at about noon pacific time tomorrow. @marktatsu on twitch and then the video will be on youtube later that day.
---
Same, living in the dorms, grouped by engineering major.  This game was not good for our grades when every day was a LAN party.
---
&gt;Have you never played D&amp;D? It’s like 70% murder hobo
---
I don't play shit D&amp;D. Murderhobos is a symptom of an awful GM or an awful group of people to play with.
---
WOW drew a lot of influences from D&amp;D combat but not the roleplaying part which is based on character choice. WOW is a game where you follow the script and do what the quest text says. It doesn't provide multiple ways to complete a quest so a warlock cannot differentiate themselves from a druid. You do it as the quest says and move on to the next part of the script.
---
WOW is Diablo at the core just as the older MMO games were. Kill things to get better loot from the things. Repeat the cycle.

There's video evidence on youtube dude.. [https://youtu.be/1tABS2jzgTY](https://youtu.be/1tABS2jzgTY)
---
Gun and Crossbow are really close, if not the same. IIRC.
---
I have no idea why you're getting downvoted to oblivion.  Literally everyone who is a prominent warcraft classic advocate on YouTube agrees with that sentiment.  Vanilla content was a different type of difficult.  Mechanically today's raids are far more complex than the raids of vanilla.
---
Off-topic or a bit off topic: i am glad that we get sharding for early zones for some weeks. Playing on a full server and having like 10 people camping spawn points suck really really hard
---
Human mage of course
---
The p.server I play on is actually very well run. The community is global and while there is a bit of pay-to-win going on, it seems to work quite well. The only real issue I have is the fact that bugs go unfixed indefinitely and customer support, even for donators like myself, is nonexistent.
---
Leatherworking is a pretty garbage profession unless you intend to focus on crafting items like devilsaur sets for gold at 60.
---
For personal use, it is pretty garbage and engineering trumps it 100x over.
---
Fear Ward isn't what makes dwarfs better then NE.  It's stoneform + desperate prayer.  There are only a handful of bosses that use fear and having it isn't necessary.
---
Thank you for mentioning Dark Souls. I think it strikes the perfect balance of having a story without completely shoving it down your throat. Imo Diablo 2 did the same thing. Learning the lore through NPC interaction. Wow's storytelling is absolutely atrocious now. Uncontrollable warchief -&gt; oust warchief -&gt; new warchief -&gt; repeat
---
* Dungeons are mindlessly easy content since the nerd in Cataclysm. They require no use of specific skills to handle threats. They are not better.
---
* Raiding is arguably better I will give you that.
---
* The storyline is probably why I stopped playing live. This is subjective but if you thought Illidan and Sylvanas tipping their Fedora's the last 2 years was good writing then that's just your opinion but I disagree.
---
Just because the game LOOKS better and has much more technically impressive cinematics and questline interactions does not make it a better game. It's different and that's partly why it's bad. It's missing the depth and care that made it good and replaced it with fancy graphics to give the impression of "polish".
---
I absolutley agree. The cheesy, cartoon-villain like demeanor he displayed through out the expac was the most disappointing, esp. considering what a great character he was in WC3.
---
That being said, i really liked the final cinematic after defeating him. The scene with his father putting him to rest hit the tone for me.
---
You literally just showed the original video. This isnt proof of anything.
---
Or people have a different playstyle. Damn no reason to shit on other people’s choices. Lot of people don’t like to role play and want to use their class abilities, no sense in shitting on them for it.
---
Yeah I completely wasted my nap and messed up my sleep cycle for nothing. Shoulda just gone to sleep and started playing in the morning :p
---
Very very true.. I need to remind myself more of this. I will do some trekking in the end of June. But it's in a nabouring country(Norway) so it feels a lot like home.
---
It's more scary to go further across the globe, it's easier to do something that I've done before, Wow. But yeah. Wow will still be there when I get back if I decide to go...
---
Thx for the awesome input. Have you been travelling a lot? I haven't, only been to my naibours which speak almost the same language. Denmark and Norway.
---
pretty much. only thing that kind of makes it worth it i guess is to see and hear the amazing art and i like supporting artists in video games. but im kind of biased since im an animator lol
---
Go to r/buildapcforme instead, they’ll hook you up with a pcpartpicker link and all.
---
And I believe they're gonna stay expensive for a while, until the market saturates a few months in. Before that, Runecloth bags will be seen as the sensible alternative.

There will be a lot of people trying out vanilla for the first time on release. These people are the ones coming from retail and aren’t used to being killed by a pack of 2 mobs. And because of this I believe that a large majority of these players will say “this game is to hard” and will straight up quit or go back to retail. A large portion of people who will stick around are the ones who played vanilla back when it was brand new. And I hope I’m wrong, but in all honesty I don’t think the number of classic players will outshine the number of retail players (even with the shit storm it is in right now). Classic is not at all a forgiving game, and most new comers won’t be able to handle it.
---
You are correct on the cloth types. Theres nothing special about them in regards to tailoring, except that they're both filled wih humanoids so you get lots of cloth.
---
Exactly!
---
I mean... there's thousands of addons out there for every little thing. You can't just list every single one of them and colour them grey just to indicate "no information". Everyone's gonna be looking for their favorite ones! 
---
I feel like it makes more sense for the grey addons to be those that are actually confirmed by their authors that they will not be supported for Classic.
---
Elemental shaman or warrior for pvp? Assuming I can get good gear. I have a mage and a druid in my group too.
---
At work I'm thinking about it for at least 4 hours a day, It's pretty fucking sick but I love it.  Kind of puts me in another world and makes my work day go by faster.
---
Legitimately reminds me of being in highschool, and doing that every god damn day.
---
Did you really just take off the audio and repost this terrible meme...
---
Nicely put.  In vanilla reading and paying attention had 2 benefits:
---
\- Lore, which can be fun/interesting for players, but also an immersive RPG element.
---
\- Details that directly helped you with quests and provided utility in the world you were playing, which offers more incentive to keep reading.
---
When everything is a faceroll there's no incentive (in general) to stop/slow-down and participate in the world you're playing in - gameplay &amp; community both suffer.
---
Yeah. No way I’m paying more than20g for 16 slots lol

I'm doing 19 twinks on the biggest vanilla server. Luckily I have a fairly geared 60 from last year, so farming cash is pretty easy. And a good twink doesn't take more than a handful of days and a few hundred gold.
---
Yeah. I'd rather spend a few months farming level 60 10-mans for the 16 slot ones. I got more important things to spend money on!
---
You can tank dungeons in arms or fury spec right up to the 55-60 dungeons and be fine. Just slap a one hander and shield on and go into defensive stance.
---
Why are so many people pessimistic about the release date? If they said have a classic summer 
---
Sure they don’t mean in August. Let’s be hopeful here!
---
Was there even a zeppelin in vanilla? I thought there was only a ship in Ratchet.
---
That may be true, but that is not the point. He was not carried by the group. The point is that a try hard paladin will just do fine in a pug setting, because there will be so many slackers in a random pug.
---
Expectation: You won't get any progress unless you BiS your class &amp; gear
---
Reality: You'll join a fun guild that progresses through the content.
---
Thanks for the explanation, very much appreciated friend. 
---
I can understand why Blizzard as a business would want to switch to containers under the hood, but as a customer and player I don't see why I should have to suffer for it, when in fact the game has performed so much better in the past. 
---
That's what I meant by "limited by tech". We had crappier PCs that couldn't handle as much and it still worked. Now we all own PCs that we couldn't even dream of back in 2004. 
---
Sidenote: I don't need you think a TL;DR for four phrases. ...or is this the world that we live in now? :C
---
Fair enough, sounds kinda gatekeeping to me, but fair enough.
---
Firstly, it doesn’t have to be an either or. Given you don’t know anything about vanilla, it’ll probably take you a bit to get to level 60 and do your 5 mans. So you may even pick up the devout pieces. Then that dungeon gear is what gets you into Mc where prophecy is.
---
Neither is amazing for a priest, but neither is terrible for the effort involved in getting it. And both are somewhat effective. I’ve seen priests outheal (and under overheal) pre bis priests when they are wearing devout—being good still counts for a lot.
---
I don't mind picking a night and committing, but all too often raid time is wasted from people being late, being AFK, or whatever. That's what really gets to me. I hate being on time and prepared, only to wait an extra hour to get started because no one else was ready.
---
If I can get into a group of people who will be on time and start when we say so, I don't mind having a night or two revolve around raiding.
---
One of the sites I use posted a guide "specifically maximizing Darnassus reputation to reach Exalted for the Nightsaber mounts" (WIP)
---
It's written for rogues but may be of some use to you:  [http://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm](http://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm) 
---
I glanced at it, and its definitely NOT meant to powerlevel, but rather to have the rep and money to get your nightsaber at 40.
---
can you blame it on nostalgia if you never played classic before, but you want an authentic, social experience?
---
nah, fans like that don't exist.
---
Maybe the new norm will be to actually extend the raids out the whole week at first. 2-3 bosses each night! There will definitely be guilds dedicated to the parent schedule.
---
although it makes less than zero sense why you'd have a problem with a BFA token seller getting their 120k gold because you bought their gametime token on classic by spending a calculated-classic-equivalent amount of gold to their 120k
---
Sounds like someone's ego was bruised. You corrected me and made an error in reading comprehension, but instead of moving on or admit your mistake you thought you'd move the goal posts. Ok.
---
Tell me about all those juicy fury talents after you get the 5 crit? Is it unbridled wrath with a slow 2H? Is it the sub-20 AP added from 5/5 imp BS? The self-crit talents that will never proc? Death wish is up 1/3rd as often as sweeping strikes, deals less damage, and you actually take more damage when it is up. By the time you finally get Flurry which won't proc reliably with your low crit, you are almost 40 and it is time to switch to mortal strike anyways.
---
If I don't know what I'm talking about, please enlighten me. Tell me how 2H fury is better than 2H arms. I like to learn. :)
---
They took away our unique weapon, the artifact. They said it was because people want weapon drops, which I can understand. But why not make it where the artifact "eats" the weapon to gain strength? So you basically do look forward to upgrades, but get to keep the artifact weapon.
---
I got attached to my artifact weapon on a character level. Transmogging isn't the same, that's just aesthetics.
---
That's what it's making fun of.
---
Quite the opposite.  
---
I'm saying her hair is fine the way it is, and that adding a pile of peacock feathers on top distracts from her face.  
---
Keep in mind that you're the one proposing changes, not me.
---
Well cmon, he linked devout and prophecy t0 and t1. You’re linking shit from bwl and green dragons coming out months later.
---
Do you mean exclusively for leveling? Because if you mean end-game, I think you have some misconceptions about warlock. For a much more in-depth analysis of warlock raiding than I could provide, you should check out [I'm alive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmKo5VFzyqpfT5VNAivMHJQ) who is a competitive warlock raider and makes really detailed tutorial videos going into the minutia of warlocks and why they're such a good dps class with a surprising amount of depth. 
---
It's really not possible to make a good pro/con list without first explaining what you're trying to get out of them. Do you want to raid? How much, and how far are you planning on progressing? How much do you plan on grinding for gold? Is fast leveling more important, or do you want to have a more enjoyable leveling experience where you run dungeons repeatedly?
---
And that's before you even get into even more subjective questions, like what role do you want (dps vs. healer vs. tank) and what kind of playstyle in particular do you like.
---
Kazzak should be more demon-y somehow...Otherwise everything else is pretty damn sweet
---
There is also a sword from a quest in there that is just a shade under pre-raid BiS for rogues (possibly warriors too, not sure about their itemization). So it's an important dungeon.
---
I agree, I was going to say the most likely reason is cost.

i honestly didn't find out classic was even happening until last week, but i will say i've been firmly on the hype train since then and can't wait for it to drop
---
At least he had chicken
---
True, but pre-raid BIS - plus the odd raid upgrade is plenty enough for an offtank
---
"authentic social experience" = "playing through the game as though it's a completely new thing, in the way that you have no 'list of game achievements you're checking off, hurrying through, and soloing everything', rather that you "naturally" stop and talk to people, you form groups, you BS and mess around, what the kids call 'having fun organic to the experience and with no underlying motivation to gogogo all the time'?
---
except that you already have some of those 'gogogo ideas', and 'things to do on your checklist', if you've only played BFA, or Legion, or Draenor...and are experiencing Classic for the first time...because you've more than likely been in classic zones in BFA. You've experienced a version of Westfall, or Barrens, and you will find mobs or certain quests that \*are\* familiar. so your 'social experience' will still be affected, altered, or inauthentic
---
Or maybe it won't. I shouldn't have said 'nostalgia failing', because nostalgia ain't a sentient thing that can be blamed. It's us who get blamed for our choosing to invest in nostalgia
---
worrying about having an 'authentic, social, classic experience' gets in the way of having an 'actual, social, classic experience'

How is troll better in pvp for healing?
---
Sick, thanks for sharing. Best of luck in Classic!
---
I remember going out late night to go to a superstore ASDA in the UK for WOTLK launch. Met hundreds of people there. Just knowing all were there just for a wow release was insane, nerdy, but awesome.
---
This is really cool, for some reason I love messing with talent calcs.
---
I like the added level tracker at the bottom, and the save function is nice
---
Bugs:
---
* You cant remove points from lower tiers even when all prerequisites are met otherwise
---
* Priest's Spirit does not increment properly
---
* Priest's Imp Psychic Scream effect shows twice rather than replacing/increasing the previous rank
---
* Rogue's Gouge should be x/3 rather than x/5
---
* Mage's Arcade meditation should be x3/ rather than x/5
---
Suggestions: 
---
* A reset function for an individual tree would be a nice addition, though I could see this causing issues interacting with the level tracker
---
* Remove the color tha denotes an available talent once all points are spent (at level 60)
---
* Display the corresponding talent tooltip when mousing over the level tracker icons
---
Please keep working on it though, I'll definitely keep using this.
---
Not casual players. Blizzard went from ignoring the 1% raiders to catering their game to them.
---
Gottem.
---
Guns and crossbows share the same animations.
---
Both Male and Female orcs have a pretty standard shooters posture, strait backed. Weapon at chest hight.
---
Male trolls lean back, weapon at head hight (only ones that really look down the sights of their weapon) pretty exaggerated stance.
---
Female trolls, less of a shooter posture then orcs, don't quite stand astride correctly for an actual shooters posture.
---
Male and Female Tauren, they share roughly the same animation, they both Hip fire their weapon. Kinda the worst imo. Really doesn't look at that smooth.
---
If I had to pick one, Male Troll. They have the best overall animations in my opinion, however it is just my opinion.
---
Depends on what you want to do, you listed being a healer as a pro. Most guilds will make you raid as a heal spec. If you want to raid, I hope you like healing.
---
Druid= Nature hippie goodboi
---
Warlock= Bad Motherfucker
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but one of the few hard stats out there about retail was kts armor being 2800. The pserver that had 2 guilds clear naxx day1 doubled that armor to 5800.
---
NSFW, really?
---
I would be more than certain that we get a release date or a beta by the end of this month. If not a release date this month then it will be next month but I think a beta is certain.
---
I wont u do it.  
---
You friendly redditor
---
Listing druid as having the "option" to heal is a bit backwards.
---
The amount of hit needed to not have spells resist. (Though there is always a 1% chance.) I think it was 9% cap for even level mobs, 18% for raid bosses, and 4% for pvp. So the idea is you get enough hit to bring you to 1% under those totals depending on what you want.
---
Unlike those 40 man raids in Vanilla.
---
WTF are you even talking about.
---
...i've been watching alot of tipsout (baby). is he not considered knowledgeable in the community? i noticed he was really pushing /sit leveling. his 'interview' with monkeynews was also pretty terrible ("wow thats crazy").  
---
just wondering what other people's thoughts are, and what i should be checking out as a planned warrior main in classic.
---
Feeling cute today, hit em with a super clever poo poo jape.  Might delete later.
---
I don't know when they will announce it but I think Classic WoW will be released on July 30th, 2019 so ATVI can pad their subscriber numbers during their earnings call in early August.
---
Get LW +skinning at start while leveling and then ditch skinning at some point when max for engineering if you really wanna keep LW. All serious raids want that you have engineering.
---
That's really awesome, did you make this?
---
Thanks for the videos. They prove it was nothing like /sit in private servers and you only get a charge every 3-4 attacks and of course has no value at all for levelling - which is probably why it was never mentioned in any vanilla levelling guides ever.
---
I'm in my 4th guild that never completed a single tf from mc-naxx. Current guild hasn't seen a single binding and has cleared mc since week 7 of server and naxx just dropped
---
Yes I played vanilla, did you? Or did you just spend your the whole time watching other people play it?
---
Who cares who got world firsts or pvped on a server I never played on?  Why would those things matter?
---
Oh yeah, for sure.  The RPG aspect of WoW has been neglected a very long time now.
---
yikes thats a wall of text
---
I don't play retail wow, I don't enjoy retail wow. 
---
I've played about 50 hours on a vanilla pserver, for me it's ALL about smelling the flowers.
---
I don't want sharding. shoot me
---
That's actually a drop in vanilla I kid you not. It's the hungering cold off kt, exact same model
---
In my opinion people obsess over meta style gameplay far to much, and that is fine, but a lot of this gameplay is only available to those without serious time constraints.
---
You may have to play two days straight, and eight hours a day thereafter to get ahead, and control resources etc. But you don’t need to play this way in order to find a good raiding guild, gear up, and meet good people.
---
Sure the minority of players will rush through the game, create an exclusive social and raiding environment, thus cutting themselves off from the rest of the people on te server, and in conclusion will be frothing at the mouth for new content, and perhaps growing bored.
---
In my opinion this small demographic accelerated the progress of a new server, and gives people a feeling that they are constantly behind. Where as in truth raiding casually and progressing at your own pace is and will always be perfectly acceptable. Raiding and other endgame content is not as serious and demanding as the top one percent make it out to be. There will be plenty of guilds out there looking to have fun and kill some bosses with their guildies.
---
I’m government and put it all in during October for the whole next year. Lots of guessing and hoping.
---
No I was just agreeing with my friend there. We prefer to take in the atmosphere of what the raid IS. The idea of me walking into an incredibly dangerous dungeon with a huge group of people that have all been together through countless battles and finally taking the fight to the big bad boss in his own home.
---
The fact that I get "howtokilltheboss.txt" to read and then proceed to speed run the dungeon ruins the atmosphere that I enjoy. I have done mythic+. Why am I slam dunking glowing orbs into the wall to squeeze out a worm? Was there something before that lead me to believe that this would be effective? Or am I just doing it because that's what the manual says to do?
---
I'm not saying that modern raids are bad or not fun, I just don't think they are better than vanilla raids simply because they have more things to do. Personally, I would love to see modern raid bosses and their zany antics added to battlegrounds. Imagine capping towers in AV and you have to fight Mother.
---
With a hunter pet tanking you could utilize the Warlock’s damage dealing / utility pets instead!
---
Lol all you do is spend all your time policing people, being a asshole, and banning people who call you out. I bet you were the kid who thought being a hall monitor gave him real power. Have fun spending the rest of your life in your mom's basement lurking on reddit and 4chan.
---
How did you get burned may I ask? The only Blizzard games I play are Overwatch and Hearthstone and they both gave me my money's worth.
---
So you played retail wow and private servers, best of luck with separating Nostalgia from that authentic social experience
---
The description reads [Full of possibilities, but a long way off]
---
You youngins that think you're old are adorable. 
---
Though I was only in college in 2004 so others here probably think the same about me.

It is pre-BiS not according to me but [the author of the video.](https://youtu.be/iIiCEW9oVFI?t=420) To say it is more useful at lower gear than higher gear is crazy since higher gear will equate to faster kill times.  If you mean that if you have higher gear you would farm something somewhere else then again that kinda proves my point. (Although outside of hunters what class excels at soling Mara?)  
---
My only point was that for a **FRESH** lvl 60 this is not a good farm for the gold per hour.  That is all I mentioned and I am still not incorrect on that point.    
---
The only one complaining here is you, about my opinion about this point. I am not on some bizarre anti-youtuber bandwagon.  You see me out there harasing other yt content providers?  I only had one point. You disagree but I believe the math and logic works out in my favor.    
---
Feel free to have the last say but I am def. not worked up about this, just stating my case.  Guess you're just trying to prove Cunningham's Law lol.
---
Bre is better, the 2h axe off rag is close. Then once bwl is out asscandy is also better, and untamed blade
---
Legion and bfa were pretty flawless at launch.
---
Kts loot table actually
---
What other games?
---
I decided to try out classic wow on a private server just before 2 summers ago before they announced classic. I had a blast, i've never been much of a PVPer or hardcore raider (except in TBC). I remember not reaching 60 back in real vanilla. 
---
But i've always loved farming mounts, gold, rep and recipes/formulas. 
---
I had a blast logging in and farming gold, having money actually be worth something, buying all the cool flask recipes. Running lower levels through Maraudon. 
---
Sure the raids were piss easy and my guild usually cleared everything with 5 people short. But that's not the appeal for me anymore. Its the community, having people whisper me and ask me to make flask or enchant stuff for them, having a reputation and rivals.
---
We will get the release date in the morning of the last day of summer. The game will release at 11:59 pm that night.
---
Thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for!
---
That's the sad story of d&amp;d players too 😖
---
It's not down voted because we're not reading. It's down voted because your ideas here are inherently antithetical to Classic WoW's whole mission. 
---
Fuck off,

#NoChanges
---
Beautiful
---
I'm floored that people still buy into the "it's just nostalgia" argument. My brain short circuits because I can't understand how stupid you'd have to be to honestly believe that.
---
Engineering isn’t cheese. Sure it is hands down the best profession for PvP but in no way is it cheese . But If I’m in a duel damn straight I’ll use a engineering trinket, because it extends the limitations of my class. You may see it as tryharding in a duel but all I can see is I’m more likely to win.
---
1 reason would be that thrash blade is pre-bis or close to pre-bis for fury and so you almost never want to not pick it if you plan on being a dps warrior at 60. I don't think DW is better for leveling at this point personally but you should almost always pick the thrash blade from the quest and just find another 2h somewhere else even if you are sticking with arms.
---
They are the strongest defensive healer by a mile. Unique to just paladin they have
---
Plate armor and shield
---
Blessing of freedom for Melee/flag carry
---
Poly immune due to sacrifice
---
Then they also have 
---
Low mana dispel
---
Long as hell stun 
---
Their only real weakness is their reliance on the holy tree, so counterspell really hits them hard
---
Played the tits off Vanilla. Kept tabs on the success stories rather than the nonsense. Apologies for aspiring to be a top raider or Grand Marshal rather than perfecting how to pull the most whelps. Leave your capital city once in a while when Classic comes out mate.

# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Started by a bunch of irl friends (**and already at 30 members**) with top tier experience through all expansions. (**including world 8th kill TOTC**), Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours. 
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We wanna give everyone a fair chance so if you wanna be Role officers or Raid leader the challenge is here and we will make you feel at home.
---
* We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Thu(+Sunday on progress). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will probably use Loot Council but DKP is still in discussion.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord **KingMavros#2601**

I was for #nochanges on the graphics. Now I am #maybechanges on the graphics lol.
---
They want paying first....
---
I still think Mike sucks
---
That isn't the only thing to consider though. At this point only time will tell, but I am leaning towards at least a week before it is 100% cleared. Things like world buffs are also more lenient on private servers(no cooldowns) so that is something else to take into account.
---
Come on.. stop burning me
---
I thought so, too. I got really disappointed in BFA after two months. Then I found a prominent pserver and it was almost like the real thing. Not to speak to the benefit of the pserver, but to say I remembered why this is the best game I've ever played and it's not the same one I am able to buy right now. I stopped playing since it feels like Classic is actually coming soon (after about 10d /played), cannot wait to get the nostalgia going once again, but this time officially.
---
Generic call outposts just looking for trouble. This is what happens when you read too many posts from other people who talked about just nostalgia, and you don't take the time to respond to each of them personally. It builds up in you, that frustration, until you finally just make a generic call out post of your own.
---
balance druid is good in PVP and moonkin is "playable" in PVE if you tryhard and aren't in a min max guild
---
Reddit is an echo chamber, people come in with preconceptions and vote accordingly.  This subreddit is just as guilty of that
---
Ok good to know, thanks. I'll probably be on the Switch still since I like the option to pick up and go.
---
Lol because it takes months to get maybe?
---
I got a month of game time and excitedly hopped online. Invited my friends to a party and they all decided to declined. 🙃

Semi-Hardcore | PVE on PVP Server | Eastern US Timezone | Alliance     
---
Hi, we're an easy going, fun loving guild, who plan to explore every nook and cranny of Classic and be in the first 5 guilds to clear naxx.     
---
We currently have 35 players committed, and are on pace for 175 players by late June.  We acknowledge that the first to every benchmark will be dedicated try hards. We're going to be the big party having a good time in 2nd.  Our goal is to maximize fun, and while winning is definitely a lot of fun, it's even more fun to win as a team without some annoying officer whining about that time you got hit by a raid boss's ability, or missed your interrupt, w/e.  
---
 We're going to support each other while leveling, we're going to pool our resources so everyone can have their mount at 40, if you're roleing warrior or another class hard to level, we're going to pair you with someone who can make leveling more efficient (pet classes and druid do well on their own).   
---
 When it's time for raid content, we're going to make you watch youtube videos on all the engagements and write a test to prove you know your stuff, and we'll make sure your gear/consumables means we have a chance at clearing.  Once that's out of the way, it's all good. No pressure, lots of laughs, wipe often and have an amazing time.     
---
We believe a positive enjoyable raiding experience will keep players coming back, and keep the guild strong all the way through to endgame.     
---
So all are welcome, we don't have dedicated PVPers right now, but if you'd like to join and create a subdivision for PvP you are more than welcome to do so.  
---
Please PM me if you are interested
---
I’m dead set on Priest this time around, and I while I’m digging everything you guys have laid out, I see the SP position is filled (no biggie) and that Priests are in low demand for y’all. How “low demand” is that?  I’m a mid 30s IT professional, a Vanilla-&gt;BC vet and really like your disposition. I didn’t want to put a full app before reaching out and seeing what the heals situation was and inadvertently wasting your time. 
---
My goals are being main heals, gearing well, grabbing Benediction/Anathema. A lofty but fun goal would be seeing how far one could progress with Atiesh. I’m also set on Human, if that’s a factor. 
---
Fully prepared to get nothing and i’m going to keep refreshing just the same
---
This is the logic someone hit me with that made me decide to roll a new class. It'll be different so embrace it and also... Correct we can drink now 🤣
---
Out of all the races, tauren is my least favourite aesthetically but damn they have the prettiest starting zone, it's so relaxing.
---
NA PVP realm horde guild looking for players.
---
Core that we have now are all private server vets and looking for anyone and everyone who wants to raid!
---
Msg me if you got any questions :)
---
I'm going to start with skinning and LW to begin with and then drop them for mining and engineering once I get to 60.
---
It's going to be really hard to keep up with your engineering with your level with the amount of people fighting over nodes but you'll never run out of beasts to skin including ones that other people have killed. And if you do need to spend a bit of time gathering materials to up your crafting you'll be getting xp while killing beasts instead of running around trying to mine or having to spend your gold buying it off the ah.
---
Selfless, hardworking administrators of Nostralius are one thing, while whiny peons are another thing entirely.
---
Haha this hit me in the feels. Totally overbuilt my gaming PC a couple years back because I was "totally going to overclock, add memory, SLI/crossfire".  Now I've got 850w of gold powering probably 400w of computer. Lol
---
Well to be fair I have a broken hand and texting on 1 hand with a huge phone is hard, makes me look more upset than I am. But it is extremely frustrating to see such an attitude from r/wow like they are playing the holy Grail of MMOs (BFA). When it's hot garbage and nobody wants to admit it to themselves. It's cool if ppl enjoy bfa.. but statistically speaking it is lesser version, a game that isn't as desired, a watered down but very aethetically pleasing iteration of WoW.
---
I don't think we'll get an actual release date until it's imminent. I think it's likely we'll get beta after 8.2 PTR ends which should be first couple weeks of June
---
Mortal strike debuff on a raid mob tho :(
---
I don't like retail as much as the next guy, but these types of posts are cancer.
---
Believe it or not, but some people prefer modern WoW over vanilla. They've got their game and a subreddit to discuss it.
---
There's no need to go there and bash them for it.
---
Just be glad that we're finally getting our version of the game.
---
RemindMe! 1 Day "This guy says we'll get a release date for WoW Classic."
---
It's proof that he died...
---
They're just dismissive of us because they don't like it or they're too afraid to actually try and find out they might enjoy the experience.
---
It's much easier for them to badmouth Classic then it is for them to accept the fact that other people have different taste in gaming. 
---
It's sad really, the mental gymnastics one puts themself through. It must be exhausting.
---
I totally agree, the internet is very echochambered. Unbiased and informed opinions  are hard to come by.

Crap I forgot about how much they cost

It's beautiful, but the smooth edges and textures just doesn't feel like WoW to me.
---
Kind of looks like Overwatch lol.
---
Human mage is the worst combo in the game.
---
One is useful. One is useless.
---
Facts.
---
Noob here. What's the difference between armoured and unarmoured mounts?
---
Even if you're on a PvP server. Mages are the fastest class 1-10, then Hunters take over once they get a pet. But a Mage who can break off from the pack early on and be one of the first to start catching the good AoE Areas (Duskwood Worgen, Arathi Farms, etc) will level extremely quickly and will blow past anyone except the best/most efficient Hunters.
---
Escape artist is stronger than WoTF. 
---
Getting out of roots and snares on a 1 minute cool down is borderline broken.
---
Lol I bet you were the one that downvoted me
---
That's what turns me off raiding too. I can't play games for 3 hours non stop like I could when I was a teenager. I need to do something else every now and then, even if it's just alt tabbing to read Reddit or something.
---
Hi, /u/M4yze
---
You're missing the point. Im merely highlighting the biased mindset of bfa players who haven't even touched classic before, suddenly having a 1 aisize fits all opinion, "iz nostalgia goggles huehue"
---
Why are you here arguing with us? r/wow is that way ------&gt;
---
That's why it got the fame it did, right? Because it didn't deserve it lmao.
---
There is a reason Why people not even playing WoW know about this joke(meme nowadays). It was hella great and definity deserved the fame it got.
---
Do you drown kittens?
---
I mean, thats good. The less of these people coming to classic, the better. Let the bitch all they want. Well see what song they will sing if blizzard fails with their next expansion.
---
Then again, leave their reddit alone. Don't turn into one of them trolls that come from Retail just to grief, instead of actually being interested in why some want to go back in time.
---
Yeah I agree. It’s very braindead and most people will get bored of the simplicity.

BEST meme ive Saw on this subreddit. I always check for memes at bathroom and thisone made me shit hard.
---
Yeah, I don't really understand why people are acting like this. I'm just as excited as the next diehard classic fan, but sitting around and spamming f5 on the blue tracker is doing nothing but wasting your time and probably giving you a stomach ulcer. There is no reason to feel like you're missing out -yet-, the game isn't released. No one has made any progress, so there's no progress to have been missed out on. That's how I see it, anyway.
---
Not going to tell people what to do or what to believe, but anyone that expected a 'summer' release to be earlier than july (and even thats being generous) is out to lunch. especially with blizzard's 'soon' history.

this is not, and never will be, nsfw. ffs

fuck, remember having to actually cc mobs in a trash pack instead of aoe nuking everything. best memory is not from vanilla though but tbc i think. you had to use more than 2 marks for trash pulls! it was epic

**About Us**: One Up is a newly created raiding guild with a small core of players who have cleared all classic content and have a vast understanding of the game. We are fully committed to being as efficient as possible.We are seeking motivated players who are looking for a fun and competitive environment. Our focus will be on clearing content quickly and improving weekly. Our goal is to be one of the top guilds on the server we choose to play on.
---
**Raid Information**: Raid times will be 8:00-11:30 EST Tuesday/Thursday. We firmly believe that all 40 man content can be cleared in two days. With that being said we may add a third night to progression weeks in order to speed up the farm process if necessary. 20 Mans Will be done on off night weekly. Our loot system will be loot council that will take rank,performance,and attendance into consideration.
---
**Recruitment**: We are currently accepting all classes
---
Feel free to message me with any questions here or my discord at outcastcloud#6996

......you do know there was a ton of PS before that and a huge community before that. Not only that if no one played Nos no one would of cared. It is cause of the community that this exist. Yes the nos developers were great and did a ton to help but there already was a community before that
---
There is more to life than WoW. Leeroy Jenkins was the biggest thing directly related to vanilla because it is HUMOR that even some non-gamers appreciated. They even added the “Jenkins” title to the game, and made him a legendary card in Hearthstone. The “moar dots” onyxia raid video was another one that transcended the game a little bit and trumps any of the things you listed as “worthy of fame” in cultural significance.
---
There is no good profession for hunter. I would go for herbalism + alchemy because it offers atleast something beneficial while leveling. Or maybe no profession. Leatherworking and engineering are both money sinks and both will offer close to nothing before level 60.
---
July 16 🤔
---
If you have a half priced books by you, it'd be worth checking out. There's a chance they could have some of the original wow guides for pretty low prices. I vaguely remember having the WoW Atlas, Brady Games Guide to WoW &amp; the Brady Games Dungeon Guide. Wish I hadn't gotten rid of mine a few years ago now, I had them nicely tabbed out.
---
LOL, I know, there have been great people in the community who have always worked hard and wanted blizzard classic. And then there are whiny entitled Bratz like you who want their weekly updates. There is a difference.
---
And Chuck Norris heard you, since you wrote his name without capital letters. And yes, he can hear what you wrote.
---
Problem is it wasn't unique. Artifacts sucked because literally you and *every other person in the game* with your spec had the same weapon.
---
Dumbest shit I’ve seen on reddit today. Never make another contribution again
---
Is the show on Spotify? What’s it called?
---
I'm 30 with a family and I forewarned everyone, I'm on vacation that initial week.
---
What I find very interesting about how stat budget works in Vanilla is that the more of a stat you already have, the more it costs to add that stat.
---
The most simple example is how a green item "of Stamina" can have +10 stam, while the same item "of the Bear" will have +6 stam / +6 str
---
Some mail and plate items from the nightmare dragons have an insane total amount of stats spread out on like 6-7 different stats. Whereas there's a ring from Naxx that has nothing but agility, and the number isn't impressive compared to other more balanced rings.
---
It's u/Khetonah work
---
I agree with you to an extent. And maybe it's that constant fluctuation that causes the "Fresh" rush. I play on uthers last name and when the fresh server hit, the previous one died in a week. I hope most think like you and stick around, because honestly it's what I want to do, but i am cautious about what a Fresh seasonal climate could cause to people who want to keep going with a healthy population on their home server.
---
I'm very proud to say that my wife is in that Fountain Valley Fry's Electronics clusterfuck (this was before we dated/got married).
---
You would think counterspell would fuck them up but they have a talent to give 15% chance to resist silence for the entire group and don't suffer spell pushback either.
---
I already called it. They're going to announce you need an internet connection to play. Maybe they'll also say something like horde and alliance are at war or cant speak to each other... ground breaking shit.
---
In game music only.
---
Nothing puts me there like the opening of the Stormwind theme.
---
Yes I am a brat for wanting an update? For wanting an open development cycle with the community as it should be? If you didn't notice they have already made changes to the phase cycle cause of community feedback. But hey I want the best for the project. Guess that makes me a brat
---
I will one up you. Going to announce 8 races and 9 classes and horde will only be allowed shamans and alliance paladins

Its probably 40/60 waiting/ not coming back. My wife is in group somewhere.

* **Focus:** Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, low lifes and no-lifes. 
---
* **Scheduling:** Raids are planned for Tuesday and Wednesday from 1930-2300 EST every two weeks. This will allow us to smash two raid lockouts back to back and then get back to PvP, farming, dungeon running, and general buffoonery for two weeks. 
---
* **Loot:** DKP. Points are awarded for boss kills and being online at the rally point (Kargath for Tiers 1 and 2) a minimum of ten minutes prior to Raid time. DKP is wiped at the start of each content phase to keep people from hoarding points in the weeks leading up to content release. 
---
* **Leadership:** Last played Retail at the start of Cata. Adults with no tolerance for wasting the group's time.
---
* **Membership:** Seeking people with a goals-based mindset who want to be in Azeroth to escape the overbearing culture of politics and memery that has invaded all videogames this past decade. It does not matter if you are a MAGApede, a Hilldawg, a Bernout, a Fascist, or a Communist. Literally none of that has any business being aired out in a video game. Can you activate spells at the right time and get out of cleave range? Awesome, you're hired. RP is encouraged, but mostly we're looking for people that can separate real life from their escapist hobbies.

Playing a TBC server now and 100% addicted to it and loving every minute. This server is amazing. I'm honestly not sure what I will do with Classic drops, kind of dreading it. I know the population will take a nose dive but I'm so invested in it now. I'm debating trying to play both at the same time.
---
Prepare for the downvotes. Anything sharding related is insta death.
---
Committing to a scheduled timeslot can be difficult, but its 100% necessary for real progression. The game has always been like that though. In Vanilla/TBC you'd straight up never get gear pugging and would commit to like 4-5 hours on a raid night. Raiding is waaaaay more accessible now than it was back then.
---
A lot of people in my guild pre-plan their work shifts around when we're raiding. I'd argue if a guild raids on weekdays in the evenings, its actually easier to make time than playing sporadicly throughout the week. Unless you're working at a bar/restaurant which doesn't have set shifts (so a shitty bar/restaurant) its just a matter of how much you want it.
---
And here I am starting an undead mage. I can't wait to get to the barrens.

I played WoW from Beta till TBC launch. I've cleared everything up till Naxx and hit rank 12 in PVP. Now that I am full on adulting I don't have the same amount of time available to play, but I'm looking to enjoy this great game again with a solid and mature community. I am interested in playing resto and feral druid.
---
PM me if you think we would be a good fit.
---
Reality, some of the people who're currently super hyped to play Classic are going to get bored after a month.
---
Level 1-12s cant use legendary weapons.
---
It's pretty much all down to phasing and how they've setup the servers to work with the modern wow player handling.
---
Old WoW had a dedicated server for each continent, and then a server handling instances/bgs etc. This hasn't been the case in modern WoW since phasing was introduced.
---
So did I. Thanks for posting.
---
Totally there with you, waiting to no-life Classic and ignore everything else that i can
---
Eh, you tried.
---
Well I graduated HS in 2005 and started my freshman year of college in 2005 so there’s that.
---
+15 DKP for keeping auto attack on skill bar 1st slot
---
Requires level 120?
---
Looks like classic will be a success as no-one will be weilding this to spoil it.
---
I rest my case. I feel your pain, bro. I feel. Your. Pain. Those binding droprates are fucking abysmal.
---
Didn't realize I could upload it to Spotify. The show is called Nostalgiaholics and I'll look into uploading it to Spotify
---
Haha I'm glad someone noticed that
---
I can totally still sit and play for 4 hours easily.  It just has to be 4 hours between 9pm and 1am.
---
Ha-ha-ha-ha (I'm sharding my laughs)
---
I also like the sell price ;)
---
You seriously don't have the whole world map and points of interest tattooed across your whole body? Noob.
---
Your expectation for the frequency of updates is that which makes you a whiny sod.
---
They will update us when they have news.
---
Agree - I remember so many people complaining in cata that stuff was too hard.  Personally I really liked cata, those early dungeons were actually difficult right as you dinged until you got some blues.
---
That dude is wrong. A hunter wilh a chrommag Xbow, t2, and the zg class trinket has some of the highest burst in game vs clothies.

Good hunters are freakin terrifying in pvp. The thing is there's a ton of absolute garbage hunters out there.
---
You can buy this from google for free.
---
Bloodvine set only becomes available once ZG releases, if you're planning on playing on release and are going to level tailoring, try to aim for robe of the void instead.
---
Pahahahahahaha, that sounds like a solid plan 🤣
---
Warlocks also have the option to 'dps' but are mainly required to tank TE's.
---
Lmao. 
---
Thank you for my fav post of the day.
---
YES thank you.  Been trying to explain to people that face stabbing was fixed in late beta vanilla.  It was NEVER a thing on live.
---
Yeah nah, want something on good old paper thanks.
---
Looks are it. The thing is some of the 1.4 unarmoured mounts were incredible looking. Most notable are the ivory and mottled red raptors.
---
Sweet. I'll use my Thunderfury in my mainhand, and that thing in my offhand. Thanks much!
---
Lol damn dude, those Twins are always interrupting fights, requiring warlocks to tank them all the time.
---
Except the first couple levels of bags from vendors is relatively cheap so it's easy to get all 6-8 slot bags without needing to rely on drops.
---
It takes about 400,000 xp to get to lvl 60 from lvl 58. At 50k/hr that's 8 hours. Even at a very low 15g/hour that's 120g.
---
I had fun at the start of cata, but by the time firelands launched my guild officers and myself were very, very overworked trying to get people through content. In retrospect I don't the content was too hard, per se,  but that classes had changed so much people had a hard time adjusting.
---
I don't know, if I play Alliance I will get Dal'Rends regardless, and as Horde I'm not even using swords. Don't really see the point.
---
You shouldn't suffer from it, but fact of it all is that there are new challenges, because the tech has changed.
---
Biggest disappointment. I’m still in the fence about even getting it.
---
They owe you nothing. Relax.
---
I basically did this back in the day. Good luck and Godspeed.
---
I feel stupid, I can read English, but I still don't understand this post. I'm absolutely lost.
---
God thanks you my son. We all thank you!
---
Did you play it back in Vanilla days?
---
This puts into words what I’ve been feeling this entire expansion. This is the most I’ve ever played WoW since cataclysm and I can not name a single piece of my gear right now. Even in cata I played for the last two months doing arena to get my cataclysmic gear but I knew I had to run Dragon Soul to get Gurgthalak Voice of the Deeps, in WotLK I had to run ICC to get ramaldni blade of culling and oxheart then shadowmourne. In BC it was glaives for my rogue. Shit I was 6 years old when I was playing vanilla and I still remember all the weapons I got on my paladin in order. I feel like you raid now to get stats, not gear. None of the gear actually feels unique. Finding a Kang the Destroyer in arathi highlands after rocking corpsemaker was an experience, getting +5 ilvl on the same sword in two mythics; is not progress to me
---
You just assumed DW fury was how people level, which it isn't. 
---
&gt; Sounds like someone's ego was bruised.
---
I'm not the one writing a wall of text due to insecurity.
---
Try messaging MrGM on twitter or when he's streaming as he will be able to check for you since he has access to the client and model viewer etc.
---
nobody knows
---
I agree. I've played on a pserver a bit and the first two dungeons I tanked with my warrior I had to ask the priests to stop bubbling me on every pull. That's a bit nitpicky, but there seems to be this assumption that because the game came out a long time ago everyone has actually learned how to play it, when that isn't true. Just as many people are asking where Mankrik's wife is, and not all of it is a joke.
---
You're welcome.
---
Speaking of sounds, can't wait to have that old gun sound back. I was also saddened to see that they changed the cheap shot sound effect in retail when I logged in recently.
---
It felt like that momentarily for me; I still want to solely play on Blizzard Classic servers when they drop, but part of me is just enjoying the experience on PServers until the release of Classic.
---
I'm not going too hard on the PServer because I know it'll be a complete afterthought when Classic arrives, and that I won't be logging into that server any longer. Because of that, I'm just enjoying doing some silly meme style leveling and dungeons in the interim.
---
Someone on the sub printed out a levelling guide he got online along with the dungeon info stuff and put it all in a binder. Looked pretty good.
---
He's a meme. Makes a ton of content, but it's generally bad. He's also not a good player (watched him do some 60 duels).
---
I can almost smell the fresh air of the early morning hours looking at this... 
---
or maybe I‘m just remembering the summer nights spent playing this wonder of a game
---
Hey thanks for the heads up. I was using the Rogue spell costs by accident. I just reuploaded a fixed version. Also on the initial upload a bad version of the 3rd page got in which I fixed. Now the correct spells should be listed 42-60.
---
I also added the talents for Blast  Wave and Pyro and the adjusted cheaper costs for those and for Ice Barrier. I also removed some abilities on the tail end of the levels because I found out they are actually from farmable tombs at end game. 
---
Again thank you!
---
Somewhere beyond the grave. Phillip Seymour Hoffman just Sharded
---
Jokes on you classic is just the rerelease of bfa.
---
Problematic. Hunter arrow sound was the new one not the old one. I expect they had a lot of fixes to do
---
 Hello,  Name:  **Exiled**   Semi-Hardcore 
---
Region/Raid Time: NA - Eastern Standard Time with 2-3 raid days for progression and gear  6:30 - 9PM + EST  Server Type: PVP  
---
Faction: 📷 Horde 📷   
---
Priorities: Raid First, PvP second but we like the construct of the ability for open PvP.  
---
Discord: We do have our own discord, PM if  you are interested   
---
Rules/About Us: Currently, we are a mature group of men and women. It's a discord where there is freedom of discussion of whatever topics and many of us have known each other for literally 15+ years. Some in this discord are family members and good friends. We have roughly 3 people who will be playing Classic WoW here with the launch expected 4-6 Months(Summer of 2019) 
---
 The roles of what ever class and profession are open but it looks like we may be hurting for Druids,  healers and hunters. In our discord we breakdown everyone's committed profession, race and class. Whisper if you are interested and I will get you the discord information or ask addition questions.   Thank you!
---
No changes
---
Off the top of my head I'll tell you that (IF leveling frost) you only need:
---
Frostbolt
---
Conjured foods
---
Blizzard
---
CoC
---
rank 1 frost nova
---
Evocation
---
Frost/Ice Armor
---
Mage armor
---
Teleport and Portal obviously
---
Blink
---
All the other spells are personal preference /subjective.
---
I tend to favor buying more spells because I plan to be on a PVP server and will dabble in wPVP as I level
---
i sure hope so
---
Blessed blade of the burn this motherfucker down.
---
Thats a pretty bullshit excuse as to why people didn't do the end game content.
---
Hoodoo / badwater TF2
---
Because I like both? Or is this sub just for circle jerking?
---
I hope they pay attention to what made osrs successful. Voting on new content so we can shut stupid shit down. Voting for only level 60s.
---
If you just respec for pvp they're basically gods with hand of rag. Even without it they're pretty great, but since it's pretty much a pvp weapon anyway and they make the most use out of it...
---
People can't come to realization that BFA isn't hard... they want to feel good about themselves lmfao.
---
When the game is actually streamable I'm sure it will.
---
I appreciate the feedback, im stuck between wanting a mage or priest for classic. Been looking at all different things for both. Thank you :-)
---
The game would be dead then after the last raid and patch is completed.
---
Shadow Priest and SL Lock are the two hardest match-ups for hunters. Both just have too much HP to be bursted down and do too much consistent damage to survive with stamina stacking.  
---
Frost mages aren't great to duel and there's not much I can specifically say except know your class and how to position and kite, because if you are a newb they will just rape you. But they take high damage from hunters, can be oomed sometimes and they are susceptible to ganking as you out range them.
---
I'll rank all the opponents but with these caveats:
---
\-Things have changed over the past 15 years with the advent of mass engineering and shit like rocket helm and stun trinket: [http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/344688-on-vanilla-pvp/](http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/344688-on-vanilla-pvp/)
---
\-My experience was far from the average: [https://i.imgur.com/x7OznJH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/x7OznJH.jpg)
---
\-This is from a 15 year old memory
---
**Easy**
---
Rogue: Easiest, once I hit my gear peak I could literally just melee most rogues to death.
---
Warriors: Easy, just kite/trap, could even melee shitty ones to death cheesing bandage and traps.
---
Regular priest: They just don't do enough damage.
---
Enh Shaman: Kite.
---
Feral druid: No damage.
---
**Med**
---
Fire mage: You can burst them and with enough stamina you can just survive their burst.
---
Pally: Kite, but you need room, you're basically fucked by a prot pally with thunderfury, as there was one in my first guild, Drama. Though but in the wild they probably can't ever catch you.
---
Ele Shaman: Became friends cross faction with with best one on the server and we dueled often but my characters high stamina + Aspect of the Wild + the NR from my NE passive and items like Cloak of the Shrouded Mists raped him. I out geared him though so I think the average hunter might have been fucked.
---
Frost mage: Hard to say for sure, there really wasn't a frost mage with gear comparable to mine on my server. Early on, before I was decked, there was a strong PVPer on my server named Liquid Ice and we dueled a lot but I got the best of him. He did make 2 PVP videos though, which I posted, and there are a ton of clips of him raping other hunters.
---
**Hard**
---
Resto Druid: Dueled my good friend and usual heal-bot "Tigerlady," a multi rank1 druid, a lot and basically I needed a lucky string of crits to win. Restos will slowly grind you down and you will have a bunch of attempts for a string but realistically you will probably only get one per every 3 duels.
---
**No chance**
---
Shadowpriest: There was a guild-mate in DnT that loved to duel and he just consistently owned me. Spriests are as hard to kill as druid but they just kill you 3x as fast as a druid so you just have less chances to string some crits so usually you just die.
---
SL lock: There wasn't really a crazy lock PVPer that I dueled all the time but even mid tier ones were a problem and you can ask basically any high-tier hunter and he will tell you the match-up is fucked.
---
Lmfao "oh i cant pull this much its too hard for me let me quit"... Literally what you just said. You obviuolsy dont know what APM means, dont use words you cant use properly in a sentence.
---
True, but stoneskin just doesn't remove poisons, it makes you immune for 8 seconds.
---
That means no mindnubbing or crippling poison. No deep wounds, rend, garrote, etc.
---
I think a few big streamers have sent in that exact request to Twitch, not to mention that it does make sense to split up WoW into two sections since Classic and Retail is not the same game. So yeah I think it will happen.
---
I didn't know about /u/Seguren and his version. He did a great job on that one. I specifically made mine to be printable on 8.5x11 though and wanted it to be in multiple pages.
---
OP put in his days off for the rest of the year today. Tomorrow Blizzard will announce the release date just to spite OP since he won't be able to change his days off.
---
Whats really braindead is you...
---
Week long av would never be a thing with our knowledge now. Stop being dramatic.
---
Players are so much better and we all know the strats. No matter what patch of av we got you'd still rush base.
---
Simple as that. Avs would never ever go even remotely that long today, most wouldn't even last an hour, most would be done in 30 min
---
considering a large part of the d3 team moved over to wow during WoD it is no surprise. Legion already shows their influence and now we are in world of D3 - but the crappy yellow items with random stats BiS version of it
---
6 months after naxx the final patch “Extinction of Azeroth” will be released. This patch will get rid of the ability to revive, both from the spirit healer and spells. The horde and alliance will have one final epic battle to determine which faction is supreme.
---
Of the survivors of the winning side, one individual will randomly be given a magical elixir and a choice: either the consume the elixir and revive all players/return the ability to Rez to Azeroth for both factions, or use the elixir on Mankriks Wife, who will now be an engaging npc with all new vast questlines/rep items/arena queuing/etc. for the survivors.
---
Bless whoever made it nsfw lmao
---
You can use your vacation to travel to blizz hq and lob flaming backs of shit over the fence in protest...just a thought.
---
You ever read the dailey quests for the stompeak giants in wrath?
---
"Polish the tip?"
---
I fully agree. I would love to see them keep the classic WoW talent tree and never add LFG for PvE or flying mounts. I would like to see like small expansions that differ from the main game and stay true to the classic vibe
---
They didnt say first zone. They said they'll use it if needed (it will be) but only on the first few zones. They never said to what level ranges. Could be just 1-5, could be 1-10, could be 1-20 the first two zones
---
ud starting zone and silverpine is my favorite 1-18 route
---
Do it! You can definitely cut tons of costs from skipping on the non-essential skills.
---
Don't worry it will be when classic comes out and every single popular streamer will be playing and it's #1on twitch.
---
Hybrid Theory - Linkin Park
---
Hoping for May announcement July release but realistically I’m expecting a June announcement with an August release being unlikely and the more probable release being September.
---
This is the strategy for happiness. Low expectations coupled with high gratitude when things come through.
---
Gotta love Anthony Anderson.

Like how you wash your car and it rains the next day? He had to put in vacation time for the summer and now the release date is (not actually) gonna be released tomorrow.
---
It's not funny
---
I posted this to another user but: 
---
&gt; Off the top of my head I'll tell you that (IF leveling frost) you only need: Frostbolt, Conjured items, Blizzard, CoC, rank 1 frost nova, Evocation, Frost/Ice Armor,Mage armor, Teleport and Portal obviously and Blink.
---
I tend to favor buying more spells because I plan to be on a PVP server and will dabble in wPVP as I level. &gt;
---
Posts about it shouldnt be downvoted instantly, but I think the vast MAJORITY agrees with the fact, that PERMANENT sharding is cancerous and is everything that vanilla wow wasnt.
---
Even if it was 100% accurate replication of Vanilla, with sharding it would feel like meh at best, its a WORLD of warcraft i fell in love with, not small parts of it.
---
Wow this is very insightful!! I greatly appreciate all of the advice and teachings.
---
Pretty sure you’re just illiterate. Thanks for making it clear.
---
The precedent is there with Runescape and OSRS. I only wonder who it is that makes this decision. Is it up to Blizzard, or does Twitch decide based on community demand when to create a new category for something like this? My only concern is that if Blizzard can veto as separate Classic channel then there is a good chance they  may, since forcing them together would tend to inflate the rankings for WoW and conceal how popular Classic is vs. retail.
---
You don't have to take my word for it, it's in black and white in the Mueller report. You should read it sometime instead of relying on the fox news summary
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
By the light I hope you are correct.
---
Wasnt it announced last year..? How have we been waiting for over a year an a half??
---
So making a joke makes you an asshole now, huh?
---
I'm a cheapskate though.  /r/Frugal 
---
gotta save for that level 40 mount.
---
Once it's past it's prime again, I can see TBC being next on the list, as this will keep their sub counts up and money flying in. As long as they ask us first I'm fine with going all the way to WoTLK, but no further.
---
Where do you people come up with this shit seriously? It's like a bad millennial x-files episode.
---
Axe Spec's description is wrong.
---
They will announce the date within the week.          
---
The date will be August 20th.
---
Retail needs an option to see real day and night cycles and weather. Definitely some of the "smaller" parts of classic I miss the most.
---
Announcement late june, release mid august!
---
So because you didnt like the video that means the millions of other people who enjoyed it have invalid opinions?
---
Get off your high horse, humor is like music, everyone enjoys different stuff.
---
&gt; "It was in a book"
---
I hate this so much. I went on a reading spree when classic was announced. You wouldn't believe how much lore is locked away in the books that are out of print and hard to find. Not the mention the comics.
---
I like how you used your walkman into your PC microphone for the music &gt;.&gt;
---
I don't understand why that's relevant, in the first five words you basically stated this was irrelevant.
---
I mean in the last 12 hours, there were like 5 exactly the same threads. So tomorrow i should write a long essay of why it against this. For now however i will say this.
---
Different  devs, different vision. Vanilla content was relevant for it's whole  life mostly because of not so much catch up mechanics. Itemization was  HORRID but it actually helped the game by making it relevant and heavily  boosting the RPG element.
---
Now  im supposed to trust current blizzard to release new content, which  will require even harder work than Retail? Nah sorry. Making horrid  items to be in check with the items of old will require something i  would only trust the team from 2005.
---
One  mistake and they might turn the game into "level to 60, do this new  content and never do anything else but naxx". I already have PTSD from  the times ToC and IC  dungeons got released, making the rest pointless  and braindead easy.
---
So  no, i dont want anything. But since this is yet another "my opinion  wont hurt the game" i'd go with seasonal server restarts each 3 years.
---
I  mean i already see "blizz we want vanilla" if they go that way... Just  release it and with or without restarts, just let it eventually die out.  If there is MUCH success, give TBC servers to those who want, but be  careful not to split the community too thin, because that will  definitely kill both.
---
What's the point of classic if you start changing it?
---
Lets say that this team, who is different,  with different vision starts making changes. You start giving ideas,  and you get the polls going. you get 70% for that and 30% against that.  Multiply this by every time they decide  that it's time for additions.
---
Just  release the game and let it die with dignity. Making them work on 2  different MMOS while they can't even fix their damn Retail sounds  ludicrous.
---
Thing  is, everyone in their mind think that they found the perfect solution,  but at the same time someone else disagrees. Do i trust a company that  drove me to want Classic in the first place with actually keeping the  vanilla spirit with new content? Well...no.
---
I’m fine with them adding stuff like TBC or WoTLK, but I’d like to see them stray off path a little. I think that everything after phase 6 should be polled by the community
---
TBC
---
What's wrong with troll?
---
Checks out, 27 now, 28 at launch.
---
No. We need to eliminate twinking because I don't twink and I don't want some overgeared level 19 killing me while I'm questing.
---
Also, Stranglethorn Vale should NOT be contested. It should be a no PvP zone.
---
It's so unfair!
---
You actually don't get the joke behind this?
---
I'm pretty sure those that liked doing Project 60, 70 and 80 can't do it any more cause its all broken (raids to easy/gear worthless)
---
I just came to that realization a few days ago. I was not having fun farming for gold on a server with a dead economy so I took a long hard look at what I am hoping to get out of playing on one of those severs. 
---
Now I'm having fun trying other classes, races, professions to figure out if I want to play something different on Day 1 of Classic.
---
Every point you made is basically disproven by the success of Old School Runescape. They’re different games and WoW is much more complicated, but I think it could work. 
---
If it comes out that they’re just making vanilla and then letting it die, I definitely won’t be playing it. From the people I’ve spoken to that are excited for it, it’s to play through vanilla and then have a “new” start with blizz fucking up less often than how retail played out
---
It will absolutely be enough to make me quit. They already (probably) ruined the epicness of AV, and ruined city roads with stupid DH kills, if you can’t even do large scale world fights in Crossroads/Ashenvale/Tarren Mill then PVP is ass and fuck the game as a whole.
---
More. Now.
---
I had Ashjre'thul on an Orc male and I don't remember the animation being notable, so I don't think it was bad at all. I liked all of the weapon animations iirc, but none blew me away or anything.
---
Blizzard servers have always been absolute garbage when it comes to large PvP battles. It's really sad that some third-party was able to make more capable servers than a billion dollar company.
---
So the date on which Classic's release date is announced to the world........
---
I'm going with Tuesday, May 21st.
---
They have to do something after phase 6, or else they'll just bleed subscribers.
---
Amazing guide man! Would doing a run of SM set you back pretty far? Also a full run of Ulda for the chance at the weapons?   
---
Also, do you plan on doing an ability usage breakdown video for rotational stuff?
---
Last time I was totally submersed in WoW was when I was playing on a vanilla pserv that was shut down a few years back. I only got to level 10 or so but holy shit was I having fun. I totally expect that to be the case in Classic.
---
Back when games were made by nerds for nerds.
---
I can often play for those hours, just not non-stop. I might need to put dinner away for 5 minutes, or put the laundry in the dryer, or I may just want to eat a snack, or spend an hour watching a show and then back to gaming, or who knows what. It's the freedom to do various things that will be hard to give up. Even just starting to game at say 8:30 or 9 because maybe I took longer to do something in my routine one night.
---
Part of me thinks that eventually I'll get to a point where I'll raid with the guild casually when I can and do other things like BGs most of the time (in addition to leveling and gearing a Pally I already plan on making at some point). Things that I can do for a bit and take a break if need be then come back.
---
Dont get me wrong it's great but they color scheme and sounds of death/moaning all the time are getting to me haha
---
but k3 came out after the classic announcement
---
According to the OP, WoW didn't come to Russia until 2008 so that's probably when many of these people started playing.
---
&gt;The Devs added watered down game modes so that players who aren’t good at RPGs can follow the story,
---
Worst mistake they made. Catering to everyone = boring game.
---
Thank you for answering.
---
Try moderation!!! You can do it
---
Ive played both PVP and PVE server back in vanilla. So i am getting abit long in the tooth for Classic. I will be rolling PVE server this time around. However PVP server is fun but also bloody frustrating at times. 
---
Im going for a more relaxing semi-hardcore experience this time around. Never know i might also roll on a PVP server just for the hell of it down the line but at start it will be a PVE server.

Probably for you th

No way I'm buying a laptop with a decent gaming tower already built, but this thread is seriously tempting me to install wow on my old vaio, drop the video settings to potato, and seeing what melts first. This will immensely increase gaming time as wife watches 'flix on the couch next to me.
---
Yes because random BGs are the home of brilliant tactics and teamwork. 
---
It’d be a shit show with the stronger and more numerous NPCs, and it would be glorious.
---
Most zones on BfA are roughly as dark as they were back in Vanilla. There's also weather effects in almost every zone, maybe not as intense as they should be but there's a couple zones where it's really well done.
---
The game isn't even released yet and there are complete legends cruising around on Reddit.
---
Yeah i would 100% wait at 12pm at my local gamestop snacking on cheetos and downing mountain deq in anticipation.  I really really hope they release a collectors edition sometime i would def purchase. Maybe some artwork etc
---
Mulgore is just the best! So cozy.
---
Check out "tips out" on YouTube. He has a good video just about this topic. If I'm not mistaken, a priest is a very good and a terrible combo if you're the enemy :)
---
Honestly I didn't think there was anyone who would find Classic to be very difficult, due to the sheer level of unmitigated inability to perform basic functions that such a feat would require. However, you've made me a believer.  
---
After listening to your struggles, I know it will be hard for you, but I'll be cheering you on. Good luck in Classic.
---
DAE dislike BFA?!?!?!!?
---
July 16th
---
Why was that good again?
---
&gt;  Now that I saw it’s only a couple of months away
---
How optimistic :)
---
It would be cool if it did.  I won't hold my breath, but there was so much that was unexplored in the old world, or locations that teased content and were never used.  Like that gate by the demons in Winterspring, or the Grim Batol in the Wetlands.  So many factions that just felt incomplete (ravenholdt). 
---
Would be cool to see them expand the world in a different way rather than making everything in the old world irrelevant with TBC.
---
May 14th announced, release will be July 16th.
---
Yea I use those a lot. I wish it was a re-usable toy!
---
Population imbalance is what gives a faction dominance. You ganking people doesn’t do anything.
---
Honestly thought it was a poem at first as well :P
---
Happy Cake Day btw. :)
---
lmfao you had to delete your first reply to make another one just as bad? Geez la weez people on here are pathetic, and my struggles? lmfao what you going on about? Its a fact 100% BFA is 100x easier than classic is and will be. BFA is easy as fuck in every aspect compared to vanilla.
---
The subreddit should have a twitch channel, just a 24-hour stream of the classic forums blue tracker page, with audience participation where they can send commands in chat to refresh the page.
---
That's why I'm playing a TBC pserver, so I don't burn myself out on the endgame
---
You only need tailoring for the +2% crit set bonus with the bloodvine set, anyone can equip it.
---
Honestly though, the last post was almost zero new information
---
Great post. 
---
I was listening to Totalbiscuit's first episode of "Blue Plz" a few weeks ago and he was reading forums and viewer comments about how unfair PvP was. This perplexing paradigm of people selecting existence on a realm where they can be attacked...and then complaining about being attacked...goes all the way back to the beginning of the game.
---
Exactly! Hence, why it is up to us regular folk to do our part and chip in where the Alliance military is falling short
---
I think the type of player you described should roll on a PVE server and go to gurubashi arena whenever they feel like it. Maybe the world pvp objectives of the last phase would also cater to this player base? Do you have any other idea?
---
Just out of curiosity, were you using Shadow Oil, Dragonsbreath Chili and Seal of Righteousness?
---
Yeah, different games, differen studios. etc etc etc... Id like to see which part of OSRS disproved people's trust issues in blizzard.
---
If you don't mind show me point by point how osrs disproves what i said. 
---
Also it will take a LOOOONG time for Classic to die. So don't worry, you are very well likely to have these servers going as long as WoW as a whole exists.
---
May i also ask you to guide me step by step, how OSRS having a success relates to Classic RPG, balance and items being a COMPLETE MESS, that is pretty much why the content was relevant all the time? Having this in mind, i really would like you to explain to me how a completely new team keeps that in mind without destroying half the content with one wrong set?
---
Look, all you did was taking the way of less resistance "OSRS disproves what you said". How exactly it did so?
---
I mean do you get OSRS team to work on Classic? Bring the 2004 team back to start working on WoW again?
---
Somehow convincing blizzard to work on 2 separate MMO-s, something they said will be avoided.
---
I wish i lived in your world seriously, a world where you point at a great game and say "Hey look, that game did it, so can you". Man, wouldn't that be great?  
---
Cheers, just because Joe did it, doesn't mean James can do it too. Neither did i ask them to do anything. If you are so scared of what you are going to do 3 years down the line, just quit, don't tell me how OSRS being a success (wonder how many think so though) means WoW has or CAN follow suit.

&gt;"might is right", and only power has the last word

Blizzard had a PvP harassment policy. As of BfA it has been changed to "Just turn off battle mode", but before they made sweeping changes for the purpose of eliminating GM activity, and before they got rid of PvP servers, they had a detailed policy stating that continued harassment via PvP was indeed a punishable offense and a GM could intervene.
---
Also +10 levels higher should not be able to kill the lowbies, ganking is basically internet bullying!!
---
Oh and do city raids
---
Where did I assume that people level DW fury? Do you understand how "and" works in boolean algebra? I said you need hit gear AND full talents (meaning fully leveled). "And" means that both what comes before it and after it must be true at the same time.
---
Translation: This means that optimally, you should not level fury DW or 2H. (Especially, I would not as one of the slowest leveling classes.)
---
Hence, your error in reading comprehension if you think I somehow stated "DW fury was how people level."
---
You didn’t notice the animation because you were too busy staring at the huge numbers your Ashjre’thul was doing. I hope I have the same issue
---
maybe they meant spending your summer speculating about classic on the internet
---
Was this the launch for the original game (aka November 23 2004)?
---
I mean you pretty much have to; there's no way you can make enough gold to train every rank of every ability while leveling, unless you get super lucky with world drop BoEs or go out of your way to farm stuff.
---
wow pre-made BGs i guess that's the end of the entire game then because there's nothing else to do
---
Very good job! I like what you did with the talents. Looks very clean and tidy.
---
I really Wish Blizzard would not do this for the first month or so. Going to be so many tourists from retail using up unique names and then never playing the characters after a couple weeks.  I wish the two subs were separate.
---
&gt; Where did I assume that people level DW fury? 
---
Because you wrote that fury wasn't good before you started getting hit.
---
I took the first comment as a serious comment. I don't care about any jokes made. I was looking for a serious answer.
---
I took off from work from june 17th till august 6... If it doesn't hit within that huge time window I don't know what I'll do..
---
Me too!!!
---
Except LFR players won't ever be equal to mythic raiders. The item level difference is there. And please don't act like titanforging is guaranteed. Even then, iirc it's capped.
---
I just avoid talking about wow in general. I feel shame honestly. Guess I'm a closet undead priest
---
An ex-GM did an AMA recently where [he spoke about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/beb974/i_was_a_game_master_during_vanilla_wow_ask_me/eld845b/)
---
&gt;I was a big PvP player myself, so I was always on the side of leave PvP on PvP servers alone. In general this was the stance. If someone were being corpse camped I would offer them advice on how I may approach it, without telling them what to do.
---
&gt;The way to turn PvP into harassment was in circumventing rules in some way to do. For example if you had an opposite faction friend telling you where someone was so you could corpse camp them, that is crossing a line that isn't meant to naturally happen in WoW. Once it started to break that barrier it was no longer normal PvP.
---
You misspelled Mountain Dick.
---
Bro. Please leave your parents basement. You'll be better off.
---
I used to joke about how WoW was becoming more and more like Diablo with each expansion but these days I think Diablo III is actually more complex than BFA.
---
It's not an excuse, it's actually what happened. I know because I was a guild leader at the time and watched everyone around me either quit until BC came out or opted to play more casual because they didn't like the idea of gear being obsolete right as they got it. Naxx was released in June 06 and BC was projected for November 06. We didn't know it got pushed back until late October, so people had to decide how they were going to spend the remaining 4-5 months. A lot of people didn't think it was worth it.
---
People on the official forums at the time also lamented it was harder to raid for similar reasons.
---
Any healer, doesn't matter which one so you can feed him mana while he kills shit.
---
You'll more than make up the spent silver with all the crap you can carry and vendor :p Like I think the 6 slot bags are 6 silver or something.
---
What if they simply don’t have anything to report? We know almost everything except a release date. They may be working towards one internally but until they can for sure make it we won’t hear about it. I also really enjoy the slight threatening tone of your post, like you’ll hold them accountable for not giving us any information this week. Just relax man.

30+ member core with experience full clearing MC, BWL, AQ40, and Naxx. Best clear times were \~50 minute MC, 90 minute BWL, 2.5 hour AQ40 and all 4 wings of Naxx in 3.5 hours.
---
Guilds in WoW have a variety of goals. No single guild will ever fit every person’s play style, social needs, or progression goals. The core of Pretty Good has found that we value playing together and growing as a group more than any other element of this game. Make no mistake, clearing multiple raids in a single night and killing Kel’Thuzad are the immediate goals of this group. Where we differ is how we choose to pursue this objective.
---
We have an active discord and a diverse and funny group. Some have been playing vanilla WoW together for 5+ years and others are just now finding us as we prepare for Classic. There is something special about vanilla when you find 40 people with a common goal and experience your guild’s progression and achievements together. We are determined to maintain a consistent raid group in Classic who values playing together first and crushing raids second. Clearing PvE content is immensely easier than finding a group you will enjoy playing with for years at a time.
---
If you are interested in joining us and our raid times work for you, make a point to talk to some of our members. Hang out in our Discord for a day or two. We care more about the type of people we play with and their commitment to the group than your ability to lvl quickly, gear or raidstats.
---
We play hard. Consumables are expected and world buffs are strongly encouraged. We all recognize criticism is a necessary ingredient to growth, but there is a clear distinction between constructive criticism and tearing other players down. If you enjoy acting like a child or if you are a child then this guild is not for you.
---
We are always striving to build a finely tuned boss killing machine, and to do that requires constant improvement and accountability. If you choose to spend your time with Pretty Good you will always have to earn your raid spot, but you will be guaranteed a place in our community.

Please tell me how WoW is in any way comparable to WoW? With the little I know about that I game I'm aware it's meant to be difficult and in no way comparable to wow. Nothing is being handed away, you still have to try in LFR and if people are clueless, you will wipe several times. You ever had to set foot in LFR kill jaeden? My guess is no. 
---
Once again, the gating is already there with the other difficulties. Your old regular lfr raider won't be doing as much dps as a mythic raider. Please, make a game and cater it to only people like Method who play it professionally. I'm sure your game will be successful. 
---
Oh and btw, lfr is as hard as vanilla raids. Triggered? :)
---
The gamer Illuminati.
---
What level is stratholme? Is that like a 16 slot?
---
They do though? People talk about it like it’s god mode for warrior but so many mobs have slows or ranged and often terrain and mob density make it very hard to effectively hamstring kite
---
You let me know how it goes when you can't afford training ;)
---
Can we get it on youtube though so I can watch it from work?
---
Twitch is blocked on military computers... bastards.
---
its a reposted meme. actually the originial was made better and this guy just took his idea and made it worse
---
Original. Wish I could upvote twice
---
There used to be a rogue on my old server back in vanilla with Thinderfury, his name was Haunted, and when ever he ran up the hill at us he just fucking laid us out.
---
It doesn't have to be original for it to be true.
---
I didn’t actually think to try that, but overpower is tied to the enemy dodging not the weapon so I would guess it does, will test the next time I’m on
---
I finished high school in 98 so probably around 7 years.
---
Sorry I’m not a fan of your favorite wow video. It’ll be alright
---
60, maybe could go a couple levels early.
---
yes.
---
You got a joke of an answer implying the first comment wasn't serious, that doesn't make anyone an asshole.
---
You missed the joke, simple as that
---
Thanks for the detailed answer, it does help a bit. Is there any that are great in pvp and pve? I'd ideally like to good at both. I dont need to be "top dps" in raids, but i'd like to pull my weight...and then slaughter people in pvp. Haha.
---
How awesome would it be for them to release a "Classic" collectors edition, with the same contents as the original collectors edition, but with different skins on the pet/items to keep the originals special.
---
That's actually a liters of vodka per day chart
---
Shave the beard too. Your mom will think you're so handsome. Or the leg beard if you're a female.  You stroke me as the kind who can't talk to females though.
---
Easily :)
---
Where did they say this?
---
I bought a freaking 10 slot bag for 8g from AH, only to find out they cost like 1g something from vendors. This is why you should have a dry run on private first...
---
Hahahaha yikes. You got me. I concede.
---

Ive done this before. My last warrior never even got a kodo. First mount was a wolf
---
I've played on PvP servers before, and its an absolute blast when its players around your level, but it basically never is. 99% of my world PvP interactions before 60 were being camped by a level 60 Rogue and being blasted by a Frostbolt by a passing level 60.
---
Its super fun at 60. World bosses, killing or getting killed on your way to raids, skrimishes, world defense, etc, it really binds a community together. But the frustration to get to that point just isn't for me.

**About us**: We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
**PvE**: We would like to clear all PvE content in time and hopefully step foot into naxxramas when it launches.
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we would like to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and some battlegrounds later on.
---
Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!

**Recruitment**: We've started building our main raid roster and so far it looks like we only lack paladins and warlocks. Nothing is set in stone though, which is why we're recruiting all classes/roles. We also accept Socials, Casuals and Non-raiders!
---
We do not enforce nor encourage min-maxing and rushing but we do expect our future members to be experienced (or at least a little familiar) with classic wow.
---
If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!
