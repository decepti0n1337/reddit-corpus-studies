That is the downside to two gathering professions, clicking back and forth.  I'm with you though, feral druid miner / herbalist as one alt.  I'll have characters that are alchemists, blacksmiths and engineers to use what I gather.

---
---
Sat on so many Larval Acids with my warrior.   How else does a prot warrior make money?
---
It seems you are the one that is whining, good sir.
---
Excellent point.
---
Third for madseason. He raised with my brother back in vanilla and BC on khadgar in Archaic. Guild leader was Loslos (rogue)
---
&gt;.You're not serious about raiding simply because you care about stuff that ** isn't necessary for progression**.
---

---
Some of it will depend on what exactly is in Classic.  Can I break a Hearthof Fire into Elemental Fires ever in Classic? From day one? After a certain patch?
---
Your best bet is to be self-sufficient.  Don't buy anything.  Have enough alts that you can do your own tradeskills.  Penny saved is a penny earned.
---
Just some food for thought. If you go Shaman/Warlock. Tauren are way better Ele and Resto shamans and just as good as Orcs for Enhance. So it's not practical to say you will start out in the same place.
---
Also you will go to the barrens as soon as you can at level 11-13. So if you play undead warlock. You two can team up like 3 hours into playing. Don't let your brother bully you because of 3 hours. Your class choice is huge and you won't want to reroll as that takes centuries. 
---
Doesn't really change anything. Warlocks' Mana Drain is really weak in vanilla, I don't think it even scales with spell damage. You literally drain more mana by spamming DoTs. And by the time you DoT all enemies and toss out a fear and some other useful buttons, you're basically ready to repeat the whole process.
---
Mana Burn is strong, but that means having the luxury of having time in between spamming heals. This is basically why drain teams worked well in arena's, because resilience and general survivability increases meant that healers didn't have much to fear while DPS cooldowns were down.
---
So, again, in practise it's just going to be a Hunter doing viper stings. The rare times where the Priest can frequently cast Mana Burn, you probably really don't need to be burning anything, because you're evidently winning the fight with ease.
---
Picture too hd 
---
He said in one vid that engineering really has no use. Later after actually reading a guide from someone else he said it's essential for pvp. You would be better off googling for 5 mins than listening to anything he says.
---
I enjoy Esfand, Tipsout, and Staysafe ‘s Classic Casts. Some decent chat about the things to look forward to. Each run their own YouTube channel 
---
&gt;I typically role a gnome warlock though it depends quite honestly. I haven't found a guild yet because the people who I usually roll with are holding off until they're sure Blizzard is going to commit properly. Long story.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If there's sharding I won't be there.  Dynamic respawn? Great, hopefully it'll be temporary. I know it hurts the economy but that's a temporary solution I can get behind. If neither like you said? Blizzard will hopefully have server queues and a wait time for the servers. I'm honestly content to wait it out otherwise because I know what the future will hold. I'd rather wait until the madness passes than take the easy route that'll cause damage in the long term so to speak. Okay so I don't get to play straight away? Good things come to those who wait. That's better for me. Perhaps not for Blizzards PR but for me it is in the long term if it means a system is never implemented and the devs are not going to use it, or be tempted too.  
---
&gt;If I can get in? I'll likely group up to complete quests. That's what worked for me on censored name, censored name, censored name and so on. It sounds farfetched but under the assumption we'll have server queues and you can't all just log in at once. What I've found is that in Coldridge Valley mobs tend to spawn around the edges, usually between my quests I go after them if they're free. Every mob you see you tag. You have to be greedy. If not, group up when I can and try to rush quests. I've honestly never had trouble tagging things. The human area is a different story. Sensible people will do what they can and go grind in Elwynn.  
---
&gt;Usually after Dun Morogh I'm about level 11, some times 12 if I grind it all out and do that bear revenge quest. I could go through it bit by bit but I don't know if that would interest you, it's mostly just picking up quests and making sure to do them in the 'right order' so I don't run back and forth across the map to hand in constantly. Using the hearthstone smartly etc. People underestimate green quests as well in my opinion, I always get every green quest done rather than go to the next area if I can. I never skip them if I can.

---
This is awesome. I might try to get my old screenshots off the old gaming pc

I‘d take some roasted Kodo meat and some Strider stew please, thanks! :-)
---
What realm was this?
---
It is a bug.  Original vanilla wow patched it out.
---
If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault.
---
If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault.
---
If the DPS dies, it's their own damn fault.
---
Lok Tar
---
I haven't really had a bad experience playing a healer on a certain pserver. My only complaint are the tanks that don't pay attention to my mana. I've been in situations where I've wasted mana pots unnecessarily because I wasn't given time to drink.
---

&gt; The Gurubashi Arena was also a place you summoned level 3 players from Durotar with promises of sweet loot only to have them get mercilessly killed and have no means by which to escape their newfound hell.
---
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
---
He played vanilla but he didn't get max level though IIRC
---
But he's falling into that category where everything that he and his pserver buds don't like is terrible. That right report one was the worst thus far
---
&gt;I love arms and warrior in general, but there isn't a single class were supposed to win against leveling in wpvp. 
---
How do you lose against Rogues with an arms warrior?
---
&gt;You probably mean getting a bit less destroyed in pvp. 
---
Not my inexperience.  I had a ball PvPing with my warrior all the way to 60.  I destroyed pretty much everyone outside of frost mages.  In fact I still remember the first really hard fight I had as a warrior.  I ran into a 60 NE marks hunter in WPL @52 and she proceeded to take my 3 man level group apart multiple times.  We eventually worked out how to deal with her kiting, but the final kill count was 7 to 2 in her favor.  Kiting hunters was definitely a new experience for me.
---
Shut up Alliance pussy.

https://www.wowhead.com/title=83/salty
---
Just in case he still doubts it
---
Are there any private server players that don't want progressive itemization?
---
Everyone I talk to is a big proponent for it, but you have people in this thread who think certain items changing stats will be too cumbersome to understand for the Gamer Moms &amp; Pizza Dads out there. 
---
MC, BWL, AQ and Naxx ( 2 days ) will be cleared in one day.
---
I think that was Asmongold. Pretty sure Tips started after Vanilla.
---
&gt; Esports and, Streamers two things classic needs. Like it needs a gunshot to the head.
---
You're being foolish. Streamers especially bring a lot of people in.
---
More people play = Blizzard sees interest and develops Classic TBC/WOTLK.
---
Raserisk has amazing videos covering raid tactics for AQ and the last bosses of Naxx.
---
Raziya has good stuff including a nearly 3h long video that covers everything you'd need to know about soloing Maraudon.
---
Payo is an entertainer more than anything. He doesn't do PVE or BGs but he's pretty good at dueling and most of his content is him fighting 1vx out in the open world.
---
Monkeynews isn't really informative has almost all of his videos are just PVP montages, but there's a lot you can learn from watching him play.
---
you’re forced to be a healer if you want to raid literally nothing else is viable, do not listen to these people who say otherwise as they have never raided vanilla in their lives. gear is competitive cause everyone want a resto sham you’re better off going druid for easy gear. also, you oom very quickly.
---
Another thing to consider is how blizzard approaches population. If they go to the pserver route, which I doubt, we're gonna get a ridiculously changes economy
---
They "understand" other people. Whole new generation. 
---
The future is now old man.
---
Go tailoring/herbing and level a herbing alt(druid recommended) and switch over to tailoring/alchemy on your main once your alt is up and going.  Honestly enchanting is so much damn work for so little reward unless you have the top end enchants.
---
There was a post on r/wow with 5k upvotes detailing it, that's where I saw it 
---
Payo for all rogue content
---
people as in you everyone else got it
---
yes there is on kronos smart guy
---
yep, if u get 1 shot then ur just afk
---
No hardcore competitive guild runs dkp or anything similar
---
Honestly rereading what I wrote. I'll back off the streamer one. In my head I have them so linked with esports they get hate they don't deserve from me.
---
That being said. Classic wow is an RPG not a sport. Trying to make wow into a balanced sport is why their subs have tanked. They need to focus on immersion and a sense of adventure. Those ideas are antithetical to an esports mentality. 
---
Thank you, I thought something seemed off about the video and I couldn't figure out what it was.
---
What about the huge populations, dynamic spawns, pet pathing, 24/7 busy servers, inflated economy?
---
&gt;But if I'm playing horde as a hunter I will see paladins everywhere with blessing of freedom in my face.
---
Not a big issue.  Scatter Shot them, hit cheeta and kite them like crazy.  Or if beast then pet stun them and get moving.  Goal is to drain their mana then kill them.    Pallys are a long fight for a hunter, but not a hard one if you know what you're doing and you have the room to kite.  The nice thing about fighting pallys is because they don't have a slow, if you screw up the kite it's pretty unlikely they can kill you before you get moving again.
---
Horde only 
---
And it was absolutely bad game play. It effectively fucks the player by wasting his skill and it not being useful
---
It's not better or worse but it is very different. Classic wow is magical in it's own way. All of the classes feel far more varied. It lowers balance sure but the game doesn't feel homogenized. There are not short cuts. Yes the one path forward is easier then Mythics but there is only one path. No short cuts here. This creates a sense of foreboding. No flying mounts mean that the world is large and inconvenient. This also builds on immersion.
---
Retail vs Classic to me is like comparing a game to a world. Thats the only way I can put it. Logging into BFA is like logging into a game. One you may love and enjoy. Logging into classic wow though is more like leaving earth to go somewhere new.
---
But spell batching wasn't about casting at the same time, I could be faster and have my skill wasted because of how it worked, that's shit
---
I don't do guns, but for bows orc male and NE female.  Orc males, in particular, have a really nice crossbow animation, which is good considering most of the good bows in the game are crossbows.
---
They eventually tethered all the world bosses to their zone.  People can still kite lesser elite mobs to major cities though.
---
how many points into suppression do you run early?
---
I get where you're coming from on streamers though - so many are just "youtuber" personalities that have expanded beyond their three-minute-loud-house-music-intros and SMASH LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE AND RINGADING THAT BELL channels into streaming and it's not good for anyone.
---
I mean it was a mind game on both sides, do you blink early and take less damage or do you blink late and try to waste his gouge? It was extremely read and skill dependent and I don't see how thats bad gameplay.
---
these there is on P servers smart guy
---
I feel like amplify curse has to be better value than 2% CoA damage
---
Yep like I said though. I am far more worried about the need for "fairness" the esports people bring. Fairness has no place in a proper MMORPG. Chasing it will do nothing but bleach the personality from the game. I'll cite BFA for that.
---
Its very likely tbh. WoW should be f2p are 5/mo and 40 for expansions instead of 60. Then ill come back but until then its Apex Legends 
---
What's the Khold up
---
If you are a bit into music/music theory, [*Scorecraft* by Chimly is an awesome series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhLNjw9aCPLLjGGnszqYg6WnzZlbtdBI5). Really nice in depth analysis of the classic WoW soundtrack. 
---
There are some guide-oriented channels that others have mentioned that are pretty well made, like Frostadamus. But even among the higher-effort channels most content is very generic and tend to repeat the same things others have already talked about at length. For me personally there probably won't be much interesting content until after Classic releases and people have something interesting to do videos about. 
---
Bobby's IRL brother played a Mage named Chuck, who wasn't in this raid but was in our guild. No joke.
---
Madseasonshow, Esfand and the podcast «Countdown to Classic»! Tier one stuff.😊
---
Yeah but if we are talking dungeon DPS, it's about 70% spite. Stop taking DMG you could avoid and u won't die :P
---
It was extremely luck dependent too. No one can accurately predict the ticks all the time, it involved real knowledge and luck.
---
If I hit blink 300 ms before you I can still be gouged even though I was faster
---
Simple names are always so dope
---
Paladin loot did use to drop for Horde raids but I believe they patched it out later In vanillas lifetime.
---
Dam why do people hate my memes?
---
Well, if you count gear as "set up", okay.  
---
  
---
Mages can 1 shot np  
---
"BUT WHAT IF THE ENEMY HAS CDS!"  
---
We talking about 1 shots: 
---
Warlock can 1 shot ez with succ  
---
Warrior with a sexy weapon 1 shots  
---
Rogue stunlock can be counted as 1shot kek  
---
Ele shamans geared 1shot np, tho those are rare  
---
and probably others.  
---
Vanilla is not the peak of counterplay, a lot of times you're just fucked because of how the situation is and you werent ready for it
---
Deviate fish 
---
I don’t get the joke. Why would one feel as if they can’t log out due to getting a BoE epic?
---
I used to raid with the official Button Bashers guild in wotlk, the guild and organization leader had named his character "Piidalicious" but was forced to change it, so he renamed it "Pii", which for some reason stuck. You can google his name and although BB hasnt existed for a long time, you stil l get a bunch of hits with 'Michael "Pii" Groen' lol.  
---
    
---
I think I heard his name being said like 100 times per raid night on teamspeak lol.
---
That fool is just so gosh darn negative. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him legitimately smile.
---
I think my stuff is pretty good. Bit biased though :P
---
Which vid is that? While I don't like how he acts he's usually very clued up about certain things, his old leveling guide videos I thought were solid and he made some very accurate assessments/digging in regards to corrupt servers.
---
Marie Kodo asks, *does this +4agi polearm spark joy?*
---
Not even remotely but ok. 
---
Huh, I musta missed that somehow, but I still know he is exaggerating. They don't automatically ban you from reports. You can be banned from reports if you're a multiple time offender but the ban itself is manually carried out.
---
If memory serves 1.12 has full diminishing returns. Think the 1.4 patch introduced it.
---
&gt; I'd say it's superior in a structured guild with good leadership and a mature team.
---
This became my opinion ever since my first time being in a guild seriously focused on progression.  Before then I thought loot council was obviously just going to be abused and littered with favoritism.
---
If you're in a guild that you can't trust with loot council, you're in a shit guild with shit people.
---
I think it will be a great experience so long as Blizzard does not introduce new systems that decrease the community's ability to police itself. 
---
That's because he's lying to you: https://imgur.com/a/sR1OMaO
---
Nice slander. https://imgur.com/a/sR1OMaO
---
If you are a total clicker you shouldn't worry about it too much. Just start with the spells that you press most often and and bind them to buttons that you find easy to press. Keep adding binds as you get more comfortable. You can worry about optimizing your binds when you have everything bound. If you find yourself going back to clicking under pressure situations you can get a bar addon and hide the bars with your keybinds so that you literally can't click them.
---
Because we’re tired of beating a dead horse that doesn’t even reflect reality. 
---
We care about the long term health of the game—not to mention a successful launch—and we understand that sharding the early zones is pretty much the only reasonable way to ensure that players of all corners of the gaming world will be able to enjoy their experience in Classic in 2019. 
---
Starting zones literally take an hour, maybe an hour and a half to leave—not to mention that the actual launch of Vanilla will never be replicated because for most people *there wasn’t even a proper launch*, due to realms crashing and log-in queues, etc. 
---
Sharding is the solution for grown ups who understand the compromises that need to be made in order to ensure the health of the game’s *bigger picture.*
---
Finally, this “fear” that sharding the early zones will lead to being able to “shard-hop” to multiple Kazzak’s, for example, is almost willfull ignorance and disinformation at this point. 
---
Who cares what sex someone wants to play as?
---
I'm a guy, I'll make a guy character because I prefer it - nothing deeper than that. Get lost.
---
Haha I'm 26 years old but I guess I will always be the younger brother... To be fair he is reasonable so won't force me to do something I don't want to do, I do just want to find a cool class combo
---
Frost is the man and my favorite as well. 
---
Less gear dependent? SL Lock by faaaaaaar. Easily the best class without gear for random BGs, IMO.

Most of the Classic YouTubers did not play real Vanilla and only have info based on stories and undocumented servers.  Look at their ages, people.

What's going on in the pic please?

Sadly I cannot stand his accent =(
---
I kited a dragon from Ashenvale to  Org. It had an aoe sleep ability with a long range. 
---
Why do you regret the decision? I only ask because I was thinking about making my warrior a human female since I think the armors look better on them. 
---
Most recently 1, because I was concentrating on green quests. I get 3 by level 19 for sure, and 5 by level 24. 
---
Illidan
---
I second that, they are really enjoyable, awesomly edited and he seems like to know his shit. 
---
Why do people pretend totem twisting and powershifting were commonplace in vanilla? Druids were like the least played class so we all knew each other on the server, and I can't name a single one who played feral outside of PVP. 
---
do you find yourself fighting mobs higher level than you often? I'm trying to plan for classic but have minimal pserver experience
---
Too hd for what?
---
What?
---
1. SL Locks are terrible in BGs.
---
2. Warlocks are far more gear dependent than mages.
---
OP,
---
Frost Mage is what you are looking for. Insane utility and burst, one of the best PvP classes in Vanilla for wPvP and BGs.
---
all his videos are informations googled in 25 sec. 
---
Lorewise, yes, I absolutely love Tirisfal. Definitely a great starting zone.
---
But to play, my favourites will always be Teldrassil and Mulgore.
---
Honestly - watch this dudes videos. It's less information overload and more an adventure. Good stuff.
---
One thing I hope doesn't change since they're rebuilding classic from retail, and zones are broken up now. I use to take tick from tanaris to crossroads back in the TBC.
---
That other druid is a fucking champ for going along
---
LOL only noobs arent ready. mage 1 shot? only if he puts u in poly. he has no iceblock with 1 shot spec so if u cant kill him then ur noob. Warrior 1 shot? LOL if any class loses to a warrior then u just misplayed or got outplayed. rogue stunlock lmfao, no rogue can stunlock u to death unless ur also a rogue urself. or noob. 
---
ele shamans cant 1 shot lmfao and if u let him get a cast on u then ur noob.
---
learn to play. git gud. 
---
With how out of touch and retarded blizzard has become they'd probably get someone like Jake Paul to do a WoW commercial. 
---
Yes? Your reading comprehension game is lacking
---
It happens. If you’re no bothered by resist messages, then you can do without. If it’s annoying, then invest more. You need 16 hit for bosses, so plan accordingly. 
---
The game has enough normalfags screeching for changes as it is, we don't need to lower the bar anymore.

A good paladin will put blessing of sacrifice on someone to break sheeps on himself without needing to bubble.

Looks great. Good job.
---
Damn. How can someone get so blown the fuck out in one thread. Just stop digging yourself deeper, mate. 
---
I was mistaken, at least for the time being. 
---
I can't comment on the AQ war effort but they experienced no sharding and good stability so it was better than retail launches by that bar alone. As for what you've said I think it's all very reasonable. I think though it might be more dependant on the server, it's my impression that generally speaking the wider audience are going to be better players but not necessarily as dedicated as the top players. Private servers like ***blank*** tend to have all the most hardcore players centered in one place, I don't think their behaviour is a good example of the average player and still too many players there sucked. 
---
I'm not talking about not just using consumables but everything from an understanding of rotations to spells, I even met a paladin that had never played before from across the pond that wanted me to explain how seals worked and so on. It was like bumping in to kid me when I first played back in the day. I imagine we'll see a very popular server for both each region with it's own weird kind of economy, whether that's because people are drawn there for streamers, player count, so on and the other servers will be far less professional? That's the impression I get at least.
---
Don't get me wrong I definitely think we'll have smarter, well informed players, but I don't think every guild will demand every consumable and so on for every raid. I'm quite worried that people will abuse dire maul and other such things, while I don't want changes and know I can't ask for them I wish they would 'fix' things like that.
---
I don't really think this would make any sense. Why bann some 1.12 items because they are new and keep the old updated onse because they are old?
---
This just sounds good on paper. For example should one class be able to play in 1.12 gear and another class play in pre 1.10 because their gear was added in as new and not updated?
---
could you elaborate?
---
This guy is best left alone while he calms down.
---
Hell yeah it is.
---
Hi reminds me of xpearl. But cleaner 
---
Would love more! Seriously cool. Something darkshire related would hit me right in the nostalgia XD
---
&gt;they have to guess at some values
---
No, they literally don't. If anything it's going to be a very unique feel from private servers because they *don't* have to guess values. I'm sure there will be plenty of Classic-unique bugs and interactions though. Hence why there needs to be a beta to iron that stuff out.
---
Poor guy. I'm a mage!
---
You only really compete with your own faction.
---
Horde has the explosive damage. Alliance has stronger defense. Horde starts as the stronger faction, but alliance scales better with gear.
---
Feel like I hit the jackpot with this. I've kept in touch with my guildies from back in vanilla. We play random steam games from time to time. I've been foaming at the mouth for Classic, and recently found out that 4 of them are equally excited and a couple other are joining as well. Another cool thing is, we played through Wrath. One guy joined up in Wrath and clicked with our group, so he'll be able to experience classic with us. 
---
We've been talking about class selection, and getting ready. We're switching to PvE this go around (PvP in vanilla), since we have more limited time with jobs. Oddly enough, our group needs more DPS. Everyone wants to be shamans and priests, which is fine. I'm going warlock in classic. Was a hunter in vanilla.
---
I was under the impression they just had MOST of the original data, not all of it. Not sure where I read that so probably just a misconception on my end. A beta would be very nice regardless.
---
10/10 troll
---
Moonkins = Owl City
---
They have all the data from 1.12 and onwards they are just missing some of the pre 1.12 data and they stated they have a 1.12 original server running internally aswell for the reason to cross check. 
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
Another classic woah video.

i tried this on my alt hunter, got as far as the gates of org but never inside :&lt;

This is False. Notice the comment is from patch 2.0.1

You can do this quest in vanilla.

Shandris Feathermoon i think is one of the more hilarious npc's to kite to Org. But i cant remember if she had her AOE Moonfire in classic or not. I think it was TBC that we kited her to Org
---
https://classicdb.ch/?npc=3936
---
Great response. Glad to see this thanks for taking the time. I think you've described the situation well. It seems like the issue is going to be gold farming "outside" the world, where the runs can be done solo and instances reset @ 5 per hour or something. 
---
He literally doesn't know jack shit about the game, and is only able to read a script using someone else's content.
---
You should watch his interviews when he is not reading off a script, he is completely ignorant of even the most fundamental abilities of Warrior (a class that he says has been his main for almost 15 years).
---
Stop posting Netherwing (private server, not even a Vanilla one) content.
---
Only play Orc if you're going to PvE. Nobody likes a lootbox gamer (relies on stun resistance to win)
---
Can we get another Ozzy commercial too then?
---
This was posted a while ago no?
---
Doesn’t work like that ;)
---
this is the most retarded comment i've seen on this subreddit yet 
---
I heard there was a rather infamous group that would meet up in Los Angeles back in the day. Thought it was the coolest thing ever, and would love to be in a guild that did this come WoW Classic!
---
I've made a few things from it and enjoyed them. The salmon dish was really good.
---
In the video I have 3 by 19, and 5 by level 24 lol... 
---
One example would be rep. Rep gains are wrong on private servers. So people are thinking they're going to get exalted with another race on their faction by 40 to get their mount instead, which won't happen.
---
But just in general numbers are off. So things are going to be different.
---
when I moved to a new highschool the first friendly person I met told me the server everyone was playing on so i met a lot of people in game before I did irl lol
---
I xfered an alt to illidan during tbc cos one of my friends was on that realm. That was one of the craziest experiences I ever had.
---
I started playing in early BC, I’ll never forget levelling in redridge mountains and coming across a max level hunter walking backwards with a massive ?? Dragon walking after him slowly. Silly me I jumped to his aide and valiantly tried to slay the beast only to be killed soon after. The hunter whispered me all kinds of expletives telling me how he was intentionally kiting the beast to storm wind. 
---
So what do you mean you couldn’t do this past a vanilla patch?
---
For PvE dps, would improved imp firebolt help? I know most the time in dungeons I used to run an imp for the stam buff, so might help overall DPS more than the other choices. Then again, imp ran out of mana quicker, so maybe it wont help overall?
---
I think these daily posts are getting really old.
---
Salty stun resistance gamer spotted
---
IIRC from vanilla it was only sales that took one hour to go through to get your money. Buying an item would land it in your mailbox instantly
---
I'd rather have WoW 2 than Classic BC as BC is when the game started getting bad imo (flying, dailies, insane welfare systems, streamlined questing)
---
My old guild. Good times.
---
I played Undead in Vanilla, but I just like the look of Orcs so much more now for some reason. The extra pet damage is a bonus. And the stun resist is just a bonus bonus.
---
What makes mages less gear dependent? Are their nukes just solid already without a shitload of +damage or crit? I had assumed the warlock would have an edge thanks to their ability to pretty much ignore spirit, but I haven't played Vanilla since, y'know, it was actually Vanilla.
---
Think he mean's for this to be an authentic Vanilla photo, and not a Private server photo.
---
Tips out makes great stuff for the vanilla noob. Best for that audience.
---
special retail snowflakes triggered hard mission complete
---
Pretty sure I rolled a toon on that server to be in one of those guilds...
---
so? if u get 1 shot big deal. 1 shotting is fun, yet its not viable in competitive pvp. That's perfectly fine with me. 
---
Agreed. 
---
I love tbe theofycrafting posts and shit that is actually usefull to the future players.
---
But these one sided “plans for classic” posts are just dreadful
---
It was fixed in wrath I believe.
---
A lot
---
Summer 2019 is soon :(
---
This takes the cake for me too lol
---
Bring Kazzak to Org fun times.
---
Late 2005 Illidan. Official.
---
Pretty much. SL locks arent bursty and rely on tanking hits. Mages are all about not getting hit as much as possible and blowing shit up. This is what makes warlocks more gear dependent
---
None of them. Don't promote that garbage.
---
If the point you are making is that paladins are the most op support class in classic. You will get no argument from me. As I said pally&gt;priest&gt;shaman&gt;druid. I'll even expand on this to say Paladin and Priest are miles ahead of the other two. Access to defensive dispel magic is not to be under estimated. CC spells in classic wow are devastating. 
---
It's a crutch for bad players not a bonus
---
Oof. Saw the thumbnails, immediately noped out of there.
---
Dude actually got the name Gruul pre-BC
---
[Looks like he created that character near release.](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/814426)
---
Because the items they added in were supposed to act as catch-up gear so that people could skip a few tiers of raiding. It doesn't make sense having them there from the beginning. It would be like launching TBC with sunwell badge gear available from the start.
---
You could easily say WotF is a crutch for bad players by this flawed logic. 25% chance to resist stun is insanely good..
---
At this point I'm just glad they are committed to releasing an official classic server. I think the expression goes something like "beggars can't be choosers".as long as they provide an authentic classic experience even if it is just a static 1.12.1 patch with everything out from the start would be miles better than the private server world and instability/bugs. No offense to anyone who spent their free time developing the emulator cores that allowed so many people to continue to experience vanilla wow in all it's glory. They are what made blizzard finally take serious that people actually wanted vanilla.
---
That was great, thanks for sharing.
---
My pleasure! Cheerios!
---
This post was removed due to Rule #1 (posts must be about Classic, not private servers). Please try r/wowservers.
---
Ohh yeah that wasn't possible on my server. The TB rep itself was crazy. I won't say my pserver was spot on but it had to be close at least. People sit here and talk about outlandish things and im like... my pserver did exactly what you said it should... maybe they weren't close. It sounds like they were the closest so far. I remember looking up TB rep and going oh yeah ok I can do this in so many hand ins... It was so far off. On my pserver TB rep hand ins took forever because you didn't get near as much rep as what was listed in guides.
---
Agreed. Not all Pservers are bad. People act like they aren't even close to the real thing and then talk about how each time they figured out they were wrong and corrected it... so then by their own admission they were getting closer and closer. 
---
Surprised? I know exactly how many quest hubs and FPs were in vanilla. I actually played vanilla. I can prove it with my tabard of the protector achievement. Even then... I don't think we are going to start at the point where there weren't enough quests to hit max.
---
My guild in Retail has a "festival" every year where people who want to meet up at someone's house. They change the location every year. They always do it during blizzcon so they can watch the virtual ticket.
---
Nah you just hit prep and vanish again
---
make more videos like this please
---
I'd shoot myself.
---
Sure thing, new to making videos but I love Vanilla Wow so going to making more videos on that for sure.
---
That's a pretty cool idea. Pretty good turn out? Did you personally ever go to one?
---
One nagga two nagga three nagga wat
---
Thanks a lot, this answers my question perfectly.
---
No i never have gone to one. I joined the guild because my oldest WoW friend is an officer an the GMs sister. I used to be on the server but had server hopped through different expansions. Finally the last of my wow friends had quit playing except for her. I went back to my old server and joined her guild. Only a few people really ever talked to me and since I am a social player I slowly quit playing. I love contributing to a guild and getting to raid but they had their clique already. The GM wouldn't talk to me directly about what I needed to do to raid with them... he would ask my friend with me right there in discord... Is he ready yet? like dude... im right here... just tell me what you want me to do. No joke I was the druid class lead when my friend came to me telling me the officers told her to talk to me on how to be a resto druid in BC. I know how to play the game but the GM/Brother wouldn't really give me the time of day. So I quit retail. Pservers for me until Classic. Sorry for the life story but it kinda outlines why I never went to one of the meetings.
---
I would frequently 2 and 3v1 back in the day with blues. It wasn't difficult on a Lock.
---
They can outlive, no burst, though. But you don't see folks removing a whole lot of debuffs.
---
If he wants something that can survive and kill without nukes in randoms without gear, SL locks are pretty much invincible if played correctly.
---
WotF isn't a % chance it's guaranteed so there's no luck involved
---
I love it! 
---
In reality, DPS 2 should wait until after the next pull to respond.
---
And the stun resist doesn’t have a CD so it’s 25% on every stun. While WotF is on CD it does nothing. You’re completely missing my point— they’re both racials that have uses. I’d just personally rather be able to deny a Rogue his opener or a full Kidney/HoJ etc, especially considering Warlock’s trinket breaks Fear/Charm and doesn’t break Stun. They’re both crutches either way you look at it..
---
People aren't arguing that it'll lead to less ninja looting. People are arguing that it will lead to more of it.
---
Aren't all businesses "money making schemes"?
---
Hooooly crap dude that site just brought back so many memories. I started on Illidan horde too, just looked up my old guild and some names I couldn't remember for the life of me just came back like it was so recent.
---
Sooo... how does loot trading stop that again?
---
Some of the most fun I've ever had on twitch was watching Payo and his world PvP Nostalrius streams
---
Lol deleted the previous one then? Notice I state a before and after. I stopped giving dat joke of a human views long ago so not gonna hunt it down.
---
Then keep a personal blacklist.
---
Why would you want to be in a guild that forces you to give up the loot that you rolled on? Why wouldn't they just make it master loot at that point?
---
The problem with retail is that it's cross-realm so you rarely see the same person twice. In classic, you see the same people all the time and if you group with that person that loot funneled or tried to coerce you into giving them your loot after being told no.
---
That is literally the first video I've ever done on professions. I've literally never said engineering is useless. I even had a 60 warlock in vanilla wow with engineering. Sorry, I didn't know stevie wonder used reddit.
---
Yeah that's balls. Always sucks being excluded in a cliquey guild. Hopefully you can find some good people once classic releases. 
---
Not to mention there is just too many unknowns when it comes to this topic, its being beaten like a dead horse. If it does well then there is lots of possibilities for that, if it doesn't, well then there is a whole other set of possibilities. We just have to wait and see. 
---
Stop arguing with someone whose sole argument is his hurt feelings after getting killed by an orc.
---

---
He was talking a out Bgs so thats what I based my insight on.
---
Burst &gt; outliving in bgs
---
Lol. I watched and enjoyed them both when I was getting back into vanilla for the pserver scene. Then i realized it was trash. Denying a former vids existence doesn't mean it didn't happen. Either way, toxic man can argue with himself. Bye.
---
Can you provide evidence or ANY details on the make-believe video you're saying I produced? I'm toxic but you're literally making up lies saying I made a video that I did not make. I literally just linked you a video of a guide I made on professions a month after I made my channel.
---
Might be a little rough for the first 10 levels since there wouldn't be a class trainer for you in mulgore/TB as a lock. However, if you're questing together you gimpiness in that level range wouldn't really matter. Plus first 10 levels are the fastest in the game (obvious statement). I'd say just meet at the 2nd town in mulgore at level 6. Probably an hour of gameplay maybe to get to 6 and then you'd only have to really miss out on level 8 spells (until level 10). Although I could see how not missing any levels could matter. 
---
Isn’t it on mobile now?
---
I was thinking the same thing but then I wasn't sure if the mobile game was RS3 or OSRS  
---
I am fairly certain I spent all my silver on engineering goggles in 2007, waited an hour to get them, then realised I could not equip them. 12 years may have made me into a liar.. I hope the mail is instant.
---
Unfortunately, blacklisting on servers wasn't as surefire as people make it out to be. If they put in loot trading, abuses like the one you describe will go almost entirely unpunished.
---
I just finally unsubbed from tips a few days ago, after seeing the title of his new video "The feature that will DESTROY Classic WoW - Automated Right Click Reporting".
---
I liked his educational vanilla stuff but can't stand the opinion stuff. Even though I mostly agree with what he's saying it just comes of as being a click-bait drama queen.
---
I'd resub if he stuck to guides etc.
---
warlocks still have drain life. 
---
I saw Alex as having the potential for being one of the best Classic WoW content creators in the business, if it wasn't for the overwhelming schizophrenic and narcissistic tendencies he has to constantly battle with.  
---
It's not just healing abilities. Azerite armor frequently has shields and auto-heals. Which is nice, because the maps are so small and condensed, whenever you run someplace, the path will be filled with mobs whacking at you. 
---
"I pity the fool who ain't gonna go classic! Login to a classic server today to recieve your Mohawk grenade. Offer available for limited time only."
---
I talk to 2 coworkers and 1 friend who all played during vanilla. All 3 of them said they wouldn't. I know at least 1 of them will give in.. 
---
We don't want classic TBC and wotlk, we want classic+ with more level 60 content. 
---
Your memes are bad and you should feel bad. 
---
I've either lost contact or grown apart from a lot of my old WoW friends. The ones I've grown apart from I wouldn't want to play with.  
---
I'll be doing the Classic thing alone.  
---
im imagining him as a 13 year old playing a rogue ofcourse, who got triggered after failing a gank on a low life orc warlock 
---
did you bring kazzak on the boat with you?
---
&gt; I’d just personally rather be able to deny a Rogue his opener or a full Kidney/HoJ etc
---
Yeah well played, perfectly executed lootbox strategy 
---
Except that ever happened to me ever in my entire vanilla PvP experience.
---
My mage was a Knight-Captain who casually PvPed in BGs pretty much whenever I didn't have other stuff to do for raiding.
---
I'm not saying spell-batching didn't exist. I'm saying it was so rare as to be irrelevant to gameplay. Even if it wasn't, the idea that it's a good thing to allow rogues to abuse lag to gouge blinking mages is ridiculous.
---
Well, the only rogues you fight against in wpvp are the one who outlevel you, so that's an easy answer. From what I can see though your experience is from actual vanilla, when people were clicking abilities and keyboard turning during leveling. I'm quite sure it's gonna be different this time around. 
---
You also have to accommodate 40 man raids too though, which will be much heavier on the system.
---
More apparent with every post lmao.
---
I hope so. I was "raised" in WoW by good players and good people. I can't wait to help teach the next generation of Vanilla players. 
---
I wonder if this is bannable in 2019
---
Shadow Priests are pretty cancerous in PvP as a caster.
---
you're right
---
Yeah, but not the addons everyone is using today.
---
Healing was far more difficult to coordinate in vanilla, because heal prediction didn't exist for most of it. If you're actually in favour of no changes, then any addons that didn't exist before TBC shouldn't be allowed.
---
Most unexpected
---
Are you the guy who recovered his lost account and put it up on youtube?? If so, I just saw that video today lol
---
Ohh I won't argue against that. I don't want modern addons... I never really used many to begin with... just Titan panel and the standard raid ones that were required by every raiding guild. ohh and I discovered xperl at one point... that may have been after vanilla though. I don't want all the QoL addons that exist today... though I don't know why people need them since the game pretty much hands you everything on a platter. 
---
I know what you mean about healing. I was a healer too. I remember having all the raid frames dragged out from the raid interface and running around MC with all those names on my screen. I fell in the lava once because I was running and healing. 
---
Graysfordays
---
soon™
---
I dont know about bad person. 
---
Id say passionate person. 
---
Good videos though would recommend to anyone. 
---
One shots means no counter play, which is bad game design. Removing one player's ability to react turns him into a NPC, basically. Terrible, terrible game design. You need to give your players the feeling that if they did better, they could have won. 
---
Hard counters I can somewhat concede, the game is supposed to be played with other people who make up for your shortcomings as your make up for theirs. 
---
Engi dependence is the worst offender of all, though. Being required to choose a specific prof to be able to compete is the shittiest game design I can think of. You remove player choice. How can that ever be a good thing. 
---
Fair enough.
---
had something of superstitum lol :D
---
spite should be much bigger :D
---
Alts. You already have a full BiS 60 and you could spend your time farming up tons of gold in the meanwhile and avoiding the launch mess and then your alt will have tons of gold in a few weeks and wont have to worry about your skills or a mount.
---
This is my biggest concern with vanilla. People who are used to chain lolpulling low level dungs in retail are going to charge in with same mentality, 90% of them dont even know what "wait for 3 sunders" even means, and will RQ at the first wipe.
---
As long as Activision Blizzard stays loyal to what Classic was the game will be more then fine and easily bring in new subs for them.
---
Would farming it against fresh 60s really be contested even? If someone from the other faction decides to step in you can just kill them easily lol
---
YOU GONNA DIE
---
You've got to be kidding. PvE balance has only improved since vanilla. How can you post this with a straight face. You can complain and shit on retail as much as you want, it doesn't change the numbers. Having 4-5 classes out of 10 being able to do viable dps when every single class has at least one spec designed to do dps is absolute trash balance. The balance isn't perfect on retail, but it's a hell of a lot better than it was in vanilla. 
---
You're spot on. I don't care how much people shit on Vanilla raiders, when we my guild went into Naxx, we were all wearing full tier 2 with a few smattered pieces of AQ gear. In some cases, Tier 2 gear is actually as good or better than AQ40 (equipment wise, not so much weapons, trinkets etc), so it wasn't like we were undergeared.
---
We got fucking smashed on multiple boss attempts and it wasnt even close. Flasks, potions the whole shebang, still got roasted. Could we have played better and won? Yes obviously. But at the same time, as i've said before, what was the incentive? No one thought Naxx gear was going to last to level 70 and we had to spend crazy amounts of time to farm mats and get ready to go to naxx, especially in light of people then starting to drop from the guild because, you guessed it, Naxx was fucking hard and a big time commitment.
---
People are in for a big shock come classic, of that I am certain.
---
I care
---
&gt; In PvE, it's important for raids to be designed around everyone competing on some sort of meter, whether it's damage or healing. Your effectiveness is not in how well you support the group, but in how much damage or healing you do (while also not screwing up). The big push for enrage timers to matter, as well as for there to be a more-and-more comprehensive checklist for what each role needs has pushed this homogenization.
---
This has to be the dumbest shit I've seen posted on this sub yet. Vanilla was a LOT more about numbers than retail is. There was barely any boss mechanics. Either you had enough hps/dps or you didn't. There was so few ways to fail a boss mechanic and causing a wipe because of it. 
---
Even comparing boss mechanics in vanilla vs tbc, it's like night and day. 
---
P.S.: everyone who complains about damage meters is a baddie in denial, change my mind. 
---
Ok, then quote me on that.
---
If you're leveling together I reccomend you do two classes that wont have competition for gear. E.g. Warrior and Warlock.
---
Good luck on your journey!
---
No, it’s actually coming. 
---
That's what the wow token will be for.
---
It certainly does for certain classes. PvP trinkets were class specific back then. 
---
Yes! The New Ironman series is really enjoyable.
---
Isn't OSRS full of #changes, though? I'm really hoping Blizzard follows the same path and starts adding new content once the progression to Naxx is over. Playing a balanced, post naxx vanilla would be the dream. 
---
Yes, that's correct!
---
If your looking for 1 spot that has a collection of videos from all over the place watch asmongold, all he does it watch other peoples videos.

A lot of angry neanderthals mass downvoting cuz the truth hurts.. Aww. Danish kiss.
---
Kazzak to SW has been done a few times, was fun
---
Dope
---
Do you hav a source? Genuinely curious
---
Osrs started off with #nochanges until people maxed. It is still the same osrs experience, they learned from their mistakes. Changes are not a bad thing. Bad changes are.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;Changes are not a bad thing.
---
*faint autistic screeching in the background*
---
There'll be a few interesting bugs for sure, mainly to do with pathfinding/LoS/batching/aggro/mob behaviour/boss scripting that won't implement exactly the same in the new engine, even with the exact same db values.
---
They said it won't be based on 1.12. Not all raids would be available from the start for example.
---
And gwen howerton as the elf
---
Yeah, pretty much the only person who is big in classic content who was actually there was madseason, and he's got the shit in his bank to back it up. But he was also real young and admits he was bad, I think his guild made some AQ progression.
---
At least 2 (of 4 people I'm still in touch from my BC and WotLK days).
---
Well then, the only simple solution is to not play a race because each of them gives you something that can be relied on to win!
---
Amazing advice 10/10 would worship again.
---
I see post titles that I don't think I'll like sometimes. My solution is not reading them.
---
Fuck him after that sob story he posted on here.
---
I still call my friend caity (who is a female bodybuilder) caitmonster to this day! Love it. 
---
Well he is completly right,though. Just as crit or hit CHANCES are super bad, because they are no guaranteed damage increase, stun resistance is really bad.
---
If you have any further doubts here is our math teacher that will clarify any confusion about the percentages at play, you might still have: [the numbers dont lie](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WFoC3TR5rzI)    /s
---
RS is free to play though, which is a huge factor
---
Sounds like a raid boss in Naxx or ICC
---
Losing the cools down is a lot bigger than you are considering.
---
Wat
---
What? Huge difference between something that works when you say so and something that sometimes works and when it does often outright wins you a fight without any effort on your part. You're beyond moronic
---
Eauauauauauuwarghauahah
---
Wrong game for you.
---
I don't feel like it removes choice, it forces you to make hard choices. You can PvP as any profession but you may be at a slight disadvantage. Just like in life, there's hard choices, there's compromise and you can't be good at everything.
---
If you want to enjoy PvP without min-maxing you can, if you want to min-max then you can do that too but all choices have consequences.
---
Frost mage doesn't give a two shits about gear. Just get "of the eagle" greens from the AH and you're good to go.
---
You get around 1.7k HP for *free* with ice barrier (it has 1min uptime with 30sec cd, so you can use it twice, or even thrice with cold snap).
---
If you froze someone you get +50% CRIT without any +crit gear on that person for free, thanks to Shatter. You've also got +100% dmg on that crit with Ice Shards, making so-called "Shatter combo's".
---
You're hit-capped with in PvP without any +hit gear needed once again, with elemental precision talent. Even overcapped IIRC, as you only need 2/3 on that. 
---
Your poly/cs+silence/snares also will always work for their full duration and won't miss no matter what your items looks like, considering the aforesaid.
---
Fire IS the spec that needs and scales well with gear, as it's pretty mana dependent, can be rather squishy and also gains alot from the upgrades you get (see Ignite/all the crit-based perks). 
---
Frost, however, is about utility and survivability more than about dmg. It's good on it's own.
---
priest mage rogue - undead
---
It's not really a hard choice. Either you want to be competitive in pvp and you pick the good profession, or you don't care about it and you pick whatever you like. It forces your hand. The same way raiding forces you into one role (unless you're a warrior). 
---
This is bad game design imo. Choices only really matter when all options can be picked. If you don't pick engi, you're wrong. If you don't pick innervate, you're wrong. 
---
Cant tell if sarcasm or utterly crazy.
---
Definitely try out ImAliveTv, it's a hardcore player with focus on casters. He has played through pretty much every good private server there was, and knows a lot. You can be sure he's not guessing when he gives advice. Also has his own discord where you can talk to him about anything, he usually responds super quick and doesnt mind going deep into your issue/question :)
---
It is also available on mobile and includes changes voted by the userbase.

You're such a clown. Your last 2 posts you deleted because they did not accumulate expected amount of upvotes. Your other post was deleted because mods finally deemed them 'low-effort'.

Just stop with your karma-whoring low-effort 'memes'.

'current WoW bad, Vanilla good'
---
meaningless ravings like this https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak5wxc/key_ring_how_important_it_was_for_immersion_and/
---
And you pump them out like it's your job. You'd think quality should be better.
---
It's infuriating seeing this type of garbage here. PLEASE, stop making these.
---
they released a mobile portal to the game for osrs, allowing people to play the same servers/worlds as pc users would, but also from their phone.
---
Blizzard should take a note out of Jagex's book and implement a dedicated design team (done), community involvement, and esports/events. 
---
I really impressed a girl by once by knowing this song. She was later very disappointed when I wasn't a musical fan, just a wow nerd.

Funny and very creative !

I think it's illegal to show up at funerals and kill people
---
Personally I don't like that kind of brokenness, but I certainly sympathize with the fun of making such a thing work.  I like it once in a while.  Given how broken real life is in parts of society, it certainly makes it more realistic. :P
---
So yeah, it seems you totally got what what I meant about agreeing with you.  I see now how TBC really just finished a lot of things instead of just being a huge overhaul of an update like every subsequent expansion even though it felt like one at the time.
---
People in this sub have a hard on for blacklisting others thinking it somehow gives them power and is a credible threat. It doesnt and it isnt. The vast majority of people wont give a single fuck when you start crying in Trade chat that one of DPS left your Wailing Caverns group after wiping 5 times and demand that everybody shut him out for eternity.
---
Reasonably, the only thing that gets people blacklisted to an extent that might matter is ninja looting in raids.
---
You’re dillusional if you think wow is worth 240 dollars a year 
---
Indeed it was 
---
Vanilla WoW is incompatible with eSports, isn't designed to be one.
---
How 1.10-1.12 items are added will alter things dramatically compared to private servers. I expect that arcanite will sell for a lot if Titanic Leggings can be made early on, for example.
---
And instead tickets are created against ninja looters. :/
---
And? This is wow subreddit, so I ask you politely to get the fuck out of here with this garbage game
---
Funerals aren't really meant to be remembered...
---
During BC I raided with 9 real life friends and we would get dennys after raid ended at like 1 or 2 am every week. 
---
I’m pretty sure they’ll soon realize they need the big crew for classic and the small one for retail because nobody will ever play this crap again 
---
Classic needs to just release 
---
The BiS thing may not be too much of an issue at first, the development schedule blizzard have planned (in theory) shouldn't release a load of the BiS you can gain from dungeon until later on.
---
Originally they were brought in to help players catch up around AQ/Naxxish, not sure which patch that was!
---
That does depend on blizzard purposely not including them though which they haven't said anything about yet, just the planned release schedule. 
---
That's l33t
---
Hahaha, this is epic.
---
Who's this 'we'?
---
Cause TBC and WotLK had way more players and were better games by far.
---
WoW isn't really the phenomenon it used to be. If anything he should be doing Fortnite commercials since it's about equal culturally to what WoW was back in 2004-2007.
---
Lol. Their subs tanked because the game is old. Nothing to do with quality. Legion was one of the best expansions and far below Cata or WoD sub wise.
---
Wow, that was amazing :)
---
Finally - a video that explains how to pvp as a Druid !

---
Mobile vanilla confirmed 
---

---
This would hands down be the coolest way for wow to explode again. A few years after release,  add in community polling. Additions to vanilla gameplay would completely reinvigorate the game
---
This kind of stuff (like the scourge pre launch event) is amazing, it makes for memorable moments and makes not only the world but the community feel alive.
---
I remember people being so angry about the scourge pre launch, like wtf is wrong with you LOL. Retail mind set of not being in a mmorpg but only getting to the end asap, ruining the game in process :/
---
Hay man, It’s your logic. Call me moronic, but we both know your reflecting what you are onto me ;) I’ll make sure to pick no race next time when I play the game.
---
Yeah. Except I have to log in to experiance it... 
---
You can also boil the bananas to soften them
---
More vanilla screenshots are always better. I can't find mine sadly, the oldest I can find are from Wotlk and it's only because I uploaded them on Facebook back in the day, so I'm always happy when I see more of them on this sub.
---
Well, kinda? But you need to play sub if you want to play it seriously.
---
&gt;  I can look out for visual signs, inspect players, use the forums, write in guild a trade chat and be an all round vigilant player for people being an asshole.
---
And i want a dungeon run to be a fun time not a cold war.
---
Fresh and original.

Ion Hazzicostas explicitly said that mail will NOT be instant. The 1 hr mail cooldown will be applied for EVERYONE, regardless if in same guild, bnet friends or characters of the same account.
---
This is one of the few things that we know with 100% certainty : mail WILL NOT be instant.
---
Holy shit I remember exactly that situation when OSRS came out and RS3 players (guess what group it is in WoW) were saying how it will die. Sure, when OSRS had no changes it was actually dying, but when Jagex started adding things, meanwhile keeping that OSRS spirit, that was the time when OSRS took over RS3. 
---
Even before mobile, OSRS was way more populated. 
---
It was not F2P until 2 years into its life, and it was growing considerably beforehand after going through a massive drop with no new content. F2P was also very restricted back then, still is now but less so, to the point where it wasn't even worth it.
---
OSRS Mobile is the actually huge factor as they give out a free week (month?) of membership and since its release the concurrent user count has gone from 50 - 80 thousand to consistently in the 100s. 
---
It was nice small amount of fun, just enough lenght with the memes
---
Doesn't stop Jagex with OSRS  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Biggest Problem of the Shadow Priest is Mana, which completely gets canceled out by the Druids Innervate.
---
When my friend was oom, we would make sure he triggered Spirit Tap and I would Innervate him and he would Reg. so much Mana in matter for Seconds. 
---
You have basically no downtime while leveling.
---
Shadow Priest and Druid can do any Elite Quest DUO. The Vampiric Embrace heals the Druid enough in Bear Form. So you basically Heal/Damage and Tank/Damage. There is no need to group up ever.
---
When you want to do Dungeons, you basically have the Tank and the Healer, so the only thing you will ever need are DDs.
---
You get two of the best Buffs Buffs in WoW. I love this combo.
---
That’s a great link. Thanks.
---
I found what I think is my toon - started Feb 15th 2005 which sounds about right. Apparently I didn’t join a guild till level 55.
---
What a burden
---
mostly TipsOut, Staysafe and Nixxiom
---
At first I wanted to reply that kids sitting in front of their spinach/etc would like to disagree.
---
Then I thought about the fact that the character cooks and eats spider meat and sand worm flesh, so I was convinced that they dont really care about taste.
---
But then I realized I have no idea how sand worm actually tastes like and now i am just confused...pls send help!

Just use the original one
---
I got caught by my mom listening to this back in the days, she enjoyed it with me.
---
Great quality. My gripe is ge trirs too damn hard to be funny. He beats a joke in his videos to death. 
---
Long time RuneScape player here and now old school RuneScape player. 
---
Due to the games getting progressively easier over the years and the introduction of pay to win features there was, and still is, an decreasing amount of players while old school private server were in high demand. 
---
With each update that came out the game sense of accomplishment diminished. 
---
The game was booted back to its original state in 2007. The game is hard, nostalgic, ugly and slow phase. It was a success.
---
To maintain a healthy game that is both developing as well as gets improvement and developments players can vote for polled update suggestions. 
---
This stimulates user generated content and a healthy relationship with the playerbase. 
---
At this day the old school server have almost double the player base of the original server. While the playerbase in old school increases the playerbase of the original game declines. 
---
I strongly hope that games that allow users to vote on updates will make more appearance in the future as it creates a game that can be enjoyed for a long time. 
---
I get that companies have to make a decision between making good updates and making updates that generate income (pay to win, new content with best in slots items/methods, easier game for beginning players to stimulate growth and such), but I think the future of gaming will have to find that golden middle way. 
---
I for one will be playing WoW classic and am hoping there will be some player voted for #changes in the future. 
---
Why you think the net was bornnnnn?
---
I can vouche for this guy! Definently enjoyable! :D
---
nah, when the imp is using firebolt, he is vulnerable to damage and will probably just die pretty easy
---
Aw.
---
Gotta agree, some people need to chill a bit. 
---
You can't trinket out of the Emerald Nightmare dragon sleep
---
&gt; If a player is making mistakes, teach him.
---
I mean, you also have to consider the fact that the other player actually needs to want to learn. I've been in countless of groups with pissy DPS who just don't give a fuck and are completely selfish.
---
I was playing TBC a week or so ago, and there were these mobs which sometimes spell reflected every spell thrown at them. The warlock kept using Seed of Corruption (a very powerful AoE spell known for doing so much damage that it pulls aggro very easily and usually ends up with the warlock dying) and since these mobs would spell reflect, the AoE explosion would not only damage the warlock but the whole group.
---
Multiple times the warlock almost wiped the whole group because he kept spamming his AoE and it exploded on everyone, and a couple of times he actually killed a group member and gave them a repair bill.
---
At that point the rest of us basically had enough, the druid in our group told the leader just kick the warlock but I (as the healer) told him to stop using the spell on the mobs that spell reflect because it's killing the group.
---
I explained him the situation once and why he needs to stop doing it, and the next mob pack he did it again. So I asked him "Did you read what I told you a minute ago?"
---
And his response was "You're the healer and your job is to heal the group, so do your job."
---
So basically he didn't give a fuck that he was mass AoEing the group and giving people repair bills, he just wanted me to heal the damage when he could just not press the spell if a mob spell reflects. 
---
I mean what is the gain for him to do that? If he spams the AoE he does 0 damage with it because of spell reflect, and if he stands still not casting anything he still does 0 damage but at least he's not killing the group - so which one is the better option? Obviously not killing the group.
---
And that's not the only time, I've seen countless of times where a healer or someone else tells a DPS something one time and isn't even being mean about it and the DPS just has a pissy attitude right from the start and refuses to listen.
---
It's not my job to change peoples attitudes if they're assholes, I can tell them to do something that would help the group or make the run go smoother but if they refuse to listen and intentionally make the run harder I have the full authority to choose to not group with those people and it doesn't make me a shitty person or a healer.
---
Also, it's not only about everything going right:
---
When you're doing a dungeon or any group content, you obviously want to do it as effortlessly and effectively as possible. So if your healer would be able to heal 3 packs without drinking normally, but because others just don't care he has to sit down to drink after every single pull then that does nothing but slow your group down and make the content take longer to do for no reason.
---
So if your healer tells someone how they can make things a bit easier and smoother and they refuse to listen, then they're perfectly fine trying to force the other person to play properly by using any means within their power and that includes not healing them.
---
If a DPS is giving me some pissy "Meh, I don't care" response then I'll see if they start to care a bit more after they get a repair bill. Suddenly the guy might start putting in the minimal effort it takes to play the mob pack properly instead of freeloading and thinking other people will just fix his mistakes so he can just be brain AFK because he doesn't care.
---
osrs has released on mobile and is free to play.
---
highly doubt it would be as successful with wows business model.
---
how is osrs an esport?
---
iron man speed running?
---
Runescape reached all time peak membership subscriptions just recently
---
Until I get a confirmed date. I ain't gonna hold my breath. I don't trust blizzard at all right now.
---
So... you're kind of agreeing with me then? That if people cry to trade chat every time somebody does get caught abusing the system, nobody will care? 
---
It's much easier to blacklist someone when they ninja, as they stand out, there is easy definitive proof of it happening, and it's a smaller total number of occurrences. Which is why Loot trading is a bad idea, to reiterate.
---
My point is, a lot of people probably wouldn't have gotten membership if they didn't play f2p first? I know WoW has a trial too but compared to RS it's very limited and timebound
---
Personally, I hope they have changes in Naxx itemization if they actually plan to add even more content after Naxx. Naxx gear is super OP, so we can't have a situation where after Naxx content is even better than Naxx. Another option would be adding only horizontal progression.
---
Deadman Mode
---
I don't see how being good at PvP has anything to do with his videos being good or not.
---
Getting really tired of the same post day in day out
---
Yep and it’s still as good as when it wasn’t on mobile. The OSRS dev team and their ideals are something you won’t find anywhere else in the industry. It’s very rare and the whole OSRS community are aware of this fact. 
---
How viable are specs without max consumes? Thinking of going mage or fury warrior, but I'm slightly worried about mage consumes and raid respecs, and really worried about all the gromsblood for fury consumes (maybe it's not that bad, but I remember all the consumes needed for shadowpriest and I can never farm that much dreamfoil again).
---
WoW on mobile? Fuck yeah im raiding on the toilet now!
---
&gt; Players who believe kicking people for making mistakes are... well, impatient and immature. There's no other way to put it. If a player is making mistakes, teach him. Lift him up. Don't beat him down, kick him out, and exclude him.
---
I'm pretty sure the people in this thread who are talking about this topic don't actually have a problem with new players not knowing what to do.
---
Generally speaking it's very obvious when someone is a new player, and usually they take every tip they can get and try to be as helpful to the group as they can - in other words they usually play with good intent.
---
In most cases when a DPS is doing something shitty, it's not a case of the player being new and not knowing what to do but most of the time they just don't care.
---
I've been in multiple groups where someone asks a person to do something helpful or stop doing something harmful nicely and the guy responds with "Stfu" or something similar and keeps doing it.
---
Usually when people make the mob packs harder than they need to be it's also a case of the person just feeling lazy or DPS whoring or just generally speaking not caring.
---
In those cases (which is the majority of them) it's not a matter of "Just teach them 4Head".
---
Tips was around level 50 in Vanilla before TBC hit.
---
Fingers crossed you can actually kite world bosses to major cities. Something tells me modern blizzard won't want that. Their most current philosophy seems to be no one should ever be "inconvenienced" by anyone else. I'm also not so sure you'll be able to kite in between zones with sharding being a thing.
---
Yes I agree. 
---
 &gt;playing with pug casters
---
They win the healer item every time and say "lol sry m8 didn't notice"
---
Personally I can't wait for loot trading. 
---
Say a warrior and rogue goes to UBRS. The warrior has the Dal'rend set but doesn't equip it. The rogue has nothing like the scrub he is. One of the swords drop and every melee rolls on them, including the warrior who has them, but he rolls to give the sword to his rogue mate. This IS ninjaing but incredibly hard to detect. 
---
One solution would be to enforce the unique characteristic across the entire character. If you have the sword in your bag you can't loot it, but if it's in your bank, you can. Change this and you'll solve that problem at least for unique items. 
---
Another solution would be to have the loot sharing disappear once you exit the dungeon or maybe if you equip it, kinda like a second soulbound. That way people can't funnel loot.
---
I mean I love the postal service, but did Owl City really rip them off?
---
While limited in sample size given that postal service only came together for one album, I feel like the themes and tones of their music were far darker and anxious than Owl City.
---
I don't mean this as a judgement, because Owl City (his early stuff anyways) is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me when I'm feeling really sad and don't want to be- his music is so damn happy and hopeful in a way that a band whose only album is named "Give Up" I don't think is trying to be. 
---
Just seems like a bit of a reach to call it a rip off; derivative, maybe. Rip off? I don't think so.
---
It's marketing genius, like getting somebody hooked on drugs.
---
By the time you're doing UBRS you really should have a guild, but if you really wanna pug it, I guess you're right. I agree with the whole equipping it soulbounds it, because then all you have to do is ask the warrior to equip it real quick.
---
I mean free to play is like a trial, free to play has like 5-10% of the game.
---
Well true but ORSR also has new content
---
Well, Fury is pretty much the best DPS spec in the game, but you should definitely use world buffs and full consumables to get the most out of it. In the beginning Mages are pretty mediocre, but you can still do ok DPS if you're using a Flask. From AQ onwards when mages go Fire they really start doing some great dps. The truth is, in Vanilla, consumables (and world buffs!) play a huge part in the performance of the whole raid. 
---
Casters/Healers definitely have an easier time in terms of consumables than Melee. And if you go prot warrior, you get to use all the fury consumables AND all the tank consumables. Fun times! 
---
In my experience, with world buffs and full consumables Fury is the best DPS spec in the game. Without world buffs, mages start pulling ahead of melee in AQ. 
---
Thanks for your reply. Loot Trading is not a necessary evil I believe though. Just no loot trading &amp; no GM ticket support for loot. That is also solving cost cutting targets. If Private Servers run without loot trading, so can Blizzard.
---
If they are afraid of tickets - just state it clearly that there will be no support. We could agree to one subtle change: relocate the need button somewhat, so it's not right next to Greed. That would prevent most honest mistakes, the rest are clear ninja and visible to see.
---
Yeah lord knows I won't go into any 60 dungeon/raid as a pug. Luckily as a warlock I need few items from UBRS (only the trinket I believe). Just run DM a bunch of times with the guild. 
---
I can see why puggers are worried about the shared loot though. Hell I've done it myself in Wrath, needing on items to pass to a friend. We'll see how Blizzard will fix it.
---
Mass AOE pulling in groups to abuse dynamic respawn for example. Pull 20+ mobs, kill them, wait a couple seconds, repeat.
---
On the other hand you have Nano, lead quality assurance on Nost saying himself alot of the data is simply guessed and he expects Classic to be different in some areas. 
---
Noone says p realm are completely off, but lets stop pretending Classic will be exactly like private servers.
---
Exactly. Retail players doesn’t know
---
Why not keep Tailoring and get 18 slot mooncloth bags? Its not the most efficient but it will give you the best bags in the game early on, so you never have to worry about it again. 
---

*after it went f2p(limited) and on mobile*  
---
:)  
---
feral tanking is certainly viable and not some memeshit like ret.
---
I dont think it'll slow the development, but it'll certainly slow down the customer support, and in general ruin the morale within the team.
---
Now I remember all those shills saying a 40% stock drop is no big deal. Hmm.
---
I'm thinking of going warlock. How are they early on? I've heard they scale well with gear and get better later. Also what professions are best suited for warlock? I was thinking herb/alch to start to make gold.
---
oh no what a travesty  
---
i bet they can't wait to sell data on what items you look up the most to chinese gold farmers  
---
The game will get made but I doubt we'll get many GMs. 
---
did it have sharding though?
---
Unbelievable, according to blizzard there is no technology in 2019 to run mmo without a sharding. and we need to accept it.
---
Also we'd like to intoduce loot trading, convenient right click automated report system, scuffed content release, no progressive itemization, legion client.
---
we are a small indie company, you know, we can't afford any of what osr does and we need to cut costs. there is literally NO OTHER way to do it, so just accept it, we are doing our best.
---
~
---
As far as i know, OSRS got some awesome dev team, thats why they double in size. which want to preserve the spirit of the game, instead of blizzard which wants to integrate this game into their modern bullshit systems.
---
1 paladin?
---
This doesn't affect development teams.
---
You did delete all your videos at one point so nobody can really prove anything anymore. 
---
Mental illness is a horrible struggle. What's portrayed on the outside is often enough a lot less worse than what's going on on the inside. 
---
Fury was also crap until weapon normalization, that's why you didn't see them often.
---
&gt; Unbelievable, according to blizzard there is no technology in 2019 to run mmo without a sharding. and we all need to accept it, you know.
---
Not understanding why sharding is necessary is almost willful ignorance and disinformation at this point.
---
Ah, sorry, I got a bit confused in this comment chain.
---
All of this was super well explained during the blizzcon panel that you can view whenever you want on YouTube.
---
With some luck it kills retail 
---
No, there won’t be achievements.
---
&gt; Sure, when OSRS had no changes it was actually dying
---
Lol
---
Hopefully whoever came up with the azerite reforging costs is first to walk the plank 
---
no, why would there be achievements?
---
There won't be achievements and Classic characters will be completely separate from current characters.
---
So i know who i want to talk with and who not
---
 So i know who i want to talk with and who not 
---
Just to add a little perspective, it's worth noting that Activision Blizzard employs 9,600 workers.  
---
Retail dying does not help Classic. It makes classic fail also. The infrastructure that will be used for Classic will be the same as retail. So if retail stops then classic will struggle on its own to remain profitable. 
---
Let’s be honest with ourselves, blizzard will never listen to the community like jagex has continued to lul
---
No and they shouldn't be anyway.
---
What has that to do with achievements?
---
His humor can be a bit overkill, but his editing skills are very on point
---
True, but it's an easier baseline to start with, especially since the perspective of a profit driven company like Activision and a nostalgia driven fan base will have wildly divergent viewpoints on what a 'bad change' is (case and point being the current auto-report function discussion).
---
It's easier to have a hard line, and only look at improving that after the fact and you can analyse how it is working out in reality. 
---
Tinkering too early gets you in the mindset, and then individual agendas (such as the marketing team, etc) may start to sneak in then take the reins once the behaviour has become normalised.
---
Omg, I die Everytime he says it
---
Everything
---
And why is that worse than role playing as a cow or some shit
---
Yep,  this is the difference 
---
I know what the difference is, but i don't fancy a pointless discussion regarding keeping share holders happy. I know what i have seen at several (publicly listed companies) and that does confirm my point, but i guess you have different experiences and that is fine. 
---
Necessary? Lol, please explain how sharding is even close to a ''necessary'' feature.
---
If they do, private servers here I come!
---
Not saying this is directly related, but this is what i was afraid for: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/activision-is-said-to-plan-job-cuts-as-sales-of-key-games-stall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/activision-is-said-to-plan-job-cuts-as-sales-of-key-games-stall)
---
You laugh, but he is right.. I have played osrs simce release and when there were no changes for around a year the concurrent player count fell below 10k online at any time.. as soon as they started updating the game in the 'oldschool spirit' it has had a constant increase in players. 
---
But why is that way worse than role playing as a cow or some shit
---
because you're playing a character vs shoehorning yourself into a character  
---
pathetic as it gets, and all selfinsertfuggs are self conscious about it while shaming everyone else, when they are actually the worst 
---
Free to play is like 5% of the game or less and was only included in the last couple of years, and the game has had great success before the release of mobile so I fail to see your point.
---
Nope it has been successful since way before mobile released 
---
Why would you intentionally handicap yourself by not choosing a powerful racial? That's pretty fucking stupid, like not using all your cooldowns to win a duel. The only thing that matters is winning.
---
nobody is arguing whether its successful or not tho  
---
Duel spec is everything but small quality of life improvement lol.....it's HUGE
---
Classic was about real ROLE playing not playing ALL the roles at the drop of a switch. Yeah, you could regardless if you really wanted to, it had its price and it was completely fine that way.
---
New content that stays true to the oldschool spirit of the game, thats a huge factor to realise here. 
---
lol why would they lay off people who make the money? this is called trimming the fat, you kick out the people who do fuck all or jobs that are not directly related to cash income
---
Unfortunately it'll most likely be QA and customer support that goes first.
---
What makes you think that an AI can easily differentiate between a bot and a real person at a super low cost?
---
This so much, op says as if dual spec is a small adjustment but it’s actually huge.
---
This!! 
---
Hopefully down the line if they decide to make more content for classic.  
---
Either Dual spec or low respec cost. As it is currently its just bad design preventing people from fully enjoying the game in various game types it provides.  
---
Inspect people if you want to see their achievements...
---
There is nothing to realize and its quite obvious. Yes the content in OSRS is in spirit of the old game. And obviously the same would be needed with WoW. However: 
---
Its not he best argument against naysayers that WoW classic has gonna have great player retention if your counter example has nothing to do with the subject on the hand. Especially if you also consider the no changes thing, which many peolpe also include new content.
---
Oh right I misunderstood then, thanks for the explanation
---
when you think Role Playing stands for playing dps, heal or tank exclusively  
---
lmao 
---
thats a super convenient excuse for you to play something illegally for free my friend :)  
---
I didn't say exclusively but it is a part of it nonetheless.
---
&gt;dual spec 
---
Well done killing versatile hybrid specs.
---
no? 
---
I know right?
---
But seriously. I've been waiting for Classic since the day it was announced. If they fuck it up, I'm not gonna let Blizz prevent me from playing Classic. If they can't even rerelease a game back the way it was in 2006 then they are a shitty company. Classic WoW is one of the easiest, no risk involved money grabs they ever had. If they fuck it up, it's their fault.
---
When OSRS came out it was great bit within a few months they brought the voting system in and I don't recognise the game anymore so much new shit. 
---
Stopped playing after a year. #nochanges 
---
YMMV but I feel differently about dual-spec, your class is your class not what spec you happen to be.  I don't agree in punishment/penalty (paying 50g at the top of it) as a vehicle for nostalgia and immersion.  Perhaps a lengthy cooldown of 48hrs or 72hrs but always liked the idea of dual spec.  
---
Probably this is only an issue for people who raid regularly in a traditional sense where you **need** to spec protection in some cases as a warrior depending on the turnout or lack of critical classes to progress events even if you're traditionally more of an arms or fury DPS type of player.
---
The reasons behind the re-training aspect were probably not because of any semblance of role-playing/immersion/etc but more to keep people spending in-game currency so they'd need to earn more, so they'd play more, rinse and repeat. 
---
[I explained it all here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aje556/why_sharding_sucks/eeusx5l/)
---
I'm laughing because with how toxic the #nochanges crowd can be, I can see this never happening for Classic.
---
Full t2 is a highly visible achievement 
---
levitate only works for the priest himself.
---
They could do a separate Gurubashi Arena. Keep the same FFA model, but let the tryhards have their own arena.
---
Spell power rogues 
---
Yes your old achievements will carry over, for example, [Level 120], [Jewelcrafting Master] and [Looking for more] complete with perky pug for pet battles.
---
It may happen. It may not happen. If they do it they'll probably do a fresh server and let you keep your 60.
---
They may add more Vanilla raids, but I doubt it.
---
A good rogue won't pull aggro.

My second character. First character I ever leveled to max. RIP. Lost control of the account and I can't seem to recover it. Started playing WoW a few months before the release of BC. 
---
Just because something works for one game, doesn't automatically mean it works for every MMO out there.
---
I'm carefully optimistic, though.
---
I don't agree but understand your point of view.
---
Isn't this the second time in a couple of months? I definitely recall something like this happening earlier as well.
---
I’ll just echo the thought that dual spec is not a small change, it has ramifications in every aspect of the game. It’s likely you’ll have to level 2 toons if you want to dps and tank as prot MT.
---
Find a balance, be MT full time, or tank in dps spec so you can do both. Or find a way to hoard obscene amounts of money. Or, again, level a 2nd toon.
---
Yeah, I don't really know much about frost, but I remember doing great damage with low gear in aq40 on a private server. And i remember a few dreamfoil consumes and firefins, but not too much (compared to shadow priest, which needed a ton of stuff for fights like loatheb)... in contrast, Fury could be a disaster, and that's before farming ironfoe or raid trash for weapons.
---
WOW, you are the best.  I didn't know such a site existed.  I actually found my first raiding character from April '05.   Joined a guild at lvl 10. Exactly one month later I was lvl 40 and I joined my raiding guild.    That was unexpected, I thought that didn't happen until lvl 50ish.  then I stayed in that guild for eternity. (In my mind) but actually it was just 16 months!   It felkt like 3 years, because we went all the way from 5 mans, MC, BWL, AQ to Naxx (not finished)  in that period of time.  In sept. 2006 I am listed as unguilded, and a week later I joined the resident pvp guild, because  we were unmotivated to keep wiping on Naxx bosses, and people wanted to have some time to use the hard earned pve gear in other situations, like battlegrounds. 
---
It seems in the first week of TBC, I was lvl 65, and joined a PVE guild again, but a different one. That also a surprise, I was sure I started PVE in my old guild, and only when we found out the transition from 40 man to 10 and 25 man raids wasn't going that well people split up and   scattered, guilds reformed and merged etc.  But this data says I already moved on at lvl 65.   Guild drama went on and a month later after another split up, we moved to yet another guild,  and that one would be my home for TBC raiding, although at some point I stopped raiding hardcore and went casual.  Last guild listed is from 2008, early WotK 
---
Frostadamus. He is pretty interesting as well as Madseasonshow. 
---
Blizz is going to emulate the debuff limit from vanilla, why would they ADD something as game-changing as dual spec?
---
Nobody said it's no big deal, of course it is. Most people however were saying that it was because of diablo immortal (which is ridiculous, if anything it would go up because of that). The people you call "shills" were simply saying that the stock went down because of CoD and overall drops in the gaming sector.
---
Yeah this is the second time hearing about it for me too. I'm guessing it's the same thing but I don't know like you said that was like 4-7 weeks ago.
---
Sounds like you don't like classic.
---
#VICTORY FOR SYLVANAS 
---
Because they constantly update the game by giving players the choices of what is implemented.
---
If they kept it at its base 2013 version it would have died off years ago.
---
Pretty sure they won't. Highlighting the differences between old vanilla and current retail, especially regarding convenience and QoL, is part of the strategy to trick Classic subs into buying new xpacs. Classic is merely a bait to hook retired players again. Growing the subcount is nice but ultimately they probably hope to sell more BFA boxes in the process, from the hype and the waiting till this summer and later from the content drought between classic stages. 
---
lol. If only.
---
I think we should replace the term "quality-of-life improvements with "game breaking non-vanilla mechanic" as that is far more accurate to what it is.
---
So you asked
---
&gt;Do you think blizzard should incorporate small ** game breaking non-vanilla mechanism** such as dual spec?
---
And the obvious answer is no. 
---
The respecc cost is one of the few gold sinks in classic, and it crucial to slow down inflation. 
---
You might be thinking of the "voluntary" leaving? Employees would get a year's salary for quitting on their own, or something along those lines. I don't remember if there were reports of many taking this opportunity.
---
Some of us had decent hardware in 2005.  I remember getting an old 19 inch office RGB monitor, might even have been 21 inch, because the office switched to flatscreens.  (still 4:3 aspect ratio)  That thing could easily handle 1600x1200 or 1280x1024 and I am sure World of Warcraft could too. 
---
I loved classic, I just never liked the weekly 50g penalty to spec protection for MC raids.
---
We need another plague 😢
---
Thanks, that makes sense and adds some perspective.
---
God I hope not.
---
None in classic.
---
Why would Diablo Immortal, the biggest fail in Blizzard recents history, push stock prices upwards?
---
Those names are great, because they filter out a good chunk of all the people you don't want to play with. Just find a mature guild that doesn't accept kids with those kind of names and you will be fine. You can than also just avoid them in 5 man pugs. 
---
Mentioned that in the original post lol
---
You can scan the entire browsing habit of registered users through cookies. They are able to see what Youtube videos I watch if I am logged into their service at the same time.
---
Perhaps this is the case, I think there's also a lot we don't know about the release details.  They certainly won't roll out the old 1.12.1 code and re-release it either so at the least technical changes will be made, though I'd imagine a driving push to keep *with the spirit* of classic which is OK with me.
---
Personally I liked fury/DPS style of playing a warrior over anything else, but I liked protection too and I wouldn't consider rolling two of the same class to get around role versatility.  I'd probably just go with protection.
---
That’s the thing with media they like to hype the number not the % of staff. To me this is a corporation going through efficiency changes and nothing more. I am sure they will also still be recruiting key staff for certain projects
---
Jagex ruined OSRS. First of all the original name was 2007scape. The whole point of the game was to go back to a time in the game where there was no GE (or an auction house in wow terms). Players had to meet up in the world and actually trade items and engage in social interaction. Does this sound familiar? GE ~ Dungeon finder.
---
Players created third party websites basically mimicking an auction house and jagex caved and added it to the game to please casual players. Players who couldn't be assed to google. Players who objectively didn't like the game and it's core values to begin with.
---
Then they added God wars dungeon and all the overpowered items that come with it. Previously the combat triangle was pretty balanced. There was no crazy oneshot kills. Then you add these OP power creeped items back into the game and you start an arms race. If melee gets god swords well shouldn't mage and range get new stuff also? Does this not sound familiar?
---
These changes were just the tip of the iceberg. Player numbers were dropping so they made the game free to play. As with any free to play mmo, once you open the gates the flood of bots begin to appear. You can't stop them because they can always make new accounts. To top it off they added player bonds, the ingame equivalent of a wow token. So you could make armies of free bots to farm gold to buy membership without ever spending a dime and transfer it to your main account. This succeeded in artificially inflating their player count allowing them to brag about how well the game was doing. Lies.
---
Then they added zulrah. This was a custom made solo boss that dropped unique loot to the game. Killing this boss was so efficient there was no reason to do anything else in the game. This was when new features began to overtake the entire old game. Why would I ever bother fishing when this boss drops more fish then I could possibly ever catch.
---
Power creep has completely overtaken everything to the point where the game is unrecognizable from its 2007 counterpart. It's not the same game at all and I won't play it.
---
The revenue they would get from a mobile game will probably sound good in earning calls. 
---
Cause it might be wanted in other parts of this world?
---
People who want to use options in a predatory manner........
---
Selling his body. As a gnome mage I was always very happy with a warm warrior body to hide behind out on those dangerous streets of Stratholme. 
---
It will be good for everyone. If more people are working ( mining, herbing etc) there will be more competition on the seller side, and hopefully the prices will be lower because of that. As long as the AH is not controlled by very few people that is. 
---
having a pet is always great, esp. once you get voidwalker
---
You mean the same incredible revenue BfA is rolling in? Subscriptions are at an alltime low. 
---
guess you better logout of every site then  
---
Not even remotely the same thing.
---
Literally every company is doing that right now. We just had a “trim the fat” budget cut at my company even though we are profitable. Can always make more profit. 
---
that's not what RP stands for  
---
Exactly and the tech sector is going through a tough time as a whole, I am sure across the industry similar redundancies are taking place but the sheer size of blizzard makes this headlines
---
note, if you are doing this to get full thunderbluff reputation, you can wait until you get to level 5 before going there

I saw a video of someone kiting it past splinter tree then south into the barrens almost to the xroads then east to durotar and north to Org. By the time they got it there it was half health. My way takes like 15 minutes. 
---
Yeah but stating it as a "small quality-of-life" is just misleading. It would rebalance large parts of the game... That is in no way a small quality of life
---
&gt;I think we should replace the term "quality-of-life improvements with "game breaking non-vanilla mechanic" as that is far more accurate to what it is.
---
It seems to be what many think it means atleast.
---
I didn't say that I particularly care. Especially because if I did I could just block it. However you seem to have misunderstood the issue OP had, so I figured I'd correct your statement.
---
Crits chance is lootbox gaming, Warriors off the table for me I guess
---
It likely won't, they know they can boost their sub numbers dramatically with Classic.
---
OSRS’s player base would be on life support if they hadn’t done that, so hopefully if classic wow ever has a similar problem once progression ends people change their tune. 
---
If you think add-ons carry you through mythic it's pretty clear that youve barely done it
---
No king rules forever my son.
---
I could see them maybe lowering the gold cap on respec but I highly doubt they are going to give us dual spec. 
---
Worst was struggling to find a decent raiding guild back then that would take me without me having to heal
---
Lmao I hope someone archives the old comment section and uses them. Wowhead has literally never contributed anything of worth to the community besides buying out every competitor and profiting off volunteer work.
---
Honestly, with the right click report feature. .. probably.  I have a feeling that any of the harmless fun we used to have when we were bored and ran out of things to do will get us banned. Ganking, wall walking and sneaking into where we shouldn’t be, raiding major cities...
---
Fresh server + TBC
---
I don't think having to go engi to keep up with everyone ranking is a hard choice, it's the only choice or you'll be in a heavy disadvantage
---
Because it will crush sales in asian markets, where mobile gaming is insanely popular. When Brendan Greene was being grilled on H3 podcast about expanding his development team, he straight up said that most people in south korea want to code and develop for mobile games, and its actually hard to find quality people to develop for pc and consoles. 
---
     Kinda like how the Warcraft movie was made for china, hence it crushed over there, Diablo Immortal will make blizzard stacks on stacks on stacks in the AS region.
---
Blizzard finally entering mobile market, investors see revenue. The stock price of the company blizzard partnered with actually went up after the announcement.
---
Class balance wise that's simply not accurate
---
everything on your IP is recorded and can be traced back, even if you change IP  
---
so its all meaningless in the end  
---
Hi, /u/jamal-or-yas
---
I had a brand new Dell XPS with a 21” LCD monitor. Still using the monitor at work. It was the first thing I ever financed. 
---
Method getting WF with classes that aren't using the maximised damage spec and instead bring utility kinda counters your point on live.
---
They literally brought hunters in a spec that deals less damage because their utility was invaluable, generally raids will bring a combination of strong damage and healing and strong utility to deal with mechanics. Vanilla was much more about the numbers you can pump
---
&gt; Having 4-5 classes out of 10 being able to do viable dps when every single class has at least one spec designed to do dps is absolute trash balance. The balance isn't perfect on retail, but it's a hell of a lot better than it was in vanilla. 
---
Not at all.  I don't consider homogenization of classes better balance. 
---
But customer support staff at Blizzard are so nice... 😢
---
all the spirit you got, including all spirit on gear and buffs. world buffs included.
---
I always loved looking at artwork of the mills
---
We don't know how they'll do black lotus yet however if it's anything like nostalrius most players are in for a very rude awakening when they go to buy the consumables their guild told them to bring and they see the price tag.
---
You probably heard this 1000x times, but if you want to take raiding at least a bit seriously, engineering gives you a huge damage boost. For a serious mage player, tailoring+skinning(which you reroll to engi at 60) is a must. But if you just play for fun, feel free to do whatever :)
---
Don't they let the playerbase vote on changes? Think I read that somewhere.
---
Why not make a few extra realms and merge them later? Or just have server caps and queues, and just let the initial chaos be well.. chaotic and flooded by players. I honestly think that sharding is never a solution to anything, and it will never make the game better in any capacity.
---
Because mobile gaming has alot more mass appeal than a PC game, especially in the market they're apparently going after (Asia)
---
What??? Engineering literally costs 100-200g entirely from auction house in few hours and Sapper Charges are INSANE for AoE fights. I dont want to be offensive, but if you say there is next to no benefit in PvE, you dont really know what you are talking about. And thats not even considering pvp benefits.
---
Wise man. Also reroll skinning to engi at 60.
---
Sure I can agree with that, let me update the question then.
---
It's very beautiful, I love how it captures the doom and gloom of the place.
---
Man, this reminds me of the all the beautiful zones in Classic wow haha
---
With all those binds in the bottom left, he still prefers clicking on the bottom right bar.
---
&gt; Why not make a few extra realms and merge them later?
---
If you have to ask then you haven't been playing WoW for very long. If there's anything players hate more than sharding is realm destruction via merging.
---
Also, hilarious that you'd say “just a few.” That's not how this works at all. You'd need *hundreds* of realms at launch in order to maintain Blizz-like pop caps without sharding!
---
&gt; Or just have server caps and queues
---
So let 90% of players not be able to play the game for the first week? I can't have a conversation with someone who has their head so far up there ass that they think this is reasonable, ethical, and not adolescent as fuck.
---
&gt; I honestly think that sharding is never a solution to anything, and it will never make the game better in any capacity.
---
Then please don't install the game and instead stick to private servers.
---
Or better yet, give *yourself* a log-in queue, preferably for a week so no one has to suffer these smooth-brain takes in Tradechat at launch.
---
How do you know that?
---
Wouldn’t be the worst thing, id be fine with getting steamrolled by those abomination elites in ghost lands again. I’m interested to see how Blizz plays it for sure 
---
Do you guys even have jobs?
---
Amazing
---
This post ..ugh. Did you even play vanilla?
---
Why are you complaining about no news? Why is this a bad thing? This has been discussed a thousand times, no news (for now) is good news. 
---
Summer does not mean June. There is plenty of time.
---
I keep trying to log in but it just reverts me to the wowhead homepage then whenever I click classic it just logs me out :l I hope it gets fixed soon
---
I mean, sure it's funny for a moment... but if you're a lowbie flying into Org to train after leveling... you don't wanna deal with a dragon or whatever other shit someone kited there to grief everyone.
---
I'd say there's a 99.9% chance they've learned from their mistakes and fix stuff like this when they release their version of "vanilla"
---
classic wont be released
---
It's silly. But I watched it to the end :D because I used to watch this as a kid. At the time I found it extremely funny, and the other wow machinima (stupid word!) videos.
---
I was more happy for the guy doing the video and singing, because he was just being goofy and free and didn't held himself back! He was being himself and having fun so innocently \^\_\^ that's what made this video sweet to watch for me again in 2019.
---
Blessings to everyone :)
---
I can find something in any expansion that I dont like. Doesnt mean I hate them all. I really like the respec costs though, makes you forced to plan ahead and doesnt make everything so accessible without working for it.
---
Evidence? 
---
Source on debuff limit?
---
That wasn't mentioned st Blizzcon and I haven't read anything new since.
---
76% of statistics is made up.
---
The same crow of no change people existed in the early days of osrs community, they are a vocal minority who's opinions were overshdowed due to the implementation of a voting/ polling system (75% to pass) for any future updates. Now i doubt blizz will do the same in a voting system, but the fact remains that giving the community a voice in this sense is undoubtedly healthy for the long term future of the game. 
---
Horde leveling is maybe marginally more streamlined (IMO) simply because of the flight path placement and ease of travel being a bit improved. I think there are also slightly more quests on the horde side if im remembering correctly. 
---
But, honestly, if you pick a faction based on this factor you’re doing it wrong. You’re going to be sub-60 for a long-ass time either way, better to pick a faction based on which one’s lore you like more, the feel of their hub, and how much you like their zones. 
---
&gt; long ass-time

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
---
&gt; The game was booted back to its original state in 2007.
---
Runescapes original state was from 2001-2004. Get off my lawn.
---
No, but there will be an addon.  People lose their shit if Blizz does it, but players are going to do it anyway.
---
you just know he tried and failed ganking a low hp orc lock and is forever triggered lol
---
Love it!!
---
\&gt; If you have to ask this question, then you haven't been playing WoW for very long.   
---
Ive been playing for more than a decade, thanks.   
---
\&gt; If there's anything players hate more than sharding it's realm  destruction via mergers. Holy shit do people cry when their realms get  merged and the communities are destroyed.   
---
What? Ive played on a low pop server for a long time, and it was great when we merged with 2 other servers. The community grew and most people were happy. Its not like there was much community left anyway considering low pop + sharding and LFG/LFR etc. If anything it saved what community was left.  
---
\&gt; Also, *“just a few?”* You'd need *hundreds* of realms at launch in order to maintain Blizz-like pop caps without sharding! You really have no clue, do you?   
---
I dont think Blizzlike pop caps are the way to go. Id like a pop cap around 8k per server. Hundreds is pushing it, but around 100 sure.  
---
\&gt; You seriously want to stop a huge percentage of players from starting  the game? What the fuck, dude. This is the kind of take that makes me  think someone has their head so far up their ass they can't even tell  what day it is.   
---
No need to be so aggressive just because someone has a different opinion lol. No, I think with population caps some people would naturally choose other servers instead of just the two biggest ones. And if someone must play on the biggest server, then let them? We still have queues today occasionally in retail.  
---
I really dont mind an hour queue, and the population will probably settle down eventually. If I cant play the first week well so what? Ill start playing 2 weeks in instead, not a big deal
---
The same no change people were up in arms at the start of oldschool. That quickly got overshadowed when a voting system was implemented, sadly blizzard most likely will never follow suit. 
---
zones and dungeons!
---
He doesn't know a single name of who was layed off.  But that won't stop him.
---
Which was a really great thing for PvP because it made you pick your engagements a lot more carefully knowing your opponent could potentially have full world buffs with 7000 HP.
---
It was mentioned at Blizzicon at Classic panel, Personally I feel no limit would be better since its making whole specs and items pointless. But I guess it was part of the classic experience, however stupid it may be.
---
we can only hope i guess, i have 0 intresst in tbc and would really like a osrs progressive vanilla model. Would even pay a dedicated 20$ sub for that.
---
Who decides what gets voted on and what doesn't? How granular does the voting get?
---
Because that system is either the most dog-and-pony-show pacifier, or a micromanagement nightmare.
---
Most likely it just means he has modifiers like 1, Shift+1, Ctrl+1, Alt+1, and the actionbar does not display this.
---
In addition
---
T1: Hunter, Priest, Rogue (mostly), Shaman
---
T2: Rogue (mostly), Shaman
---
Not necesarily BIS but acceptable
---
Rogue for T3
---
You can dps, ot and mt just fine as a druid.
---
Make Love, Not Warcraft was peak Southpark, change my mind.
---
It was harmless fun for you, doubt all the lowbies in Org appeciated getting fucked up by a max level elite dragon though lol. 
---
Sure it was fun to see once... but kiting a dragon to a capital is literally the definition of griefing.
---
&gt; I dont think Blizzlike pop caps are the way to go. Id like a pop cap around 8k per server. Hundreds is pushing it, but around 100 sure.
---
So you want changes. For an increase like that you'd have to implement dynamic spawn rates or completely rework all resource / mob spawns, or add more.
---
&gt; No need to be so aggressive just because someone has a different opinion lol.
---
You're literally copping an elitist, gate-keeping attitude. Why the fragile, snowflake response as soon as someone's willing to call you on your B.S.?
---
&gt; If I cant play the first week well so what? Ill start playing 2 weeks in instead, not a big deal
---
Please do us all a favor and not play for two weeks, regardless of sharding. :D
---
Yep, they do. You need membership and some minimal skill lvl (not sure how much now) to participate.
---
Shockadin
---
It's literally the definition of griefing though? lol I'm amazed at how many people are self centered enough to think because it's fun for them to do it, then anyone complaining is just a whiney bitch who doesn't appreciate your brand of "fun"
---
It was funny to see once, not so funny when it happens repeatedly and makes it impossible to hit org after leveling to train skills or whatever.
---
Or you know, people could group up to go through the initial zones? Like how mmo's are meant to be played. Some gather quests might be a hassle, but people rarely complete an **entire** zone before moving to another.
---
It isn't necessary at all and it just paves a way for Blizzard to open "pandora's box" and fuck up the only game that might redeem their company.
---
Nostalrius for example had to implement sharding because of the massive population congregating on just one server. With populations exceeding 12k+ on just one server, yes then I understand that sharding is necessary.
---
But with Classic, we'll see **full** servers of 2k, 3k people? Blizzard's max population per server has always been 2k. With 6 starting zones, I hardly see sharding as necessary. People want classic, because for the most part it was the community that made vanilla such a great experience. Implement sharding and you're basically taking a shit on the community aspect of it.
---
This is my opinion, just as you gave your opnion on the matter.
---
This is completely false. The XP bar staying upon hitting 60 was part of the game for a very long time.
---
You can see the same thing here, in what is a video of one of the first Ragnaros kills in Europe. In the future, you should probably fact check before writing dumb shit on the Internet.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCb8Lg6G59U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCb8Lg6G59U)
---
This is something Blizzard can't provide. I'm all for changes, just not developed by the same people who brought us the current installment of the game.
---
I know that exact experience with a few GM's, really frustrating when someone can't just be a direct human being with you. Some of those raid leaders and officers will tend to just operate on a different level that just doesn't feel human.   
---
   
---
My last guild I was in I was in the Beta team. The GM of the guild/ alpha team was really nice and we would play pubg together. Very respectful and would talk to you about anything. That's the kind of guild I wanna be in
---
True, but they should have seperate servers for that though. You should be able to **copy** your character to a new progression server, whilst still keeping your character on the locked classic server.
---
Priest's T1 is pretty bad for the most part.
---
I am 27 now. I have a small family and a 50 hour/week systems analyst job. I'll probably take a week off of work to play when it launches. I assume I will get about 2 hours a day max until the weekends to play besides that(at least i'll enjoy it for a long time, right?).
---
I have a few friends and co-workers who will be playing. I doubt my friends who played vanilla with me will play classic. I expect to start a Facebook group near launch day and invite people who I know are buying classic to it. Then we can communicate what server to join on launch. I hope to recruit at least 5 people. 
---
It is sad though, that my closest friends probably won't be joining me in Azeroth again...
---
He's just bilingual mate
---
No there are no achievements. Those didnt come from wotlk. Youll have to just know what gear looks like to see if they have been to a certain raid or not.
---
Its not about "link me your xx achievement for invite" 
---
More about "lfm MC" and then just going off of word of mouth and judgement. Like you would in the actual world...of warcraft.
---
This is absolutely fucking awesome!!!!!
---
Dear lord.  Just listened to him and fell asleep in 5 min.. love it
---
Shockadins didn't exist in vanilla. Shockadins were a TBC thing. 
---
In vanilla holy shock has a 30 second cooldown. You pretty much can only use it as a finisher. 
---
In TBC Holy Shock was on a 15 second cooldown and it could be coupled with Sanctity aura, which it could not in Vanilla. That is the true shockadin spec. But I guess if you're rolling with 3 paladins and one is ret you will have sanc aura anyway.
---
But still, 30 seconds for your only long range damage ability is too long a cooldown to do much of anything.
---
They have community managers who gauge what the community is interested in before it's put up to be voted for. That way, it's usually stuff that is heavily liked and likely to pass even before it's bought to the table. 
---
\&gt; So you want changes.   
---
When did I state the opposite??   
---
\&gt; For an increase like 8k, you'd have to implement dynamic spawn rates or  completely rework all resource / mob spawns. It sounds like you haven't  thought about the ramifications of your ideas.   
---
Nice assumptions. I have thought about it, and dynamic spawn rates is one solution. Faster spawn rates in general (for certain mobs, not all) is another.  
---
\&gt; You're literally copping an elitist, gate-keeping attitude. Why the  fragile, snowflake response as soon as someone's willing to call you on  your B.S.?   
---
Elitist? How exactly is not wanting sharding elitist? I want lots of people to experience classic, but I want them to experience it in what I believe to be the best or most enjoyable way possible.   
---
If anyone is being elitist here its you. Constantly throwing around personal attacks for no reasons, screaming because your views are challenged. You call me fragile, when you cant even take the smallest amount of criticism. Ironic, isnt it?  
---
Wanting to keep players from playing the game at launch just to protect your little fantasy nostalgia of what Vanilla was like at for the first few days is... asinine. And immature as fuck.
---
&gt; If anyone is being elitist here its you. Constantly throwing around personal attacks for no reasons
---
That's... not what elitist means, lol.
---
You're simply wrong. I raided through aq40 as a mage in vanilla and an ele sham got the first claw of chromagus in our guild.
---
While the west doesn't overly care, Diablo Immortal will probably earn huge revenue in China, which is the market it's aimed at. The issue was announcing it at Blizzcon, if it had been announced at a Chinese mobile event Diablo Immortal would have probably had an incredible reaction and the stock price would have most likely climbed.
---
Every class will use tier 3, but Prot War And Hunter are the only classes that use 8/8 tier 1/2/3 because the set bonuses are all good. 
---
Tier 1 is really bad for every other class. Mages for example don’t need a single piece of tier 1. 
---
Tier 2 is a lot better. Here you see more classes aiming for tier items with some off piece items being better. But again only Prot War and Hunter aim for 8/8. 
---
Tier 2.5, finally this is where casters, rogues and fury wars will want a lot of tier pieces. Rogue 5/5 t2.5 with 3/8 t2 is extremely good. 
---
Tier 3 this is where everyone aims for tier 3 for the most part. So basically the higher you go in tier the more people use it. 
---
&gt; It's not about people neededing what they can not wear. It is about them neededing what they can wear but actually don't need. And trading to someone else. 
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but petty sure can only trade stuff to people whom were in the group at the time the boss dropped his loot. 
---
I get the feeling you never actually ran a pick up group dungeon in vanilla. Because it really was like a mini Cold War each time you grouped with people. Like making sure you were the only one of your class (and preferably armour type as well) then you had to travel over to the dungeon and the is if you managed ensure everyone was dungeon ready (e.g. was repaired, had consumables) then once you were in the dungeon you had to buff up and designate crowd control. You would probably also have to explain the boss tactic of every boss without a dungeon journal to help ya. 
---
&gt;Wanting to keep players from playing the game at launch just to protect your little fantasy nostalgia of what Vanilla was like at for the first few days is... asinine. And immature as fuck.
---
I just said I want changes did I not? I dont give a fuck what Vanilla was, I care about what Vanilla is going to be like, and for me sharding is not something Id like to be part of Vanilla or any other MMO.
---
&gt;If anyone is being elitist here its you. Constantly throwing around personal attacks for no reasons
---
When did I say that the two statements were connected? Just because I said one, doesnt mean the second one explains why you are being elitist.
---
You are being elitist by assuming everyone else is wrong, and that you have the moral high ground because you care about new players and not yourself. You think your views are above everyone else.
---
I want everyone to experience and enjoy Classic. Sharding is a horrible, immersion ruining feature. I hate it. I never even played wow back in 2004, so fuck off with your nostalgia argument.
---
OMG thnx for that link didn't know that site existed. So where to begin, started in vanilla, quit in Wotlk kinda suddenly cause of life. 
---
Then when i came back in WoD my old account was messed up and unable to recover it. So eventually caved i made a new one before WoD and was kinda excited about a fresh start.
---
So here where it gets amazing apperently my account was hacked and sold and whoever has it now has 120s and shit and never left my guild and last played in 2018. its like he tooke over my WoW life with missing a beat.
---
It was a joke really but even then 1 v 3 they'll have a hard time ccing all 3 and avoiding hammers of justice 
---
Great work!!
---
Nobody knows that, but when companies makes cuts it's usually for less "useful" positions that can easily be replaced.. like GM's, customer support, etc etc.
---

---
Please educate yourself. Thanks.
---
This is one of those things that is like ... Haha kazzak is in stormwind! ... for the first few times and then it just gets old and a pain in the ass by the 100th someone does it.
---
There's more incorrect information than there are accuracies.  Sorry you put so much effort into typing this up but it's wrong and useless.
---
The fresh server meme is something I hope stays on private servers. It's pure cancer and goes against everything an RPG is meant to be.
---
Huntards always go fullset.
---
Classic will be a joke.
---
Having fewer realms with larger caps and/or queues would also address most of the problems you mention, while not completely destroying the MMO aspect of the game. I'd rather have that, thank you.
---
Saying sharding is "necessary" is basically synonymous to saying Blizzard is incompetent.
---
&gt; Or you know, people could group up to go through the initial zones?
---
Doesn't work with Vanilla's lack of quest-mob sharing and default spawn rates. Grouping up in WoW is detrimental to your leveling experience because not only does it cut your gained XP in half (or more), most quest items in starting zones are not shared.
---
Also on this topic: The dirty secret of all private servers is that to ensure a smooth launch they all incorporate some form of dynamic spawns or artificially adjust the spawn rates of resource nodes and mobs to non-blizz-like levels, ha!
---
&gt; Like how mmo's are meant to be played.
---
Not WoW! Unless you want to go in and permanently recalibrate spawn rates, or add a dynamic spawn system. Having the full capacity of concurrent players in only six starter zones was *not* how WoW was designed to be played normally.
---
Furthermore, starting zones literally take an hour, maybe an hour and a half—tops. Not to mention that the actual Vanilla launch will never be replicated because for most people *there wasn’t even a proper launch*, due to realms crashing and log-in queues, etc. 
---
&gt;  it just paves a way for Blizzard to open "pandora's box"
---
This “fear” that cloning starter zones will lead to “shard-hopping” to multiple Kazzak’s for example, is almost willful ignorance and disinformation at this point.
---
&gt; the only game that might redeem their company.
---
Even the most cynical [investor analysts](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4237543-activision-blizzards-secret-weapon?amp_js_v=0.1) agree that:
---
&gt; ... the success (or failure) of Classic will not single handedly transform the company in a radical way.
---
So much for that!
---
&gt; Blizzard's max population per server has always been 2k. 
---
More misinformation. According to Mark Kern himself, pop caps at launch were 2.5k *concurrent* and were tweaked over the course of Vanilla to around 3.5-4k by 1.12.)
---
&gt; I hardly see sharding as necessary.
---
That's because you're stuck in the mindset of protecting some notion of levels 0-10 that never really existed. Additionally, I question your true interest in the game. If you actually cared, you'd care about a successful launch and the long term health of the game.
---
Sharding is the solution for grown ups who understand the compromises that need to be made in order to ensure the health of the game *for the long run.*
---
&gt; Implement sharding and you're basically taking a shit on the community aspect of it.
---
*Not* implementing sharding in starter zones means launching with a thousand realms (or hours-long log-in queues) just so people can play the game smoothly at launch—only to see every realm across the board turn into a ghost town three months later. And some people have the *gall* to talk about the *community*, while hoping for server merges and hours-long log-in queues. Myopic numbskulls, if you ask me. Not you, though. I'd never say anything bad about you.
---
&gt; This is my opinion, just as you gave your opnion on the matter.
---
Okay. Except my opinion is informed by history, articles, blue-posts, private server discoveries, etc.—and your opinion just seems woefully uninformed. Pretty much textbook feels-over-reals. *shrug*
---
Horde is quite a bit faster because they have more quests. Alliance struggle a lot between levels 40 and 50 due to a lack of quests. And Horde have a more optimal leveling route. Alliance is all over the place. But it’s not a colossal difference, maybe half a day of extra /played for Alliance. It should not be a dealbreaker. 
---
But the people working on classic are not the people who brought us the current installment?
---
Well shit we are fucked
---
Everything. Which is still close to nothing. 
---
Small QoL? Most likely. Things like spell queeing were in the demo. 
---
Dual spec? No chance in hell. 
---
&gt; I never even played wow back in 2004, so fuck off with your nostalgia argument.
---
LOL *it all makes sense now!*
---
It was incredibly rare. That's why so many people don't remember it existing.
---
You're correct in saying it was irrelevant in today's day and age, but there WILL be players who want it back specifically for the 1/1000 times a rogue's gouge hit a mage who blinked away.
---
It's not that big of a deal to 99% of players.
---
&gt;If you have to ask this question, then you haven't been playing WoW for very long.
---
&gt;You're literally copping an elitist, gate-keeping attitude.
---
:thinking:
---
he jus talkin shit
---
Man in the Normal WoW and also ffxiv subreddit but just bash me when I bring up classic WoW, like this game is gonna fail because people think they want it but dont but..... it's what I want, I hate cross realm dungeon finders and welfare epics I miss the community aspect of MMOs.
---
You are the embodiment of retail players mindset and will be what makes classic suck. 
---
Really nice! 
---
You don’t need to spec protection for MC
---
I think the problem is is that all the #nochanges vanilla fans don't trust the current Blizzard team to keep the classic/vanilla spirit.
---
If classic WoW is released #nochanges, and after 18 months they added new content that matched what vanilla was about (level cap remained at 60, no catch up mechanics etc) then I can see vanilla fans still enjoying the content.
---
At least they added old school servers in the first place. I wouldn't be surprised if there's another point in the future where they re-release old school servers all over again and go through the motions again.
---
I could see this working for classic WoW too. Fresh classic servers come out, 18-36 months later (whatever works) everything is reset or new classic servers are released again.
---
I be talked about it on this sub a few times, the undead zones are some of the best in the game. The ambience, music, terrain, enemies, quests, all do such a great job of making the world ironically come to life. Everything about deathknell, tirisfall, and silverpine is just fantastic. 
---
Love it!
---
Pssssh. 
---
I played Boomkin and I out DPS'd mages and rogues all the way through Naxx
---
/s
---
Why not demo and level super fast and easy? You’re just gonna pull agro on every mob with this spec.
---
You sure? I thought it originated from Half-Life 3 Syndrome.
---
I have 3 IRL friends who quit after BC, and 2 who quit after WOTLK. All 5 are coming back for Classic and said they'd be happy to play all the way through Classic.
---
&gt; Best way to make money......  ........ and NPC vendorable items
---
I recognize and agree with all your remarks, but what does the above one mean? 
---
&gt; Having fewer realms with larger caps
---
Unless you want to go in and permanently recalibrate spawn rates, or add a dynamic spawn system, you're asking for a huge nonBlizz-like experience. 
---
The dirty secret of all private servers is that to ensure a smooth launch they all incorporate some form of dynamic spawns or artificially adjust the spawn rates of resource nodes and mobs to non-blizz-like levels, ha!
---
&gt; and/or queues would also address most of the problems you mention
---
I'm not calling you asinine or immature. But I find it asinine and immature for someone to prefer a system where *most* players can't even log-in to play the game—just to protect the first hour that you're going to be in starting zones.
---
You do know that it takes like an hour, tops, to leave the starting zones right?
---
&gt; while not completely destroying the MMO aspect of the game.
---
Well, the WoW devs were way ahead of you. Grouping up in WoW is detrimental to your leveling experience because not only does it cut your gained XP in half (or more) but most quest items and mobs in starting zones are **not shared.**
---
&gt; I'd rather have that, thank you.
---
In that case I question your commitment to the game. If you *actually* cared, you'd care about a successful launch. Sharding is the solution for grown ups who understand the compromises that need to be made in order to ensure the health of the game for the long run.
---
&gt; Saying sharding is "necessary" is basically synonymous to saying Blizzard is incompetent.
---
*Not* implementing sharding in starter zones means every realm across the board turns into a ghost town three months later. How ironic that players circlejerk “the community aspect” while simultaneously promoting anti-community solutions, like permanent server merges, or hours-long queues. 
---
Myopic numbskulls, if you ask me. Not you, though. I'd never say anything bad about you.
---
Personally, I'll take sharding for the first hour at launch instead of community-destroying bullshit, like mergers and queues. Although if you *really* want fewer realms with larger caps, then I'd love the dynamic spawn system you'd be forced to implement!
---
So in that sense, I actually agree with you! Bring on the new spawn rates!
---
I love fishing. Mostly because I fished at night and everything seemed really calm.
---
Good way to filter out noobs who wear full t2. 
---
I never saw anybody craft for vendor gold, (Except when they did it to skill up as well, which is of course perfectly fine) Only reason to do it is to disenchant the stuff, some items have good EV on disenchanting, and you can endlessly put up enchanting mats on the AH, without risking AH fees when it doesn't sell. 
---
I miss pre bc WoW... 
---
How do you even come up with that nonsense.
---
^ Beautifully put.
---
Part of what makes mage so strong is how good the 1.12 talents are. And it's a strength that persists at lower gear levels.
---
Because you’ve never played vanilla. Vanilla was an unbalanced shitshow. TBC wasn’t perfect but it was infinitely more balanced than vanilla. 
---
I worked overnights and the fishing tourny when it released was at 7am on a Sunday, I was first or second ally side to win it after the horde camped it for like a month! It wasn't peaceful at all but it was worth it!
---
&gt; we are all in our mid/late 20s now,
---
haha, you are funny.   you can easily add 10 years to that :D
---
You fail to see my point? 
---
Did you miss the massive popularity spike after it was released on mobile? You can claim it was successful before, but fact is that it wasnt nearly as popular since after.
---
what
---
OP is the kinda' person who claims they played Vanilla and wants everything exactly how it was, but actually didn't play it, and will ruin it for everyone else. 
---
They will basically poll anything that gains traction in the community. Generally through reddit. 
---
I don't think 90% of #nochanges friends (like me) are against changes once the game is stable.
---
no way the game keeps a real playerbase through naxx, so of course we'll need "new content" in the same way OSRS gets new content. but that "new content" in OSRS isn't just QoL features ripped from retail, it's the equivalent of adding post-Naxx raids/world events.
---
When people talk about "changes" right now, they're 99% talking about QoL shit from retail and small adjustments that change gameplay integrity. It's an entirely different discussion and to group to two just to shit on a vocal minority you don't like is pretty nonconstructive.
---
Some of my old gaming buddies still play retail, although usually just out of habit, they buy the latest expansion, play 2-3 months and then go hibernate again.
---
I am sure most of them will jump back into classic, at least for a while.    I don't think we will go hardcore raiding again, life has caught up too much for most. 
---
It's never going to happen, unfortunately.  It's too big of a change, even though I believe the change is entirely positive.  Dual spec is one of the best things they added to the game, but the initial release is likely to be as "pristine" a version of vanilla as possible.  I'd like to see dual spec down the line if they ever start adding content to the game, but I still don't know that it will ever happen.
---
Dual spec is huge even when playing a pure dps class, which really just highlights how important it is for hybrids.  Most raid specs are pretty ass for pvp, so if you want to pvp between raid nights you're respecing multiple times a week.  I play on pvp servers because that shits fun, but I'll be forced to decide between taking raiding seriously, taking pvp seriously, or farming asstons of gold.  All of those choices negatively affect how much fun I'm having with the game, and that sucks.
---
You’re overestimating it. MC will be cleared before the 2nd server reset. BWL and AQ will be cleared within an hour of release. And Naxx within a couple of hours, 3-4 hours. I can guarantee you all of this and you will be there to see it in Classic. 
---
Hysterical. I can promise you that Classic will be infinitely easier than any private server out there. I wish I could see the look on your face when you hear that some ex private server guild cleared Classic BWL and AQ within an hour and Naxx within 3 hours. 
---
Agreed mate, would love to see this. All the no changers can go back to private servers imo
---
Rep gains are 100% accurate on private servers and easily verifiable. You are utterly clueless. 
---
That’s tbc 
---
Warlocks CAN use tier 1 for quite a while because they have no other way to get threat reduction. But its not a big deal, the extra damage isnt going to make or break a raids success. 
---
His gear looks badass too.
---
Gruul is cool.
---
educate myself on what?  
---
did you look at your own graph? the jump in late 2018?  
---
nice fail  
---
thank you all for the kind words, means a lot! also very cool to read so many people having the same strong feelings about these spooky mills :)
---
Only god wears cloth :) and wearing cloth as any other class which can wear better armor type, only makes you a better, more careful and more courageous player! Your positioning, maintaining low threat, everything will improve. You can play it to perfection and you won't be dying!  
---
And cloth looks beautiful, makes any character from any race look more beautiful to look at! Hey you are visually consuming your screen for hours and hours ;)  
---
&gt; Lol, says the want who wants sharding. A change that has a MUCH bigger impact than simply adjusting a few numbers. 
---
Sharding starter zones will impact maybe an hour, an hour and a half, *tops* of your total Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues? Not so much. Ironically, the *least* damaging, *least* anti-community of those solutions is cloning starter zones for the first hour of your leveling.
---
&gt; Your hypocrisy is astounding.
---
Hypocrisy? Oh. You must not know me. I'm the *only* person on this sub with the balls to argue (with [sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/anbwl1/i_hope_that_a_subscription_and_a_one_off_fee_is/efsg1bk/)) that the WoW Token *should* be implemented in Classic. For *moral* reasons:
---
* [Why it would be irresponsible to *not* implement a legitimate way to buy gold in Classic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/ecpoedz/)
---
The only person in this sub who has argued that maybe the devs should [fix known bugs that weren't caught until TBC](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak3qqw/should_all_bugs_be_fixed_even_if_they_were/)
---
So put some [*respeck*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_uurTJYYmc) on my name.
---
i was planning on playing as Fishmagician but granted i got the name from a superhero name generator
---
Are you daft or blind? Perhaps both?  OSRS has been growing since 2014, where it hit a low point because of #nochanges. It has been growing ever since. (Hint: OSRS is the blue line, I assume you're not colorblind right? Although you'd look less embarrassed if you were at this point.) F2P was only reintroduced in 2015, and mobile didn't come out until late last year. Ofcourse there was a spike, but it's not like it hadn't been growing before that. 
---
Do you actually think before you write?
---
Wasn't nearly? The population has hit 100k before mobile. And as of right now there is 105k people online.
---
&gt; Blizzard will never do this, because they are FAR too prideful.
---
I mean, I wouldn't want it to happen just because of how many myopic numbskulls are in this community already.
---
and then went on to raid AQ40 how nice :&gt;
---
It's the automated roll system (Need/Greed/Pass). I suppose there's a hidden secondary roll in there somewhere to determine the winner of what appears to be a tie.
---
&gt;YOU ONLY WANT YOUR NOSTALIGC FANTASY LOL
---
&gt;YOU DIDNT EVEN PLAY AT LAUNCH LOL
---
Can you even make a single sound argument or is your brain incapable of doing anything other than throwing meaningless buzzwords and insults around?
---
Ok well as soon as they create a time machine and I can travel back to 2004 I will show them this comment so that I can play properly.
---
Im not taking about 1.12 I'm talking about VERY early vanilla Bear form only had a 125% armor bonus at the time and there was absolutely no way to resonably tank until the druid buffs some time later, you also had very little overlap on talents for dps and tank stuff. By the time they buffed druids people had already resigned themselves to healing and built a healing set, or in my case rerolled to a dps class. 
---
The point of my post was talking about this very early period when, many of us wasted a huge amount of time trying to make completely unviable specs work.
---
Read the lore about “The Butcher” in this dungeon. Scary stuff.
---
Your art is so rad! It gives me those warm happy nostalgia feelings.
---
when you are so blind you are unable to follow your own graph  
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ke7wfvW.png  
---
that's embarrassing my dude  
---
Why do you think I recommend a SL Lock when OP said Random BGs with no gear?
---
If you want burst you need gear - no matter the class.
---
In randoms since everyone is bad if you just want to play with one hand or roll your face across the keyboard and win - pick an SL Lock.
---
If you want to roll in group PvP and RBG, have your gear - there's a lot more to choose from.
---
OP wasn't asking about geared, ranked or group, he was asking about easy mode vs noobs. That's the point. 
---
Druid T2 bonus is fun and really can generate a lot of value in the right circumstances.
---
SL is not -terrible- in BGs it just has a completely different role of playing defense.
---
Stick ONE good SL on a flag and that base is now covered. 
---
Like a boat anchor, even if you send enough to overwhelm him, you aren't capping that flag before help arrives.
---
They can't, the set has not enough +hit , spelldamage and crit and too much of nonsense stats that take up 'gear points'.   Well they could use it obviously, but they would be less effective than a warlock using better blue items from 5 man dungeons and non set epics.  (even if we consider a situation without the better catch up blues from later patches)  
---
I think so after a few months
---
&gt; small
---
&gt; dual spec
---
are you serious? do you even understand how much this a change is? it's like giving free hundreds if not thousands of gold to everyone
---
The wipes on the second pull!
---
It was just rumors before this, because of increasing rewards for voluntarily leaving the company. It's more expensive for Blizzard to forcefully get rid of employees so they just gradually upped the rewards leading up to the inevitable mass layoffs.
---
Im not sure how bad bears were way back then, but you could defo dps or offtank atleast. Ive always played with groups that accepted any class and we just tried to beat encounters with the characters we had, regardless of viability. Sure we never got any world firsts, but we had fun together and downed most content while it was current.
---
&gt; Another option would be adding only horizontal progression.
---
I feel like horizontal progression is the *only* viable option. They would have to be very careful when implementing gear that is better than Naxx.
---
Over the last couple of years, you have been given literal case studies that offer solutions that have been shown to work on a silver platter. Yet you choose to ignore them, vehemently defending stuff that has never been tried before instead. If that isn't the definition of willful ignorance, as per your own words, I don't know what is.
---
&gt; ... and the only person in this sub who can argue that the devs should fix known bugs that weren't caught until TBC.
---
By the way, dynamic respawn was a feature Blizzard introduced in TBC themselves. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Also, why involve all these irrelevant topics? Maybe try to argue your case on a single one at a time?
---
Technically thats runescape classic. A very different game. It became the runescape we all know in late 04
---
Lolk, thanks for confirming you're an actual moron. Bye.
---
Lol, thanks for confirming you're an actual moron. Bye.
---
The stock went 40% down cause tech sector went 40% down.
---
That's what I said. 
---
&gt; You’re overestimating it. MC will be cleared before the 2nd server reset.
---
That's not possible due to Dousing water, it's time gated for a few weeks.
---
&gt;BWL and AQ will be cleared within an hour of release.
---
You need sands for Chromaggus so definitely not an hour unless you have perfect execution and don't wipe more than 1-2 times.
---
It does it prevent, it creates a barrier that casual players do not like. If you want to respec daily you can you just need to pay the price, time is money friend
---
The 8/8 T2 set bonus for Mage is one of the most entertaining set bonuses, so mages are typically all to eager to complete it just for fucking around with in PvP. It's not ideal for PvE at all though, and even for PvP it's questionable. But damn if it ain't fun.
---
&gt; literal case studies that offer solutions that have been shown to work on a silver platter.
---
Like which ones?
---
&gt; dynamic respawn was a feature Blizzard introduced in TBC themselves. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Did you not understand what I said? I'm the only one in this sub who has the balls to argue that Blizzard should fix bugs that were known, but not fixed until TBC.
---
Were dynamic spawns a bug that was not fixed until TBC? Or were they a *design decision*? Talk about not understanding what you're talking about. (Hint: Dynamic Spawns were a purposeful *design decision* implemented in TBC, not a bug fix.)
---
&gt; Maybe try to argue your case on a single one at a time?
---
Sure, I can want changes, and at the same time call out myopics in this sub who want #nochanges while at the same time asking for increased pop caps.
---
I gave you some examples of the kinds of changes I've promoted. But back to sharding:
---
Sharding starter zones will impact maybe an hour—an hour and a half, *tops*—of your total Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues? Yikes. Ironically, the least damaging, least anti-community of those solutions is sharding starter zones for the **first** hour of leveling your **first** character.
---
I'm sure plenty of other people have done it, not just me. 
---
I love how simple image showing that you're wrong got you buttblasted  
---
stay mad wrongboi :\^\)  
---
Ok so you didn't refute anything I said.  
---
WoW was made and survived thanks to casual players.  
---
And there is nothing "hardcore" about having to farm for hour or two every time you want to respec. Its mindless grind.  
---
You realize that you can do something actually productive with the time you spend trolling other people on here right? 
---
No you imply it is impossible to rank and ove and that is simply wrong 
---
Can you try and make a coherent sentence?  
---
If you're posting from phone, turn off auto correct.  
---
If you're trying to say Im implying its "impossible to rank up", no. I never implied that.  
---
Well they changed they armour percent from 125 to 360 if that tells you anything about how laughably squishy they were. This was very much pre powershifting and mcp days feral was extremly low dps and not long after dmg meters came out every progression guild on the server made there druids switch to innervate spec. People didn't know about downranking very much etc priests were constantly Oom and your job was badically to cycle innervates on them. It was the shittiest of the shitty jobs
---
You want to respec every day then grind the gold. It’s that simple
---
Link to actual video: [https://youtu.be/iEWgs6YQR9A?list=FLFo9qs7-AGA6DhC7GTbKS5w](https://youtu.be/iEWgs6YQR9A?list=FLFo9qs7-AGA6DhC7GTbKS5w)
---
oh the classic and pathetic "you're just a troll" after you get buttblasted  
---
you can't get more pathetic than this  
---
or can you?  
---
stay wrong madboi :\^\)  
---
This is fantastic work !
---
Sure. Its a bad design. It's that simple.  
---
Same! Also brd and brs dungeons are very fun too.
---
No it’s actually good design it prevents players exceeding at both facets of the game at the same time 
---
&gt;Lol, like what?
---
Old school Runescape, Nostalrius, Elysium, ...
---
(Research is hard)
---
&gt;Sharding is an old server technology at this point. Do you even know the history of retail WoW?
---
See, that is what your problem is. You equate everything to retail wow. Vanilla is not retail. I know you want it to be, judging from your other "changes", but it's not. It has not been tried before in vanilla, and hopefully won't ever be tried. 
---
Anyways, I'd love to argue all day but I gotta go. Seems like you need some time for self reflection and/or research anyways. 
---
I also really wouldn't talk about features being "damaging" when you're literally promoting goldselling btw. Doesn't really come across well.
---
Old school Runescape, Various private servers that apparently can't be named here, ...
---
Hence the automated reporting system sadly
---
Except its not at the same time.  
---
You have to change talents in order to be the best possible in the other part of the game.   
---
Not letting players enjoy full game for some arbitrary reason (time burden, for more sub $) is just bad design.  
---
No more biobrakes, ha!
---
We need a constitution of what makes vanilla vanilla. Then follow these rules while adding stuff  
---
Good luck with your life.
---
OSRS also has changes soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
If your completely against having engineering then you may as well get tailor and one of the other 3 for gold.
---
Tailor for your robes of the arch msge.  Bv set bonus is ok for frost and great for fire but ull break the set shortly after going fire..
---
Herbalism will net you a lot more gold during your dmn and dme farming as well as get you the Ocasionally black lotus.
---
Alchemy is good for making your own pots but as for gold, unless your keen on doing mental math and playing the ah you won't profit much with it.
---
Enchanting is only really profitable if you get rare enchants and get tips for them. Large bills and greater eternal are good gold as well from disenchanting but getting illusion dust usually means are net loss over just vending an item.
---
My recomendation,  engineering and tailoring at the start, drop tailoring after you make robes of the arch mage and pick up herbalism.
---
&gt; Old school Runescape
---
I wouldn't trust any of the myopic twats in this community with a vote. Fuuuck that. 
---
&gt; Various private servers that apparently can't be named here
---
Oh, you mean private servers that implemented dynamic spawn-rates and altered game mechanics / pop caps? Watch out, the #nochanges crowd is gonna come eat you!
---
&gt; You equate everything to retail wow.
---
First you say the technology is *untested*, then you backpedal to saying: Weeeeell, it hasn't been tested *in vanilla.* Lol okay.
---
&gt; I also really wouldn't talk about features being "damaging" when you're literally promoting goldselling btw. Doesn't really come across well.
---
Actually it comes off much better than the status quo:
---
This entire community of sociopathic, neckbeards who believe that naive, handicapped, or younger players who seek gold from third-party companies deserve to get their identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied.
---
Aw this is super cool!
---
I didnt say it was a good set of gear. You might be able to get some hit on trinkets and other non set pieces but would probably still not be that great. But youll look good doing it lol.
---
&gt; Grouping up in WoW is detrimental to your leveling experience 
---
It's not all about having maximum efficiency. If a certain area is overcrowded, you simply invite a few of the people currently working on said quest and be done with the quest in 5 minutes. Quest xp rewards make up the bulk of your experience gains, most of the time.
---
&gt; The dirty secret of all private servers is that to ensure a smooth launch they all incorporate some form of dynamic spawns or artificially adjust the spawn rates of resource nodes and mobs to non-blizz-like levels, ha! 
---
Conveniently skipped over the part where I actually acknowledged this. Private servers had to do this simply because of their increased server caps.
---
&gt; Having the full capacity of concurrent players in only six starter zones was *not* how WoW was designed to be played normally. 
---
Completely took my comment: "how mmo's were meant to be played"; out of context. Just because it wasn't designed this way, doesn't make it any less true. They never envisioned the game taking off, the way it did. To me that was much of the charm of Vanilla. Seeing a zone completely full compared to seeing a handful of people. Yeah give me the former, even if it dips in to my experience rates.
---
&gt; This “fear” that sharding starter zones will lead to “shard-hopping” multiple Kazzak’s is almost willful ignorance and disinformation at this point. 
---
Again, with you quoting my pandora's box comment, you just seem to read what you want. Never mentioned anything about using sharding as an exploit mechanic. 
---
&gt; Misinformation. According to Mark Kern himself, pop caps at launch were 2.5k *concurrent* and were tweaked over the course of Vanilla to around 3.5-4k by patch 1.12.) 
---
I'll give you that one, even though I used a "?". However that doesn't mean anything. They tweaked the cap, but there weren't dynamic respawns or sharding back then, so that point is moot. Especially if you compare the maximum cap of 4k to private server caps which were about 3-4 times higher. 
---
&gt; Even the most cynical [investor analysts](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4237543-activision-blizzards-secret-weapon?amp_js_v=0.1) agree that: “... the success (or failure) of Classic will not single handedly transform the company in a radical way.” 
---
Maybe I should have used more emphasis on the word **"might" .** I know full well that Classic won't make or break the company as a whole. I also used the word redeem; as in redemption. There are also articles surfacing at the moment that mention: Activision-Blizzard's "secret weapon" to the current drop in stocks, is in all actuality WoW: Classic. So me saying that, wasn't a huge exaggeration.
---
&gt; Sharding is the solution for grown ups who understand the compromises that need to be made in order to ensure the health of the game *for the long run****.*** 
---
Sharding isn't a solution for the longevity of the game at all. Listening to your player-base, hand-in-hand with critical thinking will ensure it's longevity. Having non-biased Q&amp;A's where they don't just cherry pick the easy questions, will ensure that. Completely changing core mechanics will not however.
---
&gt; *Not* implementing sharding in starter zones means every realm across the board turns into a ghost town three months later. How dare players talk about “the community aspect of it” while simultaneously promoting permanent server merges or hours-long log-in queues. Myopic numbskulls, if you ask me. Not you, though. I'd never say anything bad about you. 
---
I've never said anything about permanent server merges. Having dead servers have always been a thing in MMO's, it just part of it. Look at retail WoW, it's practically the definition of a ghost town, but than on the larger scale than just having a few ghost servers. Sharding surely had a hand in creating the current state.
---
And your sarcastic comment isn't appreciated if you want to sway people in actually changing their minds. It's like going over to Steven Crowder, sitting down with him, but having absolute no interest in having your opinion changed.
---
&gt; Okay. Except my opinion is informed by history, articles, blue-posts, private server implementations, etc.—and your opinion just seems like textbook feels-over-reals. 
---
My opinion is based on playing MMO's since the launch of EQ and being part of multiple communities for 2 decades. Most people want Classic because of the community aspect and not have the instant gratification of efficiency.
---
Are there problems, with having overpopulated areas? Absolutely, but sharding isn't the solution you desperately want. Sharding would only be a band-aid to a short-term problem.
---
You can cite &amp; quote blue-posts all you want, the devs created the current situation with retail and have no clue on how to fix it. To be honest, I'm not even sure they can actually fix retail at this point or if it's even worth salvaging at this point.
---
Warlock T2 is pretty great since it reduces Threat and thats what bottlenecks Warlocks.
---
I think there's a balance.  If it's too broken it's unplayable or lends itself to horrible mismatches.  If it's too fixed then it's sterile and your choices are virtually meaningless.  I think TBC and WotLK struck the best balance.
---
There used to be 2 classes that could have duels lasting into infinity, Druids and Holy Pallies.
---
I grinded most of 56-60 in Scholo back when people would 10 man it, and I’m still not tired of it. Amazing atmosphere and theming, some legitimately difficult pulls, and loot to make most classes happy. Honestly probably the dungeon I’m most looking forward to running again.
---
Yeah I dont doubt they were bad and that they had little if no place in a progression guild, what im saying is that you could clear MC just fine with a few feral druid dps' without it being some huge burden.
---
(I mean you could 20 man MC easy)
---
Me too. My favourite dungeon.
---
This is why they will have loot trading, too much manpower to handle tickets for loot mistakes.
---
I think best case scenario is slow/stun the hunter in hopes that the boss resists feign death.
---
Oh yeah holy pallies in full t3 can't be killed in 1v1, only by mages and warlocks that also have tier 3. They have infinite mana and really high armor but they lack the mobility that druids have
---
If you had the key you had a spot. 
---
Can't wait for our first raid where our main tank gets spam reported by a different guild and we don't get to raid. 
---
Idk, that seems like a situation where I’d rather see what carnage he can produce with said boss.
---
No. I rather grab some popcorn and watch the chaos unfd.
---
This exactly.  +1
---
From Bloomberg:
---
*“The layoffs, which could number in the hundreds, are part of a restructuring aimed at centralizing functions and boosting profit, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the changes haven’t been announced. Activision employed 9,800 people at the end of 2017.“*
---
That sounds more like “we have three separate HR departments. We should have one. Fire two of them. We have three marketing departments. We should have one. Fire two of them.”
---
Based on other comments it’s possible they’ll cut some fat from the Hearthstone and Overwatch teams. 
---
But that doesn’t seem like a “let’s fire the devs on a new project” type of scenario. 
---
I never pretended it would be. People keep saying vanilla is the sun and pservers are pluto they are so far off. 
---
Reminds me of the old affliction talent tree background. Good job there OP! 
---
No.  Start screen recording and enjoy the pure chaos of a world boss in a main city.
---
That’s awesome. This guy seemed to think he was running a military unit. I was in the military and wasn’t very appreciative of being talked to like some scrub. I was like dude this isn’t the military you need to lighten up.
---
If they're smart, they will keep some Classic servers, have TBC progression servers and have Classic servers with new "appropriate" content.  It should be a no-brainer for them.  Wouldn't it be cheaper to re-tool old expansions and make new "appropriate" content? Compared to developing a whole new game or compared to a new retail expansion?
---
Maybe BGs and Arenas could be converted into an eSport?
---
I think you are looking back with todays knowledge at yesterdays problems, MC was HARD when it came out, mechanics weren't known people people didn't know to save up FR gear as they leveled, youtube didn't exist, addons were still fairly primitive, 8 debuff slots, bad itemization etc. It took 154 days for the first clear of MC, there was VERY little room for fat at that time, with todays knowledge, talents, gear etc yeah its pretty trivial but it wasn't then and you weren't bringing bad specs to your raid.
---
Druid/Shaman = Instant groups, amazing adaptability, fantastic solo/duo capability through 2 relatively beefy healers and most importantly: Ghost wolf and Travel form.
---
If you choose a warlock you will always be stuck running to a place your duo partner already is.
---
Layoffs don’t effect game developments? 
---
LOL WHAT?
---
Even before AQ people with the right gear would be just immortal in 1v1. The best thing was watching 2 similarly geared fat feral druids duke it out and it lasted for 40 minutes before one of them had to go to the bathroom.
---
&gt; Conveniently skipped over the part where I actually acknowledged this. Private servers had to do this simply because of their increased server caps.
---
Then we're in agreement! Bring on the dynamic spawns in Vanilla!
---
&gt; you quoting my pandora's box comment, you just seem to read what you want. Never mentioned anything about using sharding as an exploit mechanic.
---
You made it clear that sharding in starter zones could give the devs the confidence to shard *all* zones. In that case (pandora's box is opened, lol) we'll have a situation where a realm can have multiple Kazzaks, in different shards. Think about the implications of your statements for more than a second, maybe?
---
&gt; Sharding isn't a solution for the longevity of the game at all. Listening to your player-base, hand-in-hand with critical thinking will ensure it's longevity. Having non-biased Q&amp;A's where they don't just cherry pick the easy questions, will ensure that. Completely changing core mechanics will not however.
---
All non-sequiturs.
---
&gt; Having dead servers have always been a thing in MMO's, it just part of it.
---
Lol, I'm quoting you on that!
---
&gt; It's like going over to Steven Crowder, sitting down with him, but having absolute no interest in having your opinion changed.
---
Ahaha, the guy who chickened out of a debate with Sam Seder at Politicon so hard that even the organizers stated that “somebody got cold feet!” The same guy who fled from the [Potholer54 debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/6veu8u/steven_crowder_backs_out_of_potholer54_debate/) because he knew he'd get blown the fuck out? Yikes!
---
&gt; Most people want Classic because of the community aspect
---
Ah yes! The ironic defense of *community*. Sharding starter zones will impact maybe an hour—an hour and a half, *tops*—of your total Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues? Ironically, the least damaging, least anti-community of these solutions is sharding starter zones for the **first** hour of leveling your **first** character.
---
Oof, your arguments are terrible.
---
What editing software is this lmao
---
Sure, but are we not actually talking about how balanced Classic will be when it comes out in a few months? I dont think ignoring all the experience and knowledge we have today is gonna help anyone.
---
As far as im aware all classes have a role to play, even back then, but especially now. Todays knowledge is key, if we are strictly discussing this through a lens of 2004, then ill agree that bear tanks were few and far between.
---
Waaait
---
Your screen looks too wide for this to have been taken in 2006
---
Here we go again..
---
Didn’t specify where the t2 will be worn... nice try pal.
---
The basic argument is that if they dedicate enough server "space" (not use sharding initially) to acccommodate the initial rush, you will end up with dead servers 2 months later when all the tourists leave.  Blizzard hates merging servers, so don't expect that to be an option.
---
I am extremely suspicious of Blizzard as many are.  I would be fine with an initial cluster-fizzle in the first couple weeks, I did it on private server lauches.  Having said all that, I understand their argument for sharding.  If they are correct and it improves the long term health of servers AND if they don't shard anywhere else, they I think it is the right call.
---
Oh, the Q&amp;A?  I'll have to go back and watch.  Thank you.
---
I do completely agree with you removing the limit.  It really seems pointless and it can even by abused with oozling pet and such.  Not sure why this bug is good and that bug is bad.  The lines people draw is strange.
---
Thanks, unfortunately I’m EU but I appreciate the offer. But yeah I think PvP would be interesting as I imagine a lot of time is spent fighting. :)
---
Some people may be, but that wasn't the purpose of my post. I specifically said that the class descriptions were NOT indicative of the endgame gameplay at all, and pointed to that as an example of bad gameplay design, if you want to discuss the balance in the upcoming classic release then thats fine too but don't equate what I am saying as any part of that. 
---
Vanilla was an everchanging experience and to discount the problems does a disservice to its strengths, OP asked why people thought TBC was better and I answered with a potential reason. 
---
As awesome as that sounds, i don't think it would be vaible to split the community into three separate games. The most likely outcome if any, would probably be the tbc progression while allowing those who don't want to, to stay on classic. It will only be a small team most likely so distributio  of staff with be the deciding factor if we reach that stage. 
---
I love the social aspect of MMOs but from what I’ve played of Star Wars Galaxies and ESO people seem to just stick to the grinding and not take much time to interact. I heard WoW has become a bit like that these days, thats why I thought Classic might be a little more friendly haha
---
Really? Do you recommend Classic over the current build? I am excited to get started for sure.
---
4 hours Inc xD
---
If you miss seeing many people around you like that again, then speak out against sharding now.  
---
Once it proves useful in the starting areas, it follows that they will likely rely upon it for other crowded areas, like cities.  
---
Sharding will kill community and immersion - just like it has in modern WoW.
---
I won't fight you, but I will show you why you are wrong.
---
a MMORPG is about community.  Personal loot is a factor against that, it's about the individual.   i am not debating the fairness of a personal loot system, I am sure it can be great, more fair even than any other system, but we still don't want it.  It's not something or a game like vanilla WoW.  Loot in vanilla wow is by design part of the community building blocks.  You play with others and over time establish strong relations with others. Getting into a situation where you can truly trust each other on loot issues is priceless.   Sure , everybody gets burned sometimes by a ninja pugger or a guild officer going mad, but that's not the end of the world.  The risk of such things is what makes the ideal situation more valuable and worth working for together.  If we wanted to play a solo game, we would play a solo game. 
---
 
---
Not suiting your preference does not make it bad design 
---
QA is always in the first round.
---
Mage T3 is not really good, the set bonuses are strong but the gear itself is quite weak except for some pieces.
---
Let's hope it is HOTS dudes. 
---
Sorry HOTS dudes.
---
OMG I love it!! Awesome work
---
Yes, but what was specifically being discussed was AH purchases, not player-sent mail, which is what Ion's comment was referencing. Unless you have something else/resource explicitly stating purchases weren't instant
---
The fundamental problem with "X can't beat Y" is that it exists in a pure vacuum divorced from context (like gear, consumables, trades, etc) and player skill. In your video you are dueling a rogue. Druid's absolutely destroy rogues in general, but plenty of rogues can beat druids if played correctly. 
---
Please do continue to create more content if you want, but a few duels aren't going to change anyone's mind about anything, particularly without any kind of input in the video. If you have some duels where you lay out what you are thinking, what you are afraid of, how you're going to predict your opponents next move, why you used this consumable at this time, that would go a lot further in meeting the goal you laid out in the OP.
---
What dragon?
---
i recall more than once everyone getting to the door only to find out no one had the key.
---
If you keep on worrying about everything that comes up with Activision and that it will affect classic then you are setting for sleepless nights.
---
At this point the only thing we can do is put our face in delight and wait. Once summer comes everything will be clear.
---
Gnome or undead were always the most infuriating rogues.
---
especially when an undead cannibalizes you afterwards. 
---
Well, I keep up a lot with AI development. I have no idea what the cost would be but i know this is something an AI would specialize in efficiently watching for and understanding
---
What's wrong with that?
---
aah i see
---
Fantastic and tough dungeon
---
I mean that it was booted back to exactly how it was in 2007
---
Dad u are so young
---
I totally agree. I've put forward my thoughts regarding sharding on the forums multiple times. Blizzard don't really seem to understand their consumers lately and I'm not confident they'll listen. But who knows. Hopefully they'll just use it for starting areas. I'd rather they just increased spawn rates of quest mobs and drop chances on quest items for the first few weeks tbh. At least that way, people are all together from the start. I get that it may be a strain on the servers but if they have multiple servers like they used to I don't see it being a problem. They could always merge lower pop servers or provide free transfers. 
---
There are so many solutions to the problems they're facing and they always seem to take the least popular one. 
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
&gt;  trimming the fat       
---
Good companies don't keep much dead weight on staff.  The 'dead weight' they are carrying is usually protected from on high.  
---
&gt; not directly related to cash income       
---
The positions indirectly related to cash income like QA/infrastructure support are the most likely to go in a situation like this.  Problem is, they were all there for a reason.  You lose customer satisfaction and engagement when you start shipping a dodgy product. 
---
The community is split into like 35 different private servers now and its doing enough to keep a decent player base on them, I don't think that a few splits is gonna kill them
---
Holy Paladin would definitely use full T3 from Naxx, it was absolutely perfectly statted for them (pure Int, MP5, spell crit) and had some really great set bonuses.
---
Of course T1-T2 for paladins was basically more for soloing/small group stuff/tanking. Up until Naxx good Holydins would be in offset healer plate (like legplates of blazing light) comboed with cloth/leather/mail healer offset parts with as little spirit as possible. 
---
Daybreak has Everquest servers still running, including a buch of progression servers.  Straight progression.  Time-locked progression at a particular expansion.  Player voted progression servers (players vote when to get the next expansion).  If WoW did this they could have TBC progression, Classic that stays Classic and Classic that evolves a la OSRS. 
---
Now when you play the Vanilla EQ you still have all QOL and UI changes that the most current expansion has, so it is not a direct comparison.  What it has shown is that there is a market for progression servers on old games.
---
PALADIN HOLY RAIDS: tier sets are garbage until you get tier 3, tier 3 being the only set good for PvE Healing.
---
PALADIN HOLY PVP: Use tier 1, followed by tier 2, followed by tier 3. (tier 2 is good for everything, with shockadin being really good with this tier set.)
---
PALADIN RET RAIDS: Don't play ret in raids.
---
PALADIN RET PVP: Don't bother playing ret in PvP until you have tier 2, then it is pretty good. Full tier 2.5 set is in my opinion BiS for ret in PvP. Some people suggest you should go shoulder/legs off-pieces from naxx and then finish it with rank 13 helm/gloves/boots, I have done the math and Im pretty sure full 2.5 is better.
---
Exactly, we are talking 6 vs 15 spirit here.
---
I would leave him alone. Some Elves just want to watch ~~the world~~ Orgrimmar burn.
---
But hey they censored Jaina's boobs in hearthstone so all is well.  Get Woke Go Broke.
---
I'm really hoping for an Anarchy Online 2 though, the game was brilliant and it is still running, but it has aged so poorly it's hard to look at now.
---
OSRS has made changes to the original game, and added new content.
---
It is all you had on the private server to be fair.  The problem with private servers is that after the initial surge, there was nothing but downhill from a population perspective.  Guild's cannibalizing other guilds so they can field 40 people is depressing after you go through it a couple times.  The hype and excitement of a new server sounds appealing when you are in that situation.
---
This is why so many people wanted Blizzard's Classic WoW servers.  The belief that new people will continue to join your server and it is not a slow depressing decline that has me crying in my pillow every night.  Sorry, little carried away there.
---
You could roll a different character that’s better than a warrior at acquiring gold, to keep up with respec costs. Might be a good idea as a prot warrior regardless, since your upkeep is quite high with repair costs and consumables etc.
---
In retail vanilla I played a prot warrior, and it was brutal trying farm solo. I felt like a boat anchor with no boat. This time I’ll roll a hunter alongside my warrior to feed his professions and gold needs.
---
my new wallpaper, thank you so much for sharing this masterpiece with us :))
---
Well, if the storyline was really involving sure maybe it would be passable. But the world was quite patched together in large squares, then theres just a casual terrorist bombing in the middle of it. I donno I just feel like this whole storytelling trend that started BC and beyond kinda added to the fact that pretty much all good memories exist in vanilla. Im genuinely curious if a new director took over half way through BC
---
There's no way kiting world bosses will be in classic
---
I too prefer the the vanilla storytelling but your posts makes it sound like there is something inherently wrong with having a quest that has a suicide bomber.
---
Personally I think the thing that makes it less intruiging than vanilla is the same issue that the later expansion suffers from in story telling aswell. It feels more like it is designed to be played as a game and less designed purely as a fantasy world
---
thank you for your comment. I kind of agree with druids beating rogues but in these duels the rogues have all their cooldowns + preparation up and that is never easy to beat for any class. 2 blinds, 2 sprints and 2 vanishes is really tough to play against. And about me not having any kind of input with tactics etc. in the video, i'll take that into consideration in the future, thanks.
---
If that’s how they end up doing it then I most likely won’t play. Anything they do to shrink the community will kill it for me. 
---
They’re going to tank it on purpose then when everyone quits they’ll say “see, we knew you wouldn’t like it”. 
---
Yah your right. It feels hard to really differentiate the two. You put it way better, I guess the two things combined makes it feel way worse
---
Dreamstalker. 
---
&gt; I can't believe I have to repeat myself again, but: **Most quest mobs / items aren't shared.** This means grouping up does nothing change your leveling experience except lower your XP-per-kill. 
---
I'll have to repeat something from my original comment then aswell.  "Some gather quests might be a hassle, but people rarely complete an **entire** zone before moving to another." People just don't stand around waiting for a quest mob, with their dicks flapping in the wind. If a spot is too crowded, they either move on, group up for the "X" kill quests &amp; skip the gather quests.
---
Having more people in your group doesn't affect your xp rates that much or at all. Doing quests with more people, significantly increases your kill speeds. Kill "X" quests were shared, gather quests weren't. 
---
&gt; You made it clear that sharding in starter zones could give the devs the confidence to shard *all* zones, a.k.a. “opening Pandora's box.” In that case we'll have a situation where a realm can have multiple Kazzaks, in different shards. No clue why you're dodging your own implications. 
---
Never made such a statement at all. Maybe I should have used the analogy: "Opening a can of worms". If we would allow sharding to be implemented, it isn't that farfetched that Blizzard would think, we'd be ok with **other** smaller changes.
---
&gt; Non-sequiturs. And sharding the first hour of your first character is hardly *changing core mechanics.* 
---
How is it a non-sequitar, if I said some things that would actually help with the longevity of the game compared to sharding. If sharding would only affect the first hour of gameplay, how the hell is it supposed to help with the longevity of the game? Doesn't make sense at all. "After 3 months the servers would be ghost towns", how would sharding in the initial zones combat that at all?
---
&gt; Ahaha, the guy who chickened out of a debate with Sam Seder at Politicon so hard that even the organizers stated that “somebody got cold feet!” The same guy who fled from the [Potholer54 debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/6veu8u/steven_crowder_backs_out_of_potholer54_debate/) because he knew he'd get blown the fuck out? Fuck me. I didn't realize people were unironic fans of his. 
---
It was just meant to point out how ridiculous you sound with that sarcastic comment you made. You have clearly no intention of having an open-mind. On a side-note, I don't like or dislike Crowder, it was merely an example.
---
&gt; Ah yes! The *community aspect*. Sharding starter zones will impact maybe an hour—an hour and a half, *tops*—of your total Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues? Ironically, the least damaging, least anti-community of these solutions is sharding starter zones for the **first** hour of leveling your **first** character. 
---
I'll have to ask again, how would sharding improve the longevity of the game if it only affects your first hour of gameplay on your first character?
---
Even though I never mentioned anything about permanent server merges. You keep bringing that up. Constantly reading into things out of context.
---
&gt; Oof, your arguments are terrible. 
---
Well if you're only going to nitpick certain points I make, taking them out of context &amp; skip half of the points I make, I can understand that.
---
If you don’t think it’s real go to this website and start putting some of those players names in from the photo. http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/
---
Yeah... no. People really blow up the messing up on loot-rate. I raided for three years and we only fucked up once, and that was for the helm of wrath for a back-up tank. Loot trading is an answer to a problem 99% of people didn’t know about yet has to possibility to allow griefing delux. What are they gonna make it so that Plate wearers can’t need on anything other than Plate, like it is on Retail? Then you’ve ruined the game.
---
Then the real fun begins and you have to get creative, wait, or die near the door.
---
Once. Doing a full quest run is epic as hell. Running around the big place figuring out where to go, usually in good company of friends and guildies. The magic wears off though and after running the Ironfoe run for 50 times it gets pretty lame. I do look forward to the epic quest run on Classic though. 
---
It's not 100% accurate, as it shows my BC toon in my raiding guild, then guildless, then back on that raiding guild in a span of 5 months. That's not true because it was the top guild on the server and I definitely didn't go guildless for several months
---
Also, my Vanilla guild roster didn't show the GM (who was the only name I could remember before looking this up), but I searched his name individually and sure enough it shows he was in that guild
---
Thrall is more of a peacechief, really.
---
Probably the most undervalued key to get in vanilla as almost every group contain a warlock/mage/priest/warrior who can duel and fear someone through the door. Warlocks can even life tap down, suicide with Hellfire and walk back as ghost to ress on the other side of the door. 
---
I'll never forget the amount of times I ran this dungeon, trying to farm for my shadowcraft hood. Good times and some bad times haha
---
Cool, then fuck it lets have a fucing police state with thought policing then, since its all meaningless.
---
I have no idea how or why you lost one specific character... But I had lost my account and eventually Blizzard asked me to send a copy of my ID to retrieve it. But that was around 2009 so their prices is probably different now
---
I love playing whack a mole
---
mail armor, healing etc etc, all the reasons why a hybrid class can never have the same top damage as a pure damage class.   I am sure  you know this, but I posted it for other readers who may wonder why a shaman bolt is weaker than a shadowbolt
---
They absolutely are. I wish there was more of them.
---
No. A shitfest in a capital city is much more entertaining than ruining a single player's day.
---
First of all, T1 and T2 were updated several times in vanilla so the stats may change depending on whether they implement gear updates like modern private servers do. 
---
For most classes T1 is pretty bad. Warriors can use it for tanking and some pieces are good for rogues. The full set for hunters is really strong I believe but they do so little damage anyways that it doesn't matter much.
---
T2 is significantly better itemised so most classes can use bits and pieces of it. Priests get a super 8-set bonus that makes the set almost on par with T3. The 3-set bonus is also extremely strong and should be maintained throughout vanilla. Warrior tanks have a very strong set as well but the rest use off-set in many slots. 
---
T2.5 is very strong for warlocks, mages, rogues and shadowpriests. Warlocks ideally should use the Bloodvine set but they are really close. 
---
T3 is very strong for all classes but few will use the entire shebang. Warriors probably will for tanking and I think paladin/druid/priest can use it for healing. Warlocks use 4 or 6 and the same with mages. Rogues I think use most of it as well.
---
I kinda hope they do because it's their last hope for bringing in a decent revenue stream and saving wow. It means blizz will die like they deserve for their recent behaviour and I can go back to my private server where it's being done right :D
---
Great leveling, great utility, great damage.  Multiple viable builds, warlocks are needed and good from level 1 to the end of vanilla.  Enchanting/Tailoring that helps you get BiS pre raid stuff.  Herb/Alch is probably second best imo.  Personally I'm stuck between Priest and Lock, but Enchanting/Tailoring to start then engineering at some point
---
Plate wearers can roll need on stuff in game?
---
I think you mix up the 8-set bonuses of T1 and T2. T1 reduces the mana cost of shadow spells by 15% (just like T2.5) and T2 reduces the threat of your destro spells by 20%. 
---
Okay? Did not fight enemies of Azeroth in his name? 
---
That's the retail model 
---
If someone wants to see the dumb shit I Google or the useless junk I buy on Amazon, so be it. It isn't that serious.
---
Thought ironfoe dropped in brd
---
I don’t know that just announcing it at blizzcon on was the problem but more that it was the only Diablo announcement at blizzcon.
---
I know. Got the pic from a machinima based off Warcraft 3, just thought he looked cool. 
---
My realistic goal for gear is the tier 0.5 sets so I'm looking forward to running this a bunch for the first time. You could zip zoom right by dungeons like these in wotlk.
---
Problem is that by using the bad pieces of T2 like legs, chest, bracers, boots etc you are gimping your damage so much that you don't even need the threat reduction. I really think the 3-set should have the reduction just like on the mage T2 set.
---
Agreed definitely my favorite horde starting zones. Minus UC, never like that city.
---
That’s what worries me about classic. I play osrs now and the game is amazing with updates. Still feels old school while adding new content.
---
If blizzard can just copy osrs and come up with new ideas or change the lore in any direction they want after original vanilla wow the game can really be amazing. As long as it stays to vanilla wow playstyle.
---
My faith is blizzard is at an all time low though so I’m not getting my hopes up.
---
You got me there!
---
I was mathing this out too, and I think tailoring for Mooncloth cooldowns is the way to go.
---
Let's make one thing clear. When people talk about scaling issues IT ONLY MEANS RAIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Not pvp.
---
Not leveling.
---
Not dungeons.
---
Maybe, and I mean MAYBE scaling is an issue in Nazz gear even outside of Raid buffing but that's near the end of a server life cycle.
---
Classes, for the most part , are not balanced 1v1 because Classic isn't balanced for Raiding and Arena like later Wow. There are meant to be differences and function between specs and classes.
---
Druid is a hybrid and therefore has a variety of tools which makes them amazing 1v1. BUT, you need the proper gear or some specs aren't viable early in pvp. People will see vids of Druids killing any class 1v1. This can occur. It doesn't always happen because most Druid players can't commit to the Druid endgame which is typically building multiple sets while starting as healer in raids. 
---
Druid is also considered a high skill class (and I only mean this in relation to itself ... say comparing the class to Paladin game play) so not all players will master the game play style. Some people just like to keep things simple. Druid is not simple unless you only play one spec forever.
---
Agreed, completely.  Honestly, the whole northern part of the Eastern Kingdoms is fantastic. Hillsbrad, Hinterlands, etc.
---
This was their response "I'm afraid that priest has gone through too many transfers between domestic (normal players) accounts, and is not a character that is recoverable. Since those transfers required the account's login information and were not done by foreign exploitive parties (gold sellers) we do consider them to be legitimate and will not be reversing them." 
---
Not sure what happened. Tried telling them the account must of been compromised but they said its not reversible. /shrug
---
Not true 
---
dead meme
---
There are three to choose from: 
---
Alchemy can transmute arcanite and also a few other things like essence of undeath to essence of water and heart of fire to 3 elemental fire, although that requires revered(?) with Thorium Brotherhood.
---
Tailoring can make Mooncloth.
---
Leatherworking can make Cured Rugged Hide.
---
I would say definitely go alchemy because it's a very versatile profession. Often you earn more from transmuting undeath into water than arcanite. You can also change depending on what the market says.    
---
When it comes to tailor or leatherworking it's hard. Currently on private servers it seems like LW earns more money but that could change. There definitely seems to be many more tailors than leatherworkers too, but again it's on private servers.
---
Cant wait for classic, period. Everything you see and do in the world has feel to it. Dungeons feel atmospheric and dangerous, mobs seem powerful and the leveling process feels like a journey that its mean to be. I genuinely suggest people to treat the leveling process as a adventure instead of keeping eyes on the xp bar non stop, unless ofc your only motivation to play is to hit 60 asap and get bis gear. 
---
Hi, /u/randomcollegeman1997
---
&gt;Agamand Mills
---
I'd say my favourite zone would be Westfall.  The music alone just drew me in so much to the storyline, there.
---
1st step for ANY company when trimming the fat:
---
1. LAYOFF HR!!!! 
---
HR is where the political ideology enters companies.
---
Sell high value gray items to vendors, like farming high level bats, bears, spiders, and griffins. Also, gray weapons from Humanoids vendor for a fuck ton.
---
I didn't buy Bfa, too many changes, too many changes I didn't think I would like and having read the opinions of the likes of Preach etc it's not a good expansion to get into wow. Classic however is a beast of an mmorpg and everyone should try it.
---
They said it *will* be based on 1.12 - That doesn't mean they can't gate content lol.
---
Running this on my warlock to get my Dreadmist drop off of Jandice Barov, when no one wanted to do that boss. That was always a pain.
---
But I eventually walked away with the Headmaster's Charge. My AQ20 group wouldn't let me use any other weapon. The +20 Int raid buff was too much to give up.
---
My favorite dungeon! Always loved the spooky and mysterious parts of the vanilla game the most. Duskwood was my favorite zone, though Tirisfal Glades was nice too. Exploring around Karazhan and wondering what it was going to be was fun as well. I remember using an MPQ editor to add the unfinished model of Karazhan to Elwynn forest and running around inside it on one of the first emulators. (wowemu?)
---
Got the Beaststalker Cap off my very first run of this place. That's reason enough for me to love it.
---
T3 Rogue and warlock is busted, its so good.
---
I love Vanilla undead stuff. Instead of frankenstein's lab of mad scientists, it's abandoned former human areas that are haunted/cursed/torn apart. Was much more mood churning and eerie. 
---
&gt; a MMORPG is about community. Personal loot is a factor against that, it's about the individual.
---
No it's not. You can trade gear. You just aren't forced into it. 
---
Its not that I haven’t seen this video I just I misunderstood the information, that’s it. I tend to have to being doing a couple things at once constantly to keep my sanity, details tend to get missed. Pretty simple.
---
assblasted :)  
---
I'm still trying to figure out why they advertised the location for all to see. Did they really think this wouldn't happen?
---
China, UK, SWE, GER, FR already are to varying degrees.  
---
Of course all the hardcore muslim countries are automatically included.  
---
&gt;Why would you intentionally handicap yourself by not choosing a powerful racial?
---
It's about not relying on luck. 
---
Hi, /u/69mrsteal69yogirl69
---
There is zero negatives with having more frequent respecs available.  
---
While there is plenty with having it cost a lot.  
---
So its not really a preference.  
---
You're not making any sense, neanderthal.
---
&gt; I'll have to repeat something from my original comment then aswell. "Some gather quests might be a hassle, but people rarely complete an entire zone before moving to another." People just don't stand around waiting for a quest mob, with their dicks flapping in the wind. If a spot is too crowded, they either move on, group up for the "X" kill quests &amp; skip the gather quests.
---
So... you're admitting that people will leave the sharded starting zones early, thus minimizing the experience of sharding even further?
---
Damn. This is a really great argument in my favor. I'm stealing this for sure, thank!
---
Yes there is. It changes the class population diversity as well as increasing economic inflation 
---
It's about winning, who gives a crap how you do it as long as you come out on top. Use every advantage, if you don't you're a scrub.
---
There's a /s missing in your post
---
I loved the mills. The atmosphere, heavy mist, music. I can experience it all with your painting. Perfect.
---
No, even if there was it would ruin the point of sarcasm.
---
Diablo Immortal isn't as big of a fail as WotLK onwards, Diablo 3, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, etc.
---
You'll also need to consider time cost of doing so.
---
How long will it take to level that hunter to 35. At a fair / moderate pace, 40 - 50 hours. If your warrior main can farm 25 gold an hour, leveling the alt will cost you 1,000 - 1,250 gold.
---
Leveling that alt to 300 will be, let's say 200 gold in mats. more, less, should be in that range.
---
Average 1,325 gold to level this alt and give it alchemy.
---
Selling your transmute at a 10g per day premium.
---
This alt will start making money on day 133. If you don't log in 2 days a week cause even tryhards take days off, day 186.
---
So on day 186, this alt, having spent 10 minutes logging on, transmuting, 5 days a week will start making 10 gold a day.
---
In those 186 days, had your main spent 1 day in 6 grinding for an hour (same 10 minutes a day, just broken up for an hour of continuous) your warrior could do 31 hours of gold farming. for another 775 gold.
---
So what's important? 2100 gold or 10 gold a day after 6 months? And the warrior can sustain 4 gold a day with the same 10 min a day commitment by farming an hour a week.
---
&gt;It changes the class population diversity 
---
Provide proof. Total bs.  
---
&gt;as well as increasing economic inflation  
---
50g is used to prevent people from respecing and to make them grind for extra hours, not for removing gold.  
---
2 points and both are total crap. WP  
---
You're delusional. Danish kiss.
---
Gorgeous! You should post in on r/wow too, they could use some cheering up.
---
In retail WoW you’re not allowed to roll on gear you’re not supposed to wear. That works in Retail, but not in Vanilla. Warriors run around in Leather, Cloth is the best healing/caster gear there is and itemization is just plain and simple wild west. If Blizz were to restrict your need-button to armor-specific gear that would ruin the game. Players decide what’s good for them, not Blizzard.
---
Stop reposting.
---
&gt;To access this theme, first go to Wowhead's Classic site, classic.wowhead.com, and make sure you're logged in! 
---
No thanks, Wowhead should piss off because nobody likes them. They don't give a fuck about WoW they're just losers desperate for clicks
---
If you say so scrub, enjoy the corpse runs from people not handicapping themselves.
---
Agreed. It's the only reason I'd ever consider rolling a horde toon in classic. 
---
Look private realms have tried dual spec and reduced respec costs. The information is there if you care to do the research. Games without gold sink have inflation, it’s simple logic. As it stands almost every class can grind 50g an hour so could respec daily if they wanted to. 
---
Yeah we did, but Thrall himself was a bad warchief if you ask me.
---
No. In order to be good for eSport with few vs few battles, vanilla combat have to be chanced considerably. Remove most RNG elements, normalise classes, reduce burst DPS, even chance itemization. You can't make an eSport from an RPG. Retail WoW is compatible, vanilla is not.
---
See my reply above.
---
I agree with bad design. Time consuming without actual progress. If i would have to farm couple of hours to enjoy pvp few times a week, its not worth it for me. 
---
I don't fight lootbox gamers sorry bud I know you were hoping to make a big name for yourself by "winning" against a good player by relying on lootboxes. I just run and they can't keep up because they're fat neanderthals.
---
Yes, Kronos did reduced respec cost and it changed nothing.  
---
That's why Im asking you for proof, which you dont have. You are just making shit up.  
---
&gt;As it stands almost every class can grind 50g an hour so could respec daily if they wanted to.  
---
Your point? Game timegating you from playing the other part of the game to full potential is just there to increase time wasted, aka sub money.  
---
We are not talking about the pvp ranking system we are talking about duel spec. Two separate topics
---
It's not inconceivable, there were several 16:10 monitors back then. I got mine around Christmas 2006, I still have it actually. Hardware back then was built to last, well at least last longer than today.
---
"Loadout" wrong game bud
---
Yes, Kr0nos did reduced respec cost and it changed nothing.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GgflscOmW8
---
Depends whether it's an Orc or not.
---
yeah? and I bet his dps was garbage tier and also the guild leaders friend. i can also bet that he had to chug hundreds of gold worth of flasks just to keep up every raid night.
---
Yeah no worries. It was interesting watching your duel because, as a Druid, I could see the thought process behind what you were doing and I had a good read on the duel. The rogue was blowing his load and had you down to half health, but once you hit the rocket helmet, the duel was over. Walking through that process though where you say "this guy has used all of his good cool downs, i've got him FF'd and i'm healing back up to full, what the fuck could he possibly do to win now?" would be great for non players.
---
Even considering what you have above with cool downs and prep and poison would be neat. As a druid, you can pre-roll poison cleansing on yourself to cure poisons, or how Faerie Fire prevents rogues from vanishing would be neat.
---
In any event, it's your content so I hope you feel inspired to make more, whatever way it may turn out!
---
What a load of shit.
---
You can respec and many people switched back and forth every other day.
---
It has nothing to do with roles.
---
Get rid of the fucking private server footage you complete neanderthal. This is a WoW Classic subreddit where only things relevant to Classic should be posted.
---
&gt;Welcome to r/classicwow. This is a subreddit for the discussion of anything related to Classic World of Warcraft. More specifically, the new Classic servers that Blizzard has announced to launch.
---
Your post isn't relevant. Cya.
---
Im talking about the re spec / dual spec. Respeccing every week because of raids and bgs. And having to grind hours a week to be able to do that is bad design imo. I understand grinding for min maxing in raids is neccesary but grinding to enjoy both pve/pvp is cruel.
---
The one factor that isn't able to be math'd out in this is enjoyment. For sure it's a long term investment and for players looking to be on regularly for 2+ years, no doubt some CD alt income is good. But even for more casual players, grinding on a warrior can be really unappealing (or grinding on any class for that matter) so leveling an alt and doing professions doesn't feel as bad.
---
Agree with your math though, it checks out. I'll probably only do an alt for professions so I can keep engineering / mining on my main.
---
You're not gonna get anywhere when 90% of the people here never played Vanilla and only played private servers. They seem to think they know what Vanilla was like.
---
Remember it's "No Changes" unless you are talking about PvP then everything can be changed to appease the PvPers.
---
You could probably sell the name truck for like 100 bucks
---
Better than stupid Garrosh.
---
What are you smoking? It's not an argument in your favour at all. Merely pointing out that there are multiple solutions, **without** sharding.
---
If anything, you just devalued your own argument for sharding in acknowledging the already existing solutions to the overpopulation.
---
You can't even be bothered to debate anything I brought to the table. So in your own words. You're the myopic numbskull here.
---
Better prepare your little broken soul for gold farming then.
---
Let's get rid of the main gold sink in the game. Wee. Maybe you want consumables to not be consumed as well and just put on a CD instead to save gold?
---
I've seen and used scaling / gear dependency outside of raids... Played classic in 07... But that's how you use it and the majority of players, then sure.
---
But we can absolutely say that combat rogues, elem shamans, and warriors in general are much more gear dependent. That goes for pve and pvp. 
---
With reduced respec costs it caused market inflation as well as increasing world pvp ganging. I played on both k1 and k2 and the difference was obvious to me and plenty of others after the changes were introduced 
---
I don’t think so, Blizzard fucked him up in MoP but he was a true warchief before he turned evil. He’s one of Blizzards most developed characters.
---
Yeah I guess. The real problem is that Blizzard designed hybrid classes with that in mind, this idea that because you can do lots of things you don't do one thing super well, and inevitably the design of the game made that untenable. 
---
The game rewards you for having the best tank, best healer, and best dpser. While a hybrid class sounds like a terrific idea in theory, it never truly worked in practice. That's why I love the way BC is set up in class balance and design. The actual idea of a hybrid class is really abandoned but an elemental shaman, for example, brings lots of utility and okayish damage to be viable. 
---
It's just a shame that this design philosophy wasn't a part of vanilla, or at least they held all these ideas out of vanilla to drop it all as features of BC.
---
I ran it like 1000 times to get that cap. But finishing that set felt amazing. And then there was the D2 quest chain. Awesome.
---
I very much enjoyed these, thanks for sharing!
---
The cost does not stop you doing it, it makes it difficult.  
---
You should be asking for the pvp ranking system to be fixed not the introduction of dual spec
---
Runescape is sandbox mmo so it can be updated, where as WoW is more of a directional (yet somewhat still open ended) mmo. You can’t really just add new content to it like you can with osrs - that is until after Naxx and all content is completed. At that time I could see it being appropriate to add content that keeps the “vanilla wow” spirit. 
---
And the whole loot trading nonsense.
---
Seems like they were forced to have these systems in place to plan for not having barely any GM support.
---
Awesome. One of my fav leveling areas.
---
I'll be maintaining 2 accounts, so I'll have a level 1 bank alt scanning the ah on monitor 2 100% of the time while I'm playing my main.
---
Someone posts a stack of arcane crystals for 1g apiece? BAM, those are mine now.
---
I always found Thrall badass and awesome untill he went full Go'el...
---
Yeah, mine shows guildless a couple of times too even though I've always been in the same guild.
---
&gt; Raserisk has amazing videos covering raid tactics for AQ and the last bosses of Naxx.
---
Private server player
---
&gt; Kargoz if you want well explained in-depth guides.
---
Yeah especially the ones that tell you to use private server exclusive bugs to level faster in Classic. OMEGALUL
---
It took him like a year+ to realize that Right Click Report doesn't belong in Classic.. Most people with a brain have been reluctant to play Classic because of it since it was announced just going off the state of games like Overwatch and Retail WoW where it's heavily abused.
---
I just did these quests the other night on a private server. Been messing around to scratch that itch until classic comes out 
---
That plaguelands place was reachable by simply swimming along the northeastern coast of Tirisfal
---
After that picture I think we wallwalked onto the area above Strathome.
---
&gt; Merely pointing out that there are multiple solutions, without sharding
---
Oh, yeah, that's not a solution to having the entire concurrent pop cap of a realm in the same start zones at all!
---
But it's a great argument for how any effects of sharding can be further minimized.
---
&gt; So in your own words. You're the myopic numbskull here.
---
Yeah, not a good look to be insulting other posters. It's against the sub's rules and will get you suspended. Also, I never called you that.  Please stop being disingenuous. 
---
No kidding, old Scholomance was way more atmospheric than the haunted house it was turned into after Cata.
---
I had forgotten about Hordies hanging out in the Tram!  I reallyyyy hope Blizzard wouldn’t take reports of this serious...  I feel things of this nature were a harmless, yet fun way to explore/push boundaries.  
---
Perfect, I'm convinced!! Thanks =D
---
I like vanilla, but this place can suck my nut sack. 
---
What I said has nothing to do with who is gear dependent. I refer to damage scaling using extreme buff stacking that is required for raids, where certain classes scale better to meet the difficulty requirements of raid tiers.
---
At the pvp level, unless some pre-made or world pvp group uses maximum buff stacking, you won't see the scaling disparity you see at Raid levels.
---
You have official Classic forums for that.
---
Pulling from that library room is hell and the place is huge lol
---
I love the lore for this zone as well, so many elements from eliz bathory to dracula. 
---
Man that's almost as good as the Ninja one. Proof tips is just another salty streamer. 
---
Classic is hugely luck based stuff, what are you on about?  It’s not like anyone is thinking “ah gee, I’m planning these stun resists because I’m so skilled.”
---
It’s just a decision to maximize odds of a scenario to occur.  Just like crit chance, hit rating, dodge, etc.
---
Retail WoW is close to what you’re advocating for and that still relies on luck.  You want a purely skill based game, do something like Counter Strike or Starcraft or any other games that aren’t as proc based.

If you're planning on using the sword specialization talent 5% chance to double attack, you're in for a rude awakening.
---
This was by far my favorite dungeon... other than Deadmines because I was a Rogue and I loved to dick around in there.
---
Sunken Temple felt amazing and you really needed to click with your group to be efficient at it. I also made my first 1k gold item sale simply by walking into SoS, killing a whelp and getting an Emerald Whelpling pet I sold on the AH. It dropped the very first one I killed. And with Elemental LW, I ended up killing A LOT of them.
---
This and Strath are why the Plaugelands are my favorite vanilla zones.
---
Fury warrior will out DPS a rogue, but they're HEAVILY gear dependent, you won't touch a rogue in DPS if you're both in pre-raid gear.
---
The only time I ever experienced someone out threating me(as a tank) was when they were out gearing me significantly.
---
I'm always astonished by the "did you even play vanilla" responses.
---
What in the post implies to you that I haven't played it? Care to elaborate?
---
This whole sub is an absolute joke swarmed by post-wotlk brain damaged kids who never played Vanilla and want a vanilla-retail hybrid trash that the targeted audience has never asked for.
---
And no there is not plenty of time. Look no further from retail:
---
"Guys it's not release, calm down."
---
"Guys it's just alpha, calm down."
---
"Guys it's just beta, calm down."
---
""Guys it's just first month into release, calm down."
---
Seriously do you lot even have brains to use?
---
You're delusional. Any content that's posted has to be relevant to Classic, not some private server that isn't even remotely close to accurate. You piss off, subhuman filth.
---
How would sneaking onto the tram get you banned?
---
&gt; Oh, yeah, that's not a solution to having the entire concurrent pop cap of a realm in the same start zones at all. Sorry you were misled. 
---
Actual people working together to circumvent overpopulation in an MMO isn't a solution? That's rich.
---
&gt; It *is* a great argument for how any detrimental effects of sharding the starting zone can be further minimized by the natural movement of people around the level 10 range. 
---
You still haven't provided an **actual** argument as to why sharding is a necessity to improve the longevity of the game. I provided you with more than enough arguments as to why it wouldn't at all.
---
But you rather nitpick, deflect and completely ignore valid arguments.
---
&gt; Yeah, not a good look to be insulting other posters. It's against the sub's rules and will get you suspended. Also, I never personally called you a myopic numbskull. But I guess it's natural to be insulted as soon as you win the argument. :D 
---
As opposed to indirectly insult people with sarcasm &amp; generalization. I've been completely civil and respectful and just used your own words against you. It's quite obvious at this point you have no intention of actually having a decent debate. But I guess people like to live in their own unicorn fantasy land, instead of actual discussing certain hot topics as that could shatter said fantasy land.
---
Thinking you actually won this debate, is kinda cute but sad at the same time.
---
Druid attacking me? CC , mount, run away. Same with paladins.
---
Scripting and values might be off but tactics don't change that much still good info.
---
Reset exploit you might be referring to is simply camping out and it brings you to the Mara entrance. Honestly don't recall if that was in retail or not though. Time will tell.
---
Lol no. In retail there is no rolling on gear which is why I asked the question. Also in vanilla there is a need before greed loot option (most people use group loot) which will make it so you can’t roll on things you can’t wear even if it’s just a level barrier.
---
That was awesome! I had the same exact feeling when I got the Red Defias Mask too! Sweet!
---
&gt; You still haven't provided an actual argument as to why sharding is a necessity to improve the longevity of the game. 
---
Sharding is a server technology implemented so that they're not forced to create too many realms at launch. It allows you to stay true to the Vanilla-like population cap by temporarily cloning each realm (on a zone-by-zone basis) as many times as necessary in order to handle the initial flood of players.
---
So why not just create more realms at launch?
---
Because it dilutes the population six months later when all the tourists leave, resulting in low populations across the board—and leading to incredibly destructive realm-mergers (say goodbye to your name / guild's name, amongst other cultural/ranking issues.)
---
&gt; On a side-note, nobody on this entire thread actually agrees with you. So who won the debate? Let that sink in for a while.
---
The second you personally attacked me I knew I won the argument cuz you got nothing other than that. Oh, and fallacious appeals to popularity, apparently—Steven Crowder would be so proud of you!
---
&gt; Reset exploit you might be referring to is simply camping out and it brings you to the Mara entrance. Honestly don't recall if that was in retail or not though.
---
The only method of resetting instances from inside and getting teleported to the entrance that I've been able to find for retail Vanilla is [this one](http://thedruidsgrove.org/archive/wow/t-9064.html) and this was fixed. The function ResetInstances() can be called inside instances on private servers but that's not right as it's the function that's called when your party leader clicks 'Reset all instances' when the entire party is OUTSIDE the instance.
---
Shaman use a bunch of their tier sets. Full T1 makes your healing wave act as a chain heal.  Three piece T2 for the increased chain heal set bonus plus 5 piece 2.5 for the - .4 second chain heal cast time is said to be the best pre-Nax setup.   There a lot of fights where you want the three piece t1 set for extended totem range.  
---
Even if there was a mistake of having no World Boss leash in Classic, I'd simply slow them down just so much that the boss would reach them and enjoy the show.
---
That's all i wanted to hear. Classic is saved! /S
---
Lol @ you getting blown the fuck out by other people in this thread too.
---
Excellent job, OP! Loved your painting of the Drag, as well! Keep up the awesome work!
---
I hope you will be able to 10man scholo and strath. 
---
It was a huge gold sink, that was the penalty. You can pay the price if you want, otherwise go play BFA. That game is what you made it.
---
BC w/o flying would interest me more than anything tbh

Yes, good companies don't keep dead weight because they trim the fat from time to time. 
---
I think he was referring to the right click report feature being abused because there are horde being mean.
---
I think it makes Pom pyro viable, considering you can pin pyro more than 3 mins. And you could get a triple pyro if your lucky.
---
It’s also really for for elemental mage.
---
i really hope the number of reasons that "should not affect classic wow development" will someday stop growing
---
My Landlord's name was Imran Khan (article author above) and he wouldn't give me my security deposit back and ghosted me, thanks for the reminder.
---
Easier said than done. Are you a rogue? Your blind can be dispelled and sprint don't do much since you'll have fearie fire and root on you if the druid attacks you from a distance. Not to mention druids in travel form have a permanent  55% speed increase if they wear the pvp set.
---
Bingo
---
u r tbc
---
I was 100% planning on rolling a Tauren on classic. Undead just moved in as a dark horse contender because of this painting. 
---
Prot warrior. Fear, if they trinket, last until it's off CD then fear/mount.
---
Maybe they will cut the Mobile Diablo 3 reskin.
---
Today? I had a dream that they opened the beta.
---
The [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher only downloaded the installer, which was that old good Installer.exe with nochanges Installer Tome.mpq, but path 1.13.1 (with that shoe-thing icon, of course)
---
And after installing, the [battle.net](https://battle.net) was launching the vanilla launcher, which was patching things, and only after clicking play, it launched the actual game.
---
Now, I wake up with such nostalgia, and the only classic thing is thottbot...
---
then maybe it was in wotlk? idk, I remember there was such talent. Maybe even 4.0... but there was at some point.
---
&gt;For non-engineering plate-wearers: same proc as the goblin rocket helmet but with a 10min longer cooldown. Also dropped by Eric the Swift in Uldaman.
---
It's not a proc.
---
no way to play
---
now that spirit tap + innervate is an awesome trick, one I haven't heard before (or didn't recall, at least), despite maining a shadow priest through TBC... very nice, thank you for the explanation!
---
You're whole series so far have been spectacular. Can't wait to see more!
---
It was nostalgic after watching the "Holiday in Poland" ad. For some reason, the field on the movie felt like the same human vibe. Piity that in real world, Poland is just a big radioactive cloud...
---
Played with a character called Hallford in like 2009-2010 and was good friends with him in game. If I remember correctly his name was Dan. I playing with him all the time and doing stuff like climbing to the top of Ironforge and exploring different places. I think i stopped playing for a while and he switched server and I was never able to find him after that. I can see he played in 2015 but have no way to see if he has newer characters or anything like that. 
---
If anyone has been in the same situation or knows any way of finding people from WoW that would be sweet. 
---
You know what? This may cause then to lead towards adding Guild Banks.
---
 The amount of customer service issues that the lack of guild banks caused would be difficult to handle I imagine with a smaller staff.
---
Account sharing bans for guild banks and all that stuff.
---
I could accept guild banks but that would be my absolute beginning and end of changes.
---
These are really cool - thanks for sharing! 👌
---
Wrath/Cata, seems like a very big stretch, but TBC seems pretty logical if Classic if a success over 12 months+.
---
Forfty percent of people know that. 
---
Thrall might be the warchief, but Sylvanas will always be my queen B]
---
Thanks, will change.
---
A stack? You’re hopeful. 
---
World PvP is either gonna be a real shocker to those who think the other faction “Being Mean” is reportable or Blizz ruins it like some people have speculated and makes me cry. 
---
&gt;Sharding is a server technology implemented so that they're not forced to create too many realms at launch. It allows them to stay true to the Vanilla-like population cap by temporarily cloning each realm (on a zone-by-zone basis) as many times as necessary in order to handle the initial flood of players.  
---
&gt;So why not just create more realms at launch?  
---
&gt;Because it dilutes the population six months later when all the tourists leave, resulting in low populations across the board—and leading to incredibly destructive realm-mergers (say goodbye to your name / guild's name, amongst other cultural/ranking issues.)
---
I wasn't asking for the definition of sharding. I also never said anything about creating more realms at launch.
---
Also you're not giving me an actual answer as to why sharding would solve "realms becoming ghost towns 3 months" or in this newest comment you made "6 months" down the line. Which one is it 3 months, 6 months? As you've already said it would affect only the **first** hour of gameplay of your **first** character. That doesn't solve "realms becoming ghost towns" X months after release.
---
&gt; The second you had to resort to a personal attack it was clear I won this debate. That's how you know someone's arguments are wack. Oh, and weird, fallacious appeals to popularity—Steven Crowder would be so proud of you! 
---
The second I had to resort to a personal attack? Oh man, this is some good comedy right here.  
---
&gt; Myopic numbskulls, if you ask me. Not you, though. I'd never say anything bad about you. 
---
Literally in the first post you commented towards me. I'm not that daft to not see that as a "personal attack", just because it's disguised with sarcasm, doesn't mean it isn't an insult. If you can't take it, don't dish it out.
---
Had to bring up that **example** of Steven Crowder again, where I called you out on your sarcasm? Must be getting desperate.
---
Either way, you haven't brought any decent argument to table as opposed to me. Deflection, taking everything out of context and skipping pretty much all the arguments I've made. Pretty clear who the debate here.
---
There's not really any reason to prevent it aside from Kazzak. Kazzak is the only one that can sustain himself forever and require GM intervention. The others will disrupt the city for a while, but inevitably get killed.
---
I personally hate the osrs changes. They ruined skilling with PvM power creep.
---
Mained a rogue - if you don't have time to raid go warrior. It will be 'easier' to get into raids/raiding guilds. 
---
Rogues are a dime a dozen and if u don't have the time to put into it to compete for a raiding spot - good luck..
---
Warriors on the other hand will be simply accepted into raiding guilds without question usually because you could tank/offtank if needed.
---
That being said, if u you don't have the time to put into raiding it will be difficult to convince a raiding guild to bring you along. It will leave other members that put the time in, with a bad taste in their mouth (eventually).
---
Scholo was my favourite of all the Vanilla dungeons. It came with some fantastically unsettling stories. The awful fate that befell those two servants, the Ras Frostwhisper chain, the atmosphere of the dungeon, it all really brought home that the Scourge was terrifying. Take that Gandling guy, never dropped my dungeon set hat. All those runs and the prick never had it. Terrifying, I tell you.  
---
Such a shame what they did with the place in Mists. I'm so glad it's coming back. 
---
I did the quest chain for key because the xp was too good to pass up. (on private ofc, but I'll do the same on classic)
---
1: roll pve 
---
It'll happen. Once. (though more often than not, I'll be picking off the 75% valued items to repost at 100%)
---
But the point is, I'll be there. Someone posts Edgeguards cheap, I'll be there. Krol Blade, I'll be there. Daily Travelers backpack, I'll be there. Cheap herbs, I'll be there.
---
I have a few questions.
---
1. In 1.12 did Mages have the ability to sit in that sweet spot after a frost nova that is too close for ranged but too far away for melee? *(I only encountered that in TBC)*
---
2. What are the best professions for a Hunter in Classic? *(I was a miner/engineer and loved making my own ammo.)*
---
3. Speaking of ammo, will Thorium Shells be the top ammo for gun-toting Hunters in Classic?
---
I was gonna say hunter
---
Actually, Wrath isn't a stretch at all considering that's their most popular/successful era and the second highest among P servers (behind vanilla). Either way, I'd be okay with BC too.
---
Not vs undead players. Only vs mobs. 
---
I renember back in the day that I leveled my paladin and saw an undead player and couldn’t get exo off... Was also thinking that it was so unfair for undead players. 
---
I love this epic noob memories
---
Precisely.  The whole "cursed but clinging to their old life" was a powerful story.  The new architecture showed up in Wrath, but I maintain the Forsaken story turned for the worse in Cata, where they started getting cast as more solidly villainous and the Worgen swooped in and stole the cursed-but-still-human Victorian aesthetic. 
---
Undead players are not considered undead.  Yes it's lame.
---
&gt; As you've already said it would affect only the first hour of gameplay of your first character. That doesn't solve "realms becoming ghost towns" X months after release.
---
So you don't make too many realms at launch just so it's a smooth launch.
---
&gt; Pretty clear who won the debate here.
---
Lol, so triggered.
---
Like The Netherlands but haunted.
---
Love seeing this posted on here 10 times a day.
---
Dude - we do not even have a release date for Vanilla. No one knows.
---
But.. 
---
I must have spent months doing all of the quests here when I was levelling pre cataclysm - I was *fascinated* by the place, did every questline I could and then had guildies help me do the dungeon ones.
---
This is another place that cataclysm ruined - they totally removed a whole ton of the old questlines outside and in there, including one where you could transform a lich back to a human and then kill him permanently.
---
One of my funniest memories comes from this dungeon while I was trying to do one of the dungeon quests - one of my guildies was mildly to totally incompetent on his best days, but he could heal pretty well as a shaman.
---
He had an unfortunate habit of aggroing things and not noticing - which resulted at one point in him dying, rezzing and coming back in through the entrance. On his way back I've got undead tracking on for my hunter and notice a *huge* trail of red dots coming towards me just as he enters the room. I feign, just as he turns around and dies to the swarm of skeletons that was following him - and then murders everyone else in our group.
---
Man, I miss that guy, was absolutely terrible at the game but caused some of the funniest things to happen.
---
Maybe that should inform them that there's demand for it, if nothing else.
---
You either die as the ganked, or become the ganker
---
guess we'll get the facebook/google petition system - "right-click to report" "but there is no such option, because he's flagged for PVP" "then open a ticket"
---
when you try to open a ticket
---
"in order to report a player, right-click his portrait"
---
50 DKP minus. DKP = Dragon Kite Point
---
too soon
---
&gt;but if you're a lowbie flying into Org to train after leveling
---
your fault, wrong faction, my enemy. \*\*pounces and claw-spams you to death\*\*

2021: [blizzard.com](https://blizzard.com) redirects to some chinese pay-to-win slot machine
---
That's because Runescape players actually do have phones.
---
But WOW players don't.
---
And you don't have it either. You think you do, but...
---
I remember there was a Google doc circulating around a couple of months ago, I’ll try to find the link. It’s a long shot but hey
---
This was always my favorite dungeon to run. It was very challenging and the atmosphere was perfect. If you could do the whole run with no deaths you knew you were good.
---
and nothing working there, even search itself
---
Agreed. If anything they should nerf Naxx gear, definitely not create more gear that is even stronger than that.
---
I'd pay for a print of this. (I know I could print it myself but I mean as a token of appreciation to the artist).
---
Like others have so wonderfully alluded to the charm of the undead starting zones, this painting really connects with all those memories and emotions of starting out in WoW. 
---
If you really wanna get snobbish about it. I think this painting has great depth to it. It really draws me in.
---
Thanks!
---
Hi, /u/benji5ever
---
Rule #1 Avoid power creep like the plague
---
&gt; So you don't make too many realms at launch
---
That's something I actually agree on. However that still didn't my answer my question as to why sharding would solve "dead realms" and is completely besides the point.
---
&gt;No need to get triggered. Calm down, it's okay to take the L when you have to.
---
You've got it the other way around. I'm perfectly calm and didn't get triggered once during this entire one-sided "discussion". It's just a shame I didn't get any actual answers throughout the thread, as you seem like someone that's quite articulate. Although, I learned that the actual realm caps were increased during vanilla, which is something I suppose.
---
I'll leave it at that, as this isn't productive or intellectually stimulating at all.
---
Plenty of people have entered their information on the site below!
---
http://vanillafriends.com/
---
what is a link to non-classic wowhead doing on this subreddit? mods, ban it, now!
---
Correction: [https://classic.wowhead.com/news=290177/thottbot-visual-theme-now-live-on-classic-wowhead-site](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=290177/thottbot-visual-theme-now-live-on-classic-wowhead-site)
---
Awesome, sweet to look into someone else's screens
---
They probably lost people with strong skills and high career mobility doing that..  I have a friend that took a buy out like that years ago, put the cash down on his mortgage and was working for the competition in 2 weeks.   It was just a stack of free cash for changing jobs...
---
Undead players were considered undead only briefly after release. They were later patched to be humanoid IIRC.
---
Probably because of balance issues with paladins.
---
I don’t think its the claws thats gonna kill em, its the pure cringe from seeing a furry that will
---
Dude I know. Guy in my guild was so pissed cause he had done 300+ runs and it still hadn't dropped.  It's honestly a shame they removed the dungeon set and class quests. They gave such a sense of identity.
---
With no gms it’s gonna be great winning a roll against 4 other people abusing the loot trading system, then you getting spam reported because you won the roll and the 4 people didn’t. 
---
Most likely. But this also means we’ll be slowly sliding down the same path that made wow mediocre today.
---
&gt; Can you provide evidence or ANY details on the make-believe video you're saying I produced?
---
How can he produce the evidence when few months ago you deleted almost all of your videos you liar?
---
This place reminded me of the first time I walked into the Tristram church...every time I ran it. 
---
Druids can still. Or, at least, used to be that way in WoD. It's all so fast, I'm losing track...
---
I don't know the answer to your question, but I love that you're having to ask it.  Is it a mistake?  Is it simulated 2004 internet?  Who knows?  Classic!
---
löl I recall dueling another druid at some low level.
---
Basically mutual wrath and healing until oom. Eventually made it to full mana and full HP again.
---
&gt; scanning the AH
---
How do you scan on one monitor while playing on another?
---
Just curious. Am new. Thx!
---
Why? Well, one shred will fall too, but it's clawssi... claws, that will do the big part.
---
Anyway, Clawssi... classic!
---
well in the case, griefing is part of the pvp, i guess :p
---
it's hilariously i'm being downvoted for speaking the truth.. i'm sure none of those downvoters ever rage logged after having the shit griefed out of them :D
---
This is indeed correct. 
---
Joke's on them. Abusing the system like that will get them permanently banned. 
---
Please try r/wowservers for private server discussion. This subreddit is for Classic WoW (Rule #1).
---
What a pearl thanks for sharing.
---
Only if you view Vanilla as the "best." I certainly don't. The things that ruined this game over time were expressed most fully with Mists and onward (outside of Raid Finder, but that's a whole other topic). Vanilla has a whole litany of issues that degrade continued play, but many players give it a pass on the back of nostalgia and how bad retail became. There are some who legitimately found it best, but I don't think the game would have been so successful in the long wrong if it remained in that state indefinitely.
---
Mcconnelret is right lol
---
They were, but it was mostly because being considered undead in PvP was op as fuck.
---
Immune to fear/charm/sleep, sap, and poly was pretty gamebreaking. Even tho there was pvp system at the time, undead were pretty much immune to all normal forms of CC.
---
- a) have 2 monitors
---
- b) have 2 accounts
---
I play on monitor 1. I look occasionally at monitor 2 to see if there's any deals.
---
further details: log into wow with account 2 on monitor 1. Set to windowed 1280x720 and move window to monitor 2. Then run launcher again and run main account and play normally.
---
They know.
---
And as said this has been posted a million times.
---
Blizzard said when asked about it that they won't answer, they want to concentrate on bringing out Classic first.
---
I'm pretty sure there will be expansion servers eventually. They have the team. It's a small investment for a large payoff. Everyone can play their favorite expansion(s) forever. A lot of people will never unsubscribe. :)
---
(Note: If Blizzard is not completely daft, all expansions will have their own servers. No forced upgrading.)
---
LF3M Deadmines, need Mage, Rogue, Warrior, Link AOTC, ilvl 20+
---
*shudder*
---
Vanilla was not perfect, but what ruined wow is subjective for each person and for many people, the list starts from TBC (flying mounts, resilience).
---
Vanilla is flawed, but we can all agree it is entertaining.
---
Wtf dude. Did you play this game even once?
---
Have you even read the talenttext? Have you read the spelltext?
---
Your question makes no sense.
---
This is how I, personally, am going to be leveling my warlock. This is a good spec for PvP and it works well in PvE also. I'm glad I was able to inspire a little bit of discussion about the warlock trees. I gotta say, I don't really understand all the downvotes, but who cares. 
---
Dungeon/raid cc.
---
Any profession that has a 24h c/d for creating advanced materials are usually pretty good.
---
LW can do Cured Rugged Hides,
---
Alchemy, the most profitable, can transmute arcanite,
---
Enchanting can do Mooncloth(?) and Enchanted leather.
---
Or is it Tailoring that does Mooncloth, I forgot tbh. Never rolled one.
---
Completely different spells for diferente situations. You can Entangling a warrior trying to kill your friend for exemple. 
---
And NG has a huge cd while ER is spammable.
---
Along with everyone else
---
You guys act like private servers don’t exist 
---
When you mistakenly pull two melee mobs while leveling, you instant cast NG, let it proc on one, then swag strafe hop out of his range while you deal with his buddy. He will just stand still in awe at your skills as he is unable to hit you while you kill his friend right in front of him. Otherwise you might have looked like a jerk off trying to cast an entangle while two melee mobs were constantly bumping back your cast. That’s why naturesgrasp is good
---
It's hard to say but once it happens I always wish I had chosen male. Even if I don't think the male character is as visually appealing as the female I've never regretted making the character male.
---
If you already plan to have a character or two at 60, a bank alt and then a twink in the 39 bracket+, then you already will be spending time by simply playing the game on those characters.
---
I agree that leveling up a character for the sole purpose of having a profession may not be worth it, but it definitely worth it to have an alt take on the side money making professions and leave stuff like engineering on your main.
---
Lol. Perhaps you would want to entangle a Warrior BEFORE he charges you. Derp :P
---
Yes! People forget that he started to grow up to the warchief role and would have been a perfect opportunity for character growth, until blizz completely fucked it up. And then the reason he went bonkers? "Corrupted by some random evil shit we just made up"...
---
BC is best, Wrath is still great... but they never recaptured the feeling places like Blackrock Depths/Spire and Scholomance gave. As much as I love other xpacs more and would rather play it, the city-like dungeons are the biggest draw for me to play Classic. 
---
I’m sure very few groups will actually get lost in these dungeons know, so long as 1 of 5 people knows their way. But navigating through it is always fun, with trash packs around every corner, spellcasters and patrols trying to ruin your night. An eerie oppressing vibe, almost as though you were in a dungeon, and not a hallway designed to shovel you loot in the most formulaically efficient manner.
---
If they re-do Burning Crusade, I’m officially on the changes camp... add 1 or 3 dungeons like BRD, just to satisfy that itch!
---
I actually forgot that Personal Loot is forced. It doesn't really matter though because ever since they introduced the armor type bonuses for classes you wouldn't ever really need another armor type. My point was that Blizzard limited player choice with the LFD I believe, to prevent griefing.
---
Even at 60, I enjoy just doing full runs. It’s no
---
Surprise doing the same 4 bosses over and over every 20 minutes, for hours, would get old. I’m glad I played a mage and never needed much from endgame BRD... I’m going HPal in Classic, so I’m thankful hand of justice isn’t in my sights.
---
Hi, /u/Surrender01
---
Probably will see BC/Wrath severs in some form if Classic goes well but probably not Cata, it was the beginning of the steep downfall of wow 
---
I remember there was a [ghost family outside](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ghosts_of_Caer_Darrow_quest_chain) that eventually enabled you to [see the ghosts of that island.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spectral_Essence) That whole area of Western Plaguelands was incredibly spooky and fun to read all of what happens in that horrible school.
---
That's why I play druid. 
---
Its also that a lot of people dont trust the majority of wow players aka the casuals
---
If only they existed. 
---
Shadow priests have mana issues in Vanilla.  If you want to do good dps - by which i mean not wanding for the second half of the fight - then you have to farm a ton of mana regen consumables.  Dark Runes / Demonic Runes and Major Mana Potions *on cooldown* for every boss fight (unless you are in an OP guild that kills stuff in 30 seconds).   Also you will need mana buffs like Nightfin Soup for extra mp5.  Oh and you'll probably want your damage consumables too like Flasks, mage oil etc... 
---
We had a shadow priest that put the time in and was able to keep his damage up.  Top tier DPS if you can keep your mana up.
---
Just FYI, I'll probably be a warlock so I say go for it and give me that sweet shadow damage buff :)
---
Uh, does your site really load ALL 4254 entries every time the [Find Friends](http://vanillafriends.com/find-friends/) link is clicked?
---
Druids
---
Fair point. When leveling a warrior I hope for the drops and use the quest rewards as my fall back. I'm not a fan of farming a low level dungeon multiple times for a drop.
---
Maybe not bad, but different. Thrall had a different uprising and different goals for the “horde” than the standard warchiefs. He did not want to see it conquer, but to see it free.
---
Also you can’t ignore the fact that he is the main reason the orcs got a second chance in Azeroth. After the crushing defeat of the Second War he ralied the remaining free orcs, Hellscream and Doomhammer (veteran leaders) under him and freed the ones in internment camps.
---
Everything... beyond, with Cataclysm... is debatable. I don’t follow the modern lore. Too meh.
---
Mage 8/8 T2 is quite good.
---
Just an amazingly tuned 5 man tactical experience making your way methodically through this place.
---
Guess I haven’t seen that one yet. 
---
mainl the search  and a few icons are not working.  You can still
---
- See what skills a class learns at what level
---
- look at the class quests
---
- look at professions
---
- you can even see the item ( albeit just as a list )
---
Is it optimal? No. But if you use atlas loot and that you can comfortable get by. If you dont like it - nobody is forcing you. I was just pointing out *a* alternative to a person that also does not want to have to log in.
---
And who does the banning? GM’s... which we won’t have much of. There’s bound to be people who fall through the cracks and get shafted 
---
Rogues.
---
Pick one player, kill them during 1 cheap shot... run away... rinse and repeat.
---
No
---
I lol’d our loud. Very rare. Thx man!
---
Stacking content patches is bad design. Rather have 8 content patches than 4.
---
The guy with the most DKP.
---
How would this possibly *effect* classic development, they are way past that stage by now 
---
Shadow priests have mana issues in Vanilla.  You will have to farm and use Dark/Demonic Runes and Major Mana Potions on cooldown or you will wand for the last part/half of most fights.  Also Nightfin soup and other mp5 buffs.  They do great dps if they can keep their mana up the entire boss fight.  Just FYI.
---
Isn't that idea similar to respeccing costs in classic?
---
Dude it was already popular before the app.
---
I miss real dungeons! Not these linear, zerg fest dungeons we have now. 
---
Who said you can't? Even if they implement the other expensions, they can alter it to the needs of classic.
---
Vanilla didn’t have an achievement tab. In vanilla you wore them.
---
Maybe ruined for you, yet we all voted for the changes.
---
I didn’t see they can’t, I said it makes more sense to add more content after the content that exists (up to naxx) is completed. 
---
will do! thank you! :)
---
Whats your point exactly? Nobody said they wouldn't change the game.
---
I don't know why I haven't thought about that, but will try to cross post it, thanks! thank you! :)
---
Mage. Iceblock the rogue while rest of mages poly. And blizzard them out of stealth.
---
New content we vote for, whats your point?
---
&gt;Agreed!  I love hearing people’s kind and interesting explanations on their perspective.
---
So here's mine! I understand people who can only identify to human male characters, but I don't really care about gender. I'm a bit of a lore guy, but I really struggle to identify to races who can live thousands of years. Without pretending that i'm my character (never played on rp server), I like to know how he or she would react to a situation and I can't get in the head of a 10.000 years old character. I can't build a good backstory when it's like "well he did that, then 2500 years later he did that as well, what a guy". Dwarves and gnomes can live long but they are way more "down to earth" than say an elf or a draenei (although gnomish state of mind is also difficult to deal with) so I'm mostly fine with them. Don't like humans cause I find them boring, and taurens look too slow to me. So my favourite races usually are dwarves, gnomes, orcs, trolls and UD. That being said it's more difficult in Classic, due to racials and limited cosmetic options. For example, while I love the idea of a dwarf hunter, I don't want to use a bow with an elven name and flowers on it when I'm 60.
---
my point is, what every person beside you seem to get, that wow has no new content
---
This is the mentality we need. I think the are a lot of possibilities with classic but a lot of people fail to see that. We can make it like osrs by having vanilla like changes.
---
8/8 t1 is pretty good for shaman.
---
Yaa it really feels like dejavu how people bash on vanilla for being just nostalgia.
---
only with dm loot
---
Nature's Grasp is essentially like a buff that instantly entangles an enemy who hits the druid. However, I think it only works with melee hits. (And hunters? Correct me if I'm wrong) 
---
Therefore, you might need to actually cast it for any enemy casters. 
---
NG also had a cooldown, so there's that. 
---
Entangling Roots is just a good way of kiting and keep people off you or your allies. 
---
5 ele shamans, not even a contest.
---
This pic makes me want to roll a fresh* undead alt. It ooooozes everything I love about those starting zones.
---
*rotten
---
1. Yes 2. Depends on your needs. Alch is good if you wanting to raid. Eng isn't quite as good because the pet cancels the grenade stun. 3. I think so.

Excellent choice - I love war stomp.  I say go both.  I would lean towards a shaman as your main raiding character.  Make the druid your farming alt and make it feral mining herbalism.  Feral druids can sneak to hard-to-get-to nodes behind elite mobs.  They can CC with entangling roots.  They have stealth, which I mentioned above but is twice as important as everything else :)  They are pretty good at just farming stuff if you want to camp beside a black lotus spawn and hope to get lucky.  That way your shaman is an alchemist / &lt;whatever&gt; and you can get the epic recipies from raids.
---
thank you man!

painting stuff like this is my comfort zone for many reasons. having a real passion and fondness for what you are painting helps to ease the stress that usually comes with trying to improve your 'technique'. and the more you like what you paint, the more time you want to spend on it, adding all those small details :)

(also I just uploaded a print version of this to inprnt if you want to grab one: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/the-haunted-mills/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/the-haunted-mills/) )

5 paladins. Bubble, hearth. No way the other class can win.

roots arent on a 45 sec cooldown, and has a 40 yard range

Enchanting is insanely expensive to level with.  Your main source of money leveling up is selling greens to vendors.  The amount of money that sucks out of you is insane, plus you don't make it back on the enchants.  With leatherworking or tailoring I can vendor back my product to mitigate losses.  No one wants to buy enchants leveling up (except for a few specific ones), most of the money you make on enchanting is when you are higher level.
---
I think enchanting is a bad idea to level with.  You can always make a lvl 5 bank alt to DE stuff if you really don't want to vendor your greens.
---
For Lady Sylvanas!
---
With regards to end game scaling, hunters fall off quite fast after MC content because the pets don't scale with gear. This applies to PVP and PVE.
---
Damn this threat derailed hard. Mods ?
---
I for one hope the go the same route Everquest did and do time locked progression servers. Release 2-3 different ones each year with different release schedules and do rates. Could be really fun.
---
T1 can be  really good for pvp
---
Yeah fair enough.  I see your point and you’re probably right that it plays into it.
---
This was true in the release version, but was quickly patched out as a player who was immune to fear was incredibly OP. 
---
Hmm, loading is slower than it should. Will look into it!
---
&gt;Also each have pretty annoyingly long quest chains, so you'll never feel too behind from another on those.
---
And the most annoying are aquatic form/water totem quests and they both take place in Silverpine so they could do the trip together at lvl 20 with their speed increase.
---
That would be pretty rough considering a bunch of places in BC can only be gotten to with flying, including one of the raids.
---
I think there is a video of a multiboxer with 5 elemental shamans and it is every bit as satisfying as you might think.
---
I hope you're exaggerating with the "stuff that gets you banned", since I seriously doubt that even Blizzard would care about these things.
---
they were never considered undead in retail but they were during the beta. For release they had already gone with the 'will of the forsaken' route
---
I love how this place is just pure evil - the lore behind it and the entire zone was so solid, it immersed you completely. It really felt like you were part of this grim horror-thriller series as you slowly discovered what happened here. So cool! :)
---
this site freezes my chrome tab for a solid minute and brings my cpu to 90%, which is very impressive for a CRUD web app. i originally thought you had installed a cryptominer
---
Don't remind me. Rant incoming. Got to 7/8 T2, and never got those damn shoulders. Guild got to Cthun and 4 Horsemen, with BWL basically on farm status, but Chromaggus wouldn't drop those fucking shoulders! I would always save dkp for the bwl farm runs to make sure I had enough, even though the guild had an unspoken rule that someone finishing a tier set would be given a priority regardless.
---
Anyways, I eventually give up on ever getting 8/8 Netherwind, spend my dkp elsewhere, and then of course, they drop, and another mage with more dkp took them. I will always hate you, Irontiki from Frostmane.
---
I hope the improved MOTW will correctly update the tooltip this time round.
---
Yeah I think for at least the release of the game the focus should be on making classic as close to vanilla as possible. 
---
They might make little tweaks but I do not see them adding new content to Classic.
---
Jagex is a rare instance of where they gave a little team control and it ended up paying off huge for them.
---
I love it, this came out really well. I'd totally buy this. I feel like people wouldn't know what it is, and would never guess that it's from WoW. Always loved the mood in Tirisfal/Silverpine, though.
---
It could be argued that companies like Activision and their customers have the same viewpoint on whether changes are good or bad. Delivering a satisfying product the customer wants is beneficial to both parties.
---
This fight would never end! lmao
---
The only homogenisation of classes has been about buffs. Running smaller raids is easier when you don't need specific classes just for the one buff. Bring the player not the class. 
---
I won't even talk about how classes nowadays are actually a ton more flavorful and don't rely on one or two spells to distinguish themselves from each other. Wow PvE gameplayer nowadays a millions of times healthier than it was in vanilla. It's more mechanic centric, it's less one button spammy and it doesn't require you to turn away your friends because they don't play the right class/spec. 
---
"If we can't win, nobody else can either!"
---
To be clear: these are the single target buffs, not the later group buffs which still required a reagent. This is taken from the 1.1.1 patch notes.
---
I mean...imagine having to spend a reagent *every time* you cast your single target buff. o.O
---
Oh wow so clueless. A lot of people are gonna get a reality check when Classic releases. There’s already guilds planning to clear MC before the FIRST server reset, let alone 2nd. 
---
You do not need sands for chromaggus at all. 
---
Mccuck is a perennial troll. He survives and thrives off of people taking him seriously and getting response, just like this lol. The guy doesnt deserve a response
---
can't react to 5 simultaneous ambushes tho, it would be an interesting fight as the 4 mages try to struggle to get them all slowed. Rogues have temprorary advantage while the mages quickly grow in the power the more cooldowns they survive 
---
Is there a game called loadout I don’t know about?
---
Hunters are pretty much top dps in the first raid tier. 
---
mages could just aoe all day so rogues never get to ambush :P
---
Rogues
---
5x ambush=insta-death
---
Sprint/vanish
---
Wait for CDs, repeat
---
I'm taking my buffs and going home. 
---
You went full Go'el. Never go full Go'el.
---
I'm pretty sure it's impossible to clear MC in the first week simply because of the quests needed to douse the 4 runes.
---
mage or lock
---
I don’t know about 5. I remember an old video from vanilla or tbc that was 10 warlocks in a wsg. It was about as hilarious as you might imagine...
---
The shit you write in your screenshots make you seem like a 
---
" Vanilla Good Modern WoW bad " simpleton.
---
Reported for going to the Tram as Horde? Why the fuck would that happen?
---
i never got far in Vanilla so classic Scholomance looks as if it will be really cool and fun to do like count less other dungeons
---
Druids are one of the worst classes to stack, you can only have 1 hot on at a time. They would get very wrecked by 5 warlocks/5 priests and would never kill anyone on a 5 paly team.
---
Tbh you're killing it.  
---
You should repaint the entire Original WoW cinematic frame by frame and animate it. Should be done by the time KT dies in Classic.  
---
I plan to play Classic just for this dungeon alone. Even if I become no more a MC scrub it was worth getting to this dungeon again. 
---
If they spam aoe, rogues can wait and they'll run out of mana. Can't cover all directions, unless they are standing directly on top of each other, but then they'll still run out of mana 
---
lmao that's bs my friend  
---
i played on k2 and there was nothing noticable, especially market inflation  
---
you're just straight up lying about that, wpvp ganking is plausable tho. Makes the game more alive, so a good thing.  
---
The Barov family have a couple of quest chains
---
Each mage takes turns rank 1 blizzards, they’d never go oom
---
I think 5 pallies would beat them if you’re talking 5 players vs 5 players, not multi boxing. You might blow up 1 pally but the healing/bubbles/stuns would be insane and they’d easily win the 4v5 afterwards.
---
I cannot wait to see this line in group chat "does anyone need Jandice or can we skip that B**ch"
---
Ya but turn evil and exorcism made it balanced!
---
Shackle too - I think it would have been a lot more interesting having that variety in the game, with the right tweaks.
---
Shamans could all just ghost wolf/run away.
---
Only a stupid shaman or one caught out of position can be really killed by a paladin. Even their BoF can be purged and then snared to gain distance.
---
Seems like you’re on a mission to get downvoted, not sure why you’re complaining about downvoted with that attitude rofl..
---
All of my time in Vanilla WoW was spent on an RP server, so i dont have quite what you’re looking for but it may help. 
---
First off the talent pool was much more limited, i think the absolute best Guilds across both factions only downed 1-3 Naxx bosses TOPS. Only 1 guild per faction ever saw the inside before BC.  
---
Second, the RP part of the server was rarely seen. For the most part it was just slower paced pve like you theorized. 
---
Id expect Rp-PvP servers just bring in a tier higher on talent pool, but again I only played on an RP server then so im not the authority on that.
---
From my experiences on an RP server to start and exclusively PvP afterwards, I myself will be trying out Rp-Pvp when Classic Launches.
---
She might be a bit murderous, but she's our one true queen. Power to the Forsaken!
---
This is amazing. Well done!
---
There are add-ons that let you mail more than 1 item at a time.
---
fair enough, if you can get the mages to coordinate that well then they deserve the win, although the fight would never start as the rogues would just unstealth.
---
Yeah any changes need a 80% approval. And it breaks it down pretty specifically so let’s say there’s a vote for a content patch but beneath it each individual feature, improvement, and quest gets approved too. It’s pretty impressive how they do it actually 
---
5 ambushes wouldn't work, because you'd have to get 5 people behind one person that isn't standing still, and the occasional Arcane Explosion could ruin the whole plan. I suppose you could cheap shot with one and the rest of the rogues blow one mage up, but then the cat's out of the bag and they all get lit up. 
---
Also, if any one of those mages is Human with Perception, that could throw another wrench in the plans.
---
I think a good percentage of the people that play vanilla will be thinking the same way as you. I also think rp-pvp servers will definitely be on the less popular side; Pvp servers will probably be more popular and there will always be a "casual" crowd you could roll with.
