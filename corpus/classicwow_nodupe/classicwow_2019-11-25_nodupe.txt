Usual time is 8-10 days played. For a mage aoe grinding it can be faster. Lvl 45 is considered halfway

Nobody knows what it's suppose to be like because WoW Classic is basically a new game.  It's now part of the game like it or not.  Except for the loss of time due to corpse walking you don't really lose anything.  Just be patient and you will get there.
---

---
Everywhere I see people complaining about the pvp but I'm leveling an alt right now and it's fine.  I die 5-6x/h due to pvp but there's no loss of experience or gear when dying so it's not too bad.  I remember playing a rogue back in TBC and STV was 10x worst than it is right now.
---
I love how everyone assumes this person screwed over their group by taking this... Very likely as well that they were in a group with people who already had it, or with all people who didn’t need it.   
---
Also, totally boosts poison damage. And I believe the ratio is like 3:1 with spell power, like 87 extra poison damage per hit now.
---
What a surprise. That was the prediction.
---
U can but iirc backstab/ambush requires a dagger in MH
---
I’m in the same boat, lvl 48 rogue wielding thrash blade and Shadowblade each w/ fiery. Absolutely destroyed a 60 horde mage on Incendius (Repost I’m talking to you) when I gave him the big dick damage. Oh, and he even got the opener on me.... lol I love it. But yeah searing gorge and anywhere with death squads rolling around are cancer
---
Damn that's a badass drawing.

Don't let the door hit ya on the way out tossa

Horde have been occupying the Menethil / Theramore boat every day since Honor update went live. There's not much rhyme or reason, they're very vulnerable there, but... well. They're destroying lowbies.

That is pretty spiffy. I underestimated you hammer swingers!
---
Yeah in world pvp if youre fighting more than one caster youre usally fucked as a warrior because armor doesn't negate spell damage. Warriors and rogues are not very effective in the current zerg fest that world pvp is
---
Be gone scrub.
---
Sweet, sweet level 54 epic mount.....................
---
Anyway, the point is they could have acquired the loot at 54 and equipped them the moment they hit 60, completely denying the above statement.
---
Not sure why I had to explain that in a classic sub.
---
um
---
I feel like whenever there is an event or something alliance is able to compete as Salad Bakers is also very active and able to gather alot of manpower very quickly. But I ran to DM today and probably died like 15 Times there on my way to DM:North. But it's fine. I guess it could be worse
---
Believe it or not, some servers have far more alliance than horde.
---
OwO
---
You forgot to white out your nameplate, bud...
---
Death!!!
---
Say you don’t know.
---
At the same time you as a tank require some level of confidence and to be leading the group. That’s your role. There’s guides for instances like on wow head pretty in depth you can follow along through the instance.
---
Contested areas.
---
Oof, Alliance side login stats for Faerlina are about to crater.
---
The thing is the issue isn't really PvP happening, if that was the case then whining would have happened in P1 where lots of PvP, camping, ganking, city/town raids still happened.
---
If you look think about it more, a lot of the whining is really about PvP in the context of no BGs, overpopulated realms, faction imbalance, modern gaming with a "solved" game and perhaps the timing of the honour system. 
---
Somr of this could have been avoided if Blizzard were more competent and both Blizz and players had better foresight.
---
Though a lot of it was predicted/expected to be fair, so people should have know what they where getting into, nevertheless it's still a bit disappointing how it turned out.

Wait... That's illigal!
---
Yea, this guy breathes through his mouth and bumps into walls 100%
---
What's confusing? We are talking about pvp crits not PvE crit in 40 man raids. 1400ish is about standard for level 60 in pvp with pre raid BIS gear.
---
Level 53 is not critting 1400 unless for some reason he has twinked out.
---
This hits way too close to home, warlocks criting away with no threat redux. Think People Will adapt pretty fast to minor mechanics but big things like nef and twins Will put a stop.
---
Just report him already.  Blizzard looks down on harassment, even on a pvp server.  They many not do anything against him now, but if he has a pattern of it they'll take note on a later offense (and he's the type of person who that will definitely happen).
---
Was he getting dominated too much in PvP?
---
Cheers will have a look into it ! :)

I will start off by saying I am not a good player. I get lost in the simplest dungeons. 
---
When I played a warrior I made it clear I was a meat shield and nothing more. I will hit things and keep aggro and do a fine job at that. 
---
I don’t know the path, I don’t know who to hit first I am possible the stupidest tank  who ever played.
---
Why are you having charge on 1 in Beserker stance?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Put charge on 1 in battle and intercept on 1 in beserker. easier.
---
Yea I’m just dreaming lol. Way too many hours for that. My first real, bis twink was a dual wield warrior level 39, so I might go for that then level him up to 49 for those beast mortal strikes with Kang the Decapitator. I also loved the 20-29 bracket as a warrior. Felt like such a tank.
---
I also have pendulum of doom which I’m gonna save if BC comes out so I can equip that on my shaman.

Nothing he said was wrong though.

---
Idk all these world PvP posts are from an alliance perspective even tho both sides do it
---
Alright, thanks for the clarification.
---
its not tho
---
Alright. Thanks for the clarification.
---
The "wait for mana" is appropriate in some groups for sure. However, if your group is good and the tanks not done, a couple casters can drink for the first 15 seconds of a fight before engaging in combat which has the side benefit of letting the tank get aggro. Now when I'm in a group where the tank cant hold aggro then I'm constantly telling him to let me drink because I know I'll need it all.
---
I’m a 49 rogue and have played rogue since vanilla. Don’t even both with stealth unless you need to skips mobs or for PvP to get an opener. It’s worthless and will slow you down far too much. Second, rogues are big on weapons. You essentially need to get the best weapons possible every 5-10 levels, this will help dramatically. But yeah, it’s kind of brutal. Leveling any class in the 30s and 40s sucks to be honest.
---
I love when tanks actually let the appropriate people mark and pull. It’s not always ideal for tanks to pull in every situation anyways. I’d rather hear from you that you’re new and need help than you pretend to know what to do and waste our time by wiping us over and over. Thank you for being vocal with people about needing help. It’s something we can all learn to do both in and out of WoW
---
I’ve done this before to people that were continually ganking mine or my guildies alts
---
Me and my friend getting spawn-killed, and then they camp right next to the fucking graveyard so we can’t get anywhere is no ~minor~ inconvenience. Sure it’s a part of the game, but that thing is just disgusting
---
Your main role as a priest in a premade is dispelling, after that comes healing / clutch fears, then blackout procs on flag carriers from rank1 SW:P. I didn't enjoy it but at least in 1v1 I was a beast.
---
Your always happy until you run strat ud and realise no one can dispel poison
---
You probably can't see *all* the content in Classic - Naxx saw ~90% of guilds that attempt it fail short of C'thun.
---
But you can see a lot of it.
---
Allies are 100% more cowardly
---
There were server transfers in classic.  There weren’t the populations we have today.
---
Yes and no good guild requires their members to get these kind of incredibly rare bis items, the next best reasonably obtainable bis item is perfectly acceptable.
---
Yeah I do not actually believe that people who play alliance are more honorable or better people. But it is much more likely at the moment to have this done to you by horde than alliance. Plus almost all (all but one?) of those are PvE.
---
It's funny because there was a lengthy period where only horde circlejerking was upvoted, that is until phase 2 came
---
assumption andy
---
And alliance on Stalagg too, my man
---
Nah, you should be life tapping, just space them out between casts so you don't go from 100% to 10% hp in 5 seconds, making the healer panic to "save" you because they think you just pulled something.
---
I ain't the one downvoting you, numb nuts :D :D :D
---
Just start your own group, get 2 others and head to the instance. Then look for tank/healer there and mention you can summon. I've joined so many random dungeons as a tank just because I saw they could summon.
---
No party necessary, it’s a solo farm. Some people might be using an alt account to reset the instance faster but not a requirement. 
---
I died many times when I was first starting it. You will get the hang of it after some practice, and don’t be afraid to start smaller in the beginning. (Clearing GY in 5-6 pulls for practice). 
---
I’ve farmed &gt; 2000g now and do it in 3 pulls. 
---
Stack int and Stam gear like the above poster mentioned, and don’t be afraid to use the greater health and mana potions you pick up while you’re farming to save your ass. 
---
If you have any questions on strategy or anything feel free to pm me
---
20hour per week= casual 
---
OK.
---
You can see all the content, but forget to loot anything unless you are a druid or shaman. 40 raiders and 2 items per boss, ofc the item goes to RL's best friends or those no lifers who play 24/7 and attend all raids with endless consumables.
---
Saying a warlock with tier shoulders on a level 60, non warlock, epic mount probably just dinged 60 and is a glass cannon to explain why he died so easily in a compilation video of dozens of examples of it working fine against level 60 targets, along with an explanation on how it works, is definitely some Chinese levels of mental gymnastics.
---
If it makes you feel any better, that same warlock replied to confirm he's 4k+ HP unbuffed and has been 60 since mid-september.
---
As opposed to clicking frost bolt 17 times in a row....
---
As if they have girls.
---
My plan: Stop logging on.
---
Majority of 60s looking for pvp ignore players under level 50, cause they aren't worth any honor. You should be fine until then.
---
Watch a video, novice.
---
Or, you can take a few minutes to look up  the dungeon and understand the layout and enemies? You sound like the type of person who shows up to raids and don't know the mechanics, wiping everyone and slowing things down.
---
It’s definitely far from dead, not sure what server you’re playing on or if you play at all.
---
what the fuck
---
It is amazing seeing so many people bitch about pvp servers the last couple weeks. You guys bitched about them with long queues too. Myzrael has been a dream the entire time classic has been out. Enjoy getting ganked scrubs!

---
Not everyone wants to be shoehorned into being a support though. A paladin is one of the most common sets of lore in MMO games; there’s no way that every Paladin wants to only be a secondary support
---
&gt; I just don’t know pulls in some of the dungeons that I never got to really do in Vanilla.
---
Why not try running everything once as a dps warrior? let someone else tank the dungeon for your first time through so you know what to do when you try next time?
---
Yeah, and that’s acceptable to me, but doing this to some random person (op says it was random) is just f’d up to me.
---
Yep all good, the mechanics of raiding back in classic are very simple with onyxia and MC proving very little effort for for the majority of guilds.
---
Mainly because people now have guides to tell them how to spec, what to do and what items to equip. 
---
So a bit different from the real days of classic where a lot of people didn’t really know about the importance of +hit and +weapon skills (for example). The result being is bosses are downed quickly without much issue.
---
With that said... a word of warning. Be very careful about selecting the sever you are on and the type of server. 
---
As there’s no faction cap on the servers you may well end up on one that has a big ratio difference between horde Vs alliance. If that server is then PvP enabled then you could be stepping into a very challenging environment. 
---
On my PvP server all +48 zones are heavily camped with a lot of the open world, instances and flight points actively patrolled by groups of level 60’s looking to rank 24/7. That means if you are levelling 30-40 minutes of corpse running to instances, death as you land from flying to a point and many of the open world quests left inaccessible.
---
People argue that the release of battlegrounds will clear this up, but we will have to see.
---
Still looking forward to all the 40 man raiding goodness to come though.
---
Good luck, it took me like 50 resets to find him.. first time wand didnt drop, got more lucky after another 50 scouts.
---
Nah, they got fucking decimated everywhere they went. Asmon couldn't even play.
---
My alt is a druid.  My main is a warlock.  It amazes me how many warlocks don't know how to manage their mana.
---
its because of faerie fire for the warriors. Feral druid FF has 6sec CD, which is a huge DPS loss if its resisted. 
---
Boomkin FF resist? no problem, no cooldown. just recast
---
Thx bro, esp if you were my offtank in that ubrs run
---
I think it’s because many ppl have played vanilla. And classic is sort of a thing that does not progress. It’s set in time sort of. 
---
That means players needs something different to do.....cause you can’t take your achievements and drops with you in the future as you can in retail.
---
So the massive ganking is sort of a desperate cry to do something purposeful in a way.
---
7 days played is average. You can do it much faster if you aoe farm.
---
[deleted]
---
I've been using Zygor for years, i could not play this game without ^^
---
That sounda about right. Horde usually have a tentative hold on things like brm and dm but if we roll in as a group (or raid in brm case) it can be broken, if temporarily. 
---
Open world it's pretty bad most zones you run into lots of horde but hey dungeons exist lol
---
I think that honestly doing it solo with a 100% to get it if it drops would be way better than doing it with others , having it drop and then losing the roll. 
---
I had to kill anger 90 times to even SEE it drop. Then I Lost. 
---
Now I’ll have to farm him god knows how many other times before I even have a chance to roll on it again. And possibly lose. 
---
Unless you can find someone who doesn’t need it. Have them agree to taking all the blue drops for gold that aren’t HOJ. That might be a trade off someone is willing to do.
---
I wasn't gonna be super forward and say it, but you're really stupid if you expected a 36 warrior to hit for 3600 damage, or even close to it.
---
I can't imagine being this buttmad over semantics. Most people understand what "one-shot" means in this context, and you come off as a pedantic loser for getting hung up on the terminology instead of the content.
---
Hundreds of 60's online, many guilds transferring over, tons of people in Orgrimmar, many WPvP raids going on atm, Heartseeker Horde is improving!
---
Join before they stop the transfers!
---
I hope I don't upset you or anyone by saying this but what I did and suggest new tanks do is run it once as a dps first before you try tanking it. warriors are amazing dps as well as tanks so it might be easier learn without being in the driver seat.
---
Don't forget that there are a also a lot of guilds struggling to clear MC
---
A reasonable thought on this subreddit?  Gtfo!  /s

Who?
---
I did that back in TBC, moved to Auckland. After a while I couldn't handle the raid times and had to quit and reroll on an OCE server. Sucks dude :(
---
Druid is the least played, least understood class, and one of the most fun
---
Ayo tell my brother kriswow to start streaming again, thanks.
---
Riiigghhtttt
---
I think that's my mistake too. I tried doing like 3 pulls only last night. I guess I need to take it slow.  
---
That's a lot of gold man! Oof. Hope I can farm that much gold too.
---
My health is around 2.9K and my mana is at 6k with AI. I think that will do. Right? :D
---
He's not saying anything about gear. However, you shouldn't show up to a raid unprepared. You watch videos, read about mechanics etc. Why should it be different for a dungeon. As a tank you are the one that's supposed to be setting the pace and making the pulls. So, you should take the responsibility to learn the layout, mob mechanics etc so you aren't holding everyone up or wiping them. As a mage, before I go into a dungeon I look up bosses and dungeon mechanics to know which mobs I should be seeping, CS, and other abilities that are a part of my class. Don't be lazy.
---
Looks empty
---
You'd be much better off buying those flasks every week to get used to it and saving them for later content when they're warrented....
---
And the fact you can understand the people talking in /s around you.
---
Yeah, screw that guy that shows up to every raid spending 100+g every raid night on consumables to help the team.  Entitled aholes if you ask me.
---
I suppose that depends on what you value in life now doesn't it? Please enlighten me as to why my life in the states is just so empty compared to these other wonderful nations.
---
Hello how do I play game pls? Thx
---
Your post just agrees with me. The majority of people will be dropping them when BGs hit. So smart people will be doing it at other times. The price will be driven down if you do it at BG launch.
---
Its stupid to think WoW pve got any different , always a piece  of cake.
---
You can only have one of each totem type, but they all "stack" if you're placing different totems from each other.

Nice thanks!

If anyone does not believe me, or if you have been curious of transferring, make a Level 1 toon, and check for yourself!
---
The definition of casual varies based on the activity you are applying it to.
---
thats why we should be reserving judgement until we have the full context.
---
Oh man I was ready. Ya got me.
---
That's true, but I think it's also the fact that when they released world pvp before there were maybe 1/100th of the people playing now, and since nobody had wowhead or online leveling guides, a lower fraction of them were actually at 60, and the ones that were were still trying to figure out the 60 instances. Now everyone knows everything, so when world PVP came out they're bored, like you said.
---
How can you honestly say the game is dead lmao
---
The picture I took DOES NOT do Orgrimmar justice. I couldn't find the right angle to screenshot. It's much better than this.
---
He makes easily over 1 million dollars a year.  The "stress" he feels is probably lower than that of a minimum wage worker.
---
I have no sympathy for him, he's really done it to himself.
---
dude i will make suggestions all day long for a newbie and if you pay attention and listen i promise you we will come out of this dungeon with a W, its the fuckers that repeatedly try a strategy that you told them not to after we wiped to it, who refuse to pull mobs that are in danger of getting pulled after being asked *AND* also is a shitty tank that make me have a stroke.
---
I play Heartseeker Alliance, btw.
---
Is there an alliance version? On mobile so may be missing it
---
Is this any better than Bagnon?
---
It was probably tuned differently but people from pservers talk about naxx still taking quite a bit of work now.
---
Either get in dungeons or slowly grind the mobs in silithus. Thats how I made the last few levels right after P2 dropped. I still died in Silithus but it was literally impossible for me to gain exp in ungoro, epl, wpl, or winterspring. It sucks but that's just the way it is. Later you will be able to brag about how you leveled up through P2
---
o7
---
reporting for duty
---
and then realize its barely changed and return to dungeon grinding
---
TP/MV? I guess thorium point aaand... Morgan's village or something? &lt;-- Horde.
---
Probably a macro to switch to Battle Stance and Charge, with Charge being on the same key in Battle Stance - same thing I do.
---
Intercept is probably on the same key with an equivalent macro for other stances, just as well.
---
Should be plenty! Just always have your mana ruby conjured and you shouldn’t have mana problems. 
---
Try out some smaller pulls until you feel comfortable and add graves as you get the hang of it. Don’t be afraid to fountain reset if you feel a pull go sideways. 
---
You’ll have epic mount in no time :)

Can we stop seeing post like these? Like who gives a fuck about a lvl 19 geared rogue killing scrubs. This shit was wack as fuck to watch. And you’re not good at the game.
---
Battlegrounds. With the insane faction imbalance, alliance will have pretty much instant queues while horde players will have to wait 20-30 min in order to have a BG pop.
---
I HoT them and tell them to tap it out. Do they tap it out? No. 
---
}:-(
---
Not a druid, but when levelling my Shaman I did not buy a mount at 40 and used Ghost Wolf all the way to 60 until I could afford my epic mount.
---
In my eyes, the 20% movement speed increase over Ghost Wolf/Travel Form is not worth 90 gold.
---
But the only way he could be doing this is if they were freshly dinged, no other possible way man *\end sarcasm
---
Servers are over populated, horde is dominant faction whereas in vanilla it was slightly ally favoured, we are in a period that only lasted 2 months during vanilla (honor is active but BGs arent), more people know what they are doing now.
---
Hold off for a couple more weeks imo, see what happens when BGs come out.

On Alliance Side Pagle and I agree. For every tryhard guild there two or three guilds that are clearing all content every week just joking around with the boys
---

---
Its funny when playing a tank and the smoothest pulls in the dungeon are when the dps have to drink for the first few moments of the pull.
---
Pulls go so much snoother when youre not fighting over aggro 1.5s into the pull.
---
40
---
you could xfer back and forth between US realms and OCE realms back in TBC, in fact back then the OCE realms were literally hosted in US West. the only thing that made those servers "oceanic" was the ingame clock
---
I play on the Alliance side btw!
---
Any Horde guilds who are NOT sure about transferring, now is the time!

I would say its on the lucky side but not too much

Get fiery weapon and upgrade your weapon when you feel like it, maybe every 10~ lvls or whenever you get a good one
---
My mana pool is over 2x the amount of mana the best water I can drink replenishes.
---
^this
---
That is the rarest thing I have ever heard of happening in WoW.
---
Did this really need a 2nd post? Heartseeker Alliance here. Don't let this guy scam you. Horde get absolutely fisted no matter where they go by roaming packs of alliance. If you want to join this server, build up a guild coalition and get multiple to transfer otherwise you'll just be miserable.
---
Ah that makes sense, maybe wpvp wont be so bad for those players on pvp servers when it comes out then.
---
This guy has it. Ignore the others.
---
Yeh I bet you are clearing AOTC mythic end bosses every raid!

---
Why play a pvp server if the only reason you pvp is for the honor rewards?

Because content is hard.

By this you mean I should wait until I get thrashblade before I put crusader on my weapon?
---
How did your level 1 character spawn there

That's gonna be everyday for me next semester...... Ugh

Says the ignorant warrior lol
---
Yeah, fiery weapon wasn’t too expensive.
---
You don’t need more than 21 in Resto to Main heal any dungeon content. Obv Resto will do it better, but with a decent set of blue gear and a mana pot (just in case) you shouldn’t have trouble. I’ve main healed every dungeon with the 30/0/21 ele/Resto spec.
---
They already did that with my self respect though
---
This isn’t always the case. I had a tank who knew nothing of the dungeon and I the healer had run it 6 times already. I tried to get them to follow me. I would say in chat “this way” and they would go and pull something somewhere else. I get that your a tank and you usually take the lead but if you have never run the dungeon maybe just take a backseat.

every azuregos battle ive been to has been very smooth with hundreds on screen. idk i cant tell if you people are full of shit or what.
---
There's a couple of very easy bosses in Naxx.
---
I’ve been talking to the Horde side and multiple guilds have already transferred and many more are still coming.
---
Is Heartseeker imbalanced? Yes!
---
Is it probably 65:35 or 70:30 in Alliance favor? Yes!
---
But, it is A LOT better than it ever was in the past.
---
As a fellow Alliance, I’m not quite sure why you would be trying to discourage horde to join here?
---
Trolls 2019 at their best ^^
---
Where do you get that set?
---
I transfered from Stalagg to HS on the latest transfer wave. Couple info about me/my guild. I'm a pretty much fully MC geared warlock, our fastest clear of MC was 1:04 back on Stalagg, but we usually go 1:30 without buffs and half in PvP spec.
---
Economy: HS economy is a lot slower than Stalagg, big epic and slow moving items will take a while to sells, but common trade goods like herb, cloth, enchant mats usually sell within 24h.
---
Dungeons and instances: I can't really say, I don't pug.
---
PvP: This is a tricky one, you'll need to get a feel for the zones to know where to go depending on your group size. I've got a couple nice solo spot that I won't share, but you'll find some calmer zone if you look. As a rogue it's not as bad as for other classes since you decide when to engage. Just keep in mind the alliance loves to call in overwhelming numbers ASAP. If you engage 1 or 2, expect 15 other allies to land on you in 2-3 min. Kill quick, move out. If you spot an alliance raid roaming the zone, you move to another zone. That's the advantage you have as the underdog faction. THEY are everywhere, YOU are not. If you leave, their big ass 40 man raid starves.
---
All in all, HS could use some more horde to balance it out, but even as it is now, it's 100x better than Stalagg ever was. I'll take being overrun than not having any PvP at all anyday.
---
Just ask yourself what kind of player you are. Do you play your games on Hard or Easy? Because every single Alliance player in here chose Easy, while every horde player chose Hard.
---
Track humanoid on with hunter pet attack macro with my name on it. Tell me how to get away from that genius.
---
Tbh any class with a 100% mount and half a brain can indefinitely camp anyone without a 100% speed mount.
---
HealComm has existed since day 1 and works with default frames.
---
The tooltip doesnt say it helps frostbolt either.  Also from my experience even with a Jed ID its hard to get any casters for rend runs.  The trinket drops often enough that anybody who really cared about it has it.
---
Ive got a pretty bad honor bug today too.
---
Yesterday I had about 95 HKs, but I logged in today at about 10am EST, PvPd a bit, got about 30 more kills until about 3pm. I logged in at 7pm and Yesterdays honor updated, except, none of Yesterdays honor is included, only the ones I had gotten earlier today, so it only shows 34 kills for "Yesterday" (even though those were the kills from today). The 95ish kills I actually got on Saturday are gone, I remember having around 7.4k honor and 130ish kills "This Week" before it updated and now its updated with only adding "Yesterday" values, ie. Im at 9.8k and 164 kills "This Week" now.
---
I dont think its time relevent, I think its just generally bugged up the ass. Im hopeful that this is just a display bug and not an entire days worth of honor being deleted, because if so, thats huge amount of time completely wasted on nothing. Those 95 HKs werent in a group and they were almost all between 50-200 honor each, thats 5k+ honor down the drain
---
You can AoE grind and PvP very effectively with a typical 17-0-34 spec. Only need to change once a week for raids and back. Farming ZF at 12-14min a run with zombies and scarabs yields about 60g/hr, definitely more time efficient than leveling a character solely for money making.
---
Fellow RetBull here! Having a lot more fun in classic auto attacking than I ever dreamed I would!
---
This man speaks truth.
---
I HoT locks all the time when they're half mana and I'm just drinking for the next pull and they sit there like an idiot 90% of the time.
---
And I'm over here being told I'll never be able to do anything playing a kitty druid. Pfft.
---
I firmly believe Druids are the best second or third tank in a raid. The usefulness of having a Brez, innervate, and de-curser in an off tank is just so valuable.  Definitely think it’s worth it over a fury/Prot Warrior
---
The southern entrance is just a no-go. You're fine standing at other places, but there's some pretty huge gaps in the guard coverage in that area. There's only like 1 or 2 guards that occasionally patrol there, and the nearby NPC's don't call for assistance.
---
Do yourself a favor and just never go there. Just use the northern entrance when leaving and circle around.
---
This was my biggest thing leveling classic.  I finally decided to play a dedicated dps class.  Seems like a lot of people decided to play tanks for the first time.  Leveling involved me teaching many people pulls and even basic tanking tips.  Like LoS, which mobs to prio and sometimes just let the hunter who is ignoring marks tank a mob with his pet or face.  I had a lot of very good interactions with new tanks and only a few that rejected the idea of me marking and leading the group.  Was a fun time!  Don't be afraid to ask Or offer advice in a polite way.
---
It is
---
I should manage that with my hunter! Thanks!
---
Deviate Delight ally has serious mental problems.
---
Leveling has become an awful experience and many of my friends already quit. Im 52 atm and getting killed over and over everywhere I go. Im pissed, this sucks.
---
Oh no. Two ganks...
---
No need to be a prick. OP might not be the most eloquent but he is obviously pissed. Just cos you got lucky and picked a good server doesn't mean everyone did. If the situation is that bad they should merge realms or open free transfer away with the intention of shutting it down. Maybe if you were in this situation you would be more sympathetic rather than comment like a complete asshat.
---
Y and he said he and his 10 guilds will own server lol..Got one world boss lost all others
---
Ask the dwarf rouge that killed me 19 times in hillsbrad
---
Quit the game so the population drops and the lag improves for the rest of us
---
My guild was in a similar situation. Transferred from stalagg horde to heartseeker right before the first reset of phase 2.
---
As others have said if you aren’t against being the underdog it is definitely something to consider. I will say I’ve had some of the most fun and frustrating experiences due to the imbalance. If you take a flight path alone to pretty much and high level zone expect to be killed by 3-5 people the second you land. This includes orgrimmar if you are flagged for PvP. However I’ve had a blast rolling as a group of 5-10 guildies getting into small skirmishes. But you are basically reliant on hit and run tactics, if you stay in one place too long you will get our numbered. It’s also been a blast rolling into BRM or Ony as a full raid and wiping alliance raids that got to comfortable sitting around picking off small groups.
---
Overall I’d say if you are ok with being the underdog and putting up with some frustrating times when alone and have or able to find a coordinate group to run around with it’s definitely a viable option if you are sick of stalagg. If you plan on trying to go solo I would not recommend it in the slightest. Granted I’m a lock and you might have it easier as a rogue.
---
PvE wise it’s basically what other people said difficult to get to instanced unless coordinated and harder to find groups. All of which can be alleviated by finding a good guild.
---
The beginning of the end of classic...
---
Yeah he gave me some gold and is helping me farm. I just feel like the process is sooo slow :’( lol
---
Shamans and Paladins are the classes that get shit on the most for their lack of _____. But when a Warrior windfuires or has Salvation they don’t seem to get how useful it really is
---
Lame
---
Yeah painful stuff.  I try to help less experienced tanks by marking the appropriate targets for them.  It's amazing how much smoother the run will go.
---
Some people keep parroting the same things over and over again, they have hard time understanding how hard some servers are on lockdown. To some people the game is currently Pay to Not Play as there's very few things they can do.  
---
P1 despite balance issues was great, there was skirmishes and some occasionaly camping but you could always do things out in the world after a while or reach dungeon with few deaths. Now even AH prices are completely messed up to the underdog factions of their servers, since it's next to impossible to even touch any nodes without getting killed and your target taken by someone else.
---
because they kill you and go back to FP. it doesnt make sense for them to follow you and only you as you spawn further and further away. GeNiUS
---
I’m alliance so that won’t work. Thanks though!
---
My favorite is when hunters multishot immediately.
---
Pserver naxx isn't the same as vanilla. They made it harder cause it was too easy.
---
I am horde, so do you mean the piece of rabbit fur? https://youtu.be/mHIbILw654Y
---
This is it, in its entirety.  Brands don’t think that you see a commercial and immediately go buy the product (well, smart brands anyway). They just wanna inundate you with the knowledge that they exist, so that if and when you need the product they specialize in, their brand jumps to mind. It’s a long game for the advertisers now.
---
Hey thanks! Yeah I’ve heard fishing is a good way, might give that a go
---
Not sure if trolling here.  just click the VoD
---
You know what I hate is the people that try to skip groups here and there so they can save five minutes, seriously those two guys over there aren't hard to kill alone but when you ass pull them while we are fighting the next group cause you aren't paying attention they probably are gonna cost us more then five minutes with the corpse run.
---
Right so the guy camping me today for 40 mins doing this didnt actually do it. Righto. You should prob get a job that takes up a bit more of your time. This isn't healthy.
---
Yeah I know it will be at least a few levels before I have enough, it’s just so frustrating ha. Thanks for the tips!
---
Hey now, no need to be mean.
---
Scrap to get rid of all the vendor trash
---
Grrcat.
---
Lol at the belly achers in this thread complaining at any little things they can find. “This isn’t one shotting blah blah” it’s still cool as all hell
---
&gt; It absolutely effects damage meters and threat meters which read the combat log.
---
Yeh damn. I guess mostly in situations where you have max range characters standing on opposite sides of a boss?
---
I remote in. when I log in the morning there is no queue
---
Says an alliance, still working on getting those ribs removed?
---
It was only bad the first 2 days. We have had multiple huge fights without a single lag since then.
---
he might know you as a douchebag and is purposefully camping you
---
on some servers you dont even want to be in the town
---
&gt; he's really done it to himself.
---
not really. partly yes, but the level of retardation from the anti asmon crowds is off the fucking charts. just watch that dude advertise sp's stream. all of that type should be on FBI watch list tbh
---
Grrccat
---
You tryna bang?
---
On what server ?
---
I'm having a hard time believing they wouldn't have more fun in dungeons. Good luck doing any kind of questing in 50+ areas as Alliance. It might work if you log on at 5 am.
---
I think people need to re-align on the definition of "one-shot"
---
Just trying to get clarification because first the pet will find you in stealth but then you said "if people are chasing you but a pet is in you" which is different then your first statement. You just need to explain things better because you are jumping points
---
Which i literally pointed out in the post you are responding too...
---
I'm starting to understand better why the local tanks and healers don't want to know you.
---
I'm sure WeakAuras is your best bet
---
"You cant be camped more than once or twice"
---
"Well you can but noone is going to do it"
---
"Well they might but you deserved it"
---
Damn
---
buffs sure. but you can only do it once a week. you can't really 'fish' for rng.
---
More so referring to the fact that they’re making 49 twinks.  That’s a lot of effort for a toon so close to 60.
---
Yeh, basically boils down to ‘if you want to do literally anything besides gank the occasional person out in the world, don’t transfer’
---
What’s worse is you will still have massive BG queues and be dominated by alliance out in the world. It’s the worst of both worlds.
---
My go to line, "Ok it's been 11 years since i have done this dungeon, can someone be marking the next pull and i will go that way" 
---
Mostly has worked out haha.
---
I am enjoying myself thanks!
---
Should I worry about getting an epic mount first or a Lionheart Helm as a warrior? I am 4 arcanite bars + fee away from the helmet but I’m wondering if I should sell the mats for a mount
---
Do you still feel that intense grip when you come to terms with the fact that it was your own fault? That insane squish...
---
Hah, I officer'd for a similar 'invite anyone with living pulse' guild on our server but we try to keep only the nice peeps. The infamous  guild, on Alliance anyway, is called &lt;High Quality&gt; which is GM'd by literally a 30 year old man who never aged past 13.

Their members are well known for fucking up, including:
---
1) Raid locking an MC pug because they were already raided (and being rather unapologetic about it)
---
2) Disconnecting often 
---
3) Being pretty incompetent, getting stuck on Garr for 3 weeks
---
Yea. There is no reason to farm at lvl 40. Everything is cheaper and you are literally wasting time that you can put into getting level 60 where all expensive items are.  Just get lvl 60 because you are wasting time and getting less worth for your time. If you only have 40 gold at lvl 40 is kinda bad. Just from passive income in terms of skilling my profession you gain 100 gold. Just dungeon grind imo or if you want to farm either herbs/mining and do that for some day and sell for profit. It doesn't get harder than that. I would say just dungeon-grind :P. Easiest way to gain gold
---
Dating Miss Michigan
---
I've never played on a server where that was the case. Alliance always dominate thorium point, its their closest FP
---
Imagine not logging out like a good little pleb and making a whiny edited video post about it to show everyone that you’re personal expectations aren’t being met
---
I’ve been watching off and on, and all he does on stream is complain about the game so it’s largely the same as Twitter. 
---
It must be hard having the success of one game developer’s intellectual property completely dictate his life. Without WoW, his stream will eventually die off. 
---
I wonder how he will pivot his career with no company willing to stick their neck out for someone with such proof of toxicity. I mean, Sodapoppin is still facing some problems with obtaining sponsorships due to his younger days. Then there’s Asmon on another level...
---
I will only take one guess as to what all the neckbeards will be doing while waiting for their queue.
---
Imagine caring what some random dickhead does in this game
---
I reset it (Tools &gt; Reset &gt; Buff Watch) at the beginning of every session and it seems to work fine for priest buffs. 
---
My only wishlist item would be keeping fear ward on more than 1 target.
---
Not on PvP servers for sure.
---
People are fixated on leveling as fast as possible? It's a bit late for that...
---
Daggers are actually simming higher than swords at the moment. The downside being that it's basically impossible to pug any dungeon once you get a good dagger because you'll pull off of the tank constantly and gimp your dps. You also have to switch back to swords if you want to farm.
---
I just reluctantly got a perditions because swords don't drop for my guild and while it's nice seeing a constant stream of backstab crits, it sucks being essentially crippled in non raid content.
---
Great for pvp though, 2 shitting mages doesn't get old.
---
UI?
---
At least 40% of warlocks that I've healed so far: *cast life tap until 1/3 hp, then start casting hellfire*
---
That makes no sense.  If you use TE and you have no target, and you just said that it would grab the nearest, then clearing your target would grab the same enemy.  So if you don't clear it, and you hit it again, it will cycle to the next one.  So like I said in the first place, don't clear the target.
---
At least it's not hearthstone. I would feel sorry for Kripp if he didn't have millions of dollars
---
He said his stream content. He'll still play classic, just off-stream. He'll also come back every content patch, like BGS/BWL and so on.    
---
    
---
Classic has a content drought issue and WPvP is uninteresting to watch, especially if you're a streamer who gets streamsniped all the time. Putting a delay means less chat intereaction which is also detrimental to stream content, viewers dont like it when you dont interact with them.       
---
   
---
He has 30k+ people to keep entertained, he obviously cant farm gold or sit in theramore for 8hrs+/day like a 500 viewer andy. None of that stuff is interesting to watch.
---
I play on Stonespine and believe me they do camp the boats, Thorium Point and Morgan’s Vigil. Constantly. Try getting in to a Blackrock Mountain instance from any flight path in fewer than 5 corpse runs.
---
It can be resisted by other enemies (dire maul elementals) so I'd be surprised if this was the reason
---
All to advance characters everyone's tired of and hates.
---
30/0/21 and spam CH in raid mate, that's your ticket in.
---
People are both the best and worst part of online games.
---
Depends strongly on when you play and who you play with.
---
This is compatible with healcomm? I mean users of one will see heals of the other?
---
Agreed
---
No offense but I’m not sure why me asking how to make gold efficiently has everyone thinking I’m going to stop leveling? I’m just asking if there is something I can be doing to get my mount as soon as possible. I am still questing/doing dungeons/practicing skills and leveling, just doesn’t seem like I’m making much.
---
Depends on your priorities. If you want to pvp then mount. If you make money with something in the world, then probably mount.
---
If you are just doing dungeons and raids, then obviously gear is way better.
---
I like when you try to help obviously new tanks by giving them easy strats for bosses and they say "Trust me bud I've been tanking for 15 years" or some other lie along those lines
---
Thats not true at all. I play pvp and have had many cool interactions with other players not all of them the same factions as me as well.
---
You will easily get the runecloth/gold required to earn exalted while doing this.
---
Rank 1 takes 15HK. You mean rank 14
---
At your current rate I'd wager about 8 days played to 60.
---
To be fair, this is the top server in EU.
---
&gt;If you're at 100% health ~~and less than 100% mana with a hot on you,~~ you're doing it wrong.
---
FTFY
---
Oh the irony in this comment.
---
Oh stop
---
Great post!  I concur. I am a prot warrior tank and can be the tour guide on most dungeons. When I say I don’t know Strat live, just be cool and step up.  Don’t cry and moan about how I don’t do a bigger job than I am already doing.
---
Yeah the game is incredibly biased against casters.  level 19 rogue can easily gank a level 30 warlock because melee miss chance is so much lower.  Meanwhile, a level 19 caster vs a level 30 melee is going to get fucked because 99% of their casts will be resisted.
---
Dire mail has been the worst. First time around I was obsessed with T0 gear (though to be fair, I think shadowcraft is one of the better sets). I think I ran each wing once, got my FR trinket, and never went back. It the only dungeon that I just have no clue about, and by the time I hit 60 everyone had been farming it for 3 weeks. My first few groups were a clusterfuck.
---
Do you have skinning? When I was 40 as a rogue, I went grinding for Thick Leather.
---
Also just quest, that will give you 90 gold from 40-44
---
Well, bye
---
this thread gonna get so attacked lol
---
Try warlocks.
---
Listing your server and faction would be helpful.
---
What if WoW TBC VR comes out just after we pass on ?
---
Oh nah he was just saying how big the journey has been for him grinding Winterspring reputation so I was just making sure he was already a Night Elf or had already done the original Darnassus exaltation grind beforehand...because on the rare chance that he hadnt, he was going to be in for a rude shock
---
Np
---
Psa to healers manage your mana better let the lock die
---
You need to get a hunter friend, too much waiting. My method:
---
1) Kill dickbag Lowbie
---
2) immediately dismiss pet
---
3) run behind nearby environmental object feign death
---
4) allclear.jpg
---
5) idiot lowbie thinks they're safe, rez, 
---
6) run out kill lowbie hide behind something else.
---
Best part about this is eventually when you leave they'll spend forever trying to figure out if your still there or not.
---
Yes it does. Spell power rogue is a thing in naxx iirc. A meme, but a thing nonetheless
---
Okay - I’m sculpted like Dwayne the Rock Johnson after one day. 
---
What’s the plan now?
---
No, no put it on the level 15 weapon
---
Never knew that, cool.  Thanks.
---
Hmmm. Interesting, but it would be nice to have my classic characters funds backing my TBC experience. A tbc server starting fresh at level 1 would have a super strange economy where people gotta get their level 40 mounts again but no one needs anything on the AH from level 1-60
---
Just because something makes you feel bad doesnt make it elitist. 
---
People want to play with others who are on their level. They dont want to carry half the raid. That's not elitist.
---
So you can use your brain now but not before you posted the first time?
---
Re-roll pve server if it gets to the point where you're dreading logging in
---
Well it’s bound to get boring fast if you got an army of fanboys doing half your shit for ya.
---
I have had 20+ and it's been great
---
Are you playing on RP realm
---
Okay? Boomer?
---
I was about to say this. On Mograine neither faction cares about the gurads. Sometimes its just a bloodbath with players, guards, gryphons and wyverns
---
cant get your epic mount at 50 friend
---
This is how Azuregos was in Vanilla.

This highlights an easy way to get good starting agro for two reasons:
---
You regrowth yourself (and rejuv if you want). This adds some agro to mobs, but it also saves a heal from your healer, giving you the little bit less threat needed.
---
If a melee dps takes agro, let him keep it. He will learn soon.
---
If a ranged takes it, call them out, because if they drop that threat or lose it, it goes after the healer next.
---
Do you have your lock picking up all the way?

No, every healer complains about locks that stand there after a pull with 10% health and watch you drink while not eating.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
This made me pause. Now I cant stop trying to remember what phone I had back then.  I'm concerned it may have still been the BlackBerry Torch.
---
I'm a feral druid that tanks, but I also have a learning disability that makes it difficult for me to navigate properly. I still get lost in RFC. I find that if I just politely mention that I'll likely get lost, usually someone will happily point me in the right direction.
---
Just complain enough and they'll be open in 2 weeks.
---
Yeah. I am playing ff14 right now and I hate the world there. The story is great but I don't see anything from the world because I am porting all over the place. And the mobs are no threat eather if I had to run for a few meters. 
---
The classic wow experience is much better with the walking and no flying. I hate flying and porting in MMORPGs.
---
I pickpocket ALOT of drugs. Lots of snuff (not only pirates, the humans in plate armor at Tyr’s hand too!). Lots of pipes. And I get lockers from the same adds, and they keep deathWeed in them!
---
I have also looted a lock picking book that requires 5000 lock picking skill and a Book of How To Cook Man or something from giants.
---
Weird things tho? The idea that all gear is somehow Huntard gear, shadow priests come to MC (no room on debuffs for SWpain and flay), somehow arms warriors are allowed in mc (less dps than tanks) and some healers get pissy about warlocks using lifetap.
---
Username checks out
---
If you can mine/tank, may I recommend, finding some guild mates to do DM:E jump runs. You can make crazy good gold per hour mining all the thorium. Also an enchanter to disenchant all the drops nobody needs. Its truly insane how much g per hour you can make with a good group that rezzes each thing.
---
There's no fast gold farming at that level. Quest and grind mobs, find mobs that drop decent vendor trash and grind those then sell everything
---
I actually started leveling on faerlina when Advertise made the video about the horde’s state. I think it was a 30-70 ratio horde to alliance, alliance being favoured. Seemed like a fun little challenge with a lot of pvp. Also wanted to help Advertise shut Asmon’s entitled mouth. 
---
Now here I am playing horde with 70-30 ratio horde being favoured. Don’t know how that happened over a couple of months but it did. It’s a lot of fun tbh but I can also see why Asmon hates it since they went from otter dominance to only being able to go anywhere if the horde lets them. 
---
While I did sign up for a lost battle when I rolled on that server. Asmon rolled so he can dominate the server with little to no effort. But when it came to him being outplayed in pvp constantly even tho he obviously had better gear it hurt his ego so much he had two choices either swap realms or go back to retail.
---
 When one of his guildies attacked advertise with the hand of Ragnaros while he (as a shadow priest had no mana) and starter losing the fight against a mana less priest Asmon gold stated “why would he attack him he was afk” as in referring to his guildie getting attacked while he initiated the fight. You have to be extremely delusional to say that imo. 
---
Poor Asmon been told by his chat he is correct in every scenario that he is starting to believe it. 
---
Also if you encourage stream sniping on the alliance side as in “msg me inv to form a 100 man raid group so we can kill that 20 horde players at brm”, you deserve to be sniped from horde side as well. That’s just my genuine opinion.
---
It's really hard to say, I've gone literally 20 runs without a crystal and also gotten 3 in one run
---
I'd say the average is probably 1-2 crystals per lockout
---
Also dont be that lock that doesnt bother to bring your own bandages/pots to heal your self.
---
Fairbanks isn’t anywhere near 55/45. It’s more like 70/30 or at the absolute best 65/35.
---
That said, Fairbanks is a large server and even the alliance side has tons of groups and dungeons. Just have fun corpse walking (7-10x) if you want to do any of the higher level ones.
---
It will have walked off on its own until then.
---
Lol that‘s sick!
---
Is there any resources that list good quest rewards/dungeon drops for each class as a helpful guide while leveling? 
---
There’s a lot of good stuff that could make leveling easier but potentially easy to miss just because you don’t know it’s there.
---
You should be good. I ranked it at 56 on my Druid. Was a lil rough but doable.
---
Shadow priest is always gonna my least fav group member. They always pull agro. Mind blast is stupid
---
OP is asking when is the best time to sell it, at no point did I say I am ahead of the curve or act like my post was revolutionary. 
---
Yes most people already know what I said but clearly OP didn't if he is asking the question.
---
Not sure why you felt the need to comment other than you being a piece of shit human.
---
Sad how so many people get pissed over this when it’s super obvious it was not ninja looted
---
horde will gank lowbies in between queues, so nothing will change for alliance.
---
More hunters should give their pets the same name as themselves, it messes up /target macros (and incidentally spy).
---
It is the annoying part is when I am paying attention to the mana and I forget to wait one time. For some reason the healer has to remind me every fucking time.
---
If you're using EA on a crippling poison with a rogue right next to you, you've got to start considering whether all the good players are wrong, or if you're just... bad (no offense, most people are bad ♥)
---
how will specifically target lowbies while waiting for queue
---
I love that cookbook, doing the turkey this coming week!
---
Im not bitching, im telling you as it is. I unsubbed after being corpse camped several days in a row. I've spent countless hours spamming chat asking for help, i tried to rally other randoms. But no matter the effort, there was just too much horde. Alliance started to leave. Now its dead. So I unsubbed, as I dont want to play a game with mechanics this broken.
---
What's so good about the alliance on herod exactly? Heard alot about how they can fight
---
No fires in SW. How do the residents keep warm at night?
---
I don't think it's going to be possible to group queue for AV, but you can be sure people will work around this either through mods or just coordinated queueing.
---
Not true, always alliance to kill on the boat at menethil or just grief in BRM
---
Find one of the horde that has a significant other and make your move
---
Lol so happy to be on a PvE server. People sure like to complain about PvP on a PvP server
---
Keep it. Flurry Axe with fiery blaze is your best weapon for AoE farming. Get a Skullflame Shield to go with it if you can find one.
---
I  have a copy myself and I quite enjoy it. I also have the Walking Dead cookbook too!
---
You're a real one. Thank you.
---
- a deep prot tank who raided in TBC but has never seen MC
---
Ive ran UBRSs well over 30 times (lost count around 31 and just kept running for hours).
---
Ive paid for keys, payed a tank to reserve them, had guild runs.
---
They do not exist, do not lie to me.
---
Offering 200 g per sword on alliance heart-seeker.
---
i get plenty of hks at 12-4 PST. they may not calculate right on time but they show up a day late at most.
---
I tried - but all I could find was men living with their mothers. 
---
Do we take them as secondary prizes?
---
Luna unit frames is almost identical aesthetically and has built in heal prediction.
---
I'm an arms warrior with Mortal Strike (though only level 44) and I have no idea what this means.
---
Did you read my post? I'm saying those hordies who come to IF are doing the right thing.
---
Most expensive 350dps raid member! Lol... Our worst afk melee does 750dps on bosses 🤣gratz though?
---
Does this require other healers to have this installed in order to see their incoming heals?
---
also true
---
Can confirm, I dinged 48 on my hunter the day before phase 2 launched with ~ 4 days played and I was excited to beat my warrior's leveling /played of 7 days 9 hours.  Today I hit my warrior's /played right around the time I dinged 57.
---
[Yup](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/alliance-leveling-classic-wow) 
---
They have a horde version as well. It gives recommended zones for leveling as well as unique/substantial quest rewards within those zones
---
Check if they feign right after. If they do they're doing the rotation for optimal Hunter DPS.
---
I did ony attunement fine? Just corpse run 4 times
---
Thanks I’ll look into it.
---
I have so many amazing stories from the people I’ve met online during Classic, especially since phase 2 has come out on a PvP server.
---
Make a macro for Yelling Lockpicking and most people will tip you. So get that maxed out if yiu want extra gold. Im a mage and can make like 20g an hour sitting in Org.
---
A cup is 8 ounces for reference, in case you didn't know. Usually by volume for the cookbooks, not to be confused with ounces for weight.
---
I always recommend the epic mount, it will make a more noticeable difference than the helm will
---
Nah people should quit, classic is now retail 2.0 and blizzard couldnt care less.
---
I didn’t think Gehennas was an RP server. Kinda cool that this happened spontaneously!
---
To add on to your advice, warlocks should also be tapping if they're not in immediate danger of dying by doing so and something is happening to prevent them from Shadowbolting/etc. I've seen a lot of warlocks on the rag fight get bounced back, be at plenty of health, and just waste that GCD they spend running back to position.
---
More than likely you're internet service. Are you on NBN FTTN?
---
Wait thats it! become their new daddy and cancel their WoW. Make em shove a remote up their asses as a bonus
---
In case someone hasn't observed this...part of the problem is that many dps/healers don't actually know the encounters as well as the tanks do...so they expect you to know everything, but many couldn't explain their way out of the paper bag encounter.
---
20man raid rolled him off the server LUL i guess it was hard to defeat with 1k guildies
---
I like how you dont mention anything about frost bolt. But keep thinking that removing a snare is more valuable than removing CC from one of the strongest dps and one of the strongest healers lmao
---
Usually happens, when people are bullied or feel impotent IRL and they realise they have some small measure of power in some small obsure manner, they have to take it to extremes. 
---
Very similar to forum moderators.
---
Gotta be honest.  Logged on to Retail for first time in months.    
---
Doing the AV power level for some toons 
---
Then during went and replicated similar to this.  As that way classic and retail look same for me  :)
---
Perfection.
---
This is a good one!
---
We're talking about the scenario where everyone is OOM, healer has to drink before even being able to heal the lock, but the lock is still standing there, watching the healer drink and not eating/drinking themselves.  It's not super common thankfully (especially as the healer gears up and doesn't go OOM often), but it's rage inducing when it happens.
---
OGAR MAKA !!!
---
It's the gut ripper, and for the mh bloodrazor. Can't use them yet cus I'm lvl 32 :'(
---
Retail players and their speed run meta have been a pox on the game since launch. It's been gratifying to watch them zoom and fail, and then slow down and listen. Let's not even start on their toxic feature demands on the forums.
---
Sorry, not sorry.
---
you salty allies just go into every thread to inject your saltiness?
---
And said "I'm getting on my main because this is unfair".
---
[https://i.imgur.com/BVWALNt.png](https://i.imgur.com/BVWALNt.png)
---
  
---
If healmeter doesn't look like this after the instance, you went too easy.
---
no they are not. World buffs have another set.
---
Joke is on OP, horde have no girlfriends
---
Fancy was my Motorola razr, baby. Loved that thing!
---
It’s not something you have to worry about until you get into raids!
---
There’s a debuff limit of 16 on enemies. So Curse of Elements uses one, Sunder Armor another, Hunters Mark, etc.
---
Those examples are all debuffs that are desirable since they benefit the players dmg as well as others in the raid. 
---
The one that Mortal Strike applies is a -50% healing which won’t do dmg on it’s own or benefit other players. It effectively “steals” a slot from something that would be more helpful for the entire raid.
---
Now having said that, it honestly does not matter. Our guild initially cleared MC with two Shadow Priests and an Arms warrior. We are now at the point where we are just trying to see how fast we can kill everything so we are being stricter regarding what debuffs people apply.
---
i’m on thunderfury too! what is the server sub?
---
The ammount of time they have playing all slack jawed I'm gonna say about 76.3% (repeating of course) of them do not have girl friends. But I'll take IRL gains over minimal honor gains
---
No private server you can jump on and see?
---
There is absolutely no way it's 70/30. I'd but 60/40 for sure though.
---
This is my strategy. Starting around gnomer and ulda, I would make sure I first ran it as dps before tanking it myself
---
Yes.
---
You might be right in this case, I don't know, but friendly reminder that wowhead can be *really* inaccurate when the mobs in question frequently don't drop anything at all.
---
That or I just had some absolute garbage luck farming elemental earth...
---
No shame in speaking up and telling them to wait for your mana, especially when running with rogues and warriors who don't know what mana is.
---
I’m gonna need you to take off about 20% there
---
This is not how things work. There are plenty of us retail players who could run circles around the majority of the PvE content classic has to offer. We do not share a hivemind. You need to get out of this mentality of "us vs. them", it is really stupid.
---
Love unexpected Letterkenny references lol
---
Just a few remarks. You're doing great. Tanking in classic is just a shitshow no matter what so don't take it personal. And if you pull out all the stops, pre-hot, enrage, tab maul, rage dump with swipe, than the fault is on your dps, many which have cools or skills to tank single elites or non- elites to some fashion for a limites period of time. One last thing, is sometimes the key to tanking large groups is actually knowing when to let go, in some cases you will be faced with the decision, "Do I tank 2-3 mobs effectively or do I tank 4-5 mobs poorly?". Sometimes the answer isn't simple, but you will learn certain dungeons and know which ones have weak melee dmg or deal spell dmg which you really have no mitigation for anyways. Hope this helps. Good luck out there.
---
Can you do a kvaldir saying “I’LL EAT YOUR HEART!!!”?  I suppose it’s not classic, but a good mob reaction line that has stuck with me.
---
I have. It's a stat check. That's it. "Did you do the previous raid? Yes? You pass. No? You fail."
---
Aww diddums, is it getting too stwessfull. Well mongoloid, perhaps try acting less like a repugnant narcissist, and then you won't cultivate an audience 90% of whom are there solely to bear bait you like a jerry springer guest.
---
Take 20 to 50 percent off the top there big shooter.
---
The price of the helm (or its mats) may go up as more gold comes into the economy. The price of the mount will always stay the same. Thus buying the helm is more of an inflation hedge right now.
---
What's a good buff food for a 50s Warlock? Straight Spirit/Stam or does HP or MP /5 stuff actually help?
---
The droprate is 5%
---
Not the guy above, but if you want social interactions I’d say RP realms for sure have the most.
---
Oh man of course! Why would I throw away two gold to save myself 2 minutes of the hour long journey to the dungeon!
---
How silly of me!
---
Hope this is a first of many awesome lythemed cakes!
---
lol the fuck is wrong with this comment section? Looks like some people could use a piece of it, or maybe just a snickers
---
also lifetap to 10% on Eranikus fight, then be super surprised when you die in one hit after banish.
---
But they probably don't know either. I had a group where i wasn't too sure on the lay out after all this time and no one else knew either. They all stood around like headless chickens arguing so i had to pull up a map on screen 2 to guide them. If no one speaks up when you say hey i don't know where to go they are likely in the same boat, a lot of people i feel in wow act like they know where they are going but are just following the tank normally a bunch just seem adverse to looking it up and figuring it out.
---
Not saying tank should have to, but someone has to if all 5 are lost.
---
I could use any nature spell that was nice
---
I got killed 27 times trying to get to ubrs. Every time I corpse hopped to the balcony I got mind controlled into the lava and had to journey back up the chains.. shit was so frustrating 
---
Sulfuras is so horde dominated in every zone every time of the day.. it’s rough
---
Even ironforge wasn’t safe last night. Raid just camped the entry way for a couple hours
---
That’s a good idea. Thank you
---
With my warrior, I try and replace her primary weapon every 5 levels ("Tizzle's Mount Fund' has been replaced with 'Tizzles Kick Ass Weapons Fund').
---
If you allocate 20 gold per 5 levels, then thats not *too* terrible for your main to support, right ?
---
Not being a human would as well
---
I can answer the last one, and it depends on the guild. With my current one, I started deep resto but since we have sub 2 hour MC runs now and everything is on farm, I can run as 30/0/21. When BWL comes out, I'll have to respec full resto until it's on farm.
---
When I was on Grobbulus it was the same. Massive dickhead used to safe spot and kill everyone.
---
not \_super\_ active but it's here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicThunderfury/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicThunderfury/)
---
it uses a library with stolen code that's no longer compatible with most healing addons (they've switched to LibHealComm-4.0)
---
relatively low i'd say \~50
---
How you gonna straight up ignore the mechanics that cause the coordination of different groups, and specific knowledge of the bosses?
---
Yes they are pretty easy if you are overgeared or play on lfr, but it is a fact that they are more complex than vanilla.
---
I see "Maka Ogg" spammed all the time and I want to know what it means
---
Any recs for decent vendor trash? I guess farming was the wrong term.
---
I had the same thing happening while playing on WiFi in my laptop. Only wow was disconnecting, not Spotify or anything else..
---
I bought a Ethernet adapter and since I’ve been wired I haven’t dc’d in over a week
---
No. Can’t have it set to do both simultaneously. You’ll have to find some other buttons to zoom in and out. I use 8 and 2 on the  number pad to control the camera instead of the mouse wheel.
---
lmao
---
Yeah also if you get feared and leave combat while in fear and the target you tagged dies, you get no honor
---
$6,000 to $10,000 is alot of money for a collectors edition
---
I can't even spell you eye never mind figure out how to post a picture of it.
---
Cheers I'll look into that
---
I've got near full bis and with full consumes and raid buffs crit for about 1900
---
Now see, the problem with this is (at least when im trying to find dungeon groups) people dont want to LET you not tank, especially as a warrior, DOUBLE especially if theres a warrior tanking. 
---
The fact that you want nothing to do with their stamina/plate drops means nothing, they're afraid youll roll on them anyway. And unfortunately "bandage healer" isnt exactly a viable role to play. :/
---
I stopped even bothering with doing dungeons after BFD, because it didnt matter i was DW/fury decked out in agi/AP gear. "Nah, you're a warrior, just tank". If i didnt hate the way rogue played, id do that instead honestly.
---
I've probably ruined your life in wpl. But to be fair it typically takes alliance 3 to 5 deaths to enter BlackRock mountain so your tears are tasty.
---
I didn't even have that. I had sprints knockoff, the Samsung Katana.  Freaking Sprint.
---
Or the warlock can fucking eat or bandage instead of being a damn animal.
---
You okay buddy??
---
"us retail players" as in players of retail vs "all retail players are braindead zoomers", I'm sorry, I thought I was having a conversation with someone capable of some critical thinking , but I was mistaken.
---
This is correct
---
What keybinds would you recommend for abilities in terms of how often you use them and their importance? Are there any that can be cast aside or even not trained at all
---
The Print Screen button on a full size keyboard will do it, not sure otherwise either.
---
Not sure what level you are but if you can do it with a mount in low 40s that'd be the way to go
---
No surprise, pve wise he just has everything handed to him and everyone run him through every thing. Where's the fun? Content will of course run out.
---
Stop leveling engineering and sell everything you mine.
---
Also stop buying all your skills, only buy what you use.
---
Can I do rag without it?
---
Omg I used this and it was amazing!!!! The horde even left me alone for ten minutes while it came off cool down... I also couldn't use it while mounted and you know they used targetting macros and pesky Fels and arcane explosions but by golly for the two seconds where I was invisible, boy oh boy did I save me a HEAP of time!
---
nice!
---
Am I right to assume this happened back in the day too?
---
I think they only did it for the starting zones. I'm in the nochanges or classic+ camp but server pops weren't this high in vanilla, the spawn rates weren't setup for this population level. Something needs to change.
---
 I was mostly ahead of the pack on my rogue, but leveling my alt now, fighting for mob tags has nearly made me want to stop playing. (and I don't mean a little fighting, I mean 1-1.5h to do a quest that took 15-20m on my first 60)
---
I mean sure that's an option but when I said down time I meant when I'm watching Netflix or something and don't want to have my brain too focused on the game but still farming. In addition, mining in EPL is still quite efficient, may be less gold per hour but that's not what I'm focusing on, as well as I can do it in my own.
---
Its usually tied to what animation is happening already. I havent tried that.. ever actually, but I think its because the jump animation takes priority possibly? I mean most of the time, I never see WW's animation, especially if its after an auto attack or it does the shitty version where your weapon is vertical instead of horizontal.
---
I woulda just logged to my alts and let him waste his time, personally.
---
If this is seriously suggesting invis pots with 2 m cool downs and what is is? 15 sec up time? Then he really doesn’t know at all what we are talking about. Must be nice.
---
Or the healer can just heal and not complain about doing their job.
---
Log out with everyone else until the server pop is so low the honor grind dies or log back on after bgs drop
---
Playing priest taught me how to incorporate using my wand in mana management as a mage.
---
This is the reality that scares me, people continuously whinge and force changes for a problem that is solely their own making
---
Stupid policy. You are supposed to heal them, it speeds up the run by a lot. And the warlock is supposed to life tap and then drink/eat when everyone else is too. But if only the warlock is oom, he is supposed to life tap and you are supposed to heal him. This is how its done.
---
For 40 minutes? You need a new hobby.
---
I can't decide if classic or BC is my favorite era. WOTLK would be third. BC started it down a slippery slope with some features though. 
---
The problem for me with rolling out BC is it puts a timeline on this iteration or WoW dying. A lot of us know we will have classic for say 2 years, then bc for say 2 years, then wotlk for say 2 years then it's dead at cata.
---
Originally this wasn't such an issue because we didn't know how much content each xpac would get and didn't know what was coming in the next xpac (and if it'd suck).
---
That's why I'd rather get a classic+ system (even if it's just re tuned and re itemized raids/dungeons from various xpacs moved to classic world) but I don't think it will realistically happen.
---
What the hell happened here?
---
Then u bad? /s
---
Honestly a lot of people relied on raid leaders to explain pulls, and tanks would sometimes ask other tanks.
---
Forums like Elitist Jerks and Thottbot had information too, often shared by other users.
---
Also WoW did have a strategy guide for TBC that detailed every boss mechanic.  This was published alongside the game on January 16, 2007.
---
Exactly. It benefits every one.
---
Did someone just legit downvote me for saying thank you? Jfc
---
Probably positioning issues or no one using fire protection pots?
---
His "big dick, talk trash for content" persona is bound to attract that crowd. I remember in the early days when he bantered with people or really didn't give a fuck. Then came the bans and heavily moderated chat. Then spending half his streams talking about how "he's being harassed" or "everyone hates me qq". The "I don't give a fuck" thing kinda falls through when his only content is to bitch and moan all day.
---
That would be cutting edge not AOTC
---
I have specifically been farming jed with the dream vision elixir so I could get a group to farm truestrike. I've done about 20 runs, and in those runs I've seen 0 shoulders, about 15 reeds, 4 carapace (two back to Back) and 2 felstrikers. The 10% drop chance shoulders though? Not even once.
---
Sadly a good part of the warlocks I've met have a collective IQ of a small feet midget's shoesize. Always brilliant when they lifetap like their life depended on it while they are casting hellfire.
---
Correct, and there's a TON of false passage ways that look like they'll get you up, but are too steep at the end. Zone design isn't the greatest in Azshara.
---
Yeah in the LBRS run if they gave me enough time to get a few mauls off I’m usually fine for holding the aggro
---
Druid
---
U have encountered some bad warlocks dude. I almost never touch hellfire. I’ve personally never been in a situation where I felt hellfire was necessary. It’s not even on any of my bars.
---
They need an addon that includes LibHealComm. Most UI replacement addons have heal prediction and therefore this library loaded.
---
You talk mad shit for someone within frostbolt distance.
---
Yup, got two guildy rogues felt hats &amp; a fury warrior a reed last week. I a Resto sham also have mh/oh.  
---
When nobody wants, might as well do it for the lols.
---
Looks great man, and quite similar to my own setup. The only real difference is I’m using dominos and scale down my action bars even more. AWESOME SETUP!
---
Hmm I have healcomlib installed because my guild requires it for healers although I never saw any configurations for it. I'll check it out again when I get home
---
Well there are few exceptions, but try to ask something in the chat, you instantly get the Google it answer + sometimes he instantly ignores you too. My guess is that we are dealing with new-gen heavy ego-maniacs on PvP servers, and due to the nature of PvE servers there is a great chance that you might stumble upon normal people just enjoying the game but I can't confirm this.
---
No bad feelings
---
This sub is allergic to pvp unless it's an unarmed duel between two naked level 1 human paladins.
---
It’s like people are surprised that the most op class in classic is good.
---
When I've done grinds through the entire night, The HKs will split between Yesterday (+ This Week), and "Today", when I relogg in the morning around 8-10 am.
---
Haven't checked the exact HK count, but the honor increasing on This Week and the "left over" in "Today" seems to be taken into account the day after.
---
In other words, I don't think this is an issue for me atleast, but I haven't exactly counted, it seems accurate.
---
Welcome to /r/classicwow
---
Duel mages would probably be the best if you are on a pve server. Duel AOE on groups of mobs would make them go down quick and less likely to get to you making survivability better and having dual frost nova in case one misses.
---
Or I would go mage hunter since the hunter gives the utility with traps to either slow the groups or more aoe. The mage would also save money with water.
---
You could do hunter hunter but I think it would hinder you more since they excel leveling more solo but any combination is still viable.
---
Also, in instances be aware of how much more easily you'll rip aggro, if you have heavily enchanted weapons and it's an at-level tank ...
---
This! I hate when I’m at full Hp. I personally feel like I did something wrong if my hp is full but my mana is not. But of course the noob healers, not calling all healers noobs, will always try to get me to 100. Dude I’m a warlock. Balancing my hp and mana is part of my charm!! Save that 1 extra heal for when we pull a pat by accident or something.
---
corpse camp at BRM? its 3.30 in the morning and ive got chased down whole epl from bunch of nerd mages who eventually got me cuz they are full mount speed enchanted + trinket, it took them 5min to get me and get back in this time, and they did it, tell me pls about these "people"
---
Alliance* Fixed it for you
---
Horseshoes have no meaning by themself - it's just the icon I choose to use to mark paths on the map.
---
The special info is that the icons mark the paths to get from the lower beach to the upper land. For every one actual path in Azshara, there are 10 that look promising, but lead to a dead end, so getting from the lower to upper area can be a real pain in the ass.
---
Thanks!
---
This. Also don’t be that warrior tank who never heals himself? Or is does that not apply to tanks? No sarcasm btw. That’s an actual legit concern I have with tanks.
---
I'm going to take a guess and say our alt isn't 49 or more where you are worth honor to 60s.  The moment you are worth honor to 60s your life becomes hell.
---
Basically this mentality birthed retail and was the reason people screamed for classic.
---
Now it's repeating again.
---
If you've seen the state of the wow reddit you would understand why people are so negative towards this kind of stuff.
---
I one shot rabbits on the reg
---
People with 200 viewers can support themselves without a job.
---
I use rank 1 resurrection to bring locks back after they tapped themselves into one shot country.
---
Why didn't I heal them before? Cause I am managing my mana and it's their responsibility to not pull aggro.
---
Very true. But rogues have feint death. Haven’t tried it yet, but sounds promising.
---
Im 38 so I will just wait until 40
---
Thank you! This looks great.
---
I love when I start bandaging a lock so they can lifetap to get mana right quick and they just sit there and let me bandage them at full health and then life tap once the bandage is over,..
---
This, exactly. I didn't know and did it the other way around, now I can't craft fucking sapper charges. Thank god I got my friend to go goblin engineering. Still pissing me off, though. There's no way I'm going 0-300 a third time lol.
---
Start your character in Teldrassil, move to darkshore, then ashenvale, plus a quest chain in stonetalon, then later on, quest in Feralas, finish up with runecloth and morrowgrain, if you didnt quest in the lower level zones when they were relevant you're SOL and morrowgrain and runecloth are your only options.
---
And 2 good ones to boot - especially for the 49 twink bracket. Congrats / damn you and your luck.
---
Oh... I'm rank 3. Could you explain how I can get my epic mount for 800g?
---
Im a noob. Thanks!
---
You clearly dont play on a server with bad faction balance. So ill tell you how it goes as a frost mage trying to get to BRD from searing gorge.
---
You land in thorium point and die immediately. You run to the edge of your corpse range and hope to get mounted. You are immediately chased from all directions. A warrior charges you so you dismount and blink away. You dont have time for the gcd of frostnova. You pop ice barrier and try and survive for 5 seconds and ice block while frothing horde players wail away on your icy prison while simultaneously laughing and spitting on you.
---
You sit there in horror for the entire 10 seconds. When it ends you have just gotten blink back up so you use that and get a little bit further. You pop another ice barrier and immediately use coldsnap, so you can ice block again. The hordes are yelling ok boomer and go back to retail while stroking their now engorged and bloodlust filled carrots on a stick just centimeters away from your ice encased face.
---
Yet another blink and ice barrier. You try and frostnova but you finally die while they defile your mangled corpse. You managed to get pretty far.. you think. When you look back you realize you have just traveled about 55 yards from the flightmaster. And only attracted more horde.
---
This is just the start of an hour long journey of death and torture.
---
I dig the regular wow look on unit plates but I need something to help me see my party's health and especially mana better. Playing priest on my alt. Any suggestions? Would like to keep the regular wow unit plates tho.
---
You've never been in a situation where you could/should use AoE? Hellfire is nearly 3 times the damage as rain of fire and if you're not dumb you won' t pull so there is really no risk.
---
&gt; U have encountered some bad warlocks dude.
---
but also  
---
&gt; I almost never touch hellfire.
---
I am going to one up this and ask if warriors/bear Druid charge thru it will also trigger it lol.
---
Rngesus has smiled upon you, gratz alliance scum lol
---
Jesus. If only I had this summary earlier.
---
Morrowgrain has nothing to do with herbalism
---
I mean reading these posts, I can believe it that half the people commenting here really just mashed their buttons as they come in retail, sucked dick in lfr so now they enjoy the complicated gameplay of classic and post stuff like "I enjoy auto attacks".
---
Healers should not be healing anyone to 100% ever (in combat), it's much more efficient to bounce around the 80% range,
---
Worth the 2g eh?
---
Using this item starts a quest: https://i.imgur.com/cZaLY6R.jpg
---
And since epic mounts are BoE, you can give 800g to a friend who is rank 3, if you aren't already and he can buy it with the 10% pvp rank discount as well as the rep discount. This will save you an additional 100g 😄
---
Fucking shaman pro right here
---
Right? Wine and bitch but they are on a PvP server. 
---
It’s fuckin hilarious honestly.
---
I'd say it depends on your server then, because i've never seen any of that as horde on razorgore
---
I was trying to trinket rogue stun (as priest), and combat log said "can't do that while confused". Wth is this?
---
I play on a US-west server
---
No, it will slow down a lot soon.
---
Nice man like a guildie of mine got 2 forrors books in 1 run :/
---
the overpopulation on crowded servers make it unbearable there werent 24/7 5+ groups raiding in all endgame zones in vanilla, cuz the server cap was significantly lower
---
That's literally why I asked, now stop being a condescending dick to strangers on the internet.
---
You should usually combine hellfire with void walker shield. I wouldn't really go for AoE in dungeons if there's no mage though.
---
You can get 300 engi as a level 36 which helps for the engi items.
---
What's the best way to find and join a guild while leveling? I want to try to find a guild to join, but all seem to want endgame raiders, which I am no where close to right now. Also, does Arugal have a discord?
---
What realm are you on and level are you currently? I swear I just saw you while I was playing.
---
God damn, I recognised the art style but not the name. Remember seeing his comics back in 2006.
---
Time to read the entire archive!
---
I wouldn't say a rogue who 100-0ed me in a stunlock "one shot" me.  I would say when I ambush-crit someone and they die that I did in fact one shot them.
---
Play when they sleep.
---
Bro I'm still trying to figure out why as a Rogue I cant wear spirit gear. This piece has more armor and it is blue. Spirit mostly and some intellect. If nobody else wants it why can't I just take it? Don't you want higher armor levels or is that not as important? I put out a ton of damage still
---
Did you hear that sound? Think it was the joke flying right over you
---
Basically he one punch mans everything, so of course it doesn't feel rewarding to him on any meaningful level. 
---
Is it good for his stream tho? Definitely, this guy can stir up drama on demand, which in turn means good business for him.
---
For maybe the most popular and recognizable gaming franchise spawned in the modern Era? Sounds cheap.
---
Maybe at certain SP break points, but while leveling this is 100% false as your slow long heal is more efficient with no SP
---
What episode of Stargate is this?
---
Also- I love this :)
---
you don't need to do maximum dps for dungeons. in fact I would take mediocre dps over "leet" dps that makes the run annoying for the tank or healer.
---
not interesting to watch or even do, jesus i pity those ppl just standing around hubs "farming" honor for that long
---
Or just eat or use a bandage. It's not hard.
---
You're essentially asking the healer to use extra water (which isn't free and takes time) so you don't have to use any food.
---
Nah this just happened at 2pm on a weeekday to me. We know this though, you gotta sting an move.
---
gotem
---
Are you kidding?  Leveling in this game sucks ass.  It's fucking awful.
---
Yep, after a while raiding becomes a casual affair anyway. Due to lockouts you can only raid once or twice a week, which is only like a couple hours commitment - and then you might need to invest a few hours a week to prepare consumables and whatnot. That’s really all you need. 
---
Source: I work a lot and i’m a core dps in one of the top raiding guilds on one of the busiest servers.
---
This is why I love classic wow and try to be a good teammate whenever I group up. Never know when you'll run into the people you meet again.
---
Does it work with Luna?
---
In my experience with my priest and their speadsheet of HPS and HPM calculated that is the case.
---
He asked in general chat if anyone wanted to quest together....then 5 hours went by
---
Sounds like OP bailed mid dungeon to me
---
I’m only level 40 as a tank so I doubt my advice will be very helpful but I found that watching a quick video of the dungeon beforehand helped me tremendously in every dungeon I have tanked. I’m sure the dungeons will get more complex from here but the walkthroughs on youtube are quite helpful.  
---
Note this does not apply to Gnomergan. I believe I have tanked that dungeon 3-4 times and still have absolutely no idea where to go 😂😂
---
Yup, had a quick power outage! By the time  computer turned back on I was put in a 180 min queue. Even though I was playing for 8 hours before the outage happened. Would be nice for Blizzard to somehow recognize that you were playing for that long beforehand, and be able to put you back to the front of the queue
---
I'm a level 50 alliance on Netherwind too, I agree with the horde guy responding. I've been killed maybe 5 or 6 times but I often see a few alliance packs roaming around killing horde. 
---
I actually think I've been killed less since the honor system started, so maybe you should give it a try again. A lot of horde just wave or run away from me, I'm guessing out of fear from a pack of alliance 60s descending upon them.
---
Look for turtle scale helm/chest/legs on the AH. Crafted gear with intellect and spirit that's right around level 40.
---
Other slots you can get random AH greens. One or two cloth pieces won't kill you if you have a good shield.
---
If that’s the case, then OP is definitely fucking dumbass noob trash.  Bro.
---
The pouch use effect does not actually work at lvl 19. You can equip the off-hand but when you try to use/cast the on use effect it says target is not high enough level. The item is only used for the +stam.
---
Or do I owe her an apology?
---
Yeah threat meters often end up out of whack on ony, just let the tank get some time to rebuild their threat again when she lands and it should be no problem. Tell your DPS to wait.
---
Ehh that’s not true, CC and interrupts are necessary for m+, and some raid encounters.
---
Already asked and answered, op said it was random.
---
Won't life tap damage stop the bamdaging?
---
PepeLaugh HE LACKS CRITICAL INFORMATION
---
I mean Ironforge.pro currently has it as 65/35 over the last two weeks and more alliance leave or quit daily due to how bad it is. But sure, downvote away.
---
I’m familiar with this. You no longer enjoy the game but addiction keeps you thinking about it and wanting to log on. You have to discipline yourself, and just stop playing altogether - OR what i’m planning on doing is just limiting my play time to raid nights or getting ready for raids. No more logging on just because the addiction is itching, only to waste my time jumping around Undercity or something.
---
Nope, you'd think it does but it doesn't.
---
We’ve made the dragon breath chili before too! Hands down my favorite chili ever. Having three different meats in it (plus unique stuff like cocoa powder and cinnamon) make it so flavorful!
---
Edit: I would suggest trying the turkey... we’ve used the wow cookbook recipe for thanksgiving a few years now, and I love it!
---
naw i quit towards the end of september when it was unfortunately obvious to everyone that the servers were all going to be like 90% horde. i just havent unsubscribed to the subreddit so i can see whats going on.
---
The op said there is no context and it was complaining random.
---
What u think horde is gonna do when they have bg queues
---
I can’t tell you how funny P2 posts have been for someone who played for 3 years on a PVP server at launch.
---
I ran a gnomer today with one, they would lifetap to no hp then just stand there, or go into the next pull with no hp. I just left them at 20-40% hp till they started sitting down and eating/drinking every once and a while
---
It's selfish and wastes everyone else's time when you could just take some time to learn on your own. Duh
---
Same. Just pay 1g for the portal. Then all good. I'm mage btw
---
Yeah.. We can actually win a lot of 1v1s on an open plain starting at max distance... But that's very few and far between. In the meantime we have mechanics like leeway and batching kicking our CC and kiting ability.
---
Be quiet. Tired of people making up shit excuses for blizzard and their actions. Blizz could have more money than every other company in the world combined and they still wouldn’t give a shit about their player base or add better servers or add actual human GMs in the game instead of bots. Miss me with your bull shit.
---
And is killing a player who wouldn’t reward honor lol
---
so pick a server thats not like that? honestly tho you should stay away cause the game doesnt really need more douchebags i guess
---
Thanks for the info
---
First 2 mobs looted, meanwhile there are 9 dead lashers looted in front if you...  or your spent a few hours farming and 2 dropped at the same time?
---
Just goes to show, no matter how much money you make sitting at home all day playing WoW, it's not enough when you're a whiny entitled little kid.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Arugal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arugal/) 
---
try asking here, im pretty sure there is a discord but i can't remember where i saw it.
---
Thanks for the little tip ofc
---
I don't think edgemasters is. Krol blade and freezing band is though.
---
I didn't downvote you. I guess if you have a source it must be that bad but it doesn't feel so sure to me.
---
Eh at the same time though healers should trust them to have a bit.
---
When I've played MMOs healers often feel as though if you're not at 100% you need a heal.
---
Often time though I dont and can just be healed up at the next AOE.
---
No one gives a shit. Used to like Asmon I still do but fuck him he has no right to complain when he gets every damn thing handed to him.
---
I mean, wouldn't too long of a grace period result in *even longer* queues?
---
And then, even worse, the spots would be taken up by people not even online.
---
Ya
---
Sometimes my summons just seem to not go through.  Why does this happen?
---
Why on earth would the gnome respawn AT the corpse? If you have a camper, get as far towards terrain/objects as possible so you can respawn and conceal yourself.
---
Someone on endless consumables will not be in the same guild as a casual player so that's a silly statement. It's also not very hard to get a few basic consumables so turning up to a raid with nothing is both lazy and selfish especially since you are also crying that you somehow deserves loot for putting in zero effort. Loot council is just one option, there are others that take the friends aspect out of the equation, I would normally suggest you find them.
---
How long is Azuresong Mageblade bis for mages?
---
We were both Shaman and he didn't like the way I was playing so he started telling me what to do. He was hardly using totems, mindlessly ES'ing lightning bolt after lightning bolt, pulling aggro because he's level 15 and using earth shock over and over, and then bitching at me for not doing the same.
---
Meanwhile I'm strategically ES'ing their heals and sleeps only so as to not pull aggro, throwing tremor totem if they resisted or if there were multiple, and the run is going perfectly fine.
---
Then I won a chest roll which had an engi pattern in it. Another member asked if I needed it and I said yes as I'm an engineer. So dipshit here is immediately like "ok well use it. Learn it right now."
---
Instead of going through the hassle of explaining to him that A. I won the roll so I get to do what I want with the items and B. I wasn't yet high enough to learn the pattern, but would certainly use it when I could, I just gave it to the other member, thanked the other three, and left.
---
I guess he didn't like the fact that his carry got fucked up but I'm not interested in helping someone like that.
---
Edit: Oh, and they were all guildmates. I sent the other three a gold each and a note apologizing for bailing. Hopefully word gets back to him.
---
Yeah I always think people take optimization wayyy too seriously in classic. Everything is faceroll level difficulty anyway. But this is also just the modern gamer mindset. Can't play anything but the optimal build or else you're a "meme gamer" or something. 
---
I love how people use the word "it's not viable in classic" when almost everything is viable since the content is so easy. Things were a bit harder in vanilla, mostly due to the class design in classic being stuck on 1.13 or whatever the build is, but it still wasn't too hard. 
---
The only place where things like that aren't "viable" is if you're trying to speedrun something, which in itself is kinda a tryclown way to play a casual game.
---
You probably gank lowbies and got what you deserved
---
Is brightwood bis for many classes? Certainly easier to get than farming BOED+drakestone, but still.
---
All the way man.
---
If you’re horde make sure shamans pick up main tank healing during baron priest dispel time
---
Healcomm is useful
---
Make sure people are rezzing rezzers first
---
While I wish him all the best in life, him and streamers like him exhibit a certain personality where it's just much more entertaining to see them fail and rage in a game. I suspect part of the reason is he can be very loud and obnoxious. Doesn't really matter if it's just a persona he puts on for the stream. He seems to switch between "I'M A LITTERAL GAMING GOD!" to "yea I'm just not good at video games 'cause X, Y and Z". Often blames others instead of owning up to his own mistakes etc. If he feels his stream and community is getting more and more toxic he should change his own attitude first 'cause that negative attitude is what made his stream that way in the first place. It reminds me of a quote "There are no bad teams, only bad leaders".
---
Man yall acting extremely entitled. If you don't like the service, stop playing the game, stop paying Blizzard. Hyperbolic statements like them "not giving a shit about their player base" doesn't help anyone
---
And one for Skyrim. I have all of them. I am obsessed.
---
This is the best advice not mentioned nearly enough. Especially for class with high gear competition and without the ability to contribute much outside of dps (as opposed to warriors being able to tank, etc.), making friends on your way to 60 is of the utmost importance. Actively seek ways of improving their gear and the favor will be returned ten-fold.
---
It’s kinda interesting. Games like wow were the places nerds like me could go to not have to worry about social anxiety.
---
where you're standing is a safespot too (I think), beware!
---
I’m almost certain that it is 0.4% or 0.5%. 
---

I started wow on classic, still mouseclick my potions and bind that i'm not used to but i work on it, i really need to buy a naga tho
---
Alteady set in that apartment. Seeing I already have a 60. :) but good tips
---
What about Asmon? 
---
He is jacked and still plays the whole day.
---
Also known as: "I've been called out to much for ninja looting, encouraging ninja looting and just being a shitty human being in general. I'm going back to retail to ruin their lives again"

Oh noes!?!?
---
There's really only 1 Horde guild that does the majority of the sniping aside from the random shitters here and there. Horde side mainly clings to Horde streamers just like Alliance side clings to Alliance streams. Olympus just makes up like half of the Alliance side for the server.
---
Had this happen last week in Molten Core. I went out to my mailbox after killing Lucifron, came back DC’d and thrown into a 5 hour que on Faerlina. My guild cleared MC while I was in que so I was saved for a week, not to mention the gear that was supposed to be defaulted to me dropped. It was pretty infuriating.
---
Heavily inspired by DnD/tabletop rpg mechanics by the looks of it.
---
I GAMON Will save us
---
I definitely got honor for people dying from dot after I left combat. Vanish/FD seem to reset it, though. Not quite sure what the exact conditions are.
---
Also if a mage blocks for full duration, it resets damage counters and whoever manages to snipe him as he exits gets full credit.
---
Wish they'd fix this shit but with BGs coming so soon they probably won't bother.
---
Well, in way he had "one shot" to pull off his combo and kill the opponent in a stun-lock situation. After that he be fucked. :)
---
Ya I heard it :D good episode too. A lot of my in game knowledge has come from the show even though I started in vanilla/TBC. I played  UD priest then and now so it was good hearing you stuck with it. 
---
Not to act like a fanboi but it’s kind of awesome you replied to this. Thanks again for making the show for real. I totally get why you gotta end it.
---
I played Old School Runescape a lot before Classic launched. Maybe added 2-5 people in a 4 year time span. 
---
In Classic I have 20+ people added from dungeon groups, random quests, and random PvP encounters. Yes, the social interactions are very prevalent.
---
Edit: I’m on Faerlina probably about to transfer to PvE LOL
---
Unless you don’t want to see Allies being mercilessly slaughtered. You’re in no danger as a Horde.
---
Well if difficulty isn't a stat check, and it's not learning fights... What is it? 🤔
---
Everytime i have a shaman on my warrior i always make sure i mention how much i love windfury
---
“Sometimes you learn by failing.” Ain’t that the truth! I went from near cockiness on my Paladin to lost puppy on my Warrior tanking. Sure, some of it was “it’s been 15 years,” but a lot is that the fights look _way_ different from a tank’s POV. I’ve been failing a lot but getting better, learning as I go, and am now tanking Rag and Ony. Fearful but steady progress.
---
The answer is druid. 
---
But dont you dare tell anyone!!!
---
I still want my easy t1 and os loot.
---
Youre absolutely right!
---
&gt;  was the reason people screamed for classic.
---
People didn't scream for classic, they screamed for vanilla, and got classic, which has mega population servers with enough horde neets to make the game unplayable.
---
Execution.
---
It's fairly decent for longevity if you're a priest, r druid, or enh sham looking to boost mana while maintaining decent top end. I'd say it's situationally useful but not explicitly anyone's bis.
---
Was In blasted lands the other night as a level 51 alliance warrior. My screen was grey the whole time, I forgot the game even had colour
---
Which is my point? By wearing leather instead of plate they can’t handle getting aggro.
---
Youre damn right. We have Wives and we need to take our anger out somewhere.
---
Closer to: got fed up with being attacked and left. But sure, invent your own narrative.
---
No they won’t, they’ll all be dropping them in the weeks preceeding the preceeding weeks because everyone will be dropping them in the preceeding weeks.
---
I bet you're real fun at parties
---
After I downed the boss, I looted him (2 blues), and talked to kromcrush before getting any buffs, then finally talked to the ogre twice - first for buff, second for chest.  However, I only got 2 blues in the chest. Is this expected?
---
I did everything I could to get to 60 in p1, I knew it would be bad, but this was way more than I expected
---
Bro.
---
He was just jokin man. Relax.
---
Just the alliance side, which was already low.
---
bro
---
Depends on the group and dungeon. Sometimes I'm just sitting there, waiting to start healing the warlock once hellfire starts cause tank don't need more than the occasional heal on a lot of trash and I just want the dungeon to go faster. Bring the deeps as long as you don't pull aggro from the tank.
---
"I'm wrong, but too proud to admit it. So instead I'll be a snarky ass."
---
My pleasure mate, appreciate the love in starting the thread :)
---
They really are soft. They just cry all day in Reddit. Wahhh we suck at PvP wahh we have to 5v1 horde to beat them and get upset when they invite 4 more people to even the numbers wahhh
---
Why even post something (and detailed too lol) if its not true at all. 
---
Poison is not affected by spell power. Not sure where you got your information from but its false. Poison doesn't scale with anything. Not AP, not spell power... it can't crit either.
---
After a wipe or bad pull while everyone is recovering, the party(tank incl.) should try to recover what they can before the heals starts topping everyone up.
---
Tanks should have potions for when things get hairy but other than that I'd consider the heals responsible for keeping the group full life throughout the run. On the flip side the group is responsible for making the sure the healer is happy, so just communicate if you need more time between pulls  to drink. 
---
A bandage is 2k over 8s, food is 2100 over 30, but a healer is priceless.
---
I'm not, I'm just saying it's lame
---
Cool beans bro. Enjoy it
---
Next upgrade would be claw of chromaggus then staff of shadowflame I think.
---
If all else fail, maybe you could restart and level together since you're getting him a new account. Boom. Father-son bonding time.
---
Scroll up from your comment. It was posted 16 mins prior to yours.
---
Edit: it wasn't. But he posted it further up
---
How do you kite him without killing him?
---
Lol @ the “Horde doesn’t have girlfriends!!” As if most people don’t play/haven’t played both factions. Keep crying
---
How’d you do it exactly? I’ve been having fun exploring hard to reach spots
---
&gt;thinking we have girls
---
Hahah good one OP
---
Nobody cares that you play on a pve server. What is it with this sub and people who play on PVE servers basically loving the smell of their own farts?
---
Where do those come from?
---
By applying and constantly reapplying a debuff which does not deal damage such as curse of weakness, scorpid sting etc. This way it's possible to keep a mob leashed indefinitely.
---
SGC? Drakestone? Yeah, that's a fuckload of time. There are people who have killed those bosses hundreds of time and are still empty handed. It's a fool's errand.
---
Apparently you missed the part where I dont care about Spy.
---
Unlike the other you mentioned, Spy functionality remained for every other expansion. This is not the same. #NoChanges
---
Would there be more to do if he got less gear? Right now the content for classic streamers is the weekly MC raid and...that's it. Look at any big streamer and most of their time is spent standing around in ironforge or duelling randoms outside of the city. There is just nothing to do.
---
I get that you're a Warcraft fan, but a Warcraft cookbook? Really? I wish Blizz focused more on the quality of its games instead of milking any penny they can get out of its past games. I mean when was the last time Blizz came put with a relevant game?
---
My first time in brd we didn't even make it to the first boss before everyone gave up. My second time we did arena got the boss for hand of justice which dropped. The healer rolled need and won and then everyone left. My third time I had a lock that pulled agro every chance they could and then the healer left. So yeah. I don't like the place
---
I love how everything put together gives the screen a sort of border.
---
Oh no, he cant steamroll everyone in pvp any more. Poor him. Any time horde counter attack he claims outnumbered  and other dumb reasons as to why he lose. Him and his "crew" are terrible at pvp and cooperation. And people are not stream sniping him.
---
Anytime he does something or ganks it is fine, whenever he encounter a little bit of resistance he start whining. Glad that his true colors are finally shining through.
---
Could potentially be bound to secondary keybinds, those don’t get displayed
---
Skeram horde is the true hard mode, everyone knows that
---
I hit 60, made my childhood dream and quit. But starting real life after this journey changed me.
---
I am much more friendly to people. No more "we should destroy humankind because people sucks"
---
One month free and my new view if world transformered my workplace into a small guild. We have some griefers but it doesn't matter. The true core of my "work guild" is something I appreciate.
---
Thank you guys for teaching me so much about life (not only this little thing I wrote).
---
Edit: And yup I saw the video, just wanted to tell you, "we shouldnt destroy whole humankind" screw him, keep calm and strong and focus on the good ones, ignore idiots / griefers. And take that into real life perspective too.
---
How about you keep your opinion to your self then, instead of telling them they are lame for doing what they enjoy.
---
There is no game that feels more like a job than retail wow.  Log in EVERY day or you might miss something, do your daily chores, now you can maybe do something you wanna do.  Unless you haven't done your 10+ key for the week, better knock that out before you do anything else because maybe you can't get on tomorrow, or the squad isn't on tomorrow.  
---
Okay thats done.  Did you honor cap?  Better honor cap or you don't get to play that slot machine next tuesday, because anything at any time can titanforge and be better than what you're wearing. 
---
Okay, you did your honor.  Now go get all the azerite you need this week.
---
Alright, now what do you wanna do? Oh wait, there's no "game" left.  It's all a series of chores so you don't fall behind.
---
About the only thing that's fun and not compelled to be competitive is farming transmogs and playing barbie dress up.
---
Hey can I get to know her?
---
Since most of the time you're using Imp in instances, I swapped Attack and Passive on the imp's action bar. Wheel down still pulls them back, but wheel up just puts them on passive.
---
Wowhead has a lot of incorrect info.
---
Who is nigma
---
To be fair, if you started at launch and arent farming the PvP honor kills, you may largely be out of content. I'm about 1/2 way through T1 pieces, have 2/2 T2 and my guild is working on getting MC clear times down to an hour. Now we aren't anywhere near the best or a try hard guild so I imagine anyone that is in a mediocre raiding guild is going to be somewhere around where I am at gear/content wise.
---
I am looking forward to BGs and AV but far more to BWL and AQ.
---
Last 2 bosses in BWL, the next raid
---
Yea, ive been told Im unique. Ive not played this game before classic and first thing i did was pick up Alch and Firstaid to heal my self then just continued it in groups.
---
You're not remembering it wrong. It's so absurdly different now and I believe it has something to do with the BFA client and pvp level scaling to "even out the playing field".
---
Yeah same. I’ve got two 60s and one I’m trying to get to 60. Plus a few other alts. I wouldn’t bother sticking around. Let him waste his time and come back to play your room another time.
---
Because a lot of the people who complain about pvp servers are better suited for pve servers if they want pvp *their* way and not the free-for-all that pvp servers are. The option is there and they're being reminded, since they seem to have forgotten.
---
I dunno what the point of OP's post was though. Making a whole post to complain about a server they're not on...? lol
---
Spy whiners.
---
He actually makes way more than that. That's like his subscriber money alone, you still have to add add-revenue and donations to that.
---
Solid question! I've read it has an approx. 10% proc rate. So if we assume one successful cast every 2 seconds (optimistic), then that would be 100 mana every proc, .1 × (60/2) = 3 procs. 3 × 100 = ~300 mana / minute. Napkin math.
---
All of those lashers have the sparkle shit indicating there’s loot on it. OP said first 2 looted, not killed
---
You can see that the other ones haven’t been looted yet. Even if that weren’t true, shut the fuck up and let the man be happy.
---
I did post a narrative after someone asked. I didn't include it in the OP because, like you said, who cares about my drama.
---
Maybe don't engage with a post you supposedly don't want to see?
---
On Earthfury, Everlook and Gadgetzan are constant war zones. Usually it’s Alliance trashing the town but today Horde were in charge, and honestly I didn’t even mind. A change of pace is refreshing.
---
Also I escaped their onslaught so it didn’t affect me.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Many pve servers heavily lean alliance, which will balance things out a bit. Sure not all of them will pvp, but still a considerable amount
---
Sounds like you had a bad experience. I'm sorry. I always try hard to help players who are new, we were all there at some point
---
Stargate?
---
It was honestly silly. And we're talking about Wailing Caverns here. Some real high level shit bro
---
It says it the tool tip they have to be atleast green my guy
---
Assume you meant disease?
---
Yeah I’m definitely still doing a lot of questing. I’m just impatient. Thanks for the info!
---
I try to do this as much as possible but not easy finding a 5 man as a warrior DPS. Tanks don’t want to share rolls, we get spoiled ha. I always study the dungeon maps and read the guides over and over but being inside always feels so different. Fortunately most aren’t that hard with a good group. I don’t think I’ve ever wiped on a boss, always just a bad pull or pat or something dumb like dying in the lava in BRD lava run.
---
If you play it like it's a job: yeah. You aren't gonna find many games that'll keep you entertained.
---
Exactly what I did on my lock
---
I'm not telling people they're lame, I'm saying the act of doing it is lame
---
More like "People literally corpse-camped me for 8 hours straight and I don't feel like pretending that the experience is fun anymore".
---
A lot of streamers complain about stream snipers, but asmon literally can't walk anywhere without a full raid of horde players trying to kill him at all costs.
---
&gt;The seed casing rewards actually scale off your herbalism level too
---
I learned something new today. Thank you both.
---
Why does this sub care so much about this guy??
---
It dropped for me today on my holy pally. New warlock in the guild specifically asked to do UBRS for Jed. I passed on it for him. It hurt my soul a little but I’m glad it went to a guildie.
---
Forget swipe and spam demo roar, thank me later.
---
This was the very first thing I thought when I read the post
---
49 best bracket.  Its great yall are keeping the dream alive!
---
Dire Maul is easy as fuck, just walk into the far East entrance just north of the Horde town, and die naked inside, now you can walk to any of the 3 dungeons easily.
---
Right. I mean I’m a tank and I post LFG way more than LFM ha. Something about having to create the group even though I’m going to end up leading anyway
---
Not really self centered or entitled, just kinda an impatient/stupid story. I was questing in Searing Gorge trying to kill some elite dwarf. I asked in general if anyone else had the quest, nobody answered. This random rogue invited me to a group and said he could kill the elites if I healed him. I agreed to heal him. He popped evasive and was taking almost no damage, then when evasive fell off he started taking a little damage. As I was casting a big heal, he popped sprint and jumped off a cliff to his death. He dropped group and started ranting about me in general.
---
A group of 3 people came along and rezzed me, then we all killed the elite. It was a super funny series of events.
---
Well it literally is his job, but even for semi-hardcore raiding guilds the game is really stale. BGs can't come soon enough, imo.
---
*bro*
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff is on my to-do list as a Feral tank. Easy way to get 15 nature resistance for AQ.
---
You get a 10% faction discount at honored rep and 10% at pvp rank 3
---
Yeah. Level 60s don't usually bodycamp people that don't give them honor unless you pissed them off somehow.
---
Did the same exact thing, healed a group for a mage in my guild so he could get it. He did, and he just left my guild like 3 days ago. Just the worst.
---
Yeah I’m realizing that questing now gives me items that are worth a decent amount, so I’m trying to grind those out. Thanks for the info!
---
In Luna you just have to enable heal prediction in the settings, you don't need to install any other addons.
---
Yeah I won’t be surprised if/when this guy bolts. Oh well
---
It's not a bad idea, but the two toons will compete for weapons drop if the Shammy goes Enhancement and both toons wear leather (and therefore compete for some armor drops) from 1-40 (at which point the Shammy can learn / use mail armor).
---
I'd seriously consider Warlock or Mage, but Elemental Shaman (and Resto, to an certain point) will compete for some weapons, rings, and trinkets (not all, but some).
---
Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
---
Good luck, have fun, either way.
---
I do wish more healers would at least wand attack or if they see a pull is easy (eg an arena run at 60), just join in with some dmg. IMO a good healer will quickly see how much dmg the tank takes against x type of mob pulls and can adjust accordingly. 
---
Side point, I feel like casters burn mana too fast on trash pulls. We shouldn’t have to take  drink break after every mob pull....am I wrong/ignorant?
---
Fuckin turd just took all the epics on his warlock who couldn’t even use them at the time.  I had a chance to kill him and didn’t even know he had an alt.  Ugh.
---
Tbh that's exactly what he said he'd do. Play every phase until there's nothing left to do, then play retail until the next phase.
---
Lol, talk about wasting both of your time.
---
How do black lotuses work? Can there be one in each zone at any given time (silithus, winterspring, etc), so technically like 5 of them up at once just all in different zones?
---
Also, do they have an exact respawn time? Can they spawn in the same node they were last picked from?
---
Most 49 twinks won't be able to get a BoED. Mara runs give a lot of experience and it takes a lot of runs to get that dagger to drop. You could plan out everything perfectly and still not see it drop by the time you're 49.
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff is the 49 twink item if you're not lucky.
---
World of Gamon
---
holy shit what are the actual odds of this?
---
I have 3 shammy’s and got butt fucked by a rogue.... 2 times lol multiboxing is fun but it ain’t allways gravy baby
---
I do think you have to unequip and re-equip to get it to add up correctly.
---
The point of Rez is to turn you from dead to not dead. 
---
Level 1 rez does this. 
---
It's not a brez. How much health and mana you have after the objective is achieved is a luxury :)
---
But I think you'll find its from saving the gold when levelling
---
The worst part is it’s not a unique experience. I’ve had this same scenario happen for most group quests. The only exceptions have been a handful of escort quests that I got nice groups for.
---
Boo fucking hoo. Somebody else got the dragon, you didn't get the loot. Cry more please.
---
That too. Lol. Shit loads of threat
---
G o B A c K T o R e T a i L
---
I’m being downvoted, but I play a Resto Shaman and have played daily since Classic WoW launched. I can put my hand on my heart and honestly say I have not encountered a single Warlock who used First Aid in a dungeon run.
---
Even Warlocks within my own guild - people I’m friends with and raid with on the reg - do not use First Aid. They all HAVE it, of course, they just don’t ever USE it.
---
So if you’re a Warlock, take notes. That “Recently Bandaged” debuff should be up 100% of the time. There is absolutely no reason to ever not have that debuff. It drives me insane.
---
Here's an idea, run back to town.
---
**bro**
---
It's a step up from MC in the coordination that a guild needs to have. Failure to make meaningful progress in bwl broke a lot of guilds.
---
Everyone knew servers were gonna be way bigger, everyone knew bgs weren’t gonna come out for while. It was easy to see this was going to happen and this kind of play was going to plague servers and make them terrible for those who can’t defeat the gank squadz. People still choose that life and still want to complain. It’s funny to me that people complain about PvP on a PvP server when anyone who has half a brain knew it would be like this.
---
Get your guild to help you.
---
We have been getting great honor by hiding near level 50s in our guild leveling and attacking horde that dismount and go after them .
---
Nothing worse than when you heal a Warlock to full after they finish using Hellfire and they think, “Hey full hp, time to do it again.” A good warlock (also goes for dps in general) manages threat gen/their own hp whilst being aware of tank hp/healer mana. Read the situation. Don’t be a pleb.
---
Fake news. 
---
I *know* a time machine when I see it, and that’s a flux capacitor.
---
Install it using the twitch app, it works perfectly for me and is definitely a must for locks.
---
Feign death causes the same issue. Release BGs and no one would care. Also if you kill a holy priest speccd spirit of redemption and you die before spirit does you don’t get your honour. 
---
This phase blows chunks.  GIVE US BGs NOW!!!!
---
I hadn’t gotten any either, farming 900g for epic mount in zf as a mage, on my last 200g of farming I got 2 gut rippers within 30 mins, shit was wild
---
Yeah I'd be dead within an hour
---
same, khaz goroth to frostmourne
---
That's exactly it, I have full pre raid bis and some raid items along with 1200g.  Every day I just login, check AH for random crap and sit in org for an hour then log off, but then the urge hits me to play again. Ugh.
---
Yes. 1 per zone is what most people say, but I've also heard 2.
---
50-70 min. They can spawn from any node.
---
Probably isn't playing at all. Even my medium/high population server is full of life.
---
44 priest with Staff of Jordan?
---
This is an alt starting shit and getting a taste of his own medicine
---
Why not ask for help from guild or general chat?
---
Good healers prefer locks who tap then bandage or sit their ass down next to the healer and eat, while the healer is drinking.
---
If a warlock needs more heals than any other dps they are doing it wrong. Or hellfiring, but that is an exception.
---
Cheers all will be looking into them when I get home :)
---
they give people the opportunity to be the bad guy
---
people are gonna do it
---
you played on a pvp server.. sry
---
Warriors can specialise in different weapon types via talents, so using your talented weapon type is optimal. 
---
What you can do, however, is leverage different weapons in each hand as a convenient way to level two weapon types at the same time.  
---
As a warrior you should be able to use every (real) weapon in the game, so you will be training weapon skill often.
---
Even on Horde Herod I have gotten to the point of raid logging as alts and farming in the world is too brutal. I plan to do more PvP when BGs launch, open world was fun for a week but now I'm just tired of so much dieing. Remember, Battlegrounds on the 10th!!!
---
if you get "ClassicAuraDuration" then it works
---
hey does anyone know gahennas ali vs horde ratio procent wise ? is it really bad for alliance there ?
---
You can message me if you want to here, or just put some questions here.  I recently finished up making my 29 rogue twink.
---
Resisted but not immune?
---
You're encountering WoW's secret boss.
---
It wreaks havoc worldwide, we are still hunting it down. It is Cagey.
---
EDIT:
---
Yeah, imo, I think it's just lag so even if it works on your end, the person sees the pop up box and clicks yes, the lag times it out and it doesn't work.
---
annoying - especially if it still consumes the shard
---
You will be ok at that level, however you also won't like it compared to before.  Wait for battlegrounds early next month to spend your cash
---
Lol
---
https://i.imgur.com/DmeGxsA.png
---
Took my words out
---
you mean the true war chief??
---
Run ahead, wand, let it run to you, sheep to full, repeat. Bandage occasionally.
---
I can handle a good gank, adds to the fun, otherwise i would not play on PVP.
---
However what i really hate is dumb arse preists sitting on a boat all day and MC'ing people off the boat before it transitions so you got swim all the way back and wait for the next boat.. No honor for them just pure scumbuggery..
---
Literally was debating playing classic just to hear him cry about being ganked. I can't stand him.
---
as a paladin, healing a warlock to full for 35 mana so they are good to continue is always the best option.
---
Squats use back muscles if you're doing it with weight
---
1958
---
that looks absolutely terrible.. wow
---
immune*  
---
It's an arcane elemental, so immune.
---
This.
---
thanks a lot！
---
Big noob question how do I use an items effect? Ex my offhand orb heals me for x on a cd do I have to open the char screen in combat or am I missing something? Thank you in advance
---
I'd argue that every class should have bandages ready, even healers.
---
You might not need it often, but every now and then you can save the day with 1 bandage in a critical situation.
---
Nah warlocks. You can sit a mob and the tank has three seconds to sneeze on skull and pull agro.
---
In dungeons though it's better if the tanks pulls so they get body agro on everything
---
Yes it's real bad
---
Bc some of us aka me lol do absolute shit for dps. That's why when I was asked to respec dps in my guild I told them no n that was my reason. Idk why I cant do it but I see the numbers warriors in my groups are putting out and compare that to mine n theres a 50+ dps difference.
---
Wait isn't there PvE servers designed for people who don't want to play the game like this? Why not go there
---
As a Druid tank. I always pop out between pulls and hot the lock so the healer doesn’t have to waste mana. Gives me a lil xtra threat too
---
Bruh, if anything Blizzard should lock you out until you get up and get blood circulating through your legs.
---
&gt;This is why I prefer PVE servers
---
Your title gave that away already
---
Whitemane alliance is warm and nice.
---
Combat is boring.  Respec hemo when you are high enough.  Much more fun, better survivability, and better for pvp.  I didn’t find damage to be much worse than combat either.
---
&gt; idk i cant tell if you people are full of shit or what.
---
It's pretty much safe to say at this point that most of the situations here are greatly exaggerated and embellished upon.
---
This maybe happened once on his server, someone got mad and "This is an issue that *must* be addressed!" - sure, there's video, but this isn't a thing that most people experience. Just like there are videos of ninja looters, doesn't mean it's this rampant issue that is destroying the game for every player.
---
It's the same with the whole "corpse camping" thing. Yeah, it happens once in a while in heavily trafficked areas and is annoying, but the game is far from "broken and unplayable" as everyone claims.
---
What's really ironic is how people complain about retail being dumbed down by casuals and caters to the masses, yet people are doing the same shit with classic: a game exists exactly as it was 14 years ago that spawned the ocean of bitching that ultimately evolved into the game we have today.
---
Someone still needs to clear all of the mobs up to the boss while you wait outside and then port in and suicide after everything is dead. That's ~30 minutes per run (not counting the time it takes to leave and reset the dungeon) on content that's not trivial for a level 60 to solo. Someone might help you do that, but they're going to want something significant from you in return.
---
That's a real pain in the ass for an item that's arguably worse than the Glowing Brightwood Staff (because no stamina).
---
you get a scaling miss chance against mobs that are red or higher. Players do not get this same benefit/detriment. your chance to hit a level 60 as a level 30 is only against their raw dodge values, which is only about 10% in most cases.
---
Drag it to your action bar is he simplest way, can macro it too.
---
Razorgore
---
Are you using the twitch app to download your addons? Necrosis works perfectly fine for me.
---
Could have died 30 times.
---
It’s just the dwarf’s Scottish accent
---
No, the solution is to release battlegrounds earlier than planned, which is already happening.
---
\&gt;Made by Pint 
---
\&gt;People telling the OP good work
---
Okay
---
I tell groups this because im lazy
---
I feel sorry for the OP. First, he’s attacked by this Sulfuras dude. Then he has folks on redit assuming the worst. #ifeelforyoubro. Keep your head up high. You didn’t deserve that treatment by anyone. Hope you continue to enjoy Classic despite the few rude folk in-game.
---
It’s not really hard to do, if that’s a consideration.
---
Pick up first quest at main city, speak with Tabetha (good excuse to get the FP there). 
---
Head to Thousand Needles, quest through there while completing the chain there too. 
---
Do SM Lib, get book. 
---
Get Sticks, which overlaps with a kill quest
---
And then you’re done. Considering every stage has either something useful or will get you XP beyond the quest XP, can’t imagine it’s inefficient. I finished it off at 37 but could have been done earlier easily.
---
This guy gets it. I didn't make it, just shared it because I saw it in my subscription feed.
---
Got a dummy question that I can't get answered.  If you've got two pieces of gear on a twink Hunter/Rogue and you've gotta choose between +10 stam or +10 agi, which are you going to choose and why?
---
Twinks aren't strong without high stam, but when do you choose damage?
---
Edit:  An example like choosing Feet of the Lynx or Angler Boots.
---
Yea I used to pass by horde and not care now I kill every one I can. Me and a bunch of upper 40s camped a skull druid outside mara for a couple kills yesterday and had a blast doing it. Its was like children of the corn swarming him with slows and mortal strikes til he died
---
That stuff is worse than getting ganked. Waiting for the boat takes time and swimming back in the middle of the ocean takes even longer. It's so nasty that it's hilarious when it happens to someone else. :)
---
ps. On my alt, I skip the boat when I see a hostile high lvl Priest onboard. Learnt my lesson.
---
Oh wow I cant believe I didn't think of that thank you
---
Lol I actually did this tonight. Usually I wait for my healer to have around 60% before I pull. I pulled n he had 20% we made it through but he was bitching at me the whole time over discord lol
---
Migrate To a lesse pop realm...
---
&gt;"you left your door unlocked, so it's your own fault that you got robbed"
---
Worst fuckin analogy bruh, you are out in the open world where it's expected that you can attack people or be attacked, you aren't sitting in your house eating dinner.
---
&gt; after that melees still get aggro and you have to taunt it back as MT
---
If the melees move to the outer ring while the ot has the boss, no melee dies and the melees only move back in after the MT is on the boss again.
---
You can see the same tactic in the APES firstkill video, we use the same strategy and we dont lose a single melee. We have 9 Warriors and 6 rogues + 2 tanks. tanks obviously not standing in the meleegroup.
---
I dont know I have no knowledge about the gamecode all I can say is that our MT has no problem at all to consistently keep aggro of ragnaros with my above explained strategy, the only time he loses aggro is during the time the OT has ragnaros for like 5 seconds.
---
If the melees move in and out properly (you have to go the max distance, as a melee you almost have a foot in the lava) during the tankswap, no melees die ever. Dont put the retribution paladins or enhancer shamans into the meleespot because they have mana and mana classes will be targeted by the ranged fireball knowback and explode your melees.
---
This is all i can say, our strategy works for us no dead melees.
---
Loot at all that optimal, not optimal gear!
---
Oh come on not even a little 2nd lunch?
---
Many fights require decision making on the fly due to randomized mechanics, and you don't have to raid the previous tier to raid the next as catch-up gear is always available. Bosses are only a gear check if you're fighting for World/Realm first, otherwise, the vast majority are mechanics/coordination checks on a much higher complexity than fights in Classic.
---
When Demon's Souls released it was hard as fuck, now it is piece of cake compared to Sekiro or Bloodborne. It's the same concept with Vanilla and later expansions: gamers get better and require more and more challenges.
---
Could never stand this Mongoloid...who gives a shit enough for this to even be posted here in the first place?
---
Watch your soulstone count- if it uses one, its gone through, and the other person has 2 mins to accept if they’re not on a flight / dead I think.  If they dont accept... you lose the stone i think
---
Make each level of mana stone and use one early in the fight
---
Yea, animations in Classic are kinda off, I see it more often against creatures though. For instance if a non humanoid creature is running, they won't do their attack animation when they attack you, so instead you'll just silently take damage, there's other animation oddities I've seen too. I'm not sure what they underlying issue is with animations, but there's definitely something not right.
---
Issues like this are common place in Classic unfortunately, I've noticed tons of things that are either bugged or just not quite right.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
All I care about is AV. I'll only ever leave to get more gear to hit harder in AV.
---
Get a shadow priest or meme Ret! That what I do when I run dungeon with my resto druid friend
---
He also did this as an Alliance on Stalagg, so he gets double props.
---
If your name is red. You die. End of story
---
People are worth honor to 60s all the way down to level 49.  The wow classic pvp system is a grind against your peers so achieving every bit of honor you can while there are no bgs is pretty important, unfortunately anyone who yields honor is worth killing.
---
You gotta put in the hrs during weekend or vacation to farm gold/get xmute chars, this allows you to just raid log and farm a bit of cons during the rest of the game.
---
BC
---
This is not a one shot
---
Yeah.. not in the OP though.
---
imo, spirit stam would be better,
---
def. try out a hp/5 or a  mp/5 - really whichever provides more bang for your buck - so try all and see which suits your playstyle more.
---
e.g. 
---
Raids - stam might be better due to possible splash dmg
---
solo - hp/5 might be better due to it allowing more life taps
---
dungeons - mp/5 might be better because reasons
---
Usually, there is just one food that you should use, but as i main a war. idk.
---

i think the first one is better but the second one looks prettier XD
---
Except that doesn't happen. He literally has 5+ guilds he can call on and can have rally to him day/night if he is getting griefed. Imagine being corpse-camped with the ability to call 2 raids full of 60s easily and then complaining that you can't help but be corpse camped. 
---
He also was the one who started this by saying that he was going to grief horde on the server and be "toxic as fuck."
---
Are there any other Alliance streamers who are getting camped like you allege he is? And outside of Advertise, who streamed being literally stream-sniped and corpse camped by Unbind and his "thousands of spergs in Olympus" for hours on end, has there been any horde corpse camped like you allege?
---
It started in BfA. I know Classic is based on a Legion patch, but they must have updated it. BfA is the expansion where cutting costs and squishing out as much money as possible started (mass gm layoffs, virtual servers, transmogset blizzcon rewards, pushing the token with a deflation that forces people to boost en mass, 5 million gold mount artifical scarcity).
---
They clearly want to cut costs in Classic as well in terms of servers (and don't bother with different server structures). Especially since they can't earn money in Classic with selling tokens, transmogs and mounts.
---
Is this whole sub alliance or something
---
Sounds like PvP is happening on a PvP server and someone doesn't like it.
---
It's wow classic... All part of the experience
---
I have never been a big quester or a big leveler, but here it's all part of it, back to the basics.
---
You want to rush 60 so you can do "all" the endgame content?
---
Asmongold: "We run this server" "When Classic will be out you can try to gank me but guess what, I will have so many players around me protecting me you have no chance"
---
And now a week after Phase 2 pvp:
---
Asmongold: "mommy! mommy! help me they gank me and I cant play the game!"
---
He thought he will be the best classic player of all times and now he is the biggest pussy the alliance has ever seen. Getting ganked 8 hours a day? Yeah thats what you get if you advertise yourself as being the god of classic.
---
"When the time comes to strike an emperor strikes without hesitation. To entertain doubt is to dance with death."
---
Good to have some extra iron.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MniAwwFKsg
---
Wtf. I didn’t know that! They can’t bandage??? Never played one. Shit I feels bad now
---
Not surprised, but the “effort” is just it. P2 has pitted the casuals who are hitting the 50s now against more hardcore players who have been 60 and raiding for 2 months. Sorry not sorry my RL means I don’t play that often - it has been fine and fun up until now. 
---
As for my fellow 50s, I feel you. UnGoro is the worst because of the godawful corpse run. I find Badlands at least a little less miserable - worst case, spirit rez and high tail it back to Stonard. Otherwise I’m just doing as many dungeons as I can.
---
Whatever it takes
---
Yup. “Aw that’s adorable. OH GOD OH FUCK”
---
P3! im sure the other world events and stuff will be cool but BGs are everything to me
---
Bout treefiddy
---
Yeah I've had freezing band. Took. Me. Over 200 runs.
---
I guess it depends on the population of your opposing faction, and your ability to absolutely roll through multiple enemies in a row. I'm a shadow priest, so I oom quickly and lose critical buffs if I waste resources on lowbies. And 57 seems farmable. I meant like sub-55, I'm not sure the threshold.
---
There is nothing to look forward to if you get full bis in 2-3 weeks like he did on his lock alt.

Thanks everyone here for the responses, really appreciate the advice and I will try to suggest a few things.

Oh good, maybe other people in those raids will start getting geared.
---
PFFT NAH
---
You can only have 1 at a time. My guild ie got 2 in 5 runs.

Protip:  My icon is a warlock.

It is on pve servers where you belong.

You think any horde player has ever touched a woman? Even the women?  
---
&lt;laughs in abs&gt;
---
Was doing a Mara run. Blue bow dropped which no one needed so we all greed except for the lock who needs and says he can give it to his hunter. Sure i guess, but maybe run the instance on your hunter? I could use it as rogue but its not really needed so whatever.....
---
Same run someone rolls need on a rare neck that is good for no one but worth serious coin just because he "wanted to win something for once".
---
Basically just typical pug ninjas. Almost left straight away but was close to princess (still no ring drop rip).
---
Lmao this made my morning, thanks
---
Looks kind of salty.
---
Pretty sure that’s why they used an image of WWI. That was griefing and camping: the war.
---
Bard ofc. The classic rpg support class

You can be summoned while flying

we need to make everyone see this so that it becomes patched.

Nah, not sure man. Than it would make no sense for all the level 60 to kill lowbies

Asmon threatened to kick them if they do it again.
---
Whoever played it clearly is new to the game or has no idea how to pvp.
---
It’s not possible for a streamer of his caliber to hit rank 14, he has to always have a 40 man raid behind him otherwise he gets stream sniped hard. Even with the raid there’s always 3+ rogues on him. And being in a huge raid nets you such little honor.
---
His only chance to rank is when battlegrounds launch, even then horde premades will be super competitive who knows how it’s going to turn out.
---
(Before anyone replies, I am not a fan of his. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out the issues with streaming multiplayer games).
---
You want the wand for sure, and you want the orb that comes next. I use both at 60 still and will keep the orb forever
---
Wow what a horribly negative and useless comment. It may reflect on its poster but I should hope not.
---
I'm a human warrior using swords specced into Fury.
---
6% hit is my soft cap.
---
I have 2 loadouts.  In the 1st loadout I'm using 3/4 Black dragonscale.  In the 2nd I'm using Truestrike Pauldrons, Cadaverous Armor, and Bloodmail Boots.
---
1st Loadout:
---
-Attack Power: 118
---
-Crit: 2% (Brings my total to 21.8%)
---
-Hit: 1% (Brings my total to 8% hit)
---
2nd Loadout:
---
-Crit: 0.85% (Brings my total to 20.65%)
---
-Hit: 3% (Brings my total to 10% hit)
---
Which one do you guys think is better?  aka, 1.15% crit or 2% hit
---
Swiped Night Reaver off the AH for 99 silver back during launch 😁
---
What it does if you dont mind me asking?
---
Kripp has shown he can pivot.
---
Could always go back to PoE, even if it would pay less.
---
Shh. Horde are supposed to be the bad guys around here. We’re not supposed to mention that alliance do the same thing when they outnumber the horde.
---
Lots of tanks don't bring a War DPS because of loot competition.
---
Hopefully his viewers do too.
---
Nice!
---
Yeah, im not gonna go through the process of all that to prove to some random person that jump runs dont take more than 10minutes a pop.  Just keep doing whatever you are doing. Atleast you arent getting locked out like the rest of us.
---
People play games differently. Let's just put the tl;dr that I got no social life and I play through what I want to, of a game pretty fast compared to Harry with wife, two kids and only 2-4 hours an evening for videogame time.
---
I might say similar things as asmo did if asked, "there's not much left to do at the moment in classic" and I don't mean it as a bad thing honestly. I've done the content I want to do on my main for the current phase and I just log in mostly for the weekly raid(s). And that happens in every game to some level, retail wow, other mmos, mobas, singleplayers games, etc. 
---
I can bitch about wanting more content and that comes from loving the time spent in the game, but I'll settle on finding other things to play. Kinda like Asmo is doing here by moving back to retail.
---
I don't follow asmo actively, so I don't know what the drama in classic is about, but he didn't ask blizzard to add more stuff to classic faster in his post, he stated the reason as to why he's moving away from it. And what more could you expect, he's  a streamer, he would obviously be asked why he's not streaming classic if he suddenly stopped one day. It's pretty normal for streamers and content creators to keep their audiences informed about what their upcoming plans are.
---
Grizzly is just bunch of sweaty pservers.
---
So much pressure on tanks to lead groups, I played vanilla and it was still anxious doing dungeons the first few times.
---
Idk, sounds like you just should have done any sort of research to know what you were getting into.
---
Proof that all Alliance players are 14 y/o
---
Benediction&gt;Halo&gt;T1 bracers are the biggest raid upgrades in current phase.
---
Shard of the scale is an amazing trinket, but normally it goes to resto-shamans first since mp5 is more important to them than priests.
---
Also get the Leggins of Transendence so you can quickly get the 3 piece bonus quickly when BWL comes out
---
The best kept secret: the difficulty of AQ40 and Naxx lies in trash mechanics and respawn rates, not boss encounters ;)
---
Cant wait for AB to be out.
---
Nigma nuts boyyy
---
Be a night elf.
---
That's kind of rude.
---
Uhm, we wanted the game from back then not this mess (referring to sheer server size resulting in thes issues)
---
That's just not true for everyone.
---
I've gone from 53-60 without much trouble, I've even quested in both WPL,EPL, Winterspring and grinded timbermaw rep in Felwood.
---
Sure being a Druid helps with the stealth, and yes I've lost maybe 2 hours to corpse running, but I've done it solo and maybe taken 6-8 hours max Per level.
---
I'm on a pretty 50/50 server(Ashbringer EU) but it's not been as bad as everyones complaining about.
---
Don't attract attention to my sleeper mining zone for when silithus gets crowded. Thanks.
---
Not sure, but I think crit/agi is number one stat because of flurry.
---
Thousands of people line up in a queue on some servers still waiting to get in the game... bg queues will be basically instant for everyone
---
Its pretty chill in silithus. Not a lot of player there, since there is no quests. You can grind mobs in peace.
---
It’s just weird that some of you have never experienced this type of random griefing so I asked her to clarify. This particular session is more insane than average, but this crap happens all the time. 
---
Spy tells me that one particular level 60 mage has killed me 26 times in the last four days. Across multiple zones on both continents. I am worth zero honor. I skin, so never stolen a node, never engaged their alt, but they’ve decided to stalk me. 
---
There are legit creeps who play this game.
---
&gt; The more you camp alliance in the open world and make their life miserable. The more alliance are going to quit.
---
Thats exactly what I want to see.
---
&gt; Are you going to enjoy sitting in 1hour or longer queues for BG's?
---
I play the game for pve (still on pvp server because I am not a crying bitch :D) all I want is to farm naxx and AQ40 later on, pvp is just a fun activity for the time between raids.
---
&gt; The more alliance you make quit the game the longer your queues are going to be for BG's and the less interactive and exciting the world is going to be.
---
More important the more alliance quit the lower our server queue will be and you dont need to log in 5 hours before the raid starts just to be in time for the raid. Will be so much more fun if you can just log on 30min prior, get your DM worldbuffs and raid without having to be afk for hours using your phone to stay online in the game even if you arent at home...
---
&gt; So I hope you feel the tiny honor gains you're getting right now by camping FP's and boats, and cities are worth it.
---
It is worth it and it is a lot of fun being part of multiple raidgroups cleaning the game from leftover alliance. 
---
If you quit everything in your life because it doesnt work in your favor just instantly without even trying you will have a pretty sad one. But thats the "modern casual wow" mentality - what I have to put up some work to get to the dungeon now? I have to find a group to play with? pff naah thats to much to ask for... I just want to log on and have my instant reward and freedom to do what I want...
---
We dont care honestly, even tho we are glad if we make people leave who have a mentality like that.
---
If itll only take 3-10 seconds of course it is.
---
Two hand fury is underrated in vanilla.
---
While I get where you are coming from. Im glad it's broken. What i don't like is the indirect buff this gave rouges. Noticed how there are more in the capital cities now? Yea can pretty much attribute that to the spy nerf
---
I'm not the guy you responded to, but let's just say that I personally value PvP oriented games and want to fight against a thinking character with a person on the other end.
---
Tell me how raiding in retail itches that?
---
No, it just doesn’t give any honor or dishonor.
---
Depends on if you sell portals, you'd usually sell em for 1g to pay for reagents and a bit on top
---
Nerf perception thanks /s
---
His guildies are terrible, and he's terrible at leading and at the game. He's constantly salty.
---
This is about the fourth post I've seen from this moron.
---
I’ll always upvote a dwarf
---
It used to be like that, untill high lvl players brought low lvls with the. To pvp prowls to dishonor their opponents
---
If you already have the mats...get the helm.
---
Sure the mount is probably more useful overall, but those mats suck to get - either buying or farming. Plus, with gold inflation, the mats will be worth more in the future i.e. you will get mroe gold selling them so if you farmed them, you will make more gold farming them again to sell.
---
Also, when you get it crafted, sell it in trade chat for 1,200+ gold to see if anyone is interested - obviously, if it's going in the ah for ~800g (or w/e) then don't bother, just wear it.
---
It's literally one of the best pally weapons forever.
---
I'm horde on Incendius.  Feralas and Ungoro are no fly zones. Nothing but 60 rogues and mages waiting to gank.
---
Read the tool tip....
---
BIG NO to transmog from me.
---
No a one shot in pvp is one attack for their entire health bar. A quick kill is 100-0
---
if you can check the book spawns as well as herb in DM E then that's probably better
---
Yeah most ppl think it's borked. If you were attacking a skull your chance to hit was like 1%. Not according to me, but other ppl that played vanilla.. I have no clue myself
---
Yeah I've heard that the quests on the Horde side don't really have any story to them since they added them second and had run out of time by then. Alliance quests are really well written, especially Duskwood that is always everyone's favorite region. My favorite ended up being a Furbolg questline in Ashenvale, had no idea about that lore and now I feel sad. :(
---
I'm leveling a druid alt and although I spend most of the time in cat form while solo leveling, HoT + bear form has been a lifesaver whenever I pull too many mobs. HoT makes it so much easier to stay alive, my main was a warrior and 2 mobs meant I was deader than dead. Running away is also easier thanks to roots, HoT, feline swiftness or travel form, that has also made it a lot nicer! Compared to warrior, druid really is so much more solo-friendly, only elite quests I need to team up for.
---
Yeah the competition for materials sucks. I've only been able to snatch one black lotus. Guildie was on a long sick leave recovering from an operation and was able to farm them all day. I feel like that's the only way to get any farmable items in the overworld... Sucks to have a job? :P
---
Anyway! Glad you got to experience the journey, have fun in FFXIV. :)
---
&gt; Though it was installed on my hard drive so I didn't actually have to reinstall WoW, just Battle.net and everything else. 
---
So you use basically the same installation as before? I don't even think you know what formatting means, because your hard drive should be fully wiped and not contain a copy of wow (sounds more like a set back of win10).
---
Try to find the reason for the disconnects, blind formatting is a waste of time. Your problem sounds like a wifi problem with a repeater between you and your router.
---
I have neatplates and nug running amongst many other things and that's how it looks like.
---
Go to retail bullying worked. Perfect
---
Yeah that's how I got to watching him and he was really fun and chill to watch too.
---
OP, I hear you, man. I remember when I did Scholo for the first time again in more than 10 fkn years, and the first time ever as a tank. There was this obnoxious rogue (it's almost always been rogues... why?) breathing down my neck "why are you pulling that" "you don't have to do x" "omg tank...". I didn't wipe us or anything, but I was just slow. All my first runs are slow. Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm not l33t enough to instantly click with a new dungeon or raid, but I need time to figure out how I can do the entire dungeon as efficient as I can possibly imagine. 5 runs later, and it're always clean runs of contineous chain pulling, with near perfect synergy between tank, healer and dps, with people often befriending me and recommending to apply to top guilds on my server due to my performance. But I CAN"T FKN WORK with people that expect you to be perfect from the start without any experience.
---
As for the people trying to direct you, I've found that it're always people that want to have their cake and eat it too, i.e. play something other than a tank, but really want to get onto the tank's driver's seat whenever they need a tank for something. If you ever come across such people again, just immediately leave the group. At end of the day, they need you far more than you need them, and you'd do yourself, as well as the tank community, a service by doing so. As WoW simulates a lot of aspects of real life, so there are market forces at play within it. Make use of them by recognizing the value you have as someone that's willing to tank, and use it to get yourself a good experience in this game.
---
Again I share your frustrations with pugs. Here's a read:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhkf0f/lack\_of\_tanks\_in\_dungeon\_pugs\_puggers\_themselves/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhkf0f/lack_of_tanks_in_dungeon_pugs_puggers_themselves/) 
---
Most people in pugs are nice, friendly and patient, but sometimes that doesn't negate the minority that is still a very annoying and present minority, that most of us who've, after a long day at work, sometimes just are tired of to take the gamble of getting grouped with.
---
Not if you make it go the other way, too. You gain honor only fighting players x amount of levels above or below you. Grey players give dishonor, “red” players give nothing etc.
---
Good != toxic. If you've gotten "toxic" behavior from good players, that usually means they told you you're bad and you don't like to hear it.
---
Heteros have issues.
---
Rip, but kinda predictable on such a huge server
---
What an asinine logical fallacy
---
....
---
you didn't really answer it....i mean sure it may slow down but - hypothetically speaking - what's the maximum increase in rank per week?
---
i.e. is it possible (even if it's unlikely) that you can get a max of +2 ranks per week, or is it +3 or +4. OR is the maximum rank increase +1 per week if you are at rank 6 or over (technically possible not actually possible)
---
r/classicwow cared, they've been following him closely at least since the launch. Can't say I've heard about the guy as frequently on r/wow.
---
shamans. they increase the groups damage by about 15-20%, which almost equals a sixth player in that group, but they also heal. shamans are mentally underrated. they are the best class in the game by far when it comes down to numbers
---
I mean... I'm down to go after the Horde players' dudes too
---
My fault then, felt like you were making assumptions based on what I said. It doesn't feel structured like an inquiry but rather a facetious rhetorical.
---
I guess that makes me the presumptuous one.
---
This is really helpful. Any additional info you’d be willing to share on how you decided to map what where would be greatly appreciated.
---
He's saying "interest you in a pint?".
---
As in "can I interest you in a pint of beer?"
---
Spotify is caching
---
replace guild with pre-made.
---
Probe best to log a ticket or go to official forums
---
Could be taking advantage of the noobs who won't have their mounts until 45+.
---
What a nerd.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/60J0Nfy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/60J0Nfy.jpg)
---
This is a really annoying issue. I'm not sure whether or not it existed in vanilla. It's especially obvious when mounted. An entire raid might pop into view so close that you don't even have time to turn around and ride the other way.
---
That doesn't work.. Think about the headlines "local man punches a kid"
---
There have been people solo farming mara and selling the ring for a while.
---
not gonna happen
---
You can log out and do something else for half an hour. They will leave. It's a minor inconvenience.
---
Lol. I wouldn't consider the delusional ravings of a bunch of cultists to proof of anything.
---
It’s the same chat
---
Kinda hard to go in as dps when you took the extra mile and went prot spec :) and yes I am aware that you can tank in other specs as well, but tanking in prot is more enjoyable and a tad sweeter on your healer, who when running pugs prob isn’t geared that great either.
---
Go check out the emerald dreamway portals for a look that is more like an actual stargate.
---
Nice reference
---
It's not pvp when the one side isn't even fighting back...
---
1 2 3 = full rotation
---
This is how I feel being a fire mage... I know I gotta respec for raiding and I know frost is better.. just let me play my way
---
Phase 4/6. Aarthi Basin is still my favourite BG to this day, and I only did a handful of bosses in Naxx back in vanilla.
---
They want to validate their decision. But clearly wish they were on a pvp server.
---
Not if you're making a point with it. :)
---
I've still not had a single epic drop since classic, not one. I've played the game quite a lot, farmed quite a lot etc. It's a little frustrating but hey.
---
To be fair, even at 60, most pugs care little about actually watching their threat. Plenty of rogues and warriors just turn up their cleaves and make it a pain to tank multi mobs. DPS will rarely opt to nuke the non-elites or casters first, instead going for the tankiest mobs in the pack and forcing you to keep up with AoE aggro instead of burning squishy and then pumping high single threat to burn the big one fast. They will constantly open up early while mobs are running, stun mobs and contribute to further rage stravation, and eat the healers mana (this last one I hate a lot since the healer doesnt need to heal me much, but he will burn through a bar healing a rogue or fury war). It also doesnt help too much that if you start to gear up, you get hit less, and with more DPS pulling off you, you get hit even less, and rage starvation becomes a real thing--I think people pulling mobs early and gearing up is partially why people like pal tanks, they come with "full rage" at the start of a fight, regardless of getting hit.
---
MacGyver
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
In classic, class and faction identity are core components of the gameplay. Unless the devs completely abandon vanilla design phylosophy, which they've promised very steadfastly not to, there won't be faction or class changes.
---
You're free to reroll though.
---
Need one shitty wand, he has 100 hp. I know mine crits for twice that.
---
It's hard. If you're a Warrior looking for a tank for your group you get yelled at to "just slap on a shield". If you whisper people in LFG it's usually "sorry, full on Warriors". I'm lucky that my guild's got some overgeared healers with plenty of free time that helped me out, but for a fresh 60 life can be harsh.
---
Ofc, you can find her at goldshire inn
---
I’ve played this game for years, never once on anything but a pvp server because I’m not a pussy,
---
If you’re an aggressive, competitive, type A player you play on a pvp server. Simple as that
---
As someone that mains a healer, but levels a lock on the side, this thread is a roller coaster.
---
Kripp will be even more rich on d4 release.
---
People expect tanks to lead, but at the same time, they will do annoying things. DPS will stick right to the tank as he scouts ahead, even though he will pull back to a spot he said he would. Ranged will fight stuff in melee and drop the threat threshold lower than it needs to be. Open up immediately rather than wait for a pull to set and threat to be established. ETc.
---
They released p2 way too early. Most Non-hardcore people need a few months to reach 60. The hardcore players are now incentivised to kill the players in the lv 50 range.. 
---
P2 (including DM) shouldn't have come out any sooner then late december so it would be roughly 3 months like in original vanilla.
---
Oooh that’s a good point. I hadn’t thought about the spy adding. Good point
---
Horde uses both hands
---
I'm currently leveling 4 alts between 20-30 with a 60 main, and I'm having a problem making sure I don't cap on rested. It's pretty amazing. This is the way to play hahah.
---
It's the one where Khadgar I mean master braetac almost dies honorably.
---
&gt; they have been dominating BRM for at least a week.
---
lol no
---
I prefer Vuhdo, haven't used healbot in a while but they are similar concepts(mouse over healing) Prefer Vuhdo due to the insane amount of customisation options available
---
Why is there someone offline in your party? Does it have something to do with faster resets?
---
It goes for about the price you paid for it, maybe a little more.
---
I don't enjoy it. That means it's not the best time for me.
---
You beat me to it. By no means they should rush content. I will enjoy all the raids but im geniuely looking forward to BC
---
Every tap is a gcd, it’s not really efficient to tap infight unless youre oom
---
If there is no change im quitting the game, p1 ganking was fun and expected. P2 is just a chicken farm
---
Of course Naxx, it will be the most interesting probably only challenging content
---
But it will feel bad farming gear since there's won't be anything after :(
---
reroll on Grob. I did as horde from stalagg and it makes all the difference. Much more enjoyable time leveling and seeing RP events. It does suck cuz I leveled a warrior to 60 but no regrets at all. The community is great
---
Mages that can sheep/hunters that can trap without me having to mark everything saves so much time/effort. Especially if its something like the warlocks in DMN, I can mark each one with a sheep mark, but if I forget or think, "ok, he sees the pattern," I can almost surely expect an un-CC'ed warlock that I now have to deal with. its like, come on man, Ive done this plenty, Ive seen you in LFG doing this plenty, why do I need to give instructions for every little thing?
---
Thunderfury is a clusterfuck even at 3 pm you can’t do shit. Horde fuckin parade around un goro, rebel camp, and tanaris. My main is also 49. Dead on sight. No matter where I go. I just want to have fun leveling but I can’t even do that. I love pvp (I play a rouge) but not this 70:30 fucking ratio. All my irl friends don’t play wow and my guildies are 60 and raising so they don’t have to worry about this shit. Fuck corpse camping. Fuck mages. Fuck horde. Fuck mages. Fuck waiting 2 hours to get into a dungeon just to be softlocked at the entrance. And lastly, fuck mages.
---
Hah, you think they have girls.
---
According to this subreddit or pirated server players, exploits don't exist in this game.  All the bugs are intentional, and exploiting them, ohh I mean using them, is fine.  So this is also fine.  Get good.
---
You can still give a big heal, you don't have to heal them as soon as they drop a bit of health.
---
Clever use of game mechanics
---
What’s the alternative when you have this option? Turning it down would be even more dumb
---
It bothers me way more than I wish it did looking at his slightly off centered unitframes
---
Time to hellfire!
---
This made me lol
---
I’m literally doing this as a 56 priest been doing it since 55.
---
I have about 6300 mana and get by rotating PI and Inner Focus each pack and I have to wait for instance cap a little bit. I have an alt reset me and keep going. I literally can’t do anything out in the world so this is what I’m going to do to 60 for all the reasons you listed above.
---
have you ever watched an asmongold stream?
---
Random number generation.
---
No.  In pvp resistance, hit, defense are normalized.  So your pvp gear should be void of hit or defense.  Resistance beyond base might help I forget.
---
Have you learned the max rank spell? Not much else I can think of.
---
warlocks have crazy hp pools, assuming stamina buff from priest and imp buff, 1 full duration food won’t bring you to full hp. The healer drinks up quicker. Healers not healing locks do nothing but sabotage their own dungeon group and i usually kick them and get a proper healer if they decide to grief.
---
I'm gonna get it and hide sweet rolls in every container of every house u ever enter
---
You need to break up your run-on sentence with a period somewhere. You should check out pserver WSG tournaments- most competitive premades don't bring warriors at all due to mages being more effective with burst, cc, aoe and survivability.
---
You don’t need an elixir
---
Yeah uh I don’t what you on my dude but hardcore rankers are killing anything 48+ if it’s worth honor it’s worth the kill
---
Yes it does, but it gets stale routine, when you need to go BRD/LBRS on your lvl 58 there is no thrill of trying to survive or outsmart your opponents or hope getting lucky along with Alliance raid. No. You know that you gonna be farmed for honor for 4-9 times before you get to the dungeon, because Horde is starving 24/7 to get that 3 Honor from you.
---
Pvp works different than pve it isn't broken.
---
Boi do i have some news for you bgs arent p3 but comming the 10th of dec
---
I'm so tired of this.
---
The tank absolutely doesn't have to lead the group. I used to lead groups on the regular as a hunter in vanilla and in TBC. A paladin healer taught me how to run groups before I started. 
---
People are way too shitty to new tanks.
---
This. I rolled on a pve server specifically because I wanted a casual experience leveling. I didn't want to get ganked, harassed, or camped. Some people really like this element of pvp. I don't. I'm happy to compartmentalize all of that in battlegrounds, but if that's the way you chose to play the game, get your guild to camp you while you quest. That's why guilds are a feature of the game. They help you do things. If you think that's ridiculous and that it's too much effort for too little progress, I agree. That's why I didn't choose a pvp server.
---
Normally the alliance just waits until the horde is in bed before they go gang up on the lvl 48s
---
Sure cc isn't needed for the most part, but it sure as hell makes runs quicker/smoother. Less shit to deal with means fewer resources are being spent which means fewer resources need to be regained which means the party can move faster through dungeons.
---
Meanwhile. I have been 60 for a long ass time. Farmed an epic mount killing Dwarves in BRD and still never seen an epic drop..
---
Gratz!
---
All four of them.
---
Right? I know horde is supposed to be OP on Herod, but my 49 undead rogue can't tell that
---
It's not bad to hold onto. The speed really helps with poison applications, and the proc can be a nice burst. Buuuut... the proc chance is rather low. You ideally also want a high stat offhand, like Widowmaker or Doomforged Straightedge.
---
Is there a way to have a mana bar show up for mana user with the Grid add on?
---
Also, most people seem to think they say "Watch yer back" when you leave. What they in fact say is "*Wash* yer back"
---
It doesn't, because wow isn't a pvp game.
---
There's like 3 people an a fucking hamster working at blizzard on this game atm.  They don't give a FUCK!
---
When you have no spellpower you can just calculate from the tooltip. While leveling it is pretty bad HPM. Maybe with improved renew talent it can become on par with your other spells?
---
Same thing happens when players run out of the bullshit small render distance and die to my dots as a warlock, no honor.
---
Why are they booing him? He's right
---
all correct except lvl 48 gives honor too
---
2 felstrikers! Wow. I've done UBRS like 60+ times seen 3 truestrike (won the second but replaced the same week with nightstalker), one Rend MH (lost), one Rend OH (won) and zero felstrikers... It's doing my nut in!
---
Sick hindsight bias bro
---
It's almost always ideal for tanks to pull because that way initial aggro starts on them and they don't have to start pulls off by trying to gain aggro on each mob
---
Are you DWing? Then probably the set with more hit. Don't take that as gospel though, I'm not an expert in dps math.
---
lol he wants to quit because of drama and stress? After he played through Dark Souls he said he’d never play it again because of the stress he got from his stream turning toxic from telling him how to play the game. 
---
Fast forward and he’s gonna play through Dark Souls 2 in December 😂😂
---
The guy is clueless
---
December 10 ('week of')
---
his true colors are there for 1-2 years now, every since he started to get massivley upset with retail and started "variety" streaming. since then everyone should know he is a complete moron
---
Uou'd get a lot better results from as little as half an hour of a regular excercise schedule with decent diet than this sporadic fucking around but you do you
---
Immersion. Changes the really dated quest text screens
---
As long as you have extra warriors to gear with tank gear, I guess it will still be a cluster fuck.
---
I have a Mini Diablo too! Glad I linked my account even though I didn't play much of retail. Plenty of oooohhhs and aaaahhs all the time. 
---
I just didn't realize how valuable my account was, heh. 10k really?
---
What song is playing?
---
time to sit in scholo/Uber’s/strat for that leveling bis farm

HS was fucked ever since they introduced adventure specific meta defining cards

How does Hunter and Warrior compare to eachother in WPvP? also in BGs or 1v1s
---
Level 60 mages can solo Drakestone and gloves, skipping packs with blink. I'm not sure if 49s can die in range to be eligible for loot.
---
I don't think people thought about how large the servers are compared to vanilla.
---
So if you want the game to not lag like shit you are a casual? lol

This doesn't appear to be a glitch, but certainly an unintended use of game mechanics.

I would AOE that army
---
Bro do you even grind?!
---
Good healers can manage mana enough to handle our taps.
---
Thankfully no.
---
It's pretty much always better to take the stamina. Agility really doesn't scale that well, most of your damage comes from Shadowfang's top end damage and fiery/LS procs. On top of that, Stealth is garbage at 19 and you will be getting kited a lot. (Speaking for rogues specifically here)
---
There are no reload packs, just a recipe 
---
Mortar:Reloaded
---
Which u get when u train the Goblin Mortar.
---
It doesn't teleport you back to town?
---
If you're in an all DPS group maybe, I don't actually know what's more efficient damage wise vs mana regen but if you have a melee dps or two in the group then it's very much worth it.
---
"No thanks that would be unfair, I'll use DKP like the rest of the core members, I want to progress together as a guild"
---
Nelfs as i call them
---
During leveling you can get really fun interactions you just have to find random people, group up (which they'll happily do) and quest together
---
The fact that people who tagged the mob cannot get honor besides those in the duel is the main glitch
---
&gt; I'm on a pretty 50/50 server
---
This is why it's fine for you.
---
Honestly I think people would play a lot better without damage meters. I feel like dps are staring at the meter 90% of the time.
---
I believe in classic u can only enter the instance in ghost form if you died in it.
---
does that work for all of the items? atlas and wowhead are both telling me relic coffers can only give me the hammer of grace
---
Stalagg Alliance. We’re having a much easier time getting rank than the Horde. Hell, we don’t even have to leave Ironforge for honorable kills.
---
Multiple accounts were what I had in mind.
---
Aight
---
Alliance numbers are already plummeting... SW and IF are ghost towns in many high population servers already
---
Really awesome, I particularly like the player and target frames, the big health bar looks very nice. I also really like how you positioned the pet bar above the chat, very tidy.
---
Outside of raids I haven't seen any - I don't think it's that weird, Epics are just super rare
---
Yeah I know, I was only meaning to be satirical, like the post itself was haha. It wouldn’t be good if it wasn’t believable!
---
Yes, like just the 20s first enchanting wand. It would actually be a nightmare to do this because I don't think he will actually get on the great lift with you so you would have to go by the longest route imaginable that goes from Durotar through the Barrens and into Stonetalon and takes Feralas into Thousand Needles. He will not get on the blimp, for example.
---
Not true brother, go try it
---
Imp Ret is great for solo farming.
---
But yes POJ is an excellent talent esp in wpvp now.
---
Tons are doing that though; calling it bad.
---
I mean...let’s be real, asmon and Soda have earned such huge amounts of money, they can just keep playing video games for free for the rest of their lives even without steaming and not give a flying fuck about sponsors.
---
Renew without any +Healing is less mana efficient than Flash Heal is.
---
Max Rank Renew without Imp. Renew is only more mana efficient than Max Rank Greater Heal at about +750 Healing.
---
Downranked Renew starts beating out everything much earlier on.
---
The real answer is "Not always". What spreadsheets often don't account for is that raids have more than 1 healer so Renew is generally a wasted heal on anything not taking continuous damage. Another healer will top off your target before Renew gets even close to full duration and just becomes overhealing.
---
you dont need two accounts.. u log you alt previously grouped you wait 2 min for lead to pass and u reset ez pz
---
Between what levels do these items drop?
---
Not what a meme is.
---
I see a lot of allies complaining about horde but there are a lot of alliance gankers out there to
---
Well, bette than pretending you are experienced and makes errors all the time cause you don't know the place.
---
The point is this isn't some Horde specific issue.
---
I knew it would happen when I rolled on a PVP server.
---
Faerlina seems pretty balanced but if you have real numbers show me please
---
Garbage
---
Much appreciated mate! but im on OCE servers
---
It's unfortunate Blizzard forced all these complainers to roll on a pvp server.
---
he plays like another 6 hours after his stream though
---
Free speech advocate btw.
---
wat
---
Is 7 a lot?
---
No thanks, letting people run up to you unflagged to flag them selves nova and blast wave you to hell is not ideal.
---
Is a Kroll Blade worth 375g? I don't know if I have the mental health to farm the Rend MH.
---
The hamster keeps the servers up with power generated from his wheel
---
And don't be afraid of saying that you are new. We all were new to this game at some point, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
---
&gt;unused BC collectors edition
---
Has a netherwing whelp, not this.
---
Sulfuras is most definitely better in PVP. That proc gives burst and that slower weapon speed plays to SoCommand's strengths.
---
what does that mean?
---
can't be literally wash your back
---
I no lifed it and It took me less than a week to hit 60, but I was playing 10-15hrs a day in that time. You could easily get to 60 in around 2 weeks if you play about 6+ hours a day. If you're only able to play less than 6hrs a day then it's going to take forever to hit 60, but that's nothing to feel bad about. Life does come first
---
What I expected was a pvp server experience similar to what I got when I played vanilla wow, also like the pvp experience I got pre-honor, which I enjoyed (and included some ganking). I did not expect being unable to complete a single quest in less than 4 or 5 hours in any of un'goro, blasted lands, wpl, or epl due to constantly being killed. Does that stasify your curiosity?
---
Do you want it to be?
---
Earth elementals in badlands, dragon whelplings in badlands, dragon whelplings in swamp of sorrows, gorrila's in STV
---
I suppose that's my confusion.  I thought agi scaled crazy well and twinks run around with 40% dodge and 55% crit because of all the agi scaling.
---
I got sent a bunch of bags on my horde hunter, didnt really know why
---
maybe horde are just lads
---
The only time I played "retail" was launch through the beginning of TBC, so I thought I was going back to that by playing classic. Thanks for your advice.
---
Excellent Rets are a special kind of crazy. The kind of crazy I like. 
---
Side note - get that in a woman and you are set.
---
That's not true, flash of light is more mana efficient than Holy light for paladins
---
Well I'm going where the pussy is then
---
Good riddance. 
---
Also, inb4 Advertise kills him repeatedly in retail. Maybe he we get camped enough to quit the game.
---
and i killed probably 1000 lashers at this point and no purples.
---
They didn’t know either
---
These are the 3 I use, follow is a bit... Buggy, you sometimes have to spam it, but I reckon that's just how classic works. I don't have an ability to devour magic, at this point in time I just cba since I mostly use succubi for pvp anyway.

I don't have the patience to try this, but could he be mind controlled via the engineering helmet to follow you onto the blimp? The priest's MC switches away control, but the engineering item turns a humanoid into a pet.

Looking forward to BWL release, I have my 2 bindings on my warrior, I looted the essence of the firelord and I have everything including the arcanite ready to use to get my thunderfury

And even decked out in full epics, his damage was garbage. 
---
Another lock in his recent MC run made a full video about how he cruahed Asmon on the meters even though he waa in questing blues/greens.
---
Funnily enough, that's exactly the time he began to become really popular.

Oh I don't know, play the game like every else and win your loot over time, creating a sense of accomplishment and reward?

Is that grid for your raid frames? Might have to grab that.

Do you really reach all the way to 0 while holding shift for mana tide?

In PVP it's all about burst.

Yeah the male dwarves are telling you to wash your back

Ah damn. That’s a real shame. Didn’t want to have to pick between mortars and my teleport. They’re both so useful!!!
---
Cool, step 1 is to turn off wow lol
---
How dare you imply alluance wasn't outnumbered....
---
learn to play
---
Except that's not how Faerlina is at all
---
Spinal Reaper is by far the best weapon in coordinated PVP for warriors. 
---
Watch a geared warrior with buffs, heals and blessing of freedom chain executing and tell me I'm wrong.
---
If only you had an option to reroll to a less populated server...
---
... oh wait.
---
Warlock flair checks out. Your job is to sit your ass down and make the dungeon go faster for everyone... not stand around waiting to be topped off.

Teleport and a World Enlarger.  :)

It's going to be nice in BG's.
---
Nirmal servers in Eu, are more like 1 mive for 10 people :(
---
1 guild with 10 morons &gt; 10 guilds full of morons
---
They absolutely say 'Watch yer back' as in, "It's dangerous out there, be careful. Watch yer back"
---
You're right. I suppose not everything has been fixed. I should've said most things. I definitely think the ideal WoW is somewhere in between vanilla and BfA.
---
My main was a 49 twink in vanilla :D
---
I feel like I'm reading a zombie story with intelligent zombies bickering over who gets the live human.
---
I really dislike this stance. If you're in a 5 man or even a 10 man and you have both the Mana and a free GCD you should use serpent sting.  
---
There are dead zones in your rotation, where is your not clipping debufs SS with increase damage output.
---
Really nice!
---
Don’t you have to go to a certain area to queue in classic? I kinda remember doing this 15 years ago. Or maybe I just hung out there to duel.
---
Alliance Stalagg is kinda dead right now, and I hope it can recover. Lots of people raidlogging since you can really only PvP right now. Everything else, be it questing, or world farming, or even grouping for a dungeon, is just about too difficult to be worth it. I think releasing honor alone has hurt the community a lot.
---
I really don't leave major cities anymore, I just can't handle playing ghost simulator, whereas AH simulator has always been extremely boring. Loved the game in phase 1, don't have time for rerolling so guess I should just unsub.
---
unlike your mother
---
Gehennas is one of the most balanced servers rn actually.
---
Yes, well fuck you too buddy!
---
Freezing band drops from these? DM E right?
---
P3 because BWL favorite raid. P6 because want to finish naxx after seeing most and never full clearing.
---
&gt;We’re not supposed to mention that alliance do the same thing when they outnumber the horde.
---
They don't, if you're getting camped by alliance while you outnumber them you just suck.  (Except for one particular server).
---
All done. 2h Fury warrior, rank 3, I have finished MC and Onyxia

This one is pretty solid.

---
At some point when you have many addons, you can't place them around the minimap cleanly, without overlapping other things, like the mail icon. I need an addon like the two I mentioned, they remove all minimap buttons, and put them in their own frame, which you can hide.
---
so sick of this dude now, he cries about everything whenever there's the slightest little disadvantage for him... absolutely fucking ridiculous and he will play the victim card to the fullest one second then the next second he is trash talking everyone.
---
previously ive bought into his claim that his is just a "persona" that he puts on but i've now heard him "offstream" and he is even more arrogant off stream than on stream. 
---
guy claims classic is "fucking easy" yet he gets griefed off a server within the span of 2 months and he has had everything served to him on a silver spoon, the amount of time it takes the guy to get full bis may take a year for others. the only reason i would be sad to see him leave classic is that i can't watch this balding crybaby cry about how terrible everyone else in pvp yet he is getting smashed on the daily on and off steam but everyone is a stream sniper.
---
There goes your luck for the rest of absolutely anything.
---
Then why'd some gay ass pvp group kick me for killing a gray (for them) while he was green for me.
---
Jesus, what a bunch of low life pussies
---
Lots of time until. And imo AQ40 challenging too.
---
I got this drop on my mage. I wear it while doing aoe farms. Lots of int and some Stam
---
This makes no sense.
---
So first of all, to write to a log, you have to have something to write.
---
We actually do have access to wows source code, just open it up in IDA, look for where “COMBAT_LOG...” is referenced and we can view the chunk of code that writes it.
---
Now all you have to do is remove listing this. I don’t think addons can view all entities loaded. And most arnt going to use a cheat to cycle entities to retain this function.
---
Anyone reading this can easily show you the snippet of code which controls this. And we could easily make a modification to it.
---
I don’t get why you come across so elitist but are so wrong. I know you write a scripting language to code addons, but is it that hard to think about it more abstract and low level about what actually has to happen?
---
How do you solo Maraudon as Shammy? wasnt aware it was avilable to anyone other than lock and hunter (maybe some others I forget).
---
The title does not ask your question
---
Similar thing has happened to me. It's honestly just a fact that I suck at every instance I run at the first time. On the bright sight you get compliments for being a good tank after a few runs for the very same instance you got blamed for in the first run.
---
I had a good experience yesterday running sunken temple for the first time. The healer took lead and explained me everything.
---
(Not the guy you're replying to) Thanks for this, the novelty of grey wore off for me and I much prefer the world having color while I corpse run.
---
Engineering is a good bet, other than that  improved bof is your only tool. The move/mount speed increase is only good for chasing and tactical retreats
---
You do know cross realm queues are coming with BGs right?
---
Getting to 60 doesn't really help. Most 60s are just as afraid of leaving the cities as the 5xers.
---
Dying your way into dungeons is expected. Don't eben try fighting back, it just wastes some extra Minutes with pointless resistance.
---
People who aren't 60 by now probably should just stop playing at all. This game isn't for you, when you barely can play 1-2 hours per day.
---
You have never been sapped for 45 seconds.
---
but why do they keep telling me to wash my back?
---
that dirty?
---
some dwarf culture or something?
---
Get a group of two other people and go out to 55-60 zones with the intent to pvp. If you get camped by a 10+ group laugh at them for the minuscule honor they get and move to another zone. It becomes very fun when you work with others to fight the opposite faction. Or stay in a major city and have fun.... using the auction house?
---
Best desicion i made in 15 years of WoW is to start char on PvE server.
---
Also probably didn't expect so many mages with lots of AoE compared to vanilla :p
---
The level of the healer is mostly irrelevant since you don't need to worry about weapon skill issues.
---
If you are very low you will pull a lot of extra packs though which is both annoying and dangerous.
---
You are fine for BRD. 55 for lbrs/DM and 58 for strat/scholo/UBRS.
---
PvP servers definitely cater to more of the douchebag elite population. I’ve noticed a big difference between the vanilla PVE realm I was on and the current classic PvP. Barely any RP or goofyness, people are really rude, and min/maxing is turned up to 10.
---
Are you people rly so delusional that you think servers shluld be 100% level 60 players all the time?
---
Yes you can do more than one sword in a fight.
---
What server are you on mate, there are usually more alliance players than mobs on mine and you can’t step into a PvP zone without getting rekt by 10 rogues
---
The wpvp will definitely slow down because people will be honor farming in BG's not in wpvp
---
Then you should be fine once BGs come out.
---
That's why you roll on a PvE server if you want 'real' WPvP to happen. Raids full of 60s around here killing each other in Hillsbrad, just without making any non-60s' lives miserable.
---
Hah, whoops, "for" should be "forge" obviously. My bad.
---
Hopefully I won’t hsve to see his face on the diablo Reddit anytime again either
---
I have tailoring but I wonder why you suggest this? After archmage robe is sucks!
---
Yes but you're missing his original statement, in the waterfall area there are spots where you can die against a wall and be eligible for loot from princess' arena. I was selling rings to level49+50 warriors/hunters with that method for ages.
---
*Laughs in European*
---
Found the heartseeker
---
It’s not a buff when it’s supposed to be that way. There shouldn’t be a buzzer going off every time a rogue presses stealth. You don’t care if it’s fair or not because you agree with it.
---
Been a raid healer main since 2005, and I know what my "job" is. It's not hard to throw a warlock a heal, and healers should do it... but locks should be eating/drinking like everyone else, in the downtime.
---
I generally don't comment about how a lock uses life tap, but in any situation there is too much and there is not enough, and a good warlock who "KnOwS tHeIr JoB" knows this.
---
The best general (pug) advice for a lock from a healer perspective is, try to keep your hp/mp percentages level. You're never going to make everyone happy, because everyone have different preferences. But if you are full life and out of mana, or full mana but an enemy cleave will kill you, there is a life tap management issue.
---
I would say that if you're average at PVP then Warriors have the advantage. Can't speak for talented PVP hunters because I am so far from being one of those.
---
Warriors in particular have a few abilities that will get them close fast and then slow you once they are close. Charge will give you a stun (And if you're travelling with Cheetah then you'll have a stun from that, but if you're aware that they're there then you should be switching out of it anyway). They can also Intercept (Could be wrong but I think it can be used in combat too, as opposed to Charge) and Hamstring. Super annoying for getting distance.
---
If you have distance and start the engagement, then there's several ways you can make sure that you have the opportunity to keep distance. Frost/Freezing traps, concussive shot, scatter shot work well. If you start the engagement then you've also eliminated their ability to charge and you can also open up with an Aimed shot, which is hard to do in combat because of the cast time. I am sure improved versions of the good pvp moves help a bunch too but I have a Raiding talent build so don't have many.
---
We're not putting in the same effort though.
---
Total Chad

Sap is never 45 in PvP. Your add-on is just a custom timer not a blizzard ui function

He's the only one that tries to take asmon down a peg, but he's also toxic af 50% of the time and trolling the rest.
---
I was told that pvp was the real vanilla experience and pve players were missing out on half the game.
---
I've always played pve, but my friends were insistent that pvp was better, so I was willing to give it a try.
---
Was farming elementals in Silithus for Essences. Got two Krol blades from the same mob 2 days apart. Sold them for 300 each
---
Other than the drops pictured, the gray junk they drop vendors for quite a bit, a long with some pricey herbs
---
&gt; You're saying there's more people farming lasher's in DM than there are buying powerball tickets? Hmm, okay.
---
No, I said 
---
&gt; And there's a lot more occurrences of people killing two mobs in a row than there are ticket buyers
---
I understand it was in the second paragraph. I'll try to keep the important stuff near the top next time.
---
Guild rivalries and guilds guarding instances was something people actively talked about wanting with classic. While I see both sides, the drive behind #nochanges included the desire for this to happen, but I don't think those same people expected the factions to be this imbalanced
---
Awesome! I used up all my RNG grabbing Ironfoe on my first classic clear of BRD lol.
---
this is completely untrue
---
Did you use /roll the entire raid that day or just for mageblade? I can see why someone gets angry if loot rules are changed for just one specific item.
---
Ah....actually that's an excellent point I hadn't considered. It would be easy enough to get to FPs safely if all you had to do was corpse run around the continent a little.
---
He’s gonna feel like a retard in t-minus 2 weeks...
---
Lucky dick, 80% of the lashers dont even drop anything when I’m farming
---
&gt; realize that it's hurting the game's reputation and population to have someone pretty important to the scene leave.
---
Private servers worked well and would have run for years if they wouldnt be shut down by activision, and all without asmongold.

You people have to realise he is not the head of warcraft, he is just a nasty troll. If he plays or not, doesnt matter to 99% of the playerbase.

No it’s not rope town and OG would do it at Morgan’s vigil on burning legion.

If you are into WoW (doesn't matter which version) you are automatically a nerd.
---
Dot dot dot life tap drain life "Why is the healer healing me?"
---
this sub is literally r/wow shilling their shitty game. yes vanilla raid mechanics aren’t hard. that’s not the point. and the top dps in vanilla in my case stayed the best, they were the ones who did the research and practiced the execution. Topping the meters in beating the other players.  it’s the same competition in both games - the other players.
---
I haven't even begun to peak!!!
---
Alright man.
---
Bunch of high warlords.
---
The only thing you need is some kind of HealComm.
---
Everything else is just fine with mouse over macros and blizzard frames.
---
We were doing Rag with sub 35, which meant 2 phase, our most recent attempt we had an almost full 40 in raid and 1 phased, which was cool, we had even perfected p2 the previous week, was weird not needing to worry about that
---
Wrong. Imagine being bad and blaming others for being bad because you're too bad to know that they're not bad.
---
He will hunt you to the end of azeroth
---
If they implemented mythic tuned fights in classic, that would be amazing.
---
Im afraid that it would be hard as fuck though, since the average player I've played with here so far, is so fucking bad though. No doubt that around 90% of my guild really does not deserve to set their foot in any mythic raid.
---
God, I can’t believe people like you actually exist.
---
So your solution to the game being completely unplayable for one faction on a server is to completely reroll? Fuck off.
---
But that niche 40-49 twink bracket was pretty popular back in vanilla? Lets say classic wow has an active player base of 5 million and let's say only 1% ever even try lower level BGs; that's still 50,000 to choose from... every single twinking bracket will have queues popping
---
I mean as a counter example the best players in my vanilla guild stayed the best. lots of other great players joined too but the best players weren’t worse cause they’re rotations were easier. the best players new how to theorycraft the best gear and were the best at executing the fights. The competition in raiding has always stayed the same - it’s the other players in the group.
---
Reddit and being irrationally angry, name a better duo.
---
Lol I know right? I’m not seeing OPs point here
---
Cone of Cold.
---
Yes I'm keen for AB, that place is my fave
---
That’s exactly what they’re doing  you fucking moron.
---
They already buffed goblin guards, they should probably do something similar to prevent players jumping on the pier struts to drop guard aggro with regards to terrain exploitation, theramore is particularly bad for it.
---
Well, okay. I've only ever seen rings sold to 60's unless they had stealth. If you can pull that off farming that dagger wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
---
Doubletake cause whatever it can't be that bad.
---
It was!
---
Theres more at level 60 then just raiding if you want it. Especially on a pvp server. Pretty much no pvp actually takes 2 or more hours.
---
It doesnt take a car accident to not be 60 yet. Some people just didnt want to put that time in yet and thats okay. 
---
Its your exact kind of shitty gatekeeping that hurts the health of the community and the game.  Im sure itd be so great to you if all the casuals drop off, and noone new ever signs up again, and activision just pulls the plug on classic rather than deal with a inevitably finished project. Because youre basically saying that leveling is done with and anyone who starts from this point on just shouldnt have.
---
So you are actually asked to specc into something you don’t want to play and deal a lot less dps in order to be given gear you don’t want to have?
---
this data is not old right ?  does it feel 40/60 or its tottaly horde dominant that you cant even get out of a city
---
How? O.o
---
That is Omni Bar. You can pick which cooldowns to show when your opponents use.
---
Well this explains how I'm always hit with something just 0.0001ms after rezzing.
---
Yeah, but 200 viewers is like living on welfare. Though girl streamers make way more with less viewers so it depends.
---
retail players think the 6 buttons they push now instead of the slightly different ones they push in vanilla make raiding way harder because of all the cheesy puzzle party mechanics the developers now throw in.
---
There is a huge difference between those two sentences, by the way. Enjoy your night, and thanks for the downvotes.
---
Not if you're being a passive aggressive cunt who apparently wants no friends.*
---
That is not a glitch, do you even know what a glitch is?
---
And that honestly sounds really clever. Sure, Blizzard can remove it if they bother (Such a minuscule problem that I doubt they care) but it sounds kind of fun and clever tbh

It’s not really impressive, it’s just stacking a bunch of engineering cooldowns together. But that’s WoW for you.
---
Worst part about this is even more people will be using Deathray now. I remember back in vanilla almost no one used engineering much less had deathray.
---
Gratz guys!!! Our guild is quite similar. Well done! 10/10
---
I'm far from an expert but I'd be lost without holy shock.  I mean I can do some decent burst with a judgement of righteousness &gt; holy shock with the spell that guarantees a crit &gt; arcane charge from ungoro since I'm not an engineer which is around 400-500 damage.
---
it takes exactly 2 minutes to swap leader from offline character
---
That still gives honor to the guys who tagged the enemy and who are not in the party. This simply denies other people honor even if they contribute to the kill.
---
DHKs, noob. Everyone downvote this shill
---
Except cross realms means basically no one will have to wait. Also, you have to go to WSG and AV to queue. So this whole post is off.
---
i'm 60 rogue and i almost got rekt by 48 prot pally, he had atleast 3 reflect buffs (thorium spike on shield, blessing of sanctuary and something else) 
---
so i open up on him, im killing killing killing going rogue stuff, he uses stun, heals himself, i do the rogue stuff all over again, he bubbles, heals ... so i do rogue stuff again and then i look at my own health bar, 400HP so i'm like shieet dude, i casts blind on him, bandage myself, he was oom at that point so i finally killed him ... as preraid bis rogue i have less than 3k HP, he as prot pally at 48lvl had similar HP so i have dealed cca 9k dmg to him and almost killed myself with reflect ...
---
Nah points on reddit are better.
---
link?
---
Thanks. Lock has high skill ceiling. &lt;3
---
This was happening to me on classic release, fixed it by disabling/no stalling some addons, I didn’t believe that addons could cause this affects so didn’t investigate for a while, I was wrong.
---
Ive tagged before landing while people do it and I get honor
---
Same boat! It’s a breath of fresh air
---
OP are you ok with getting mindcontrolled and waiting out the timer for honorless target. Because thats what Ive been doing not this duel bullshit.
---
haha thats awesome :)
---
They could be doing that, but don't overestimate them. 
---
Anyway, this bug should really be caught by the automatic tests creates by the programmer who implemented the thing in the first place - or his colleague who did the code review.
---
That’s because they are not in the duel most likely
---
Im horde and rarely leave cities as well on my main due to rankers. That's why I'm lvling a farm alt.
---
&gt; ou people have to realise he is not the head of warcraft,
---
I was watching a few Youtubes today and I really really don't understand what people are doing. If I want to see a "world record MC run", I get plagued with "Asmon reacts to world record MC run". The thumbnail of course is just his face. Same story for most actually interesting searches.
---
Got Krol Blade when questing in the Plaguelands yesterday, was a nice surprise to be sure.
---
The flag way down I dotted the alliance before the priest mced guy died I got honor
---
The best way to stop campers is to switch to a pve server and admit that your expectations of what open world pvp means were romanticized.
---
To shame to admit that.
---
Yesterday I got killed while shortly afk by 2 rogues and camped by them for the next 15 minutes.
---
So what? Not cool. Not fair. Not fun.
---
But the mere fact that this shit can happen makes the open world so much more engaging
---
it's exactly 2 minutes lol....
---
We sure don't! ;) 
---
The thrill of squishing a puny gnome or.. Well anything that moves really, gives us such a boner.
---
You better stay away from the hamster sir. He keeps the servers going.
---
It's less about enhancement being bad after 40, it's more about elemental getting a better skill for leveling than stormstrike. 
---
Personally I stuck to enhancement until mid 50s, was super fine. Only switched to elemental so I can play as a healer in later dungeons if needed
---
Apex who?
---
They do, on any server where the population is flipped, whats the point of your post?
---
is that shrek
---
Depends, minutes? no; Hours, yes.
---
The problem might be in your wording - the efficient thing to do would be to keep questing
---
You must be playing on a really dead server. Your idea of how things are is so very wrong. No matter what zone you go into on Mograine you WILL meet a 8+ man raid within seconds on landing there and you will die. I tried to get into MC last wednesday. Getting there was actually not the problem, because it was lagging so insanely hard I just ran past all the hordes before they even "loaded in" on my screen. I did get teleported 50-100 yards back every now and then but I just kept at it, kept running. I finally got into BRM where they had 100+ hordes waiting, and my game lagged out for a solid 2 minutes, everyone was running in place for legit over 2 minutes without any spell casted, suddenly i hear the sound of about 50,000 spell casts going of at once and im dead. I press release corpse and nothing happens, I press it again a few times and after a few minutes im allowed to start my walk back. I get back and press "Ressurect now" for a few minutes then I jump down into the lava outside the MC "window" where you are supposed to be automatically entered into the dungeon. I get greeted with a message saying "You need to be in a raid group to enter this Dungeon" so I jump around in the lava for about 5 more minutes, then I die again and spawn inside MC. Think it took me in total 30 minutes to get in. And this is how EVERY world pvp battle with more than 70 players is. Every single time, I havent had ONE big fight without insane amounts of lag making it literally unplayable. so FUCK off with your "greatly exaggerated" bullshit
---
And tbh I camp SG kill people as soon as they land. When they Rez I run down and kill them for honor do it 4 times and kill anyone else that’s runs by. The mc duel thing isn’t the problem it’s all you people crying like banning people would fix anything
---
Said by an "obviously not rog" player.
---
This is 100% wrong, at least for leveling. Hots are shit tier healing per mana vs average of normal casts.
---
Or RPPVP, where the real horror happens...
---
Interesting. Maybe dots are a workaround to stop people from getting this much honor using this method. Will test soon since you made me curious.
---
i've had one experience with a tank that seemed new was when i went through WC on an alt of mine. he didn't have much gear and was having a tough time living through stuff so we were going through his gear and was helping him out by enchanting the stuff he had and any tanking gear we found/had that he could use he gave it to him. he even had his weapon break through the dungeon and we were giving him different types of green weapons we had since he didn't have another one. sadly, he hadn't learned any training for the weapons we had so he couldn't use them and he ended up using his mining pick/blacksmithing hammer the rest of it
---
Alliance suck
---
What's a "rog"?
---
It does.  You zone out and spawn on the mob that you qued at
---
go back to retail
---
Not true.
---
Is this you asking for downvotes?
---
Cause that’s how you get them.
---
Yo your welcomed me to join our guild, we will help you out when we can.  Just go to social and type in mutineers in search then whisper someone for a invite and you will be welcome with open arms.  Creating a guild is spendy especially for newer players
---
The first Rogue class quest is to pickpocket him, rewards a very nice dagger for the level (level 10), and he’s neutral so you can pickpocket him. This also means everyone else who’s not a rogue can attack him, because, hey, technical limitations of the time :P
---
Jealous you can’t edit video?
---
I mean as a new player as well, I kinda liked when we had a group that was in experienced doing a dungeon, nobody really knew what to do, and so we kinda just lumbered around killing everything. Sure it wasnt efficient but it was honestly more fun
---
Every raid group need a moonkin to provide that critical strike buff
---
imagine thinking any of what he does is difficult, you can do it in shotcut lol
---
Meh going gnomish just for the tanaris teleport?
---
Your a mage you got portals.. just put your hearthstone there
---
Smart people don't fly to TP or Burning Steppes when they want to go to BRM.
---
What the fuck.
---
This is the exact picture where u can see corrupted Loot Council and loot whore in 1 picture.
---
Why the fuck do you have BRE and then get fucking Rag hammer?
---
It's an interesting part of the dwarven lore, something about their people having lost their wealth long ago. There are dwarven myths about how they used to be so rich they slept on their gold like dragons, but then they lost their wealth whilst fighting wars and being robbed by their enemies. It was during this time that they slept on the dusty and soot covered floors. Their return to wealth was a major focal point of dwarven history, when they had the sway they once had long ago and which allowed them to join the alliance as *equal* members and made them a powerful force to be reckoned with. During this time, it's said that no dwarf slept on a floor ever again. 'Wash yer back' is meant to convey a wish of good fortune to you.
---
That is fair imo.
---
I play on Faerlina. So basically all of the streamers who get gear funneled to them, then sit there and complain that there's not enough content in Classic WoW.
---
Paid character transfers so I can transfer to a PVE server.
---
Done
---
Unless I'm confused about what you're asking, those two things aren't related.
---
I don't think they can spawn from any herb node on the map. Check the [black lotus maps](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-herbalism-best-farming-high-end-herbs#farming-black-lotus), they have a couple of fixed spawn points in high level zones.
---
&gt;As a fellow Alliance, I’m not quite sure why you would be trying to discourage horde to join here?
---
Because he doesn't want them to have the same miserable experience the Alliance flood from.
---
.
---
Hope you are all good man. Everyone has potential even if it doesn’t ring to all around you.  Keep on chugging and find your path The future is yours as long as you open your mind, heart and set some intention.
---
done
---
Problem is that most DPS have absolutely no idea what to actually do. They just click on cruise-control and zone out while mashing buttons until the dungeon is over.
---
deep copypasta man you are enlightened
---
I'm on my level 37 priest right now, 0 Spell power
---
Flash heal: 185mana, 339 to 406 healing, average heal 372.5, heal per mana 2.01
---
Renew: 170mana, 315 healing, average heal 315, heal per mana 1.85
---
Heal: 305mana, 725 to 818 healing, average heal 771.5, heal per mana 2.53
---
As  I said at lower levels it can be beneficial to use big heals and then have periods where you mana regen/wand. when you start adding spell power into the mix then you have to compare different ranks of spells.
---
someone made a site that will show you all this really easily
---
https://www.wowdownrank.com/
---
A way to solve part of this as a tank is to avoid avoidance gearing. Stam / str / crit as prioty stats will help a lot. Proper use of berserker rage will also help a lot.
---
You're a pleb dude. Lol. But nice long answer you wrote there.
---
based
---
**BRD run**
---
'Hey, the mage said he wanted the dreadweavers so he can get the pattern. Come back guys, it'll only take a minute'
---
'Gz man, passing...w-what? Warrior, why'd you roll need?'
---
'I need the gold, also last group rolled need when my stockade pauldrons dropped'
---
**UBRS**
---
'Yo, can we roll the instance for jed?'
---
'Nah bro, it takes too long. Just go'
---
'But I don't need anything except Briarwood Reed here...'
---
'GO GO GO'
---
'Wtf? Where's the priest?'
---
'Outside, looking for another group'
---
I for one welcome the queues going back down to 15 minutes instead of 4 hours.
---
Did you try to take him across the western Orgrimmar bridge? Actually BRB I gotta try this.
---
I relented and downloaded healbot. Its not the same look as the default and to get it close in look and feel is time consuming.
---
It's difficult to navigate the menus but is highly customizable. 
---
I needed to download it because i sometimes couldn't select certain people on the default plates and I also needed healing without targeting allies
---
Autoloot fast. I snagged 6 off shazz last week :)
---
You can get it like this screenshot without addons. You want to have groups together and itll sort them like that and you can turn on class colors and resize the window
---
Unless we are full mana, a warlock wants to sit around 90% hp. While below max hp you take advantage of hp regen as a resource and you leave an open invitation if the healer has mana and wants to HOT you so the party can keep moving.
---
Healers that compulsively top me off hurt my soul.
---
Ive had a group with 2 warlocks once. They would stand there after every group just life tapping down for their healer to heal them back up instead of drinking. They essentially stole gold from the healer. As a tank I told them to stop this bullshit since it would also take more time.
---
Every raid after MC.  
---
MC is cool, but I did that in vanilla. I joined a casual guild and started raiding quite late into vanilla. We got through MC, ZG and the first 2 bosses of BWL before TBC landed. So I would love to have the proper BWL, AQ and Naxx experience. :)  
---
Currently I'm in a guild struggling with Ragnaros and tbh, I don't really mind, this is what it was like back then. You try and try again and then you're so happy when you finally down him.
---
You always know your right when the other side retreats to insulting you.
---
Not as Horde dominant this week as last, though a lot of FP camping and quest giver Camping (Onyxia for instance). Thorium point and Morgan usually have campers as well that abuse the "mind-control to remove honorless target" exploit.
---
However you frequently see alliance groups running around PvPing so areas get cleared from time to time.
---
Quested all day yesterday in eastern and western plaguelands as a level55, and you do get ganked a lot, but not so much that you actually can't progress. I assume it mostly the same for horde &lt;60 players as well that gets discovered by the alliance pvp groups.
---
So all in all its shaping up to be a quite interesting server, though being sub 60 and trying to get your quests done will remain a hassle for both sides for the time being.
---
Wanding does bugger all damage, but does increases threat - a real problem when even after waiting for your tank to loose 3k health you pull 2 mobs off with your first heal.
---
Also, the longer it takes for mobs to die the more healing the healer needs to do and thus you wait on the healer drinking instead of the dps.
---
Yeah naw, fuck it. This shit is cancer and we've already got changes made to vanilla in the form of 1 corpse per person. Might as well remove this garbage. The only people who will be upset by it won't quit the game anyways, they're too busy chasing a "win" to give up now.
---
Please provide a source for your statement that classic doesn't have 5 million players.
---
You can do jump runs with a priest and make fuckloads of gold
---
I'm hooked now... Which one is the "one-spec-fits-all"? 30/0/21?
---
I just typed that... what ever man. I’m an asshole also but I feel you could probably use a hand on your shoulder.
---
I lost my dad not log ago I know how tough life gets...people suck, and the ones we love die or just leave.  
---
But the best part is waking up and remembering I have my self and my music. Anything else is just icing on cement. 
---
Also I just hit 60 today so  I got that goin for me. And that’s pretty nice.
---
The OP actually has brilliant keybindings. Notice how all abilities are bound to keys right in the vincinity of the WASD keys, and then multiplied with modifiers (Ctrl/Shift). I've done the exact same stuff for 10+ years. The OP keybinds.
---
In Retail WoW, I think I had everything from 1-7, ½, Q, E, R, T, Y, F, G, H, J, Z, X, C, V, B and N bound - then with Shift, with Control, and with Shift+Control. So much stuff to bind.
---
Max points you can get in a week is 13k. Your points also decay by 20%. Every rank past 3 is 5k higher than previous rank.
---
So week 1 = 13k = rank 4. Week 2 = 13\*0.8+13 = 23.4k = rank 6. Week 3 = 31.7k = rank 8. Week 4 = 39.2k = rank 9. Week 5 = 44.4k = rank 10. Week 6 = 48.5 = rank 11. Week 7 = 51.8k = rank 12. Week 8 = 54.4k = rank 12.
---
Note that only 0.3% of active players will get over 12k points per week, which is around 10 players on most servers.
---
It used to be both. WoTLK was great for both aspects of the game.
---
Same here, i can forget about getting my Rhok'Delar quest done its just isn't possible on my server, the faction ratio is laughable at this point, you can't enter any 50 + zone without getting corps camped.
---
And BG's won't fix this..
---
If this continues i might as well quit and try a TBC private server!
---
Damn, I just found this post and the site is down. I sadly dont know how to locally host a site, but would be willing to do so. What I want to do is to show that I am a fire mage on my mage, and show that I am a shadow priest on my priest. I played around with changing a line in the gears.lua file to  
---
&gt;tinsert (talentsSelected, {iconTexture, maxRank, tier, column, i, specID, maxRank})  
---
using maxRank instead of rank, and starting the for loop  
---
&gt;for i = 3, (MAX_TALENT_TABS or 3) do  
---
at i = 3. This makes it look like I am deep shadow as my priest and deep frost for my mage. However when I go on my mage, and change the for loop line to  
---
&gt;for i = 2, (MAX_TALENT_TABS or 2) do  
---
 in order to get deep fire, no one seems to be able to see my spec. Any help would be appreciated. Also for some reason, I cannot find out where the GetTalentTabInfo function is defined.
---
Sadly, people with this mindset are running the world.
---
Done, but i have no pvp rank.
---
This is called "getting your dick kissed"
---
Ferelas. Camp Mojache to DM there’s a bottleneck near bridge.
---
New youtube video: how to make 600g/hr doing lashers.
---
I doubt it. 99% of the pvp I see comes from AFK, Crusade, Soverign, and a few other guilds. I almost never see olympus guilds in the wild pvping besides maybe a few at the Tarren Mill Mage farm which seems to have let up.
---
IDK what olympus does but it sure isn't pvp.
---
Not on alliance it isn't. Straight dogshit, and the logs prove it.
---
PvP as a whole is very time consuming if you wanna rank up. And you'd need an organized effort to do so.
---
It's not as time consuming as the epic set, but it is a heavy time investment.
---
&gt;SW and IF are ghost towns
---
Exactly as they should be. Everybody is out pvping and not afking in IF.
---
There is no point in running prot spec anywhere in the game... you are basically handicapping yourself with it... I guess you also stack defense ?
---
Their price has went up considerably since bgs were announced.
---
31/20/0 or 30/21/0 is the standard pve/pvp holy paladin spec. But this is a pure healer spec.
---
Hunters are pretty much dead, once you've closed the gap, you need repentance, mount, swiftness potion, rocket helmet, rocket boots or skull of impending doom to close the gap though.
---
The speed increase in the ret tree is irrelevant. Enchant your boots with +move speed. The talent doesn't stack, so all this talent allows you to do is put a different enchantment on your boots and forego using carrot/spurs/mount speed enchantment. It's a very nice bonus, but it's not worth speccing for.
---
A holy/ret spec is generally very bad for pvp, as you miss key prot talents.
---
Because he doesn't want to start shit.
---
His gross greasy face at that too.
---
I think you missed the point of his post. He does not want to do the part where he "gets camped by a 10+ group and laughs at them." Most people don't.
---
Same.
---
&gt;Horde flair
---
If I lose a brutality blade to some guy who can't be bothered to farm dal'rends, then I'm pissed.  Don't be that guy OP.
---
see thats kinda my thoughts. This is an alt, which I plan on playing and having fun with....but cant justify paying 90g for 20% increase in speed. Will just hold off I think.
---
As paying subscribers, we are *literally* *entitled* to a working server.
---
Is prot pala viable for raiding? Is Boomkin viable for raiding? Is arcane viable for raiding? 
---
I think subtlety goes under the same topic.  Sorry :/
---
Typical insecure undead, nothing new to see sadly
---
Dude it's  not catering  to streamers, but even if that is what you understand  then so be it. Streamers are the face of every  game, they are not random players - they are showmen who promote  the game and help people  know what is going  on.
---
I don't agree  with 75% of things Asmon said or did but he helped  me personally understand  classic and parts of retail I missed since Cata. He was and is  not a bad guy, he just has a strong  opinion  and stands up for himself. Today  we need more people  like that, is what I think.
---
Doesn’t matter if in grp or not btw xp is count on how much %dmg you Deal to the mob
---
Didnt they literally roll horde - gehennas to fight APES? Or am I mistaking them with someone else?
---
I am not honestly sure how many of us are jumping, At the moment it seems to be about 10 - 15 of our core raid team, But we were planning to make the call tonight. 
---
Some of us are just fed up with not being able to play at all due to the 20 v 1 gankfest.
---
pretty sure these are the worst 2 epics at that level you can get
---
0/2 t2 mage reporting in.
---
Report him.
---
China = Asia ?
---
Nom-Rogues
---
What time f you lose it to one that has krol blade?
---
I feel your frustrations as well.  
---
Trying to quest is futile. People are camping choke points where they know solo players will come. They outrank you or they have twinked already. They wait till your half health or less and then pounce.  
---
Time to take yourself down to a low level area and pass the frustrations on to someone else.  
---
Maybe a /sorry instead or a /spit or /laugh as you destroy them.
---
What is he using to deal so much dmg? And is it possible to do as a mage? asking for a friend!
---
Funny because it’s actually just this
---
I'm probably more into 0/22/29 for the melee oriented playstyle...
---
And what would he do in retail? 8.2. came out 5 months ago, pretty sure, there is nothing to do in retail as well besides transmog/mount competitions.
---
You can exp farm Mara as a frost mage until lvl 53-54
---
Mc and onus is will become obsolete during classic.
---
Grid2 comes with libhealcomm 4.0 so you don't even need HealComm with it.
---
Thats true, mines is for elemental / resto.
---
In the future, pvpers don't be roaming around looking for hold kills because they will get more honor from doing battlegrounds, which you can only queue for in major cities.
---
Sure they can queue then go out and roam, but why would they do that when they would have to fly all the way back to requeue after their bg is over?
---
How much I pay consideration to the healer's mana as a tank depends greatly on how geared and leveled I am for the content.
---
If I'm 26 doing SFK with good gear, I usually won't even look at the healer's mana and it won't be a problem. But if I'm 53 in BRD and still gearing, I'd be stopping to check if they wanna drink every 2 pulls or so.
---
For 60 dungeons we usually stop every 4 pulls or so for drinking if the healer is alright. Sometimes not even that.
---
Bake him away toys.
---
your\*
---
Saw double epic in just a normal dm run, krol and tank ring. Not as rare as one would expect.
---
You can do Mara until 53-54 as a mage. Very good exp, not so much gold, but decent.
---
well arcane is the main raiding specc :D
---
Hard time for us warlocks when we hellfire
---
 ''How dare you play less than ME ? Are you telling me YOU HAVE A LIFE ? is that WHY you AREN'T 60 yet ? Cause you have FUCKEN THINGS to do rl ? Fuck you I'm more skilled, I already can suck my own cock but you offended me by being alive so now I have to camp you''
---
Epic mount possibly.
---
That’s horde for you. Exploiting losers who can’t pvp fairly or the right way
---
You contribute to the other melees, but your own damage will suffer in difference to a PvE spec.
---
I see I got an upvote, can't tell if it was you who upvoted or not :p
---
I was actually kidding, the phrase IS 'watch your back'. The guy who made the post you're replying to was just joking :p
---
What a waste.
---
Get the helm.
---
The mount isn't as important as people make it out to be. It's more of a milestone. But the helm is a solid and noticeable upgrade.
---
Yeah, same. Tanaris and especially Gadgetzan are basically a no-go areas for Horde on my server. Atleast in Everlook it's kinda even and switches hands a lot, probably due to the vicinity to Orgrimmar.
---
Over watch came out in 2016. There has been expansions and update to all their games consistently. The last WOW patch was a few days ago. 
---
The money they spent on this is easy money because although 90% of the population won’t buy this, the 10% that would, will spend crazy money. Pretty easy win for the community/marketing team. It’s not like the game devs have spent time on this so no development time has been lost.
---
That's actually a plausible idea. For some reason I doubt it. Its like a hard-coded behavior that you can't take pve mobs onto scripted moving objects in the open world.
---
December 10th can't come soon enough...
---
Cheap Shot Not great? Dafuq...  how can killing green mobs in stunlock or putting yellow mobs to 50% in stunlock not ne great? With cs and ks u get close to no dmg from mobs equal ur level... i feel like biggest Point for melees is having Good gear while leveling. Getting the swords mentioned and that sweet agi gear makes u do tons of dmg while evading so much AA
---
Took me 10 days played. But I wasn't following a guide or so. Just using Questie.
---
I think on average it's 8 days played or so.
---
There is also a warlock who did 1300 but didnt get his shadow wrath OH
---
Arcane is literally the main raiding spec 😂😂😂😂 top dps mages are arcane. Frost mages are made for farming and AoE
---
Can i have it?
---
That's what happened on private servers...
---
You are leaking some "yikes" and its seeping into my day. Please remove yourself from this planet.
---
Just waiting for this shitty classic beta to be done /s
---
(But not really, this shit is scuffed)
---
To be fair, could've been Stonerender Gauntlets, Lei of Lilies, Ring of Saviors, or Taran Icebreaker.
---
Not even 50-59, I'm 45 and in tanaris killing the wastewater bandits I would get 2 kills and then people would come by and kill me. I can't do anything about it. No joke it happened 4 times and I had 7 out of the 20 kills I needed for the quest and I spent more time doing death runs than actually playing the game. This just isn't fun.
---
The census addon got killed by blizz tho, where are these numbers from?
---
I just do instances, it gets a bit repetitive sometimes but the xp tend to be better with a decent group, and great loot of course
---
I'm on the same server, horde side and I completely understand what you mean. World pvp is a toxic shitshow right now and it sucks.
---
I hope it doesn't take that long because Hearthstone is so boring right now that not even Battlegrounds can save it.
---
The nice thing about druids is they can throw a lowrank hot pretty early in the pull, as long as the tank has gotten atleast a demo shout up.
---
Speaking as warrior tank, and former resto druid.
---
You chose a pvp server....
---
You can additionally ask help from a friend, switch to another zone, level in instances. You did none of those and instead cried for attention on plebbit.
---
Guild leaders taking raid items n giving it to friends ,  i left my guold  after 6 weeks cos fuck retail guilds coming to classic with loot council

Flight paths and boats being camped by horde for a month. Entire guild raid logging until bgs. Wonder what the appropriate image would be for that.
---
Better get leatrix map addon it safes u about 4bucks
---
Does mediocre dps and takes up a debuff slot.

Thank God. Hope he takes all of his twitchzoomer fans with him.

"Probably a year from now at least" is what they said.

gross
---
I have (apparently) a different printing, and this item is supposed to be "1 teaspoon each of cocoa of cinnamon." Very different!
---
That "yt hack" puts more effort into bringing laughs and joy to others for no true gain to his own person than I bet you ever have in your entire life.
---
Only a miserable sack of shit would look at a harmless meme made by someone else and have this kind of reaction to it. Get some help
---
What „gank issue“ are you talking about?
---
That’s called world pvp and if you don’t like it you should have picked a pve server.
---
You'll die.
---
The same way as warlock, but with flame shock instead of dots :) takes a long time though for stuff like princess. Best to just run around gathering mushrooms, bindweed and mithril.
---
I'm playing NA east servers from the UK since you can't transfer different regions, I did find that out before classic dropped thankfully.
---
&gt; Is the Subtlety spec viable for raiding? I saw a PvE talent buid on the warcrafttavern website but i don't know if it's worth it (i want to do PvP and PvE aswell, that's why i'm considering using a Subtlety build).
---
&gt; The website says the Hemorrhage is useful for the raid because it increases the (physical) raid damage.
---
As pointed out by Caperfin in the comment section of the guide. Your main use or function comes from applying Improve Expose armor.
---
Clear dichotomy:
---
""Being a good tank isn't about mitigating damage"."
---
"Tanks are chosen for their damage mitigation but their primary focus lies with threat generation. Where am I wrong here?"
---
I don't know why I keep replying, but you're a fucken annoying troll. :)
---
Nice
---
You have to get Krol or Dal because it can take weeks or months before you replace them since there’s only 2 raid swords in the game, both with a stupidly low drop rate. and every single Warrior and Rogue wants them.
---
You need to be in a raid group I think, but yeah
---
A guildie of mine deleted his because he thought it was worthless and wanted an extra bagslot
---
35 rogue and can kill fresh level 60 clothies that have just leveled or have very little gear.
---
Is it just me that sees Chromie Classic Release in this picture?
---
I picked undead to get that cannibalize racial. Mostly for leveling, but it has been useful in dungeons as well.
---
5 level below max, imo, and reduce the honor gained in groups to incentivize 1v1's or 2v2
---
&gt; At this point cross-realm BG's could be anywhere from about 50k to 500k players across connected realms, but definitely nowhere near 5 million.
---
That seems reasonable. But even if it's 500k. You have a lot of players who have
---
1. no interest in PvP at all
---
2. people who have an interest in PvP at level 60
---
3. people who are still leveling and might go into a BG here and there
---
4. people who want to stay on a lower level to play low level BGs
---
The fourth group is tiny compared to the whole playerbase. The question now is how big is the third group going to be and how big will it be once people realize that it's not fun to go into BGs with those pvp twinks who crush you.
---
Why did you buy it when the atlas addon is free?^/s
---
The ganking issues that people are experiencing on 70/30 servers.
---
I will run as a tank and give all greens to the guild disenchanter, the catch? Never paid for any of my enchants. I think your in the right tbh.
---
Even in p2?
---
every time something happens that this community as a whole says is bad that he does theirs at least 2 posts about it with people bitching about him with 20k upvotes and 1k comments
---
SexyMap usually allows you to completly hide minimap buttons or only show them on hover.
---
The solution to fix this issue is, play on a PvE server.
---
People choose to play on a pvp server for whatever reason and now they have to deal with the consequences.
---
Yeah, rouges.
---
Yeah even 5 leveles is huge
---
Yes I meant they can spawn from any node where they are known to spawn. Meaning they could spawn in the same place twice in a row. I wasn't clear enough.
---
How come every single mage is frost then right now?
---
Heal them just enough, so the next aoe from a mob kills them not their own hellfire. That should increase the learning effect.
---
Once you are geared, it also helps to just not equip a shield. As long as your healer can keep up with the damage, the best thing to keep aggro vs. cleaving and bombing DPS is to beat them in their own game. I play two-handed fury, and when tanking a 5 man instance, I just switch my leather DPS gear to plate and cleave as hard as I can. This obviously requires some experience and a healer who is also somewhat geared.
---
Cool, after 3 months classic is finished for me
---
On Fairbanks Silithus is like the 2nd most dangerous zone in the game for alliance second only to SG.
---
Blows my mind that I wanted to comment these exact same write
---
Money can sure as fuck alleviate the stress that comes from not having any, though.
---
This isnt a thing xD
---
Hi  
---
I've seen a lot of discussion about this dagger on the priest classic discord (shadow priest), and people are a bit unsure of the mechanics. So if you want to talk to people that know a lot of about this dagger go to the discord and ask in the shadow priest pve section :D. 
---
I'm personally not 100% sure how blizzard works, but I don't think the dagger will proc on mind flay ticks which is the best resemblance i can make.
---
But i will say It is extremely rare and people have been farming it for month, without success! So chances of you getting it is very very low.
---
aoe never affected people tagged with pvp when you are not
---
In this case it's best to get everybody to abuse the bug so Blizzard can address it for getting out of hand.
---
buy powerlevel
---
I cleared everything up to Rend with mage, hunter, rogue and 2 warriors.
---
&gt;this is how you lose players
---
...By letting them roll on PVP servers?
---
No, just stop playing not worth even trying
---
ok, tell us whats a better staff than staff of dominance for casters in current phase
---
My Female Tauren sometimes does a Earthshock Animation for whirlwind / windfury / Hoj procs etc.
---
It's the new server side population control.
---
Epic battles over farming spots, raids on cities and contesting world bosses were the main reason I loved pvp servers back in the day. Not  farming honor by ganking lowbies 24/7 in an attempt to rank up.
---
First issue is you are fury.  Fury needs more globals to do any damage at all - and you dont get many globals as a warrior against a mage. 
---
Secondly. Youll NEED consumes to have a chance at beating a mage as a warrior.  Iron nade, FAP/Resto-pot, frost reflector to mention afew.  
---
Warrior is without any dicussion the WORST 1v1 class. But the strongest with a healer/dispeller behind him.  Classic isnt a solo game.  So dont feel bad or discouraged when losing most 1v1s as a warrior. 
---
And dont compare yourself to players like monkeynews who is one of the best warriors in classic. 
---
Instead, watch clips of people like Monkeynews, maitoz, zulpi and tribe, see what they do and duel a lot to learn.
---
Im confused as to what people thought it would be like on a PVP server? if you dont want to get ganked by somebody twice your level play on a PVE
---
NAX
---
Mark a skull on a caster. Charge the melee targets and aggro them while the dps nuke the skull. For all melee groups mark a skull and charge it, aggro everything then taunt skull which should hold aggro for dots/cleave/healer. The dps will pull aggro and that is something you need to be okay with. Melee dps can typically take a few hits without worry.. mages/hunters can kite.. locks typically only pull aggro on the boss.
---
I mean that's clever use of priest mechanics but the problem here is nobody else can get honor except the two guys dueling (priest and warrior in this case)
---
There’s two types of players, rogues and rouges.
---
Our priests had a similar setup with the eye. They established an order early to avoid people getting butthurt. One guy got butthurt anyway, threw a tiny fit the first time and people quickly forgot about it. Called us a corrupt loot council and left the raid right before we pulled Ragnaros the following week. And because he's been here for a while or some shit, he was allowed to raid again after a public apology, but got his position in the loot order pushed back as a punishment. He couldn't take it anymore when a third eye dropped in three consecutive weeks and finally quit the guild on his own.
---
Now he's prolly looking for a guild and climbing his way up as a newbie when he would have gotten his precious benediction as early as week 3.
---
Aq40 Appart c’thun maybe... and that’s debatable
---
Mam ofcourse their community leaves the second He is out, Alliance there is also holding bec. of Him. Unlucky on Shazzah (EU) we have nobody like that, alliance is death, horde can even rank up -nobody to farm on xd
---
Lei of lilies is actually really underrated
---
Seriously, it can't be that much better than thrash blade. Sell it. You will be slightly less optimal, but you'll be that much closer to your epic mount.
---
Why spend 15+ minutes running from another zone and then still die in front of BRM? Not quite sure which path you're talking about that doesn't have roaming 60s either.
---
If its prime time you just fly to TP expecting to die, then you just die all the way to the dungeon. Still only takes around 30 minutes while you watch netflix.  Not like dying cost you anything either.
---
Or, like last Friday morning, I logged on, ran to LBRS with 0 deaths, and could start the dungeon immediately with my friends when I logged on in the evening.
---
I see allies in Feralas, Tanaris, Un'Goro and the Plaguelands.
---
I´m assuming ur talking about the dog packs.
---
This is how i do it (it works for me, not the fastest way but fast enough and with zero chances to die): i agroo each pack one by one up to the entrance and clear them there.
---
ive stopped trying to do all packs at once cuzz for me the jump only worked like 25% of the times. i could b doing something wrong tho, but the way i do it works for me.

That offhand is just not worth the time investment vs all the other things you could be doing. 7 extra spell dmg that takes 1300 runs vs spending that time farming gold efficiently,  getting every other piece of gear, etc etc. Cuz once AV comes out the dude who did everything else instead of waste their time getting that offhand is going to  be ahead of the guy who had 7 more spell power in one school of magic.
---
Yes my Rogue will do this cast animation for Instant poison. There's a lot of weird animation stuff going on with Instant Poison/WF/My sick front flip animation.
---
Nope
---
We used to Q in uc and gank western plaguelands tho
---
If you have flurry axe, its flurry axe doing it.
---
Mograine is okay m8. I had the time of my life pvping yesterday with 3-4 other guildies (I'm a healer). I got like 200 kills, always fair interesting fights(13k honor). If some 20 man horde group showed up we just changed zones. We had some crazy 4v5 4v6 that we sometimes won sometimes lost. Overall fun. And we dont try hard with engineering and consumables.  It's not unplayable if you are aware of your surroundings and use your team at everyone's advantage (high ground, guerilla warfare, terrain usage).
---
rogue here! 100% worth, got mine for 315g.
---
Girls? 99% of hord players are actually virgins. Allys are the real chads
---
Judging by the comments all u fucks are horde on dominated servers
---
Which class between Warrior/Warlock/Priest would be the most efficient for selling SM Lib/Armory/Cath boosts?
---
Is kripp toxic? I’m ootl:o
---
ElvUI uses HealComm I think.
---
I wouldn't take the risk to use those service, its expensive and you can end up with nothing or with the ban hammer.
---
Your best bet is probably to find a hidden spot without much quest and grind mobs here or wait until 10 December.
---
For instance on my server when Azuregos isn't up, the temple in azshara is quite empty and you can actually loot golden pearl here. Not sure about your level tho
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Ive reported a hunter farming bot on ten-storms server over 50 times and its still sat in silithus farming 24/7 for atleast the last month.... thousands of illegal gold in the system because of one bot.
---
I’m not gonna lie I’m lvl 51 and holy fuck I can’t level I can’t go anywhere and quest ally either wait for me to be below 10% health and kill me or I get attacked by 5 60s and body camped repeatedly.
---
What’s AV?
---
You have to queue up to BGs at the battle master inside the major cities. After the BG is done the whole group spawns back at the battle masters. If the Horde have a long BG queue they could still fly to Felwood and WS from Orgrimmar but camping the wetlands boat is too far away time wise. Also since most alliance players will be in BGs there will only be farmers and levelers for the horde to kill in the world.
---
this is how you lose players? bye then i guess
---
I’m not denying the duel trick, just pointing out something else that should be fixed.
---
Evening 6pm+. Post it during your own play time for 2h, then repost it.
---
For cheap stuff you can repost it before you log of for 24h. This way you have minimal cost, are typically one of the cheapest and cover the most important times.
---
I was part of the group that killed him, from that youtube clip, and the lag was the only reason our raid was able to keep aggro on the boss. Your raid came like 10 minutes after we tagged him and it all went to shit then. The lag was creeping ass soon as you guys charged down from that hill. There were 6 raids at least there, both alliance and horde.
---
Alrerac Valley. You can purchase off hands from the AV vendors at exalted rep that are really good. Around 34 spell power.
---
&gt;Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60  in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think  I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me  fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand  viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on  this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.

Killing them is worth it, campin them def isn't
---
Since P2 on Razorgore I haven't been able to do anything. If I want to dungeon I have to put aside 3 hours for one. So I just don't log on unless it's raid night.
---
I love my guild and what I've done already, but holy fuck I wish I was on PvE. This is not how it worked back in Vanilla. This decision to let 5x the amount of players on a server is the dumbest god-damn choice.
---
Yeah loads of people stopped logging in. 20 Vs 1 is really just.. boring.
---
How is the xp?
---
Need advice from Main Tanks that already have experience raiding Onyxia and Ragnaros.
---
I am a Troll Tank and need to know the gear set. Do I have to go full Fire Resistance Set sacrificing Hit Chance or should be mix with a FR and Hit Chance (Minimum) ?
---
Mediocore it's enough for me, thanks for the information!
---
Given where they are all standing I would be 0% surprised if it is a raid or two waiting for ony buff to drop ...
---
None. Just mouse over macros. #1 healer most of the time.
---
In before Rule 7
---
Desperate to pretend people havent just given up logging in because sitting in your capital is full as dishwater.
---
Try a different class. First class i tried was a hunter back in vanilla cuz i thought the pet taming was cool. Didnt like it and tried a rogue. It was hard but stealth was fun, and so was getting up close and personal. Ive mained rogues since, on bc, wrath, cata, pandaria &amp; legion. I got lucky to find the class i liked most on my second go. Try some of the other ones and see what you like. Maybe healers or tanks are more up your alley. The role youl play in pve groups will stick with you forever, think on what role interests you as well. Maybe youre meant to be a warlock, or a shaman, who knows.
---
nice to se you guys back
---
lets see if i can find the time
---
Loneshark 😊
---
They thought it would have the same population as 2005. Not 5 times the amount of players.
---
And NO ONE can argue you could have seen that coming.
---
I want this web design to came out again ...
---
Wtf is that instance anyway?
---
Joined a group randomly to make food and water for a warlock doing jed runs for the 78th time or so. Decided to tag along. We got jed and he dropped reed. I needed and won. First time in ubrs.  Great trinket.
---
Or we alliance guys werent stupid enough to pick a pvp server like you did :D
---
It was crystal clear what would happen but if you cant think ahead... face the consequences
---
I fly to hinterlands when going to wpl/epl and lakeshire when going to brm. Takes a few minutes more but is worth it to avoid feeding honor to assholes. Of course, it doesn't always work, there are always roaming squads, but usually it's way better. I get there with less deaths, anyway.
---
Oh, i didn't read the comments, thanks for the information!
---
Got my hands on Hand of Edward the Odd, what is a fair price to ask for it? Should I hold on to it for a while as it may be valuable in battlegrounds?
---
This is the craziest shit I've ever seen. And I tell you, I've seen some crazy things.
---
well done.
---
Probably Warlock but generally speaking a Mage or Paladin would double the speeds of these classes. Mages can pull the entire Cathedral by attack the boss, ice block, nova then AoE the entire room down.
---
Paladins can do the same by pulling the boss, bubbling, using consecration with Retribution Aura on and letting the mobs beat themselves to death. The combination of that any items such as Skullflame Shield with causes damage upon being attacked makes Paladins untouchable in Cathedral
---
Thank you omg hahah
---
If you guys can do domo efficiently, rag will die soon after, keep it up!
---
all these flavours yet you chose to be salty
---
Asmongold famously said "Mythic Azshara has probably more raid mechanics then the entire ICC".
---
Its called "cutting edge" raiding for a reason now. stand one yard to far on that fight and you are dead. Its one of the most challenging thinks I have ever done in gaming.
---
is that a staff?
---
&gt; just took all the epics
---
Not that I like him or anything, but that was literally the point of the raid and everyone knew it beforehand.
---
This sub is getting more and more cancerous by the day. Kinda ironic, considering lots of comments on here are very similar or even worse than Twitch chat.
---
Pvp the right way huh? Go do your homework buddy
---
Can someone elaborate how come I have miss on my hit table for yellow damage with these stats ?
---
Lei of lilies is pretty good actually. And Taran is good on paladins.
---
It's the best weapon you can possibly get right now, I mean what else are you waiting for...? :p
---
Is it worth farming those mobs only or just when you do jump runs?
---
Yea leveling pvp maybe.
---
Most 60 pvp is done as MM and some survival.
---
And while hunter is a very good pvp class, the skill ceiling is a lot higher compared to other strong pvp classes like rogue, mage and warlock.
---
i love that they made gamon a character in a raid
---
Probably in shock from getting his ass handed to him by what should have been a free kill.
---
Well holy crap, now my chili is incomplete and my day is ruined.
---
Just kidding, I'll still enjoy finishing the leftovers, but next time I'll DEFINITELY try it with cocoa and cinnamon! Thank you for clearing this out!
---
The best raid spec is 31/0/20, but they do mainly spam Frostbolt.
---
It's almost like none of you guys are aware that these are fictional personalities, so-called "streamer personalities".. You do know they aren't anything like this in real life, right? Im having some serious doubts when reading threads like this.
---
McConnel isn't "trying to take Asmon down" he is his friend. His character on stream sometimes shits on Asmons character because he is exactly that, a *character* who is sometimes obnoxious and arrogant and stubborn. And McConnells character is sometimes that of being a bitch, to say it outright. A whiny bitch. Sometimes he's a cool collected guy, even downright funny especially when talking politics, and sometimes he's hurt and whiny. It's all part of the show and you guys seem to just walk right in there.
---
Watch some of Asmons videos on his "real" YouTube channel if you don't belive me, he's a totally different guy when he's not streaming. Im not saying you have to like him, thats totally up to you, but making it sound like Asmon and McCool are the same on stream as in real life is beyond stupid.
---
Even when you don't have a HOT on you you still shouldn't be at 100%  health if your mana isn't at 100% as well.
---
Reroll arms gnome war with engi
---
Well just like the old wow videos with a million lvl 1 gnomes runnin around. Think if these groups would start runnin around beating people up and all would be dishonorable kills.
---
if i get 2 hordes in melee range. as a hunter what am i suppose to do. i cant run away i might aswell await death
---
I'll have to come back to this one when I get home, cheers mate!
---
Playing Alliance will do that to you.
---
Because in vanilla you cant actually cap your hitrating, youll always have 1% chance to miss
---
Interestingly, the sim says the one with more hit
---
my shaman dares me to try to kill myself and gets mad if i dont life tap

Ye but 7.5%?
---
Bwl will probably be the limit for most casuals.  Aq40 requires 2 stacks of nature and shadow pots each, and thats if you dont wipe.  Most people dont want to farm that much and lose interest when the good players realize they are carrying the bad players.  Aq40 is not something you just waltz into.  On top of that, youre still farming mc and bwl and zgs.
---
Bosses have 5.6% chance to dodge, looks like you just got unlucky and it was closer to 7%.
---
Rng is rng
---
What do you mean? Are you saying you expected to be able to reach a 100% chance of hitting? If so, this is not possible
---
I do love it as a flavor item tbh.
---
No. We KNEW they were going to be overpopulated. But we didnt know Blizzard would increase the server caps by FIVE TIMES the amount of players. We just thought the queues would be crazy unless they opened more servers.
---
I thought hit capping removed misses from the hit table for yellow damage. White damage being another story
---
Just watch it next to your wow window: I mean I am speaking from experience, this is how I have leveled by running every dungeon at least once (aside from stockades and deadmines) as a tank who doesn't remember anything from 10+ years ago. I have warned every group as we formed (before we entered the dungeon) and everyone waited without an issue aside from couple of times with "gogogo faster" when DPSers pulled then died as I have taken the aggro from healer only.
---
Several corpseruns after a wipe will take much more time anyway.
---
lmao, I'm a real man, I put a full-sized spoon!
---
How are they part of it? Can't find anything saying anything other than them just arriving with P4. I only hit 60 after AQ the first time around so I don't remember.
---
Hinterlands I use as well quite often, a bit more doubtful of Lakeshire but it might be a bit easier now compared to first week of phase 2. Back then Burning Steppes had people everywhere, so since you died as soon as you spawned anyways, TP was faster simply because starting distance was short and graveyard was close by.
---
In any case I don't particularly mind if the other faction' Top Honor Rankers only consists of FP farmers :P less "honor" for them I suppose.
---
But horde is at a disadvantage in BG's (palladins op) and will have queues, so in the end camping players might net more honour
---
Today I learned. Neat!
---
Didnt mean while leveling, I respecced at 60. And pre fury tanking gear, which I think is when raiding, prot is better to tank. More threat and more mitigation. 
---
I know later fury gets more threat, but I dont think that’s the case pre raids?
---
240 technically, as the world enlarger at 260 can only be used by gnomish engineers (not merely to learn the schematics, but also to actually USE the device).
---
People underestimate how fucking exhausting grinding honor is when the bg’s are out. I did the rank14 grind and the very last thing I’d want to do is fly to searing gorge after a match only to get a single kills worth of honor while the bg pops. The ques would have to be in excess of 10-15 minutes for it to even be worth it.
---
If they don’t scam you outright then its bannable account sharing which usually causes the banhammer hit fast and hard due to tracking of login locations, unless you somehow get a booster who is honest and close to you geographically
---
Ok
---
Horde bad ally good
---
I actually wasn't sure what they meant by "Italian sausage" so I just put some good quality sausages that I had access to. Is it really made with donkey meat?

Yesterday, lvl 25 troll hunter, outskirts of Ashenville way to the egde away from the road. Ganked by a 60 rogue. Ok, fine, pvp realm and shit, walked back, wend for a drink, and pressed res button after like 15mins of said gank. Chopchop, corps camped. Why on earth is this 60 wasting his/her and my time?
---
The best part these people actually screw their own faction over since they are getting r14 and others aren't.
---
That makes me a sad panda.  Other dagger rogue I'm benchmarking against at both domo and rag has no miss on his backstabs and hence pulling quite a bit more dps
---
How many runs did it take you?
---
I think you can actually remove that debuff. I have no idea but maybe the priest can just "click" it away when he MC's the target. I have no idea how MC works so this is just a very wild guess xD
---
Wait so if you enter que at undercity, go to searing gorge and there you get BG ready. Join anf when you are done with BG you are zoned back to battlmaster at undercity or searing gorge (last location)?
---
You do realize there are battlemasters in the cities that’ll queue you right? You don’t have to go anywhere unless you want to talk to the faction vendor.
---
Why? I have exactly the same. They are fine
---
In early vanilla, not in classic
---
Nuh-uh, Horde's way better on our realm! THink 80/20 is stretching it for sure
---
Funny. I´ve had Staff dropped for me also and stockade pauldrons this weekend.

hot night, gnome beards a blowin, where you think you're going ayebro?
---
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my reddit, so inbox me maybe?
---
It's just better. No reason to use a staff.
---
From the developer this Saturday: ”working on a fix”
---
Meanwhile, here are instructions on how to get it up running on your own machine: https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing
---
You zone back to last location and not the battlmaster then?
---
god damn this, ive wasted so many bandages when a healer heals me to full
---
I imagine the servers you can transfer to are looked on as not having a future.  In comparison you could reroll on a balance and near full but no queue server and not have to worry if you are stuck on a dead server.  Although I guess if you only care about PvP the BGs are always X-realm so not an issue.
---
It is just to save gold while leveling.
---
Shield slam and extra threat in defensive stance help with aggro and allows other dps to go more full out. Helps more than doing dmg on autoattacks while spamming sunder as non prot at my gear level. 
---
When tanking as arms my dmg want great either when wearing a shield. Sure now in prot it is lower, but the extra threat helps other dps do more damage than what I lost.
---
Anything that flipped open was fancy. I remember i had no phone until i was 12 ('95er here).
---
My first phone was a classic Nokia 3310. You were able to send SMS without looking in class. Can't do that as easily nowadays.
---
I am aware i sound old even though i am only 24. Sometimes i feel so disconnected from young people...
---
Because we're not using the original client. Many animations are terribly off from their original versions.
---
&gt; On my PvP server all +48 zones are heavily camped with a lot of the open world, instances and flight points actively patrolled by groups of level 60’s looking to rank 24/7. That means if you are levelling 30-40 minutes of corpse running to instances, death as you land from flying to a point and many of the open world quests left inaccessible.
---
Do people actually enjoy that? I get an hour or two a night if I’m lucky, I can’t imagine spending half of that as a ghost because some turd wants easy honor.
---
Yeah, I've gotten really efficient at lasher farm with my disc priest, can clear every pack, herb and check for books in 9 minutes, but still only looking at about 35g per hour average. Not sure if the farm sucks or if I'm just unlucky. But I often loot entire pulls with no drops.
---
Yeah, you definetly deserve your honor for camping the flightpoint, tab targeting and instakilling solos. Damn these exploiters! Soon horde will stop having alliance to kill for this behavior, shame on you brainless honor farmers.
---
We had 1 sub rogue in mc.
---
He wasnt allowed to use hemo so he dosnt waste debuff slot.
---
Damn Alliance trying to kill totems on my server &gt;:( but no it dont work like that you have to Target them manually might help if ypi get some addon that lights up their health bar
---
If you play a druid, you can fit into any role in 5 man dungeons and just lvl to 60 without questing.
---
You know what drives me insane? Everytime i tap my mana and start bandaging  i always get healed to full. What a waste of bandage. Same goes for food. Don't complain and then heal me to full healers when i start healing myself.
---
Don't bring your logic here! Lol
---
No it was NOT capped at 3000 active users, you're wrong.
---
In the right hands, rogue is the best class in the game, and if you know what you are doing, leveling is pretty easy. However, if its your first char in WoW, you might want to try something else.
---
Yes, you won't be able to level using questing unless you belong to a dominating faction winning at wpvp and it was expected.
---
The only way for you to level is either open world grind in safer location or dungeon leveling then.
---
Most of pre-bis grind requires ton of BRD runs anyway, might as well use it to start earlier with the likeminded group of 50+ (50-53 is ST or Mara though).
---
Was it actually a miss though? Maybe a dodge or parry? 
---
I realise your using backstab but sometime with lag the game thinks your behind the boss so can use backstab when server says you aren’t.
---
You’re in a nasty surprise when you get into BGs buddy. Horde tended to absolutely dominate random BGs because they’re the more PvP-focused faction. Paladins are strong but so is ele resto and the horde facials like hardiness and wotf are also broken for PvP.
---
The queues won’t be that log either due to cross realm queues.
---
I assumed (perhaps wrongly) that you were talking about leveling in your post. I don't know enough about the situation at max level to comment on that.
---
Fake
---
You're not supposed to be at war with them - some sub-factions are, but overall there is peace between the Alliance &amp; Horde, which is why the quests &amp; world is the way it is.
---
I still enjoy the game and that is all that matters. I still can play several hours now and then, so dungeons and raiding shouldn't be an issue. So don't tell me I am not the target audience. Also there is PvP, professions, farming etc. All things you can do if you only have 1-2 hours available.
---
Also Classic was designed with casual players in mind. It's a casual friendly game.
---
They just released content too quickly. Dire Maul wasn't released until 3 months into Vanilla. Why release it after 1 1/2 months already? Dire Maul is partly a catch up mechanic. Why release a catch up mechanic when most non hardcore players aren't even 60 yet? It doesn't make a lot of sense. Right about now would be a good time to release Dire Maul and the rest of P2 in a few months. That's #NoChanges which all you hardcore people wanted so much.
---
This is not entirely accurate. Many of us only sub for classic. So that’s not “free” that’s an active game sub that wouldn’t exist if we didn’t want to play classic.
---
Cheapest way? Wait for AV in a couple of weeks and spam the quest handins. You get rep with all the alliance factions.
---
Turtles in Hinterlands are a good place too. Very little competition. Their drop rate is horrible though.
---
Word.  Phase 2 came in when I was at 49.  I've only levelled twice since then, and I was at 88% on 49 anyway.  Searing Gorge was a nightmare, Felwood is almost worse as you HAVE to use the road where there's constant bands of Alliance bravely roflstomping 50s.
---
Found a bit of solace last night partnering up with an alliance warrior who was doing Jaedenar same time as me, then when we were done 3 60s on my side rolled him.  Called them out for it but the silence on chat afterwards was deafening.  Arseholes.
---
LMAOOO u think horde / alliance are friendly to each other HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
is there an ingame way to get it back or is his char forever locked out of Onyxia or at least until a GM is finished laughing after reading that ticket?
---
Done.
---
Yeah levelling as arms was painful enough, not going to recommend going prot while leveling. That must be horrible.
---
I mean that p2 came too early for a lot of people because classic wow is not the kind of game that should require you to play every day. It was always intended for a more casual crowd. Blizzards decision fucked quite a few of them over
---
my dumb ass went to hover over buffs
---
If I remember it was speculated for "player owned houses"
---
The term casual meant vastly different things when vanilla got released. You were a casual in vanilla when you played 4 hours daily.
---
Needing on an item they already had because it had higher durability.

 &lt;Peaky Grinders&gt; | Mograine | Horde | Semi-Hardcore
---
Hello everyone!
---
The **Peaky Grinders** is a semi-hardcore guild on EU - Mograine that aims to attract players that have to combine World of Warcraft with work, families and a social life.
---
Currently we have 2 non-fixed raid teams and we are clearing Molten Core on Wednesday and Thursday evenings (it takes us about 2 hours atm, but we take two smoke/toilet breaks during our run). Our two Onyxia raids are on Sunday: one in the morning and one in the evening. We also organize wpvp events and will be very active in the battleground scene as well when that hits.
---
We are currently looking for some more Shamans to join our ranks. We're looking for Resto and Enhancement Shaman who are raid-ready and familiar with both raids. We have the content on farm so we won't bother with explaining boss mechanics in detail.
---
If you wanna join with a rl friend (or more than one) we're open to discuss it. 
---
We use a DKP loot system with a cap of 600 DKP (= 5 weeks of raiding) so that new recruits would be able to catch up. We have listed a few select items that are priority for core raiders. As you join you will not be a core raider yet but you can become one after staying with us and proving yourself. Feel free to hit me with your questions regarding our loot system.
---
You can contact me here on Reddit through PM or in-game on Girlgonewild, Billyblitz or Buts.
---
Alliance crying they need to 5v1 to win? Pretty sure it's the opposite thus why horde just keep flooding the same servers to further increase imbalance
---
You can make alts or personal targets if you still want to play. Like 5kg or so.
---
But if you're online just because you got nothing else to do, I'd advise finding something else to do.
---
Easiest thing to do is find other games to play until BWL comes. Steam is a good start.
---
most of them are legit, they offer to level you characters fast. The issue is that its not cheap. 1-60 is like £400-£500! 
---
Also, you run the risk of once they are done, that when you log in, the Blizzard AI detects unusual log in, and then bans your account.
---
As soon as the gm finished laughing he sent him a new one. This will gorever be remembered tho, same when one of our tanks found put he was still wearing his herblore gloves after we sowned sulfuron harbinger... we have fun.
---
Nothing changes. You log off from BGs and farm honor in open world until BGs are out. Corpse Camping Faction aint good on ming games either. Keep up exploiting the open world corpse camping farm of honorless targets! :)
---
Spy and addons like it weren't even remotely close to the use it is atm in vanilla. If it would this is something Blizzard would have changed back then as well. Spy is kinda obviously not in the spirit of the game considering it could detect enemies in a greater range than built in-game mechanics (track humanoids) if it was intended to find players on that range why would track have a lower range..
---
What is the reason for them to duel?
---
When I was searching the internet for information about BG's, I found a lot of old discussions about it. Most seemed to agree that Palladins were OP in BG, cause with a pally you could infinetly stall untill you win. Seems to me any try hard alliance premade will be running a palladin.
---
And yes queues will still be long, most alliance players are on PvE servers.
---
You don’t need any engineering as a horde
---
There are many things in here that resonate with me, but there's a few key differences in my experience that make me love the game.
---
First, guild stuff. I'm in a guild made up entirely of irl friends of the guild master, meaning I knew half the guild in person beforehand and the others I've gotten to know a bit by now. So doing guild stuff is always fun, nobody expects anyone else to contribute, we're just in it because we enjoy it. It also ensures I got to run most dungeons once with guildies before having to pug, which made things a lot easier.
---
Then there's the social anxiety part. I was pretty terrified of pugging at the start. Didn't really want to tank, especially when I didn't know the dungeon yet. But eventually I joined groups out of necessity, and thanks to how easy it is to find groups as a tank, I ended up tanking most of the time. When I ran a dungeon I'd never done before, I'd say so. Asked people to show me the way. The vast majority of people didn't complain even when things went wrong. The rest were happy enough if I apologised and asked how to do better. There's only really been one group with toxic people and they just left after the third wipe.
---
I don't know if I just got lucky. Maybe it's related to the difference in people that pick horde vs alliance, though that would surprise me. Having a guild that cares more about having fun and where people aren't toxic because we know eachother helps a lot I guess, but the pugs? Really don't know why our experiences differ so much.
---
Wow i never noticed how ridiculously  large human calves are until now
---
Paladins are strong so some people bitch about it on forums, shock. Won’t stop the alliance getting absolutely slapped in BGs and the aggregate win rate being 70-30 in hordes favour.
---
Haha - I saw the top comment there and decided to put it into action. Nice to see this sub proves them wrong ^_^
---
Yes, 100% worth it.
---
Looks awesome like always. 
---
I hope you can sell prints someday. Im sure some WoW enthusiasts would love them.
---
There may be two problems with the book:
---
Imperial system.
---
Absence of ingridients.
---
Converting ounces, cups and spoons into normal measurements take time and some ingridients has to be replaced with something else.
---
I had [this](https://fdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/bigpic/no3650.gif) abomination. But dear God I loved it.
---
Does miss % cover literally only miss or does it lump in things like dodge and parry as well? It's impossible to hit 100% of the time, both because there's always a base 1% chance to miss and bosses always have a dodge and parry chance too.
---
You dont uderstand that if warlock tap and heal put single hot on him, dungeon group will move faster, why? Because eating to full health cost 15 sec and mana from single hot will be probably regenerated from spirit during fight.
---
If everyone is eating and warlock is tabbing and w8ing for heal in one place 15sec, just because he want to save money from food is different story. 
---
It depends from the group class configuration, but this is saving some time for everyone, if its done right way. If you save 15-40 sec, between pulls from 20-30 eats for the run, that is like 15-20 min less per dungeon. I am talking about grinding at lvl 60.
---
Depends on your situation. Are you pugging or guild raiding? Is your guild hardcore or not? Are most of the people in the raid either geared or know what they re doing or both?
---
If your guild doesnt wipe and does MC + Ony under 2h then min maxing further is pointless really. But it all depends on what your situation is.
---
I felt sympathetic when I read the title until I opened it and saw you are a gnome. Dude, you had it coming and you deserve it.
---
I just [recreated the OG screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4nNTxQf.jpg) from 2005
---
[here's proof](https://i.imgur.com/zCNM5DU.jpg)! (heh pun intended)
---
Hahah... You think parents with a family can play 3 hours every day? Yeah sure if you make it clear you don't give a crap about spending time with your girl even one day.
---
20 hours is not casual by any means. I'd say a few hours here and there, commiting yourself to play every day is not casual.
---
The “misses” in the logs are dodges. You can hover over it and it will show you the dodges. Bosses can dodge from behind but can’t parry.
---
Read it again.
---
They are cheap bastards that don't want to learn higher ranks. Or they just troll.
---
One at a time yeah
---
Hehe I got to 32 so far since the 3rd day of WorldPVP. 
---
Gotta say - I currently don't like running around in high Level zones. But it is really good for my alt. Would never have gotten so far by now if it wasn't for WorldPVP.
---
Thank you Blizzard =) Gonna love playing my rogue at 60
---
Really a rare sight for someone to not just melt my face. No matter what level range or where we are
---
Im new to classic, what can i do as hunter to farm gold that isnt DM N tribute insane run? And what items can i use from engi to pvp eficiently?
---
While I support distributing the burden group wide, or just isn’t worth it for a tank to bandage between pulls. Either they are losing rage when the group is good to go, or it’s just as easy to sit and eat while everyone drinks.
---
During a pull a Health pot or stone is actually going to work, definitely support those.
---
Classic was never intended to not play daily. Not sure why you think otherwise. 
---
I think people mistake why people called vanilla more casual. Because it was in comparison to old mmo predating it. Not because you can do anything meaningful in it with 1-2 hours per day.
---
Because you'll have 5 days /played for 1-60 and weeks-months of /played for end-game content. What's the point of playing basketball if you don't like driving to the court?
---
Well ***technically*** that means warlocks are better than mages in that regard.
---
 However in reality mages are better if we go to 75th percentile which I think is an acceptable level to look at we see mages pull a head by quite a bit.
---
This basically.. I haven't touched quests since lvl 12, except the class ones ofc.. Level 54 at the moment (started way late) Just dungeon grinding, and I'm on par or slightly slower than my friends or guild mates who quested. I'm a shaman, deep resto since lvl 30ish.. Not that hard to find grps or make your own.
---
Now that wpvp is out questing is a nightmare. Don't despair and get them dungeons :)
---
Is that where they finally get to that bridge?
---
bind FAP to charge or dont bother
---
Italian sausage refers to the spices in the sausage iirc. Not sure about the mixture but i imagine something like thyme, oregano, maybe basil.
---
I also heard of "sweet italian sausage". Now that leaves me dumbfounded if people really put sugar or sweetening in a sausage.
---
Also, sometimes sausage means just the filling of a sausage casing. not cut disks of the sausage. It's really weird at times...
---
Pvp flags in a major city l o l
---
if you actually believe FP camping people are the top honor players rn you are really ignorant or playing on a dead server. there is not enough traffic (and also there is a fuckton of horde so the honor gets split) on FP to be top bracket just by camping it. FP is more of a semi afk method to get honor while doing other stuff.
---
Test
---
I think it's just what the game incentivises atm. Imagine your honor/hour if you only pick fights against someone who is 1) ready, 2) appropriately leveled 3) not already doing something else 4) with no other horde or alliance nearby.
---
Again, what issues? There is no enforced fairness on pvp servers. If that’s not ok for you you have chosen the wrong server type.
---
My man its okay! Since mc/ol will be our content for upcoming 2 months atleast no meed to rush :)
---
KISS ME? YOU SMART AS MOTHERFUCKER
---
but it's also a huge undertaking to make a 49 twink. You have to level to 49 AND get all the best items in that time. Like that maraudon princess ring. It wouldn't surprise me if getting that perfectly equipped 49 twink takes even more time and effort than just being level 60 and raiding a few evenings per week.
---
Faction balance is actually BETTER on retail. And they have a ~70-30 horde to alliance ratio in Arena, even when alliance racials are preferable. If you think horde queues will be any less than 20-30 min you're naive to the point of stupidity.
---
5 weeks of leafs.
---
My wife says 7 seconds seems like a long time.
---
bouta to do this tmrw yipppieeeeeeeeeee
---
That Chipotle broke your ass so hard you had to break out the 2 ply runecloth
---
Those misses include dodkes and paries. You can see what exactly happened in EVENTS tab of log
---
It depends. The content is so easy it like barely matters unless you are speedrunning or want it for pvp.
---
I think otherwise because you could not play it daily perfectly fine back then, even on pvp servers. You'd just progress a lot slower, whereas now it's unplayable
---
I don't "believe", I've stood there and watched them do this and I know who the top ranked players on my server are.  Also you clearly can't read as the op has shown the issue here is that honor isn't being split.  That's how they're stacking so much to one person.
---
Did you try to use the default raid interface?
---
I especially suggest to put the party window somewhere closer to where you normally look. I put them horizontally right above the action bars and have my player and target above that.
---
heartseeker and arcanite reaper
---
also why won't you go play pve server and just flag yourself there? i hear there is always pvp there
---
Any secret place to farm essence of earth? i am tired of the overfarmed silithus area. They cost 40 golds it's crazy, no idea why they're so expensive right now
---
Imagine thinking this will make it better... Horde will have long queues and rankers will have to PvP in the world while queueing, while alliance Will never leave city as their queues will be instant. Instead of being outnumbered 60-40 you're gonna be outnumbered 90-10.
---
Even classes who are considered good in 1v1s benefit so so much from carrying around consumables.
---
like anyone was happy to have him on first place.
---
Good riddance
---
The problem aren't the player its the honor system that incentive them to have the most honor on their faction side.
---
So they need higher honor per kill and don't want to help a potential contender. It suck, but as stated many time this system only incentivise people to game the system to get the most honor they can m.
---
How is it noticeably more efficient to heal from 40% to 100% than 20% to 80%? Besides Warlocks who is really self healing that much?
---
I’d guess if you had a Shadow Priest in your group it’d change the dynamic.
---
Same here. Hit 60 on a Pvp realm, re-rolled on a pve one last week
---
Good Times!
---
My Hand of Edward the Odd and Lifestealing Enchant also never procced on Reckoning swings. I tested it extensively last weekend.
---
That coupled with a max of 4 Reckoning charges means Reckoning is a dead talent to me. Especially once people start getting PVP gear, 5 swings is not going to cut it.
---
\#NoChanges
---
That’s more your fault than his. You stayed on for 8 hours just watching someone set camp on your dead body?
---
Hey congrats! Feel good vibes my dude.
---
Herod is relatively balanced actually, like 60/40 at worst. Combined with the massive population and both sides are having problems leveling.
---
quick, post it on a internet forum !
---
interesting the difference between servers, at mine winterspring is a 24/7 warzone
---
terrible source
---
My bad then, I just knew APES is rather hardcore and heard that APEX is rolled on horde because there's some rivalry or something.
---
Depends on the pull too. Mobs with AoE are a lot more tenuous for healers I imagine
---
As a warlock, every time I cast Hellfire it's while cackling like a madman and knowing that sudden death is a likely outcome.
---
Isn’t like 80% of this playerbase fathers and husbands? Noticed this a lot with people I’ve played with.
---
Thanks will try it out. I guess there are some addon where I very rarely need the buttons (after the initial setup).
---
A level 36 warrior, nonetheless.  I don't think I've ever attacked a warrior when I'm out levelling.  It's just not cricket.
---
Best past was to experience vanilla again. And now that I have had that I must admit I struggle with motivation. Part of my brain tells me that I should not waste time on something that never progress. Everything I achieve in classic will not be taken further....and that part of my brain thinks I am an idiot for doing it lol.
---
In case you don't know about it, AtlasLootClassic is a good add on to quickly check out all the loot available for dungeons and raids along with what boss drops what and those items' droprate.
---
The Horde and Alliance are at war. The literal cinematic begins with "the drums of war can be heard again" or something. Tons of quests involve murdering the other faction. Hillsbrad as Horde has you destroying an entire Alliance town and it's mine. Ashenvale has an open conflict between the Orcs and Night Elves. Multiple Tauren quests have you destroying entire dwarven outposts and encampments. In Silverpine you murder Dalaran wizards. Half the zones with Horde and Alliance presence has you massacring dozens of the opposite faction, not to mention the kill on site reaction every guard has to the opposite faction. If the Alliance and Horde weren't at war you would be able to visit each others capitals.
---
Thank you
---
It isnt skyrim. Do not place high hopes for questing/story. The idea is that you incrementally upgrade your character (skills, gear, reputation with factions) whilst also learning a lot of mechanics along the way (huuuge learning curve, ive played from vanilla but i am considered a scrub still). Its a super social game so dont expect to have any fun if you cant put yourself out there to join dungeon / questing groups. That being said, ive gotten away with avoiding my guild and just pugging for my entire experience - adding friends and joining their groups when your reputation isnt on the line is less stressful than being 100% all the time because youre in a guild run
---
I actually did log a couple times for a reasonable amount of time but they were still there when I came back from the store.
---
For the sake of levelling on my alliance dominated pvp server as a horde, I specced Nightfall/Soul Link on my warlock (20/31/0) and I’m having a ton of fun with this in open world/pvp and my damage doesn’t seem too bad in pve so far. Any experience in pve with this spec or is this an absolute no go to go raiding with?
---
Entertainment is entirely subjective, not sure what you're implying. It's literally him entertaining tens of thousands of people and getting paid for it. The constant hate posts about him on this sub alone are more publicity than most could ever hope for.
---
I am a Troll Tank and need to know the gear set. Do I have to go full Fire Resistance set sacrificing Hit Chance or should be mix with a FR and Hit Chance (Minimum) ?
---
Yes, very mercenary
---
300 dps for a geared hunter is bad. i have 3 giantstalker and onyxia neck i and do 500-600. no pots. or dm raid buffs
---
What is the addon that shows debuffs on top of enemy nameplate?
---
omg tilt the phone!!!
---
#nochanges
---
What's insane about DM N?
---
I just can’t believe that mate, I’m sorry
---
damn I’ve grouped with you a thousand times
---
I mean war literally did change.... when people became incentivised to kill lowbies.
---
I felt so smart slapping renew on a lightly scratched warlock right before the fight ended.  They'll see they are hurt, see the hot healing them, and then figure out they can tap a few times safely.
---
Drinks.
---
Okay, they're going to drink so they don't need hea-
---
**TAPTAPTAPTAPTAP!**
---
ARGH!
---
1. Fury warriors cant win against mages. Unless said mage is a very bad player. Just run.
---
2. Get engineering. its 110% **MANDATORY** in classic.
---
Add some core. Like planking for entire flightpaths :P
---
Don’t be sorry for me. Be sorry for the person on the other ends time management.
---
Warrior vs mage is a very tough match up, even if you use all consumes and stuff, if they can just Iceblock and wait it out.
---
I want that feelingg
---
This is NOT the experience I had playing on a pvp server back in vanilla (or BC since it has mostly the same leveling experience).
---
that default sexy map skin doesn't match the style of you ui.
---
Blizzard fucked up when they decided to drastically increase the population caps for servers without also addressing the fact the world itself was only designed to handle so many people at once.
---
Not enough resources. Not enough space. No truly offpeak hours.
---
And the solution blizzard offers for their fuckup are server xfers, which don't actually address the issue at all.
---
Yeah alliance are doing the same thing.
---
Plus iam 100% sure the guys is camping fly path all day.
---
Swifty is getting streamsniped constantly. Esfand too.
---
To be clear, this isn't about anything Horde or Alliance related, it's about being a big streamer. Hell, even a 100 viewer streamer on my server is being streamsniped constantly, lol.
---
A druid who so far has got 8/8 t1 and 2/2 t2 being whiny for not being allowed to roll on items that are better for dps than healers, like staff of dominance, firelords choker, ring of spell power and such.
---
Firstoff, wall of text Tl;Dr at the bottem and for others who are reading the wall, english is not my main language so you will find grammar errors.
---
Oke, so i went in totally blank. I have had my fair share of experience from other MMO's but this was totally different.
---
So i started 3/4 days after the launch as a nightelf hunter. it took me 2/3 evenings tot even get to level 10. note that i have a full time job and some other hobbies so playing for 2/3 hrs a day. the reason why is also because i am pretty dense and not paying that much attention. At level 5 i came to find out that i had a bow. i was using a single dagger all the time because the auto attack was for dagger only. other games switch automaticly to ranged or melee when pressing auto attack. 
---
Man i have to tell you. This game is so freaking confusing. i couldn't find the npcs for my quests. i was running around the map for hours trying to find the location of the questgivers.
---
so now i get the hang of it. i know how to use the bow and at lvl 10 i've gotten a cat. cool. goddam pussy keeps disapearing on me for no apparent reason. so i was ranting about this to my coworker, that my pet keeps leaving me and i had to tame an other one every othe 10minutes. he laughed and told me i had to feed this thing. great more things to keep in mind. 
---
My coworker also asked me how it was possible i was leveling so slow. he was already level 40ish and i was stil level 12/15. so i explained it to him and he told me there where things like add-ons. dear lord this triggerd me so much.but i got the addon questie and he provided me with some links to guide me through the maps and quests. 
---
so i joined a guild with al experienced players who are all, like yourself, a veteran in the game started playing 15 years ago. all warriors pallys mages. but only a few hunters whom i didnt really connect with. so this tank and healer took me on my furst dungeon run. deadmines i think it was.and they've guided me the whole time and giving me dungeon tips. like some commands for my pet. and that i can command my pet into attacking other targets instead of it just being an npc tagging my targets.
---
fast forward to level 30. it was fun but very hard. my cat was doing oke damage but i was lacking damage. i knew i could buy skills and upgrade skills for my bow and at a website i've found what type of skillrotation i should use. but i kept dying. so i started ranting on my guild discord and a kind samaritan asked my what my build was. so i told him my skill rotation. now this guys tells me there where such things as talents. oh boy how i've done myself wrong al these days/weeks for not using talents(like i said, im kinda dense and not really paying attention and just play the game and enjoy the enviroment). well after he helped me with my talents i just got such a boost. my cat was doing good damage now and i would survive better in the open world.
---
so after this i tried to keep my talents and skills up to date and ranking them up. i started doing 1 dungeon every night and quest for the remaining time of the evening. loot started dropping and i found a pretty good bow. it was a purple bow of the searing arrow, iirc. sold this thing on the AH because i had a blue bow from a dungeon. I thought well my att of 1.7sec against 3sec is better. boii what was i wrong. getting a level 37 purple bow at level 38ish was the best thing that happend but because i read i should go for a mount asap and this thing wasnt BiS....
---
\*btw imho BiS is freaking bullshit if you ask me and should only be for maxed out players. not for levelers without experience in the game.\*
---
oke i got over the face i sold the bow and im doing pretty good. i switched out my cat for a gorilla. This thing could take more hits and let me kill 1 monster at a time. So now i am level 45ish hooked up with an experienced hunter who played vanilla and gave me some tips on other macros and addons. and had a great laugh when he asked me the same question like OP did. 
---
now i told you guys i am dense. but this dude managed to teach me one more thing about the hunter. i could freaking rank up the skills of my pet too. i had almost 200points to spend on ranking up my petskills!. i was only able to tank 1 elite with my gorilla, now he can tank 3 elites of my own level it is actually absurd. 
---
this was my full experience up till now, i am level 46 almost dinging 47 and i am still grinding at my own pace. i got kicked out/left of 3 guild because i wasn't level 60 yet and the made me feel like i was some sort of liability because i didnt feel like staying with toxic people who didnt let me play the game i wanted to play it. I kept in touch with the ones who helped me in the pass and guided me in missions and dungeons. i still enjoy the experience of playing a MMORPG without any knowledge of the game. and because ive been playing mmo's since the 90's it is pretty rare to have this new experience in a fresh economy.
---
TL;DR 
---
its been a real struggle but i've enjoyed everybit up till now. most of the community has been great and there will always be bad weeds in the field. I kindoff regret not playing this game when vanilla launched but hé im experiencing it now and i am learning day by day.
---
I got it on a single layer while layers were still a thing. But that was like 2 weeks into Classic or so.
---
I wonder if ele sham with Edward the Odd/Windfury works.
---
Never claimed it to be efficient mate. All I'm trying to say is that's it's a nice break from the grind in my opinion, you go do whatever you want. 
---
No luck needed, I'm not one of the lads trying to farm 10k gold for kicks.
---
Level an alt, then at the end of the day, you can farm some diff instance with it.
---
Proc will fuck up things like gouge, etc
---
You are making it sound like what pservers did in Azshara and everywhere else was not a huge achievement.
---
Agreed. Epic mount is worth if you play alot and thus travel alot.
---
Fyi: It‘s usually not the hardcore players getting bored.
---
I‘m in a hardcore guild, we‘ve all been 60 since a week after release, cleared mc 8 days after release, have epic mount since mid of september, full prebis since end of september (was actually a deadline), have a 60 alt since beginning of october and guess what: all of us are still playing.
---
The issue is not people who rush things, the issue is casual players who get bored because content is too easy. Even very casual gamer dads are 60 with epic mount and MC on farm by now, and those people are the ones quitting the game!
---
Thats what I said, I’m reconsidering.
---
But they don't have girls.
---
I think that's the joke.
---
Nah, it's just you being dumb.
---
Come over to my place and I will give you fortitude, nightfin snapper, and thank you four more smite damage.
---
Yeah, getting down to what's the most efficient honor becomes really boring.  Especially when the other faction doesn't want to fight unless there's a sure win.  
---
I enjoy roaming as 5 and finding a group of 5 to fight against, but the same people who will happily gank me 5v1 I have to chase across the entire map ( I literally did this 3x today ) to engage them 5v5.  I even had a group of 5 jump off the cliff at the winterspring frost giants and kill themselves rather than engage in a fair fight once we finally cornered them. It's just a huge waste of time when I could've ganked someone on the way to a dungeon for the same honor solo.
---
I just don't get why engaging in fights and honor trading has to be so difficult.  Everyone just runs away until they have 2x numbers, forcing honor grinders to camp solo areas ( and yes this is why you have to die 10 times to get into dire maul ).
---
I love wpvp to death but the honor system is really busted, making me happy BGs are coming soon.
---
Zerg incoming
---
Disagree. Some stuff in azshara is really hard. For example P3 is what breaks most guilds. P1 is doable. P2 is doable. P4 is doable. But P3 is hard as fuck. You have the small adds that throws the spear. you have to see where they are standing since they are not always at the same spot. So you have to kite the spear through the shild and the hitbox is much smaller than the shield itself (you have to aim for the ward add, not the shield on the add). If the spear add is too close to the ward, you cant stand between the spear add and the shield add. so you have to walk behind the shield add. if you are too far away because you were playing another mechanic you are not able to get there in time. that means the spear doesnt hit the add. Thats an instant wipe right there. We had dozens of wipes where the spear missed the add by one yard. 
---
If you are soaking the ward while the spear mechanic goes onto another player, you have a high chance to die right there.
---
Left side add becon is quite close as well.  
---
Most top 500 guild have way more than 300 pulls on azshara JUST because P3 is hard.
---
Dark souls is a fkn joke against that. The only thing that kills you in dark souls is ignorance. You dont know what is happening and it kills you. once you know what is happening its fkn easy.
---
The difficulty from raiding comes from executing the abilities. 
---
And PvP is something completely different.
---
For certqin things it makes sense, for others it doesnt
---
I'm with you brother. I gave up on my tank early on rolled a ranged dps to learn the pulls. Now that I know them, if the tank isn't marking, I mark. No sense in not using markers even if the tank knows what's up, all better for the dps to focus fire as much as possible.
---
That is some very good stuff.
---
Arms and Fap is all it takes to beat a bad mage. A good mage is unbeatable though.
---
He said his HS is set to Kargath because “he is a raider” (more like he is camping flight paths in searing gorge)
---
Haha so true actually
---
Just curious, where did you farm and circa how much time did it take?
---
Pretty much me, I mean I'll pvp in battleground n stuff but I mainly play pvp servers because of the increased freedom and player agency.
---
Like it or not, removal of auto-flagging in contested zones neuters a huge part of the game - the risk/reward of various zones goes to nothing and I personally would get very bored.  I mean imagine leveling through STV on a pve server with no danger at all, and therefore no sense of achievement when you finally complete it.
---
Plus I have to say, even as a casual pvper at best, some of the most fun I've had is duoing with a warrior m8 while leveling on pvp servers.  A lot of people try to gank, and not all that many succeed which is super fun.
---
You still do damage, but you would do so much more as another spec.
---
You could probably PUG as SL if you didn't tell anyone that you were SL
---
Fear breaks quite readily and it's surprisingly hard to cast one against a number of classes unless you deathcoil, grenade or seduce first, all of which have cooldowns and are hard to use mid fight as they break on damage.
---
Not saying it doesn't look strong, it is in a group setting but 1v1 locks are not (yet) the OP class you think they are.
---
I dunno at least people jump each other on sight instead of tip toeing and then getting slammed when u pull a mob
---
&gt;	„I’m the tank, so either shut up, or good luck finding a replacement“!
---
r/ThatHappened
---
Yes it will. When BGs are released, people who actively pvpd will be 4 weeks ahead. If you end near the top of bracket 1 every week, you‘ll be rank 9 when bgs are released. That means 1/3 of the rank 14 grind will already be done for those people.  Even with bgs the highest amount of RP you can get is simply top of bracket 1. How much honor that is does not affect anything at all!
---
How can someone be this mad over a comic, especially when it's true
---
Healcom is the lib you are referring to. Yes there was another one, before, since healcom wasn't being updated, but that is outdated and no frames use. Anymore. It was made by the guy who makes Luna frames, because of lack of other options, until the actual healcom lib was revived.
---
&gt; You don't get much utility from an epic mount
---
Anytime :) take it easy pal
---
Yes Hitchance is necessary
---
Out of the 60+ times I ran it, it dropped twice and 2 priest healers needed and won. Drop rate seems terrible he always drops same garbage.
---
My point still stands, dont complain as you dont have to play on a PVP server. if playing MMO's for almost 20 years has taught me anything is people are dicks and when they are bored they will piss people off to make themselves feel better. Happens on retail still got ganked by a 120 rogue while leveling my priest in Loch Moden just before classic came out.
---
Edgemaster's or Lionheart.
---
No there isn’t. On a 50:50 server you will still be steamrolled 1vX by 10 Person death balls of either faction. That’s life. If you can’t tolerate unfair situations pvp servers are simply not for you. If you want to pick and choose your battles play pve servers. If you want fairness in numbers play bgs.
---
Warriors before 40 are easily the least OP class.
---
Gratz ! 
---
Btw guys, with my guold we cleared mc and ony numerois times, so people got some gear.
---
Yesterday after mc they split raid in two groups.
---
Problem is they put all geared people in first group with 3 paladins, when we were all the poorly geared dudes with one pala with greenies... We tried 5 times and wiped every time... We were blatantly lacking dps.
---
It was the most boring gaming night i've had in a while... Whats your opinion about this ?
---
Took me about 50 minutes to get from Kargath to BRD.
---
A few guilds were camping so I managed to move about 10 meters each time i respawned until i made it into BRD. I am druid so I could even stealth. They can still detect me in Stealth and just spam AOE since its only 50 yards now for Spy addon. Took about 10 hours to get not even a half level from 59-60. A Saturday not well spent...
---
Alliance or horde? Cause if you’re a horde we have to fight to the death!  
---
Other than that Stonespine rules!
---
Same, I get an error box pop up if I start necrosis.  Tried deleting all of its cache files and everything.
---
You can kill green mobs faster without the stun, literally a few auto hits will sort it. Yellow mobs a CS is useful of course. For Sub post 40 it's always worth with the energy reduction. Removing avoided hits off the table and damage taken is great.
---
Sounds like lucifron
---
People are salllllty. 
---
Geez. Lighten up and be happy you don't have to run from the graveyard. Who GAF how much health your rezzed with.
---
Damages yourself slightly and then does a random amount of physical damage to your target.
---
You'll see rogues use it on you all the time if you roam alone and have enough health not to die to a single stunlock.
---
No offence but people farming fps aren’t rank 14 bracket or even semi close
---
How old are you, 16?
---
The zergling is bis in Wrath though because they added a murloc starcraft marine pet in wrath from blizzcon + virtual ticket which will shoot at, chase, and kill the zergling if someone else has it out.
---
Where are these mobs?
---
Can anyone confirm if the uploads to warcraft logs are affected by this also or if those ones are collected in a different way and can be trusted?
---
Also some good loot with Rotgrip Mantle, the Head/Neck (not sure) from princess... Can use that for quite some time.
---
One could argue if the ability to use google to look up stat priorities and rotations is skillful or not. Especially since from what I've gathered reading this sub most bosses are tank and spanks or awfully close to that, so you barely need to worry about any boss mechanics.
---
Imagine being this angry over a simple question.
---
Hey guys pointing out that it's NoT a OnE sHoT, OP did not make the video, and the original video never mentions one-shot anywhere.
---
why dont you just add him??? i dont understand
---
As a shaman you want darnassus rep?
---
It wont get much better at 60. Getting to dungeons will take ages, flightmasters will be camped and zergs in every raid. I only log on for raid nights because, as much as I love PvP, this is not fun in the slightest.
---
I don’t see what’s wrong or broken about this
---
You can't shift the burden of proof like that. The person making the claim should provide a source, not the other way around.
---
It's not a competition to see who has less time to play. I'm playing far more casual this time around than I did back when i was playing tbc and wrath. I'd say im fairly casual and I probably get 25-30 hours a week.
---
&gt;Blizzard please fix game litterally unplayable for the horde!
---
Notice how nobody but you made this claim.
---
Lol wtf. Have you healed a dungeon before. You expect a healer to stop, find the warlock, and visual check if they have aggro?  Of course healers just stare at their interface.
---
I play horde side on Stonespire and tbh i feel our server isnt gettin the drama other pvp servers r experiencing.
---
leveling a alt and i dont rly see that much big of a deal. the occasional gank if im out numbered and so on.
---
BRM is rly the only place where i see more issues but i cant say it is horde dominated or ally, it rly comes down to whom ever is ther first and with how many ppl.
---
What spec are you? I guess 31 in ret bc i see soc and 20 in prot? With skullflame shield or witout?
---
Depends on the server
---
dont forget redridge fucking mountains:)))
---
Good luck on farming that shit! Gave up after 50 runs lol
---
Been solo grinding to level 45 and have only had one blue drop.  Crappy dredgewood sledge. Can’t even sell oh AH for 3g.
---
Grats, bro.  I hate you.
---
Going to raid wailing caverns? Don't forget to buy some ankhs.
---
I'm just sick of having every flight point and dungeon packed with horde waiting to 20v1 some lvl 20 that won't give honor or shit
---
Mageblade is bis until bwl (if you don't manage to grind r13), and unless your guild will clear up to chromaggus in week 1 and you're guaranteed to get his dagger on first drop, the enchant is unequivocally worth it. Even then, you'll enjoy a solid sp boost for several months.
---
He’s not of the same faction. you can’t actually “duel” opposing factions.  So they just fought to the death.
---
i'm on hydraxian waterlords, rp normal server and we aren't in surpopulation at all
---
I want AQ and Naxx, wanna get some semblance of challange.
---
Casual is relative to the amount of time you have spare. I wouldn't say that is casual, but that's based off the free time I get.
---
&gt;It's 100% the healers responsibility to manage their mana according to the circumstance.
---
I completely agree.  It's also 100% the warlock's job to manage their own HP.  Thats their resource.
---
I will heal them of course, but I also expect them to heal themselves.
---
You have twitch in your name, just show us the recording m8.
---
but you could do that with a 19 or 29 twinks as well. A 49 twink is significantly more time investment.
---
You can if they're not flagged. You can totally run up to people outside Dun Morogh/Durotar and /duel them (if they don't kill you on sight).
---
It’s two minutes
---
Who would have thought that horde players are smart enough for such an organized formation.
---
It doesn’t need to be a raid
---
You do know that the battle royale trend is so 2018 right ? /s
---
Congrats that might be hard to top though :)
---
 I can't believe anyone is concerned about not getting honor, while you all camp a flight path. You're basically all fucken bots at this point.
---
The mere fact you and many others actually enjoy this kind of "world pvp" tells me plenty of Horde and Alliance  are actually fucked in the head.
---
You honestly are the worst kind of person, even worse than the two who worked out a cool albeit fucken sad way to prey on others with no challenge. 
---
Suck a fat dick, you are pissed about honor. Reroll opposite faction and go kill them for a challenge. You fucken mindless soggy sayo. Move the fuck on with your life.
---
Warmest Regards
---
M+ numbers and wow progress say otherwise
---
All capital cities in classic have Battle Masters. A party leader can queue up in the city and all members will be in queue but when the bg is over all members are ported to where the queue was. So if you have to venture out in the world again .
---
This is going to mean that horde will have longer que times because they have more players. Alliance will have instant queues and that means you stay in the city. The world will be even more horde dominated when BGS are out perhaps.
---
Yeah, no friends.
---
mograine is prob closer to 50/50 then 90% of servers... pretty sure you want a pve server..
---
This is the way

---
Just get the guy when he rezzes. You'll most likely be able to get a huge payout since he starts with 50% life.
---
This stuff gets done once per perso. That lands, who cares. Camping there is shit honor per hour
---
I picked a level 58 Warrior DPS to join us in Scholomance out of the kindness of my heart... He barely does any damage, it is a bit of a struggle, but we keep on trucking on. He needs on an +attack power mail chest piece, saying it's "unironically better than what I have". I pay this no mind, but learn later that he never equipped the item and that should have been the red light. Later, he ninja's Recipe: Flask of Supreme Power. His excuse? "I'm going Alchemy later", even though we already have a 300 Alchemist in the party. After giving him a chance to give the recipe back, he doesn't, so I kick him. As he's heartstoning out, he says "You should have rolled need on it too. I bet you now regret it."
---
So, right away my party members go to LFG to warn people of the ninja. And this is where the guy makes his mistake. Instead of being quiet, he speaks instead. Not really even defending himself, just calling himself "the guy who won the recipe: flask of supreme power", implying that we are only mad because we didn't roll need on it. Then LFG starts taking the piss out of him. He finds two people who defend him, but those people quickly get added to the shitlist, along with the real ninja. People gather around Ironforge to laugh at him. At first he's there, talking back all entitled, linking the recipe in chat. But the more people gathered, the quieter he got. Until he spoke no more. 
---
For the next week, any of his group ads were followed by "Don't group with X! He's a known ninja!". He struggled to fill his own groups for days until he stopped advertising. I still saw him in dungeons, but he most likely got someone else to advertise for him because otherwise he stood no chance.
---
Well, I hope it was all worth it for the Recipe.
---
A few weeks later, one of the people who defended him wiped a group over Recipe: Flask of the Titans. He apparently has Alchemy on his alt and thus feels entitled to a Recipe on his main. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I generally don't die on my way. Playing on Earthfury.
---
This has happened to me so many Times.. what is The logic of them game at this situation? 50/50 roll? Or what?
---
You’ve heard of PvE servers, right?
---
Oh, well I guess I’ve never tried the / command, ever.  
---
TIL
---
keeping a r4 renew up (as Priest) on your WL is the easiest and most mana efficient way to keep a WL at full mana all the time.     
---
Using a greater heal or similar costs a ton of mana, using low rank hots costs almost nothing but gets 100% healpower scaling over 15s.    
---
Beeing efficient counts a lot more then starting mana regen once you get gear. MP5 stats and infight mana regen are a thing.
---
They hyped died down, and pvp is currently a bit of a shitshow.
---
I think when bgs drop it should help
---
...thank God for that at least. I was mentally preparing to encounter individuals who always had the perfect response and 360% improved area awareness with no weakness in their combat, meaning not only would I have to out-gear them, I would also have to play flawlessly to have a chance of victory while praying to the RNG gods for an edge in battle.

---
Southwind Breeze was **founded June 2019**, born from the hype for World of Warcraft Classic - we could not contain our excitement anymore! Our name was inscribed in the list of chartered guilds, and our site and Discord were launched. We’ve been searching back through the archives to bring together a team of primarily great friends and quality players. Our roster includes many Classic Veterans, as well as more recent arrivals to the World of Warcraft universe. 
---
Our people are our biggest asset - Southwind Breeze is an inclusive community which was born from multiple friendship groups coming together, to form new bonds. We have a wealth of experience, from realm first raiders to arena grandmasters. We understand that you have a job, a family, other passions - and that’s why our schedule and attendance rules will not interfere with your life outside of World of Warcraft. 
---
We want to continue to build a community that can enjoy the game without the constraints of a traditional hardcore guild. With this in mind, we aim to be a **casual guild with hardcore results.** By keeping the quality of player high, we are a home for all those who want to experience and succeed at Classic World of Warcraft on a real life timetable. 
---
We are primarily **UK based**, and our founding members were groups of friends from Liverpool and Newcastle. To this day, we have over 90 members from the UK, and a handful more from Europe, and this number is ever growing. That being said, we extend our membership to all players from the EU. All are welcome to apply and we encourage you to bring your friends.
---
**Raiding Schedule**
---
**Wed &amp; Thurs8-11** **UK │** **9-12 Server -** extra content Sunday/Monday (non-mandatory guild events)
---
**Recruitment Approach**
---
When it comes to recruiting new members, we’re first and foremost looking for people with the vibe to fit in to our social community. Preserving our social vibe is more important to us than your server fist kills or vanilla experience. We’re happy to accept almost anyone who understands and embraces this, and who wants to contribute towards a guild and community that spans further than just World of Warcraft. You’ll need a discord account progress your application, as we use this for all communication and organising.
---
**RECRUITMENT STATUS (Demand):**
---
**Warrior – Low/Medium**
---
**Rogue – Low**
---
**Warlock – Low**
---
**Druid (Resto) – Low/Medium**
---
**Hunter – Closed**
---
**Mage – Low**
---
**Paladin (Holy) – Medium**
---
**Priest (Holy) - Medium**
---
If your class is closed we still welcome any and all applicants who want to join us for our community and off days, which will include great raiding, PVP and other events. Given that we value attendance, preparation, commitment and skill, there are always opportunities to progress from a more casual position to a raiding position and our door is always open to socials.
---
**Loot Distribution**
---
The loot system that we're running is a version of DKP called EPGP. EPGP matches our values very well, providing a fair and balanced system for both the hard-core and the less hard-core. There are no crazy bidding wars as items will have a set DKP value determined by stats. The person with the highest DKP wins the item and pays the value of the item. On top of EPGP, we will run a very simple Core raider prio list. This list will only include very few selected items, ensuring that they they stay in the hands of the active and committed.
---
Too apply, visit the website listed above or if you require more information, add Xido#1269 on discord and I'll get back to you.

LF Daytime US guild
---
Looking for US WoW classic guild which is active during the day time.  I currently an expat whom resides overseas, in Europe, but play on US servers.  I would like to join a guild which is active during my time frames.  I play nearly every evening Central European Time, which basically daytime in the US.  I currently have characters on Thunderfury Alliance but willing to reroll (any faction, PVP/PVE) on another realm for the right guild.  
---
Please shoot me a message if you have or know of such a guild.  Thanks!
---
"the game is dying"
---
well, If I havent heard that one since 2006
---
Oof. Well I guess some of your priests will be happy.
---
I see. I was wrong about the mage-thingy.
---
I play a prot warrior very well and I love it. But goddamn do I get lost a lot and you bet people bitch about it. But the good thing is, I'm a tank that gets instantly invited to groups, so I'll just drop group if anyone starts giving me shit.
---
I quit to prepare for 8.3 the raid looks great. Maybe that's some people too
---
Same thing happened with me, the Carved Ogre Idol or whatever in retail, I actually opened that from the TCG years ago and redeemed it on my account, it was stuck on one character and I opened a few GM tickets to see if I could move it to diff chars, they declined. Now it's under the "Toy Box" so all chars have access and it's a 10 minute Transformation into an Ogre with a 10 minute cooldown. 
---
They've removed this Card now and replaced it with a 5 minute transformation with a 30 min CD, so the one I have is super super rare and worth a lot (The 5 min use, 30 min CD is like £100)
---
New player here, as a horde lock level 33: are there any good daggers/1H swords I can use? I’ve seen some good off-hand items but no good Daggers to play with. I’ve been stuck with the crescent staff since level 20.
---
If you can´t use potions or your ingi stuff constantly you can basically stand still and just wait until you die. Thats a solid fact. Any half decent mage who back paddles away will kite you to death. 
---
I personally use a free action potion and hope for some lucky crits before that poor clothi realizes that I have FAP up and sheeps me to just wait it out. 
---
If you did choose warrior for 1vs1 or 2vs1 cause you saw some nice vids on [warcraftmovies.com](https://warcraftmovies.com) you got tricked except you have insanely good gear which I assume that you don´t have if you don´t even find the time to grind some gold (lionhearts helm etc.). 
---
A warrior without gold, without potions, without arms spec .... get yourself a healer friend. Really.. every healer that you see flirt with him until one gets stuck with you and then hope he doesn´t leave the game.
---
The playerbase is losing the players that went on a pvp realm without really thinking about what that meant. 
---
Call me a narcissist, but if it wasn't this, it'd be some other element of classic that sent them packing. Its not for everyone and the hype is well and truly over. The alternative is making the game easier and more balanced and that path lead to current.
---
In the end only the players that truly enjoy it for what it is will be left and that's absolutely fine.
---
You think you do but you dont
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one?
---
This game was never meant for everyone, the influx of players overestimating themselves was way more than most of us expected.
---
Some were burnt out by leveling, some were burnt out by being ganked, some will burn out by inability to progress their pvp ranks, some will be tired by gold grind when BWL/AQ40 are released.
---
Current servers are full with \~15k players limit, since vanilla servers were about 3k roughly, we can afford to lose a lot of people until popular servers start feeling it.
---
I'd recommend Mirage Raceway. I'm there and it's OK!
---
BGs are far more efficient honor so yes this will happen.  
---
Obviously there's still open world PvP but no more lowie hunting as of now, or at least a lot less
---
I stopped playing because I couldn't just get on with a class well enough, due to overarching design philosophies. 
---
I also started playing originally back in the TBC era, having said that... I have no interest in TBC Classic. So I'd vote for Shadowlands. Wrath Classic however...
---
You can only queue from capital cities, and it won't be long enough to fly to their favorite gank spot.
---
Warlocks tapping is exactly what speeds the dungeon up.
---
Ideally you top off and hot as the group is about to pull and drink while they kill trash, not standing up until the tank actually needs healing
---
Speak to your guild and explain. 
---
When I Mained during TBC we started putting together a ‘B team’ for raiding, but made sure to put a few officers in charge of it. They were in control, and knew when we were lacking. Swap a few less geared players into your main raid and take a few of the best geared players for the b team. 
---
If they want to make it a competition then the B team will get sick of it
---
lord generals sword
---
druids are probably the class with the """""easiest"""" time in such a situation. Stealth, native bonus speed, extremely fast swimmer (you can escape everyone if a river is nearby) and heal+ton of escape tool make them very good at escaping someone
---
that's something they might change if it becomes/stays an issue though.
---
a fap you say?
---
then we shouldn't be playing on the patch that added that.  You can't even enter gadzetan because the guards are level 57 that die instantly or get feared
---
The tank is the leader/guide of the group.. Noone else should be going first other than the tank.
---
Sorry to hijack post, but I’ve a question regarding gold and whether to buy/save. 
---
I’ve just hit 60 on my rogue and sitting around 300 gold after respeccing and getting my 60 abilities. 
---
I have the devilsaur set and pre bis neck. I don’t really fancy the major headache which comes with farming the dal rends swords so I’m also thinking of going for Krol blade. I am super casual and am not in a raiding guild or anything like that.
---
Should I farm gold for epic mount then farm more gold for krol blade? Should I attempt to get into groups for pre bis pieces (this is a nightmare currently due to the roaming Zerg groups camping) or go for krol blade then mount??
---
BiS is BiS.
---
Someone willing to grind out 7 spell power over hundred of hours will be getting the remaining BiS pieces as well. Gold will only get you so far, so if you truly care for BiS, grinding specific content is the way forward.
---
jump out from the goblin hill in the west
---
It is a thing, and the answer is: a while. A fast group will probably take 3 hours if you’re doing everything and you’re in the middle of the level bracket. A slow group can take upwards of 5.
---
Other people’s results may vary, but it’s super fucking long. IIRC Mara was the first dungeon Blizzard made, so it’s visually very beautiful and clearly they spent a lot of time on it. That being said, it’s so long that after you clear it you get an item to skip ~60% of it so you don’t have to repeat the shit that people don’t want to do.
---
That being said, Mara is one of my favorite dungeons just because it’s pretty with all the waterfalls and dungeon design, it just takes forever to clear because it’s so damn big.
---
I got the onyxia buff on my lvl 12 warrior the other day. Felt like I'm supermake, one-shotting mobs on my level. :D
---
Hey i'm pretty sure i was there! It was super cool. Like, a mexican standoff until 2 other people and I decided to go flank them on the right. We blizzarded right in their middle while the rest charged. it was awesome!
---
Earthfury after the last wave of transfers is definitely alliance heavy
---
Gadzetan guards level 57
---
That's what I thought, so mine had pretty much the same thing. But I did cut discs of the sausage, didn't cross my mind it might be as you suggested... well I don't think my chili suffered from that, but I'll keep it in mind!
---
I believe in classic you do not need to go to the actual bg area - there are currently battle masters in every major city. They will queue the group for a BG
---
Are they planning to kick the lot of you, or something? If you do split runs for loot, you want them equally capable.
---
indeed! but if it's not the magic "infinite mana" item that I want on the mage, I woudln't even attempt it.
---
You do realize you can just keep other items, right? You can have Valor legs + Battlechaser in your bank in case you need to replace Dragonscale shoulders.
---
Dragonscale is BiS right now because the set bonuses are just that good. It's also relatively cheap. Not using BiS because you'd have to change more than 1 piece on an upgrade is a bit silly.
---
Is this farm doable as a 56 prot pally ?
---
GET IT!
---
The chimera chops are definitely on the list for me as well, me and the gf loved the Shoveltusk steaks!
---
Literally had the same thing go down last night... 
---
Raid leader: don't forget your amulet
---
1st timer: why do I need an amulet, I did the attunement
---
Watch Frostadamus’ ZF video and there’s a frostfire spec in the middle, also Nogar’s ZF video, which is this spec all the way through. The method consists of Frost Nova -&gt; Flamestrike + CoC, then CoC again until your Nova is back up. I find it a lot safer than Blizzard, because a resist doesn’t fuck you up, but it’s harder to get the ranges right at the beginning.
---
So because the guy is in the raid and part of the kill, they are not allowed to roll on gear that is just as much an upgrade to them? No trinkets, no cloak, no rings, necks? Why should a frostbolt spamming mage be more deserving to someone who came as a healer, healed the raid for what exactly? They are "fully geared" why would anyone show up to a raid, to spend an hour there killing bosses to not even get a chance at loot? That sounds pretty stupid to me.
---
Thanks dude, it felt so great!
---
A GM named Cowsmoke of Notorius on Fairbanks US is excluded from from DKP and takes whatever gear he wants with no DKP loss and even took Toep before the casters as a resto shaman for himself. His logic is he deserves it for his "hard work" but he is also allowed first pick at any loot he wants.
---
I don’t think it’s abusing the system or a glitch. Mind control is in the game for a reason. And it’s not like this is any worse than a group of 5+ ganking one person.
---
I was lowkey hoping he would die and I would get the last hit on the boss....
---
Damn, you went the extra mile. Those cases I just try to use non-verbal communication and hope for the best. FFXIV has an auto translate feature that I wish WoW would copy so bad. Granted for NA it’s not common I run into language barriers, but still would be nice to have for those times I do.
---
Fuck you.
---
Im not assuming that. Even if you have full pre raid bis you are still better off farming gold with all those hours or pvping if you want to maximize your efficiency,  rather than going for an item that will be replaced relatively quickly. "Of X wrath" items arent worth it. Whos gonna be in a better position? A mage that spent 200 or 300 or whatever hours farming DM for gold or a mage that had 7 more frost spell damage that got outdated in 2 weeks? In 3 weeks they will have the same gear but the farming mage has much more gold to spend on consumes pots nades and sappers.
---
Time for a break then.
---
You lost 3 comments ago.
---
do dungeons and wait for BGs to launch on Dec 10
---
Everyone who's even remotely serious enough to care about BiS lists probably has been working on Lionheart for a while!
---
It's a weird US thing. To me sausage is the whole sausage, same as for you.
---
The filling is rather minced meat to me...
---
Yeah just a quick 30 second fap.
---
I haven't played retail since cata but are you saying they removed lifetap from certain lock specs? And if so who thought that was a good idea?
---
This is how i do it (dont need to bother no1 to reset the instance)
---
i go in on my mage and do the room (i dont bother with satyrs - just lashers and herbs in the lashers room, this takes me around 8 minuts) and clear it. i logoff and go to my alt for 5 minuts, and then i log on mage and im at the entrance of the dungeon, get out, reset and in [again.fast](https://again.fast) and i never get locked down from doin to many instances.
---
Confirmed?
---
Nah the group of people on skeram doing this know that more alliance are likely to fight in this location. So its more fun and everyone gets more honor.
---
I assumed lager, it has a little note on the page that says "any beer will do, just don't choose one that's too hoppy" so I just assumed that meant normal not-too-bitter lager. Ales, stouts etc. have too much of a taste to them and might be overwhelming imo.
---
bro, thats all i have been able to do for 10 levels already, any sort of quest has alliance, and alliance are scary!!!
---
Band of Sulfuras
---
2 X Legplates of Wrath
---
Essence of Pure Flame
---
A few other items but I don't remember.
---
No, the problem is his guilds are ran like shit and filled with bad players who just want to be on his stream for 3 seconds
---
Make sure to grab Blackrock spire fire resistance buff and everyone in the raid has 2 GFPPs, this will help a ton! Good luck!
---
I love how Horde on here is slowly changing the goalpost to claim that outnumbering the other faction 60:40 is somehow in the realm of balanced. 66-33 is literally 2:1, 60:40 means that for every 10 players of faction B in a zone, there are 15 players of faction A, meaning that B loses the vast majority of skirmishes over questing areas. But sure. Even tho it's much closer to a literal 2:1 ratio than actual balance, that's "relatively balanced".
---
Also illusionary rod. I'm assuming the dagger is better though
---
Haha this was better than any match of [INSERT FAVORITE BR GAME HERE].
---
it does a hidden reroll and winner gets the item i believe
---
Thanks Shermzmx!
---
Disclaimer: I'm not a noob but I know little.
---
I'm playing a warr and prefer 2h dps to tanking. I refrain from using abilities that say "generates high amount of threat" whilst DPSing, but does aoe cleave/whirlwind hinder tank threat gains?
---
Does anyone have a working Hunter FD+trap macro to share?
---
My search only brings up posts about ones that don’t work.
---
Problem is there's no transfers to PvE as of now. To a lot of people the option between re-rolling and quitting is the same as no sane person would drop their character with months of progress.
---
Try Google Docs / Forms, I don’t think it has the same limitation. 25 is not a large enough sample size to be statistically significant.
---
Though maybe you could write a paper on how many responses you would need to be statistically significant.
---
Could you explain what a jump run is? As a gold starved warrior, I'm always looking for ideas.
---
Lol, so much this. I started playing wow to play with my friends and leveling for me feels like I am not driving to the court but rather jumping there on one leg in a dangerous neighborhood making honking sounds.
---
Asking the real questions. I only use up to shift-5...
---
Sword of zeal is the best preraid MH (excluding teebu's of course) if you don't have both dalrends and it is often cheaper than krol.
---
Rogues! Didn't even want honour .Whats the great song?
---
Exactly.
---
https://youtu.be/k3OGrrMKHr4
---
It still generates threat and is better than swipe at low levels
---
The part where progression happens so that they release Burning Crusade, and WotLK afterwards.
---
But once you have the best lvl 49 gear that's it, you don't ever have to get any new gear. If you're level 60 you're going to have to be constantly  upgrading your gear as new phases come out etc.
---
Meanwhile Kazzak dies before a second guild even makes it there, every time.
---
In MC clearing trash, i always throw a rejuvemation on locks as soon as the pull dies so we can keep the tempo up. Wheres my live aid, right?
---
Sell it on eBay. Chuck it in the mail.
---
No, I encountered a loot whore. He joined, played and geared as healer.
---
I learned the spirit healer thing the hard way when trying to ress in moonglade.
---
I mean — a few times I actually fought someone my lvl I enjoyed it but I wouldn't say that getting gangbanged by higher lvls while questing is pvp
---
Boy do I love this game but also hate this game :P
---
When efficiency doesn't equal fun but thats still what everyone does. Seems like a lot of people will get burned out, pun intended.
---
Gl then
---
It is going to be a substantial blow to my professional career if they rerelease BC.
---
Make shift and scroll forward into a pet totem killing macro while backward is your pet "stay". And then ctrl and scroll to be your zoom.
---
While I'm at it, the only macros I really use are the all in one pet macros, a summoning macro to whisper my target and say who I'm summoning, drain life/drain mana macro to prevent recasting it while channeling and the usual Shoot macro for your wand.
---
Aaah don't worry son. You'll be able to grow a beard soon.
---
I wouldn't trust them on the technical side it's really easy to fuck up. Iam sure there is a discord for this kind of thing, maybe ask around
---
The debuff slot is very much worth it from what I've heard.
---
It won't make them shorter.
---
Just got our first Guildies-only rag last night too! And my first ever :) what a feeling!
---
The alliance players aren't getting even close to the zergfest that the Horde puts up in every lvl 50+ zone. The logical conclusion that follows is that most have already given up, which is bad news for the Zerg too.
---
Uhh. I'm missing something here. How can shamans increase group damage 15%..20%?
---
Yep. 
---
Anytime either faction has the advantage, they’re going to exploit it. I’ve been trapped in BB because a group of alli are camping outside multiple times. Stuck inside grom’gol. Can’t grab nessy quests. Etc etc. bUT HoRDe iS uNfAIr
---
Lol, that is fantastic.
---
The druid caught my eye because it is very versatile and I like that aspect, but I'll think about warriors and rogues, thanks. What makes them fun in your opinion?
---
What's a banwave? Don't bliz ban people realtime?
---
Damn you got me haha
---
I'm still wondering if Death Ray damage scales with anything at all or if it's entirely random. Some older wowhead comments speculate that either stamina, engineering skill or maybe just the level itself may influence it.
---
I think it's random.
---
I did after the fact.
---
Sounds like I should split the dungeon up into several runs =). Questing is a no-go anyways these days. Im on Firemaw EU so sadly I cannot join you but I appreciate the offer! I will look forward to the nice scenery of the dungeon =)
---
You think you want to use them, but you don´t!
---
After seeing all the comments above I realize I've been somewhat gearing an ele shaman while being specced as an enhancement. This makes the swap that much more viable 😁
---
First, seal fate will do you no good at this point.  
---
It is an endgame spec and you need to be crit capped for this build to work, do some research.
---
Second, as others have mentioned, without prep, your chances to win reduce drastically.  
---
I am a pve combat specced rogue(swords) and the only way for to win against a mage is to force Ice Block and make sure blink is on CD, then I unload CD's and I have to melt him down before blink goes up again, and it doesn't work every time.  
---
You are a rogue, chose your fights.
---
[Gooooold for sail!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgg9fQwY-0Q)
---
Try finding macros that quickly use your pet abilities in PvP, like devour magic on yourself when feared or polymorphed.
---
&gt; DPS will rarely opt to nuke the non-elites or casters first
---
This is why I have to skull and X non-elites and people still don't attck them half the time. If my focus is on keeping normal mobs off the healer, you can die to that elite mob youre focusing, you deserve it asswipe.
---
Seriously, this is one of the most annoying, simple, things people don't do.
---
Tdlr: I can't farm fly path all day, there is a mean priest stealing all my HK.
---
This is clearly an abuse from the priest side, but common you are sitting here all day every day. Maybe go on some real pvp venture on non honorless target.
---
Depends what you're playing on, I can hit shift+0 easily on my laptop keyboard and the smaller keyboard I use for work, but I wouldn't stand a chance on my gaming keyboard.
---
It also depends how often they use the skill, I have some dodgy keybinds for skills i only use very rarely or that have massive cooldowns because i want the reachable ones for more commonly used skills. They could also just be using right shift and moving their hands if it's only something they use in an emergency, that doesn't exactly cost much time to pop your hand along and back to WASD
---
More likely though they just copied the default keybinds with shift for the bottom left action bar and might not even use the hotkey.
---
This has been the move for getting to ZF lol
---
I'd wager a guess at rogue+druid tribute farming. You should be able to stealth past most things by having the other player on follow, and healing on last boss isn't very APM intensive.
---
This is reddit, people read the first 3 words and start typing an angry reply
---
I've watched Staysafe on Twitch farm Maraudon countless times. He's killed the Princess well over 400 times so far and hasn't seen a single Blade drop.
---
I wish you luck in your endeavours to get it.
---
if your guild is primarily a PvE guild, then loot rules and priorities should reflect that. A primarily PvP guild will have loot rules that make it easier for people to get their PvP gear.
---
A PvE guild will prioritize getting loot to the classes/specs that favour PvE progression.
---
If your friend is a pvp player raiding in a primarily PvE guild (sounds like it since they prioritize mages and locks for caster gear), then he should maybe consider looking for a PvP guild instead?
---
This. Just bring a sapper charges and enjoy the honor shower.
---
Was it an player or a civilian npc?

---
Thank you again. As I mentioned above I've been getting int gear thinking I needed that as enh shaman. Fail. Lol. I am honestly geared as an ele using an enh spec tree the more I read the comments. Once I get my mount it'll be time to swap. I have a beast shield to use when I reach level 39 anyway with a lot of spirit. Can you recommend any 1 H axes for an ele shaman? I'm an orc so I'd like to stick to axes.
---
Last night I found a buyer for a ZF boost, and had to farm shards before the run. So I went to Un'Goro. It was a warzone, I died at least 5 times and fought more alliance than i fought mobs. Even 50's tried to jump me for w/e reason. 
---
Unlike a lot of other players, I'm actually enjoying this. The world seems alive, and you can see lots of players doing things here and there everywhere. I'm afraid with BG's it will be dead, with 90% of server pop chilling in cities.
---
Ah I see, I guess I just misunderstood.
---
Unreal, I spent literally an hour trying to figure out how to do this. Thinking it was a different addon. Thank you
---
Beyond Memory by NINA
---
You can begging BRD run. 
---
it's also possible to begin those instance a bit before the required level stated here but you need to be with guildes since it will require to kill more mobs and the run will be longer.
---
This is the start of p2 and all this complaints are a sympton of the classic experience I wanted to see. You might only see a gray screen, but when I corpserun from TP to BRD I see max lvl horde players grouping up, having fun and grinding honor with all the competition around them.
---
Is this different for other classes? Cause as a warrior I ress when I see a horde in my path, I hug (charge) him, and try to hug (intercept) another till I have to walk with all my other ally spirits from TP again. 
---
I mean, thats better than ressing when the only horde around is a stealthed stunlock rogue and you only moved a few steps. But even he is racing for the kill for a pom pyro mage might take half his contribution points.
---
BG's are coming, but this phase definitely gets the max lvl players out of the capitals and into the world pvp. Its great to see classic so lively.
---
Need before greed. If someone needs a BoE, don't need it so you can sell it, that's way more selfish.
---
Also makes sure only those two get honor. No1 else can attack the MCd target.
---
If you plan on pvp battleground go for the epic mount. I feel alterac would be frustrating on a normal mount.
---
If you pve only, the lionheart Helm. 
---
But keep mind, that our warriors bought the Helm and a week later it dropped from ony.
---
you've just described the full range of what I am going through lol. I want to use them so badly and don't want to at the same time haha
---
Literally everyone can use boes even if just to ah. Don’t be that douch that tries to ninja with need roles and you won’t be called out.
---
First time playing? Oohhh I don't think so mofo, you do know people can see your post history right?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyyec6/i_just_gotta_get_good_right/?st=k3edye1c&amp;sh=5ee322b7

BTW why do you want to skip the game to get to end game just so you can encounter the same problems
---
funny how i did this farm on my mage and i got the exact same epics - not at the same run but the exact same ones
---
Could a 56 priest do it too or too low still?

I fish on my 2nd account while I farm gold on my main. It's easy enough to do that I can do whatever gold farming method I want on my main, like DM East, and just add fishing for some extra gold per hour.

Are 48+? Can you level in any 48+ zone on your server?

Why would you both make it worse for your own faction, and additionally take the risk of transferring to a future dead server when BG's come out in 2 weeks time? Once BG's come out all will be fixed. This is how it has been on every pserver.

Yes you can, you are in control over which parses you upload and which ones you dont.

Bye
---
One option:
---
Prot paladin + mage AOE
---
Paladin gathers up mobs. Uses holy shield + boSanctuary + retri aura + consecration to build aggro.
---
Mage channels blizzard on top of the pack.
---
There's mage water+food to recover between pulls.
---
Probably best done in instances, since you need a bunch of mobs to group up - preferably melee (possibly casters/ranged if you can use LOS to group them up).

A reroll obviously. So many people get salty when this happens but it's just the same as if you'd roll again.
---
This specific case is pretty funny, though.

Ashkandi, level 24.

19 has too much competition. 49 is the untapped well for people to gank with a conscience.

Do you just fish between bosses? I can't imagine switching attention to click the float mid-fight, since DM:E bosses are quite unforgiving to fuckups.
---
PvP happening =/= unplayable game
---
Before release, there was so many post about how world PvP was amazing, stories of epic battles and how fun SS-TM was. In the midst of all of this the people warning that PvP was not that fun, un-balanced and casual were just fodders were quickly dimissed as carebears or players that didn't understand the brillance of Classic who should go back to retail.

Frankly I totally understand how people who didn't spend all days on forums bought the hype and thought it was gonna be a lot more fun that what we're living. 
---
In my opinion the problem is that not many people wants to play a mode where the opposite faction can 'steal' a plant in front of you while /spit on you without the possibility to attack nor they want a mode where bored a group of hardcore players can stop lvl30 to do anything during an afternoon just for fun.
---
It's one of the thing that should have been fixed in classic with a smart blend of PvE and PvP
---
Mine works out of the box. I have heal prediction, but I didn't install this addon.
---
If you’re clearing it quickly you can get away with it but in our raid rogues need to respec, as much as it sucks.
---
Mining will kickstart your gpm - you need to do the last boss and mine for solo jump runs to be efficient.
---
Lol sorry to insult your cult surrounding asmon.
---
Romanian?
---
Yesterday a warrior cried and left because we all needed the trash drop of an epic mace worth 400gold. Random pug dungeon.
---
I’m curious to why you say no to transmog.
---
In this very specific circumstances he wouldn't. I for one could've live without epic mount, but someone who only plays 2 hours/day and mostly raidlog, and dont pvp, that guy wont have that much use of an epic mount.
---
I'm standing on the roof and just zoomed the camera out very far.
---
There's a large area outside the instance. 2 of the quests are completed there, and one of them is both outside + 1 inside.
---
Instance groups tends to skip those since they just want to get inside asap. It's possible to solo all three, including the one from the centaur pariah (you only need to kill two mobs inside, and get them alone with some patience).
---
Oh, so ninjas just have "different opinions about loot rules" and are fully entitled to take whatever they want?
---
if the queues aren't too crazy
---
Ive had loads during my slow levelling myself
---
I will sometimes not heal wl, even when i could spare the mana. Especially gnomes.
---
Sorry, but its just to funny whatching gnome wl die.
---
It's the best aoe damage spell in the game!
---
Why are you spreading misinformation?
---
The realm is as even as you are gonna get, as a Horde, 8/10 times i land in Thorium Point i get assfucked by 10 alliance camping the FP.
---
10/10 times im walking through the Bulwark in WPL i get  buttfucked by 10 Alliance.
---
If you are struggling with PvP on Mograine you are way better off rerolling PvE
---
Gratz !!! My first onyx clear i was off off tank and the last one alive :)
---
I have similar setup with item rack, i dunno why you can't do this.
---
Dont think pala can tank ad many mobs, as mage could kill solo
---
I do believe so, but as I said... I am having trouble with last boss + I'd have to respec, so... just to offset that, it should take 3 hours of farming for "free".
---
No one cares, He was there just like you.
---
I've made it from 48-54 with my hunter on Thunderfury, but it's definitely been slow going.  I essentially rolled a PVE Warlock while gathering rested exp on my hunter, then just grind in Winterspring/Azsheara.  Any questing area just leads to multiple deaths.
---
Funny part is the PVP on the PVE server has been 10x more enjoyable with huge, even, battles going on.  Meanwhile, the horde will gank me 10 times on PVP, I rally the troops, take them out once, then 50 of them show up after one death.  I'm definitely staying on PVP cause it was highly enjoyable pre phase 2 and I'm hoping for similar results during phase 3.
---
Until then, PVE it is with rested exp once in awhile.
---
Most of the overall heat is better than what will be available from pvp.
---
Roll on the known streamer server, then complain about streamers? Next level
---
That's a surprisingly high amount of salt
---
Hello fellow feral tank.
---
It depends on two things:
---
\- Your gear. Mainly hit rating is important as you will face higher level mobs and bosses.  
---
\- Your healer. You need a geared main spec healer with some gear. When you lose aggro (because you miss maul two times in a row for instance), your healer will need to cover up.
---
I would say BRD 57, LBRS 58, Strat/Scholo 59 and UBRS (MT) 60.
---
Xir
---
I know the post is 2 days old but I just have to comment on the fact that it feels as though there is less of a social element on the PvE servers vs the PvP servers particularly while leveling. Why? Because you don't need your buddies to assist you against the opposite faction so you're just there to leech XP and while you provide a little more protection from the mobs themselves, it's usually better especially in the case of item loot quests to simply do them yourself.  
---
That being said, i did transfer PRIOR to the Phase 2 release so there's obviously the "held hostage by Horde" issue that the OP mentioned now in PVP servers but at least on Myzrael? It felt like I was playing solo at times.
---
Wed. 8 AM
---
Also that reduction of enemy power and armor, instagib moonfire, roots, immunity to poly and roots...every druid ability is op in its own way
---
Nah, you're horde so you're all good.
---
That tool is awesome. I was farming Eye of Shadow for my Benediction (the Succubus can be solo'd even as Disc if you abuse LoS) and I got the drop way earlier than expected so decided to kill a few more. I got really lucky and a second Eye of Shadow dropped, but it wasn't until this point that I realised they were unique so I couldn't loot the second one! 
---
I remembered about the item restoration tool and decided to take a punt, I deleted the original Eye from my bag and then looted the second one, formed my Benediction after a trip to EPL to get the splinter, and then used the item restoration tool to restore the first Eye of Shadow and sold it for 400g.
---
 #1 would probably find a PvP oriented guild who you can premake BGs with, some tier items until that won't hurt
---
That's an UD + Rogue combo for you.
---
and have some other dipshits mindlessly attack the target anyways. you prevent that via mind control.
---
Well that escalated
---
i was wondering how the top ppl were getting 100k + honor this week when i can barely find ppl to kill jeez
---
Awesome! Thanks for the heads up =D
---
There is no need to be upset
---
For you.
---
We wiped on Domo just 2 weeks ago, last week we downed him for the first time and yesterday everything went a lot smoother.
---
I feel like our biggest problem right now is getting geared up (mostly FR gear) and not being reliant on PuGs.   
---
We'll get there, our ranks are slowly growing (our guild didn't exist and was built from the ground up by a few of my friends when Classic started). Once we got a decent raiding pool built up progression will be a lot easier. :)
---
Okay but now you're shitting on me for having different opinions about loot rules... So congratulations?
---
Sub is just fine for MC. You shouldn't have to respec unless your guild is struggling to clear. I've been raiding sub the last 3 weeks without any issues. Just make sure you grab improved slice and dice and you can keep sub spec until BWL.
---
For reference, I did 460 dps on golemagg last week.
---
It's easy? Post your logs first then talk? No? No i didn't think so.
---
With that rotation I'm usually good on dps. Can be top. Tank has to be 2h and a few levels above me to out damage usually.
---
That's neat. I still can't fathom why they thought it was a good idea to make tradeable items unique.
---
Sword of Zeal is better and cheaper.
---
I am looking forward when those guys that are already lvl 60 moved on. I am lvl 30 now and will hit lvl 60 in may or june.
---
Sooner or later the "We need to hurry everything" guys will be gone. The "efficient guys" will be gone. The people thinking doing the content "fast" will be gone. The people rushing it will be gone.
---
Blizzard will merge servers in that time. I am really looking forward the time when all those people that are playing too much and take this too seriuous are gone back to retail.
---
The server is still balanced. People on your server, and alliance in general dont pvp. You wont find a better server, and def not a server you are looking for. Unless you want a 90/10 alliance one.
---
Didn’t know virginity was a career
---
That's a huge assumption. Why, what happens after 1 min?
---
Right, but he didn't specify that. Most of the time is spent at max level.
---
This addon has been invaluable for me: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/server-friends-only/
---
What is the recommended hit chance going against Onyxia and Rag?
---
Guess its becomes inbalanced when players like you shouldve rolled PVE in the first place.
---
If you got a friend make sure one of you can heal, so any hybrid will make life so much easier
---
"Kek"
---
I was more thinking of it being a core warlock ability, something that separates a lock from other classes. I'm assuming with what I've heard about the next expansion they'll be adding it back in.
---
He's a very nice guy actually.
---
At this point just let them raid as PvP spec, is it really going to hinder your ability to kill bosses on MC?
---
We're allowing PvP specs in raid til BWL - maybe bosses die a few seconds slower but that's the only impact. Plus a lot of happy players.
---
The only thing that you should be getting is the SoR dmg on all 5 hits. The extra hits from Reckoning dont and shouldnt be able to proc any other effects, only your first "main" swing is able to proc other effects.
---
Weak Auras for most of the stuff you see. Make a new group, allign the display target to the nameplate and edit as you wish.
---
Or start with [https://wago.io/FjHDGH86l](https://wago.io/FjHDGH86l) \+ OmniCC
---
If I was in charge of loot distribution, I wouldn't give any more items to a mage that doesn't enchant his mageblade.
---
For all the condescension for months by PvP players that PvE realms wouldn't be "the real game,"  this sub has been non-stop gratification for me over the past 2 weeks.  Many of us who rolled on PvE servers predicted the current state of "PvP" and opted out of it.  If this 27 is your highest level character, You're not too far in I'd suggest rerolling.  
---
There were numerous warnings and if you had no idea it would be like this, you only have yourself to blame.
---
I was watching them camp that short valey, then alliance pushed them from booth sides, and then all the groups went into the dungeon. It is like waves. Sometimes wave od hordes come and push, sometimes alliance. It is fun to watch these waves to happen. Not fun when 30 horde wipes you from the planet xd
---
Weak Auras edited to our needs.  
---
Start with [https://wago.io/FjHDGH86l](https://wago.io/FjHDGH86l)
---
As high as possible, as always. It depends on your dps, so talk to them. Make friends with the two or three guys who are topping the meters and ask them if they're needing to hold back. If they tell you they need to stop DPS every 30 seconds, then you need more hit chance.
---
You don't need that. There is GDC. If you cannot click 2 buttons in 1,5 seconds then you might aswell stop playing
---
does taurens have extra 2 yard range in classic ?
---
It's actually head+neck from princess, carried me until I had my preraid bis
---
Isnt the teleport bind on use?
---
Horde flair. Not surprised. Hate to tell you, but guards in everlook didn't give a damn when 5 hordes started attacking me, even tho I was friendly with them.
---
I bet.
---
Just lead him to the tower and then don't interfere at all, just watch. Do not aggro anything, do not heal him, do not attack anything.
---
Thanks mate! Point of having that clip is that warlock is part of the group following him and fighting afterwards, sorry, have a nice day.
---
ElvUI... This is a bit of a cheat since it's more of an "addon package" than a standalone addon but if you're lazy like me and want to overhaul most of your UI without getting a million addons to do it? This is the way to go since it adds actionbar manipulation, nameplates, bag consolidation, etc.  
---
Besides this, the standard DBM, Details, Questie and Auctioneer/TSM are "must-haves" with Spy being necessary if you're on a PVP server or want to engage in BG's when they drop and Gathermate if you're keen on professions and want to record rare node spawns locations to check later.  
---
You can quite easily survive with these mods alone IMO, i know that i have!
---
What he means is that you should use sunder on your first global as a DPS warrior so the tank can deal more damage with his higher threat abilitys (shield slam/bloodthirst, revenge, heroic strike).  
---
Sunder is just a filler and ragedump, the threat is not as high as people think.
---
Dagger is better. Locks also have the level 36-ish quest to get a blue off-hand item and that combo can easily last you until 60.
---
Sucks that he doesnt want to, but that's classic. I dont want to do raid attunements. They should remove it for me. /s
---
On stalagg too, respect
---
I was w-wonddering... None of the br1 on gehennas(most competitive server) on the alliance side used any of this shit and everyone is 250k. You either play on a super dead server or you're just dogshit. Stop making justifications for your failures and learn to play the game.  Yeah the mind control shit is lame but you can vanish/fd/trinket/invis etc.
---
So much this.. if it is an upgrade, let them have it. Skullflame shield dropped for me as I was tanking school. Unfortunately our warlock also rolled need and won. Luckily my teammates voiced their opinions and he gave it up but DAYUM when he rolled need and won I was pissed.
---
P3. P2 so far has been worse than BFA.
---
Druids fast as fuck boiiiiiiiiii, that's why they're good flag carriers
---
Haha, thank you! Wish you two the best!
---
Requires gnomish to actually use though, sadly. It’s one of the very few items that do.
---
Unless some new info has came out recently I don't think it was considered very good
---
Nice try 😉
---
Level 27 isn’t exactly months of progress
---
But see, this is bad practice. Instead of doing something against this mess, people must resort to hiding in dungeons. Now I'm a pve player, and I love instances, but that doesn't mean that I want to spend my next year exclusively inside brd or scholo.
---
And before any professional horde player jumps in: no. Killing me in thorium point with a 15 man raid cannot be solved by "get better or reroll"
---
Yes, but I DID specify that.
---
A large portion of time is spent leveling.
---
You are kinda dumb so I am just gonna put you on block, hope you have a good day though!
---
Man I really just wanted to see 8 hours of unedited footage of a lvl 36 traveling to org and then 10 seconds of the 1 duel he does before waiting another 30 min
---
Probably using a Naga or some equivalent.
---
This is not what PvP was like. This is completely broken in the current state.
---
“Invisibility” isn’t the same as “stealth”. So yeah, false sense of security is pretty accurate.
---
Tell that to whining pug raiders that don't want to sacrifice 40 minutes and prefer to wipe and not get a kill for 2 hours instead.
---
nocontext screenshots are always the best!
---
Someone doesnt know what the difference between invisibility and stealth is
---
I think if he's going to equip it he should have it. Upgrades &gt; gold
---
damn bro
---
I literally don’t watch streamers.
---
Get better dps...
---
I wasn't saying you're wrong, just adding. Maybe you should seek help.
---
I know it's way cheaper than flasking everybody, but using GFPP in the same sentence as cheap made me giggle.
---
I remember this exact same struggle with my guild in vanilla.
---
Last night we got him down to 30% and we survived phase 2 with a few people still alive. So I'm sure we can get him next week. :)
---
Hi,
---
I'd say it's worth getting it if you are done with the epic mount.
---
Until then, hold off I'd say. If you want cheaper upgrades, try to get the skullforge reaver from Strat UD or Sword of Zeal, if you can find it.
---
Cheers!
---
On my server the guild leader of an up and coming raid guild ninja bindings of windseeker in MC and then gquit immediately after and logged off. His guild kinda fell apart after that. I think he was like a hunter or something.
---
fake news. if you play on gehennas you know how bad it is
---
BWL  / AQ / Naxx  All of these were out of my reach in Vanilla.
---
Which is still blizzards problem and they knew from internal testing that this would be an issue and they went ahead and did it anyways. If they didn't do internal testing before spending millions on developing this client on this engine then that's even worse. 
---
It doesn't matter who's right about what the actual cause is, arguing about that is pointless. Blizzard screwed up astronomically. The large majority of the player base would probably not be as pissed if blizzard would just acknowledge the massive fuckup they've created.
---
You can customise the width and height of the players health bars in un-modded Wow settings.  You can scale them right down, show resource bar, sorting options etc.
---
&gt; Get your guild to help you.
---
this does not work when 80% of your guild raid logs and does not care about PVP
---
just pointing that out
---
Its about as gamebreaking as a 30sec zap of poly until the debuff wears off.
---
Pre-raid runs are generally easy enough that I've never found that to be an issue. Does rely heavily on your healer being both good and decent geared though, because you're going to be taking more damage.
---
Why did you pick a PvP server if you dont enjoy wPvP
---
F10 - how do you use that keybind lmao
---
1000 percent worth it. Been using krol for over 5 weeks now and have raided every week/ ony clear.. still never seen VK and lost BB twice!
---
I'd say you're being extremely selective about what you think the "problem" is here.
---
Man this is such a disappointing book. I’ve flipped through it when I was younger and it leaves a lot to be desired.
---
I’ve already made one. When you...
---
Log in: drink.
---
Find a group: drink.
---
Get ganked by 2 or less: drink.
---
Get ganked by 3 or more: smoke.
---
Search for a new group: drink.
---
Hearth out of a war zone: drink.
---
You DON’T get ganked landing at a fp: drink.
---
YOU gank a Horde player: drink. 
---
You gank 2+ Horde players: smoke.
---
Basically—just drink. And smoke. All night. Win!
---
No, you get it, but I don't think you're seeing my motivation. 
---
If other players are missing health, I can be pretty sure that it is because they are in danger. If warlocks are missing health then more often than not it's because they life tapped. In the midst of combat, when presented with 2 players with missing health I will choose the non-warlock as a rule of thumb.
---
I want to stress that this is a rule of thumb. If I see that the warlock is hellfiring because we need aoe then I'm going to heal them because I know they're pretty likely to be in more danger than anyone else.
---
The only time I refuse to heal a warlock is if doing so is going to force me to drink. Because the party is going to be slowed down anyways at that point.
---
I stopped reading after "pally" 🙄
---
FTH!
---
I have the side buttons on my mouse mapped to the f1-12 keys.
---
It's not a joke
---
No surprise. For what ever reason Vanilla private servers that had PVP Realms, always had excessive PVP going on.
---
That's why I specifically choose a PVE realm.
---
How? Isn't Herod overwhelmingly Horde?
---
this quest chain is also worth doing while leveling ... nets over 100k xp in total and except for the last part you can solo most of it (at least as a lock :D)
---
Looking for some fit guys to game with. Must be really fit and only talk about creatine, tanning and  veiny forearms.
---
6-8% would be ideal.  Difficult to obtain without Ony neck and Band of Accuria, whilst wearing FR gear.
---
Shadowblade is a pretty good weapon for leveling alts.
---
Good enough for a crusader enchant, makes the last 10 levels easy.
---
I found 2 freezing bands before I hit 60.
---
Oh thank god
---
We'll see. There still is world PvP, and battlegrounds are coming to everyone
---
That happens to me never
---
Why even bother posting when u clearly dont understand how the honor system works?
---
If classic dies it will be because blizzard failed to provede server quality. Not because of any fault in the game or the audience. 
---
I suspect that a year from now a dozen new private realms will pop up to replace classic. With servers that unlike classic can manage largescale pvp.
---
In addition to that, my attitude is that, if the tank messes up a pull by accident, it presents a fun challenge for me and my buds to use our CC skills to handle a messy pull. We’ve gotten out of a few tight spots because of that, the tank learns, and I get to use all the fun tools in my Hunter’s skill book :D
---
&gt; My first phone was a classic Nokia 3310. You were able to send SMS without looking in class. Can't do that as easily nowadays.
---
Haha aye, every time I tell youngsters that their jaws drop in pure envy. Marvelous!
---
It does, proc chance is so low ft still better
---
OK boomer
---
No doubt, but I do think it’s fair to say the dominance of horde leads to much more horde ganking and such than alliance.
---
To be fair, if the populations were reversed I’m sure the opposite would be true.
---
Im healer. I keep lock alive. Thats my job. I dont trade my mana to lock tho. If lock taps, i usually dont heal much. I only throw a HoT when my mana is almost full and i can spare some. I have heard that that is fine for locks. Correct me if im wrong.
---
The old saying is : a bot or not, it is paying customer, so blizz have no rush to ban.
---
"EZPZ" says one of the 38 dead people. :P
---
Seriously though well done. People trivialise MC because it's been deconstructed to death and servers are flooded with people who farmed the place on private servers, so it's nothing new to them.
---
Ragnaros and Majordomo are still challenging fights for a group that's mostly new to the place.
---
Yeah, they are not equal at all. Private server actually spend a lot of dev time on improving servers, Blizzard doesn't.
---
Why even have a rank option higher than 4 when its impossible to get higher yet?
---
The game is massively changed already.
---
Continently West was the one I did lol.
---
Careful, you might cut yourself with that edge.
---
So you're telling me, that after dying the FIRST time, and knowing they were going to continuously camp you. Why on earth did you go back?
---
That's weird. It should work even with adds remaining. His dad should come in about 5-10 seconds and just kill everyone.
---
Did you try removing the quest completely from your log and doing it over by taking it from Fordring in the castle while being in disguise?
---
Lol my key bindings are kinda wack. I set them at lvl 1 and never updated them, so I’m open to suggestions. I don’t (can’t) reach with one hand, but I have macros for my totems and if I need any others I’ll use my cursor or if I’m fighting NPCs I’ll just hit shift with my left and use my right hand to drop what I need at the moment. I use the macros 99% of the time unless I need earthbind, tremor or healing stream.
---
I play a ret pally. I only look at my meters between pulls bc I'm courious. I do need to get better at clearing Poly from the tank in ZF tho. I'm bad about that.
---
Why do you have SoC on your keybinds twice?
---
I was in a guild with people that were really patient and all of us were learning together.  By “seriously” I just mean we raided every single week.
---
Stick with Zandalar. You dont need to RP yourself and there are plenty that dont. The balance is fine too and you wont need to reroll :)
---
Bloodrazor proc is a DoT
---
As a feral Druid, phase 5 for AQ 20/40. Give me gear pliz
---
Nope just solo levelers trying to PvP like what happens now in lowbie zones and ofcourse some high level party on their way to the dungeon might get a kick out of killing you but that's normal.
---
I’ve run into quite a few horde 60’s that camp lowbies in Redridge/Duskwood, i assume in hopes of getting people to bring their mains and fight them.
---
Yeh every1 with their hs set to Kargath is only doing so to camp flight paths. It’s a fact
---
Tanks reserving orbs in strat living is scraping the barrel really.
---
Hey
---
Let me link you a special youtuber who delivers Paladin PvP guides in a University level lecture style.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Farb98h1KI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Farb98h1KI)
---
It's a thing, but a weird one. First parts and final part share no quests and are quite a bit apart in level range. 
---
Would recommend to make a full purple/orange side run for most quests, and princess slaying a second group. 
---
That being said, full quest runs are a thing, but quite long due to run backs
---
I had a razr. Yea I was one of those kids lol.
---
Anyone got a screenshot how it looks in the default frames?
---
Ok for about 3 people on a server it will help. Other than that it won't be much of a difference. There will be more people doing battlegrounds and harder to stay near the top.
---
dont swap, you dont need to engage in RP if you dont want to
---
This was posted last week and people defended it saying it was ‘no big deal’ this sub is a lost cause.
---
Quality content! Well done🤓
---
This isn't my experience and it's more to do with servers imbalance. Some servers are close to balanced and there has been very little change for questing lvl 48 to 59 on those servers.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
You can't queue for BGs outside the city.
---
And If the tank is geared AF and don't need any loot in there?
---
20 hours per week should be more than enough to kill kt.
---
Naxx wont be nearly as hard this time around. 
---
With melees knowing how to gear and servers that doesnt have 300ms the dps will be a breeze.
---
Some of the questions are actually not relevant to my project, i only need 4 of them, but thought it would be interessting to see what people respond. The reason for higher than 4 was twofold. For one, i was unsure how high it was actually possible to reach so far, but also because it would be interesting to see if people would lie.
---
Npcs don't like moving objects. They won't get on zeppelin, boats, or lifts.
---
Gold = Upgrades
---
Lol. As if horde no lifers have a girlfriend.
---
It does, they specifically re-enabled it for classic.
---
I have done about 30 lasher runs on my priest. And If I don’t have 55 mage water I have to spend 1 minute drinking between each pack. So I spend About 8 minutes just drinking doing a run. Do you have any tips on how to avoid this or improve?
---
yes it can be traded, within the 2h period. 
---
I made an error when bidding for the 2h mace, but wasnt enh spec on my shammy, so traded it back to the ML, for it to be DE'd, back in Org, without any issue. 
---
You'd need the other rogue to trade it with you.
---
What level can a mage start doing spellcleave runs in SM?
---
&gt;two pvp geared 60s ganking low to mid 50s?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;am I missing something or are these guys skilled and outplaying everyone?
---
yes you are clearly are blind?
---
1. Two pvp geared 60? the hunter doesnt even have his epic bow/wep he has 1 piece of giant stalker and its the boots, rest blues for raiding. hes super geared for a "non" geared warrior to hit him and do 50% of his life pool, im guessing you missed that part too?
---
2. Ganking low to mid 50s? im guessing you missed the 3 other 60s that had more than few epics as you see rogue and lock both have T2 helms...
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Awesome man!
---
I've lost a Dal Rend to a hunter :/
---
I guess they lie then because literally this weekend I had some random gnome warlock accidentally right click me in the Booty Bay tavern and a guard came and kicked his ass.
---
My current reputation on that character: https://i.imgur.com/CF3Nwiq.png
---
I'll bring this up next week!
---
PvP in WoW was never good, try tried everything, released arena small scale fights, the made it burst heavy where the fight was pretty much over within the first 15 seconds, they made it super slow and stalling increasing hp, reducing dmg and making healers super powerful so battles took 15min+, they made it super CC heavy where you ended up in 1min or more of a cc chain where you couldnt do anything but just watch the screen.
---
I agree 100% PvP in WoW is poorly designed at all levels, expansions and times.
---
Yes you have to play strategic unless as you said you just zerg through it with 100+ people, but if you play with only one 40 man raid in that area you need to know where to spread, how to ambush the enemy and kill their healers first, how to get up on a mountain so that rogues have a harder time just stealthing up towards you, when you call the push in discord and your melees charging in with sappers and try to kill a bulk, when you rotate granates and explosives to stun enemy ranged, when to fall back and where to regroup, where is the next bottleneck you can put down huntertraps and regen the raids mana, whats the plan if the enemy reinforcements closing in from the back...
---
Plenty of strategic choices, no its not about the biggest number if you have a good 40 man raid you will outlast 80 casual people who just zerg and dont know what to do (or 80 people who dont have ingi and wont use any bombs or sappers at all, our guild spent well over 50000 gold for preperation).
---
&gt; yes for hardcore and semi-hardcore player, I believe it's mostly fun: you have more friends, you are on top of the food chain, you'll never be the one feeling totally helpless
---
Yes we play since vanilla, we are a core of over 100 people which was growing currently, we have 3 active 40man raids farming for loot every single ID, our MT has thunderfury already at a state where we are waiting for BWL to drop to finish it, we played on private servers and cleared everything including naxx many times, we know how to play together and we have very good players of all classes in our groups.
---
Yes we wont just run into a group of horde and let them farm us for free, we will let them have a good fight, yes we often have someone of us feeling totally helpless cause he or she was just farmed somewhere and some rogues or people camped them, they text us on discord, we log on and we help them and crush the opponents.
---
Its absolutely fun for us and its absolutely what people advertised wpvp to be. Yes it sometimes is laggy and unplayable and yes sometimes running into 100 of the opposing faction will just end up being a big zerg, but you cant say its not fun or strategic if you dont play world pvp in a 40 man raid working together.
---
Thats like me saying "Or BWL sucks I went in alone and got oneshotted by the boss, this sucks so much why would anyone play PVE?", ofc for 40man raids you are also supposed to play in a group, and for world pvp you are supposed to play like that as well, if you do it alone its not fun for you.
---
And yes those lonely players are fodders for our enjoyment but again its their fault, PVE servers exist where they can decide if they want to be part of pvp or not however people choose to play on a pvp server, and all those crying morons who try to get a argument for it "But this is my first time playing mimimi", 15 years ago I didnt knew shit about the game, still I googled "what means pvp or pve?" before making my first character and it didnt took me more than 5min to find out that pvp means player vs player and that they suggest if I am a noob and new to the game I should start on pve.
---
Its a selfmade problem, you went to the BBQ and didnt check what BBQ means and now you are here and expect BBQ to be about eating pie and cake because you dislike eating meat, ofc people start making fun of you if you think that everyone is putting away their meat just for the special snowflake who didnt bother checking beforehand.
---
Its 2019, you are connected to the WWW 24/7 if people arent able to do that, I am sorry but they deserve to be fodder.
---
Natural selection.
---
People have been doing this between servers since the big bang.  So go ahead.
---
The other problem there is that my toon is alliance on ZT, but I want to play a horde character on my own
---
 U r welcome 👍🏻
---
I like to go in as dps for my first time through stuff. I'll throw on some crit leathers and do about mid level dps. Dps is much easier than tanking, and gives me time to learn about the dungeon.
---
they are great for folk leveling alts and leveling cooking. Fish are easily the fastest way to level cooking.
---
Just hop on YouTube and type in Priest Warrior DM Jump run :) you are welcome
---
VuhDo is deffinately my favorite, as it has so much configuration! :-)
---
It's safe to say at this point that people are exaggerating/embellishing situations here.
---
ONE incident happens and suddenly "THIS ISSUE MUST BE ADDRESSED" - players here are like the "I want to speak to a manager" moms.
---
The same with ganking/camping. Like yeah, it happens, but it's not the game ruining experience everyone cries about here.
---
Largely, yes, people here are full of shit.
---
Because there's too many people on most servers. Classic was not as populated as it is now. World PvP and imbalances would be felt far less if there was half the people in the world.
---
Agreed!
---
you clearly dont know how probability works.
---
Yeah I know objectivity is hard for zoomers to process.
---
WHO GAVE THIS CHILD A THESAURUS HUH? SPEAK UP YOU GOD DAMN COWARDS.

---
I'd just keep running instances and raids (if you can), for BiS. PvE gear was always more powerful than most PvP gear, and easier to access than PvPing.

Shaman cant use swords
---
10/10 MC in trade chat for recruiting looks a lot better than 9/10 ;)
---
In P1/P3 the knockback ability (Wing Buffet?) On tank drops aggro by about 33%, but it isn't a 'reset'.  If you reset meter at the start of P3, the meter should be accurate.  
---
If you don't reset the meter, P2 with flying/fireballs will make your meter inaccurate.
---
He's there to pickpocket everyday then ambush to test your crit damage.
---
&gt; Horde flair. Not surprised. 
---
Actually, I haven't touched an enemy player in a neutral town ever since Vanilla. Not sure what you're on about there.
---
&gt; Hate to tell you, but guards in everlook didn't give a damn when 5 hordes started attacking me, even tho I was friendly with them.
---
So you're saying the goblin guards are Horde favoured? Or what?
---
They still have phone support?
---
We played on private servers, with the same if not greater numbers and it worked way better than blizzard's servers.
---
You'll get no XP.
---
More like 10
---
Yeah but wpl is like 5 min fom undercity, why not gank there while in que
---
Same thing happening on EU Mograine in Thorium point. Same 4-5 horde monkeys have been camping there since yesterday. Logged on today early (day off from work) and they're still there. Standing at the exact same spot. I've reported them several times but I wouldn't imagine Blizzard actually caring about these griefers.
---
Not really how it works. If everyone can use it, everyone should greed, same with mats for profs from dungeons. If you’re the guy who rolls need, you’re the problem
---
Care to enlighten me, o Salty One?
---
You can see the spike, but no head. Org was so overcrowded it lagged like mad, we after popping the head we waited 20 minutes for it to show up but there was no head. The head showed up after couple of minutes as well as the buff
---

---
Kinda how I feel like when using the Death Ray midfight, when we're both below full hp. The ultimate decider, because at this point one thing is certain, someone is going to die within the next 4 seconds.
---
Sometimes it's them, sometimes it's me.
---
Big brain horde.
---
I've only ever seen the GBS drop in Winterspring. 
---
Grats! RNGzus is never so kind to me. I've been playing these games for over 20 years and I have always had terrible luck with rolls.
---
Sounds like your salty.
---
To companies everypenny matters. If you want an example, take Logitech gaming mice, their $150 wireless g pro is plagued by double clicking issue, the reason? To save 1/10 of a cent per mouse they went with cheap switches and ran them out of spec. It doesn't matter how small a price is, companies will try to shave off the costs.
---
How much spell power does a warlock need to farm Mara? What about DM?
---
I can literally see the tiny gears in your head moving yet somehow I’m still waiting for a counter argument 5 replies later. Lost cause?
---
They also have a larger hitbox and bigger dead zone if you're a hunter but you can use this to your advantage by keeping deviate delights and using a costume, then you can remove the costume when you tmneed the extra melee range.
---
Both has shown to be very inaccurate. The only half reliable source we have is data taken from Warcraftlogs, meaning guilds that log.
---
Not at all. You won't be doing 1st place in damage but put on some crit chance gear, beat on things in zerker stance, and dps will be usable.
---
All very good suggestions. I use these aswell. WIM moves classic in to the year 3019. It's truly a 300 IQ addon.
---
How is it bis? Those comparisons give dragonscale a very slight advantage when you compare it item to item, yes. 
---
We ignore here, that you need to spend 100g+ to enchant a really crappy pair of leggings and then do the same on some other blue piece, just to get ~10 AP worth of stats.
---
We also ignore, that using dragonscale makes using devilsaur impossible. Devilsaur is a superior set, because the individual items aren't trash by themselves (gauntlets are +4AP, -5 Agi vs Gargoyle slashers, leggings are +10AP, -9 agi vs Eldritch, dragonscale legs are +8 AP, -1% crit vs devilsaur). You can replace one piece, without necessarily having to replace the other. If we expand the comparison to include gauntlets + bracers/ring (because you need another hit % with using dragonscale), it looks even worse for dragonscale. 
---
E.g. in the first variant: 
---
* Gargoyle slashers are 24 AP and 5 Agi vs 28 AP from devilsaur, so -4 AP and +5 Agi. Sadist bracers have 6 Str (14AP over battleborn). Now we look at a total advantage of 27 AP (11 Str) and 23 Agi vs 31 Spelldmg, which is 40 equivalency points vs 40. So, it's even and I don't have to spend a libram of voracity on dragonscale leggings and eldritch legplates.
---
* Next option Blackstone Ring(20AP) vs Magni's will (6 Str (=14 AP)), 1% crit. 51 AP  (=21 Str) for the dragonscale composition vs 31 Spelldmg.  Easy victory here, that's almost 10 equivalency points worse, 31 Spelldmg is much better than 21 Str.
---
* Finally Blackstone ring vs Songstone(18 Spelldmg). 65 AP (=27 Str) and 1 % crit vs 49 Spelldmg. 59 Points for Dragonscale, 61 for the devilsaur composition.
---
Just because dragonscale has a slight advantage when comparing items directly, you have to look at the whole composition you need to use to make hitcap. In that case dragonscale at best reaches equivalency with a composition revolving around the devilsaur set and replacing devilsaur is much easier than replacing dragonscale, because the devilsaur pieces are good in their own right, while a single piece of dragonscale is trash.
---
You either go for a gear composition which uses neither set or you use devilsaur. Dragonscale is always the worst choice.
---
It's also easy to see how bad dragonscale is, when you look at it side by side with devilsaur. Devilsaur is 74 AP, 2% crit and 2% hit with two pieces. Dragonscale is 122 AP, 1% hit and 2% crit with three pieces. You get 48 AP, lose 1% hit and spend an extra item slot on it to boot. The only reason why dragonscale can even keep up, is that the shoulder and boots options at the moment aren't very good, but once you reach pvp rank 7 or get a single drop from bwl this changes.
---
Grrccatt
---
No the warlock was probably shit and I can tell you're a shit player too.
---
Without the silence on fan of knifes.
---
This is why I've always found arms slow and boring. It's fine in PVP where half your time is spent waiting to get your target within reach to pop off a big swing, but this is a big reason why arms is trash in pve later on compared to Fury, if things stay alive more than about 2 seconds, you're sat waiting to get the rage to do anything, whereas Fury gets rage from their offhand swings to sustain actually using abilities to do something other than standing rocking awkwardly next to the boss.
---
Alright, thanks alot!
---
Ony you can tank in normal gear. Even as fury i have no problem. For geddon and rag you want fire ress but you also need hit. If you cant reach fire ress cap(shouldnt be hard) stick a 2nd tank on rag and make him taunt instanly when u are yeeted miles away and you intercept and taunt back. If you resist the knockback you taunt melee will thank you for it.
---
As someone who hadn't played in years and forgot most dungeon layouts, I always prefaced my runs with that. 
---
No shame in admitting you aren't big brain
---
Also get DBM it gives warning and makes sounds during boss fights to alert u to mechanics. Real mob health shows hp and extended character stats to see details on ur stay page
---
You clearly have never played on a PvE realm. There's plenty of world PvP for those that go looking for it. The key difference is: you only have to go up against others if you want to.
---
Like i dont want to agrue the fact and the most profit has already been made. But i would not be suprised if it continued to climb in value slowly. If you have a want for it or enough disposable that it is insignificant to you then i do not see an issue spending that much money on a collectable or hobby item. Even if it is to use.
---
I get it 6k is a tonne of money. But a steady income with saving you can save up that money in a relatively short amount of time. If it is something that you want.
---
Tell you what we have a boomkin and I'd never trade him for something else
---
I really don't know what is more sick, the OP complaining he cant gang-bang as others are constantly gangbanging and not letting him in, or the people that got the idea how to not let others gangbang with them.
---
If this is not a clear sign that PvP classic servers will fail then I don't know what it is...
---
They battle 1on1 and the outcome is random. I've got Grunty and a friend of mine's got the zergling. Same goes for grunty vs. the baneling pet from the Heart of the Swarm CE
---
Whenever your battle grounds is done, no matter where you were you will be teleported back to the place where the party leader queues up, so you will have to keep making the journey out after each bg
---
Believe it or not I'm actually tanking - this is in BRD
---
I'm a warlock lvl 22
---
Fishing quite a bit at the moment and end up with a lot of bolts of wool. Is there anything I can craft with those that pulls a profit? They don't sell that well on their own. I could just vendor them but that feels like such a waste...
---
Not if you put it to last 30 days then it's 70/30 alliance favoured https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=30&amp;realm=4476_Gehennas
---
They are mostly mechanical fights, no huge damage is really required
---
Im confused as to what you hope to achieve? Do you want blizzard to change the rules so players higher level than you get banned for PvP'ing on a pvp server?
---
no
---
get a sword of zeal
---
Because?
---
This response is just cringe. What did he say that set you off? You look like a dumbass.
---
Plot twists, he wasn’t healing...
---
As people said already, invisibility and stealth are separate. Examples of INVISIBLE mobs that are detectable are the ghosts in Dire Maul West, the Unseen in Raven Hill and the Eyes of Naxxramas in Stratholme.
---
I'm personally sceptical that Retail WoW is actually so much harder than Vanilla WoW was. Vanilla WoW is easy because the mechanics have been dissected and ran through millions of times. Every trick, shortcut, optimisation, and improvement possible has already been wrung out and the fights as they were undertaken originally were done without many modern addons or optimisations that are essentials today.
---
I do think modern Retail bosses are more mechanically complex, but I also think current Classic bosses are so trivial because their strats are hyper-optimised and players are hitting them with modern technology rather than 2004/5-era technology.
---
In 15 years if people are playing Classic Battle for Azeroth I think the current serious business bosses will also be viewed as trivial encounters.
---
I know that whenever I leave org I get ganked lol
---
Wait.. u got to 32 and burned out? Game might not be the right choice for ya mate
---
Do you think that Blizzard pulled programmers from their work to write a cookbook?
---
I actually started this (by mistake) by lining up my 4 alts (multibox) and went for a shit, came back to ~200 lined up around me!
---
Alliance takes over towns and hordes have deathsquads. Gadgetzan and feralas bridge are constantly camped by alliance.
---
&gt; Thrall's tale:&lt;div class=""quote""&gt; 
---
Smart orc.
---
Hah.  Most warlocks should have a good grasp of what to do in there.
---
Basics.   Kill the big trees patrolling the first room (6 or 7 of them) as they will pull when you kill the tree boss.   Kill the elementals in the circle in the middle there.
---
Go upstairs (to the right) from tree boss.   2 elemental circles are up top.  Clear both.  Hunter boss patrols after second circle.
---
Drop down and go past tree boss through passageway.   Kill the patrolling elemental groups (saves wiping).  1 in front and 1 to the left.  Clear elemental circle on the left.  Go back the way you came (to right of door) and clear 1 patrolling elemental pack.  You will pass a second passageway here, ignore for now.  Clear elemental circle.   This should now open up the centre area for Immolthar.   There is no need to kill the individual elementals patrolling round this boss room at all.  kill boss.   Go back to second passageway you found and open door.  Drop down and turn around.  Kill Prince.
---
A warlock (for banish) and a priest (for shackle undead) will give you a MUCH easier time in here generally.  None of the boss fights are particularly hard (Prince hits like a truck though), its all about the trash.
---
Dont be put off by one bad run with a shitty group.   DM is a pretty fun place to go and the loot available is pretty good for all classes so finding groups shouldnt be too hard.  Just ask for someone who has a vague idea of what to do. :)
---
Yeah I think a ban is in order
---
Nice work! I hat programs do you use?
---
Playing alliance on earthshaker, so I can tell you abit the situation. My guild moved the first day the server has opened, which was back in september.
---
Its certainly not a one sided horde gankfest, but there are just more pvp enthusiastic horde players on the server than alliance, similar to every other pvp server. Alliance is holding up quite well though, we often take back thorium point and clear out the campers at morgans vigil / menethil / DM regularly though. Yesterday we took controle over BRM and wiped ~10 horde raids in the process with 15 of us, so that was quite succesfull.
---
I'd recommend transfering here, there is no login queue and the server is listed as High regularly now, so the population is there.
---
This is not happening on Mograine. Most alliance sits in Ironforge while horde roams in ganking parties around the world.
---
Every time you get an upgrade your stat weights will change slightly. So at some point the reverse may be true
---
Ya this doesn't make any sense because mages are one of the most altruistic classes in the game. They make free food and water and give ports. They buff which is hugely useful. Warriors on the other hand are entitled assholes.
---
**RAIDING CONSUMABLES:** Before 6pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
---
**ENCHANTING MATERIALS:** After 8pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
---
It is from the Auctionator addon package.
---
I have nothing but bad experiences with Hunters, most of the ones I come across on my server live up to the stereotype of the "huntard". I play rogue and I have had mixed experiences with other rogues. Warrs again have been mixed. Priests/Druids seem to be the nicest ive come across but obviously this is just based on what I have experiences everyone has a different view.
---
I would agree about rogues and warriors even though melee classes are my favorite.  Definitely have seen warriors break guilds apart over stupid shit that could've been fixed with the slightest bit of reason.  Also have seen lots of backstabbing and drama among rogues, no pun intended.
---
Every uninformed Orc tank in full defense gear with Quel'Serrar. Like, grats, you took away the Ony head from your melee and yourself because some website said that this is how you gear, or because " back in my day" that's how it was done.
---
Whenever I see those I just get sad for that person's guild.
---
That was my question.
---
The most toxic players I've encountered so far are probably rogues and warriors. The most humble have been druids. The most leeerooyy have been hunters and mages. Warlocks, paladins and priests I'm indifferent.
---
I’m someone with very little time to play. I’m very low level (30s). Needless ganking, camping or even forcing off of boats wastes a lot of my little time. 
---
The things that I find really harmless are the things that waste a few seconds. Incapacitate for a few seconds, wave and move on.  A fear here, a sheep there. The surprise sap. 
---
All have me slamming the desk in annoyance as I expect the kill to follow, but when the person is good enough to just have their fun and move along I end up leaving the encounters pleasantly surprised and my game experience is enriched.
---
Appreciate it. Just hit 60 a few hours ago, only have 160 + shadow dmg. Wasn't sure if it'd be enough as I haven't tried yet .
---
I spent 4 hours in BRD (arena farming) telling bear jokes and puns to the Druid tank. Im sure he was annoyed
---
The people who parrot "no changes" are clueless. The server size alone is a massive change to how the game is played.
---
An alternative
---
I would recommend 375 sp for the last boss in dme, cause then the imps die in one siphon life (if you are sm/DS spec)
---
It most certainly does not work.
---
\&gt; Smart people don't fly to TP or Burning Steppes when they want to go to BRM. 
---
It's as if you haven't played since P2 release.
---
Run to mailbox - send it to an alt, and come back for the second
---
Yes you can. Did it a few weeks ago with a fellow offtank.
---
Not just herox. Blameux too
---
I just check to see if I'm performing as I should. As a hunter when the tank pulls, I send in my pet after a second or so, knowing he will never pull agro (MM hunter and growl off of course so my pet does pitiful dmg) anyway. Then I wait a few secs and start autoshooting.  I never pull agro. Last time I checked heal meter and I noticed my 'healing taken'  was 7 times as low as the other dps-ers, while total dmg done in the instance was about the same.
---
I agree with you. Even if you’re a good tank who knows how to hold aggro and is aware of the mechanics of tanking, it’s tough entering a new dungeon. 
---
People forget that a large part of tanking is positioning. Knowing how to pull the mobs, which walls to use to LOS, which mobs to prioritise and which to cc. You can read a guide for the boss fights sure, but mishandling trash often leads to more wipes than boss mishaps. 
---
Every time you have a first run in a new dungeon, tell the group that you’ve never been there so you will go slower and be more cautious. If they have an issue with that, either leave or the person that has the issue can leave. It will save everyone so much hassle. People are usually accommodating and supportive. They’ll offer tips. Encourage more communication in your party chat. 
---
Eventually you’ll learn what trash you can skip, what you have to pull and where, what to cc and what to burn down. If everyone works together, you can have a great run.
---
imagine bringing loot drama to the watercooler at work.
---
I dunno man, sounds like a bad idea.
---
That's a meme about Valve though, I don't think activision blizzard ever claimed to be small.
---
Yes I believe it does
---
TIL it takes around 50 minutes to run from Orgrimmar to Silithus
---
You're right, but it's like 4xp because you're in a 40m raid group.
---
I had a group of 50-51 and it took use 1h20min. We did orange then wrap back to purple side for quest item. We kill all the boss from part 2
---
Imagine typing that sentence and being happy with your self right before you hit send. Yikes
---
As a priest I don't even bother with that, I just evade boss on the small ledge near the tunnel and invis pot in. Imo the time it takes to finish the boss isn't worth the couple items he drops - once he reaches 20% he becomes super slow and is always at the furthest point of the kite route so I can't even get to it without imps/lashers reaching me first.
---
Looks like it's within the game mechanics tho. I wonder what's Blizz going to do if they wanna fix this, they can't just turn a switch off.
---
Actually i just assumed for shaman and pally but 3 pièces bds is insance for warrior
---
I don't believe him. He says a lot of things.
---
Only way to beat a decent mage in a 1v1 is to outplay them. You have to bait them to use their Ice Blocks early, and you have to bait them to use their blink when you have either intercept off cd, or a grenade ready.
---
If he polymorphs you, as soon as that frostbolt/fireball hits start running the opposite direction. Use a nade to try and reset the fight or force them into uncomfortable locations. You have to get creative. 
---
Or you can use a free action potion. Just remember to pummel the poly.
---
Tabing maul through 3 targets is ok but if you have more than 3 mobs you will mess up your aggro, especially if you have a rogue backstabbing the shit out of your main target. Targeting is important, and dps following the targeting is even more important.
---
Alternate maul on your 2 primary targets and swipping in between is the way to go you will never lose aggro if the dps follows your lead. If you lose a mob dont bother much, taunt it or charge it.
---

---
Yes, the factions are not in open war with one another. However, our characters aren't soldiers either. We're simple adventurers and we kill other adventurers. Sometimes we do it...just because.
---
I mean, our characters aren't nice people. They have quite a propensity towards violence due to the nature of questing alone. They're hard people, and not very patient, so it makes sense that we kill members of the opposite faction whenever we find it prudent to do so.
---
Yeah but they were playable as the scourge, not as the forsaken. I see your point where it was continuity of wc3, but I agree with op - not entirely a fan of the forsaken.
---
Yes you definitely should enchant it.
---
Probably one of the best dungeon 2H for pve, but you'll change it as soon as you get an obsidian blade or a bonereaver. Definetly worth a try
---
Considering his insecure answer, I guess he did.
---
If you're slamming your desk as a level 30, reroll to a pve server. It gets way, way worse when you're higher level.
---
Druids are the chillest, warlocks are the most selfish, warriors are often good guys but little dumb, mages are most economicly oriented ppl and we rogues .... well we like to backstab from time to time
---
Wow, that was fast! I would love to do the same
---
Yes for community!
---
Krol Blade + Mirahs Song is a bit worse than Dal'rend set
---
Dal'Rend has +0.5dps on MH, +1.4dps on OH, 4 Str, 1% crit and 50 AP. 
---
Krol + Mirah has 16 Str, 9 Agi and 1% crit.
---
So in total, you gain 0.45% crit, but lose 26 AP (24 on alliance) and the base dps on the Dal'Rend set.
---
I wipe maybe 2/10 times as a lock, and if I do I just ress with soulstone and go for the nodes (remaining imps can be killed fast by fel dom summoning void, sacrificing and hellfire). But I only wipe if I'm unlucky with a double dot before imps spawns, drain life on the imps makes you unkillable
---
Unless you want to do the big zerg raids, sapper chargers are overkill.
---
Not very practical for small group or 1on1
---
As stated, invisibility and stealth arent same mechanic.
---
&gt; or I'm just fetching and drawing links?? 
---
Have you done the test on multiple realms, other regions, and other factions ?  
---
yeah i didn't think so...... so yes, you are fetching and drawing links.
---
Wait this is an actual quote, not just pasta?
---
The most recent message I was is early 2020. Which points to Jan-Feb.
---
April seems unlikely.
---
You like having a dress on, considering half your characters are clothies.
---
But you also like to swing big axes, as 2 of your characters are warriors.
---
No it does not but it protects the warlock from hellfire damage and more importantly from spell knock back if he gets hit. Please always shield a warlock that uses hellfire.
---
The enriched mana biscuits from being friendly with argent dawn are better than 55 mage water.
---
I'm not entirely sure about warlock, but generally talents that increase shadow spell damage do not affect wands. For priests, Darkness (10% shadow spell damage) does not affect wands, but Shadowform does since it's a global shadow damage multiplier, and so does Shadow Weaving since it's a debuff on the target.
---
Its good for mages invis, in tbc.
---
Accurate, minus the dress part
---
The card is the easiest thing to replace, and I can sit in the middle of Stormwind When few hundred people are spamming Rain of fire, Blizzard, Tranquilty waiting for Ony Buff, and my FPS never drops...
---
How much more card do I need?
---
As for the Ram.  I do other things besides game  some of which are very memory intensive, 16 wasn't enough, 32 was the next step up.
---
That's great info I'm sure but not info that anyone here asked for. My answer was 100% correct and I answered the question fully. Not certain why you're rambling about fury war Crit cap and shit.
---
Fun fact- Papadosio is a fantastic band. Check em out
---
They sure don't drop totems every fight because it's pretty.
---
God damn reddit plays with some awful warlocks today. Been playing no life style since launch and have yet to see this elusive drain life dps rotation at end game
---
It's an original collector's addition perk. My dad has it! He played Vanilla right when it launched. I convinced him to come back to Classic and play with me and my brother...god damn his Panda/Diablo/Zergling! I'm so jealous!
---
Same i feel like race is a lot more of a roll. Undead? All dickheads :p
---
OK Guys, everybody stop Wpvp now !  
---
thanks, its all been solved now
---
Oh cool, didn't know that!
---
I know that shadow form and shadow weaving on a priest increases (shadow) wand damage.  
---
So I would definitely assume that yes, gear and warlock talents will affect wands
---
Not sure what server / faction you play on, but on my server there's always 4-5 mages standing outside the inn in Kargath trying to sell portals and mage water. I go to Kargath and pay a mage 1g for 120 level 55 mage water every time before you start. 1g to increase your farming speed 30-40% for 2 hours? No brainer. You definitely shouldn't be doing this farm without 55 water, can't offer any tips to avoid having to drink, if you're doing it right you're using most/all of your mana pool on every pull. Buy the water!
---
On Kromcrush, TP is de facto Horde territory. Honestly, it's frustrating that it doesn't have "gadgetzan-esque" neutral guards to keep the peace. Either side denying entrance to the other is pretty rough. I like in town scuffles, or danger, or having to sneak out, sure. Even the risk that cities COULD be taken over for a few hours, or blockaded during peak raid hours to fuck with the opposition, is great and makes the game dynamic. But getting blown up as you land EVERY time you land is a lot.
---
Get an army of private healers. 
---
You'll be a monster with them. 
---
You'll be free honor without.
---
"muh anecdotal evidence". Top tier farmers aren't abusing MC and thus it clearly isn't the only way to rank.
---
By couple of rogues?
---
I'm level 51 alliance, and I literally can't go anywhere to grind or do quests. My only option on gehennas right now is to spam BRD. There's always 5 horde to 1 alliance anywhere I go.
---
it was known.
---
if you can't dedicate the time to be 60 in p1, why the fuck do you roll pvp server?
---
Dude Lucifron has not been made easy by insane knowledge of the fight and shortcut. It’s easy because the boss has 2 spells and 2 adds. No matter how you look at it it’s easy
---
If I want to rename character for example Bob to Jack, can I really delete Bob, create a new Bob and then recover the deleted one with the taken name change prompt? Are there any delays or rules related to that?
---
I'm not sure. I guess some people who play warriors have accepted their fate as the ultimate tanks.
---
Same as priests and shamans/paladins that will most probably go resto.
---
Hunters and rogues can pretty much be whatever they want since they will dps anyways.
---
I've met some impatient players at times, but not enough of a dataset to come to any relevant conclusion.
---
My explanation is: these people are not children, since they are paying for their subscription.
---
I rolled a hunter to play casually and not have any stress upon myself (like tanks!)
---
I've also got a rogue since it seems to deal way more damage than the hunter (at least during the leveling phase). 
---
So imo the only thing that this says about me is that I'm not prepared to be too invested in the game and I should be easily replaceable.
---
You reported them for what exactly?
---
Naxx, and more specifically the 4 Horseman fight. Not sure why that is,  but that is what I'm looking forward to. Back in Vanilla, we got halfway in Naxx before BC, and I loved that fight.
---
No, a devilsaur composition is always better than dragonscale. It's not as restrictive, because the devilsaur pieces are decent on their own and gives you much more flexibility.
---
Radie 20 for Range  and.. go in...... go out.... for melee
---
Idk why anyone would downvote this. It's da true true.
---
He was asking? Instead of being an arse, you could just say "yes, you are"
---
Maybe you should spend a little time outside the game tho man — long sessions and grinding can’t be good for your mental health at all. This game isn’t going anywhere.
---
I told him to get better at the game. One cannot get better at the game until they acknowledge they suck at it first. We've all been there, however most players  like you and the poster I replied to will always be shit because as soon as people tell you that you suck you instantly become defensive.
---
My experience is mixed bag with 80% nice all classes except rogues and mage , they are 90% toxic.
---
GMs can be cancer. I had one back in wrath that absolutely hated my guts, I assume because I was the only teenager at the time, but because I was the top dps in the guild and had most people's support, he had to bite his tongue. Gave me shit literally anytime I talked, multiple times threatened to kick me, just all kinds of bullshit. Getting mind controlled on Deathwhisper and one shotting him with a kspree the night he got shadowmourne was probably the highlight of that expansion for me.
---
trinketmenu i believe
---
nope that doesnt work as far as i know.
---
to be fair I really dont know how it works exactly, but in vanilla / tbc that would not work, because  the moment you create your "new" Bob character, your old Bobs information will be overwritten with new Bobs information. Making it impossible to recreate a charcter whos name has already been recyled.  
---
 At least thats what a GM told me back in the days.  
---
Could be different by now.
---
you gotta be joking  , or literally unable to draw comparison by observing
---
Either you're trolling or have serious issues, either way boring and overdone post.
---
The price of Krol blade may go up as more gold comes into the economy. The price of the mount will always stay the same. Thus buying the BoE is more of an inflation hedge right now.
---
That’s the theory anyway. If you want the mount first buy the mount first!
---
I swear I would think this is basic fucking logic, I've even played warlock, but now I refuse to heal most locks LT. I'm a geared af healer, but if you can't LT when you have rejuv on you, you're not getting LT heals at all, you may just die cus I hate you. Sorry I had to rant that.
---
0.025% drop chance for each of the items individually
---
Has nothing to do with FPs. Priest MCs the target player and then just lets his buddy kill his pet for a full HK because the target player is not attackable for their own faction due to MC, but is attackable for his buddy because of the permanent state of duel. The same mechanic could be used anywhere else.
---
Bro use hellfire with a health stone on you and an imp for stam boost or void for shield. Your life will change forever.
---
There’s nothing clickbait about this title in the current sense of the definition. 
---
“You took the bait” is an expression to say you fell for it... to fall for something means you did something and expecting a different result.
---
Here he said he was going to do something in the video and did it. 
---
How are we taking the bait here? Which part of the title did we fall for?
---
Noted, thank you.
---
The things people will do for karma. Honestly pathetic you would steal thos and repost. 
---
0 class.
---
They also made it so cheating could be easier but hey ho, let's keep circle jerking.
---
Relatively balanced, they meant in relation to some other PvP servers, it's definitely not balanced
---
Anyone 2+ players that jump me while in my pve healing gear on my priest, then while im dying or dead proceed to trash talk or bm emote me.
---
If your going to blow up a pve healer just do it and move on, don't try flex because 9/10 they cant win in 1v2 situations because theyre built for  doing mc/ony speedruns lmao
---
I'd hold on to the staff until you get more spell damage items. If you don't have hypnotic blade you could try to get it from SM:lib while it still gives you XP, and then around 45 look to equip dreamweave/shadoweave crafted gear, that would be a good time to switch to more spell damage oriented setup.
---
And get a head start on alts. Can’t get ganked in the barrens babyyyyy!
---
I mean it’s just a question that’s been asked a million times and is easily googled. 
---
Didn’t mean to be mean though.
---
Yes, You have to do that to redo the quest. I have done it several times even.
---
Btw i got to use it once about a week ago, and HOLY SHIT the range on it is insane. I saw a hunter and was pursuing him when he suddenly dismounted and went invisible. I immediately dismounted and used the buff. I was able to see him even though he was about 15 yards away from me.
---
&gt; Being arms means you're too cheap to respec to fury basically
---
Pretty much this  =p
---
I'm 31/5/15 Arms/Prot.  So I can DPS or tank 5/10 man content just fine and PvP without respeccing.  I've offtanked Ony and MC as well.  Given that Arms DPS is already pretty subpar, I typically end up just wearing my prot gear with a 2-hander when I DPS raids, which makes it super easy to slap on a sword n board and pick mobs up when stuff goes sideways.  Actually just last night our tanks all died on Baron and I was able to salvage the fight by tanking his last ~30%.  It's a fun role to fill, though I recognize no serious raid would have me.
---
LOL
---
Even if you have rocket helm reflector spider belt fap the mage can still beat you by just sheeping you and resetting your only hope is that you one shot them with lucky crits and hoj sword spec procs.
---
How do I use this service?
---
Can I use mouse over macros on the grid Ui the same as the raid frames?
---
I think i'm gonna take that advice! Thanks all for the nice answers
---
5 deaths to turn in a quest and buy 3 stacks of Sunfruit.  
---
:(
---
It's not useless, it will catch people using invisibility pots.
---
I will try that next morning :)
---
Imagine playing on the streamer server, joining a raid with a streamer, acting surprised when the streamer does a streamer thing, then getting the streamer banned from his streaming team, and finally coming to reddit to complain about the streamer to other people who don't like streaming antics
---
that’s nuts! i spent a couple hours farming there too
---
No more slaughtering people over a rich thorium vein? What’s the point!
---
If I constantly heal you full every time you go low and bandage, just do the exact same thing but don't bandage. You don't have to waste the bandage and it costs very little in my mana.
---
Would have been this phase, but I got behind in leveling so I don't have as much gear as everyone now.
---
It can. Warriors gain 1 point of rage per time they get hit. If a mob isn't attacking them you can think of it as 1 rage per mob per second lost. That's quite a lot.
---
Starting a fight a warrior tank is gonna have maybe one whirlwind hit on most of the mobs. If you charge in and whirlwind with a 2h you will have done more damage and have way more hate regardless of not hitting the high threat attacks. So really it's just about being patient.
---
Disagree entirely but that’s your opinion of that word,‘I recommend you change it. 
---
What would you call a buzz feed or any news corp org that has a “you won’t believe it until you see it. This woman eats her husband and has no remorse over it” and it’s a story about how she takes a picture and makes it into edible cookies. What would you call that? By your definition, I assume not clickbait
---
There are MMO's that are designed to have large scale PVP in the 500+ range for sure, but WoW is not one of them.
---
The collusion with gold farmers has nothing to do with server infrastructure y'know.
---
Threads like this make me remember why I never do pug groups as a warlock.
---
Considering mage and warrior being the most played class I guess it’s also the most assholes. 
---
Also every noob and his mother flock to those 2 classes. Have you ever seen a Reddit post from a new player start with anything but “so I’m new to classic, and I have a mage/warrior”
---
&gt; "you left your door unlocked, so it's your own fault that you got robbed" 
---
But thats what the insurance company is gonna tell you. And with that kind of example, someone joined a pvp server by accident and never realized it every time he logged on, until months later when p2 released and now cries about it?  
---
oh yea, if you leave your door unlocked for months, it is without a single doubt your own fault that you got robbed, just like it is if u left it unlocked for just some hours.
---
Keep the "and less than 100% mana", because why would you want to be less health for no reason?
---
More horde than alliance, but the Alliance put up more of a fight. The Alliance control BRM most of the time, horde pretty much piles up outside of the mountain while the Alliance gets kills, then Horde finally pushes in and overwhelms them and continues into their instances and the Alliance goes back to killing. Whole area around Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge, and Badlands is full of that happening as the Horde don't really care
---
Do you realize that escape artist can remove 10 second roots? The fact that you use it to remove crippling poison with a rogue right next to you (or frost bolt slow rather than a full nova) just proves that you're bad (again no offense). Gnome racial remains the best one in the game by far to players who know how to use it.
---
In our raid is a rogue with 30/0/21 and he Deals good dmg.you just need a bit more hit on gear because youre missing tue 5% hit from the combat tree
---
That seems too difficult to pull off because by the time duel starts and MC is cast, the target would probably die anyway. And besides, with rogues popping out of nowhere and ambushing your targets to steal half the honor all the time, it wouldn't contribute that much to the mess that is wpvp.
---
How do you mana tap correctly? Any tipps?
---
Basically just every class in one with free cleanses every time you shapeshift.
---
&gt;Ya this doesn't make any sense because mages are one of the most altruistic classes in the game. They make free food and water and give ports. They buff which is hugely useful. Warriors on the other hand are entitled assholes.
---
Altruistic? Yeah right...
---
They are one of the best farming classes in the game. They are self sufficient with water/food. They can move around the easily with portals. They have a great movement skill in blink. If that wasn't enough for one of the best classes for making money.
---
* they also get at least 1g for making a portal (for 20s reagent and almost no effort or less if more people need the portal) 
---
* AND they are charging for items they make out of thin air (mana). A few nights ago a player in my party was charged 2G for 60water and 40food. 
---
How in the world is this altruistic at all??
---
P.S. Of course there are exceptions. There's a 60 mage on Earthshaker EU that  ocasionally roams STV giving away food/water for free. I would like to mention him by name, but I don't remember it atm.
---
Yeah there weren't any cash shop or donation button.
---
I highly respect what they have done, but don't be a fool here.
---
Get auctionator, a lot simpler but with some nice features. It will tell you the vendor price and the auction price of all items, just got to scan the auction house and you are good to go. Also had a nice interface to buy things and a history tab to see how much an item has cost in the past. 
---
At 40 get the carrot addon, it equips your carrot on a sick and other mount gear when you get and mount on and swaps back when your done, its magic. this is also around the time you will want the Let me cast addon. 
---
Titan bars is great for xp/hr and knowing repair amount
---
You might need the item rack addon, if like me you want DPS gear but everyone wants you to tank. 
---
if your have a gathering profession (you should) you will want a gathering addon for later, you dont need to record where all the copper and peacebloom is but later you will want to record where the high end nodes are.
---
I'm at 160 mara kills on my hunter (just farming gold) and havent seen this thing yet. It's definitely rare.
---
I hit 60 with my warlock without ever picking up a profession, and i'm kinda kicking myself now. What professions would be good for me to pick up? Do warlocks have any tailoring BoPs down the road past tailoring? I was thing of doing herbalism / alchemy and making potions n stuff.
---
Unlucky bro.. they just don't stop !
---
And then you gotta run behind a tree to HS... And 1 sec before the end you hear the stun charge noise x 3 .. RIP
---
Doesnt care about pvp? Did they just roll on a pvp server because it makes leveling feel more dangerous and fun?
---
What’s the fastest 5 man dungeon to run at level 59? Looking to do quests and pick up gear.
---
&gt;Elitist gamer culture
---
Yes it is.
---
&gt;from 2004
---
lol wtf is wrong with you did you really think it went anywhere ?
---
Method didn't pay the dude a dime. The only thing he got in return for his contract was putting the Method tag in his stream title and maybe "connections". He has more viewers than ever now, barring ofc his peak when leveling. His career is literally flourishing thanks to drama spergs like you
---
You can't compare it to private servers when they offload calculations to clients  (Which is prone to cheating) so their servers don't crash.
---
When's the last time a mage did anything for free for you? Naw mages are easily the worst this time around and I'm so glad I didn't role mage which was my old main lol
---
fucking lol
---
Does it really upset you that people like to enjoy the game differently than you?
---
That's gonna be a yikers for me fam.
---
There's definitely a link between class and personality
---
No, the problem is they are entitled shits.
---
It is Blizzard's problem, I didn't say it wasn't. 
---
It's not a simple fix is my point.
---
(Full disclosure, i main a priest)  
---
\- Warrior tanks seem to be the most entitled. This might be based on some reason, given the fact they are the defacto tank and in high demand, but that is how i've found them. They are also often more experienced/knowledgable about the game, for much the same reason.
---
\- Rogues are wild-cards. Some of them do amazing dps and use the little utility they have, and some are batshit crazy.  
---
\- Shamans are usually a little less knowledgable about the game but often seem very jolly.
---
\- Hunters are often very quiet, and very rarely do super stupid shit or amazing stuff.
---
\- Warlocks are 50/50, they are either really considerate and help with soulstone, healthstone, pet &amp; life tap nice, and some of them are "OMG HEAL ME I NEED MORE MANA FOR MORE DAMAGE RN!"
---
\- Mages are often nice, always nice with their water and portals and buffs, and honestly haven't had too much "AoE, pull, pull, pull" as many people say, but they do seem to be more economically focussed.
---
\- Druids are no doubt the nicest most chill people and genuinly just nice to hang around
---
\- Priests i don't meet often (for obvious reasons) but they do seem to be nice enough. Willing to dispell in high-intensity encounters but there's always a bit of a rivalry about gear which sometimes creates tension.
---
Anyway, that's my experience, obviously it is biased and subjective, so don't hate me to death.
---
His diet is fresh gnomes only
---
All gnomes are kos, level doesn't matter lol
---
I post them up in trade for a little above vendor and a hunter always hits me up
---
Is this some sort of server- or alliance-specific problem? BoE's are liquid assets that are equally useful for each and every party member, and rolling need on them is a standard practice. I've seen several BoE epics drop since  classic release and I've never encountered this kind of drama. People need on valuable BoE's as they should and move on with their runs.
---
deep ret to rep, 3% hit in prot, and down to cons in holy! i raid ret and hate respec costs. i’ve tried farming in the traditional lasher farm spec, but i really prefer deep ret more. you need some decent gear but easy nonetheless. retri shield from abomination in strat ud, and 5/5 deathbone
---
I love how wolves attack critters now and then. Kind of wish it was a more generalized behaviour, so that it'd apply in scenarios like this as well.
---
Even 60 vs 60 can be a huge difference depending on how long they've been 60.
---
The only thing I complain about are locks who wont LT when they have a hot on them, and those who LT before a fight. If you do either of those, you are wrong, and any healer that tells you to do either of those are wrong.
---
"Nostalgia"... sometimes I am not sure what that means.
---
Wasn't any on Nost and they had an even bigger server than the full ones in classic.
---
yeah taking it from this side seems to explain the thing, the less your class need other classes to be effective, the more it will attract certain type of personalities
---
What for Addon for the Nameplates with debuffs, ty.
---
This. If you agree beforehand to all need on the lottery items (100g+ items or something), then you wont get fuckups.
---
It's more like a state of undeclared war, particularly once the Battlegrounds start being added. 
---
Warsong Gulch is a border skirmish because Horde lumber operations encroach too far into Ashenvale: the Horde aren't trying to attack the Night Elves, and the Night Elves are interested primarily in protecting the forests. Alterac Valley is a Dwarven expedition looking for relics and imposing on territory the Frostwolf Clan holds to be theirs: the Dwarves didn't come seeking to destroy the Frostwolves, and the Frostwolves are interested in maintaining their isolation.
---
Arathi Basin is perhaps the *closest* to being actual war operations, with the Forsaken seeking to profit from Stromgarde's collapse by seizing chunks of it's former territory, and the Alliance getting involved militarily to prop up the Stromgarde remnants. Both sides are involved for primarily military reasons.
---
yeah my alt! got my friend to invite my main and alt, and when you’re done with a round of lashers, log onto your alt and wait for it to pass lead, then reset
---
You know what they say about assumptions. This post is dumb shit, go ahead and delete.
---
I swear ive had them defend me too but idk, a lot of the time its like they dont care..
---
They're a absolutely not easier than retail lfr... On retail lfr you dont need to know anything about the boss fight or prepare at all. You either wipe until you have enough stacks of the buff to clear it or you requeue until you have a group that can do it.
---
You can't do it like he does in his example. But you can do
---
/target mana tide totem
---
/target windfury totem
---
/target tremor totem
---
/target grounding totem
---
This does not work in retail, and it did not work in early classic beta. They specifically enabled it in classic because #nochanges.
---
What a piece of absolute dogshit, using someone else's painful times for your own personal gain... for what? Karma? Really??
---
Threat plates :)
---
hey I have a short question about grid2:
---
Is there any way to display mana in the 40 man raid frames ?  
---
Im really struggling to find a decent solution. Anything I tried out myself just ended but messing with the entire grid.
---
This may sound stupid but right now im toggling the "hide" button of the original frames infight just to get a glimpse of the other healers mana... and its terrible.
---
These old school raids are a pretty good learning experience for people who haven't raided before.  A couple simple tasks for each boss fight makes it fairly straightforward.  Of course, the gear progression from week to week is also evident and emphasizes how important gear can be.
---
at 59 you should be looking at the BIS lists, and deciding what dungeon to run based on what item/items you want to get. Save as many quests as you can at this stage. you will get to 60 without them. Then at 60 you will get extra gold instead of XP which will come in handy.
---
I mostly run scholo/strat with pallies tanking and it's pretty decent even if its a meme.
---
Improved righteous + boS and u keep aggro !
---
Do you have reckoning 5/5 ?
---
Life stealing is what I gave my leveling warrior.  It heals for 30 and also deals 30 damage. But them again im playing ally on a pvp server,  so my weapon enchant should last me... 2 or 3 years.. as I work my way from 25 to 30.
---
You don't think that the twitch clip you linked isn't a prime example of a server lag?
---
Players are rubberbanding all over the place, spells are taking seconds to go off.
---
I think it's from the office?
---
Boogaloo
---
I doubt there has been enough time to run it 1100 times
---
It's so obnoxious of a responses, I you had read what he says, you will understand that it's not about defending blizzard, they have done many many errors and will continue to do so.
---
It doesn't change the fact that the comparing them doesn't make sense on the technical side since the context is widely different. I won't explain why here it have already been stated so many time here.
---
Plus the fact that your only argument is to call people "blizzard fanboy" is just proof you don't have any real argument about what you are saying.
---
It's possible for them to fix this, but it's no way near the same cost as it was for pservers.
---
UBRS is pretty short compared to other high lvl dungeons.
---
Warrior about to hit 58, realizing now I really need to start using macros and revamp my keymaps for end game tanking. Any guides/macros/ recommended add ons for tanking?
---
That doesn't seem right at all, it takes WAY too long to bandage, it has to be 100% more efficient to just actually heal them then drink. That's honestly crazy to bandage someone as a healer imo unless you were mana burned or something.
---
Just saw that you are a level 22 warlock- that's perfect for this one:  go to a major city's common area and start roleplaying in say or yell that you can't go on any longer and will be taking your own life.  The top of the bank in Orgrimmar is a good place for this if you are horde, or the bridge in Ironforge if you are Alliance.  After you've sufficiently roleplayed your 'man on the edge' routine, soulstone yourself, tap to near death and then dramatically jump to your death in a flourish.  Here's the good part- now that you're dead, you've suddenly had a change of heart and want to live.  Get somebody (anyone really, but preferably someone who was listening to your story) to resurrect you.  Right before they complete their cast, accept your soulstone, tell them that you fooled them and run away laughing at how gullible they are for believing you.
---
Yes but in some fights when mana gets a bit tight mana can become a scarce resource, its in these situations when I can see there mana is low so I tap and bandage to save them some mana and then they heal me making the fighter needlessly harder
---
What's the worst pvp server for the Alliance?
---
All he's saying is don't use "at war" as an excuse for wpvp. As the text says skirmishes and small battles do occur but they're not part of a war.
---
Go buy a Lotto ticket right now
---
It's definitely a stun, but it only lasts 1 second. It also indeed can't be used in combat, which will be a big issue for them with the abundance of Hunter twinks.
---
I had a 10 man ubrs group all pass skull flame shield to me as the tank that was pretty cool.

Take note warlocks, neither devour magic nor spell lock are on autocast.
---
True... I ended up dancong with a cute UD priest with with gnome yesterday, was pretty wolesome.
---
He put a little DOT on me when his pals arrived but you know
---
The annoying thing about mages is they never have to pay the price for their misdeeds. Nova - blink - blizzard and it looks like it all went as planned. Maybe it did, idk. Even though it's their fault, I still feel like shit as the tank whenever I see a giant ice cube in a run.
---
let me verify something before that plz, what class do you main?
---
What is this lower mental stratum shit, you have a friends list.
---
Yeah you only need to know 1 or 2 things for every fight. We had over half pugs on our first 10/10.
---
Stealth on the roofs at the bay in STV. Throw a distract when horde runs by and watch them run in the water
---
You need to provide us with more info. What is your class? Have you done any dungeons? What items are you looking to upgrade?
---
Fastest dungeon for quests and useful items can be different for everyone, depending on the abovementioned criteria. If it were me, I would have chosen a dungeon to do first and then worry about the time it takes.
---
Server balance - have an alliance toon on kromcrush and it feels like I am ungodly outnumbered. My whole life is dying. Anyone else feel like this?

It’s both!
---
There's bloodvine set in phase 4, which isn't BOP but the set bonus requires having 300 tailoring and is BIS for mages/warlocks.
---
Until then, robe of the void is only a little bit better than robe of winter night.
---
Then you didnt watch my video at all ,   I would kill for a lag   lol ,   we are facing 99 percent packetloss
---
its all swings and roundabouts!! I'd seen a fair few tanks who think they are elite as their are limited numbers. There will be bad players in every class. Players who are so opinionated and believe their time is more precious than others, and other players who believe they are entitled to loot before others. Thats just life really.
---
&gt;2 raids full of 60s
---
The majority of the olympus guilds are not even close to 60.
---
And yes, it did happen. He got corpse camped for 8 hours straight. Literally. I'm sure he tried to rally his troops during that time, but it didnt help.
---
Silly me me to ask probably, but what IS the lasher farm?
---
\&gt; Actually it's impossible for a lock to waste the healers mana. 
---
So you are just going to try and set some mental gymnastics up for why not life tapping a hot isn't wasting a healers mana? Because you just can't, you are 100% wrong, it's not an opinion it's a fact.
---
The wand doesn’t count as a 1 handed weapon (it’s in its own range slot). Usually the combo is the illusionary rod OR the orb + hypnotic blade (a 1 handed dagger that drops off same boss as the rod)
---
😂👍
---
Basically it's about decision making. If I see something more valuable than 48-54 lowbie, I go for more value. If there is nobody else around, I kill the lowbie (something is more than 0).    
---
Also I have pretty bad experience with letting lowbies live, because once you start a 1v1 with a 60 near some lowbie, the lowbie will most likely try to help their faction and you regret you didn't kill him earlier.    
---
You don't really need that much resource to kill some lowbie in leveling gear if you are decently geared by yourself. My experience is different to yours, I never regretted killing a lowbie. I only regretted letting him live, because it backfired on me :D
---
i cant comment on why people rolled on what server they did. the fact that there are 3x as many PVP servers as PVE servers prob has something to do with it. 
---
The people i started playing with rolled on a server we could actually log into in the first month. We gave little thought to what type it was we just wanted to play. and the initial leveling exp and time before honor mirrored our exp from vanilla. It didn't turn to shit until the allowed people to leave when the server was balanced and then turned on honor.
---
so yes I am someone on a PVP server who gives zero fucks about PVP. i would still give zero fucks if i was the dominant faction on the server. the PVP aspect of this and any game is the least important part of it to the point where it might as well not exist. 
---
Yes most of my guild does not care about PVP and raid logs and so do i. I don't think i have left IF since Thursday.
---
Funny how these things work. Hunters have been top performers in my groups, while mages were mostly shit, some dont even give out water to the group, and I have no fucking clue why
---
Is Krol Blade/Mirahs Song the best alternative to the Rend set?
---
no not at all, but Bliz has said if you get scammed its your own issue.
---
So The Burning Crusade with better balance.

That’s what I’ll be doing over thanksgiving, but tonight and tomorrow, my time is a bit more limited and it’s been 10 years since I ran these, so I’m looking for what I can relearn and run the quickest as i relearn endgame
---
Honestly if they don’t OVERUSE the shit out of if on a crazy hard fight I’m okay with it. Sometimes they die and they know it’s on them. If you can’t get to healing don’t. I love warlocks though, they’re always nice people lol
---
Your critiques speak to the system in general. Of course, this bug is an advantage in farming honor to anyone abuses it. You’re turning an unhonorable kill into 50 honor. That’s huge. Your argument is basically this, “the pvp system sucks, so it does matter”. You sound salty for par taking in the honor system.
---
I wish I had a tank that would run Scholo, on my server we have to pay tanks to do anything because there are hardly any who will do that instance.
---
Oh, jebus. Oh dear sweet baby jebus.
---
If you buff someone being attacked by guards, in Gadget for example, the guards aggro you. My dumbass found this out at level 50
---
You have no chance to beat a frost mage as a warrior without using any engineering gadgets. Iron Grenades are not expensive. Goblin Rocket Helmet will help you close the gap. Frost Reflector will stop a lot of incoming damage. Gnomish Net-o-matic will also help you close the gap after a blink. Same with Gnomish/Goblin Rocket Boots.
---
My lvl 50 mage alt is being corpse camped in gadget frequently.  Takes me 2-3 deaths just to get away from town.  They need to make those guards in neutral cities stronger, with stealth detection.  I'm all for PVP, but being camped in a city, that's such bullshit, IMO.
---
No it isn’t
---
Everything is so easy now it barely matters. Unless you are in a guild doing speedruns raiding in whatever spec is usually fine. Just ask the guild if they are fine with it.
---
You’re also missing improved backstab...
---
Well I was top 5 dps on onyxia last night and my gear is not that great. The damage does not really matter the only downside is if you can live with 20% less range on shadowbolt. Mc and onyxia are easy, but for later raids you will ofc have to respec for farm and raid
---
Found the virgin
---
I lucked out and got shadowfang/assassins blade two runs apart when farming for shadowfang
---
You can display the mana or resources in either full numbers or percentages but you can't have bars like you're used to but you can also set border flashes for mana % or whatever so you can see if someone is getting low. It takes a little getting used to but the screen real estate it just too good.
---
Do you bother going into the elite caves for minig?  I need a new mining route, Winterspring isn't working for me, recently.
---
Yes it works because there you target the totems yourself, which is not what he was asking for
---
Your mom.
---
I’m not even sure BGs are going to help, at least, not in the long term.  I think once casual pvp-ers realize that PUGs just get rolled as fodder for pre-mades in BGs, they will stop bothering to queue up.  And once premades start having to go against other premades, they will realize it’s more efficient to go back to rolling people in questing areas.
---
The gathering professions are going to be a pain. and you have lost the advantage of getting money as you level from them, so i would ignore them, unless you really want to farm high end mats. It would take a lot of farming to make leveling up worth it. Engineering is good for PVP and just kinda fun. Engineering is a profession you can get to 300 from the AH. It will cost around 400ish? (depends on your server) to level to 300. Alch is another one you could level from the AH
---
This is the only answer you need 
---
And buy stuff on saturdays. Always the cheapest prices
---
The hate this sub has for this guy is borderline obsessive lmao.
---
Warrior tank, running with a priest healer.  It’s been 10 years since I ran them, and I haven’t done anything past BRD in Classic.
---
BRD was a 3 hour grind fest, knew that going in.
---
Will Strath Live vs Dead, Scholo or LBRD be like that?
---
Two things:
---
1. Larger server populations
---
2. Nostalgia. You only remember the good and the truly bad
---
Mages. Ppl still think of a mage as just another party member. But a solo mage can often do larger pulls on their own than the average 5man group can.
---
I mean, Ive played on a pserver but never went to MC/Ony or any other vanilla raid. But hows MC or Ony considered hard? Rag is a simple tank n spank, with meeles having to run 5 yards out of range every 30secs to not get knockd back and casters simply having to stand apart from each other. Majo simply requires 5 people being able to tank, a dps warrior with a shield being enough, and 4 mages that sheep. Our raid was able to clear MC in 1 raid without anyone having any information besides from online guides. Ofc we had the advantage that most of us farmed preBIS but nonetheless MC is a joke if u look at the mechanics.
---
Yeah pretty much. Sword of Zeal is up there too. They're all pretty close
---
Thrash blade is pretty good too if you don't want to spend money on Krol.
---
Glad to hear bro, hope you hit 60 soon! If you ever need help, i got a free murder service, hmu under Netherwind
---
Seraph's Strike is even better.
---
They do bots in waves so it’s harder for the botters to figure out what got them banned
---
Yeah, the little +10s are shit. They are fun at first with things like TBC and WOTLK to a lesser extent, but eventually they just break the entire levelling process. IMO it would be better adding new starting zones and other areas that enrich the depth of the 1-60 experience, then give more incentive for 60 players to play around the world.
---
I went in there to quest yesterday to try to escape the constant ganking in Tanaris..... died 5 times in 30 minutes, NOPE.
---
**TL:DR** Not Really.
---
**Long version.**
---
As with all things WoW classic, your server may be completely different, however my experiance is...
---
If you look on any of the popular Leveling Cooking + Fishing guides e.g.  [https://www.elsanglinreborn.com/training/alliance-cooking](https://www.elsanglinreborn.com/training/alliance-cooking) 
---
Any fish mentioned has a chance to sell in Bulk. However, usually they rot on the AH.  
---
I would suggest you also sell the recipe for the fish(es) your selling, because... lazy people. And Announce availability in Trade, because lazy people will take advantage of the "free skill" oppurtunity, but aren't generally going out of their way to look for them.
---
Hunters with Cats, will feed them to their pet, however by the time you find a hunter that will pay above vendor price, you could have vendored them and fished up a few more valuable fish, for better profit.
---
Most of them aren't even worth cooking before you vendor them, some are even worth less cooked than raw.
---
You go into Dire Maul East and jump down to where the large packs of lashers are (the non-elite mobs) and AoE them down solo. They drop greys that sell for good money (e.g. Serrated Petal which sells for ~70s each) but not all classes can do it efficiently. Sorry Warriors!
---
So long as guards can hit you, (in a city), you're not going to get banned for attacking from an elevated platform.
---
You don't need tailoring or robe of the void. It is luxurious item, definitely not required as it not even that better  than the alternatives. Just pickup robe of the winter night or +40/41 shadow dmg robe (of shadow wrath) and you will be fine. Alch and herb is legit, you can go this way. Other option people like is eng and mining.
---
Is.. is that you, Sherlock holmes?! :O
---
there you go
---
Using Hunter's Mark on random far-away people and then running away. Bonus points if they don't actually see you and are now paranoid that a hunter is sending their pet at them.
---
=
---
When someone on your faction is low hp/mp in a PVP area (like STV) and stops to eat/drink, and you are rogue/druid*, walk up behind them very slowly in stealth to give them a heartattack as they get the "stealth noise" sound as  you fade in and think they're  moments away from dying to a rogue gank.
---
*also works with hunter cat (prowl) using eyes of the beast
---
Mailing weird items to random people. Always gets some interesting responses, usually confusion though. Example:
---
&gt; [Boar Intestines]
---
&gt; Subject: Boar Intestines
---
&gt; Text: "You know what to do"
---
Using eyes of the beast to assist enemy players grinding mobs. Or just assisting enemy lowbies grinding mobs in general. People think that they're about to die to you but then you end up helping them.
---
Idk about the other classes but you're 100% on to something with the mages. Growing up as a warlock in late august it was really hard to stay away from the temptation of reddit's most dreaded: sPeLl ClEaVe dungeon farms. I would imagine that was doubly for a class that was 4x more likely to be invited cause it was literally a braindead ass blast to 60. Take that and compound it with the fact that we have to pay these blue fuckers for buttons in their spellbook and you've got a recipe for an entitled cunt who blows dongs at the game
---
&gt; And why do they all still use shitty X/Z-Perl???
---
I've never known anything else, but I only use it for my player &amp; target frames, and grid for party / raid.
---
What do you use?
---
Mind control a shaman to place down a windfury totem for your group to make that 9 hits.
---
Also one thing I forgot is that JoL &amp; JoW afaik dont have the same proc limitations as those are debuffs on the enemy. It should be possible to heal up to \~400-500 in a single reck swing from all this hits with JoL up. Not 100% sure about this, but I've definitely seen multi-procs of JoW with a HoJ-proc.
---
Oh nice lol I dont know why that looked like shadow stalker for a sec lol
---
Yes, all mages need are more competition for a very rare drop from an already rare spawn.
---
In 5 man it's far from short and you probably wouldn't get in at 58, and in a raid group you get significantly cut XP.
---
My look on it is, if you’re a healer fucking heal. Don’t primarily focus the warlocks health. Give him a renew at the beginning at the end cast a quick flash heal you’re g2g
---
That's fair, everyone has their likes and dislikes of each race in game for whatever reason. I personally can't stand female dwarves, they're all KOS to me. Yuck
---
&gt; our critiques speak to the system in general. Of course, this bug is an advantage in farming honor to anyone abuses it. You’re turning an unhonorable kill into 50 honor. That’s huge.
---
No. I'm literally just saying his statement is absolutely wrong and no 50 honor point isn't huge lmao.
---
It really shows how big of a moron you're when you think 50 honor does anything. People farming for rank 14 earns around 200k honor a week in organized pvp and people farming a fucking flight point will never come even close.
---
Diminishing returns and no honor I think
---
A it's against the rules b you can only kill one character 10 times before they are worth 0 honor
---
This opening scene was so intense
---
I'm not sure what you're asking.  Are you trying to test retail mechanics using classic?  If so, there may be a few that you could test out, but gameplay is completely different including class basics.  What specifically are you trying to test?
---
It's bad but if you are good you will still beat bad players. You will do only 50%-70% of what you could do and even less on fights with cleave. (Which are most fights in MC)
---
Seems like a stretch.  If march then wouldn't that be even slower than the original EU timeline or would it still be a bit faster?  So far they have been going at least a few weeks early compared to vanilla.  My guess was late January or early feb which would still be 5+ months of MC only.

Those stats are incorrect. Its way more skewed towards horde than alliance. You can definetely feel the imbalance if you play on the server but its no where near Skeram levels of imbalanced.
---
Not that it would "fix" people FP camping, but I think the Honorless debuff should be the same category debuff as Forbearance or whatever the debuff you get for priest shielding is. The red debuffs that can't be removed.
---
But every single step those people do is legit and working as intended. You come to a result that you dont like it combined, but can you ban anyone for this? Like what is the abuse here.
---
Send them to hunters or alts of the appropriate level in your guild

I like to tap until I have equal health and mana and start eating+ drinking.

I use a guitar hero control instead of a mouse.  I've got all the buttons bound for various macros, and taunt is bound to the whammy bar.

Use it in Undercity. Also invis pots. Also it is buff protection from dispels.

Yes... you can compare it. And should. The cheating point you made though is valid, and important part of making comparisons.
---
Yep thats what it means mate. Youre locked

As a warlock, Banishing demons/elementals other people are fighting when they have less than 10% HP.

Hitting people for 5 damage with my dagger as soon as I see them bandage.
---
Can I tank it at 59 in a 5 man group? Or is it going to be somewhat gear dependent?
---
I'm getting burnt out trying to level my druid (51) and I started up a warrior alt that I'm having a blast with. Do you guys think I should finish leveling my druid first, or take a break and play my new warrior?
---
well, fuck :(
---
UBRS is pretty fast, compared to all of the other level 60 dungeons - however he's probably not going to be able to get into a group as a 59.
---
I don't have to, because there was no such statement, only an assumption.
---
Hey thats what they said at the panel at blizzcon, There has been speculation to extend out the timeframes to get more money as well.
---
The nicest players I met are definitely those below lvl 60, while the most toxic ones are generally members of top raiding guilds. 
---
I havent really seen any patterns on toxicity based on classes or roles.
---
Is this incendius? That’s my Guild!

You can break the fear in so many fears lmao. You suck much to think the fear is unbreakable XD. Will of the Forsaken my dude, do you what it does lmao.
---
Sorry no I meant, I haven’t played retail in ages. I’m getting a bit bored of classic and wanted to try out everything that’s new in retail but don’t want to make like 4 races and characters just to see all the zones - so I was wondering if there was a race/class combo (like night elf Druid or human death knight) that lets me see all the best new zones and also play a class that is fun/not 1 dimensional
---
Hey, fable is my guild
---
I don't know that we're cool enough to pull off Arms warriors tanking MC.
---
We're also running MC as two groups of 25, so we have less wiggle room than some.
---
Do whatever you think is the most fun, which sounds like the Warrior
---
Dude preach. The fact that we not only have to either ask for it in group or pay for it out of group is completely absurd. Its literally part of their fuckin spellbook and part of their obligation to the utility of the group. Come to the content prepared with multiple multiple stacks of water AND food and just start opening trades. Cause why the fuck wouldn't you? We all use the same resources. God damn I hate classic mages
---
You think you wanted Classic, but you didn't.
---
How much do ingots go for?
---
Or don't bullshit them and tell them what's up. If they're a good raid lead they'll understand.

Yet another "PVP is happening on PVP server" post...
---
As healer my group wipe 2 times in Maraudon. 
---
First one cause nobody tell me the Diemetradon have a silence os 8 fucking seconds.
---
Second cause this rock elementals stun, and they never use this on tanker, its always on casters in range
---
Since the beginning I told everybody I got all quests to do, and couldn't remember how Maraudon works
---
ps.: I know healers should heal from a far, but some melee players have the will to fight jumping and running around
---
Try /r/wow imo
---
You know that's what the thread is about, right? .. right?
---
Been lashed farming for the last week using this method and it always takes 2 mins on its own without converting to raid.
---
I mean it wouldn't surprise me if someone used that name for their character, but I was referencing your post  [https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rhabdomyolysis-symptoms-causes-treatments#1](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rhabdomyolysis-symptoms-causes-treatments#1)
---
I don't have to, because the guy I replied to didn't make the statement "classic has 5 million players", he made an assumption for the sake of the argument.
---
I wouldn't do it before 60 either way. Even Jed/Rend runs (basically doing half the dungeon) usually bring 6+ people, 5 is pretty extreme if not everyone is on point. And there isn't anything worthwhile in there for tanks until the last boss, which you won't be 5 manning for sure.
---
Find a place to grind mobs out of the way hidden and just grind mobs watching tv
---
It's extremely useful for spotting invisible ghosts in dm and undead strat, FYI all.
---
I highly doubt that’s something to get gkicked over.
---
1st orb? Yea ok
---
Every orb afterwards? Fuck off.
---
I need a vid of this
---
What's an "op shop"? Is that like a thrift store? I'm curious what is in this, can we see an example?
---
It wasn't a claim, it was an assumption for the sake of argument.
---
Interesting game plan on their part.  I guess as long as people don't feel it is too stale and quit due to that then it could work.  If they got the TBC/WOTLK route though they shouldn't have to worry too much about stretching things out for a few years.  Our guild is still pretty good with a decent number of people not just raid logging but another 3+ months of MC may change that.
---
Level  36 inferno cape world first classic wow when??
---
Top 10 Bruh moments
---
How does this even happen? 
---
I thought you had to actually attack/kill something before you get locked to a raid?
---
Ok, I only have a rock band drum set, do you think that would work?
---
Thanks, I was thinking I’d avoid that one until I ran the other ones first
---
You should've seen it, somehow it moved me behind the wall of npc that teleports to MC.
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!? *Insert gladiator meme here*
---
What server is alliance dominated? Ashbringer? Zandalar Tribe?
---
Dont let them know! its the only thing keeping me sane at this point.
---
Yeah removing a 10 second root is definitely better than removing a 10 second fear.....
---
Maybe if you're a warrior gnome is better, every other class definitely not.
---
Damn bro your hotkeys seem painful, do you have a mouse with 1-9 on it or something?
---
30/21/0
---
You don't get XP for battleground participation like you do now in retail.  As others are saying though, you will get a small amount of XP for killing NPC's  and such - but not nearly enough to warrant AV farming as a leveling strategy.

You do realize that the project to reverse ingeneer wow servers took years of work and has been done by people that aren't nostalrius.
---
There is no way they reverse ingeneer it exactly as blizzard implemented it, so it's obviously a different beast than classic and than vanilla. 
---
Plus blizzard is a real company which have legal and security constraint the pservers had not. 
---
Yes blizzard is a shit show, but you are comparing oranges and apple here.
---
Very interesting choice.   What are some of your goals besides destroying your BG bracket and humiliating 60’s?
---
Classic is even easier now because of the item rework.
---
My guild is clearing MC in like 1h30min, but just because it is easy. Like a quarter of the guild at least would be kicked from my guild in tbc/wotlk instantly.
---
As a warrior, this hurts my heart. Thank you for the meme haha
---
Retridins rise up!
---
The estimated honor displayed from a kill below 60 is broken. It'll yield you only very minuscule honor. 
---
I've always considered it good etiquette to not kill anything below level 58 since they have no chance of winning anyway.
---
Apparently, most classic players are not thinking the same way. After being ganked leveling my alts I started killing everything, no matter if grey, green or yellow.
---
I don't know :(
---
Yeah I really hate how this works in classic.
---
The world needs more of this.
---
If the raidleader is already saved you get automatically saved to their raidID when you enter.
---
I mean.. anyone who specifically rolled on a server to play with streamers, knows exactly what streamers are like. It's weird to say it's sad or infuriating then, right.. right??
---
This
---
He made an assumption for the sake of the argument, he didn't state a fact. His argument of "let's assume X people play classic, so..." holds true. You're the one who's challenging the assumption.
---
You realize we are raiding MC now with 300+ more spellpower on every caster compared to the original time people entered MC?
---
The content is nerfed to the ground.
---
Tanking is still a blast on Pallys believe it or not. Way to fight the good fight OP
---
The number of mechanics and the length of the fight are not the only things that determine difficulty. Groups that are killing rag in less than 3 minutes, have their preraid BIS, and are using consumes have already put in way more effort than anyone in retail LFR. The challenge of MC is being organized enough to get 40 people to learn fights and execute decently. LFR doesnt require that. That's why I say MC is more difficult.

How did you farm gold without getting corpse camped?

I'm the idea that valuable BoEs are a must need for everyone. Sorry I'm just not gonna gift 400 gold to a random out of the goodness of my heart. So thought the other 3 persons too...
---
You are doing the Light’s work my dude
---
It's not hindsight, bro. If you actually look at what he wrote, none of it was only known after launch. On name creation, we knew there would only be a small number of servers, and each and every one had queues already in the thousands, and Blizzard had stated there would be more players than were in Vanilla.
---
Just because you didn't see the signs early on doesn't mean they weren't there. Plenty of us used to play PvP realms back in the day but saw the hellscape that was coming, and chose to avoid it. How many times do people have to tell you: this isn't Vanilla, it's Classic.

Which results in realms dying, which I believe is in no one's interest.

I played like 8 to 10 h a day, left my GF to play freely now is all wasted
---
...says the player with years of video gaming (and likely world of warcraft) experience.
---
Majordomo requires 5 people to tank, 4 people to reliably CC,  and DPS not to pull aggro/break CC. everyone has a role to play, they have to pivot from one boss to the next to the next. it requires situational awareness and knowledge of your class, and can become a gear check for healers and dps. 
---
i've done this fight maybe a hundred times, but i've had one or two groups in classic that just oculdn't get it sorted. DPS pulled aggro; a tank tied early; healers went OOM; etc. 
---
trivial to someone doing mythic raiding in retail nowadays, but for new players? 
---
keep in mind many, many players will play wow by leveling to the cap, doing some 5 man dungeons, then maybe hitting some LFR and then unsubscribe until the next expasion.
---
I'd argue LFR &gt; classic wow raiding &gt; normal retail &gt; heroic retail &gt; mythic. Everyone has their thresholds of difficulty and experience.
---
&gt; if
---
There are servers where this is true, and the Alliance gank people. My server is only slightly Ally dominated and I have had Alliance willfully deathball, even before P2.
---
They happily camped flight paths in Retail when they got an extra Warmode bonus. 
---
The difference is all the complaints are from Alliance. I read countless threads about "boohoo Horde killing us". Meanwhile I found a whopping ONE comment that mentions getting ganked by Ally on Heartseeker, and the guy wasn't even bothered by it.
---
Then you really need to learn how to make better decisions in life. I don't know what to tell you.

---
It'll settle down when BGs come out. Why they introduced honor without introducing BGs j do not know.
---
I respect the right of players to PvP but there's no natural balance to what's going on now they've released honor at a time where most people are farming Ony and MC and there's nothing else to do in between. And say what you like but camping graveyards and flight paths is not good gameplay, it's toxic griefing.
---
Wrong, their whole party gets honor.
---
I’m multiboxing 5 gnome mages and having a “blast” soloing instances and kitting them all out with the drops.  Currently lvl 39 and have enough for their mounts 😁
---
Legit, but so many priests uses shield on me when I'm tapping. At this point I just don't care about your mana, just l2play.
---
Some people don’t know but you don’t actually have to talk to the NPC to get into MC. You can just jump out the window to his left.
---
Yeah and it's exclusively horde that ganks zones for hours to tryhard another +8 honor. /s
---
Whiners, wake up, this is both-sided and has nothing to do with faction imbalance, but with people being dicks.
---
Imagine bitching about not getting full honor from camping a flight path 24/7... you can fuck right off you cunt
---
'' I cleared naxx on private server I know what I'm doing!''
---
have to explain how to setup vuhdo cause he's taking friggin ages to dispell anything...
---
Get the below:
---
Mapster (to see the map without taking the whole screen. also you can see all the map discovered or make undiscovered areas foggy, your choice in settings)
---
Atlasloot (to check loot drops from dungeons)
---
neatplates (for health plates above enemies, also shows effects like bleeding, slow, etc on it)
---
classicauraduration (shows the timer on the debuffs you apply to targets like hamstring, rend, thunderclap, bleed)
---
OmniCC (this one goes hand in hand with classicaurduration. it shows countdown on cooldowns and debuffs aura buffs everything)
---
real mob health (shows the actual health of NPC)
---
LibClassicMobHealth-1.0 (used by the addon real mob health, just download it and don't worry about it :P)
---
details (for a dmg meter if you want it)
---
Vendor prices (shows how much any item sells at vendors)
---
Tradeskillmaster (shows auction price on items  and how many you have on you or any alt, whether in mailbox bank on bags; it does way way more but you don't need it for more atm)
---
Questie (for quest locations)
---
Characterstatsclassic (makes stats show similar to TBC and WotLK)
---
DejaClassicStats (similar to CharacterStatsClassic but it shows them like in BFA; choose one of them because the default view does not show you all the stats you need to know about)
---
Wide Quest Log (makes the quest interface better, it places the list of quests to the left and the quest description to the right)
---
ItemTooltipProfessionIcons (put a small icon in the tooltip of items in case it can be used for professions, so you know what to sell and what to keep)
---
Bagnon (Group all your bags into 1 bag)
---
SortBag (1 button click to sort out items in bags)
---
Prat 3.0 (makes the chat way easier to use, it colors people by their class and makes replying easier with /r and a lot more stuff)
---
Now for addons that will change the interface (none of the above will modify your interface in a way that require working on setting it up)
---
Titan Panel Classic (a bar at the top or bottom that include performance, time, gold, repair cost and any addon you want in order to not stack them on mini-map)
---
Dominos (replace the action bars of the original UI allowing you to customize them however you want)
---
Luna Unit Frame (very powerful tool that changes the player target party and raid frame and gives A LOT of options to customize)
---
SexyMap (Allow you to change the position and form of the mini-map. I advise getting it only to make map a square which allows you to see more)
---
Gatherer2 (save mining, herbs and fishing nodes that you used)
---
Quartz (Casting bars with timer; dno if you need it but if you plan on playing something other than warrior then you do)
---
This is not unbelievable at all.
---
It also lets you see another warlock's succubus that is invisible. That's about all of its pvp uses.
---
Implying you tried recruiting for key runs already, you could tag along for coffer runs. Pretty much right next to it, it's not that hard to convince your group to help you out
---
You asked why they enjoyed it. They explained it to you. Why are you arguing with them as if they're wrong to enjoy it?
---
we wiped two times yesterday at ragnaros besides having the raid on farm since many weeks. People were just not concentrated anymore and pushing it. I dont know if we even had a full wipe since we killed him the first time at all in MC. That really showed us that the content is not THAT easy actually, we are just good at doing it with our knowlege and game experience.
---
Doesn't matter, dispells just hit something and you can't "choose" what
---
I dunno, it's clearly subverting the "honorless target" mechanic.
---
Plus people that want to do a PhD in general.
---
There was a post about it a few days ago
---
the people getting to Molten Core now are likely extremely casual players, new to wow, or simply never pushed themselves into raiding before. 
---
the groups clearing rags in the first night of raiding in sept and october were people that pushed to 60 and had BiS in a few weeks. those people would find MC trivial, because they're likely veteran MMO players.
---
So the whole guild can get locked to a half cleared MC?
---
Yeah don’t do this just tell him the truth
---
Some of the lvl 35 fish can be turned in for the AQ war effort when that is released.
---
But instead of escaping you get sapped by a rogue.
---
Congrats. We are still working on Rag. Yesterday he had 25k left on our best try. I hope next ID He ll bite the dust.
---
Thankyou for the response!
---
paladin’s only have a few way to farm gold.. farming lashers is one of them and pretty decent money. especially with herb
---
Reading all these comments;
---
Does Thrash Blade really get replaced THAT quickly? I thought the proc was worth a lot more than the (slightly?) higher weapon damage from Krol.
---
This seems really opposite from my experience. Jed/Rend runs are quite easy, always done with 6man at most and often 5man. And have a couple of non 60s if doing it as 6.
---
Fastest? DM E - jump runs take about 10m
---
My guild usually has a rule of thumb for BRM PVP raids: If you're not locked to Molten Core then YOU DON'T GO DOWN THE CHAINS.
---
The nicest class players are druids, not warriors.
---
Warriors feels like 50/50 with superb egocentric dicks and really nice people.
---
This ratio strongly varies when it's not a tank, but a DPS warrior, these are just like mages most of the time.
---
queues are cross server. no one will have to wait.
---
Lost HoJ to a hunter...
---
just have your ghost ride the boat on the first corpse run and you will auto rezz when entering the new zone.
---
Hey. So I just heard of this LUF. I really enjoy the ability to bind my heals to one click heal, I can debuff and heal anyone in the raid by one click of my mouse. 
---
 You're saying LUF can do the same?  I like the clean look of it but don't want to be bothers with having to mouse over then hit the hotkey or select there frame and press a hot key, I'm just to slow for that lol. 
---
 Plus I have my down ranked heals on regular mouse then shift + for my max rank heals. Since right now I have shit healing power lol. 
---
 It's been 4 months I hope you see this lol.
---
You can get on roofs of buildings, doesn’t mean you should
---
Depends on how you play it. If you are a killing machine that never talk or emotes to other players, you won't have that much interractions. Otherwise, you will have some fucking great times with us.
---
How come only Alliance is crying about things that both factions do?
---
True, I missed the fact that he wanted a method that did not require him to lose his target. That does not exist afaik, but this method is still very powerful (powerful enough that it got disabled in retail).
---
I'm on Incendius, and it's probably the best server NA. It doesn't feel skewed at all.
---
So I see this guy has 2 points in improved charge instead of in two handed wep dmg, would you guys say this is better? Have anyone tested both ?
---
Get with the times gramps boomer means 30+ now
---
I don't recall them being particularly smooth with 6 randoms, and they're still useless for a tank.
---
You can get mobs onto the lift actually. I did it with Anachronos in BC a few times taking him to Org. It's super inconsistent and there was a decent chance he'd reset so I usually took the long way. With a smaller mob it would probably be easier though. 
---
I don't think you can take a mob on a blimp, well you could probably get them on but they would despawn when you changed zones but I've never tried it so maybe someone else knows.
---
Ward
---
The Open-PvP system with honor gains instead of loss when winning a 10v1 is a massive failure. Faction imbalance has nothing to do with this and is just used to justify someone's own whining.
---
Except that stances have their own cooldown separate from the gcd, is it's one click and instant to switch stance and use an ability with a macro.
---
It comes from Hearthstone, or at least became popular that way. One streamer (Amaz) would always say it when something extremely unlikely happened, and the subreddit started saying it a bunch too.
---
Not sure why that would be considered griefing
---
Rextroy beat you to the scoop with a level 36 Warrior.
---
Yes LUF has clickcast support. It should be fairly easy to figure it out on your own, but if you have trouble feel free to ask for help.
---
works great in DM:West and for eating Gar pulses
---
Naxx and Alterac Valley.
---
How are they useless? They drop bis items for both warriors and druid tanks.
---
That's the thing about luck mate, it's fucking random.
---
As long as you're enjoying the game play what makes you happy. Sometimes you gotta switch it up for a couple days then you come back to druid and you're like "OH YEAH THIS IS AWESOME TOO!!"
---
I’m not saying they are wrong to enjoy it.
---
They're really not though
---
Getting saved to another lockout in a raiding guild is a cardinal sin.  Also, they may think you are trialing with another guild.
---
yep.
---
Lol no.
---
Its a dick move for sure.
---
Nah you’re fetching. My experience has been very different. In fact the most difficult players I’ve ever dealt with in 5 mans has repeatedly been fury warriors. But I don’t think there’s more asshole warriors that’s just been how much experience has unfolded. Not an accurate representation of the whole just my experience.
---
You the man. Thank you!  Being a first time wow player it's crazy how much shit is out there but after 15 years it's understandable.
---
This is accurate except the boat is suppose to be full of horde as well.
---
I like to leave stealth right behind the opposite faction, hug them and then vanish once they get spooked out.
---
If a tank paladin goes oom he does it wrong.
---
No need to go oom really
---
&gt; Apparently they struggled to kill rag due to low dps last week and told the raiders they were required to buy 80g flasks of spell power for the following raids. 
---
Bro this tells you everything you need to know about this guild. Gquit now
---
Saving this for when I get home. I cannot count the number of times and over power procs during WW, and I tab spam to find the mob who dodged, only for the timer to run out :( and I waste rage. Thanks!
---
It took 5 Alliance to kill me repeatedly in a level 20 zone. They were high level and geared. 
---
Shame you guys speak righteously but cant act that way
---
We were 8 manning UBRS with lowbies, 3 healers and 1 60 Warlock DPS (twas a guild run).  Needless to say, I told the lock to keep tapping and I would keep him up. Needed him to carry lol.
---
I think it's mostly if your AoE dps takes aggro from the tank. Regaining control of a mob is resource heavy and when you're not getting hit you gain less threat.
---
"I don't think about the player, it makes me feel good"
---
We don't know if it's cleared, he'd have to check first
---
Well, now I know.
---
well the impression is I have in gehennnas - as a horde. Is that alliance are getting battle hardened and much more organised out of neccesity. They must go out with teams and with a plan while horde have the default advantage. While horde is even complacent ignoring the fights.
---
I guess we got hundred solo undead mages and rogues terrorizing the lands but alliance has the teams. Ofc I can be mistaken as I don't see the other side. Is horde controlling azshara flightpoints, attacking gates of stormwind, ganking and attacking what ever alliance uses in Feralas with some teams?
---
Also funny if we do, cos that's how it is xD each ganking while avoiding each other.
---
Seems like the server is only used by crybabies and the occasional exiled ninja that lost his reputation.
---
It's kind of funny that people transferring there claim that their reason is faction imbalance, but all they wanted is to be on the dominant side instead of fixing anything. Faction balance changes absolutely nothing about world-pvp as long as the system is screwed.
---
Mc people once they land from a FP wait 30 seconds and kill them for honor.
---
its more for ghosts and stuff ... use it in the graveyard at undercity for example for all the neutral ghosts that kill silly mages
---
You relate to a bug abuse. Guards are just getting glitched and cant reach you when they should..
---
This issue here seems more to me that a paladin can bop wsg flag keeper and take the flag himself(example).
---
4 times what
---
Using 1.12 talents, itemisation, and guides that are written with 15 years of knowledge going into them.
---
I was farming Mara basically the day I hit 60. You need very little gear to do it. I would highly suggest run speed on your boots for Princess though.
---
https://discord.gg/yD96b9
---
You could just admit you're exaggerating the time.. not a big deal because like you said, 15 min runs are optimal.
---
I went down the chains :(
---
How are you resetting?  I started the farm yesterday and I'm pretty efficient but I've just been suiciding to reset once I've cleared the bottom.
---
You just downrank consecration 2 levels and you can hold threat most often.  Make sure everyone has blessing of salv to lower their threat.
---
I only use max level consecration to burst my threat then switch out.  Then use JoW, BoW, and SoW and I never run out of mana.  I never have to stop unless it's a wonky ass butt pull from people wanting to skip something.
---
For raid tanking just use GBoK and spam it on the largest collection of a single class.  3-4 globals and you'll pull threat from the main tank no problem.  I've OTed MC once but most groups won't take me because I'm not a healer.
---
&gt;Amusingly, this means that anyone who kills opposite faction members on sight is nothing more than a racist murderer, and the reason we can't have nice things in Azeroth.
---
I thought it was established canon that we're all murder hobos?
---
Ok yea I should've put it differently. They do drop nice stuff, but you're going to need multiple full UBRS runs for shield &amp; belt anyway, it's better to get other dungeons out of the way first while they still grant XP.
---
Where do you get HealComm from? I wasn't able to find it on Twitch.
---
Due to 1.12 talents and itemisation. Ragnaros wasn't regularly killed before the first submerge in Vanilla.
---
It’s only bad if you play a server like faerlina where it’s got thousands of players a regular balance server doesn’t really have that issue
---
Rock band drum set is actually really good for mage.  Just bind everything to frost bolt and jam out.
---
I'm reading it now! That's where the idea came from! ^^'^
---
You only receive honor from the same target for 4 kills, not 10.
---
Completely agree, outplaying other players is impossible. IMO the only correct solution is a /sit macro so you die faster.
---
I bought all the mats for my lionheart helm and Im at 30g atm. 20s each is cheap for me, everything else feels fucking expensive right now :D
---
You guys chose to enter a city. Thats risk that comes with it.
---
100% he just tab-targeted.
---
If you willingly enter a thread wherein the OP asks people for examples of stupid wow players and then find someone who does just that, only to point that they are doing it, you're not so smart yourself
---
I was so bothered by this at first haha. The relief I now feel.
---
Fiery enchant will proc on reckoning... or possible its only proccing off the SoR hits associated with the Reckoning and spell batching is causing me confusion. I will have to double check and do some bombs without SoR up.
---
Dope. That’s where my horde toons are at. I started there to get a break from the constant dying on Krom!
---
I’m a bit confused. So does Healcomm work right now or does my raid need to install this one? We’ve def been having some issues lately
---
What has vanilla to do with that ?
---
Lol, all good here noob taco
---
Bruh ikr. I had to farm 100+ arena runs for that bad boy, sooooo much good gear in there though
---
You cant even rub it in rogues' faces as a shaman. You can with the hat and reed tho
---
"Wakanda was definitely my favorite"
---
Hell for us it's the mage loot that is almost non-existent. In 9 MC raids we got 1 arcanist bracer, no belt(not bis but still). 0 mageblade, 0 mana ignition cord, 0 spell power ring, 1x T1 helm, 1 ToeP &amp; 1 choker of the Fire Lord which both went to warlocks.
---
Meanwhile we have 6-7 rogues and they all have their belts and bracers (we started selling them) as well as at least 1 raid weapon each and one of them got the second bindings that dropped last week. Also only one of them doesn't have both the T2 helm and pants already. 5 Vis'kag (we do split runs for ony), 4 brutality blades, 3 Core Hound tooth, 3 band of accuria.
---
&gt;What is stopping horde from quein in undercity, go 10m to wpl/epl and corpsecamp in que?
---
There isn't
---
Source: played on a Horde dominated server (Mal'Ganis) where their BG queues were 30-60 min and ours were instant
---
How do I check it on hunter?
---
Not having tab set to enemy players only? Pfft.
---
If you push off winters chill, the mages are gonna be pissed off at you.
---
For starters what level are you?
---
It was probably a mistake. Even if it was on purpose that's not what greifing is.
---
Is it worth going deep into the protection tree for Concussive throw 5 sec stun for PvP as warrior? can it make the difference against mages, for example?
---
Yep!  And a lot of the placements for unit frames and other items are the default positions out of the box after install.
---
Hey, that’s my server
---
It's 10. You recieve 10% less for each kill. Source: I kill the same people 10 times all the time
---
From the discussion I’ve seen recently Thrash Blade &amp; Proc isn’t as bad as these people are making it sound but Krol is def better.
---
My mage is 22 and when I start looking for group I start making enough water for 1 stack per player and food for melee and locks.  It only takes a few minutes so I have to assume I'll become jaded over time, or the vast majority of 60 mages are cunts.
---
You also gotta remember, that once the new expack comes out a lot of people are gonna leave classic for shadowlands. Also they are gonna be pulling resources from classic dev team to work on shadowlands as they did say that retail wow is our main focus and that classic comes second.
---
And also pvp debuff fodder
---
I had trouble leveling as 24 last night. Thanks to Alliance.
---
Let's stop acting like Horde trying to get honor the only available way is "mean".
---
Lots of us did though.
---
&gt;like 60/40 at worst
---
That's a pretty meaningful difference though when you consider how populated it is
---
Low effort joke from a low effort faction.
---
Well yes ofc they could think that. Signing - and not turning - up for a raid is also a cardinal sin.
---
And nobody like liars. And it is a Kind of fun Story :P
---
I think he is good to tell his guild. Especially since he doesn't seem to be toooo hardcore if he has to ask These questions on reddit :D
---
Right now raiding is totally casual in terms of time, because you only have MC and Ony. The only problem is getting to 60.
---
You shouldn't waste your time arguing with these people.
---
If it's not about the server quality, it's going to be about the queues, or the server faction imbalance, or being camped, or...
---
Whatever.
---
Not defending Blizzard either, as if you're not satisfied you just cancel your sub, but don't waste your energy trying to fight off salt, it's like trying to convince someone on Facebook.
---
I can sustain max rank concentration currently as long as I want.
---
It is enough without improved righteous fury to hold aggro with salvation.
---
Have wisdom seal and judgement on target
---
Horde on Heartseeker, we feel you.
---
I think a lot of players got the short end of the stick with their first guild, because a lot of the first guilds I've seen were by primarily selfish players. My first guild did the same, and they've now lost two tanks (me, as OT, and then 4 weeks later they made the MT quit when he didn't get Binding of the Windseeker). 
---
Honestly though, it's far better for this to happen right now than it is for this to happen later in the game.
---
This is how hatred between horde and alliance is built! Thou shall always hate each other. I believe this occurred before the honor system rolled out.
---
Do you think a holy priest could farm these with holy nova?
---
I try to keep it simple so the horde still understand they're being insulted.
---
This thing has almost a 50% drop chance, so at least it doesn't hold you back for long 😀
---
In agree that he should tell his raid leader as well. My point was if he tried to hide it they would think he was trialing with a new guild.
---
Seriously?
---
Maybe if your raid leaders are complete dipshits.
---
Not as a raid/dungeon rotation though...
---
If I forgot water I'd just lifetap and bandage while the healer drinks. Never got a single complaint in all my runs.
---
But all of those points apply to everyone in classic, so how does that make Rag and Majo a challenging fight in classic?
---
Naxx, i wanna top meters in patchwerk fight
---
How do you not follow that?
---
Ragnaros is nerfed compared to the way he was. He's a mechanically challenging fight made easier today because we've been handed huge advantages.
---
Players that are new to the mechanics still need to learn them.
---
Lol rogues are easily the worst type of players in the game. Toxic, bad and think they are anything special with their brainless 3 button combo while playing one of the most overpopulated and dispensable classes in the game.
---
No there’s a second roll you don’t see. Alphabetically would be an awful way to solve it.
---
It was changed to 10 kills in a later patch.  Maybe in tbc.  That information isn’t accurate.  In vanilla it’s 4 kills.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23221132
---
Ahhh, wheres the best place for lasher farming? Good to know about the deathbone set tho.
---
Honestly, guild run is probably the best way. Either that or some other folks who need the key, but it could take a while to find a group, as you pointed out. I do still see people advertising for key runs, so you're definitely not alone.
---
I mean they can be, the average player is pretty average at this game. Clicking spells, poor movement etc.
---
Many runs of mine in MC pugs have had countless wipes on random trash and some bosses.
---
Hey that’s my old guild lol
---
 2g/stack is really expensive and a really bad idea to use if you’re aoe farming for gold. It ends up taking a huge chunk out of your gp/h
---
Not true. Not a single realm is gonna die before battlegrounds get released and then everybody moves over there instead. Therefore people transitioning to pve just makes the game more fun for the ones that actively hunt and the pve players that don't want to log in will just have a break from the game for a few weeks.
---
It's almost like people weren't saying from day 1 to get 60 in P1 because P2 would be very hard to level. I understand that people don't always have a lot of time, but this wasn't some big surprise.
---
True that dude, in the grand scheme we've only played a small portion of the game. So much left to do and enjoy, no reason to lock yourself down with a bunch of try hards that turn the game into a chore.
---
On Firemaw I feel the Alliance "owns" everything except maybe Winterspring. It is a very healthy server, but also sadly has 1k-2k queues on raidnights
---
Yeah, everyone on that server is miserable tbh.    Super low horde population and Ally who camp every flight master.  Faction based queues would fix so much..
---
There are no mechanics at rag mate, except for melees go out of range every 30 secs that’s it
---
Does surviving mean you were lowest on the DPS charts though..?
---
I played vanilla up to beginning of TBC before I quit, roughly 80 days played. 15 years later, I'm up to 25 days played now in Classic. I still have never seen an epic boe drop while I was solo. Seen 3 or 4 in higher level dungeons in a group and never won one of those either. Some people really do get all the luck, I'm here to balance all their luck with my no luck. 
---
I have also only gotten 2 boe blues in my current 25 day classic run, just lol..
---
Yeah this is some bullshit. I defended a group member after the tank got super mad they were doing low damage even though we were progressing fine and had no issues whatsoever. He attempts a vote kick, and it fails, so he intentionally team wiped and started a vote kick against me.
---
Though I was playing with a friend, and he didn’t get a vote for some reason, and the vote kick passed, so the player I defended must have accepted the vote kick so fuck him too I guess.
---
Regardless tanks are fucking divas. If one overpulls, they can just blame the healer and I’ve gotten kicked before over that. And another time, one player went to turn in the ogre tannin quest, prolonging the dungeon overall by a few seconds at most. This enraged the tank, so he started a vote kick, and when it failed he intentionally team wiped, prolonging the dungeon by an order of magnitude more than what he got mad over.
---
Fuck tanks in general. When I’m tank, I take the blame, don’t get too harsh and really only shit on people that intentionally fuck with other players.
---
Congrats on getting your leaf and on finding a great guild! It 100% makes it a ton more fun to play when you have a good group! 
---
What is your server/guild? 
---
Also good luck with the quest! It is not easy but really fun, so take your time and dont be afraid to ask for help! I'm currently at 3/4 with only the Burning Steppes demon left, which shouldnt be too difficult. If you need any tips, let me know! :)
---
Bad day at work?
---
Don't feel bad, I haven't even seen a boe blue drop for me, either in classic or back in the day in vanilla.  not one fucking drop.

Currently level 43 and questing in Tanaris, hoping to do some ZF Farming soon as the WPVP is a bit of a mess right now.
---
I am looking for more casual players or a guild to participate in DG runs, Questing and some BG's in the evenings for a few hours most days.
---
End Game I would like to participate in Pre-made BG groups and some casual Raiding, I'm not huge on PVE but happy to re-spec Ele/Resto/Enhance as needed.

Also leveling LW and Skinning for some basic gear, I intend on swapping to Eng / Alch after acquiring said gear.

Uh no?
---
You think we want to pvp this way? Fuck no bit blizzard chooses to bring out the tank system when most people are 60 already. Not our fault we have to camp flight paths to get honor. We gonna do what we have to do.
---
Dude, I feel this so badly right now. I Main Tanked an Onyxia run last night, first time ever organizing and coordinating a raid. Told everyone I've never done this before, but I read up on the fight.
---
I wiped us on the first pull of the first trash mob. Accidentally pulled the second one and we got destroyed.
---
My soul is still shivering from the silence during that corpse run.
---
Never did get the kill, turns out the people who said they knew the encounter didn't remember the reason I lost aggro on Onyxia wasn't due to the damage doing too much in P1, or me not doing my job well enough, but because she shaves aggro off the top with a randomly activated ability, so if the other tanks were not high on the threat list (which they were not, being told to only do white damage), then she went to 2nd highest and THAT wiped us until people just started leaving.
---
It was a humbling experience, and I'm glad I know more now than I did before last night. Still can't get past the fact that my lack of knowledge wiped all of those people, but I suppose it happens.
---
&gt;This makes no sense.
---
Just gonna stop reading right there.
---
It makes perfect sense, it's how the event API's function within WoW when called by LUA.
---
Also, you can change the API like you are describing but THEY WON'T CHANGE IT THAT WAY.
---
They are not going to radically overhaul the information the combat log displays because of one fucking addon, I don't know how many times I have to repeat this.
---
The only other way to filter it would be to create a second API that had only the information that whiners on the forums/reddit believe should be available and no one agrees on what information that is.
---
Again, they will not create a new WoW UI API for ONE addon. Period.
---
The hotfix that reduced range is all that's ever going to happen, ever.
---
Also, a lot of people don't want the combat log API fucked with in the first place, all you people saying 'would', 'could', 'should' about how to 'fix' it forget this. 
---
Nothing "HAS" to happen, deal with it.

I'm not able to insta kill most of the lowbies left in the world. Almost all of them are paladins now and they can delay timings
---
I read that a single HK can be equal to hours of farming in some cases. But that’s just secondhand info.
---
&gt;Seriously though well done. People trivialise MC because it's been deconstructed to death and servers are flooded with people who farmed the place on private servers, so it's nothing new to them.
---
And people spam consumables to trivialize the content.
---
A jump run is a run of Dire Maul East where a healer and tank farm the bosses for loot and generally avoid the trash mobs. After the final boss, there's a shaft with 2-3 thorium veins. The chance for arcane crystals make these runs especially lucrative. There are also some nice herbs which can add to the gold total. Search for jump runs on YouTube for more info.
---
Do this on that little bridge that connects to the boat. People trying to get on often miss the boat.  Plus sometimes you can get multiple people at once.
---
I think you missed the part where they **chose** to play on a server with the people they are complaining about. If you don't find that silly, then we'll just have to agree to disagree about it man. No hard feelings.
---
Interesting, I guess with your succubus buff and the SM it’s still an increase of 25% shadow damage. 
---
Probably not quite as good at the destruction talents to get ruin but still decent I guess. Thanks!
---
Learning the mechanics brand new is still a challenge. That this guy's group did ok doesn't mean *everyone's* group will do ok.
---
Get in to a group with an alt. Log out and I'm on your alt. Wait two minutes for the game, reset the instance and relog your main again. You'll now be at the entrance with new lashers to farm!
---
Full dots shadowburn deathcoil fear at that point they are half dead and you are full hp now factor in two sacrifices (no rage for warrior) and a health stone. On top of that engineering and consumables. Warlock also taking half dmg with soul link. Warlock is easy af.
---
wew, the  flamegame is stronk in this butthurt zoomer.
---
To filter out troll answers?
---
Way to forget all the people that helped you get world first with layering abuse bud.
---
Send your pet in, run past the mob then feign death to reset
---
You can set up mana bars. Create a bar indicator and set it to show mana.
---
I thought it was broken tooth
---
Ty for precising. Yeah i feel like warriors are only good vs rogue twinks.
---
You can set grid2 to show mana. Create a bar indicator and use it to show the mana status.
---
I mean you clearly aren't even aware of the threat drop so... yeah.
---
Did you make good money selling those Giant Eggs though?
---
I'm maining a hybrid tank/resto druid this time around, after going pure heals in vanilla.  I give that context, because over the last couple months I've seen all three sides of the game in dungeons.
---
Now, I'm not going to disagree that what you need to know depends on the role you play.
---
However...I can say for certain that my responsibility and level of stress is very different depending on what role I'm playing.  DPS is simple...i follow the marks, i do damage and try not to do anything especially dumb like butt pulling.  Healing is more responsibility, but mostly i just focus the tank and spot heal everyone else, i keep range and generally know which mobs might be more annoying than most.  Tanking...the entire dungeon is on my shoulders to manage, I need to know which things have to die first, tell CC how to do their job, manage the balance between not rushing and not delaying, babysit DPS that can't manage threat, teach people their role (e.g. not to CC before I pull).
---
I'll put it this way...i can DPS black out drunk, i can heal while tipsy, but if I'm tanking an endgame dungeon, I'm never more than buzzed.
---
Since the HK system dropped, you can't even take a boat from Menethil/Booty Bay due to the sheer amount of horde camped out on the docks and in the boats.
---
There are literally 100+ horde in blackrock mountain at any given time, just waiting for groups of alliance to come in. 
---
Can't fly to Thorium Point or Morgan's Vigil without a full raid, as horde have the flight paths camped out. 
---
In Everlook, the only way to get to the alliance flight path in Winterspring without dying 2-3 times is to hop the wall and pray. Rogues ganking in the Inn, horde working to pull the guards out of town and slaughtering as many alliance in town as they can, etc. 
---
EVERY. SINGLE. DUNGEON is camped out by horde. There is not a single 55+ dungeon you can go too that isn't camped out with a dozen horde in front of it.
---
I like pvp. I chose to play on a pvp server thinking I knew what I was getting myself in too. The 10:1 horde to alliance ratio has made anything but raiding almost entirely unplayable at this point.
---
Hahaha, 'killed by 1', that's a good one!
---
That happened to me aswell. I helped a Gnome Mage killing a mob, I then sit to drink, he turns around and kills me.
---
Firemaw is horde dominated. With most people claiming a 70/30 ratio for horde/alliance. Horde very much "owns" Plaguelands both East and West, Un'goro, Tanaris and Sithilis the majority of the time.
---
But put a fraction of the effort to bring good dps to the raids?
---
Then they have a bug on their hands because I get 10% I've tested this many times
---
Right on man I appreciate it, we're Loot Goblins on Deviate Delight and just got our first Rag kill Saturday night. Feels good to be a part of a successful guild that has everyone's best interest in mind. Cant wait to get started though! Gonna start my first attempt tonight, hoping my sinew drops on Tuesday!
---
Anathema is alliance favored but also less populated server if anyone wants a no-queue time option.
---
My issuse with az is how the boss is tagged. You legit have to have a tank, 3 healers and a warlock camped there 24/7. Because you talk to him to get the tag. After someone gets the tag its near impossible for them to wipe.
---
he wasnt even in my raid but we still got credit for the dhk
---
Will look for it too. Thank you! So far as I am a single target I didnt feel like I need it but i am still a low level :)
---
I'm not disagreeing with you but I've run with a guild that struggled to down rag. People not being full pre raid bis, melee dps pulling aggro when the tank gets blasted and the off tank is working to pick rag up, tank healers getting blasted away from poor positioning, dps not bringing fire pots, etc.
---
Joke's on you. Get rekt.
---
Thats the beauty of the grid2 addon. 
---
It is simple at first glance, but it can be configured a lot and do pretty much everything you can think of. It looks like incomprehensible  arcane sorcery at first, but when it clicks its really awesome.
---
http://murlocparliament.com/how-2-grid2 check this guide.
---
i would think so if your gear is good enough! might be too much dmg for cloth though
---
Thank you! Will download it after work.
---
Yeah I really should clean it up tbh but I'm just too lazy to set up all the macros and keybinds lol.
---
I turned them in to a metric crap ton of Monster Omelets that I use for the well fed buff when grinding. Also sent a bunch of them to alts and friends.
---
I got a whisper asking for a rez while I was out and about on my druid. I dismount and burned my 30 minute CD and a reagent to help this guy out and he just runs off with no thank you or anything. 
---
I assume he didn't realize druid's didn't have an out of combat rez in vanilla, but still, even if someone goes out of their way to Rez you fucking thank them.
---
The fact that you were wrong about what life would be like on a PvP server now, means your judgement is wrong. You are unreliable when it comes to making predictions. Leave it to the people that predicted the current predicament: life won't improve by that much after BGs drop. It only takes a small percentage of people to ruin things for everyone, and queues are going to be a lot longer than you think they will be, even with cross-realm.
---
Maybe tanks need a channel to arrange something like a guided tour or help in general. I certainly wouldn't mind going to a dungeon with a new tank and give some pointers for the dungeon. I just wouldn't want to provide unsolicited advice as I feel that would be kind of annoying for a tank trying to do their own thing without some know-it-all in tow.
---
This kind of stuff is nuts to me. A good GM and good officers should kind of know that their hard work is in seeing a cohesive, well-run quick raid week after week, not in tangible rewards. They should more than likely be bottom priority for loot unless they're a main or secondary raid tank solely to avoid loot drama.
---
Key ring :c
---
Someone from the raid had to tag it
---
Cant have 3 consecutive and min length 3 so Aab would be the OP
---
Lol blizzard needs to pay attention to this shit, pretty clearly an exploit
---
I am curious about item rack addon!
---
Also about nodes...That gonna be really helpful since minnig is quite hard atm to push past 90+ when I am only finding copper ones everywhere...
---
grid 2, clique, and proper weakauras is all you need.
---
I still remember a tank from my server in Vanilla. The guy was a legend as he could not (or would not at least) speak/understand *any* English at all. Thankfully the guy was in the other boat compared to yours, he always knew what to do.
---
 ***&lt;Afterlife&gt;*** is looking for new members, level 45+! Our goal is to clear all raiding content, create a social community of people who enjoy the game in all it’s aspects (PvP, Twinking, Raiding, Dungeon running, Reputation farming) if you have a positive attitude and mindset then you are what we are looking for.

---
**What are we looking for?**  We are seeking active players that want to be apart of Afterlife and grow as a guild community.    
---
**Classes in High Demand**  We are in need of Warrior DPS and Warlocks

But what mechanics are challenging? Golemag doesnt have any worth considering, Rag's mechanic for casters is standing atleast 8 feet away from another, for meeles simply running away every 30secs for 5 secs. That Lava Dog (2. Boss) simply requires you not to stand in fire. Majo being the only boss that might require some explanation and then gets easy.  
---
The only real challenge is finding 40 people that want to invest the time into the game to reach 60 and have atleast some gear.
---
Sub rogues depend on openers to deal high burst damage. Literally the antithesis of what you want for raid pve dps because you can't use any of your ppners except say ambush effectively and raid pve dps is about high sustainable white damage. 
---
So long story short, no. Unless you can find a way to get hemorrhage and adrenaline rush in classic, good luck. I think you need something crazy like 1400 AP with a 2.9 AP to match the sustainable damage of SS on bosses, and even then you're still missing a lot of key pve dps talents like hit%, weapon skill, blade flrurry and dual wield damage.
---
I don't understand where these Arena/Angerforge spammers are on Bloodsail. Putting together a group for that is like pulling teeth for some reason, even when throwing in Golem to entice healers.
---
A hunter guildy was asking for people to help him get his BRD key done and he eventually put a group together and needed just a healer so I decided to help out. 
---
We get to Angerforge and HoJ drops. Tanks obviously excited and rolls need. So does the hunter, wtf. Hunter wins and everyone basically spends 5 minutes wondering why he's ninjaing a HoJ off of a tank in a guild group while pointing out it doesn't trigger on ranged attacks. Ok, he's just an idiot, whatever. 
---
Moving on, we are in the bar and he says to the party he needs to "afk 5 mins for his weed guy". Whatever, we move on, clear the first trash pack past bar and start fighting Ambassador. Who shows up in the middle of ambassador fight with a pack of mobs wiping the group? You guessed it, the hunter. 
---
After another 5 mins of people tearing into the guy he /gquits. So the final tally is after his level 56 ass solicits help from guildies he ninja loots HoJ, afks to buy drugs, wipes the group during a boss fight he wasn't present for, and then /gquits. 
---
To put the cherry on top, 2 weeks later the tank he ninjaed from has moved on to a new guild, and the old guild actually reinvited the hunter. 
---
I'm not even shocked anymore honestly.
---
I understand what you are saying, but all this stuff is based on people being lazy OR not listening... there is no skill involved or anything ....
---
They aren't that good in my experience. I just use 3 unique keybinds.
---
How do you know he's going to equip it? Because he said he would?
---
Thank you! Will check each on of these and download them!
---
This is why I don’t like DKP as a loot system. Creates an incentive for guilds to DE items that could otherwise be used.
---
Even if the ratio were 70/30, the Alliance have had full control over Burning Steppes, BRM, Searing Gorge, and EPL (at least when I have been online). Of course I have no doubt that the Horde can't control it as well, but it just hasn't been my experience the last couple of days. So I might just have been unlucky on the times I've been in those zones
---
Can you please elaborate on where it is? Cause I can't find the live chat...
---
It actually does. Make it as big as the action bar and hide empty action bar buttons..
---
"Come get farmed, you Horde sons of bitches"
---
Is there a grid for classic?
---
Fantastic job man!
---
One thing you have to keep in mind, the people doing that will suffer from crippling depression or whatever other debilitating mental ailment is causing them to camp flight paths. They have to suffer from that the rest of their life, you only get inconvenience for a brief period of time!
---
In original, Servers that didn't get the doors open, were prepared to have the doors open anyway with a certain patch. However there was a long time between when the doors could be opened, and when the doors would open themselves.
---
That is not what I said, people on the lower populated faction just dont give a fuck about pvp anymore which is really frustrating. (Hence the 10 hordes infront of the capital city)
---
Youre absoluteley right, my bad. 
---
Didnt really take into account that you usually run it with 10 ppl.
---
Yeah, I've read a couple of them but they were a bit too complex for me at this point of the game. However it helped me a bit with talents :)
---
But was it a waste of time if he enjoyed it?
---
Imagine writing some bullshit which u cant back up and just replying with r/randomRedditLink.
---
I leveled my mage by aoeing, and have farmed up over 2k gold in zf since hitting 60, and I haven't seen a single boe epic yet
---
Done!
---
Suuuuuuure ya do
---
&gt;butt pull
---
I've always called it a face pull, but I'm gonna have to switch terms because this is too accurate.
---
Well they don't vanish either.  They just keep smacking it till one of them is dead lol.
---
It's just a dumb probability joke. People have been making it in the poker scene for at least the 15 years I've been in it and likely even longer.
---
DM west to not get caught off guard by the ghost patrols
---
hes probably vegan
---
Yes, they're using an exploit to avoid the honorless period of time
---
Thank you so much for each details! I know now which one I need asap and what they do :)
---
Can someone explain this a bit more clearly? Doesnt make any sense the way it was worded in the post...
---
Its sounds like regular pvp with the added step of dueling a party member for no reason?
---
None of them work. FD doesn't seem to be dropping aggro right in PVP (bug?). The usual one that is posted everywhere needs to be double clicked to work and even then, it's only works say...40% of the time.
---
Sorry for whatever you are going through that makes you act this way. Reviewing your comment history is sad and I hope you somehow find happiness soon.
---
Yeah, but "Warmest Regards" fuckin got me.
---
You bastard! Nice man!
---
This could be easily resolved by putting a 1 minute immunity on people that have recently rezed... it's a fucking joke how bad the world pvp is on unbalanced servers. Corpse run 10 times to get where you need to be.
---
I'll just say as a decently geared 60 hunter, just because someone on youtube can solo something doesn't necessarily mean that it's easy or even plausible to do as a casual player. That's why you don't see every hunter on your server just wrecking solo trib runs, it's difficult to do and has very little margin for error. That said it is possible, just more time investment than alot of people are willing to put forward
---
Blasted lands has always been stupid to level in. 60s are always there getting their buffs
---
I usually run with a hunter both lvl 33. We smack almost everyone in STV. Then a 60 will come by and steamroll us. The escort quest in redridge sucked. Failed it at least 4 times and on the last time a skull troll Hunter stopped and followed us about halfway back. It was intense. Then he mounted and headed off. I've yet to be corpse camped but I find wpvp amazing even with the occasional steamroll
---
&gt; Warrior is without any dicussion the WORST 1v1 class
---
Thank you for this. I stated this in my /g and they said "l2p". I might be the worst pvp'er on the server, but still...
---
It's not a glitch, it would be considered an exploit
---
Back in TBC when I was like 14 and learning to raid I posted my laughable bindings and the best advice I got was shifting to ESDF for movement. Gives you all the letter keys on both sides of your movement keys bindings. So shift 1 through 6 then Q W A Z X C V G T R and all their shift variances. Sill not enough keys for everything in classic. I use mouse bindings too for healing
---
I have mine as shift scroll on my hunter with stay as a thumb button, I haven't had any issues with it so far.
---
&gt; or the vast majority of 60 mages are cunts
---
Mostly they are, more than other classes. My theory is that they cherish themselves as divine beings after copying some "spellcleave" videos, earning free endless cash from AoE farming and making portals/water. That's causing them to think they're the elite class of classic and everyone wants them.
---
&gt; It only takes a small percentage of people to ruin things for everyone
---
What the fuck are you doing on a PvP server with that type of mentality?
---
Why would you not swipe if you have a ton of ragw. You're ignorant.
---
I feel as if it's one of those things I wouldn't waste the gold on. Like I see people wanting Dal-Rends set but I'm just like.... Thrash Blade?
---
Ashbringer is pretty good i think
---
Are you serious? lmfao.
---
I noticed horde has a funny way to troll alliance by corpse camping them 24/7. I laugh every time I run back to my corpse.
---
The elementals in north west corner, but there's likely gonna be 60s farming them so probably better off elsewhere
---
When you pass a fast-food restaurant and ask if you can get something and your mom says there's food at home.
---
Well. Looks like fun xD
---
Please check 4 at night for me. I'm just curious xD
---
As a druid I enjoy rooting random people and running away, rank 1 if a lowbie
---
Shift scroll is smart.  Not so easy to just finger twitch and wipe a raid
---
It all depends on your  and your partys experience. If you know what's up, it should be easy and fast walk through. I suggest partying with someone who knows where to go and what packs need special attention.
---
Nothing comes close to BRD time wise. Lbrs should be about 75 minutes, scholo 90 minutes with Jandice (without her probably 80 minutes), strat live 1h, UD about 75 minutes. 
---
DME should be easier, around 40 minutes, DMW can be harder, like 1h. Haven't run DMW or tribute runs yet. UBRS is like 90 minutes I think.
---
These are rough guesses based on my past experience, avarage runs.
---
i’m doing lashers but can i ask how you do hydro as a priest? i can burn down the stealthed satyrs 1 at a time if i have full health and mana but it’s always pretty close so i can’t imagine how i’d do hydro
---
Doing the same on my alt, plus Cannibalize.
---
Generally I just shoot the healer a short "if I tap OOC, just don't heal me unless you feel like it or have the mana". All of them were happy I messaged them and said it's not a problem.
---
Well we’re in the 2nd week of honor.... I landed in thorium point and joined in on people killing the opposite faction as they landed. I was told that I needed to leave and that a top 10 ranked pvp player was farming here and I was “griefing his honor”. Star struck by this pvp god I kindly refused as I was waiting for my dungeon group. He demanded the name of an officer in guild which I refused to give...until he messaged every single person online to find one. He soon found out that I was the raid leader and immediately “blacklisted” my entire guild and said we were doomed. Blueface &lt;Ego&gt; on Whitemane US if you’re reading this...I’m still cringing at the fact that you feel the slightest bit of entitlement 1 week into the honor system.
---
You're lucky. My most recent encounter involved a dwarf taking my mining nodes while I was fighting next to them and then laughing and spitting on me. I play a human so it was even more jarring that it happened :(
---
Lol. It would be considered an exploit. Using game mechanics to circumvent part of the game that was not intended by the developers.
---
The Felhunter buff Paranoia does help against rogues and feral druids though.
---
Ty :D
---
That’s smart
---
(IC) Then you are dead to me! :D
---
We taught a lion to eat Tofu!
---
I think he does lol
---
I changed my pet abilities (well  macros) to shift scroll up and shift scroll down, so you can still zo camera.
---
I have a shift modifier as an easy thumb button on my mouse, so it is feels very fluid to use.
---
&gt; Yeah alliance are doing the same thing.
---
&gt; 
---
suuuuure they are
---
Thaddius jump is the real skill test. :p
---
Thats actually horribly unlucky and I feel for you.
---
I use lesser invis pots in pvp all the time. No warlock ever sees me because they never buff themselves with this.
---
You abuse the ledge and kite the boss back and forth, it pretty much glitches out and you should never get hit. Just google it, warlocks do it the same way.
---
Id say 31/10/10. 
---
Shockadin is best build for pvp due to your lack of mobility. 
---
10 in protection to get improved devotion aura (helps when because pallies end up wearing a lot of cloth and leather) and imrpoved blessing of freedom/protection. Gives near constant uptime of freedom on a nearby warrior. Then precision because a little hit chance never hurt anyone. 
---
10 in ret. benediction, improved judgement and improved SotC. Rarely get to use SotC in a pvp situation but will help in pve content. 
---
Ofc you could drop precision and SotC to grab 5% parry as well.
---
It's not a glitch, it's an exploit
---
They are excellent movies, for their time :P I especially started to like HappyMinti in his TBC era, but that's just me.
---
Sadly the Staff is worth nothing :/
---
Well one has 12 letters and five i, the other one only 7 letters and two t.
---
No idea why you would think they are the same.
---
Luckiest thing I did LBRS the other day, got our mage some pants from the first boss, I got my slaghide gauntlets of the monkey from Urok and our rogue got the cloud runner belt from the quartermaster. On top of all of that we got 2 mage tailoring patterns from the pyromancers!
---
Gotta get that paranoia on
---
What is the purpose of a consumable if not to make you more powerful? How about you unequip rings or trinkets next time too lol
---
No one has answered your question yet. Here are the things that won't be replaced by PvP gear

1. Lionheart Helm

2. Onyxia tooth pendant

3. Painweaver band

4. Hand of Justice

5. Blastershot from MC

here is [my character and my current gear](https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/FpZJF8n6AympTFfdBStMj/set/mddnsCrbMsrV3Wp4KziaQ)
---
I had a 47 paly and finally figured out I wasn’t going to enjoy that character at 60. So even though I fell way behind my friends and guild mates I rolled a warrior. But it was the right decision for me. We’re now all lvl 60 and raiding and I’m loving the offtank / fury life.
---
Hmmm dispel fodder you say? Interesting tactic, I like it. 👍
---
This makes each run take 2-3x as long as soloing Princess, which leads to terrible gold per hour for the person clearing for you. And you potentially have to do hundreds of these runs. 
---
You are getting carried hard in that situation. It's not practical.
---
Someone mentioned a while ago that it works that way. But the new Bob has to be on a different account. So you have to ask a friend to create Bob or have a second account to do it yourself
---
Griefing as in hes being a douchebag, not griefing as in "punishable" by Blizzard.
---
You invited him into the raid.
---
Camping a FP in a very high traffic area is extremely efficient what are you on about? They literally come to you on a silver platter and it's also one of the best ways to catch someone who's afk because a lot of people set up a FP and walk away.
---
Healers will *not* cast rank one heals unless it's a spell the class got late while leveling. Spells learned before level 20 give a giant penalty on +heal.
---
My favorite is in the badlands where there are like 10 'patriarchs' within 50 yards.
---
If they are that hardcore about kicking people, they likely would be active enough to have had people online to see OP in MC for an extensive period of time trialing.
---
It seems like they did that on purpose to try and get horde to push through the choke point, there was very little horde resistance and there was about 80 of them. So, I don't think they were retreating.
---
No where did they say they chose to. Get outta here please.
---
I'll vent here since I don't want to rock the boat in our guild each week.
---
How the *fuck* are people not bringing their amulets with them? You have like 80 slots of inventory. You really can't be bothered to make that 79 slots instead and have the one item you need to do the *twice* a week raid? The raid that, if you *forget* this item, cause a few dozen people to waste their time and get punished for being prepared?
---
I can't imagine having such a thick skull that after each Onyxia kill I feel the need to go bank my neckpiece for that *one* extra slot.
---
Literally every week we have a different person than last week forgetting their onyxia neck.
---
/rant
---
The books don’t come from corpses. It’s a lootable item on the ground.
---
Never seen alliance in the open world sorry
---
Doesn't this just remove part of the incentive to group around a FP? I don't see how this is a bad thing. Roaming around and finding players to actually fight SHOULD be more productive than waiting for defenseless folks to land. That's the whole reason that Honorless Target exists, to keep folks from doing this. The mind control workaround isn't the issue. Honorless Target should last longer and persist through death to end flight path honor farming.
---
Warcraftlogs already shows that alliance only makes up ~40% of end game players in EU, and it's out of a total of 100K players, so roughly 10% of the population. Also, for classic, alliance is "the PvE faction" thanks to paladins, so the percentage of alliance logging raids should be higher than horde. Also, horde has always been the premiere PvP faction. In retail 70% of players rated above 1800 in arena are horde. In classic racials are even more skewed towards horde for PvP. There's literally nothing that suggests anything aside from horde having long queues. Welcome to reality.
---
Without having to re-level it?
---
Oooph how low is the economy on your server? Black lotus averages around 140g on mine and average farm time for me is around 1 lotus in 3 hours if i am lucky.
---
I didn't even realize what OP was complaining about until I read this post (and some of his responses further down the thread)
---
But yeah, salty as you are I agree with you.  No sympathy for someone who's camping a flight path and getting butthurt that he can't share honor with the other assholes camping a flight path by getting a couple swings in on the target
---
Wrong! The guy in the video actualy got away without dying.
---
I play horde on Kromcrush and I will say I feel like the faction imbalance isn’t that bad. I would guess it’s either 60/40 or 55/45 in favor of the horde. I personally like to pvp in Un’goro since level 60 Alliance constantly camp Marshall’s Refuge and in my experience there is often more level 60 Alliance than horde in the zone. Same goes for EPL and WPL, I find the alliance in these zones out number horde and run around in bigger groups. Whereas the horde in these zones are usually farming herbs/mining or solo/duo pvp. The only place where the horde almost always outnumber alliance is in Blackrock Mountain.
---
I genuinely think that horde care less about wpvp than alliance on Kromcrush. Welcome, Lifted and NICE YOUNG MEN for example have big groups in what feels like every zone all day long. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been camped by groups of Alliance outside Dire Maul at this point. 
---
I do have a full time job though so this could just be due to the times I play at.
---
When I was playing my main, that's what I would do. I'd give like 60 stacks of water to the healer from the start and 20 or 40 to the dps, 20 or 40 food to the tank.
---
Now that I play my druid I have to ask for water EVERY FUCKING TIME. Like am I such a unicorn mage ??
---
Whooosh.
---
Ah yeah those give spirit IIRC. Great for grinding.
---
I did this farm for around 1300+ gold and haven't seen a single epic. Quit hogging em bud.
---
Look for some YouTube videos. Skarm has a pretty good one. I got rid of a lot of my macros after getting item rack. But the one I do use often is a single button for hamstring/charge.
---
No it doesn't, it shows your coordinates. 
---
Maybe it says like "last seen searing gorge" or something but that's not really...helpful
---
Wow, that’s actually super solid advice. I never would have thought of that, I’ll definitely try it out! I’m also thinking of getting a mouse that has more buttons for my totems so that I don’t have to bind them all to keys (maybe just the oh-shit ones)
---
Also useful in DM:W (ghosts) or any dungeon with invisible mobs wandering around.
---
There are several warlock curses that don't do damage but cause threat

Hi, /u/FEAREDWILDCAT

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1hd3v/what_dungeon_do_i_do_after_stockades/). 
---
I agree with your conclusion, (running half-UBRS runs isn't worth it for him) but not with this statement at all. 
---
Gyth's Skull is good if you can find either of Fire Resistance or Nature Resistance (for future content), Warmaster's Legguards are great for tanks, the Valor Shoulders are pre-raid BiS, and the Chromatic Flight Breastplate from Gyth (Chromatic Carapace drop) is the best all-around chest piece you can get at this point of the game.
---
In no universe is this griefing. It's literally just game mechanics at work. Be in a raid where someone tags a civ and the civ dies, get a DK.
---
If you're serious about honor you should be nowhere near civs.
---
As a rogue, I feel attacked. 
---
You are right though
---
Come to Earthfury where there is so little horde alliance have to gank in horde capital cities for some HKs
---
&gt; but while leveling this is 100% false
---
It's not only false while leveling, it's false all the time.
---
He might top stats and healing meters by only throwing out HoTs in a raid, but the reason for that isn't HoTs being top notch efficient, the reason is MC boss-fights last 1-2 minutes only, giving room for playing mana-inefficient as long as you don't run OOM (+pots/runes) during the fight duration.
---
I was able convince my friends to level to 60, run dungeons over and over for pre-bis, and stay up late af to get raids done. But ive so far had 0 luck convincing them to engage in wpvp. Its utterly pointless to them, and whenever the idea gets brought up, we end up playing a different game.
---
Yeah thats what i though.
---
I used to use grid a few expansion back and I remember it beeing very customisable.   
---
However im really not that type of person who likes to sink hours in my UI and to completely honest i feel like i dont know how to setup this addon without screwing other things up...
---
But thanks a lot for your help, im going to make it work somehow, now that i know how to add these mana bars.
---
Dunno, wouldn't blame them. If the choice is between being the 20% and the 80% I will definitely pick the latter. Sure, you essentially get a PvE server experience, at least you're able to farm and quest in the open world and not spend 50+ minutes getting through BRM every time you want to get to MC/BRS/BRD.
---
Why are people fucking ridiculous? I hope they get a perma ban. Morons.
---
Please tell me everyone was screaming with joy in discord chat
---
Okay the slamming was an exaggeration. I’m British so when I say slam the desk I mean ‘shake my head disapprovingly’. 
---
Besides, by the time I get high enough level to be interesting to level 60s we will all have succumbed to the heat death of the universe.

---
Yikes those are some dog shit parses.
---
'Serious about PvP'... yeah. You're abusing game mechanics to grind honor. It has nothing to do with pvp. You're basically making people quit the game because the way horde apes are griefing in SG is making the game unplayable. Literally. But enjoy your empty servers and day long bg queues for the sake of reaching rank 10 in 6 months because you compete with a billion other horde cunts who rolled their faction to play the game on easy mode. But if you have no life and this is all the fun you have, enjoy.
---
I hope they don't just repeat and go for BC...
---
run through and res at the furthest point forward and keep doing that ... no durability damage in pvp
---
The names are green though
---
One binding first week of raiding, have yet to get the other
---
Technically the best and most efficient threat gen is spamming greater blessings on the most represented class.
---
Lack of cooldowns and mana issues on long fights are still a problem. No taunt is a problem on bosses that require tank switches, but there isn't that many of them.
---
If they are massive drop off from player with wPVP you wouldn't see them. So yeah seems a big deal to me.
---
Roll a rogue and distract people. So much potential for harmless trolling.
---
I havn't played retail for many years, and I think many other classic players are in the same boat in that regard.
---
Not the ones further in.
---
Yep warlocks, count the bandages you saved and give them to your favorite, nice druid.
---
I like to put a worthless curse on ppl as a lock. Dropping curse of tongues on a rogue or weakness on a priest and watch them run in fear expecting me to follow up lol. Harmless and brings me joy
---
Lasher farm is mainly about herbs and vendor greys. Without Herbalism it’s about 30g/h and with herb it’s 50g/h. You can also get lucky with random loot like Epics, Patterns and the trinket books. I’ve also had 2 epics over like 200 runs, but only one trinket book.
---
People in MC gear will breeze through the mobs in AV.
---
We're you able to take the great lift or did you have to go to stonetalon then desolace then feralas?
---
Get better at the game? The majority of honor farming right now involves mindlessly tab targeting people like bots. Theres very little skill involved in setting up roaming death squads and mowing down people who are questing. Ironically you're the one who got defensive over a simple comment that wasnt malicious in any way.
---
Only if you're horde though. Playing horde on a pvp server is as safe as playing on a pve server.
---
I saved about 4 decent twink items through out the leveling phase. I recently sold them all for about 25g ea to afford my epic mount.
---
People you've killed multiple times, stop giving honor regardless of level. Idk where you're even coming from with this.
---
Massive value in killing people who have just left combat
---
Like a rogue vanish if you kill straight after fan get max honor
---
Same with mages coming out of iceblock or hunters after feign death
---
Same on Herod horde. About 3-4g
---
Yep.
---
It makes sense that you'd only see it on the majority faction. The main benefit is that you're denying honor to others of your same faction. If there are 20 people camping a FP, that's 18 people that you don't have to share honor with.
---
It's a lot more difficult for the minority faction to camp a FP for very long, especially if you're in a group of 2 and there's no incentive for allied players to stick around.
---
Request trade.... &amp; yes I have done that before. 🥶
---
Barbershop I could live with but you should show the gear you are wearing.
---
I sadly just respecced to fury from arms last night, to facilitate raid dps.  I will miss mortal strike, and the 5% stun from maces in the spec I was using.  (which is so unbelievably clutch sometimes).  Once I get raid geared, might have to go back to arms, but fury PvP in battlegrounds will be fine enough I guess.  Doing 2h fury, as I like the big critz.
---
Arms is super helpful, but honestly, mortal strike's effect on healing doesn't do much to help against mages,  PVP trinket can help, but honestly, 1v1 vs mages is the worst matchup for warrior.  It will take them making mistakes for you to win.
---
Faster than the wow ticket system? Do you own a pigeon?
---
IMHO 20 hours a week is casual by WoW standards
---
Monday-Friday 2 hours a day = 10 hours.
---
Saturday and Sunday 5 hours = 10 hours.
---
Nothing crazy.
---
Fastest? Probably DM E or DM N, both of those are quick, although travel time can be annoying. However, for most useful, I'd say probably LBRS. 
---
You'll want to run LBRS to start the quest for Voone's Vice Grips, and the bows from there are BiS, along with the bow from DM E, so it really comes down to which one you can find first. There's an amazing necklace from Voone (Talisman of Evasion) that I used until I got Onyxia's necklace, and the experience in LBRS is insane for a non-60. It can be a little slow with an inexperienced group though, so bring someone who knows how to do the jumps to skip half the dungeon.
---
Yeah but to the same extent? Like 15 corpseruns to BRD?
---
You asked about children, but not employment.
---
I’m horde on rattlegore also! I’m always seeing plenty of ally fighting in the open world. Maybe I really can’t tell being horde but it doesn’t seem one sided to me.
---
Kill squads WERE an issue before Honor. Where the hell have you been these last months?!
---
Agreed. Then I can see when people have it and avoid killing them until it wears off :)

As much as most people would groan to see the trinket drop, I’d kill to use it on my tank in 5 mans. There’s a lot of return damage when hit in classic which helps aoe tanking quite a bit.

No, I'd rather spend an inordinate amount of time pissing and moaning rather than helping or doing anything constructive

Spirit gives me a better mana pool?
---
Create an indicator of type "bar" and assign the "power" status to it. You can check the class color in the status color tab as well. Not sure why it isn't already created for you out of the box, but it's not too hard to set up.
---
It's crazy how you've managed to get on reddit without first learning to read.
---
Its not the tactics of the boss, its the preparation and organisation. Which he said.
---
*for PvP servers
---
I agree. It will eventually be Don Julio's and Quickstrike. However that wasn't his question
---
The same mechanics apply.  Typically though on lower pop realms there is more time to prepare multiple scarab Lord's than on high pop realms as it's easier to discuss the opening ceremony with fewer guilds assuming multiple groups are capable of clearing BWL expeediantly.
---
Time of donations is the only Caveat to this, as lower pop realms will inevitably take longer to fulfill the donation schedule.  Due to this factor it's likely the gates open later than other servers.
---
&gt; The massive population cap on each server and unbalanced factions ratios
---
First part is true, massive population leads to this kind of behaviour. Unbalanced factions only means that you're always on the receiving side, on sulfuron (53/47), the faction are just switching side doing that, thorium will most likely be horde while burning stepps is likely to be alliance, but sometimes you end up in the halt crawling with ally killing the flying master. 
---
The system favours ganking in overwhelming numbers rather than equilibrate fight, so that what it leads to
---
It never ceases to amaze me the mental gymnastics people come up with to push "smart gameplay mechanics"
---
Risky business posting this on reddit without blurring your name. I believe the “leader resetting while party is offline inside” is considered an exploit and you can get banned for it. I know other people have been.
---
Grats on the loot :)
---
Yes they are its not because you don't, that 0 alliance are doing it.
---
I don't gank lowbie but this is a thing on both side
---
F
---
How are they cheap? 8-10g each on my server.
---
I might be wrong, but I don't recall any yes/no dialog.
---
must not be anyone here from Incendius where alliance constantly ganks/camps and horde just runs away
---
“LFM Strat 2 DPS+Tank+Heals then G2G.  Orbs and Mount reserved.”

---
Azuresong mageblade to a fresh 60?
---
You pug it or does your guild actually allow free rolls instead of DKP or loot council?
---
As a ret paladin I answered a post for a warrior looking for DPS for UD Strat.  He asked if needed gear, I said no, just rep, then he told me to come to SW so he could inspect my gear before inviting me, I lol'd and stopped talking to him.
---
Funny thing was this was late night and about a half hour later he messaged me begging to join because he couldn't find anyone else.  Turns out he was only concerned about the unforgiven mask and I have lionheart.
---
I agree 100%, but nobody is going to invite you to their UBRS group as a 58 or 59 because they usually have a huge selection of players to choose from.  The only exception may be a healer.  DPS is a dime a dozen and tanks - as you said - should be 60.
---
Yeah, but tbh ally owns BRM for like 80% of the day. Horde on the server is kind of a joke, but I didn't think they'd resort to this kinda stuff personally. Did hear rumours about people trading kills though.        
---
Also yeah it is more difficult but it's happened so many times I've stopped questioning it. But at the same time I haven't seen people trying to camp a fp as a small group with a zerg doing the same
---
You mean 31/20/0
---
It is doable for sure, but a lot of elitists will dismiss you simply due to level. If you are thick skinned and don't mind being blamed for any problems that come up, go ahead.
---
Depends I was new to the game and I couldn’t and I was trying lol but it was during the release on the most packed server maybe tht was a factor
---
Ah okay makes much more sense thank you!
---
Doesnt seem that unfair to me though, other players arent able to attack the MCd target correct? So they technically arent contributing to the kill, seems basically the exact same as tagging any regular mob. Whoever hits it first gets the XP and loot, this isnt much different no?
---
Planetside has done so, but the game gets equally laggy when that happens.
---
Is it the guy from Once Upon a Time?
---
A lot of UI mods can do it, but you can also get LeatrixPlus which has a setting for that as well as other QoL options.
---
These things have been true for me. I’m a bit of a hardass when I tank but I know what the grind is like, I don’t mind helping people at all.
---
But huntards hit the nickname for a reason
---
Aslo Finkles Lava Dredger is pretty dreadful for an enhancer. It's a defensive caster weapon (pretty good for pvp for druids in this phase, but not much else)

---
I dunno, but I dinged level 47 this weekend.

Got me giggling.

Also, if you're that British and need more play time, just skip the daily two hours in pubs and drink your beer during Instances!
---
Now I know why a guy in chat was asking for a group for him and his alt.
---
this is obtainable by getting rank 11
---
Yes, you are right. In my "investigation" i am focussing on the effect of having children and what influence that has on your progress.  
---
I agree that employment would play an equal if not bigger factor, but alas, it was not included, and now i have gotten over a thousand responses, so changing/adding a question would mess with the data.

That moment when a war game isn’t designed for war
---
It takes at least 2 raid lockouts to do the quest, so slightly more than 7 days.  The gong does not appear until 120 hours(5 days) after the war effort completes.  On private servers it would typically take about 4 weeks for the war effort to complete, so about a month between the time that patch 1.9 went live and the AQ gates opened.
---
Is this smolderweb
---
Tier items for warriors are notoriously bad. Not 1 of the tier pieces is BiS for PvP
---
in 8 weeks we had 1 Brutality Blade, 0 Bloodfang hats, 2 bloodfang pants, 2 Vis'kags, 2 Core Hound Tooths. 4 Nightstalker belts, but 0 bracers :D
---
Lesser Invisibility potions.  Fight him until the cave opens, then there is a little square ledge just to the right of the cave opening that you can evade reset them.  Spam invis pot so you invis the second you drop combat and once imps reset you just walk into cave and mine.  Don't need to clear any trash or kill boss.  20s a piece for the potions is worth the time saved.
---
Join or create a quest run.  The first half of BRD has tons of quests to complete.
---
So, I'm a warrior tank, and a raid leader of a group that's been farming MC/Ony for several weeks, and I'll be honest, I feel like I can be a bit of an ass (or a lot of an ass) at times. I feel it has to do with my impatience over repeat mistakes. Ok, you accidentally multi-shot and aggro'd another group, and we wiped, fine, shit happens, be more careful. But when it happens twice, thrice, etc., I can get real mean.
---
Is this "elitist" attitude what you're referring to when you say that members of top raiding guilds are "toxic"? Or is there something else you're referring to?
---
I’ve been thinking about doing that to run through BRM a little faster to get through the horde

Group of 8-10 rl friends looking for smaller guild to join/merge with on Fairbanks to do 8PM server raids.
---
We're a group of friends who met during/played in Vanilla together and raided extensively through Cata.  We're newishly 60 on Fairbanks and looking to join up with another smaller guild to raid throughout Classic.  We have a nice mix of classes.  Best raid times for us are 8PM Pacific, but nights are flexible.  The only things we're looking for are guaranteed raid spots to start and an officer position or two.  Interested?  Let me know and let's get on discord to see if there's a fit.
---
This is **exactly** the answer I was looking for. I was worried that the gong would go live at the same time as the war effort and it would literally just be a race for the first person to hit the gong. Much appreciated!

Yes.  And the US hasn't had a formal declaration of war since 1942.

---
Please explain how this is any different than a Mage/Rogue/Druid using CC and simply waiting for the honorless buff to wear off.
---
In answer to your questions.
---
Yes and we did. Though 5 -  10 people that were up for going to the area we were heading to made zero diff when there is 40+ horde waiting.
---
I can't really change area when i am heading to UBRS, or MC etc. Sort of in one place buddy. 
---
Its not a few bad days, It's every day since the honour update dropped. It probably has half to do with that due to work etc the time i can play is peak time and the horde just flat out outnumber alliance in the vast majority of cases.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60&amp;realm=4476_Gehennas lvl 60 characters logged during the last 7 days. The question is why alliance doesn't fight back if they actually had the numbers. Are they just chilling in IF?
---
I noticed alliance has a funny way to troll everyone by claiming their whines being one-sided and ganking wouldn't happen the other way round.
---
Faction imbalance has nothing to do with this, people being dicks on the internet for self-approvement is the cause.
---
I'm not. I'm on a PvE server.
---
What can I farm to get golds as a solo level 60 Warrior (blacksmith /mining)? I have dungeon level gears and mostly playing 2 hands since my server is pvp, and the 60% mount is not helping

It spices up things if you use NS to insta-root.

Didn't knew the doors would open anyway regardless of the donations.

I wish more people understood that. The amount of harassment I get for not bluffing people with that is ridiculous.

MC was not tuned around 40 people in full pre-bis, using flasks, pre-potting Greater X Resistance Potions although they are available.

You dont play hemo with daggers, thats just mediocre.

His build looks like Sealed Fate Hemo though, that seems just weird to me but maybe I'm just too closeminded.

---
It's interesting. I play a warrior, and you are right in a way. Now, I'm not the nicest guy out there, just as my raid team, but I do try to be polite and respectful to people I don't know.
---
But anyways, I do find myself being nicer to other warriors, and they in turn to me. I feel it has to do with how painful it was to level a warrior, and that whole "comraderie through hardship" thing.
---
Google DM East Jump Run Solo Warlock, do the same thing he does
---
No problem bud,  are you trying for Scarab Lord?
---
This isnt 15 years ago. People know everything, theres more of them, and we know how good pvp rewards are. You elected to play a walking resource node on a pvp server as soon as p2 launched and you knew in advance this would be the case.
---
 Lok Tar Ogar, Victory or Death. 
---
Not sure why anyone would ever expect to take a fair fight when the unfair kind are safer and more profitable. It's not like pve has a lack of pvp right now, plenty walking around flagged. TM vs SS almost always busy, and Capital cities semi frequently see fights

Kill it!

It's definitely hard at first but once you've done it a few times it becomes second nature.

I think a better way of framing it is that even as the favored faction the system can still be really awful, and a lot of players are making it awful for others. 
---
Corpse/graveyard camping is a terrible design decision, and honor decay is clearly an ineffective deterrent. 
---
For low zones it’s less about skirmishes and more “is there a max level jerk in the zone of opposing faction? Y/N?”  Faction imbalance and overall population matter.
---
I hear this excuse constantly, but user reports and investigation won't be trumped by these bots. Let them think something got them caught when it was just user reports.
---
First proper war starts in BFA. Before that, we just like to kill each other
---
I made it. Turns out you have to be on the boss’ aggrolist so quest doesnt fail. I tagged and waited for the father to show up and died. Didnt release until boss was dead and delivered quest
---
This is Vanilla "behind the back talking" right here :) wholesome as fuck :D
---
That makes sense. A straight out lootban is a bit harsh tho as the guy above you suggested. The rogue can at least get the scraps :p
---
In for later
---
How does this happen? Which skills and bombs is he using?
---
Lol and you need to get better to reach 100k+ ?
---
Not even close, all you gotta do is forget that you have a life and dive into the game 10+ hrs a day. Welcome to classic when time played &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; skill.
---
One of my guild's rogue is #17 and just barely sleeps. So much skill aww.
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
Also Catseye Ultra Goggles (and Catseye Elixir)
---
Really? Someone else saying it has rare mob spawns and paths
---
On Mograine, which is supposedly even, it's just to throw a coin before logging on, either you die and need to pick up your corpse while making it out of gadget, or you don't die and the opposing faction is being mass harassed. It feels like every time I log on it's horde, every time I log off it's alliance.
---
It isn't hard mechanically but in coordination. People trivialize it because once you understand it as a raid, it is rinse and repeat. But until then it can be aggravating for groups. It is also a big gear/dps check so if the raid isn't well equipped it can go poorly
---
I have found that if I assume the DPS are brainless meter chasers, I am never disappointed.  I'm sure plenty of Mages could kite a pack for days, but I've seen enough fuck it up and wipe the party that I'd rather just avoid the situation entirely.  Risk averse as fuck.
---
It wasn't 20/80 until they left. Skeram alliance population was literally cut in half by people transferring off BEFORE phase 2. Complaining about being ganked while leveling to 60. Well no shit, it's a PvP server.  I know some left due to queues and I understand. My original guild, however, left when there was no queue. Just people who belong on a PvE server.
---
Getting 40 people to do the 3 mechanics is the hardest mechanic.
---
I'm only playing the 19 bracket, wowhead has a great guide for that bracket
---
Alliance tends to have an average of 1 more hunter over horde. Presumably because hunters dont benefit from WF and also bring a dps buff for the melee groups filling a somewhat similar niche
---
That kind of makes you the entitled douche rather than the warrior though.
---
Well no wonder you cant vanish..you're supposed to be using flash powder you casual
---
In theory, yes, but you're wrong.  You still take a ton of damage from so many mobs.   I'm a 60 warrior with a 60 druid healer and I have to split the courtyard in two sections for pulls and do the inner cathedral in 2-3 pulls.  I tried to 1 pull the inner cathedral and the damage output just slowly drained the druid's mana and we died.  In addition there are healers which extend the fight quite a bit.  If you could get 2 60 carries tank/healer with 3 mages, maybe it's possible, to do cathedral in 1 pull.
---
The agi to wep enchants arent in game yet. +int is best for ferals and hunters just for some extra mana
---
My experience has been if I'm grouping with a mage to do a dungeon, they happily give their water for free, and will give 1 (sometimes 2 if asked) portals for free without even having to be asked.
---
But those same mages will stand in IF and broadcast selling their services. I don't have a problem with them doing it, it's people's choice to pay for it or not, but if you've never been charged for food/water or a portal, than my guess is that you've never asked for these things outside of a group for a dungeon.
---
Welcome to the tank life. Keep stuff off th healer and cross fingers the dps know how to kite and focus proper targets.    Having keybinds that let you mark targets fast can help smooth this out but there’s no real way of dealing with tunnel vision dps pugs.   As a tank i raise my glass and wish you all the best !
---
I thought this whole thread was /u/commahorror and his alt accounts for a second there
---
Exactly! Salv is a blessing (pun intended) for bursty DPS bois and gals.
---
Well i noticed his bags....
---
also stratholme and naxxramas
---
No he doesn't, because he's not even there.
---
A rogue rolled need on Typhoon for Azuregos drop. He's currently blacklisted throughout the server.
---
&gt; Should I grind dungeons instead? (Are they worth more XP/hour than solo questing TN?)
---
If you have dungeons quest it might be.  
---
Id prefer doing a dungeon a couple of times, until i get some decent loot from it, so it gives me a boost during the leveling  
---
&gt;What level can I start tanking Scarlet Monastery Graveyard?
---
if i remember correctly the finall boss is 34, so it should be easy doable on level 32 (?) 
---
What are the most economically viable Enchantments I can get for my gear if I'll be replacing them?
---
Please dont waste money on that, or else you wont be able to afford your mount @lvl40 - unless you are a enchanter yourself, go for fiery weapon  
---
&gt;What Elixirs and buffs should I be after to help the process?
---
Please dont waste money on that, or else you wont be able to afford your mount @lvl40 - unless you are a alchemist yourself, go for defense potion, restoration potion, health elixir, agility , like all the stats help, but you might consider selling the potions on Action Haus, to get gold for your mount

Tier 1 gloves are also pretty sick giving good str/Stam + 1 hit. It’s not a bad item to have for pvp
---
Dude wtf is with that, Its like "Sorry I tried to heal you, but idk what you want me to do though cuz you ran right in there..."
---
Watch out you'll trigger their victim complex.
---
28 yo vanilla player, raided through mythic on the last 3 xpacs, returning after a long break. Looking for a pvp guild. On whitemane-pvp NA rn, leveling a spriest only 14 rn. Hoping to find guild on the server currently but I’m low enough I’m ok starting over.
---
Thankfully I’m on an allí dominated server so good riddance 75/25 alliance. They should instantly queue for BG then
---
Oh interesting. So it’s random and you’re essentially just lowering the odds of your beneficial buff being removed. Good info. Thank you!
---
Yeah like some have said, lasher farms are very efficient and can be solo'd as a holy priest. Definitely beneficial to have herb. You HAVE to have 6k mana minimum. You can respec 31/20/0 for the extra 10% mana plus PI but I personally didn't respec Disc until I had almost +500 healing. Didn't want to sacrifice my healing abilities purely for farming but once you've reach +500 healing it's recommended to go 31/20/0 anyways so it works out.
---
Possible for you to spec into fury prot for a while, tank and host UBRS rend runs and reserve one piece of dal rends set at a time? Instead of paying 500g plus/minus.
---
I was lucky enough to get my full dal rends set as a fury warrior, but I understand your frustration. I still don't think grinding dal rends set is annoying enough to pay 500g for anything.
---
That's one of the most imbalanced servers lol and only a fool would consider a crowd versus one dude pvp.
---
That's dope dude congrats!
---
Well, it's not like they designed it this way with 15 years of foresight. PVP on this scale was never a problem in vanilla.
---
My mouse has 12 buttons which I just use 1-0 and MB4 and MB5, they're all easily in reach so while sure I can't do shift-0 with only my left hand, I don't need to let go off my mouse so it's not a problem. OP might be doing something similar.
---
Ohh, I did that multiple times already, and it's amazing how they are able to mobilize like ten people to downvote within a minute, but are unable to call ten friends to stomp the four hordes camping their flight path. Complaining for random reasons takes way less work :)
---
Yeah engineering is definitely not cheap. I’ve kind of put it off for now until I get my mount. I definitely wasted some money on gear at the ah early on... whoops
---
No one plays pally as a twink it's the weakest and good luck Hojing a hunter my dude!
---
It's ironic, but when we had Finkle's Dredger drop last week, nobody was interested in it, and we thought about disenchanting it, but large brilliant shards sell for 3g a piece on my server (so 6g from the dredger), versus 13g55s you get from vendoring it. So we instead decided to /roll it off to a lucky someone and have them vendor it.
---
As a level 58 gnome arms warrior, what dungeons can I do as DPS and as Tank and what are the best ones to level ? Thanks!
---
My my
---
Curse forged website iirc, either that or Willitclassic website
---
well when you work and dont have the time to sit here and grind levels everyday, it takes a very long time to level. i dont have the time to do so i just want to enjoy the game and not spend the first few months grinding 2 times over, or looking for a group in a dead server
---
As a (former) healer myself, I promise to not waste healer mana. If I have a HoT, I will lifetap until it fades so every tick is used. Additionally, please don't panic to heal me unless we're in combat and the tank is incapacitated. If I die, it's my fault.
---
Yeah, saw him a week later in an mc pug and he wasn't even wearing it.
---
Stratholme is very good for leveling
---
This is most definitely generalizing based on your own experiences. You cannot say there is a definite pattern based on solely on interactions you’ve had. In my experience I’ve had more interactions with toxic warriors and priests and some mages. But I’ve also had great interactions with all 3 of those classes. I think some people that play the game are just toxic no matter what class they choose to play and I don’t think toxicity correlates with class choice at all.
---
That what i was thinking about the start of classic i dont mind blizzard fail at it, its still a win for future privat servers with the new data gathered
---
Tihihi, I like that one :D
---
Well priest can mind control before the honorless target runs out and in this way secure every single full honor on every player. And with the honor system it's not just who tags first, but who deals most damage. That part you are completely circumventing with this "trick".
---
It’s feels horde favoured to me.
---
just make sure you use rank 1
---
I’ve never heard about that tactic with GBoK! That really works? I tanked a little bit in SM on my pally but then switched back to ret for PvP with the new patch, but hope to get back into tanking for 50-60 range. This was some great advice!
---
Almost like all the retail streamer fanbois on ally quit playing the game. Probably couldn't handle the grind or was too slow paced for them.
---
Exactly this.
---
Not surprised, RP servers are different.. Even as a someone who didn't really roleplay, I remember fondly my time there. There was none for my region this time around, but I would have picked one given the choice.
---
You can do it without an addon
---
Ive been making good money farming veins in duskwood and upper STV. Been doing it level my blacksmithing ( so much iron) My route starts at spider cave east of Darkshire then heads south around the edge, through the worgen to the ogres. The heads north and goes around central mountain circle. After that head to STV, check kurzan areas-venture co- then cross river and look around raptors and tigers and finish up at hemmingways. Hearth to stormwind to smelt
---
 Rinse repeat, about an hour worth of farming.
---
Lot of unnecessary info, but this route ive found has a plethera of copper, tin, and iron. As well as some silver and gold. So I mine everything. Bronze bars are about a 1g a stack, coarse stone 3g a stack, iron 2g a stack. Heavy stone 1.5g a stack. So its around 10-15g per trip if youre lucky. Ive been using this income to supplement my iron and mithril purchases (pally so no mount requirenents). Want that BS trinket.
---
At this level, think its a decent time/gold farm.
---
Wich instances?
---
Oh I do want changes, WoW Vanilla/Classic has a lot of flaws when we talk about gameplay, it only rewards playtime not skill.
---
IMO most of the "top" players are trash, they just compensate it with stuff due to play time.
---
Anyway I rolled on PvE server this time to avoid no-lifers, community is so much better, and we can actually play the game outside of dungeons !
---
I just seen the mana regen and stats as a resto shammy and panicked and stuck in a low DKP bid....wasnt til about 10mins after the raid I realised I needed to spec into enh to get 2H option. So quickly traded it back. 
---
Noob mistake....been a while since I played...haha
---
Unfortunately I think the kids are off this week for Thanksgiving break.  Either that or the horde have no jobs.
---
Yup happened to me a few weeks ago. Not shit you can do about it besides being more careful with who's your group leader and not fighting close to the entrance.
---
I run a 30/0/21 seal fate hemo build in my raid group.  As a human I need to have 7% hit + racial to be at a comfortable place.   In the MC tier getting enough crit is tough.  But I am consistently in the top 1/4 of my raids dps.   If I can get into the feral druids group and have songflower my DPS skyrockets.
---
in vanilla i had a mage i played till about 30ish, a warlock powereleveld to 40, and druid poweerleveled to 50. didnt have the time with two brothers to play alot so i had to pay for the services. but i did do lots of quests and instances. so getting back to that type of community and meetings strangers has been awesome again. and ofc just wpvp allll the time. 
---
on private servers it was x12 experience. so the leveling aspect was gone however I got to finally raid for years MC/BWL/ZG/aq20. got rank 11 in PVP and exhaulted with WSG and AV. played the server for about 3 years.
---
so in my mind i have done everything I have really ever wanted to do in vanilla/classic. EXCEPT level to 60. i have been loving it so far. i find getting a little bored at the end of instance level range. its not THAT bad and before u know it u have a new isntance to do. i think the SM part is my least favorite. like u run to the same zone. same building. the last 10 SM cath runs would have been so hard if not for AOE mage runs. thats something thats new to me as well. no idea these ZF gy runs were even possible. 
---
either way. games awesome. always has been always will be. i hope they never take the servers down, because there is so much to do this game. and 90% of i have done it as a mage, and would love to do more with another class. im gunna try and make a lvl 19 twink as well this time around.
---
that website says kromcrush and fairbanks is 50/50 and that aint true at all
---
Not sure how I can prove it to you, but it is true. I was in the hospital for about a week, but until that happened I was logging on almost every hour to find jed, get a group, and try to get a run in. You can think it's made up all you want, but it isn't. Took me near 40 runs to get bone slicing hatchet while I got cape in my first run.
---
Alliance on Herod here and it feels incredibly unbalanced for us. Even though the census says the pop is 2:1 it feels worse for us bc a lot of people have quit or aren’t willing to leave the major cities. And even in our major cities, we are getting constantly ganked by different groups of rogues. It’s so fucking lame
---
How many a times ive died with 34 energy and 4-5 combopoints on a dude, rogue life can be tough fellas
---
Shoutout to that rogue killing Gamon so his poor lowbie brothers can get their daggers.
---
Yeah that seems to be the general consensus, I’m definitely still focused on lvling. My partner and I are lvling together though so he doesn’t like me to get too far ahead, so when he’s at work I just focus on making gold, ya know? In other words.. I have no life and can waste 10 hours on farming haha
---
I was the same, I didnt want to bid on it....but did for 1 DKP :D
---
Then realised I had to spec into enh to use it. so traded it back. 
---
Noob mistake :D
---
I don't think Blizzard should care what someone does for a living.
---
What spyglass are you talking about? Only one I've found just zooms in your camera.
---
The other day I found him dead in the middle of desolace lol
---
try /r/woweconomy
---
Maybe dude has done 100 rend runs and has lost it every time, you don’t know his situation.
---
You can dps all of them 
---
You can tank everything but ubrs and I'd be a little concerned in strat undead but if you're good you should be ok.
---
Yeah, most warrior tanks have not been assholes, just entitled, and i tried to hint at it is somewhat justified. Especially if they're good, and honestly it must be a hard line to walk because on one hand if you're an ass... well, you're an ass, but if you're too nice you will basically get taken advantage off
---
That's dumb , mp5 for mage is a waste
---
A few?
---
I was looking forward to BGs, but they're coming way too soon IMO. I wish they'd spread the phases out more, all it's going to do is fracture the playerbase and make it so that there are less people available in the pool for dungeons and other activities. Phases 2 and 3 (2.5 since it's just BGs?) are way too soon and I wish they'd slow the fuck down and let us enjoy what's out there.
---
I keep a few linen bandages around just to apply the debuff to my friends so they have to wait longer to heal. I only do this to friend I know in real life. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't fly for people who don't actually know me.
---
Really appreciate the tips - I'm hopeful that my guild will be there to help me out too, 42,000 of the fragments is no joke. Nonetheless I think I'm in it with a decent shot. My guild has had MC and Onyxia on farm for months already, there are people online 24 hours a day and (ultimately) they have respect for me because I spend countless hours organising raids, researching tactics and helping people with anything and everything they need. I'm hopeful that the favor will one day come round to me, but it all depends on how willing my guildies are to help.
---
From what I can tell reading elsewhere, for me to realistically be able to do this, I'd need to make sure we do BWL the day that the quest is available (and save our lockout for it), then be onto the next part of the BWL questchain by the following week. That also averages a total of 3000 fragments a day. Not easily achieved but from what I understand, it's also possible in a group of 5 to comfortably achieve 50 Fragments per hour. With 3 groups of 5 on farm, it would take 280 total hours to farm these if I'm not mistaken.
---
Could you let me know if these figures make sense to you? Are these details realistic, or am I being optimistic? Thanks so much once again.
---
That was possibly the most arrogant shit I've ever seen from a gamer. And there's been a lot.
---
19 bracket for me. Not yet thought about leveling my twink, but I may do so soon.
---
thats not the same as having the icons on the actionbar
---
God damn the sound editing is awful.
---
It's the bakers they should be concerned about
---
I helped my guildies farm strath live last week and I remember feeling so good when the tank reacted to an elite mob just getting deleted due to two big crits of mine :) I love these kinds of interactions
---
&gt;my guess is that you've never asked for these things outside of a group for a dungeon.
---
Swing and a miss. You just don't ask the ones spamming for money for their services. Be polite and tip and you'll never run out of free water and ports.
---
It's almost like wow subreddits love to circlejerk about stuff that doesn't happen.
---
My guildies that have been doing this on pservers....
---
To be honest, I wont twink for a long time.  AV grind for exalted for PVE items...
---
Then finish leveling alts...
---
Same.  I have an aoe tank set and that trinket is the main set piece.
---
Horde always gathers in Kargath before going into BRM. 3/4 of them are afk which usually led to alliance launching invi saper charge quite frequently on them in this area. When the raids are full they'll go into BRM.
---
I'm not sure why they gather there while thorium's halt is usually a lot safer and closer due to the constant ganking squads
---
If I'm solo against a rogue I know is around I wouldn't be dumb enough to bring out my felhunter. Keep my succubus out and just try to bait you into opening on me is the right strategy. Haven't lost to a solo rogue yet, but I haven't been engaged by a good one either.
---
Go to a private server then..... if you can find one. Blizzard shut them all down with a DMCA you dumbass. You are like the third person in 5 minutes to say this. 
---
Set up your own and blizzard will nuke you with lawsuits, China can't even have knock off games because China likes blizzard too. 
---
Why do I have to enjoy a video game that so many stupid people play.....
---
Yeah that's just not true at all
---
I’ve been farming it from level 55, just get 6K MP and go for it
---
I understand what you mean. I’ll be honest I don’t know all the correct terms, I’ve just seen it called farming so maybe that wasn’t the correct way to word it. I’m still focused on leveling and I see already that quests are worth more than before. I just want to get my mount as soon as possible like everyone else I’m sure :p
---
Is there an add-on for Hunters (or any ranged) that will show my distance from my target?
---
Yet we all have hand holding add-ons because it's so easy.
---
Dude I find the engagement fun on when youre out in the middle of nowhere and its like 1v2 or 2v2 etc or 5v5. I dont even mind the odd dying, thats not lame. But when it takes you 20 mins to run from Kargath to BRD its demoralizing. Theres no sixties on my server PvPing as horde it seems. Its just people running away and dying and it makes you almost wanna just logout. This video is after ten mins of corpse running from Kargath to the BRM entrance or whatever you wanna call it, i revive at 1 min about but it still takes till 12 mins in for me to get to the instance. [Wooo](https://youtu.be/oeQpDnERZe8)
---
\*Majordomo
---
STV coast north west of the central horde town in the floating wreckages. Higher level cloth on the same coast southern areas.
---
Ah yes I've checked it out, it seems pretty comprehensive otherwise but the item choices list seems to be set in stone without any comments whatsoever. It makes me wonder since they have Horde only Weapon for Ally Hunter in list and there's no comments about how some things like Little Timmy's Peashooter lines up vs Venomstrike with Dwarf's +gun skill etc.
---
&gt; Are people just not aware they exists ? There are two different version one for low and one for higher levels. They are relatively cheap to buy or you could even just roll an alt with alchemey to feed yourself as well also giving you the added advatage of the catalogue of other helpfull pots.
---
Many people just consider it easier to cry in online forums instead of using the same amount of time to research. Also it's super funny that Alliance players actually thing only Alliance is getting ganked ever.
---
Buddy you can't use invis pots in combat -- you can the cloak. It can be used to reset aggro in pve or even drop combat and swap a 3rd trinket in single pvp fight, not to mention just getting away. Cloak for drop then invis pots, and you're totally gone.
---
Also lesser invis pots cost 1.5g/ea on my server.
---
I don't know the butchers look shifty.  I don't trust them.
---
The way census currently samples data doesn't seem at all reliable. Just a week ago the same link showed something like a 13/87 distribution for some reason which is obviously not at all correct.
---
No I mean 0/20/31, it's what every Mage who's going for R14 is playing right now.
---
BRD is funny.  The first boss is probably different depending on who you ask.
---
You know server transfers existed in vanilla right?
---
That still feels a lot faster than i would've imagined.
---
Hi, gonna sound like an asshole with this question.
---
Does anyone else hate losing gear to a memespec?
---
I guess Ret isn't a meme spec entirely as it brings some value? But man good lord do I fucking hate losing gear to them.
---
I lost the head of ony to one the other day and just thought, "man even in my worst gear I will probably be able to still slash you on the dps charts."
---
Like we got one in our guild and he's super geared but barely does more damage than our tanks, like he struggles to do so. I don't care, we're clearing content (he's also a really good guy and funny) and everyone's getting some gear but man I get frustrated anytime I see him roll. 
---
That's my unpopular question/opinion I guess, just wondering if anyone else feels the same?
---
While I agree that the problem needs addressing, I'm confused by that link at the bottom from Korea - that guy's very clearly and obviously lagging to shit and so is everyone around him - did you link the wrong clip?
---
there is this level ~18 quest is Darkshore where you get a cloak that turns you invisible on use for 5 minutes. One time only but you can simply abandon and retake the quest and get a new one.
---
Meh, WPvP will go back to p1 levels once BGs are out and then playing on a PvE server is going to be pretty lame.
---
Why are you so scared of losing your population advantage? Scared to death of a fair fight?
---
I run a 30/0/21 seal fate hemo build in my raid group.  As a human I need to have 7% hit + racial to be at a comfortable place.   In the MC tier getting enough crit is tough.  But I am consistently in the top 1/4 of my raids dps.   If I can get into the feral druids group and have songflower my DPS skyrockets.  This build is very gear dependent.
---
Why use one over the other and not both? Double invisibly is rad.
---
Joke's on you, Horde don't have girls.
---
Generally speaking, higher level zones have higher level fish. There's a multitude of guides on the subject.
---
Go to a private server then..... if you can find one. Blizzard shut them all down with a DMCA you dumbass lol. You are like the fourth now, person in 5 minutes to say this *in this thread alone*. 
---
Set up your own private server and blizzard will nuke you with lawsuits, China can't even have a knock off WoW because China likes blizzard too. 
---
You’re right, or anyone who wants to do a professional degree for that matter
---
Also Catseye Elixirs
---
Im also alliance on flamelash . There are on almost every boot 20+ man raids to **** you so yeh u cant do shit atm
---
Some people farming air elementals, but the earth ones are left alone most of the time, atleast on my server. They give good exp and some loot. I just grinded them for exp and to avoid getting ganked every 10 minutes.
---
Man you play with some bad locks. Warlocks are amazing in 5man content so long as they are any one of the 3 Ruin specs. I feel SM and MD are better than DS in a 5man though.
---
Especially since pally will have to drink anyway, so what good is Wisdom in the end tbh?
---
That's normal. I also stopped around 50 and leveled Priest to 20+  
---
But then I heard that one of top guilds are looking for Resto Druids, and this motivated me to finish leveling, do all attunments, gather healing gear, etc.  
---
I think problem was that I didn't have a goal. Now I'm raiding, have almost all gear from dungeons and some piece from raids it's becoming boring again)
---
If you're level 30 that means you're barely playing at all. Why do you even care what everyone else is doing if you're not really even playing?
---
A "few" months ????
---
Too bad it was a nice comment behind your back,  otherwise that unarmed skill increase might have been justified a little differently!
---
It is!
---
Badlands is good, was there yesterday after a couple people said that and I had pretty good luck. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
Probably atlas loot
---
Lol are you new here? Classic requires you to log in one day a week for a raid and then you can remain offline until the next raid.....
---
Classic is meant to be casual, not just from EQ/Ultima but from Retail as well. No daily quests = play and do whatever you want when you want..... I for one am not 60 yet. 57 hunter checking in. I took my time leveling, doing quest that were below my level just to experience different zones I never went to 15 years ago... leveled up my professions, help out lower level guildies ... by your definition I shouldn’t be playing the game anymore cuz I didn’t rush to 60 ASAP. Seriously get a life dude, plenty of people aren’t 60 and that’s fine since classic is so casual friendly. 
---
The problem is 100% blizzard catering to the streamers and no lifers... exactly what they did before to ruin the game. Honor should have been released with BG... and could have easily waited until dec/Jan... 
---
You’re toxic attitude doesn’t do anything than make you sound like that fat PoS rogue in South Park. If that’s how you want to portray yourself then by all means continue to be a toxic elitist determining how people are supposed to play a video game just realize you’re coming across as a moron and no one will take you seriously
---
Sader... really? Was it too much work typing three more letters? Might just be me, but I find the trend of cutting words short, even those who are short to begin with incredibly annoying.
---
It doesnt matter, only the number of "catch" is important for your skill level. Fishing low or high level fish- With or without lures is not important.
---
City standers are obviously going to be the geared ones, therefore the “so many” that you are seeing. Rest are out doing literally nothing productive.
---
Chill
---
Hmm something ain’t right about that site. The whole thing just yells fishy.
---
Low effort post. May as well have just stolen the whole movie at this point.
---
I've been slowly working on my Dwarf Hunter, got some gear in bank and he's level 10. Need to decide if I go for 19 or 29. Gear prices have been spiking a lot, but it also seems lot of people saved the items to sell from leveling so maybe there's enough of them to keep prices at reasonable levels for a while.
---
It is! I love the guild.
---
&gt; retadins
---
I read that as retardins. Help! I don't want to turn into one of those people with no patience for non-optimal stuff.
---
I’m so ready for 30 minute queues
---
According to estimations Kromcrush should be 40/60.
---
Seen this suggested a couple times, never thought of going solo in sm but it sounds like it might be worth a shot. Thanks!
---
noone is using flask for MC unless speedrunning (well except that one mage in our guild who did it just for fun one time)
---
That's such a bad answer I reckon that makes you an entitled douche.
---
Deadmines I presume.
---
The tank doesn't need to be geared for that. There's nothing there for a tank. All you need is to run it once for the Tirion quest chain.
---
I exclusively tank living for guildies. There's no reason for a tank to join a pug there as there is no tank loot.
---
Atlas loot doesnd add it foe shift inspect though
---
Or maybe he raid logs and hasn't done more than 3 UBRS, you don't know his situation.
---
Yeah agree there. Ill be honest as much as a good tank is invaluable to any group a good group of dps that know their classes and have a high skill ceiling are just as important for smooth runs. Find yourself a solid crew a d stick with them i rkon
---
Would also recommend LeatrixPlus, got tons of nice options which dont really modify your UI
---
&gt;23 pm
---
Wtf is 23 pm?
---
Do you even English? Synonyms for:
---
**invisible**: discreet, inconspicuous, unnoticeable, unobtrusive
---
aka *not readily seen or noticed*
---
**stealth**: backstairs, behind-the-scenes, clandestine, covert, furtive, hole-and-corner, hugger-mugger, hush-hush, private, privy, secret, sneak, sneaking, sneaky, stealthy, surreptitious, undercover, underground, underhand, underhanded
---
aka *undertaken or done so as to escape being observed or known by others*
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Just because they both relate to **concealed** doesn't mean they are synonyms.
---
THIS! 
---
The most reliable way I've found to farm gold as a raid spec disc priest. Did this for hours on stream the other night.
---
http://www.twitch.tv/slitterbox/v/512013218?sr=a&amp;t=5533s
---
Because killing horde is not cool i guess. On zandalari tribe eu hordes had their asses handed to them so hard before MC ,they started migrating away. It sucks because now we have unbalanced server. The worst part.. its not even that good honor.
---
Exactly. I've seen horde posted at the front of BRM and are spread out evenly all the way to BRD and BRS entrances. When you respawn you just get the next group.
---
It does, but you really need a group of 7+ people to spam it on.
---
so...it should not be used because you cant upgrade it instantly? I mean you could, y'know. Get an upgrade then work on the other upgrade making it okay to release the set bonus.
---
Transfer off. There are servers where this doesn't happen 24/7 and it's fairly even.
---
Classic does not have that feature without typing in the script. Retail does, but Classic does not.
---
You have a few here and there that are assholes but most of them are wholesome individuals.
---
I had a warlock who would only start hellfiring once there was 1 or 2 mobs left.  Not sure how he arrived at *that* decision.
---
rage potions and spring/swift swim potions have made the difference for me multiple times so far and are super cheap by consumable standards. biggest issues is closing gaps. 
---
maybe try making an intercept hamstring macro . piercing howl is also good to close gaps since it works beyond just melee range as a slow
---
The reliable money from lasher runs is in maximizing the amount of dreamfoil per run. Drops from lashers are very streaky, some runs you get barely anything but then you'll get some with 5-6 greens, a bunch of life essences, maybe a blue or epic boe. I average 75g per 5 runs after auctioning all the herbs.
---
Military time. 11pm
---
I only have 2 extra mouse buttons but I use the clique addon and can’t really heal without it. Alternatively if you keep WASD just use a few less letters but use their shift AND CTRL variations
---
I just took that data from warcraftlogs/ironforge.pro where it’s an 80:20 split :P ofc not every raiding guild uses it but most are
---
I got it on a first try. However i cant drop arena belt.
---
In classic, yes, because you cannot have both on one faction and there was no reason to distinguish them. In retail, paladin is still pink whereas shaman is dark blue.
---
On my server, Bloodfang, a lot of lvl 60s hang out in Ironforge. I'm guessing it's the same
---
Calm down there boy
---
&gt;It depends how many Alliance PvE server players are keen on Battlegrounds.
---
Not as many as Horde PvP players. Horde will have queues no matter what, just depends how bad they will be.
---
I did, and he told me it was reportable. Thought it sounded strange too.
---
My biggest thing as a tank is to mark a target, regardless of how many mobs you are about to engage.  If your dps is good they will stick with that target and you won't have a problem.  If they are bad and pull a non marked target then that is on them.  
---
I just did a ton of Mara yesterday with no CC so most pulls were:
---
Mark a mob
---
Regrowth self (rejuve warlock if there was one)
---
Shift to bear
---
Hit enrage if its up
---
Charge/FF pull
---
Demo roar
---
Maul the skull
---
Swipe if 3 or more
---
If more than 3 tab target the next and swipe again
---
By the time the skull is down you should have a lock on aggro, but if you're worried you can mark a cross as the next target.  
---
Also as dps I love when a tank marks.  Trying to decide which mob to dps when the tank is tab targetting is a pain.
---
In Scholo you have those bastards that mana burn though.
---
I've tried using invis pots 3 times so far to get away from different gank squads in world PvP. On every one of those occasions the non-warlock classes trailing me had detect invisibility on.
---
Use free action potion or just give up.
---
same here
---
Go on.. back into your cave you go ya little hobgoblin. No use in you being out here
---
Holy shield is a nice thing, but yeah you can dip into ret pretty heavily too.  If you're not tanking raids there's really no reason to even bother.
---
Why not take it on a greed roll when bobody else needs it ?
---
Personally haven't seen any habitual drain life warlocks either, but I have seen a few that will tap to 10% at the start of a fight or 50% before a fight and wait for heals. 
---
Although there are plenty of locks that will actually drink/eat between fights. My all-time favorite warlock was this one guy that bandaged immediately after fights, even if I had plenty of mana. He even thanked me for healing his tap damage.
---
The alliance sides fault for quitting. Bigglesworth was 50/50,  yall pussy ass ally had a mass exodus. The real problem is too many people that don't pvp, signed up for a pvp server. Too many kids. Too many hurt feelings. Too many entitled.
---
I think the word few is perfect here. Maybe you need to brush up on the definition if you don't think it applies. It is generally used when the number is more than 1, but small in number to the relative total. In this case relative total can be objective. I've been alive for 300+ months, so 4 months is 'a few' to me in that case. WoW has been around for ~180 months, so again I think 'a few' is a great term. Hope this helps you better understand what the phrase 'a few' means!
---
you'll only be able to farm enough in 2 weeks on a dead server, or if they turn on more layers again.  the bugs are going to be camped 24/7 and dying the moment they spawn in all the hives on these megaservers
---
Probably to a point, but the fact that many people play multiple classes at high level sort of changes that thought.  I played rogue and dps warrior until wrath of the lich king.  I just like melee dps for whatever reason.  Played mostly death knights after that.  
---
Decided to main a healer this time around having never played one.  Am I a rogue in priest’s clothing or was I a priest maining the wrong classes?
---
If we were all on rp servers and “playing the role” the entire time we were logged in I think you would see certain personalities gravitate to specific classes, but for just general play there is a lot of crossover and I believe it ultimately comes down to how you currently plan on experiencing the game.  I very easily could have made a rogue again, already knowing just about everything I would need to.  It would have made leveling easier, and also an improvement for pvp situations, but I decided on a support class for the first time ever in a game, maybe just to “give back” in some weird way?
---
Sure, but it also offers crit and stats..
---
I intend to, but I am mostly talking about the gear itself. I suppose when I got into Classic I expected more laid back people. Grown people who used to play back in the day, have stuff going on now so sure it takes a while, but we're just having fun. I was way wrong. People are more obsessed with gear, stats, numbers etc. than ever. Saw a dude get kicked out of a pug for not having a trinket. I was like, "Damn..I thought we were just chillin'.".
---
As you said though, I am gonna find another guild, but I have been in several and thus far they have all had the same kind of attitude.
---
i literally died in IF repair building next to the bank
---
right after this... lmao
---
Oh, I get it now.
---
Camp sites.
---
AITA wow version (warior tauren).
---
My game bugged during a wyvern flight I got dismounted into the dam of Loch Modan, so I had to walk to undercity. On my way I met
---
* A hunter dwarf 60 gathering plant in wetlands that I killed, he saw me coming and had a freezing trap waiting for me
---
* Killed a warrior gnome 60 in arathi farming rock golem, he did not really see me coming so I got the opening
---
* Killed a mage gnome 30 in hillsbrad, I hate gnome and mage
---
* Charged and broke the knees of a lvl35 dwarf warrior before realizing that he was a warior so I just let him on the side of the road without kneecaps
---
* Charged and got killed by a druid heal in hillsbrad foothill, probably should have cracked a few timer
---
So in your opinions, going on to a rampage on innoncent target minding their own business : AITA. I pretty much attacked whatever "crossed" my line of sight and just managed to not mortal strike a poor warrior (I'm on a balanced pvp server)
---
To be fair staff of dominance is BiS for resto druids.
---
Back this up with a blue post please? I do not believe this to be an exploit at all, it is common practice and id be surprised if it wasnt allowed.
---
Hey man gratz, I got my leaf saturday night myself, it's a good feeling. I had the sinew from ony for almost 6 weeks before getting my leaf cause my first guild also dicked me over, then fell apart. So I found a new guild who pro'd the leaf to me when it dropped (of course cause I already had sinew lol). Rhok makes the hunter feel whole! Enjoy the quest if you havent done it yet.
---
This is how I look at it, and I couldn't agree more.
---
That's exactly my thought.  Seems to me when people are griefed so hard they can't PvP OR PvE they're missing out on 100% of the game.
---
Yeah it feels bad. But if I understand correctly you are hearing your ret Palas for phase 3. They have the highest uptime on the nightfall debuff.
---
TRUE
---
they have to be in animal form when poly gets applied
---
Being raid ready shouldn't be a major issue. It's just about making a minimum amount of gold for any required consumables and then logging for raid. If you want the gear, commit two hours a week on raid day. Find a guild that raids on the day you need.
---
I also expect a guild doing full buffs and consumables for everyone and still wiping has a very bad raid leader or something. Consumable requirements are pretty low for a decently geared group of full 60s.
---
oh but i used it back in vanilla
---
Who's the tank
---
Mind if I ask what MS+1 is? Have only heard of MS&gt;OS
---
Eh, depends where you go. EPL was unplayable for alliance yesterday. Roaming gank squads of about 20 horde.
---
I agree with this. If you have nothing better to do, I suppose, why not. But, that seems like the sign of a problem.
---
I'm glad that Horde are having a great time while I stare at a grey screen. (I know it's not just a Horde only thing, that's just how it is on my server).
---
Would y’all rather of classic wow plus or BC?
---
Don't worry
---
Ony head drops every single kill and if it's going to a ret you should be able to or close to being able to do split ony runs every 5 days.
---
Of all the purple drops ony head is the least worth being salty over.
---
Elemental fire is like 6-8g on big servers, but the transmute is like phase 5 or so i think?
---
Jesus christ this seems like nirvana. Wish I was in your guild, homie.
---
Lol bro, get back to bfa. There you play the game that developers did intend. Here the game is made by the players and you are more than free to play it the way you like. So yeah, i can just laugh off my ass that devs mean smtng on classic, did you ask them lol?
---
Raid logging isn't "having nothing outside of wow", it's when you log on each week just for the raids and then log right back off. It's more about being active in the guild community than it is about being a no-life.
---
Congratulations, only a single digit % of players managed that so far.
---
sure he means like fireball, or shadowbolt. its true. calm down
---
🙂
---
&gt;"Come to the gates of AQ at 11:30 am if you want an ass kicking!"
---
You mean like how it was in vanilla?
---
What? 10 hours a day and flasks? Do you have a full raid group or are you trying to go in with like 25 people? That guild sounds like a mess with no leadership or skill. Do they understand the mechanics of the raid? I’m just really confused how it takes that long unless there’s 25 people
---
That's actually the definition of hindsight but okay.
---
I'm really hoping the number of mats is upped to match the fact that servers are more populated than back in the day.
---
I mean, it pretty much does. So yup!
---
He's the mage!
---
Correct:

 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-thorium-brotherhood-reputation](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-thorium-brotherhood-reputation)
---
&gt; horde
---
Exactly:)
---
I never got the pants to drop back in vanilla.  I can't tell you how many runs and I never even saw them drop.  Not that the set was good but I just wanted the complete set.  Maybe I'll have more luck this time.
---
I play probably more like 4 hours 5 days a week. I have a job and a life and Classic doesn't require more than that. You can do MC/Ony in 2 hours with a decent guild and that's not a massive time investment. Dungeons you can obviously do in less, and as a Rogue your gold farming capabilities are far better than mine as a Priest, so there's a lot you can do solo. If you can devote a 3 hour time slot a few days a week even that's all that's needed.
---
If I could, I'd play 20 hours a day - this game is fun to me not a chore.  If the game is a chore, then maybe you should consider doing something else instead.
---
The Lasher packs by the boss don't agro from the boss itself, so you can do the ledge to rock pathing without needing to clear any of those 3 packs.  As soon as the boss gets to \~45% and the cave opens, the imps will agro everything.  Keep doing the rock to ledge hop a few time to path the imps and lashers up onto the ledge, then run back on the ledge as far as you can and jump off and run to the safe spot just at the opening to the cave.  
---
If you are looking at the cave, its a tine square piece of the "ledge" just  to teh right of teh cave opening that has no pathing to it, so as soon as you hop onto it everything stands still and evades.  just spam the invis pot at this point and as soon as combat drops you will invis.  the imps will run back to the cave entrance temporarily but then run up and reset by the boss.  while invis still just walk into the cave.
---
I've tried to find a evade spot in the cave so you don't need potions, but have not found one yet.
---
Congrats! But seriously though...how did you move decursive?
---
Depending on your level you should spam ZF/BRD/LBRS.
---
Skirmishes and small battles do take place. - straight from the mouth of Thrall
---
Ok so, clearly, to get this level of gear, you don’t need to play 10 hours a day. You just need to farm MC once a week, that can be done in 1 or 2 days.
---
Consumables are absolutely not required at this stage, appart maybe one or 2 fire potion for rag.
---
But to clear MC, it’s easier to already have some stuff that you can easily get.
---
If you don’t, you may quickly not be able to kill anyone but lvl 59 or less, as the hp pool and output damage from other player will raise and yours don’t.
---
You killed some folks on a PvP realm and moved on. You‘re playing the game as intended.
---
I lost the neck from magma to him two days prior too.
---
when healing to full you risk overhealing, which basically means you're just wasting your mana for no reason.  
---
a good way to look at it is by looking at each healing spell in terms of HPM (Heals per Mana) if you have a spell that heals 100 and costs 100 mana HPM=1. if your target is at 20/100 hp. and you cast it you overheal by 20, effectively wasting 20 mana.
---
Everybody needs to learn and your post is completely in the right. 
---
One thing we all have to consider though is that an experienced tank prefers to lead and take charge of the run, so it IS kinda normal for people to expect the tank to lead. Ofc, if you come out and say at first that you don't know the way or the pulls, that's completely fine. I think the key here is openess. Some tanks are not willing to say they don't know the way, cause that can get you a lot of shit, but I know I appreciate honest people, and would never shun a new player learning the role.
---
New players can learn, nasty cunts will always be cunts. If you are a tank, study the map of the dungeon before every run, I guarantee by the third run you'll already be rembering the way.
---
Got it a month or two back with some dude's weekly pug and finally got it last week with my guild and pretty much. We only had like... 3 deaths and almost got him before he submerged, just with the added benefit of going into UBRS and tossing the fire resist from the mobs in there on the melee. Also doesn't help though that most of our melee seem to be the ones that pull aggro the quickest, made it a super easy kill though.
---
Learn how to adapt and play?
---
Hope not, in my case! Sul'13 is DEAD hahaha.. I doubt we'll be able to open it with donations, probly will have to wait for it to open normally.
---
I’ll check out the Clique addon when I get home. I also have two extra mouse buttons! One is macro’d to cast my lightning shield &amp; windfury weapon and the other is my quick heal. Having that quick heal mapped there has saved me many times lol
---
What movie is this?
---
Seems to me like you’re just not running it consistantly.  I’ve spent 2 weeks doing rend runs and saw 2 feldtriker and three time i saw double dal’rends.   If you don’t buy lottery tickets every week dont ask yourself why you’re not winning the jackpot.  
---
It’s the same shit scenario to farm HoJ. You gotta find reliable players and farm the shit out of it.
---
GL hope they drop soon !

Please release a barber shop so o change change my Taurens horns.

---
The proud uninformed MT is my #1 petpeeve
---
You "HOPE" it does anyways.
---
If everyone is in BGs PvPing, is there really any difference to a normal server?  Other than be suceptible to griefing?  After 15 years of being on PvP servers I find Classic to be 99% griefing and people only attacking when they have an almost guaranteed chance of winning, whether by numbers, gear, or levels.  Doesn't sound like an enjoyable enviornment, especially if you're not on the dominant faction.
---
I'm guessing typo.  He used "5 pm" and "7 pm", not 1700 hours and 1900 hours, which is why i discounted military time as an explanation.  Best guess is he meant 12 pm and his fingers were 1 key off each time.
---
Elvui. Great options and you'll be done fucking around with 90% of the add-ons you have.
---
The draw in Vanilla was you could fight one on one for a rare mining node, for example, or a huge brawl could start in Hillsbrad. It was organic PvP open world when in a PvE server you had to flag for it.
---
The issue now is no different than it was in vanilla, but the volume of players on a server this time is much higher. Also, people know what they're doing this time
---
I play alliance on gehen and is is pretty decently balanced. Horde usually have dm while we keep entrances to strat and so on. People are fighting everywhere, both horde and alliance are being ganked. If i make a blackrock run it is a lot of horde that kills me but also a lot of alliance that kills them.
---
Any really. SM, ZF, even such as DM or WC can be good because you can do huge pulls and then just loot them all. Then you just sell the greens / blues / cloth.
---
No one in my guild is expected to flask. We provided flasks to the raid for our first week of split runs since we were running 20-25 people in each group. Other consumables are expected every raid. Making an MC clear efficient and clean is worth the 20-50g per week it costs to farm basic consumables currently. It’s not about necessity, it’s about the raider mindset.
---
I catch people trying it use invis pots to get away all the time. They don't know I buff myself with this and underwater breathing every 10 mins.
---
Stances aren't on the GCD. 
---
There is a stance cooldown where you can't swap to another stance for the length of one GCD, but it's not actually a GCD. 
---
Like if you have a macro for berserker stance + intercept, you will swap stances and immediately intercept. If you have a macro for defensive stance + taunt, you will swap stances and immediately taunt. 
---
I'm at work, but I can link you some macros later if you're interested. I have all of my stance-limited abilities macro'd to swap stances if I'm in the wrong stance, and it makes stance dancing stupidly easy.
---
why? i have no issues with the game and enjoy playing with the people in my guild
---
Typical Zoomers not appreciating those who paved the way for them.
---
Yeah Succy does make it a bit annoying (as an Orc) but easy enough to mouseover kick/blind the cast. I guess being horde, not many Alliance use Succy because UD just WotF it anyway. Most I see use VW for Sac, but if you're not daft you can just wait out the Sac lol.
---
BWL because bindings and now that’s all I need for TFury to fulfill my dream of having Thunderfury on Thunderfury server
---
how does it take too long. the time it takes them to cast 3-4GCD life taps is the same time as it takes to use a full duration bandage.   
---
if you aren't using bandages as a healer then you're doing it wrong, they are extremely useful tools for healers.
---
Goblin rocket helm, into gnomish deathray, into goblin mortar, into sapper, into ww/execute?
---
Fancy 30 minute combo indeed.
---
I macro "/cast \[correct\] stance" to every stance-specific ability, and that's all you really need macro-wise.
---
Yet amazingly enough every single response understood and answered him... except this one.
---
Not reportable, it's the right thing to do.
---
Don't worry, everyone knew what you meant!
---
It's just annoying as a healer to be at 25% mana and drink for 30 seconds and watch the lock just sit there at 20% hp until I'm full, expecting a heal. Like, you can drink too it is not forbidden knowledge. I get it if you're trying to speedrun, heals can drink during the pull/dps
---
Most probably, but I was talking about *there*.
---
I think a higher level player will party up with them, get a few mobs down to below 10% HP or so, and then the warlocks all finish the mobs off with drain soul.
---
I'm not positive though!
---
We are preparing for the 49 bracket. I personally have made guides which can be found on our guild discord.

Anyone interested; we are located on Deviate Delight. Guild name is &lt;Forty Niners&gt;.

Absolutely, just entirely unsure what the Ony head you mentioned in your original post has to do with QS?

Good luck getting to rank 11 without super mount.

On the other side you could also just go Strat ud.

You should read what paranoia does from the fel hunter
---
My guild is awesome but I don't think we're that rare. I bet you can find a similar situation if you shop around. 
---
Keep an eye out for guilds recruiting that clear MC and ony. Find one that raids during times you're typically free for 3 hours. 
---
Show up with bandages and some food buffs for bosses. If you show up 90% of the time, know your class well and don't mess up easy boss mechanics you will usually gear up pretty quickly.
---
I can't tell whether you posted this on reddit by mistake and want actual opinions or you posted it here as a conscious decision.

In case 1, please post it to the warrior discord

In case 2, lmao what are you ****** ******** ***** **********? Of course you go dual wield tanking unless you are a ****** nab, just get dire maul buff, ony buff, warchief.... Why am I even talking to you? Just uninstall you piece of ***** ******* **********

Oh you sweet summer child.

druid tanks benefit threat from self-heals so they are probably more than happy to do that

The epic book dropped in DM a month ago and I sat there for 20 seconds contemplating if I should pass it to my tank. I finally did and it hurt... that's 1000g right there. He was a guildie so yeah...
---
If you're anything but the hardest of hardcore players, Alchemy is almost certainly functionally the best choice, because no other prof competes with its goldmaking power. Engi is the best for min/maxing both PvE and PvP combat.

Interesting read, good luck on your goal!

This is something which has come up, and usually the response from blizzard is on a PvP server, it's "ok" but not as much on a pve server.  The reasoning given is that on a pvp server you can kill the person training the mobs, but that isn't always possible on a pve server.  It can be an issue when it is the same faction doing it and you can't do anything about it.
---
Specifically for level 1s checking for Kazzak/Azuregos I can't say since you aren't really fucking over their gameplay.
---
Oh I meant EU.
---
Remember, all you have to do is just play at non-peak times and you're going to be just fine. /S
---
Right, that is my point.  Thrall is saying that we aren't at war while simultaneously acknowledging battles are happening.  OP is arguing that "being at war" isn't an excuse for World PvP, and technically he is correct, but it's a flimsy distinction.  Just like technically Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and the "War on Terror" were not actually wars.
---
4am for you might just be 1am for some Russians. Not sure how it figures in NA tho (I guess Ausies?).
---
Yeah because you can raid log without playing pretty long before it. Well you can, if you are one of those who take the work of other granted and leech upon them. 
---
If you aren’t 60 now it means that you probably will take the next 6 months just to get raid ready. If you can even get at the point, because maybe you can’t do a single dungeon because you need to go offline for the day after finding a full group. 
---
Again if you can’t play more than 2 hours per day there is a high chance you can’t do any level 60 dungeons. Well unless again you just leech on the work of other people and hope your guild carries your ass through them.
---
If you don’t wanna pay respec cost, just use sinister strike and pretend you are in combat. As long as you don’t wanna big dick the meters nobody will notice :)
---
Haven't been there since layering got removed just before phase 2. Back then it was never really crowded, but also never empty. Could probably get a decent farm in, but if you're still levelling I feel there's a big risk of getting ganked there still actually.
---
It's still worth checking out. otherwise you could kill the other mobs in the zone and look out for the several patrolling air elementals that seem to be all over the place, just not that concentrated.
---
Also to show your power level to other players. 
---
“Well, this looks like a knuckle fight I can join. They have gear as mediocre as mine. Why the hell did he MS’d me for 3k? Oh, he had Menethil transmogrified to whirlwind axe.”
---
It’s not behind your back. He’s talking to one who ain’t a part of your party. But nevertheless always lovely with some positive words of ones doings -light em up
---
Yikes
---
i dont think its unplayable at all. ive been playing it perfectly fine
---
Kind of an unknown really.  The servers have much higher populations now than they ever did in vanilla.  Idk what effect battlegrounds will have, but I do doubt how long the current camping of BRM is sustainable.  I don’t see how it is that entertaining.  I have seen basically the whole path to BRD camped out for hours.
---
There is a certain element of it doesn’t have to be this way also.  How many level 60s are just hanging out in IF for the alliance or leveling alts?  There could be more of a fight back than there is.  When it is time to raid we always steam roll the horde on the way in.  Much of the getting to dungeons could be done if people fought their way in together.  Instead the mentality is death rub and advance as far as possible.
---
Incendius seems to have 55-45 alliance to horde
---
well HoTs will pull threat on the ads, so you should wait until they at least get a thunder clap off on hte group
---
Did You do it? Did You get banned?
---
actually, those are stealthed, not invisible
---
right?
---
Can you victim complex dudes maybe realize that the problem is the world-pvp honor system and has *absolutely nothing* to do with faction balance?
---
I mean I understand that it's easier for people to go to Reddit and whine than to do research, but this is getting ridiculous.
---
Your "holy" alliance is doing the exact same thing, in the same amount, over and over again. Just like the same type of players does this as horde.
---
The problem is that all of the ganking you experience is done by horde. This is *because you're an alliance player* - you *can not* get ganked by alliance. This does *not* mean that only alliance is getting ganked. This is delusion in its purest form.
---
So why assume the worst?
---
I watched mine do it. I wish I could have my Lil'KT in classic.
---
You think you're smart, but you aren't.
---
As an enhancement shaman is it worth getting black dragon scale amor?
---
wtf is the matter with you lol, its not even a good ring
---
The healer is my personal mana battery
---
Thrash + Mirah as baseline....
---
Kroll + mirah is 0.8% DPS gain
---
Dal rend set is 1.54% DPS gain
---
Trahs blade and mirah's is still a really good combo.
---
But as a warrior, I'd rather spend 400g on a pair of edgemasters. Opens you up to axes, swords and daggers. Nobody wants a deathbringer off Onyxia but warriors, so it's an uncontested item. CHT go to dagger rogues but warriors can take them too.
---
Well i was merely trying to draw a comparison.   Dont have exact numbers no ,    but the fact is . what is happening to servers when are lagging is artificial and borderline bad.  If the servers crashed it would be better . Thats the frustrating part. Blizzard is aware and ignorant  because they implemented this Uber-batch when servers are melting and thats whats wrong about it.  The one huge batch resolving in several minutes.  
---
The servers are bad by the nature because they dont lag / nor are overclocked ,  they just Batch everything.   i could accept lag as solution because yes the pvp was massive. This is completely different topic tho
---
People can safely ignore GFPP now aside from Ragnaros only maybe. They won't be able to do it in BWL.
---
If it's a full pug and it's worth 100g+ I do think everyone should need tbh. If the epic book dropped worth 1000g I'm not just giving that to the pug warrior. That's my truefaith vestment, hide of the wild, and partially my Eye of Shadow right there. 3 BiS worth of gold is worth needing on.

We have a 15 year old case story in how Blizzard failed to balance the factions and what the end result is.
---
I honestly hope Blizzard does BC servers so people can whine about PvP some more when the balance is like 90% Horde due to broken ass Blood Elf racials.
---
Am I being foolish for taking spell resistance gear for my PvP set?  Obviously it's not top priority, and I'm not stacking arcane or FR at this point, but my PvP set currently has me at 107 shadow resistance and 97 frost.  Is that worth, over taking other items that probably have more stam and int?  I'm a Druid if it matters, HOTW/NS.
---
Not an addon, but still kind of important is to setup macros which will automatically switch to the appropriate stance, for example
---
&gt;showtooltip  
---
&gt;/cast Battle stance  
---
&gt;/cast Overpower
---
and just do that for appropriate abilities, like Intercept or Taunt.
---
I tend to keep Wis on the healer and very rarely does that ever become a problem. But DPS, they get Salv unless I trust them enough to self regulate, but even then, most of the time they request Salv anyway.
---
I’d rather just avoid the problem if there’s easier ones to run first,  sound like Strath UD will be best for tonight
---
i always thought that they should force a faction on character creation when things become unbalanced. if you wanted to play a certain faction then you just go to another server that allows it.
---
I dont know if it would work in practice but it's been an issue for forever. no I dont think war mode is a good solution.
---
Pallys are amazing in 5 mans, and I’d go as far as saying they’re the best. In BRD, I tank as a paladin while in healing spec. I do fine, and I frequently pull 400+ dps since consecration + improved ret aura is op. No other tank is even remotely comparable for dps’ing aoe packs.
---
Check out xpoff.com
---
They have a classic twink section on the forums
---
In addition, put /startattack at the bottom of any applicable ability macro.
---
Okay , I have a question .. I’m a Druid so I’ve always teleported to moonglade.. my hunter friend needed to go there , and I had NO IDEA how to get him. The first thing I read online said either we could ride north through Felwood, or swim and drown. For some godforsaken reason we chose Felwood, realized there was a long involved quest chain to make friends with the dudes for access to their extremely long and unsneakable tunnel, and by the time we were sick of corpse crawlin it was like almost 3 am my time . Please tell me there wasn’t another way in Felwood that didn’t have to do with that tunnel ???? I feel so bad for us going to that horrible place but I’d feel even stupider if there was just a path that led into Felwood that did not involve the tunnel ...
---
Someone who picked pvp, but really should have played on a normal server.
---
They should've made the honor system have only lvl 60s give honor
---
Spinal Reaper and BRE should each drop at about 8%. If you're set on a particular one, the average player will go at least 8 weeks without seeing it drop.
---
Deathbringer is about 6%, and you should expect to wait 11 kills between axes. The most unlucky 5% of groups will go for a whole calendar year without seeing one.
---
At this stage - with BWL coming early 2020 - you have a good chance of killing Nefarian before seeing your weapon drop if you choose to hold out for something in particular.
---
Just get whatever you can get your grubby orcish hands on.

Hi. Three of my friends want to play as Paladins and only level together. We're going to try to 3 man as much content as possible with just us. 
---
The issue is that one of my friends wants to play 2 Paladins and a Mage. This is a good thing for many reasons:
---
1) Free water
---
2) Less gear competition
---
3) Poly will help with 3 manning
---
The issue is that a mage isn't a paladin, and throws off the whole gimmick of us all being paladins. 
---
How can I convince my friend to abandon all of these great reasons to play a mage, and embrace the stupidity of the 3 paladin gang?
---
horde players pepelaugh
---
Considering the sheer number of players on Classic servers and the % of them being tryhards, once BWL is clear people will start farming the mats for the war effort (if they are not doing it by now). Since we're going the #nochanges route, the materials and their quantity are already known. I'd say the war effort will be completed the same day it's released or a few days tops, at least on the big/competitive servers.
---
It took me three days to finish a single kill quest in Felwood. Getting ganked by a roving 60 hunter/warrior combo gets old. I've been training professions and my alt in the meantime.
---
My MC/ony raid takes my guild an hour and half. You don’t need to play 10 hours to have gear.
---
They Will never open. A new wow Will be seen, The hive Will take over zones and Hiverimmar Will form in place of orgrimmar. Hail The Hive!
---
TLDR: Communicate with your group/healer
---
It was barely tuned at all
---
You can raidlog and complete every raid without hassle if you and your guildmates are good players.
---
I'm spreading my own experience, sure it's not all the time but it is the case nearly every time I personally go to BRM. I shouldn't of said "most of the time" when I only go to BRM once a day not even every day, so i'm sorry about that.
---
&gt; Let's see their runs on classiclogs if they even play the game
---
...you know the author has been an active raider since vanilla, right?
---
PvPing as fury lol
---
Where are these lashers?
---
Lol searching through you Reddit comments it’s very clear you are mentally unstable. Best of luck to you man. There is no point arguing with a crazy person. 
---
There is plenty more to do at 60 that just raid, and there are plenty of reasons why people aren’t 60 yet. The problem isn’t casual players, it’s blizzards shitty release schedule coupled with severe faction imbalance and too large of servers. That is it. End of story. But you hold on to your delusions of grandeur cuz you’re a gatekeeping elitist showing cuz mere mortals that we play a video game “wrong”
---
As an undead mage, I feel attacked. Almost literally
---
Use rank 1. I have no issues holding aggro with rank 1. I can throw seal of wisdom or justice of wisdom down as well. As long as my party focuses skull we're golden. I hover around 80% Mana the entire pull, leaves plenty of room for an errant pat coming in or something. 
---
I love tanking as pally :)
---
Got an invite to a Scholo run as the tank. The 4 other people were in a guild with each other.  It was partially cleared, so I asked what was up.  They said their tank friend was too low level and they were having trouble with the trash pulls.  Didn't think anything of it at the time.
---
Clear the instance wipe free until we're at the area with the 7 back-to-back bosses, which at the time I needed a ton of loot off of.  The moment I pull the first mini boss, the rest of the group starts running out of the instance, leaving me to die.  As soon as I released I got booted.  On the death run, I see their level 56 Warrior guild-mate waiting outside the instance, then the other 4 zone out, and the 5 of them zone in together.
---
So they used me to clear the difficult parts of the instance, that their friend was unable to clear successfully himself, then boot me on the part of the instance that drops the stuff I needed.
---
Which is exactly what he said he was considering... You seem like the type of idiot that goes "JOIN A PVE SERVER LOL" after someone complains about anything PVP related on their level 60 that they've been raiding on and invested a huge amount of time on. I love the game, but man is the community ever comprised of 90% hard-line shit-heads.
---
Agreed, getting randomly gamles is pvp server life. The complaints are mostly about toxic camping on unbalanced servers where the smaller faction gets shafted hard if they want to play at all.
---
In general the deep prot build will work for most guilds. Onyxia is a bit different, just because of her threat dropping shenanigans. I wouldn't build my talents or gear around her. If you want to do DW Fury prot you will need to be hit capped, and have a large amount of crit. World buffs are also a large part of fury/prot. What I would suggest is going deep prot and practicing your shield slam and revenge timings. Having those down is the most important thing. Start gearing towards more threat, even while prot. Use more crit pieces, get a weapon skill of 305. You only really need the fury/prot when your other furies are pushing 700 dps. If your guild regular reaches that dps, then it does look like you will need to swap over. Full wrath/might gear and going fury/prot usually performs worse than wearing threat gear and being deep prot.
---
&gt; So because the guy is in the raid and part of the kill, they are not allowed to roll on gear that is just as much an upgrade to them? 
---
The reason he is not allowed to roll on the gear is because it is a much better upgrade for the non-healers in the raid. Wanting to roll against them for gear that is better for them is loot whore mentality, not guild mentality.  
---
&gt; Why should a frostbolt spamming mage be more deserving to someone who came as a healer, healed the raid for what exactly? 
---
The frostbolt-spamming mage will be able to contribute more to the guild and to future raids with this mainspec gear than the druid would with offspec gear. It's not a matter of deserving (loot whore mentality), it is a matter of total value to the guild (guild mentality).  
---
&gt; They are "fully geared" why would anyone show up to a raid, to spend an hour there killing bosses to not even get a chance at loot? 
---
Yes, the druid has received 10 pieces of loot as reward for their contribution to the guild. The reason you continue to show up to raids after you have been fully geared out by that raid is to contribute back to the people who didn't get fully geared in that amount of time. Again, guild mentality.  
---
&gt; That sounds pretty stupid to me. 
---
Congrats, you're a loot whore.
---
Oh, I immediately recognized the dulcet tones of that lunatic.
---
i would recommend sticking in prot spec and try gearing for threat before fully respeccing to fury-prot as for most guilds being in deep prot with a good balance of threat/mitigation gear is enough. raid content in classic is easy enough that you do not need full tank mitigation BiS for MC, you're better off using some non-leather DPS pieces that improve your threat. some examples are rings (Magni's Will / Blackstone Ring / Tarnished Elven Ring) or trinkets (Blackhand's Breadth / Hand of Justice / Mark of the Chosen) or mail / plate armor with decent well rounded stats (Valor Gear / Bloodmail Boots / Savage Gladiator Chain / Eldritch Reinforced Legplates / Brigram Girdle / Omokk's Girth Restrainer etc). 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/edit#gid=1107319288 this spreadsheet here has decent information on good threat items to keep an eye for. 
---
for Onyxia specifically, she's tricky because her fireballs in phase 2 target the people highest on threat and also wipes the aggro of the people she fireballs, so the maintank is always guaranteed to get his aggro wiped and its up to the offtank on Onyxia to pick up her in phase 3 by doing enough threat in phase 1 &amp; 2 (but not high enough to get fireballed in phase 2 as then you have both tanks at the bottom of the threat table).
---
What difference does that make?   Someone has to be the lowest in every group.
---
&gt; horde so cowardly he removed his flair
---
I think so yes.
---
Can you show a screenshot or video of this spot? I know you can reset them on the pillars but had no idea it's possible on a ledge.
---
I just checked, LibHealComm in Elvui is one version behind at the moment. LibHealComm got a lot of updates recently and Elvui has a slow release cycle.
---
I'm not taking chances with mods around here, one word and I was done
---
I’d argue that activision has been bringing more quality games than blizzard recently
---
retail loot might be bland and uninteresting...
---
but I see more loot drama on a weekly basis on classic than I've seen in the last 10 years on retail.
---
and it just never stop. even for crap item like mark of the dragon lord.
---
Stockades doesn't have boss drops but it is a high density of mobs that you can clear in less than 10 minutes for a shot at BOE twink rares. You can also charge people 1g or 2g a run for xp and tell them you get all loot. Plenty of people lvling alts that will pay for the xp boost and it adds 4-8g per run, which is roughly 20-40g/hr alone.
---
What is bfa?
---
I have no idea what you're attempting to say in the rest of your comment
---
Classic+ material for those who want it!
---
Just wait till you get to Scholomance and West DM my friend, those places are the real hells
---
Uh. Ok? It is relatively balanced, compared to the really bad realms. 
---
Alliance completely own BRM to the point that horde cannot go to BRD without dying 10 times. Alliance frequently own any given other zone as well. Horde levelers cannot go 5 minutes without being ganked. Everyone is feeling the pain.
---
Notsureifserious.jpg
---
As a Priest, can I start charging for Prayer of Fort 2?  That takes mana and a regent.
---

---
You can only compare them on the service side of thing, which nobody argue against.
---
Comparing them technically is utter non sense.
---
Interesting, really. Are you playing on US?  Because here in EU I have never seen that. You always learn something new.
---
Probably because most of our hearthstones are there and it's quicker to mount from there and go rather than fly to Thorium and then go from there.
---
Start in darkshore, go to the most northern point, start swimming a bit until the chat changes to moonglade, drown and revive in moonglade.
---
If blasted lands is not packed for you, The ogres @ approximately 50,50 are green (for spirit tap) and drop a lot of cloth, silver, and grey weapons. If you don't have spirit tap, the ones in the NW are grey and similar loot tables. There are also a few solid chest spawns in that area.
---
There are decent suggestions on here, but I’m gonna reiterate what’s already been said. 
---
Unless the Mage is in a stupor from downing a bunch of sedatives and muscle relaxers before he logged on, odds are that you won’t beat a Mage 1v1 as a Warrior no matter your spec, your trinkets, or your gear. 
---
A bad Mage player could randomly slap his flaccid chode on the keyboard and still endlessly CC/slow you. A good Mage, you’ll never touch. 
---
Mage vs. Warrior has to be the most one-sided, unfair fight in all of WoW. The Mage would have to be extraordinarily bad to lose to a Warrior. Don’t give Mages free honor, just avoid them like the plague, it’s the easiest way. 
---
A man has an opinion.
---
Wew, talking honor points!
---
If you enjoy yourself and have fun while playing I dont see a problem at all.
---
Priests getting upset over eye is so funny to me.  It literally drops every other week.  Most guilds will be selling them within a few months of raiding.
---
Ye that happened on nor---dale, hopefully there are already ali 49 twinks on Shazzrah too and more in progress to be done by the time AB release. Otherwise same goals as 60s, pvp for exalted and r9, maybe off-faction mount if I accumulate enought golds in p4 for turnins.
---
I got the shoulders because truestrike won't drop for me for some reason :D
---
As a shaman, I try to bring as little stress to the party as possible.  Maybe because I know I’m going to ask if I can need on items for my healing set so I try to grease the wheels with kindness
---
Blame them if you want, but players want the mega servers.  It doesn't matter how much people bitch about it, people want huge servers.  If they were capped lower people would still be getting ganked constantly but also bitching about their dead server and how much better it would be if there was enough alliance on their server to form a raid to counter it!
---
The root problem is people overwhelmingly wanting to be horde on pvp servers.
---
Like the Robe that i wanted, the one that give 2% crit. It always goes to holy paly first
---
Um excuse me but I expect ONLY rainbows and cupcakes when I enter a school of necromancy.
---
There is a rumor on my server that the alliance are planning a mass server xfer so it will fuck over the horde come time for AQ.
---
I would enjoy nothing more.
---
Go to retail then
---
The raid was not released but the gate has been there even in the beta i believe.
---
There was that one mage who made a port and used an invis pot. That's when his prey took their rez and the mage then killed them again.
---
For 1v1s against certain classes it's good, but if you're up against Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, your resistances are gonna do fuckall
---
You don't know what hindsight is, do you? Hindsight is looking back. All the things in his post were identifiable before launch day.
---
Bro, im not a tryhard at all but WTF ARE THOSE KEYBINDS NIbbA
---
&gt; horde who put his flair back after being called out
---
How do rets have higher uptime than an OT spamming spamstring? They have no instant attacks.
---
What are you talking about even? All areas have pvp-disabled unless you enable it: on the type of server you should have been choosing with your attitude at least.
---
Good luck getting those true strike shoulders mr.druid. Hope you roll well vs the 8 warriors and rogues.
---
Good job!!
---
You can compare it, but it's utter non sense.
---
It's like comparing orange and apple.
---
What are you even talking about? Try forming coherent sentences.
---
Find a guild who cares more about pvp then pve. Then you should be good.
---
In my first wowclassic Rag kill, we were 4 left, I was one of them, and we were an awfully geared pug. Lots of fun though :)
---
you wanted the game ‘as it was’ and now you have it
---
&gt; Sounds like someone doesn't really understand the power that death has to utterly and completely annihilate meaning.
---
Congrats, you've encountered the first boss of philosophy: There is no Official Judge making calls about right and wrong. 
---
I don't believe this means we don't have to try our hardest to achieve our goals, because I choose not to fight that boss. Nothing good comes from it. Nothing matters - you, me, everyone, the planet could get sucked into the sun and nothing matters. Where does that leave us? In apathy and inaction. That's one alternative. The other is to do something, and deciding on what to do based on whatever morals you adopt - but fuck nihilism and the horse it rode in on, because who fucking cares?
---
Shadow and Frost resistance is extremely useful in PVP because it helps you avoid the CC from frost spells and fears etc. Getting a resist on a fear for example can be the difference between life and death.
---
My experience too. I've resorted to mine farming in HOPES to get a good 1v1 fight..... someday...
---
What's the toss up between the Strat UD/Scholo gloves that make you immune to disarm, versus tier? My hunch is that weapon chain is a desirable enchant in PVP?
---
Every raid wants 8 of them and somehow they are underrated? Lol
---
Is there a way to see enemy health numbers in default UI or what add-on do I need.
---
Should have a relative degree of safety near Kurzan as horde dont venture over there much. Since youre a rogue you have the benefit stealthing and grabbing ores without having to slaughter everything. So if horde are too much of an issue i would wrap it up at venture co (hugging outskirts because thats where the veins are anyway). 
---
And its great way to level mining because veins dont tend to scale well in zones. Currently 230 mining @ lvl 38.
---
Good luck, whichever farming path you take.
---
thanks! feel free to downvote &lt;3 I have 49 &amp; 39s s on A too, just diff realm. See ya in BGs
---
Oh yeah because only the most sane people look through other peoples comment history? Stalker much? 
---
So what funny things do you actually do at 60? When you get there in 6 month? With your daily hour your wife allows you to play?
---
You casuals always love to call anyone elitist who invests more time in stuff they like. So please fuck off and go back playing with your lovely children.
---
I got it on my first Mara run on my mage. (lucky I know) I can confirm it has a chance to proc on each target hit. If you use Arcane Explosion on multiple mobs it has a chance to proc on each one. From what I can tell it is about a 10% proc rate. Its nice, but I still don't use it for aoe farming because I mostly use blizzard and it doesn't work with that.
---
It depends on what you are doing.  If you are trying to raid, no you don't need the talents because you will never be effective.
---
If you are pvping then I have no idea why you don't have command since burst is the only thing a paladin has going for them.
---
Never changed it, stop making up shit.
---
Pvp happened on a pvp server
---
that would be a lie to get you to stop. Keep it up :)
---
This is a repost from 2006
---
Who hurt you?
---
What do herbs sell for in your server?  I get at least a stack of gromsblood and dreamfoil from an hour of runs.  That’s an extra 15g/hour on my server.
---
How did you get feared into MC? To get into MC you have to click on an NPC and have him teleport you there.
---
"expected the demon Hunter vision, but realized you had to actually use your eyes"
---
I’m saying yikes because:
---
1. This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read.
---
2. You have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Seduction can be used more than once so wotf doesn't help much without dealing with her directly.
---
A good rogue would blind as soon as she pops out of invis, but then they better pray they finish me before their stuns wear off.

Cone of cold with 5 points into shatter. IB pull into frost nova. CoC with 1 second left and kite to tighten the pack up. CoC and then use frost nova when CoC has less than 7sec on CD. Then repeat the CoC on 1sec left of frost nova. If you beat the pack with mana left over that means you can work in arcane explosion. If not, just keep at it. At lvl 44 it took me about 6 minutes per pack to kill them. 
---
At lvl 48 I was getting 120k exp/h. I'm lvl 54 and still getting 50k exp/h in there.
---
Its definitely a different game now. Even though it's the same game.
---
People know the farm spots, and questing hot spots, what to do and where to go. Where few months after the game launched 15 years ago we did not have this information, we were still figuring everything out.
---
Greetings from Hunters and their "track invisibility", same usless skill
---
Ahh, I still remember winning the roll against a rogue with my warr, that cape is disguisting to farm, poor rogue :(
---
Warchief's Blessing is the real MVP low level questing buff.
---
There is a sword in mauradon with 1% crit if that is so much more important than the plus heal.   
---
The staff is a small upgrade to the mage blade pluss off hand, sure. That is the final boss in that zone so you are basically talking about all of mc, ony zg and bwl minus that last boss. 
---
A raid is likely trying to gear 7-10 locks and mages each one getting the weapon makes that said go smoother and faster. Over gearing healers at the expense of dps is dumb. You are free to gear your raid how you want but it would be very sub optimal giving a paladin that weapon over dps.
---
Iron counterweight is better.
---
shitpost by shitplayer
---
No kidding. So many runs, no boe blues.
---
You could get naked before doing this stuff, I see you ve died a lot.
---
Also makes for a nice clickbait.
---
Unless your clothes make your character.. :D
---
Not the same argument. You’re talking about a group, I’m assuming. In which case I also buff AI (which takes mana and a reagent). 
---
Do people constantly run at you in the open world and open trade window without saying anything? Then they scoff if you were to say “25s per stack”. That is the very definition of entitlement, OP.
---
I know, I am one of those tanks. I was trying to make a point that the guy wont find a tank for his runs unless he gives him atleast 1 orb.
---
That guy is messing with you, they're saying "Watch your back."
---
The tunnel is the only standard way in. Otherwise.......you could have asked a Warlock to summon him in...
---
No at least one boss must be dead in the instance or else no raid ID is assigned. This is why trash farming pugs work.
---
It’s not about ruining your game play is about having their kind of fun
---
Well that's my point, a rogue shouldn't need more than the time you get in WotF.
---
i'm so torn and my druid has been sitting at 19 forever now.
---
i wanna make an alt i can 1) tank 5-10 mans for my guild and 2) raid heal for my guild.
---
I REALLY wanna play a plate char, although i know a druid would be the better option here.
---
Right???!??!?
---
Ah yeah so those are the only ways . I’m not sure why we didn’t do the swim thing I don’t think we realized how awful going through Felwood would be .. the first quest was simple even though the mobs were being farmed and we were being farmed by horde, but once we corpse crawled to the actual tunnel we couldn’t fight the mobs up there .. we are lvl 46 and 47 and there was too much competition for them . Thank you !
---
A little bit of that kind of stuff is normal, I remember being griefed 15 yrs ago. 
---
But only in WoW classic have I legit been camped by a 30 man raid, who was in same area 10 hours earlier and still a 30 man raid. Or more recently, dudes walking up to the hunter quest mob while I'm trying to do it, making it a point to attack the mob specifically first before ganking me to force it to despawn for 15 minutes.
---
I don't mean to get meta but although there are occasional dicks like that in every game, I feel streaming-culture sort of encourages this sort of behavior. Lots of people WANT to behave like this now, to a point where they go out of their way to mess with people because they have 3-4 peoole watching their 2 sub stream.
---
I know you don't want to here this but.....if you know you are going into blackrock, run there during an offtime and just log off somewhere close to the instance you want to do.
---
Aurastone + DM offhand without dps competition
---
God damn these threads never get old
---
   -someone who got made fun of for rolling on a PVE server this time around.
---
Ah, cool. Thanks :)
---
Reddit is just google but you wait for someone else to google it for you or you came here to argue with someone
---
Why wouldn't it be a good idea to post it in the discord?
---
[And then we have this guy at Sentinel Hill](https://i.imgur.com/xkj2BL9.jpg)
---
Ship's going down, lads.
---
I tanked ZF on both my warrior and druid at 43.  It's a huge pain in the ass to hold bosses but you should be okay on trash.
---
On my server alliance side, deviate fishes are worth 2x oily blackmouth. Head to barrens at the lakes near WC and enjoy the nice, safe, easy catches.
---
&gt; horde flustered because his 10 man gank squad can't help him win an argument
---
Why not take 10 fucking seconds before rezzing to look around? 90 percent of complaints in here are just people bad at the game.
---
Alright I might be good enough geared since I have all those items you mention or better like Ragnaros belt, onyxia neck etc.
---
Hmm we run onyxia with only one tank so I dont know actually what our plan is there.
---
Click the box in your raid profiles to show party (or w/e) it will show them by groups and force it to be in 5s. Definitely helps for buffing and group assignments. lol
---
Just what I thought. Not worth farming for whatsoever.
---
Strat UD is one of the more challenging choices you could make, since  almost every pull is either AoE or ranged enemies.
---
If you are looking for an easy way to level while farming items, I would start with DME, since you probably need the bow. After that, I would consider DMN, since it has a number of good items you will eventually want.
---
I am Horde on Benediction and it honestly seems pretty balanced.
---
I think the popular opinion is Crusader &gt; weapon chain
---
Therefore there are 2 gauntlets in the game that make you immune to disarm. The crafted Stronghold gauntlets and the Death Grips from undead strat
---
Lol at the min/max of reddit. No fun allowed! Sub is fun, enjoy!
---
Too true!!
---
why did you pick a pvp server with that attitude?
---
What does this have to do with anything? Roaming death squads still go for 48s the same as for 60s. Those roaming death squads are interested in honor. It takes 4 kills to deplete the value of a kill to 0. What are you confused about?
---
I thought respec costs were supposed to go down after a month without respeccing? My last respec was either on tuesday or wednesday (and I've been sitting at 50g for a very long time), but last night I only had to pay 45g. How'd that happen?
---
I played a warrior for 10 years and rolled mage for classic. I was nice and now I’m an asshole.
---
Sorry didnt know
---
I literally laugh my ass off when I see someone trying to sell a ring of saviors for like 100g. Absolutely fucking terrible ring
---
So no head?
---
Enhancement shaman here. What’s the fastest way to get from level 30 to level 40?
---
I don't heal warlocks unless they stand in chain heal range. They ain't the ones paying for my water.
---
Wait what build is that? I know of elemental 0/24/27 and frost 17/0/34 builds.
---
Bruh, just shut the fuck up. You get to choose your server, and this dude chose to play on the streamer server - he has no right to complain, therefore, about streamers. Stop getting offended for somebody else. Stop virtue-signalling for a few internet points.
---
My guild clears 10/10 MC and Onyxia in less than 3 hours... I never spend more than like 5-10g on consumables...
---
Amrican game alright
---
Spoiler: You are losing because you are bad, not because you are on an "unbalanced" realm
---
Uhm no just no I am horde and alli is 70 30
---
Boy are you in for a ride.
---
exactly, the offhand is one of the only items i plan on getting from AV rewards
---
Each run apparently took him 5-10 minutes, skipping trash and going straight to the dragons
---
Farm another one
---
Not even that. Some dude in discord just said, "he won't ninja it it would ruin his reputation." And by his own admission, this is what triggered him to do it. He says so explicitly.
---
Imagine being *that much* of a loser.
---
The Alliance had it coming for being alive where you were.
---
Except Doubleagent.
---
That's what I really enjoyed about the Elemental Plateau in TC and Wintergrasp in WotLK. You were auto-flagged for pvp in those areas, and they had resources that made them very valuable to farm, but the pvp brought a nice amount of risk and ability to fight over those valuable resources. I kinda wish I could fight members of my own faction though.
---
Also, flying mount usage at the edge of Wintergrasp did defeat the purpose of that a bit, and that wasn't ideal, but you get what I mean.
---
oooo good tidbit to add there....."DIDNT READ THE FINE PRINT"
---
tbh this spell sucks. no characters are actually invincible &amp; detecting greater invinciblity doesnt maker sense
---
I'd give wisdom to the healer and it always works out unless they start attacking things.
---
Bout to give everyone cancer https://imgur.com/a/VPPZ7fU
---
No I’m not proud of it.
---
Thanks! Will try on wednesday :)
---
Until you come across a boss with aggro reset.
---
I probably will level a shaman at some point for the enhance memes but working on a mage right now.
---
I mean, level 49 is only like 65% or something of the total exp needed to 60. IIRC, 42 or 43 is the "halfway" point.
---
Pretty sure being 60 and having good raid gear is going to be a lot more time invested and all that time goes out the window each time a new raid tier is released.
---
Thanks! Will try on wednesday. We actually have a feral druid that could tank haha
---
Guide or anything anywhere? Without walking onto the mobs i don't see how it can be useful
---
Good one forgot about that
---
Ganking the low levels is a little harsh imo.  No honor and no challenge to it.
---
Nothing really wrong with it.  That's how PvP se Vers work. I got ganked dozens of times and never complained.
---
Agreed on sparing the warriors though. They have it rough already.  I mainly target hunters, they need to learn what the graveyard walk is all about.   
---
I would go after warlocks too but I'm not suicidal!
---
Yeah DM one is Wayyyyyy better for hunters
---
Same for mages and warlocks and they really don't have any comparable option, unlike the Paladins who have a very near mace that is easily obtainable unlike the mage blade. If you want your raids to take longer and suffer for it by all means hand the mageblade to a paladin and watch all your casters gquit.
---
I already know a few people who are flat out stockpiling mats for that quest and have been since week one. It's gonna be ridiculous.
---
No way do I have the time, money, or willpower to do that. More power to those that do I guess. Certainly is a impressive testament to their resolve.
---
Oh yeah who doesn't know that karma decides the worth of us all. I have the same as you btw, so maybe think about that.
---
I am open of negotiations on that point.  A lot of healers I have been with do a fair amount of DPS on the side, which occasionally is an issue.
---
Honestly, if it takes you 30 days to hit 60, this might not be the game for you. That is...egregiously slow.
---
I've had a rogue stealth to the tunnel from the east entrance and target him. Works well. I've probably seen him 5 times in my 10 runs there.
---
Yeah I was saying this in another post. The better players aren't inherently toxic at all. We're just quite literally good at our class and we have a, in my opinion, reasonable expectation that everyone should know how to play their class in Classic. Everything you need to know to be decent at your class can be googled and learned in 15 minutes TOPS when it comes to a 15 year old game. But, yeah, that can definitely be considered toxic if you're in a group where you're the minority. Luckily, that's rarely the case.
---
Just wait until BGs.  If you're horde, find a priest buddy.  If alliance, find a paladin buddy.  Warriors are MONSTERS with dispels.  Priests and paladins are the best dispel healers and can provide you with massive support.  Your role is to first protect them, and then if you work up a rhthym and they see that you're protecting them they will start supporting you with tons of cleanses. 
---
Warrior vs mage when you have a healer / cleanse is a joke.  The mage can't sheep or frost nova without it getting dispelled.  If you're alliance and have blessing of freedom that's all you need!  Mages dominate warriors 1v1 but warrs get their revenge if they have support.
---
I think its called con roc witht the warrior plug in.  Its pretty good at giving you a basic rotation as you learn to play your class and it reminds you of things to keep active.  Get a swing timer and/or quartz.  Casting bars for classic.   
---
Playing a warrior right out of the gate is tough. I start3ed doing it but got annoyed....started leveling a farming toon(hunter)......when the hunter is around L50ish I'll go back to the warrior and let the hunter fund the warrior.
---
If the tank is honest enough to tell me hes new, I usually add him to my friends list then invite him to discord so I can walk him through the pulls.
---
It's rare to find players willing to admit their faults and i treasure every single one
---
How do you get names with class colors like that?
---
Pretty much this. But I often have a tankier set that doesn’t include disarm immune because honestly warriors die really fast and in larger groups people usually don’t disarm they’re more focused on sweeping strikes whirlwinding.
---
Yep! We've been able to handle loot issues almost without incident (always gonna be one or two people that didn't mature), everybody is polite and respectful (and tolerant of our sarcastic, cynical humor).
---
Overall, it's been a far more pleasant experience than it was back in the day, and I'm really enjoying it.
---
Rogues don’t use invisaibility, they use stealth you forehead.
---
Really...didnt know the gold increased
---
I want to be on a 50/50 server
---
He could OT UBRS just fine.
---
People do care though. People complain all the time here and on the forums that people reserve loot at all
---
If you do the quests it is very clear that the plague is intended to kill humans. Killing the Scourge is an excuse they make to placate the Horde.
---
the key here is people attacking skull and not AOEing.  Which people tend to do.
---
Im on a pve server. Yes they are same faction.
---
I still don't get how Alliance stand *any* chance of getting Azuregos on a Horde dominated server.  Isn't he at the doorstep of the Horde's *main* base?  How can the Alliance hope to summon enough people fast enough to even contest him?
---
I've straight up had tanks say this to me, so I 100% believe this.
---
The healcom 4.0 on curse works. Many frames have already integrated it into them.
---
You can also just download the addon and have it, but it won't show anything on its own, on the default frames.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libhealcomm-4-0
---
Gotta use those raid icons and communicate. Otherwise I’m DOTing up the whole squad
---
Taking a good paladin is always optimal! Much like shaman totems the paladin vlessings and auras are incredibly powerful. You can't have too many auras and blessings. But the other thing a ret paladin brings to the table is divine intervention. They can throw it on the healer to prevent a wipe. And if you also have a holy paladin they can DI each other giving you two wipe recoveries! Also Judgement of Wisdom and Light. What's not to love about a ret paladin?
---
Funniest thing is when someone asked about +1 loot system and I told him to just google it because he will not learn anything on reddit. So I googled it myself because I wanted to know too, and the 1st link and where the original post was made, you've guessed it, reddit :P
---
Yeah well we have been saying it even during the wall of no days.
---
Then you answered your own question?
---
I also have quite a clicky and slightly stiff mouse wheel, so it's a bit harder to accidentally hit it.
---
Oh well, I guess you just have to live with being able to farm 2k gold better than any other class in classic.
---
I've been alliance almost my entire time on retail, and I have a gnome mage alt to my paladin tank main. I have also played almost exclusively on pve servers.
---
And yet, I agree with you. Every gnome, yes, even mine, should be KoS. I mean, that little backflip they do, that wail they let out when they die... Maybe I have Gnomeragan PTSD...
---
Lol there are no dead servers.
---
Hey, that is what i thought. It is a pve server and we are same faction. This particular player is multiboxing 4 lvl 1s so he can see it everywhere.
---
You don't need flasks for raids, nor do you need to farm consumables for days. 
---
That said, if you joined a guild that expects people to put in the effort to improve individual performance and help clear content faster, you should put in the effort or join a more casual guild. I got all my pre-bis, enchants, pots, and sometimes buffs because I actually like my guild and want to do my best.
---
Not a bug though. That works exactly as it did in Classic.
---
There are better ways to farm honor. OP even specifically mentions that Rogues and Druids are higher on the standings than the Priests doing this.
---
Is there somewhere where o can see what level epics can drop from what level monsters?
---
Way to ignore everything mentioned that’s fun that you can do sub no lifer hours.  👍 Safe to say that, shockingly, there are lots of ways to have fun with this video game even if you aren’t a min/max elitist nolifer. Say it ain’t so! Some one call the press!!
---
there's a horde fp in Arathi as well as hillsbrad so you didn't have to walk all the way to undercity
---
Main tank will almost never get aggro on ony p3 until a lot of people die. Offtank needs to pick it up in p3 since he shouldn't of taken any fireballs and his threat is not reset.
---
If you’re in if don’t advertise jed.
---
If a server would be 50/50, alliance would decide that faction balance still is the reason after dying several times, transferring away and making it a 40/60 by choice.
---
Iirc you gotta make the raid group, but I could be mistaken
---
I spent about a week farming that tower every single day. Crusader never dropped. I dropped enchanting.
---
You are forced to release after 6 mins :)
---
As someone who appears in this screenshot I feel the need to explain why I was there personally.  I was in Kargath about to get a portal to Orgrimmar when I see if LFG chat:  LFM **PVP**  in EPL. I asked for an invite and flew over to LHC.  I arrived at LHC and noticed the whole group was chilling in town.  Assuming we were waiting for the last person still on route, I waited with my group.  10 minutes pass and I realise these guys aren't LFM to PVP, they just want to camp the flight path.  This is honor farming on Skeram right now.  It's not PVP, it's honor farming and it sucks.
---
Says the man that wrote 2 salty comments. Zzzzz
---
Clear. Thanks
---
Pretty sure private servers have far less to deal with because they don't go through as many anti-cheat mechanisms
---
Aight. Thanks!!
---
Good point, thanks
---
Yeah, I have to admit, it's rare that I come across people that truly have no idea what they're doing, AND won't accept directions and advice. Overall, my pug experience is far better than it was 15 years ago, and I'm grateful for all of you who took that 15 min to figure out how to play.
---
I still have mine from vanilla! That, along with the dungeon companion, are a huge help
---
thats the putting in effort part which is just negated

---
Ya had me until life tap. If you life tap out of combat and expect the healer to waste his mana and therefore gold healing you because you're lazy and don't buy food/water, you're wrong.
---
Will do that. Thanks!
---
I don’t think I’ve ever had a healer bandage me. Guess I’ve never had a good healer then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Do you know if shield slam is a huge advantage over tanks not using a deep prot build? Ive really considered keeping sweeping strikes for 5 mans.
---
Think this would be pretty light griefing , if even anyway considered what other people will do.
---
Dungeon Crawl.
---
Sincerely, was 53 at p2 golive, currently 57.

Luckily i'm a warrior so i can tank and have made healer friends, but i dont think i've done a quest outside since p2.

---
As an ele, your weapon doesn't really matter much. 40+ the DPS of weapons stops going up very much. You should only really be finishing off the last 25-30% of a mob with auto attacks at best.
---
Going forward, expect to be using maces since the best spell and healing power weapons from raids is going to be maces until at least P5.
---
So I can just use rank 1 wing clip to stand him in place without worrying about the fear?
---
Yes, it shows you their coordinates. Their exact location when they stealthed. The general direction in which they are
---
Great question!  Alliance.
---
It's not, but you can believe what you want.
---
I have a dedicated /startattack macro that I bind to 1. One hotkey short of optimal, but I consider the saved sanity of typing /startattack 30+ times more than worthwhile haha.
---
&gt; It is also a big gear/dps check
---
The first MC clear in classic was with 25 players still in greens.
---
What is this nonsense?  You just agreed with the main reason for why they run differently yet still want to compare.
---
It's fucking asinine
---
I envy you. I wish I was at home playing some warcraft. Stuck at work right now.
---
Get some levels for me my man.
---
Are we talking 30 days /played or 30 days playing for an hour or two each day? Big difference
---
There are tons of threat knock backs which is really rough on a pally tank. Also happens on Bosses that hit hard. The batman boss and the butcher will 2 shot a clothy. Paladins are easily the worst tanks in scholomance. It can be delt with but requires a higher level of performance from the rest of the group.
---
My experience is that healers are typically the nicer experienced players, while tanks are the more stern/dickish experienced players. All experienced players would be considered toxic by an inexperienced player when that player is causing more trouble for the experienced player. 
---
That being said as an experienced player, the most outright toxic people I've run into are 100% Mages and sometimes Rogues. Hunters seem to all be 40 year olds just high as fuck living their best life.
---
My belief is that there will never be another big private server is backed up by the history of blizzard's previous actions and the way business operates. 
---
Your belief is probably based on hurt feelings or misguided energy that needs a more creative outlet
---
Cool! Do u sell the cloth on AH then or just make bands and vendor sell them ?
---
Youre considering magic resists. Hes not using any magic. He's using engineery bombs and tools. So spell hit/crit/resist levels has absolutely nothing to do here
---
Do you play on a pvp server?  If so,  I highly doubt that 3 separated groups of 5 will be capable of holding their respective territory, especially if you are alliance and/or on a high pop server.  The competition for spawn points is going to be very fierce.  If you have 15 people I would say that holding one of the smaller caves in the southern hive is your best bet.  Generally I would suggest this based on the size of your farming group:
---
* 20+ people - above ground at the southern hive
---
* 10-20 people - southern hive below ground or the swarming pillar
---
* 5-10 people - western hive
---
* &lt;5 people - northern hive
---
Obviously these will not always be available and you often wont be able to get the spot you want and be forced to go elsewhere.  I'd try to follow these guidelines as much as possible though.  Another tip I would suggest is to seek out the top guilds on your faction and try to find a spot nearby then to farm(without encroaching on their territory).  There is power in numbers and you can each come to each other's defense if threatened by the opposing faction.
---
The idea is to grind the mobs at lvl 35 so you get the XP and gold you need.
---
Maybe you should learn the differences between invisibility and stealth
---
Wow that’s awesome to hear! I lived in SM from 26-43 as a priest and made a ton of friends there. Now we raid together and chill in discord. Classic has allowed me to meet some really cool people, love this game!
---
That's wrong, just compare different stuffs stats in wowhead.
---
As warrior you want to get flameguard gauntlets or Edgemasters so Devilsaur doesn't last. You'll replace BDS during BWL or with PVP items.
---
Healing a Warlock is the equivalent of doing damage as a healer. Your mana is effectively doubled or tripled when transferred to a Warlock. Your heals create a multiple of health per mana point spent. The Warlock than transfer that health into mana in addition to a 1.20x bonus gained if they have the near universally taken improved life tap. That mana can then be used to spam Shadowbolt, AoE abilities and multi-dotting, unleashing mad deeps. Otherwise they're stuck wanding and life draining while doing piddly dps.
---
Even the chromag claw, 24 spellpower and 1% crit are pretty close to each other.  Chromag's is probably slightly better, but not definitively.
---
Basically the same as it did in vanilla.
---
https://i.imgur.com/nWBvIJz.jpg
---
People who think this aren’t basing this on anything. For every horde dominated PvP server there’s an alliance dominated pve server.
---
What? Warriors have whirlwind.
---
What ui is this??
---
Scan the AH to see what its going for.  A number someone tells you on the forum is worthless if anyone is undercutting you by a large percentage.
---
Fine, then mages and warlocks shoueldn't roll on it while staff of dominance exists. Staff of dominance is closer to sword than aurastone is to sword. 
---
In short, your argument is stupid AF.
---
Ah, just found it. Thank you!
---
You parsed 89 DPS? Are you sure that's the correct number? As a tank I average (across the entirety of MC, including fights like Geddon/Shazzrah where I just range) something like 130 DPS. As a hunter, if you're pulling sub 100 you're literally AFK most of the fight, and since you have Rhok I know you have mechanics. I think there's an issue with the parsing.
---
You seem a little on edge today.
---
What race are you?  Do you use mana pots and runes? What pet?  Do you use an auto attack timer?

Rhokdelar is a 2.8 speed, so using the clipped rotation is ok. Just use aim shot as soon as its off CD.  But don't clip an auto for an aimed shot. Do you use rank 1 multi shot?  The extra mana isn't worth the extra dmg from max rank. Do you wait to start dps with all the others?  I generally start before other dps with a few autos and FD after my first aim shot if it crits, otherwise i wait after my first multi.  Wiping threat every 30 seconds means we don't have necessarily wait as long for the MT to generate threat.  Depends how anal your raid leader is though.   
---
You can start aimed shot casts before your auto shot animation goes off if you use a timer.   It'll look like your character doesn't auto, but the white damage will still show. 
---
Also the wind serpent pet will net you more personal dps than a wolf with furious howl.   Just make a macro to cast lightning breath and aimed shot and don't send your pet in.   It'll move up,  lightning breath,  and come back.   Alternatively you can put him in stay and hell stay max range after his first lightning breath cast.
---
So basically your comment was everything OP said lol
---
Because that was the point brought up, raid loggers.
---
They are more spread out on the other side, Alliance have to run through the chokepoint.
---
Imagine being Horde and complaining about Alliance.
---
Wpvp is like Dark Souls for Alliance and Hello Kitty for Horde.
---
We are alliance our fp is next to the small lake in the south , so a little farther but still very easy to find because of the landmark .. I was always super thankful for moonglade teleport cause if I have my hearth in Stormwind it’s really easy to travel cross continent , but I never realized how much of a pain it is to just get there in general !! If you do it the way you’re supposed to it’s so easy task lol
---
That what i love in Vanila, reputation is so important
---
You can use it to spot the eyes in Dire Maul (actually are those invisible?) and the shades in UD Strat!
---
K well you're just wrong
---
I already talked about paladins that no one will be making before you ever commented.
---
You will have that weapon for a loooooong time.  The staff from Nefarian is a clear upgrade, Claw of Chromag is probably a slight upgrade.  You won't find a big 1H upgrade until deep into AQ40.
---
I pally tank and mana is a non issue for me
---
I dont quite buy into this line of reasoning.  All of these factors were true of private servers and it still took about 4 weeks for the war effort to finish.
---
there is no ignoring anyone when you're fighting that many people. you're not going to remember anyone's name in zerg raids so no one is going to realize there's no honor in killing you until after your dead, if they ever do.
---
Heals generate half the threat damage does
---
u/asmongold
---
Not sure what your getting that at. The average person at lvl 60 has raid gear. Nobody cares about the people below 60 at this point.
---
Why would I want to have a wife or family of my own? Why do drones like you always think that is how we are supposed to live? I'm quite happy with my life that I can choose to spend my time on stuff like I want. Having a family is not the definition of a better life if you think so.
---
SGC is BIS until AQ40 for warriors..
---
That would make more sense imo. Then I would only be mildly unlucky, rather than the statistical anomaly that I am with a 1/6 chance.
---
Dont think so, I dont share the reddit mentality of crybabying about "ninjalooting"
---
Actually delusional
---
Bought mine last night. Didn’t even think of this. Fuck me.
---
We did that for 6 weeks of MC and finally we did a kick rotation and killed the adds in like 20 seconds (with 3 heals going through). 
---
With 40 people those adds are a joke.
---
You only need unfriendly for them to not aggro, so the grind isn't as  long as you may think, but yea, the death run is probably quicker for a one time trip through to moonglade.
---
This is including 60s I didn’t once mention levelers.
---
Got mine on my third arena run ever. It was glorious.
---
My own UI made by myself.Not finished yet need to add more stuff for tracking few buffs/debuffs
---
You need the threat talent. Guides will say "ahhhh you should be fime without it" and people that "know what they're talking about" will say "if you play right you shouldn't need it." But, but. If you talent it; ez mode swipe, charge groups for tanking services. Take it, seriously, all the try hards are lying.
---
&gt; Also the alliance humans are wanting to kill off the forsaken simply because they were cursed.
---
Look at all the horrible shit the undead are doing to the alliance in northern eastern kingdoms. It's definitely not 'just' for being cursed, they're fucking evil. Even in WCIII sylvanas makes the first move against the alliance when she betrays and kills Garithos after he helps her recapture Lordaeron and sure, Garithos is a monstrous dickhead, but the Alliance still clearly recognized that Sylvanas was different than the scourge AND worked together with her towards a common goal. There is little/no evidence that the Alliance ever rejected the forsaken as a faction before the forsaken decided to prove that they deserved it.
---
My roommate pally tanks and just found out he has his spell rotation all backwards and fucked up. He’s a god now for my AOE mage
---
Classiccastbars
---
There are a lot of keyboard turners out there bro :P
---
Fuckin mages....
---
Same with water breathing.
---
Nah it's more of a low-pop faction thing in general
---
OK. I See :)
---
It’s never taken me more than seven deaths to make it into BRM.  It feels miserable going in there, but people like staying for repeat runs more now
---
i often just sac a voidwalker for non raid content to be lazy,  the passive heal pretty much keeps you topped up outside of a few bandages/HOTs.  No need for max DPS in most small group content anyway.
---
PSA to healers, you don't need to heal a warlock who is at 95% after a downrank lifetap while running between fights.  We get 15 hp5 from demon armor, and overall regen rate when the lock is &lt;100% of both mana and hp is very good.  We can skip eat/drink if the fight ends with 100% health and 80% mana this way. 
---
Also don't need to heal undead who are cannibalizing, it's 35% hp bar regardless of total hp pool, so a double tap right after a fight probably means the undead intends to cannibalize.  As above, if the fight ends with 100% hp and maybe &gt;60% mana and there is a humanoid around, and with a lock with a large HP pool (esp once gear with tier 1/2, which is still a thing in pve when you're threat limited for spellpower anyway), it can be faster than eating/drinking to tap and cannibalize.
---
LOL no. 
---
The Nostralius  guys were "shut down" because they chose to comply with the cease and desist order that Blizzard sent out out of respect for the company. Blizzard always sends these out. They have to under American law in order to show that they are protecting their copyrights. But these servers are in countries where they don't have to comply. 
---
You can play on private servers right now. WotLK servers are the hot ticket these days but Kronos has been running Vanilla servers for years. The population there is low but maybe that's not such a huge issue with people with Phase 2 PTSD. Personally I can't wait for the [Classic Plus](https://old.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/ccxgd0/1121_first_vanilla_server_buffed_raids/) server that is supposed to come out "soon". There is also the Turtle WoW PvE RP server with some interesting custom features but very few people play there. I did go back to check out the [Player Controlled Mirage Raceway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pabpu7h5ISc)
---
Yes world pvp, why wouldn’t you respec? 
---
Meh if you don’t want to keep your main tank around, you do you.
---
Good luck getting your .2% drop when you could be grinding for the future, when you might have less time to grind and content requires things like flasks.
---
Since you can shift the frost CC I'd think that one is less necessary, but resisting some frostbolts never hurt.
---
A question to PvPing Hunters: What do you have keybound?
---
It seems that between the several spells you need both Rank 1 and max rank versions bound, Aspects, CDs, Engineering stuff, potions and misc. stuff like mount and water, there's not enough space.
---
Or more likely; there is enough space but I'm dumb.
---
On my pally w/ blessing of light and in healing gear my rank one cost 35 mana and heals for around 300. Warlock can make a lot of mana for a little of mine. It’s nice. Except when they sit oom and I’m like bro I’m a pally tap away.
---
It's the exact same thing.
---
AQ40 because that's when a ton of guilds disband after getting a reality check at cthun
---
Best answer on here. Take my silver.
---
Yes you can do it easily. Guilds usually raid for 4 hours 2 times a week, most only raid 1 day in p1-3, in p4 with zg guilds will do zg on off days or you can do it as a pug. Its about 2-3 hours depending on people. When aq hits guilds spend 1 day on mc and bwl and then the other day on aq, unless the guild is really good, then they might be able to get 1 hour in on aq the first raid day. I personally havent played naxx, but i doubt guilds runs mc or bwl when it hits (with the exception of garr and geddon). For naxx people has said you need a lot of consumes, so id recommend you start prepairing for it now (can make multiple bank alts to hold the consumes). If not you will have to spend a lot of time grinding gold between raids, atleast until you have naxx on farm.
---
20 hours is plenty of time to raid and pvp and farm consumes.
---
Mine works just fine....sometimes i have to relaod the game (/reload)
---
You can create a ticket. But recently I've seen posts from GMs that don't revert your lockout... But you can always ask.
---
Sorry parsed 89 as in 89%. It was something close to 400 dps.
---
All the way from thorium point until brd.
---
Thats what u think; Id like to moderate the content to my own liking
---
Any good gold farms for shadow priests?
---
How did you guys manage to get to BR?
---
Really? Because I saw Asmon run from TP to UBRS on his level one without dying on Herod Horde. Meanwhile, he tries to do that on a 60 on Faerlina and dies 10 times.
---
4 carapaces too, though? It's too outlandish
---
Go do SM armory to get ravager for low level farming. Then I would farm the hell out of SFK and stockpile the twink items for when bg comes out. Even selling now will make you good gold.
---
Mixed feelings here - yes it's better action than anywhere else, but that's because Alliance are dying out. They safespot hard and abuse the imbalance. They're also there every night from around midnight until 6-7am - with 3 lvl 1 alliance scouts (dummy accounts) - really intense behavior while farming the 1 of a 1:3 faction ratio. They're nice with their emotes but there's no doubt they're greedily farming the few alliance left on a dying server.
---
Q
---
That is a game mechanic, not lore.
---
Why I left my server, I might be back if there's any alliance left.
---
I ran Blackfathom Depths for those last few levels to 30. You can probably handle SM GY at 30, though you'll have a little trouble on the last boss. Luckily he's an easy kill if the tank dies midway because he likes to cast so you should probably be ok tanking it.
---
SM GY will take you to 32ish and you can start running other wings of SM at that point.
---
except when I'm AOEing i don't really need or expect any healing outside of HOTs so that's just fine.
---
All those problems sound like problems for people who don't really care about the game because they'd be 60 already if they did.
---
You can jump down into the lava below the npc. Either through the window or being feared into it like OP
---
Take some of our druids. Jesus Christ my guild has more druids in our raid than mages.
---
You’re right. Humans were meant to stare at a computer screen 12 hrs a day and have 0 social interactions and let the species die off. Clearly it works so well for you that you have to take to forums and Reddit to shun and gatekeep your precious video game because you’re ultimately a small petty person with severe mental issues. Not many people want to play games like you do.. and that’s totally ok, I’m here to defend the rest of us who have lives outside Azeroth.... or FFIV... or whatever other games you take to to hide from the real world.

I hope you get the help you need man

---
If I know I have time for some brd the next day, I just log out in brd.
---
Plenty of realms which allowed character transfers have completely died on the alliance side already
---
Sad that honor farming for horde on this server means grouping as 6-7 people running around Winterspring and camping a single person for a while, the honor you get from that is probably abysmally low
---
You dont need go talk to any npc, if you fall into the lava below the npc you get ported into mc. There are no prompts.
---
Depends on server size. Its a very small percent. Id guess the really popular servers will see two at a time.
---
Yes, I read the other answers, and everybody told you to get the helmet - instead you got the mount, which is the least useful upgrade possible for a casual player. You're not going to be using the mount that often in battlegrounds, and outside of them, not at all - instead of getting the always useful Lionheart Helm...you went with the marginally useful mount. That was a hilariously dumbass decision, one you're probably going to regret.
---
I mean, it did solve the problem of loot drama in retail.
---
Not that I think it's the correct solution. But it is *a solution*.
---
Ya know, in the same way that dying is a solution to debt.
---
I thought rag and majordomo were tough with coordination until I got to eye of c’thun....the coordination required in that fight is mind numbing lol
---
Classic might not be your thing, retail is always there for you I guess
---
Mmmm.  I know its patch 1.12.  Why not AB also?  I know the gear is on par with another phase...
---
To be fair, the layering fix was easy as hell to exploit. If they had ignored the community and fixed layering, it might’ve worked out.
---
We were kind of willing to do it too, but the mobs around our level were being farmed and then the opposite faction was farming the people farming the mobs LOL it was such a mess and like 2 am realm time .. I had no idea how it was so busy !
---
It honestly feels like much higher than that. I feel like it’s almost always up when I’m in a dungeon / raid.
---
Just to add to this deep prot is also the best dungeon tanking spec. With a shield you take less damage which means less healing so more chain pulls. You also can't use shield bash or swap to berzerker stance to pummel as fury so you can't interrupt trash and no stun hurts too. Cheaper sunder means getting threat on each mob on pull is easier and you can take 3/3 revenge or 2/2 taunt and it makes dungeons even easier. 
---
Fury prot is literally only a raid spec for max threat.
---
Read the whole definition.
---
If you are training mobs in order to kill someone of the same faction (and I assume this is the case, otherwise OP could simply kill scouts himself), it is griefing because there is no pvp-remedy.
---
What's lip and mcp
---
Vuhdo is all you need to be a great healer. Mouseover healing, easily customized, easily identify anything happening to anyone in the raid.
---
Free for all in those areas could be something interesting: maybe not everywhere but a place far from everything called "outlaw territory" where you can target everyone? could be a lot of fun!
---
Otherwise I thought about having multiple sub-group in a faction: you would select your allegiance and they would fight in PvP. A 70/30 server could become a 35/35/30 server and it would be way more fun for everyone.
---
&gt; I don’t hesitate to tell the group it’s my first time. I’d rather be kicked up front if it’s going to be an issue for anybody.
---
I really hope no one is kicking or complaining about anything being someone's first time. That is a problem I experienced several times in Retail, because there everyone is leveling up alts, and all the dungeons are old hat boring to them. But here, in Classic, I'm hoping no one is so jaded already that this kind of thing is a problem.
---
If Classic is full of jaded players from Retail, then this game will start to suck.
---
It's been solved on PvE servers
---
I’m currently leveling a rogue alt. I’d do alchemy and herbalism. People do mining for gold. Since you’re a mage and have a bunch of different gold farms I’m sure this isn’t an issue. 
---
As a rogue you definitely use health potions not having to pay for those would be huge, also other potions that increase agility and other stats are no joke for a pure melee class.
---
Funny story:
---
Because warlocks have no spirit and a actually take a talent that specifically reduces it, and water is just a buff to mana regen, which spirit buffs
---
A healer can drink to full almost twice before I can drink to full *once*.
---
So I don't want hear it when I ask for a measly 10% of your mana to Pop me to full from post-pull tapping. It's actually faster for you to drink than for me.
---
After experiencing BRD with a prot pala, going back to a warrior tank sounds horrific if i was to level another char.
---
Honestly, prot palas fucking rule BRD
---
Only rogue going invisible is with a potion or his gnomish cloaking device. TO better detect rogues try breaking out your Felhunter.
---
Its great for healers.
---
I guess because blizzard is trying to keep things interesting by trickling content. Makes more sense to just release all the bg’s at the same time to me too.
---
I just grind shit outside of dungeons. There's a video out there of a shadow priest killing princess with no armor too tho
---
When was this taken I remember see you guys outside if the other day.

Good.

&gt;Blizzard isn't against griefing behavior when there's a PvP remedy (**if you can get together a group of allies to trounce the offending party or simply kill all the mobs quickly**, the problem is solved), but when the griever is impossible to attack (is not set PvP, or is of the same faction as his targets), there is no such PvP remedy.  
---
There is a remedy.
---
By the end of vanilla they added battle matters to major cities to allow players to queue easier. But that's what im saying. People generally aren't gonna be flying out to wpvp during queues because that means they'll have to fly back to town to requeue when their bg is over.
---
Weirdly this is how it feels to be leveling as a 48+ as Horde on Gehennas.
---
Atleast 3-4 groups of 5 alliance prowling every leveling zone.  
---
Huge deathballs in front of Dire Maul
---
BRM is 50/50 contested usually.
---
I guess it's just confirmation bias ;)
---
The dominant are busy killing the alliance, who then get a chance to post on reddit waiting for their respawn timers.
---
Open world mob farming? Various elementals for their valuable drops. Plain dungeon running if you can find someone to run with. DM:E jump runs or Strat Live orb farms are the two good ones I know of.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
Its completely up to you. Id highly recommend engineering if your goal is to pvp, since it gives you a massive advantage. But you could always level up with gathering professions to make money and swap later if necessary! :)
---
We disenchanted one last night :(
---
No, no. Just the Alliance. Horde will be left killing the few Hardcore Alliance players left while the vast majority of regular players have completely abandoned the game and servers.
---
Horde will remain, Alliance are hemorrhaging.
---
Thanks)
---
If the group roams around ganking people but then has to move back to queue for the next BG because they don't get tp'd back to the battlemaster then they probably won't roam.        
---
Would also require for all to be in range of the battlemaster when the leader queues though.
---
Not a PvP hunter, but a pve warrior. Have you considered having both max rank and rank 1 on the same button, I have it set up that way on my mage so that if I hold shift it casts rank 1 of the spell. It's something like
---
#showtooltip
---
/Cast Blizzard
---
/Cast [mod: shift] Blizzard(rank1)
---
Or something along those lines. Also just in general using alt/shift/ctrl along with other buttons drastically increases the amount of keybindings you have available
---
Sometimes when people are making life changes they need a little reinforcement.
---
No one is ever going to do this for you. You have to go the trial and error of failing and fucking up and dealing with shitheads who think they're better than you if you want the rewards of being the leader.
---
So it's a PvP thing. Sigh. PvP problems ruin PvE.
---
Exactly what I was about to say.  I just watched this episode last night.
---
I would agree with you that it's fine to post this trash if he didn't try to pander and grift for money
---
Consider it is also very early and the coming gear power increase favors warriors. Wait until you get decked out, spec Arms and get a sick 2H'der. The gap will close.
---
Yikes, someone is super salty today lol
---
lol yeah seems like every MC run there's someone that gets knocked off the bridge and into the lava, and we always summon them out before they die. 
---
Also I didn't know warlocks can summon themselves, but I guess it makes sense since the other day I told a friend I needed a summon while we were in a full raid group, just as a joke, then helped him summon myself and took the summon which moved me like a yard.
---
Imo only impale prot or Fury prot are worth your attention. If you don't feel safe as Fury prot, go impale prot. There's no instance in any raid in classic where a impale prot is in danger of dying if everyone is more or less doing what they should. The other benefit of going impale prot is the fact that you itemize similarly to Fury prot, so if you want to switch it's real easy. Both builds basically want as much crit as they can get without sacrificing too much defensive stats. For example, Savage glad chain is definitely BiS for both build.
---
ye, its kinda of a comon mistake. theres nothing ull need from ah, gear wise, that u cant get from normal questing and dungeons.
---
Buying gear from the ah is rly more when u have a established main with good gold income and then yes, get cool stuff for alts...like me wasting 200g on a shadowblade for my rogue that will probb only last me till im lv30 or so :D
---
Weird, because everyone I speak to feels like there's a huge Alliance imbalance.
---
Probably due to all the try hard guilds trying to rank up, but levelling as horde right now is awful.
---
I went on two full MCs and four Ony kills, got no loot, and haven't been invited to a raid in two weeks. I definitely get that loot priority is a thing but this felt like just being used.
---
Don’t come to blauxmeau it’s like 90/10 horde
---
With mining you can solo jump runs pretty easily and get a chance at arcane crystals on the 3 rich thorium nodes at the end.
---
Anboni made a good guide on this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzvr3HD5HcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzvr3HD5HcE)
---
Last time I checked this earth has enough humans already. Don't need additional off springs of people like you.
---
Man guys like you love to feel superior because you followed the stuff your parents brain washed you as a child. You can have an active life, and successful job without wasting your time and money on a family. I prefer to spend my money and time on hobbies I actually like. And not on stuff a partner dictates you to do and your friends want you to do. I know it's hard to understand for drones like you, but you can choose to do whatever you want in life. You don't have to follow the same thing as your parents and society wants you to do.
---
So yeah have fun yourself I guess. But beware that your wife doesn't find out you played 5 minutes longer than she allowed you!
---
&gt; which leads to terrible gold per hour 
---
You're gearing a twink. It's not about GPM... Or you're doing it wrong.
---
Healers tend to see everyone's good side. No body wants to piss of the healer, idk why. Shadow priests see everyone's true colors lol. I'm not shadow and I get honestly annoyed at them the quickest. No you have no fucking right to roll on Tier 1 priest gear as shadow, it's not an upgrade. You're rolling shadow for pvp and you're trying to have your cake and eat it too while raiding as full shadow. Lost my tier 1 shoulders to a shadow priest pug last week because the raid leader didn't know the class and just let all priests roll but was quick to say shaman gear is healer only and enhance can't roll. Funny...
---
Never heard of that one. "Why drink free water instead of paying for bandages?"
---
Weird. Mind you I'm the healer in the equation, and it's always healer vs warlock when there's issues on that front. So I haven't heard it because I'm not stupid enough to think it I guess.
---
The servers have way to many people on them. Cap should be around 5K per server
---
Shadow can do full mars runs easily.
---
you can jump out the window next to the blood elf
---
I think that's because exact range didn't exist in vanilla, and was purposefully broken in the current client. So, it either wouldn't work for one reason or another even if it was unintentionally brought over with the new client.
---
So good it doesn't matter to me.
---
Roll PvE for your next char and you'll be happier overall.
---
I mean, you can do Mara Princess runs as Shadow super super super easily
---
What PvP gear are you referring to? Like, the pvp ranked gear?
---
Or is there a "BiS" for pvp priests?
---
this is 1000 percent lies. fuck you
---
Hey warlock. You're already king, stop complaining!
---
Unfortunately no. Mages can do a 3 and 2 packs pull cause of ice block but I don’t think priests can do the same.
---
That's always the way debates like this are. Perspective helps.
---
Like someone going from "I pull to speed things up" to rolling a tank alt and realizing why tanks hate that.
---
7 sp is nothing to sneeze at.  The over/under (50% chance) on getting it is 200 runs , at after 400 you have 73% chance of getting it.
---
I wouldn't bother now with AV coming, but I can understand someone with a lot of time on their hands and every other piece of BIS going for it.
---
I've been getting rolled by different groups of 5 alliance every 5-10 minutes in Un'goro as Horde on Gehennas.
---
Grass isn't always greener, I guess.
---
Hunter probably has the biggest arsenal of tools out of any class. As a result unless your mega pro you simply can't manage all the keybinds for all the abilities. There is room for everything if you place the lesser important spells (tracking etc) into macros. I'm at work, so don't have access to my current layout etc.
---
Can multiple people complete Quel’Serar in a single Onyxia?
---
Same with Herod. There are a ton of people who are never coming back.
---
shadowfang keep has two awesome 2 BOE weps, shadowfang and assassin's blade,  that can drop. Depending on your server, they can be sold for a lot.
---
I'm shocked more people dont know you can summon yourself, that's lock closet 101
---
&gt;When you reverse ingeneer something their I zero chance you end up with the exact same implementation. 
---
Never claimed the contrary.  
---
&gt;legal and security constraint which add obligation on blizz side which doesn't exist for pservers. 
---
Doesn't matter for actual gameplay calculations. There are no legal and security factors in calculating the result of a spell hit.  
---
&gt;offload a lot of the calculations to clients 
---
This is still 100% wrong and made up bullshit on your side.  
---
&gt;how difficult it is for them to do so 
---
It should be easy. It all comes down to how competent the decision makers are, and to whether they want to invest any money. The answer to the latter is probably no, because short term money &gt;&gt;&gt; everything.
---
Might be a silly question but do you 1H + Shield or 2H? What's the talent tree look like early on? I'm guessing part of it is getting straight to Conc?
---
&gt; vs all the other things you could be doing
---
It's certainly the last thing you want to do, but you could easily have farmed every other piece of BIS by now if you started at launch, or even a month after launch, and still have a life/fulltime job, etc.
---
That looks a lot better than the crap I just unwrapped and ate.
---
it’s funny that people think they can find good information about this game from google nowadays. all you get from google is shitty profit driven clickbait spam drafted by someone who doesn’t play the game or even speak english. it’s not like you just google elitist jerks forums anymore. the icy veins and classic wowhead guides are utter trash and full of information and exist only to sell adspace.
---
Because that's a dumb argument.
---
Obviously if you just don't like the genre the game is in, you won't think its one of the best gaming experiences.
---
I hate cleansing diseases in dungeons as Shadow Priest. Have to drink all the time already due to mana issues and while the mana cost of Abolish Disease is trivial, casting it forces me to drop/reapply Shadowform.
---
I'll still do it, but I'll hate having to do it.
---
If you have a priest they can mind vision from mob to mob to where he spawns and then look for him.
---
That means horde has 50% more people than alliance. That’s huge
---
need something to do while in queue you got me
---
It's not all good, but it's nice people care enough about the game and that there's actually social interaction no?
---
Classic really makes you enjoy finding a good group to hang with.
---
That's the thing I don't understand. If you roll on a PvP server and played vanilla you already know it's gonna be a crap shoot for leveling so why complain about it.
---
If you didn't play vanilla, it's still a PvP server and people are buttheads. It's to be expected unfortunately so why complain?
---
With rank 1 wing clip he just get slowed, not rooted. And yes, using rank 1 wing clip negates the fear mechanic. Imo this is the easiest way to do the boss.
---
You get placed in a raid automatically, but you do have to be at a main city or altered to queu up
---
It depends on how much its selling on the AH for and how much patience you have either way. On my server the cloth isn't much above vendor price so after the AH cut you really don't make more than just vendoring it. In that case it's definitely better to make them into bandages for the marginal increase in money. That is assuming you don't mind going AFK while you make a shit ton of them.
---
My favourite  line “sexualizing our children” lol
---
for those of you who play on high pop realms with queue times and use remote to log in
---
how do you stay logged in without disconnecting? iirc blizzard checks for activity so if you just jump in stormwind it'll disconnect you
---
does scanning the AH work for this?
---
It could be that they weren't impressed with your performance, or don't need you - so they haven't invited you to another raid.  You're probably doing the right thing by looking for a new guild.
---
Let em all go to hell except for cave 76!
---
Also I feel like people treat me differently depending on my gear. I used to get complimented all the time on my great healing. Then I got Benediction. Now they just expect me to be a great healer. I FEED ON YOUR COMPLIMENTS PEOPLE. TELL ME HOW GOOD I AM.
---
That's not true lol. I had this happen on my alt last week, no bosses dead and it was saved. Iirc the way I had it happen was while our raid was forming I was in MC, then logged off for a little bit, and then on log back in it was saved to an instance ID without clearing anything
---
That’s just false.
---
No they aren't and you can PvP just as much on a PvE server. You can also level without worry. It's just better.
---
I don't know what your problem is. As a tank, YOU have the power. 
---
If some dipshit dps tries to get funny with me when tanking - he goes on ignore and gets replaced. They need you more than you need them. There is a chronic shortage of tanks, at least on our server, and people should be grateful that YOU take this role upon yourself. 
---
And even if you get kicked from a group - you will be in a dungeon within minutes while the previous group will search for another tank for another 30+ minutes.
---
Hate you :-(
---
Why unarmed?
---
My guild has done the same thing when we’re short on members, so I totally get it. That’s awesome that you got to join up with them after though
---
no, layering is not the solution. faction queues is
---
Is this your first mmo?
---
You've never meet someone who's tired of current meta/balance patch in a shooter/moba. Done their ranked climbing for the season. Or just waiting for the next champion/weapon/hero/god/character/etc to be released?
---
I don't have 25 days played in classic, but I've been grinding my priest and I saw my 1st random epic boe this weekend.
---
Sadly it was Robes of Insight so it was trash, but I still got one!
---
I don't think you understand this game at all. Lol
---
&gt;yes vanilla raid mechanics aren’t hard. that’s not the point. 
---
Then what is?
---
Like I'm totally fine with you saying classic has an overall better experience through RPG-like mechanics, a better environment for community interaction, and a robust leveling experience.
---
But to even try and say that classic raids are anywhere close to retail on any category is just bad faith.
---
Yeah, balanced by the 4 consecutive runs I did where zero dropped.
---
I like it clean:
---

---
It's worth between 60 and 100 spellpower if you can get the shield to hold for healers. Getting that shield to hold in raids would be tough, but you can always swap it out for your other healing rings when the shield breaks.
---
I would be quite happy as a healer to acquire that. Admittedly, shamans value Mp5 more than any other healer.
---
Seriously I asked like 3 times in an UBRS run,and never got any water.  Like, really?
---
Honor spy counts of actual active players at high levels have the server at somewhere like 60:40 alliance favored actually.
---
there is only one group of people on the video. thats not gonna happen on big servers. that's the point
---
Yeah Kings is BiS but if threats an issue salv
---
Had to go horde for classic cuz palas make already easy raid content even that much more of a joke
---
And they steal my mageblade :(
---
If you're online and avaliable for the raid, you should earn full DKP even if the raid is already full and you don't get invited in.
---
Any guild that doesnt award DKP to members on stand by is probably abusing the DKP system to keep their inner circle at an unfairly high amount of DKP.
---
You can't see enemy buffs without using detect magic, a mage skill.
---
wow that's a fucking blunder. I guess the 3rd OT better step up to become the MT for a long while lol.
---
You make 20g/hr sitting in org as a mage? From what, just making portals/water/food for people? That’s pretty crazy if so.
---
spy only alerts you that a rogue is near. it doesnt actually let you see them to knock them out before their opener
---
Layering was not a solution, just a temporary bandaid until the tourists left.
---
The tourists did not leave, they moved in. Blizzard removed layering anyway.
---
Layering is unfortunately a more authentic vanilla experience than what the high pop servers have right now.
---
20 runs? Those are rookie numbers
---
&gt;Your faction is doing the exact same thing, just elsewhere. And you don't experience it because it's people from your own faction.
---
The main issue, at least on my server is that alliance cant contest important objectives because regardless how many we bring more will come.
---
How do I get the group number listed above the group!?
---
Arms absolutely gives you higher threat generation while leveling. At 60 fury/prot gives you more threat gen than deep prot unless you have no idea what you're doing, while giving you a higher rage generation. There is exactly zero reasoning for going deep prot in Classic other than "Shield slam is fun". You can get all the necessary prot talents for defense and threat gen in ~20 points.
---
Do you know if a Warlock can do this farm?
---
click gehennas and then click last 14 days
---
I could see this being possible however what helmet would you replace it with? 
---
18 strength, 2% hit and 2% crit are insanely high values for a helmet to have.
---
It is funny that the PvE servers replicate the Alliance-Horde situation more lore-accurately than the PvP servers.
---
I like to distract (rogue ability) people off the dock in Booty Bay. Especially funny when the boat leaves seconds after they fall.
---
Hah, enjoy your bath, Alliance scum.
---
I remember last night there was a lvl 47 alliance hunter questing in searing gorge. Throughout the entire hour he was killing mobs, about 200 horde ran past him. Many like myself stopped to investigate, but upon seeing his level we decided to come back later to see if he dinged.
---
It was a fascinating experience. Sure one group doing it makes sense, but there were literally 100-200 horde that passed through the area and many by him and no one attacked him. And he had the balls to be killing mobs right in the main thorium point to BRM run.
---
There was also a lvl 53 warlock with a 3 man honour guard. I tried to get him a couple times but he managed to LoS me and his buddies nailed me.
---
It was a neat experience.
---
Fire Res is more of a luxury thing, mainly used for Lava Packs because they it exceptionally hard and usually 5-10 people die per trash pull depending.  Ragnaros is generally done just using max DPS gear with Greater Fire Prot Pots.
---
AV exalted is like 12-20 hours, you’d have to be really casual for it to take a few weeks. There is never a time where you’d use polearms, there’s always a better option. It’s just not viable because of how imp polearms fucks your talent tree
---
Are you sure it boosts poison damage? I'm pretty sure spell damage doesn't affect poisons.. i know you can apply shadow oil to your weapons and that does benefit from spell damage though
---
Just don't. Why sacrifice the obvious advantages a mage offers for stupidity? You should convince your other pally to roll warrior or hunter or maybe even druid or rogue. You'll be much happier with a team that compliments each other than a team of singular weaknesses.
---
If you want to cycle it with one button, it should be:
---
/equip [mod:shift,noequipped:Lorespinner] Lorespinner; [mod:shift,equipped:Malistar's Defender] Big Iron Fishing Pole;
---
/equip [mod:shift,equipped:Lorespinner] Malistar's Defender;
---
If you need more space, you can search for macro length extending addon or (less convenient, but easier way) attach a lure manually :)
---
I'm just saying, I have little interest in BC.  I played in Vanilla, but didn't raid much.  I wanted to go back to Vanilla with Classic for that reason - complete all the things I didn't in Vanilla.  I think there was a lot of interest in Classic for that same reason.  Like a second chance to "beat" the game you didn't 15 years ago.  I accomplished all I wanted to in BC.  I just don't see the appeal of reliving every expansion at this point.  If they choose to just stick with BC Classic, I highly doubt I will go back.  I raided all the content in BC, I didn't like the PVP system, I didn't like the stat progression, and I didn't like the lore like killing Illidan.  It was my favorite expansion with that said, but I lived it fully.  I think a lot more people did with BC than Vanilla.  I just don't see it capturing the same nostalgia especially because you can go to the Outlands in any expansion as it was untouched by later expansions.  Can't say the same for Vanilla.
---
join us! both sides have twink guilds from og vanilla/privates willing to que up against each other and have fun (no 5 caps ab etc)
---
This is what i have been doing. Deep Prot with threat gear. Lionheart Helm, Onyxia pendant and things like this. Only boss that has been an issue whatsoever is Onyxia for threat. The DPS seem to ride the threat hard on that one. I just love the Deep Prot play style too much to spec away from it. Something about slamming my shield into a mobs face just does it for me.
---
I’m not fully familiar with it myself as I don’t care to involve myself in this kinda stuff but I know it’s happening. 11 people on my server Mirage Raceway have just all logged the EXACT same honour for two weeks running.
---
Last week all 11 had 55482 honour and now this week 51770 (All done within one days worth of farming as they weren’t being picked up before this).
---
It’s such a scummy way of boosting honour.
---
I think you missed the whole point of the post lol. He knew the ring wasn’t good, but seeing the purple made him Instinctively want it.
---
XD
---
It's a different environment than 15 years ago. The odd PvP or gank happened in the world. Random battles would break out. Today everyone is out for blood and are farming for honor.
---
Maybe it was just my server back in the day, and I was lucky. But today's classic although is the same game, feels like a different one.
---
48 Warlock (this will be my second 60)
---
* Intended raid/play times (with timezone) - Weekdays evenings, 6pm EST or later.
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc) - Mostly Raiding/PVP/Social
---
* Any pertinent rules (such as your loot system, or any code of conduct) - Prefer open roll and guild only but flexible.
---
* A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application) - PM
---
In some cases I don't think that would be possible. 
---
Corpse run in Un'Goro can be upwards of 4 minutes, as soon as you a res - another group has rotated ontop of you.
---
Numbers are not double, that's a complete fallacy.
---
Even at 5 AM server time, I can /who any zone and see less Horde than I can count Alliance camping my body.
---
I like to resurrect my warlock buddies demons when they sacrifice them. They have all started instantly summoning another demon to make the corpse disappear so I don't get to do it very often anymore... It's fun when I group with a warlock that doesn't know me!
---
Yeah you go on recommending that till the servers are dead and the only person you have to play with is yourself.
---
Again, you cannot drop combat with the gnomish cloaking device.  It used to work but it was hotfixed on Nov 12.
---
You're complaining
---
Do not listen this guy. He has no clue what hes taking about. Horde controls every zone and FP camps. It is ridiculous the amount of Horde there are on this server.
---
I mean, if you're doing it right, Jed is a 100% spawn
---
Thanks for the info.

Oh how one letter changes the whole meaning
---
You could have. You didn’t. Enjoy.
---
If youre on the classic wow forums asking about the war effort and scarab lord, you will not be getting it.   There are people stockpiling mats since week 1.   Heck, my server Skeram has people transferring mats to ally alts from horde mains because its like 90%h 10%A and don't want to have to wait for ally to turn in.    Sorry to be the bear of bad news.
---
I was 52 when p2 went out. Lived in BRD until 57 and got to 60 from LBRS /UBRS. Only leaving to cities to restock.
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just like, your opinion man.
---
On arms fully agree while leveling. For the 60 low geared level I read that prot/arms would beat fury/prot, but never played a war before. So do you go dual wield and all the crazy dps gear (leather) at pre raid items already?
---
You are spreading lies. Horde had control of Morgans vigil.
---
Sweet, yeah I figure it’ll take some getting used to but having to reset or die because of bad resist rng is so frustrating. I’ll take a look at those vids, thanks!
---
I did it in P2 on a high pop server, it's possible but honestly a lot of it comes down to luck. You kinda just have to hope there's no enemy players there ready to mess you up, hope that no friendly players try to "help" and mess you up, and of course hope there's no other hunters trying it also. Naturally you should try and do the quest at off peak times. I sat at my PC with my Switch and just played Zelda whenever I was waiting for people to leave the areas. 
---
I only got help from 1 guild warlock for the silithus guy, but that's it. You don't need a team of people to do it. You also don't need tonnes of buffs and consumables, just some bandages and mana, maybe some ago pots since they're cheap. 
---
If you're getting really fed up of getting ganked doing the Steppes guy, there's a strategy you can Google which involves using a tree which makes the fight very trivial, reduces the chances of someone messing it up. For Silithus, don't bother with the kiting method, bring a warlock to duel and put recklessness on you and use rank 3 wing clip, GG. Un'Goro and Winterspring are straightforward. 
---
Good luck!
---
Must VC
---
Back during summers when we would spend hours just hopping around Org or dueling we would have races to AQ from Org with no mounts, good times.
---
Truth. Not a bad plan. I'm actually levelling a warrior now (was running brd as a shaman), and will probably just tank arena/anger runs from 53+ as prot and put sgc on rez. Should probably take 500+ runs to get to 60 that way so maybe I'll see it then! Hahaha
---
&gt;I'm currently using strikers mark (got it in pug before i joined a guild).
---
Every melee in that run probably hates you now. Good job on rolling on a terrible bow for hunters.
---
You don't get #1 by only killing sub 60s so idk why you made this thread

Retails is really based around archetypes, like rDPS, mDPS, tank and heals.

mDPS = Orc Rogue
---
rDPS = UD Warlock
---
Tank = Human Warrior
---
Healer = NE Druid
---
How is not getting invited to raids (that I'd love to be in) the same as not wanting to work for gear?
---
Do like everyone else and drink/eat when you're out of mana/health. Or don't complain if you start a fight at 25% hp and die to random aoe.

I believe I've read a Q&amp;A about this before and they are not planning to change any details of the door opening requirements.

if only we had a channel, something like /world, where we could regularly see update about the PvP situation around BRM, winterspring, un'goro and such...
---
OP might be from EU, on US servers I always post raid consumes Tuesdays before raid times.

Horde on Heartseeker.  I've quested in WPL and EPL.  Felwood and Blasted Lands.  Briefly in Un'goro.  This is not the case.  Currently 56 and a disc priest.  Not exactly a heavy hitter yet I'm able to keep progressing and turning in quests.  You have to know when to go, where to go, how to stay out of sight, and not irritate the locals.  If you are hostile to everyone, no wonder people are after you.  I'm occasionally questing in sight of Alliance and I'm not bothered.

Work on your visibility.  Don't sit in the open, find cover.

Currently re-reading on my phone.

there would have to be a guard there to avoid (and you can be hit through that tarp)

I left LHC and went to farm Firewater ... thinking it’s early, maybe it will be possible. We actually had the village when I arrived (3 of us).
---
30min later Mishkka showed up with a hunter, then with a shaman, we killed them twice, maybe 3 times (2v2 and 3v2). 10min later we were corpse camped by 6+ all the way back to Everlook. Rezzed in Everlook to vendor. Killed in Everlook. Lmao. Farming time over.

At least he stopped sitting on a FP. I’d sign a deal just for that...
---
At what point of the ragnaros encounter do you pop the FPPs?  How many should I require per attempt (Going on my first guild run in 15 years this week and I believe we 1 shot rag most of the time).
---
I understand it's a common complaint, but it's a bullshit one that can be solved very easily by just communicating with your server community.
---
The question isn’t really what helmet to replace it with, but what hit gear. Ony Neck/Onslaught/Accuria (fury will never get, but tank or pvp prio) allow you to gear for a lot more stam. Don Julios is another nice hit piece coming out soon. 
---
In pvp: r10 helm, crown, t2 are all better in a lot of situations right now. 
---
In pve: a lot of good warriors are already dropping hit by using BDS set because we have too much. You can expect to see this be the trend for all of classic. Depending on other gear t2 helm and HoER are viable replacements for LHH.
---
Not even close, you don't dps shit in aoe as fury tank
---
Honest question, what did you guys expect? We knew they were going to enable honor before the introduction of BGs, and we knew how the honor gaining worked. I mean, did you exepct people not caring about kills and pvp rewards?
---
I assumed they meant a raw sausage, you know, the type you have to cook before you eat it, salami won’t gain anything from being in a pot for two and a half hours!
---
Since berserking is based on your hp you can use ItemRack to take off all your stam gear and then re equip just before pull to lower your hp before using beserking.  Can also pop a dark rune to get a little more of a buff before using it as well.  Def a min/max strat that isn't necessary,  but i enjoy doing it lol. 
---
The level 51 wind serpent in sunken temple that pats the back side of the lower ring has three highest rank of lightning breath currently available.   Easy enough to solo tame.

I wouldn't say heartseeker is dead, but I play a PI priest so I don't do a ton of PvP. I'd imagine it's dead for people who do.

Lol @ the action bar
---
Sinister Strike mode, engage!
---
Oh totally understand that from coordinating leveling with others. I'd suggest a non-grindy killing method to farm when they can't play so you don't out level them. That means either keep mining and just farming ore (not the best money til you can do rich thorium) which at your level you're not going to make the best money since you'd need to go to higher level zones.
---
You can maybe try fishing since you can find spots to fish without killing. Will take quite awhile to get where it can make money, but plus side is you won't outlevel your partner. Think there's some YouTube videos to show how to make money from it. Just a warning be prepared to watch some Netflix or something while you level fishing. It takes awhile e

Point level: missed

Wow must be nice. I had a this one guy be such an asshole to me in raid chat that I literally quit wow that day. I don't need the abuse. lol.

The gimmick will get old after you realize how slow pally DPS is.

Macro help: I have a macro for Nature's swiftness -&gt; Healing Wave that looks like

\#showtooltip Nature's Swiftness

/cast Nature's Swiftness

/cast Healing Wave

I feel like it works with a single push sometimes but others it wont go off. Am I missing something? This is much simpler than some of my other macros and yet it isn't working as well.
---
Does shit threat because you can't be in def stance, only hits 4 target every 9 seconds. Warriors are way behind.
---
It's definitely possible, but I need to think about what goes where. I will most likely have to group both Arcane Shots (though do I really need max rank Arcane Shot?) and both Multi-Shots around the same button.
---
Something like:
---
Auto-Shot and Aimed Shot around 1
---
Arcane Shots and Multi-Shots around 2
---
Stings around 3
---
Traps around 4
---
Melee around Q and E
---
Aspects in scroll wheel
---
Misc stuff, tracking (maybe), Engineering stuff and potions somewhere. Grouping things like this should give me enough space.
---
Then I just need to memorize the mana costs of absolutely everything.
---
Dragons are dragons, but the Chromatic dragons are both your dream and nightmare.
---
"Majority" is the key word here. Not all.
---
herod alliance are fine. join blood legion or tempest and get out there and farm horde. they've been owning us all over
---
Its not supposed to be impressive but how else are they going to climb. You're being farmed like furbolgs in winterspring.
---
And kicks are free on retail.
---
A rogue kick in classic cost 25 energy.
---
Either you are interested in pvp and gank yourself, or you aren't and these honor points are worthless to you anyway.
---
Not stressed about World PvP?  You're horde, what is there to stress about?
---
Ditto. Had a level 51 priest on PvP when P2 hit. I got maybe half a level on rested XP before I rerolled PvE.
---
I'm actually kinda pissed bc Blizz implied they'd release P2 at the end of the year, was planning on hitting 60 right around now. But I'm not even going to log on until after P3 drops
---
Can confirm, RP realms generally have given me more positive social interactions than negative ones. If you opt alliance nd pve realm hit up Bloodsail Bucaneers. I also heard Grobbulus is decent if u want world pvp, not sure if Grob has more alli or horde tho
---
Horde do get frustrated easily in fair 1v1s.
---
There are no portals to Theramore/Stonard in classic, only to the three main cities.

No it doesn’t
---
But it will explode when BWL comes out, so...
---
That's what AOE is for after spy
---
It doesnt matter. A 2 mechanic boss and 1 button classes are going to stay 2 mechanic bosses and 1 button classes with or without 300 spellpower.
---
Invis potions+sapper charges+enemy raid gathering for MC=FUN.
---
On my server it seems more like the Horde is at war with each other more than with the Alliance. They just sit back and kill us while we constantly bicker at each other.
---
Well they probably didnt finish is a nice thought
---
On any fight that you would actually benefit from 22mp5, there will be enough splash damage that your shield will get knocked off within a minute or less.
---
But yeah I guess epic items do make people go stoopid go crazy
---
It means a lot of alcohol consumption has been had since phase 2 release
---
It's completley factual. You want me to stream horde perspective going into BRM and dying 10 times? Because I can. Let me know.
---
You are making this out to be a lot of work. It isn't, except in the rare instance where you want to twink 49 and have zero level 60 friends to help.
---
I would twink every bracket in vanilla and each one is pretty easy to set up. First, chances are you are planning to do this with a few people anyway (guild mates, friends, whatever). So you all take turns helping each other get the gear. As soon as someone can enter the dungeon they need, all the 60s run the 40-49 character through the dungeon until they get the items. The 60s can just murder through and virtually no exp is gained (thanks to the 60s in the group). Then you all just rotate to the next person until you're all decked out, and then you level to 49.
---
Enchants and such are just farmed out with your main, obviously.
---
The total time required to set a group up like this is still going to be less than the time required for a group to hit 60 on new characters, get raid spots and then raid every single week until they have their items OR honor grind to fill in gaps. Even if you get super luck with the raid drops, you're still looking at it taking weeks (due to weekly lockout) to get your PvP gear. Most will wait even longer because the really good pieces are going to be a hot commodity in the raid.
---
I actually think that's hilarious.  Sometimes I will unequip an item that I already have before entering the dungeon that drops it so I can need it again.  \*shrug\*
---
Wouldnt this also fuck them on their new server for AQ 40? Most these situations are from high pop servers that are still going to open AQ faster than the servers available to be transfered to.
---
This. Last in WPL as a level 55 rolling solo I was continuously jumped  by a group of 4 level 60 alliance. They just rolled all around WPL eventually always making it back to me. I don’t understand what about this is fun. I like to pvp and love world pvp . I don’t necessarily bitch about being ganked but I don’t see how anyone finds it fun in a completely skilless Enviroment. 
---
I don’t even like large scale pvp where you’re just standing in one spot casting spells hitting someone and just hoping you don’t die while the server lags.
---
&gt; How can I convince my friend to abandon all of these great reasons to play a mage, and embrace the stupidity of the 3 paladin gang?
---
As soon as he will learn his first portal - you will understand why every party love mages)  
---
Also think about drop - three paladins will fight for all plate\two-hander drops in dungeons. With mage you will have only one other person to roll for this, so it's 50/50 chance, instead of 33%.
---
Wait.. You mean you're leveling mage since is more fun or cause it can get more gold and better at farm than hunter?
---
Both classes have a pretty effective "tank 5s and heal raids" build.
---
Get cat form before you bail on the druid.  It makes questing a lot more fun.
---
Congratulations, good job on rolling PvE 👍🏼
---
Until you get MC'd into the lava
---
It is harder for the horde to get from a queue guy to places like BRM, ungoro, dire maul.  Half of their wait time is traveling there so it will seriously mitigate their numbers.
---
I already have a I think it’s +9 Agi bow, should I just go to DMN then?
---
Run naked
---
so you have to be at the BG master in town to accept queue and enter the BG?  
---
i thought q will pop and it will teleport you automatically into the BG
---
I got destiny from my first pack of lashers
---
Dont forget the entitlement!
---
Yeah my thoughts too. I have a lvl 60 shammy so might even farm SFK myself and see how I get on. Thinking of getting a 2nd account for my twink so I can go get the stuff I need while my main clears the instances before I even log in just for the bosses 😂
---
Oh, probably -- I wanted to give a conservative estimate and some context.
---
There were large scale battles in CATA, so yeah, maybe not a declared “war”,  but more akin to the Vietnam war. In Classic the Horde and Alliance seem to be in a Cold War state.
---
Great info here - I guess I will put the +20 FR on my FR head slot item  and bring it with.  I think with 3 slots I could probably put on 60-65 FR out of the gear I've currently got.  I haven't raided in a long time and this will be my first raid with my guild - I don't want to have the appearance of a clueless, unprepared idiot.  I'll bring my FR pieces and don them for trash after Garr, and make sure to have some GFPP's and a few stacks of elixirs of the mongoose.
---
You just found a shit guild, nothing to do with DKP.
---
Look for a guild that's actively recruiting hunters. You're joining pretty late so you don't want to be the sixth hunter who only gets invited to raids every other week or something. 
---
We have 4 hunters and 1 raid team, we bring three a week and rotate the 4th out. That hunter still earns DKP for being available at the time of the raid each week, and can then go PUG it afterwards if they want. We also agreed between us to bid 1 on tier items and just roll them so we can save DKP for stuff like rings and Ony head. 
---
It can work tremendously well if you find a guild that really knows what they're doing. Unfortunately most of those guilds are already full.
---
My comment above is still true though. The fights are easier than retail LFR. That's not debatable.
---
Maybe he was the only person who could equip it, or all the others had it already? Or hell, maybe he just won the greed roll... I mean, who else could use it - Rogue and Warrior right?
---
Most people are too fucking lazy and greedy to handle the vanilla loot system, it's as simple as that. And the more I play the more I realize that Blizzard have done a social good in gradually eliminating its significance, even if it has made the game worse. 
---
I couldn't name a single item on my retail main, and it has been that way for years. I hate that. I love the feeling of getting a drop in vanilla. But is it really worth the trouble for those of us not in high-end guilds?
---
I do my homework and understand which drops I should reasonably expect to compete for. I am an officer in a loot council guild and I spend a lot of time outside the game researching items and scenarios and developing knowledge and logical justifications for decisions we make. All with the objective of removing drama. 
---
But as long as you have a plurality of greedy people who do minimal research, there is going to be some drama. It seems only the high end guilds are unanimous in their mentality regarding loot.
---
Not even close. I’m from that server EVERYTHING is camped by horde with 10-20.
---
You can’t take any of the boats. WpL and wolf camped, all the dungeon entrances camped.
---
Like no joke. You have die ten times to get into any dungeon.
---
3-4 biggest alliance guilds transferred off also.
---
&gt;who did the research and practiced the execution. 
---
Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt.
---
Only practice makes perfect.
---
ench shaman are the worst.
---
as ench, they'll roll on every melee gear... but since good shaman go resto/ele at lvl 60, they'll also roll on every healer gear... and why not caster gear, cause they are part-elem.
---
so they are eligible to need on every cloth-leather-mail piece and just about every weapon minus sword.
---
But they are also the prime candidate for weird meme spec... so if something weird like hand of edward the odd drop, they'll be ready to need it.
---
However, as a meme spec... nobody really expect them to do more than drop windfury and perhaps, if the condition are really dire, cure poisons/diseases... 
---
So you can need on nearly every drop, spend half the instance AFK auto-attacking and still be considered a A-tier shaman.
---
Yes, Warlock can do Maraudon and DM:E
---
What server?
---
sort by new never ceases to amaze me
---
This has been exactly it for me. I'm pretty burnt out on the game because getting into BRM as a 60 priest is a minimum of 6-7 corpse runs, and that's not even getting inside the instance. If blizzard doesn't fix the population issues and BGs aren't the savior we are hoping for I probably won't continue to play. I loved the PvP in P1 because it was actually balanced, I got ganked by larger groups of horde, I ganked with larger groups of alliance but on top of all of that I had a lot of fun 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc... skirmishes that either side had a hope of winning.
---
Blizzard should have implemented systems to prevent creation of new characters on horde/alliance side on the heavily imbalanced servers but we are beyond that point now and I believe they need to implement faction based login queues for the health of the game.
---
Sometimes I'll walk into a group of AOE the mage pulled and fear them everywhere lol. AOE mages can suck it. 
---
 If it's opposing faction I got that MC.
---
They're great for getting into camped instance portals
---
You also have z,x,c,v,f,g,r and t relatively close to your movement keys, I use them religiously
---
Well I was obviously talking about out of combat. In between trash pulls, I won't heal a Warlock that goes from 100% to 10% health just because he wants to life tap. That just slows the whole group down while I have to drink more. I'll give him what heals I can spare during combat.
---
As a horde I won’t reveal where I honor farm, (not that I’m any good or anything, only got about 14kish honor this week). But I usually do it with just myself or one other person. I get about 175-230 honor per solo kill or 90-120 in shared kills. it’s a little slimy killing someone, then twice more after they rez. But the alliance do the same thing with groups of 4-7. Im not sure what you expect would happen? If it’ll get better in 2 weeks time, I know myself the amount of world pvp I do will be limited to when I farm, since I’ll be in battlegrounds the remainder of the time
---
HoER would be preferable for PvP if you can get your hit high enough. However I still might use the LHH if I'm in a premade with healers. Really just depends what gear you have in your bags.
---
Its not "losing" or being "bad" to die and get griefed by a zerg. It is silly to be frustrated to the point of transfering when you rolled on a PvP server. Not a fan of people that make statements like yours, its pretty idiotic imo.

---
Impale Prot isn't worth it.
---
Yes I think they do
---
nah they had a full raid
---
Yeah, but they are still much easier. It took people 80 days to kill rag after domo in vanilla. Playing classic I am annoyed if I die on Rag with a pug and I never saw Rag submerge.
---
It goes to rogues and tanks then fury. I think there has not been a raid yet in classic where a strikers mark would be greeded. Nice of you to give the benefit of the doubt but it’s incredibly unlikely and it was probably just the result of an uninformed raidleader thinking hunters should have prio on ranged weapons.
---
This is how I get into BRM as alliance. It saved me a couple of the 10 corpse runs I need to get in.
---
*Chuckles*
---
"I'm in danger."
---
Yeah I got that impression. Just curious what the actually populations are.
---
I’m not quite sure if I understand the point of this post. So the person being ganked in WPVP doesn’t get anything but honor if he wins? Why would he not care about getting honor? I don’t want to copy and paste something that’s been said millions of times but if the person has zero interest in honor, ganking, or ranking up, he is definitely on the wrong server.
---
there is nothing impressive about any achievement in classic wow, hate to break it to you
---
Horde seem to be really focused on Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes, but most other zones are very alliance dominated. WPL/EPL are usually firmly under alliance control.
---
When I originally played the game in Vanilla, I came in with the hopes that "contested zones" could be captured, kind of like keeps in Dark Age of Camelot. 
---
Having more zones under your continuous control would offer benefits to that faction. Those benefits ranged from experience bonuses and stat increases to exclusive faction access to a special dungeon (in DAoC it was called "Darkness Falls").
---
I was a little upset that this kind of thing wasn't originally implemented, but obviously with there being PvE servers, it just couldn't work.
---
And i thought that was a intentional mistake to make fun of how little some people know about it but still judge it.
---
I'm at work right now so I can't but you could probably google and find a decent disc build. Yeah at around that +healing 10% healing doesnt scale as well as 10% mana. Also PI is nice to have.
---
You have to go to remote areas in EPL/Silithus/WS where you only occasionally see roving bands of rape gangs
---
Even though i am a PvP server player, simply because i want the freedom to fight in contested areas if i want to. Still, i always saw PvE realms as a different dimension where Horde and Alliance are more in harmony with each other and fight against common enemies instead of each other, apart from the "skirmishes" in BGs and other places where fighting the opposing faction is allowed.
---
Also the crossfaction NPC friends you meet on your journeys, like a Dwarf and an Orc being lifelong friends, or Jaina and Thrall. Some simply do not like senseless conflict.
---
Lore wise PvP realms are the low bottom, filled with individuals who wanna see the world burn.
---
No.
---
Most of the playerbase wanted flying mounts and they gave us that in TBC. They regret having to listen to whiners about ruining immersion and all that shit.
---
Think about it- if flying was so bad why the fuck would there be a freakout if they removed it? They saw an opportunity to wrap flying into a bad excuse for content so they have you grind reputations and time gate it.
---
Flying mounts aren't even bad. People just found an excuse to blame it for the problems it didn't even create.
---
The biggest myth ever about flying mounts is that they ruined world PvP. That was dead the momemt battlegrounds released. We will see the same cycle of world PvP slowly die out again. If this won't open people's eyes then nothing will.
---
Don't worry about fury/prot DW unless your damage dealers do like 900+ PS each.
---
What? This doesn’t make any sense
---
Not sure only thing ppl can use to get rough idea is ironforge.pro which uses warcraftlogs 
---
That was before all the guilds transfered it was 68/32
---
Ashbringer for sure! Just moved there, leaving behind my 50+ main from Stonespine. Ashbringer is pretty damn near 50/50. Having a blast here as Alliance!
---
I was in a group that saw that drop. The holy priest was clearly new to the game and goes "Is that good for priests?", while wearing all green gear with a few blues. Someone in the group says "Nope", and then the priest greeds, and a hunter wins it.
---
Private server populations are nothing compared to classic.
---
In what way, shape or form, did my post resemble to sum1 triggered?
---
As far as i read it, its a simple explanation to how dungeon id´s work.
---
the op however must rly have salt running in its veins, cuzz theres no exploits in solo tribute runs, nor is tos selling the loot from said run.
---
its rly like guilds selling leafs and eyes in mc...clear it, WTS, inv buyer, buyer goes get it.
---
He spawns destroyers behind you, so you can't cheese him from the mini-elementals.

Warden staff drops and everyone needs and a resto druid wins and offers me a "good deal" I said sell it bro.  I was bear tank and only just recently got unyielding maul a few days ago.  The warden staff dropped over a month ago and I'm still bitter.  We dont hesitate to let someone roll need on a blue if it's only worth 10g in ah and we all say grats but if it's an epic bis for me I have to pay you hundreds of gold wtf
---
&gt; I could also see loot drama around "I'm rolling need for transmog."
---
OK, this I can see as a definite problem. I remember my first encounter with the "transmog economy" when I got back into WoW in 2016. I was low level (&lt;20, I think), checking the AH for some gear and came across a belt upgrade for me. A teen-level belt was selling for hundreds of gold!
---
Yeah, I definitely don't want that kind of thing happening in Classic. As much as I like the transmog idea -- I don't like the haphazard and mix/match look that the game gives us as we level -- I can see the economy (and loot) problems that can come with transmog.
---
Yeah its just if you're min/maxing then 10% healing from Holy scales way better with worse gear and 10% mana scales better once you have more gear.
---
Looks like Grobbulus at 330a server, except the red would be alliance.
---
A hunter doesn’t need it, you can outrange the fireballs from the trash mob packs and even the baron debuff
---
Shield slam is your biggest threat ability BY FAR.
---
I sell many raw "worthless" fish on AH for much higher than vendor price. 20 raw mudsnappers have gone for as high at 14.99s and bristle whiskers as high as 79.99s per stack.
---
Wow, this is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.
---
I see your friend “Suction” still got their energy 😏
---
*Now we can play the game...*
---
It's good for helping low levels find the level 50+ ghosts in Duskwood
---
I took the first week of classic off of work, and no-lifed the second. Nearly all of it was cleave groups in dungeons.
---
I did MC as a 60 priest the 2nd reset.
---
My alt i've been leveling now is a warrior, and on track for the same time /played to 60, but, I've already been playing that guy for more than a month of actual time.
---
Just free action potions make a world of difference, and they're dirt cheap to make / buy.
---
Time to make a mage alt

Man, I loved and hated this movie because of this scene. He just leaves his family to die like that. How would you live with yourself after

T2.5 chest
---
Not everyone has the luxury of logging 3-6 hours a day. Kids. Job. Life. Etc..
---
When I was in college I could grind all day, but I have about 6 days played total since release on a 52 priest with no alts. Haven't really played since phase 2 since its impossible to level.
---
And you're right, I don't care as much as I did when I was 19, but it's still annoying because I'd probably be closing in on 60 about now if Blizzard had kept their word and released Phase 2 at the end of the year like they said. I'd at least be able to raid and have a fighting chance in WPVP.
---
Without a 60, the game is basically broken for those on a PVP server
---
4HM is a hard fight by Classic standards for sure, but the reason so many guilds were stuck was because it required 8 reasonably geared tanks, and nobody knew that until a couple days after the first guilds got to the boss and wiped enough to determine the mechanics (and therefore raid composition requirements)
---
Also, now with 550 healing you have no need for 10% healing which doesn't scale as well. 10% mana will be way better for QoL as well as PI will help get more damage onto the boss. Sometimes I straight up YOLO a dungeon boss and PI myself and do almost 300dps. Fun stuff.
---
Some *feel* dead compared to others. And is probably what it was during vanilla, I just don't remember as nearly all of my vanilla memories were in raiding guilds and not of leveling.
---
My main is on Skeram, I made an alt that I was going to play with RL friends on Arcanite Reaper and AR feels like a ghost town by comparison.

Had a ret pally as a guild leader and dungeon regular until just recently; I kept trying to explain to him that he should tank instead of me (an arms/prot hybrid), but he refuses to download a damage meter to see what I'm seeing:
---
When I tank and he does dps, I do crap damage, and he does about 10% more than me. 
---
When he tanks and I do dps, I do 3x my tanking damage...and he still does 10% more than me.
---
Mana may cause issues for raiding, but for dungeon content pallies really do some fun stuff.
---
I’m pretty sure I saw this stream. But I think you were a priest?
---
I went from Flamescarred shoulders directly to Nightslayer this week. Truestrike don't exist.
---
I had a simillar situation. I was Questing in the barrens as a lvl 15 warlock. Got a few greens that I couldn't equip. At crossroad a would go around trading people to try and sell them. Realised after a while instead of selling them for their AH prices I would instead make them pay for what they were willing to pay. Made my interactions way better and a few of them added me as friend afterward. After all, It's digital money with no real currency, no need to stress about it.
---
You guys should stack druids instead.
---
Don't listen to him... Impale prot is dead in classic
---
well i have been considering a transfer. you know of a good realm to go to with some balance or ally favored?
---
&gt; I got my truestrike on my rogue alts 3rd BRD, and both MH/OH within 8 runs. 
---
This story seems legit. &gt;_&gt;
---
I dont play a mana class and I have never really been exposes to the life tap drama, I just find it weird from both points of view.
---
The tank has to wait for the healers mana, defiantly slows the group down in some circumstances.
---
It's not terrible. I have xbow from ud strat as well. Strikers is better. And it was a pug, I don't give a shit.
---
I don't know what server you're on, but I sure know it isn't Fairbanks.
---
I cast this on priests and mages as they run past and hope they just blindly reciprocate.
---
Don't worry about FR Gear. It's much more efficient to buy Fire/G. Fire Resistance Potions to make up the difference. Save the Greaters for Domo/Rag/Ony
---
Pop one potion just before the fight and maybe a second if you get low during the fight.
---
I never want salv as a healer,  I always give myself wisdom.   That being said i wait on the initial heal til it's needed
---
Distracting people into the water at Booty Bay is oddly satisfying lol.
---
Was just piling things on, to be honest. Taking the Ony Trinket is just such a waste.

Carebear server Westfall has room for you.
---
I want to make a 29 Shaman Troll twink, stacking every source of IAS (helm, legs,gloves, 3% weapon, Flurry, Zerking) etc. and stacking as much attack power as possible with rockbiter.
---
My goal is 1700HP and 600AP (mostly unachievable) with rockbiter, stacking primary strength as the increased attack speed and zerking (43% apparently at 40% health or lower according to the "not a bug" thread) will bring corpsemaker down to 1.43 attack speed (for flurry initial 3 hits).
---
Rockbiter at level 29 grants 170 AP (85 strength) + 40AP (SoE R2) which gives me a third of what I'm aiming for.
---
The trick from there is just getting gears with the highest amount of raw AP/Strength on them to scale my base hits with the source of IAS I have.
---
I also plan to have plenty of sapper charges and goblin mortar x2 to syngergize with fire nova totem.
---
I never thought that selling crafted items on the AH is a good idea.
---
Most people will gradually gather the mats on their own, and then pay the crafting fee.
---
You might get royally fucked here and may not be able to sell it for the price you paid for mats, I dunno.
---
I remember getting to Outland thinking it'll be a blast because I could fly around. I'll just fly around jumping from quest to quest, knocking things out left and right, no sweat! 
---
Little did I know that managed to both introduce a faster way to get around and make it beyond boring and tedious at the very same time.
---
I think they announced flying mounts, then started play testing, realized it was a community-killing feature, and had to do them anyway. 
---
They spend a lot of time and effort making the different zones, and obviously very much want people to experience it all at a pace where the player comes across as much as possible. Hence the Pathfinder stuff. They can't get rid of flying mounts (can you imagine only having a ground mount in Outland or Northrend?) so they had to gatekeep them to make sure you walked through as much as possible.
---
So yeah, for those reasons I think they regret them.
---
What's weird is that a game like City of Heroes had an absolutely outstanding community even though you could fly (or jump, or run real fast, etc) at level 14 which wasn't a lot of time in terms of gameplay. But even though people were flying around, there was all kind of community.
---
Some of the transfers are faction locked.

Poor Gary
---
Sf swords is pretty viable once you have aq gear. It holds its own when you get past about 35% crit
---
*cough*
---
to get BG in sooner? arguably that worked? (even if it's not as soon as expected).
---
Also, while people expected PvP, they didn't necessary expect such lopsided server where litterally every lvl 48+ area would be crammed with horde squads... heck, i've seen horde camping the feralas boat.
---
I’m horde and I see lots of alliance fighting, there is a specific group that likes to hang at a share flight path. They then get mauled when azurgos spawns but that’s how that goes
---
It's really a burden to have to farm all the mats for it.
---
Can you tell me what his rotation is?  I'm also a ret pally and have only tanked twice but looking to improve.
---
I shit you not, I was in a joint MC with another guild, and the guild we were cooperating with tried to get us to give a quick strike ring to one of their players because it was his birthday, precious.

Ideally, you'd have an OT handle her in P1 while you stay below them in threat, then you drop your whole rage bar on her while she's running back for P2 transition.  You handle whelps and keep rage up then as she comes down from P2, you pop into berserk stance, pop recklessness, pop back into defensive nad drink a Mighty Rage potion and just shield slam/BT her in the face as much as you can.
---
All of your warrior dps should be doing the same thing. I'd rather have a fury warrior in a mix of plate and mail and leather tank her than a random squishy warlock.
---
In a perfect pull you don't lose anybody, but you should lose less because your crits with shield slam and such are like mini-taunts.
---
perfect 10/10
---
You want to pre-pot (Drink potions before the pull) so that the cooldown is off during the fight and you can drink another one.
---
For ragnaros specifically, I'll use a GFP as soon as I'm in position (crossed the lava paths etc) and then pop a second during the fight if it gets hairy
---
what is okay gear compared to the other fury warriors in your raid? are you optimally spec'd? optimally geared? using consumables? have an acceptable hit cap? keeping BS up, and spec'd into improved BS? 
---
lots of stuff can make you do more or less dps. need more info
---
Meant to say ubrs! But it is legit
---
Rag is a gear and coordination check. Is DPS optimized to do damage? Does tank have FR gear? Can raid bring Fire Pots? Can raid stand in correct spots?
---
If you can answer yes to all of those, then you'll beat Rag. But just because some guilds can say yes to all of that, doesn't mean everyone can. So that's where the challenge lies.
---
Mortal Strike debuff is high priority, meaning it won't get knocked off on boss fights. Thus in raids you can't use Arms' best ability against bosses.
---
Yeah and im 300 tailoring/enchanter

Being inconvenienced versus the game being unplayable are two different things. Why the hell would we pick a PVP server to have the full game taken away from us by the opposing faction? I disagree, there's world pvp and then there's full on greifing. Level 50-59 players are unable to do quests that add immersion into their gaming experience, and instead completely have to alter how they play due to the population and imbalance. When people use your rhetoric it simply means more and more Alliance will shift to a PVE server or quit entirely, adding more imbalance. BG's may help, but Blizzard should have addressed this in some way, and there have been many suggestions.
---
Hell I am 60, and I can't even pick a spot to farm shards on my Warlock without being spam killed for hours.
---
Arms is never good. 2h Fury is competitive on horde.
---
This is the mindset people need to have on a pvp server. If people enjoyed their time leveling and turned smaller ganks into a skirmish, they could enjoy the pvp. Unfortunately, everyone waits until 60 to join the fight and is miserable along the way.
---
I went to a big war in hillsbrad and there were people in the raids as low as 36. They were charging in and getting slaughtered, but they stayed for a while and looked like they were having fun. I’m sure they went on to level after that and needed to stay in groups for fear that they might get killed. That’s the feelings pvp worlds should have.
---
One of my first runs in UBRS was with a better geared pally as MT and myself as OT. I kept having to taunt mobs just to get hit so I could get some rage to be useful.
---
Lol says strikers better for pvp and already has rhok what a scumbag.
---
I had the Axe you get from the quest chain in SM (can't remember the name) and was like in the 50's, tried to get the mace or axe from Maura as it was a noticeable upgrade for me. Lost the axe to a ret pally, "hey, it was a really big upgrade for me :)" this was after like my 8th princess run?
---
Like yeah man, good on you but honestly fuck that, I was pretty mad.
---
&gt; it is definitely more profitable with less stress compared to farming
---
I suppose it'd have to be or those mages would be out farming...
---
From what I've read, yes, it is reportable if you're on the same faction. All is fair with the opposing faction, but doing it to your own is griefing.
---
I've read this many times and by Blizzard employees on their forums.
---
I think my main question is what is the best talent tree/abilities to spam in PVE. Mostly greens/blues with the ony axe.
---
Lol, exactly. This dudes day was probably ruined because i have strikers. He won't be able to sleep tonight. "We cannot allow hunters to have a bow!!".
---
Joined a DM west group as the tank. Clearing no problem, then after we kill demon dog they say its a warlock mount quest run. Hooked into a 15 min long encounter because I still needed last boss. 
---
No loot loss or toxicity, just tiresome waste of my time. People need to be upfront about that kinda stuff, like out of the way quests or bosses. Would probably still tank it, just dont spring it up on me that this 45 min run is gonna take an extra 20 mins.
---
Whenever i craft something i look up the mat costs and add about 10-30% depending on rarity of the item and rarity of the recipe. It normally sells the first time i put in on the AH
---
sometimes when i move every 5-10 minutes it disconnects me anyway because of lack of activity
---
i think it detects if you're actually doing something
---
some of my guildies have suggested logging in and out of bank alt every 15-20 min
---
Depends on what you mean by "works well". If you are mainly a PVP player then sub is excellent, and mediocre for PVE. If you're looking to top the charts when raiding then Sub will not be viable.
---
How much do Ony's melee attacks hurt with recklessness popped? Do you pop shield wall alongside it? I'm fairly geared in deep prot and there are times when ony deals a crap ton of damage to me with her attacks
---
I’d say arms is generally preferred for PVP. It’s relatively gear dependent though. 
---
Arms is like being a big, bursty wrecking ball.
---
That would get in the way of him being able to tell me to "go play retail"
---
Did you here about Crypto Kitties two years ago?
---
How do you solo reset an instance without having to run out?
---
Same general playstyle as 0/24/27 just trades blastwave for ice barrier which a lot of people think is better right now.
---
fwiw the guy who said every mage going for r14 is ignite/barrier is kind of full of shit, imp cs is still fine.
---
your logic wont fly very well around here... heh
---
A real time traveller right there
---
A raid can fit up to 8 parties (groups) in it
---
I don't think you understand how abnormally bad this is. People who roll on a PVP server expect it and welcome it. What is happening now is NOT like vanilla and is NOT what is to be expected of wPVP.
---
It took me 45 minutes and 15 deaths to get from the entrance of DM to DMN.  That is not normal, that is not to be expected, that is not what PVP traditionally was on Vanilla or private servers.  This is a phenomenon  specific to Classic and it is understandable that people don't like it or find it fun.
---
Ran into some 48s and 47s questing in ferelas. The 48s were instantly murdered. The 47s left alive to tell the tale.
---
The joke has been around way longer than that
---
&gt; Mythic raiding on retail has consistently been the best gaming experience for any game. 
---
Did you mean the best gaming experience for any PvE MMO?
---
Imagine not being able to read. I don't have rhok yet. I've been using strikers for 2 months now. But im gonna DE it when I get rhok and post it on here to piss off you entitled loot whore cunts.
---

Thanks for ted talking.

the worst is when you have a loot council / officers who don't have the balls to make smart decisions.
---
AKA: choker of the firelord drop... massive upgrade for all the caster DPS, a largely irrelevant side-grade for healers ( compared to the living chain necklace from stratholme).
---
BUT, wowhead list the choker of the firelord as BIS for healers cause it has +1 healing power... therefor all the healers should have an equal shot at it.
---
also see: priest rolling on staff of dominance, hunters on brutality blade, healers on sapphiron drape...
---
Lol gamon is such a loser, i always beat him up and stole his lunch money. I absolutely loathe seeing him do well down at AQ. Because ill have to face what i am and what i did everytime i see him and it can come back and haunt me if he keeps showing up in these high end environments. So can we please not prop him up like this and keep him down?
---
R/SuspiciouslyDetailed
---
We wiped this week and decided that this weekend if you do not have 2 Greater Fire Pots then you cant come for the kill. Really looking forward to the results... it takes away like 5000 damage per player, so you're literally removing 200,000 points of damage from the fight.
---
It's absolutely bonkers.
---
I'm too invested to leave at this point.
---
Are you horde telling alliance to leave your pvp server? How fucking dumb are you.
---
Grow a pair and roll Alliance, coward.
---
I lost that ring to a warlock about a week ago. He can't even life tap while the effect is on?! And I'm a holy priest.. some people are just purple blinded. If you see this Voo*** on Stonespine EU: I hope you step on a Lego
---
True classic experience where 10 days of played in you realize you lost the game during character creation.
---
They really should have been a separate faction.
---
Everyone's experience is different, so I've no intention of chewing you out about it. I just found it funny that some of the prevailing advice is "Play less" in some form or another. 
---
If anything, I wish the servers had been smaller, so this kind of PvP farming wasn't... *everywhere*.
---
Makes sense. Something like a saucission vaudoise :-)
---
Just noticed that's hilarious . How does one play when they have to click everything
---
:thonking:
---
So, you're asking for participation handouts?
---
If you're not trying to climb it, why do you eve care?
---
You don't want to initiate and put in the long term effort, and just want to get bonuses for "being there".
---
This is not the norm. Just saying.
---
You're an asshole from the eyes of the opposite faction, regardless if you kill them or not.
---
We tried MC with 19 peeps, 2 tanks (+2 fury for OT on some fights) and 4 heals, and we struggled. We could do all fights except last 3 just due to the number of adds during the boss fights, and all of us are fairly well geared being 50% BiS and 50% pre-raid BiS.  But when we went to 24 peeps with 3 tanks(+2 fury for OT on some fights) and 6 heals, it was really easy.   
---
Splitting an MC group right down the center would be tough, regardless of gear because the number of tanks and heals. Im not sure of your 40 man composition, but I would be surprised if your 40 man had 10-12 heals and 6 tanks. 
---
If your splitting your MC runs forever, I would just take whatever you have, and recruit up to 5-6 heals, and 3 tanks, have your warriors or ret pally bring tank sets for those few fights. Turn your group into a 25 man group instead.
---
In reality though gear isnt much of an issue for MC, and where gear is rearing its ugly head, you shouldnt struggle for long considering people should be crafting and dungeoning inbetween raid nights. Gear issues will go away after 2 weeks, maybe 3 if peeps are uber casual.
---
Got it my third BRD run - had to out-roll 3 other people too. I've had it for over two months now, so I've definitely put it to good use. Honestly thought it was a common drop.
---
Or it starts from your first respec. Dunno
---
The sheer degree of butthurt on this sub is making me want to quit the sub, not the game.
---
Here it is lads the return of the huntard.
---
Question: the stable in menethil sells hotses and says that any race can buy them. Can dwarves, NEs, and gnomes buy a horse as their mount here?
---
The talking option was added a little later. Due to the window bugging out and not porting people some of the time.
---
And both are camped by us
---
saving this for later!
---
What a punk bitch lol.
---
&gt;Or you could just go play retail
---
What a childish and dismissive answer. OP isn't begging to change the game or be catered to. If you read their comments it sounds like they've gone the extra mile too. 
---
Are you always such a condescending asshole?
---
Savage Chain dropped on my very first BRD run yesterday...
---
The warrior who lost the roll was piiiiiissed.
---
Lion heart is being sold for about 1500-1800g on my realm..
---
Lmao what's up your ass? Why are you so angry I got strikers in a mc pug?  
---
Lots of angry little cunts in here.
---
Reck makes you take 20% more damage. So if you have 5k buffed HP its like tanking with 4k HP. Also, you cannot pop reck and shieldwall. Reck/shieldwall/retaliation are all on a shared 30 min cooldown.
---
LOL Even if Asmogold wasn't given loot, do you think he would waste his time raiding Molten Bore every week?    Classic is a half finished game.
---
Her melee really isn't an issue. Even with recklessness up it is negligible compared to her breath. (which healers should be ready for anyways with big heals/shield.
---
Also all the 30 minute warrior cooldowns share a timer. So popping Recklessness in zerker stance puts Shield Wall for defensive, and Retaliation for Arms, on cooldown too. If I get in trouble for the transition with an unlucky combo of breath + melee + fear and know my healers just all got feared.... I will usually pop last stand an a healthstone to compensate.
---
ASCII codes, not literal letters lol. Not sure if that’s how it’s actually done, just saying that’s a much more likely way to code it if so. I hope it’s not done that way though. A hidden reroll would be way more fair.
---
I might do things differently though. Like when I get a group I write a nice write up and copy paste it to everyone on the who list. I get a ton of responses. All about how to approach people
---
I haven’t done Remote Desktop since the first few weeks of launch but I would only need to cast a spell or move a bit for it not to boot me. The longest I did this for was an hour.
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
---
Not like having gear helps with 30 people attacking anyways.
---
Its probably sarcasm
---
Grats!!
---
He is 1/6, it's a fallacy that its lower.
---
It feels lower because its a fresh dice roll every time you zone in. There are 5 chances for you not to get him, and only 1 for you to get him.
---
It would take you about 100,000 runs to perform actual statistical analysis on it. Within that time frame, you would probably see him 30 times out of 80 at some point.
---
yes... that is the point.
---
I'm sort of surprised your guildie is crafting you LHH for you to re-sell. I would have assumed you'd want to keep the hats in-guild or charge larger fees to craft so the guild could benefit as a whole. You may also want to see if the hat can be crafted on opposite site and sell it on the neutral house for potentially more.
---
 I can't imagine what theur life is like when they get so upset over a fucking video game lol.
---
Definitely gonna post of vid of me DE strikers.
---
Close. PVE is fight if you BOTH want to. The "If I want to" options to not fight are run away, don't engage first, or avoid the area.
---
Wow what an absolutely Galaxy brain train of thought.
---
This screenshot proves it’s not alphabetical I think...I sang the alphabet song twice in my head to double check lol
---
I had this exact thing drop last night. Myself (56 warlock alt) , the healer and the tank all rolled for it. 
---
I won it but the healer was pissed I guess. Said it was BiS for him. This doesn’t really have much else in common with your post but the ring isn’t amazing. It’s basically a mana battery that is used for 500 damage and when you’ve been hit for that, the battery stops for 30 min cd. As a lock, I love it while leveling because of my pet so I can take advantage of it. I had another healer friend who said it was an alt type item in that it has a very specific use but otherwise won’t be worn much over a better mp5 + healing ring.
---
Did you reply to a different comment? The comment you replied to said that you zone back in to the battlemaster that queued you, so its actually easy to requeue.  Heading out after again to go WPvP would be the thing that's a pain.
---
Ez on whitemane mane
---
During peak hours
---
I was that very warlock, 15 years ago. And the mage just wouldn't have it that I was drinking along with everyone else.
---
It was so stuck, and so ingrained in his head that warlocks are to lifetap + bandage and that's it. **There should be no other way** for them to regen health, outside of a healer in combat.
---
As a follow healer though, I've long resigned to the fact that warlocks are simply going to simply stand there and wait for everyone else to mana up, get heals and then promptly tap himself down to 5% health and 'ready' for the next pull.
---
Yeah I went from thinking I won't hit 60 untill Christmas to believing it'll take 2-3 months before I even get my first piece of raid hear since I do ony once a week and MC twice a month. That's if I'm lucky as I'm a healer as well. Could be a year before a get my staff lol. 
---
 It's fun while I'm here though.
---
I use the invisibility trinket and it works, if you're able to activate at the top of the ladder then it will be enough to jump to the lava. Be careful about taking damage, it breaks the effect.
---
After doing some googling, you mean two raid groups (1 ally 1 horde) trading kills at a graveyard? There's already two mechanics in game to drastically reduce honor gained from doing this. I don't expect anything to be done about it personally.
---
Yeah man I don't even know how this turned into a discussion
---
From one tank to another, you really need to stand up for yourself. If you're level 51 and they're asking you to tank LBRS or something dumb like that, you need to tell them no. You're going to waste 1-3 hours wiping on trash pulls and body pulling skippable mobs because the others are too desperate.
---
We had mark of the dragonlord drop.  Our priest healer was super, super excited.  we were all stating grats! etc.  The mage won it stating it's for pvp.  I felt like a hunter getting strikers mark.
---
By using the extra rage you can hit ony enough during phase 2, before she lands, to pull aggro back btt she lands. melee can hit her when she sin the air if they stand under her when its safe and use abilities. auto attacks wont work. but things like sunder armor or heroic strike hit her.
---
Servers are already larger now than vanilla ever was. Fear mongering over dead servers is absolutely hilarious. You consigned yourself to a miserable experience now and into the foreseeable future to avoid a scenario I doubt happens at all.
---
Carry a stam set for death runs, switch to dungeon set later
---
I try to limit self gankings to 5 times a day.  The chafing gets a little uncomfortable if I do more.
---
That must hurt, we use loot council for the most part except when it's for a pvp item we just roll. As long as high tier loot doesn't go to raid loggers I'm fine with it.
---
Yea I've never seen this movie but I hope he fucking dies.
---
Maybe its lack of weed that makes people stupid?
---
Got a deed to thandol span this morning in my coffer run.
---
Big dick indeed
---
So it's basically jump down and Nova the little guys? Think I have just under 4k Mana so I should be good.
---
There is also the Gnomish cloaking device which gets used in world pvp often by mages in big fights, so they can get close to big groups without getting noticed.
---
Come to heartseeker brave boy. The alliance rules the mountain. Muhahaha
---
You bro I'm so stupid for rolling on an upgrade bow in a pug.  Oh the horror.
---
Its just much more rare than rhok and not good for you. Its just inconsiderate and ignorant to roll on a non upgrade you replace w a 50% drop. One day it will happen to you and youll see what a prick you are.
---
Silithus kiting method was pretty easy imo.
---
Mage alt incoming, tired of farming
---
No it doesn’t xD I was just messing around with the oddity that he got the briarwood reed in the first place.
---
Triple auras and all blessings, sign me up! Can a mage bubble hearth??
---
I can just feel the hate seeping out of every pore of reddit at the Alex Jones audio.  XD
---
Great choice.
---
Uhhh PVE servers will definitely BG a ton because there’s less interest in PvP so only the hardcore people will get ranked, and BGS are their only viable PvP option... everyone is going to BG constantly lol
---
Stamina, Crit%, Attack Power/Strength, and a slow 2h weapon.
---
Man one of you quote isn't even from me. Get it straight next time.
---
&gt;offload a lot of the calculations to clients
---
Is not from me, lol. It seems an obnoxious way to dismiss an argument. 
---
&gt;Doesn't matter for actual gameplay calculations. There are no legal and security factors in calculating the result of a spell hit. 
---
Yes it matter and it's actually linked to the first quote you took from me. Since the implementation aren't the same you cannot know how much they where close on the anti exploit verification from blizzard. So those check aren't the same and you cannot know for sure the impact on performance. 
---
&gt;Doesn't matter for actual gameplay calculations. There are no legal and security factors in calculating the result of a spell hit
---
No but in the large scheme this means that their client  is way more secure than what offered pservers. They are very knowed forum which still has a vanilla wow section which you can lookup. All of those exploit have been fixed by blizzard since on the retail client. 
---
&gt;It should be easy. It all comes down to how competent the decision makers are, and to whether they want to invest any money. 
---
I agree about decision making but performance issue aren't something you fix easily, it's not just about throwing more hardware at it.
---
I agree that money is what led us to this mess, blizzard are greedy bastard.
---
The only thing that bother me is that both challenge are vastly different and seing those made up argument is tiring.
---
I’d like to dick around with it. Thanks.
---
Then you aren't interested in pvp at this phase at least.
---
Ahh that makes sense. Wow. Why does that make me feel even older now?
---
Warning: Long ass post ahead.
---
Arms/prot is better when you first hit 60, but ideally your leveling spec was something along the lines of 31/5/15, so it won't require a respec. Once you get a few pre-bis items, (Blackstone Ring, HOJ, a decent 1H/Shield, etc) you can swap to either 11/5/35 (Deep prot), or 0/31/20 (Fury Prot). There are also variations that allow you to get Tac Mastery as Fury Prot, by giving up a few points in Prot or Fury. Typically you can play without Tac Mastery in dungeons just fine, and for raids it can be a waste of 10 points better spent in other areas, so I dislike the spec, but it is there if you want it.
---
As for DW tanking, and rocking all leather DPS gear, no. That is such a distant goal from when you first hit 60, that you should ignore the topic completely. Not only do YOU need to be geared out of your mind, but your healers need to be able to keep you alive, which means they need to be geared too. And neither of those issues matter if your DPS doesn't do enough damage that you need to DW tank to hold threat anyway, so it's a bit of a moot point when you first hit 60. I see this come up a lot, and I feel like I always need to reiterate my point here because of the misunderstanding. Fury tanking and DW tanking are entirely different things. There is a larger gap between DW and Fury tanking, than there is between Fury and Deep Prot. Fury tanking merely takes advantage of the significant bonuses Fury spec gives you to rage generation, as well as threat generation (by proxy). You still tank with a 1H and a shield, as deep prot would, your 1H just does more damage, and you use Bloodthirst instead of Shield Slam. 
---
It does also give you the option of DW tanking very specific fights as well. Golemlord in BRD is a good example where DPS matters much more than having your shield on. If you DW, you burn the golems much much faster, and that means it's easier for you to take control of the boss when he gets back. His primary damage comes from chain lightning, so having your shield on doesn't actually mitigate much damage, so it's typically easier to just smack him down with your DW setup. Strat UD, almost as an entirety, is also sometimes easier to DW tank. The pull are almost all single/doubles, and easily CC'd so your damage taken is minimal. DWing here would allow your DPS members to just go ham on every pull with little concern for pulling threat. Obviously, this all changes on a dungeon by dungeon basis, a pull by pull basis, and a party by party basis. Part of being a good tank is finding out what your group can handle. I've had groups where I ran all of BRD, 90% of UBRS, and DM:N, while DW tanking. I've also had healers who could barely keep me alive during Arena/Anger runs while I was in full BiS mitigation gear. 
---
Deep prot requires much less consideration, as you have fewer options. You can sword and board. That's really what you do best, and anything other than that means you are losing out on part of your spec. This means it is immensely easier for new 60s, and people who are new to tanking. You don't need to know your limits, or what your group can handle, as it will never change the way you are playing your character. You are pigeonholed into a very specific playstyle, and that has its benefits. You generate rage slower, but shield slam does an insane amount of threat, so it balances out in 5-mans. In raids, Fury/Prot will win the threat gen battle every day. 
---
TL;DR - Fury/Prot is better, but takes a deeper knowledge of the class, and the ability/willingness to adapt to each fight/party. It provides the exact same mitigation as Deep Prot provides, with the only downside being no shield slam, and no stun. Deep Prot is worse threat generation, but requires much less consideration for what content you are tanking, as it has less flexibility.
---
Blizzard's stance has always been "if there is a gameplay solution we don't get involved." Seems to me the gameplay solution here is to not be a lvl 1 in a lvl 60 zone.
---
There once was a lady from Stonebury Hollow!! She didn't talk much but boy could she sw-swa-swallow!
---
7 weeks of leaves, then an eye... then a leaf.
---
On my server bronze tends to sell for more than copper and tin, so i tended to smelt them into bronze and then sell the bars.  
---
On mine anyway, tin ore sells for more than tin bars, copper bars sell for more than copper ore. Iron ore sells for more than bars.
---
It can vary a lot though, even on the same server.
---
It's a little hit or miss honestly, dunno if it's server ticks/batching or detection being a roll, but rogues can sometimes just walk right up in your face and get an opener before you can unstealth them. 
---
However it does work quite a lot of the time and I fucking love it.
---
I actually messaged them about it. I was told they looking into revamping it. That was a month ago.  ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯
---
Nobody complains about warlocks lifetapping, they complain about them tapping at inconvenient times as a healer. A healers job isn’t to give you mana, it’s to keep the group up. Be considerate and have situational awareness, and there are no issues. 
---
I love having warlocks in the group, and have no problem with them life tapping. But if they put me in a position where I have to choose between going out of mana during a fight or letting them die because of lifetap, then they are the moron, not the healer.
---
Lmao
---
One of my guildies got bow last week on Kromkrush as alliance. You will have it 100x easier as horde.
---
Alliance don’t do it at all because they don’t have the numbers. It’s always horde so people can stop the bOTh SiDeS dO ThIs bullshit
---
Runs directly at a group of enemies. Dies. Pikachu face.
---
I've been commenting on this since it came out. Lol whoever put in the time did it all for nothing lol for something so simple missed. 
---
Big rip.
---
Lol. What will happen to me? This happens all the time with dps warriors who roll on everything. 
---
I'm such a bad person for rolling on the bow in a pug. How inconsiderate of me to complete strangers who I will never meet. May I get hit by a bus for my transgressions.
---
I don’t know really I would never have left my wife but the kid they let in screwed them all over so 😱 like yeah I get it the kids going to probably become a zombie but letting him in just increases the chances we ALL die selfish KIDS
---
In Vanilla, it wasn't unusual to raid for two weeks as a potential recruit. During that time, you'd get no loot unless nobody wanted an item. These days anybody with a pulse gets a ginvite, and then they get upset if they aren't showered in epics every raid.
---
My main also has mining engi. So my alt rogue is rocking herbalism + engineering. Now i can get all the consumes i want for both my chars while rocking the pvp on my rogue.
---
Lmao maybe read the post next time
---
&gt;Because they could not exist without humans. They can't breed normally, so only way to get new members is to kill humans with their plague.
---
Kind of like how gay people rely on straight people to make more gay people? =p
---
I agree, even with (relatively) good intentions a loot council can be a bad idea. In my guild, we have 10 mages and 4 warlocks. The council insists on distributing loot among _classes_ equally so all the warlocks are twice+ as geared as the mages. In 47 boss kills with the guild (4x10/10MC + an extra domo+rag, and 5 Ony) I've gotten one single boss drop, while all the locks got several and for some crazy reason a healing priest got the one mana igniting cord that dropped (BiS for all caster DPS and he's since replaced it with a blue from DM). Another 10/10, 8/10, and 1/1 in pugs with nothing just because only two or three things dropped that I needed and I lost the rolls.
---
Your perception of reality is interesting.
---
It wont be as  bad as it was in vanilla, with private servers they pretty much perfected what needs to be done.
---
Haha funny that you bring up those two items in particular. We were joint raiding with a guild we were hoping to merge with, so we were basically just rolling on loot but with the caveat that we would put some common sense restrictions on stuff so it broadly goes to the right classes with the view to improving us collectively. 
---
Staff of dominance drops, a lone disc priest in the other guild joins the mages and locks in rolling and wins it, we tell him nah sorry and give to next highest person (mage in his guild, not even one of our people). Dude has an ugly meltdown, claims it's best in slot, gquits the other guild when their GM sides with us, and links us an icy veins article as evidence. 
---
Next raid rag drops choker and it's basically a fucking mutiny from their healers as soon as I open my mouth to explain it'll be restricted to dps. I say whatever fuck it everyone roll, one of our healers wins it and he trades it to the highest rolling DPS, who was in their guild. 
---
Next day we started recruiting lol
---
With mental agility, max rank holy nova costs 675 mana, so you need around 6k mana to nova 9 times in a row. I have various int-based pieces to farm with to compensate for the lack of int on raid gear.
---
Hint. You'll have even more aggro if you do the pulling
---
I’m alliance on whitemane, would logon at 4 ST and pray Taiwan didn’t notice me. I got all but burning steppes done fairly pain free. Burning steppes took me 5 days with horde gang squads. Had a 10 man raid guard me at one point and rogues were ambushing the demon every time..
---
You usually get a ton of elemental fire from clearing MC.  Usually enough to make at least one fire pot for everyone on rag.  My last rag kill as a rogue I only used one pot and it didnt get used up until the very end.
---
Just have everyone pitch in and buy the recipe for someone in the guild to be able to make them.
---
There is a lot of unwarranted toxicity and elitism in this game. If you don't think so, you're probably one of the elitists or toxic people. 
---
Example: tank in raid last night kept calling everyone idiots and dumbasses just because we weren't cleaning mc fast enough. Mad because his guild does it faster. His guild is Reign on Skeram, one of the fastest mc clears on wow. Obviously he's not on the raid team or he wouldn't be pugging on a Sunday. We cleared in 2 hours, not bad at all. He was being toxic and an elitist just because he belongs to the same group that some of the best people belong to.
---
It's rampant on this game. But again, there are a ton of cool people as well.
---
Okay this is what I would do if I were you as I was in the same situation. Put the helm on AH, the buyout imp should be a number youre happy with, for this item I would go as high as 1300-1500 just due to demand. I would also start the bidding at 1000-1100g cause this is how much they'd be paying on their own for it. Once u put it on AH make an announcement on trade chat and world chat and let them know. Put it up for 24hrs and just be patient.
---
Nothing really looks good on orc males.
---
I mean you joke, but a paladin 5-man synergizes really well.
---
That's why I'm here. I'd love to be helpful to a guild that ACTUALLY appreciates it.
---
Ahh I didn’t realize about cooldowns. I’m an OT and I feel like in phase 3 even if I don’t hit her much at all in P1/2 she still targets me nearly every time when she lands. I’d rather start fighting her immediately when she lands as if I’m her target so I can avoid putting our casters in danger next time.
---
AoE stuff doesnt build "extra" threat, but just think what youre doing when you whirlwind. When you cast cleave or whirlwind, you are doing the same hit on the main target and 1-4 other mobs. Tanks have aggro specific tools, but when you pull a pack of multi enemies, essentially aggro gets spread out among them, with maybe one getting a bit more because the tank knows the group will be focusing that one. But, if you are dishing out basically the same threat to all mobs as you are to the main mob, there is just no way to generate that much AoE threat. 
---
Also, if you manage to pull aggro on the main target, but are spinning and slicing up the entire group, do you think those other mobs have more threat applied to them or less than the main target?
---
Thanks a lot. Yeah I am currently 11/5/31 and hit 60 a week ago. But I may visit the fury/prot spec once with shield and axe (orc). 
---
Just wondering do you do keep going for bis tank gear and not the crit leather stuff?
---
As a mage, I love Pally tanks. Able to drop a full duration Flame Strike+Blizz with the mobs not even bothering to look in my direction? Not needing to worry about kiting or taxing the healer? 30% aggro overhead? Sign me tf up.
---
blizzard if you may have noticed, has a very good record of making not very good choices, and getting by with good cinemas and their nametag.
---
Diablo 3 as a whole, WoW TBC beyond overall design choices removing the idea of a MMO, starcraft 2 balance over time. The dev's design philosophy when talking about D4
---
Maybe the only thing they have that actually is potentially not terrible is the reforge of WC3, all other games they have, they do some random potshot, and then the game no longer resembles what it originally was years after if they keep tinkering it because they are money hungry and tend to fire the guys who are actually good while apparently smelling their own farts and using cute phrases to explain a game development reasoning like "unfun mechanics" or "Dark"
---
Why prioritize capitalizations after numbers though?  Seems a bit more than alphabetized...
---
That's sort of the entire point. 
---
He feels so much guilt for it, but ultimately, it's survival of the fittest.
---
See it's the opposite for alot of people. The pve is a necessity to get gear and lvl so you can compete in pvp, since pvp is when you face unpredictable and intelligent opponents instead of pve where you face predictable boring encounters that take next to no skill to beat.
---
If you aren't hit-capped, the 1% hit bow will be an upgrade.

\*Jim Halpert peering through the blinds meme\*
---
How is it any better for a healer than a caster? It has no healing stats.
---
Casting Rebirth + shifting back into cat form afterwards = ~1700 mana.
---
3.5 powershifts = ~1700 mana
---
How much DPS does your raid gain from casting Rebirth on a dead player? Write that down and remember it. Now tell me how much DPS your raid gains from 3.5 powershifts.
---
Utility spells are a better use of a Druid's mana.
---
Nah it only works in darkshore unfortunately.
---
Bruh your wasting ALOT of potential if your gaming that much. Please consider other hobbies.
---
Good luck! 
---
The Recklessness + Mighty Rage pot + Shield Slam/HS/Revenge spam works really well as long as you didn't just eat a fireball right before she lands. The sucky part about this is if you happen to wipe on her you will not be able to use Recklessness for the next attempt. So make it count!
---
&gt;For every horde dominated PvP server there’s an alliance dominated pve server. 
---
Bro what the fuck are you talking about there is like 1/4th the number of PVE servers than PVP servers.
---
Legit?  I thought druid weapons damage/speed had no effect on a feral attack, they were purely stat sticks.
---
I dont have gathering professions so I've been farming essence of air in Silithus. Works out to 40g+ an hour unless you're getting camped or really unlucky.

Hey, I made this post while corpse running on Bigglesworth!

Options:
---
* Be Soul Link. They can still 100-0 you but they have to blow everything and play it completely perfectly.
---
* Hope they screw up and give you a window between CCs. 
---
* Be and orc and hope to get lucky
---
* Run around with a voidwalker all the time and lose other matchups, hope sap breaks early if they sap you and kill the VW.
---
* Felhunter + Catseye goggle or elixir, be extremely fucking paranoid and unstealth those fuckers before they can open. 
---
Basically there is no 100% reliable way.
---
If horde bg queues are very high (yes, even with x-realm bgs), many will want to faction change for sure. It doesn't matter if you have a premade with all gladiator titles and BIS raid gear if your queues are 40 mins long, it's very painful.
---
There is no need to go holy for current content. PvE content is cleared super fast and the PI speeds things up even more.
---
PI spec doesnt gimp you as much in PvP and solo as holy, so Id say stick with PI spec until BWL.
---
Iv been trying to decide if I want to roll a human or dwarf pally. In order to help me decide, I went around IF looking at geared humans or dwarfs to decide what I liked the look of more. This involved me running around in first person view following a dwarf for at least 5 full minutes so I could see and evaluate his looks from all angles. 
---
I'm confident he thought I was insane, although not a word was exchanged.
---
Are you shadow?
---
I got the +20 fishing pole from my first trap (1% chance) and the only time I ran arena in BRD the boss that drops savage gladiator chest showed up and it dropped the chest. Shit happens.
---
if you're pulling threat at 600 dps it's definitely your tanks fault
---
Is this hard to imagine for you?
---
Great, that's my server as well. It was ok at about 11pm last night, just as I was logging off........
---
Your best ability takes up a debuff slot in raids.
---
This is true for fighting non-twinks.  You won’t be one-shotting twink casters.  The amount of geared twinks in the 19s bracket is gonna surprise some folks that made twinks thinking they would feast on the weak.
---
I play on Heartseeker alliance, probably 75-80% alliance and I would change (along with my guild) to Horde in a heartbeat. The imbalance doesn't help either side and WPvP as the dominating faction is boring because it ends up with 20 random ally running around killing the same 4 people.
---
I lost both dal rends in UBRS to a hunter yesterday. Was salty for a minute but got over it.
---
I am still baffled though.
---
Basically making sure you are always casting them when they come off cooldown. This means saving rage at the right time, casting shield block at the right times to get a revenge proc if you are unlucky. All this while dumping excess rage into Sunder and Heroic Strikes. Learning to manage your rage and cooldowns will lead to better threat generation.
---
One dev said it was a ssitake, and considering it takes a long time to earn it now on retail yes.
---
DM E jump runs or Maraudon
---
On top of what everyone else said, if you're leveling 2H use whatever has the best damage range. Often times this is a staff. Hell, slavedriver's cane is pretty good even at 60. Don't listen to people who say "use the slowest weapon possible", it's crap advice for leveling and your crit is so low that you will almost never take advantage of Flurry while you're soloing.
---
I don't play a druid but google search links to basic macros on [this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/totally-pawesome-druid-macros-tested-in-beta-and-ready-for-classic/255251) page and [this](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/vanilla-wow-druid-macros/) page.

\#showtooltip Innervate 
---
/stand
---
/dismount
---
/cancelform
---
/cast Innervate
---
That will shift you to caster form and Innervate innervate your target. /dismount and /stand are probably a bit overkill.
---
You can also change /cast innervate to /cast [@mouseover,help][] Innervate. This will cast innervate on whoever you're mousing over instead of whoever you're targeting. 
---
/cancelform puts you in caster form, followed by /cast &lt;insert name of spell you want to cast&gt; will be a good basic macro. 
---
Then there's stuff like:
---
/cancelaura [stance:2] Aquatic Form; [stance:3] Cat Form; [stance:4] Travel Form; [stance:5] Moonkin Form &lt;or Tree of Life&gt;
---
/cancelaura [mounted] Frostwolf Howler &lt;replace with your mount&gt;
---
/cast [nostance] Dire Bear Form
---
/cast &lt;feral charge&gt;
---
This will cancel aquatic form if you're in aquatic form, cancel cat if you're a cat, etc. It will dismount you if you're mounted. Then it will put you in Bear Form, then it will charge. If you're in bear form already, it just skips straight to the charge because you aren't in stance 2,3,4,5, you aren't mounted, and you aren't in nostance. 
---
The first link uses noform while the second uses nostance. It might be that both work or one of those is wrong, but you get the gist of it.
---
My memory
---
Most people tip me about a gold or two.
---
Night elves should have been to but here we are.
---
I tried selling my 'luck services' in BRD Arena runs. 50g if Savage Chain drops since I've seen it wooo many times. I pay 5g if it doesn't.
---
I lost a lot of gold that day
---
Tanking with enchantment shaman has been awful at times. As soon as I charge, before a single auto attack or sunder, they like to blow their shock and draw aggro.
---
Maybe if you werent so inconsiderate youd have some friends from the pug to help you get your bow. Scumbag pug player life I guess. Too bad.
---
I don't find it a miserable experience at all..       
---
No it's not atrocious, nor is it perfect. But looking at some population data and saying "AH! Bad server for ally" isn't the same as playing on it and experiencing it.          
---
If it was such a bad balance, and a sign of doom for ally, then ally wouldn't be controlling BRM a majority of the time, including prime time until there's to many horde groups that are stopped.
---
Anything besides a full BRD run you can do under 2 hours without issue.  You can do a large chunk of BRD in 2 hours, but probably not the whole thing unless the entire group is overleveled for the early dungeon.
---
Being "enslaved" allows me to leave the country on lesiure trips 3-4 times a year. And have a 1080ti+8700k for both computers one just so the wife has something nice.  Alot for ppl my age now a days waste away there 20's gaming or partying. It's going to turn it's ugly head sooner or later on these ppl.
---
Come to earth fury. A lot of us xferred
---
My entire guild did: vendor blues
---
You need to be exalted with the faction that has the mount to ride it if it is not your default races mount
---
Hi Razorgore
---
Alliance here. Plenty of PvPing 60s on both sides it seems, at least to me.
---
You usually hold BRM however, along with Thorium Point, so perhaps that colors peoples perception that its only Horde as you do take 10 kills to run to Brd :)
---
&gt;thinking hunters should have prio on ranged weapons. 
---
They should. The key is understanding what good hunter weapons are (slow, high top end dmg) and what ranged are good stat sticks for melee. 
---
Obv Striker's is better for Melee but gl convincing Hunters to raid with you if they don't get ranged prio within reason.
---
Yeah the aggro thing is real.  When he does that knockback ability, apparently it wipes or drops significant aggro from the 3 targets who get hit by it, so when the tanks are getting hit by that eventually the melee dps get threat and start getting one shot.  
---
As a rogue I just use feint every now and then to keep my aggro low and always survive the rag fight.  Also smart for rogues to pop vanish after they get through blowing all the big cooldowns.  Dps warriors  seem to he outta luck though.
---
Rogues can pickpocket health potions, but the elixirs &amp; transmute are nice.
---
Sounds like he is using the sword from LBRS which is inferior to IBS in every way.  Dude is asking what he can do to prepare for when PvP drops.  Having the skill for the free weapon upgrade he is going to get after his first AV match is good suggestion.
---
I'm with you. never made it past 40 in vanilla and didnt have gold for a mount. I've been SLOGGING through the 50s since phase 2 hit but I'm 59 and stoked to finally hit 60 all these years later.
---
The Horde have a quest that makes them kill an innocent puppy. 
---
So, yes, we *are* at war with those monsters.
---
Wizard oil is p3?
---
As Horde on Grob, I'd say you guys are in a very good position. I don't think it's dominant, but you guys regularly hold down key points uncontested. The Bulwark is fucking impossible and that's right outside one of our capitals.
---
Yeah that dudes an idiot and not the norm. I just wouldn't by any means say this is the most toxic game. Have you ever played Overwatch? lol
---
Dire Maul West has a bunch of invis ghosts. As a tank I love having a warlock so i can see them and not have pulls ruined when suddenly extra dudes show up.
---
I had horrible experiences leveling with warlocks, since hitting sixty they have been amazing for me.
---
Guess I'm getting lucky, but the WL culture on my server seems top notch.
---
Male night elf priest, truly endangered species.
---
Did you duo it with him?
---
Classic is still in its infancy BWL and BGs aren't even out yet. Just level and join in, hell my alt just hit 60 and is better geared than most 60s all about effort
---
skilfully outplaying people in white gear with sinister strike
---
I don't really have moments like this myself, but I've been in plenty of groups where others seem to. I've seen multiple fits of rage over specific items. I just don't really understand how someone gets the mentality that a specific item in a dungeon belongs to them and only them, considering they need the help of 4 other players to get that item to even drop, completely ignoring the fact that it could be good for a number of those players as well.
---
It's nice that you were able to bring yourself back to the real world in the moment.
---
I rolled on Old Blanchy with some IRL friends. I decided to roll an alt on a PVP server and chose Grobbulus for the same reason. Grob is awesome, but it made me appreciate how laid back Blanchy is. The population seems a bit more mature whereas Grobbulus general chats feel like a reddit thread.
---
The fact you have to use hotkeys would make you an inefficient healer imo but the content is ezpz so doesn't matter at this point but in accidental pulls it can be clutch.
---
Can you explain this strategy?  This isn't something I can do by myself or with a rogue friend of mine is it?
---
Sincerely, Mage who is desperately still looking for his reed.
---
I'm not complaining that I didn't get loot in my first 2+ weeks of raiding, I'm complaining that once I finally had the dkp to bid on/win a piece of gear i stopped getting raid invites.
---
Classic Wow will eb around for a while. And people will be running these raids for a long time. You are not late by any means.
---
You'll need to mash the button at least 2x but it should be only delayed as long as it takes you to do so
---
As a Horde player on Grobbulus, it happens to us too.  Admittedly, I've never had 27 corpse runs to get into an instance, but I literally just logged off one day after being mind controlled into the lava for the 2nd time trying to get into UBRS (after 10 corpse runs prior to those 2 deaths just to get into BRM) and being unable to retrieve my body because of where I landed.  That was about 45 minutes of wasted time and I had to use the unstuck feature to spirit rez.  You should really be grateful.  Grobbulus is one of the VERY few PvP servers where Alliance actually outnumber Horde (although not by much).  We're pretty close to 50/50.  Despite the gankfest everywhere, we're on the best server for balance.  Just remember it could be worse... much, much worse.
---
Damn I def need to look into that bc it does sound fun lol
---
Lol ya he is a good priest! Definitely not something you see everyday
---
If that is bad, then this is also bad because of these reasons.
---
Your chance of interacting with the world is much smaller when flying.
---
You skip a lot via taxi service, but once you land you so gotta go out into the world. Small difference usually, but sometimes something in that world might ask for your attention.
---
With flying, your likely to miss those interactions.
---
Hardly. The only other thing that wants that staff is a boomkin. You aren't going to find many mages or warlocks that will give up a mageblade. Meanwhile paladins get to roll on plenty of cloth gear. Don't like it? Take it up with a majority of casters and guilds.
---
Want one big advantage of Shield Slam? If you dungeon run, tons of enemies disarm you, meaning you dont pump out any threat while youre disarmed. But if you have SS, you can still use that, and its massive aggro.
---
Duskwood to.  That’s more my twink hunting ground, and occasional dip into STV from there.
---
You do know they can hate both the Scourge and the living at the same time, yeah?
---
Lucky. Seriously we've been 60 for two months and have been running BRD on average 5 times a day. It won't drop. We've not seen it once.
---
What kind of RNG sayings do you use? What class?
---
Pallys usually ask me to tap to full cause they can give me a free heal
---
You can make iron struts to make target dummies.   Those can drop fused wiring that sell for a pretty penny.  Not sure if it's the most efficient way though,  just a thought.
---
+1 to this.  3 druids and you guys can rotate between specs
---
Eu had 50/50 splitt all servers combined
---
You've missed some stages/developments of the game yeah. That's gone. But battlegrounds, actually difficult raiding content, all of that is still easily far enough away for you to hit 60 and participate in.
---
Don't miss 3/4 of classic because you missed the first 1/4 man. Come join :)
---
But he was specifically asking for advice on what to put effort into that won't be replaced by PvP gear.  Painweaver band is a pretty big waste of time as it is only marginally better than the BRD quest ring and DJB can be farmed in an evening or two if you put your mind to it.
---
Quit moving the goal posts and admit you're wrong.
---
`sorted`
---
But I did play on and experience it...then I left lol. No regrets.
---
Dude it's a game, have fun with it
---
I thought healbot was the end all be all but was informed Luna unit frames is the bee's knees I guess?  
---
 It's like heal bot but it has a much cleaner look imo. I don't know but I'm stuck at work and can't try it untill tonight lol. Then you get heal comm to see incoming heals ? It confuses me cause others say it already detects incoming healing but yet other are saying you need healcomms.
---
Spotted the horde who's been able to use flight paths and zeps the last couple weeks
---
Definitely seems to be the case. Better than Horde at the very least. When I'm running to BRM with an entire army of Horde ghosts to feed the alliance honor farming machine general chat is nothing but Horde complaining about being disorganized and terrible haha.
---
Or he does?  Odds of you seeing a 1/5000 drop TWICE in twenty runs is outlandishly low.  The odds are way better than some rando on the internet is lying.
---
Look at aggregate data combined for both factions on all servers. In general there isn’t that many more horde players then alliance overall when you consider every server combined holistically. If you’re thinking you’re going to get some sort of divine retribution for being camped in the form bg que times then you’re likely to be disappointed. 
---
History will likely yet again repeat itself and alliance will cry on the forums that “horde has op racials and win all the bg’s”. If they stop queuing then the que times will go up. But it won’t initially be a population issue.
---
Some things are worth dying for.
---
Where do I find a blank map of this?
---
I prefer 8/11/32. The Mana reduction on shifting helps too much to avoid.
---
Princess is easy. 
---
1. just toss a couple of heals on yourself during fart phase
---
2. ask dps to hold damage till you get back aggro
---
3. use a judgement of right on her immediately after the fart
---
Classics pace of phase releases should slow down after p3 gets released. You are 100% not to late unless your goal was to try and world first mc, ony, or nef.  There will be guilds running all t1 content for the duration of classic.
---
Artificial insemination works for every sexual orientation.
---
Hell, even UC seems to be Alliance controlled on Grobbulus.  There's always a raid hiding in the sewers at peak hours.
---
It was amazing at first. I agree. But it took away a good chunk of the travel fun. Traveling in wow was so fun in vanilla. And it made a lot of content easily bypassed. I kinda felt like a god on my flying mount. And I did not like it after the initial joy.
---
Didn't they do this in WoTLK?
---
If you keep clicking the target while you have felhunter buff and they are near, you can target them
---
Just group with some 60's of your own faction who are doing the same thing.  You get ganked, they come fight the other faction.
---
If you're not Fury prot, go impale prot. It's better threat than deep prot and for that reason alone it's also superior.
---
Really hope that you immediately logged off and bought lottery tickets...
---
Warlock prolly an officer 🙈
---
Pepper
---
Wpvp is great on balanced servers.
---
And just imagine that Blizzard has actually launched 2 WoW expansion that were "all about the horde vs alliance!!!" (MoP and BFA). Having that faction rivalry back is just awesome.
---
World pvp is only available in classic, it dies a long with every server in TBC, so lets just enjoy while we can before the \#nochangers ruins the game again.
---
Too bad Blizz fucked up by not enforcing faction balance immediately on launch  (which I cried for and was downvoted for saying) and maybe more poeple would have had a better experience with wpvp.
---
They even killed census, so people are blind once again, and picking server is a complete guessing game where you most likely end up picking a dogshit PvE server (anything beyond 40/60 ratio is PvE as far as I am concerned).
---
That's weird, it's awefully green. I think your monitor's messed up.
---
But the Mortar has a 10 min CD and grenades only 1 min? So how is it better? Just to be able to use both every 10 minutes?
---
That’s always awkward cause wtf are you supposed to do with just one binding. It will literally just take up bank space until you can get the other half, which unless he ninjas the other half too, not sure how he will get it
---
item a DPS war look for in MC:
---
onslaugt girdle.
---
crown of destruction ( if he's too broke for the lionheart helm).
---
band of accuria / quick strike rings.
---
striker's mark
---
and weapons.
---
aka 'everything'.
---
Damn, I feel really bad for the healer in that group. You and the tank are both dolts. Of course the ring isn't amazing for a warlock.
---
&gt; Mostly greens/blues with the ony axe.
---
Are Flarecore Wraps actually worth the mats they cost as a priest?
---
They’ve already announced that bg’s are going to be cross realm. And yes we did have cross realm bg’s and battle groups in vanilla.
---
And deep prot even less so. Impale prot is more threat which is all you should consider when you're already using a shield 100% of the time.
---
Well it wouldn’t matter what talents you had because nobody would ever beat a rogue with Adrenaline Rush and Preperation. Throw double imp sprint and even a mage wouldn’t be able to lock a rogue down or survive.
---
I read this really awesome guide recently that broke down threat, aggro, etc. It was saying that range characters have to be doing 130% damage/healing that the tank is doing to pull threat. For example, tank is doing 100 dps, healer is doing 130 hps, healer pulls threat. I’ll have to find it and link it.
---
Edit: [warrior threat guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
&gt;"this took place in Classic" and "is considered unsupported by \[their\] teams"
---
Shit like this, and the gold trading between classic and retail being "unsupported" (not that I agree it should be a thing in the first place), and the lack of action or acknowledgement of bugs that have been present for so long make me think they're really trying to put in as absolute little as they can financially and in terms of manpower for classic. Like they're going to let it run its course, tack TBC on at the end and continue to do the same.
---
It's incredibly frustrating to hear that they would have logs of your entire interaction, can obviously track down where he went and his new character name, but are unable to help you in any way. It's an absolute joke.
---
ok
---
I love when Priests know to bubble for the hellfire... it is a glorious spell that requires some attentions to detail and only to be used situationally.
---
yeah I suggested as much but people get mad if the rogue questions the tank(s). I think it's his usage (or lack thereof) of heroic strike.
---
With the right gear and oeb, you shouldnt be getting outdone
---
I didn't realize it wasn't the same victory music for both sides, I've never done a BG as horde.
---
Nope pve
---
There is no 150 riding in classic. The only skill you need is the one to ride that races mounts(Horse riding for Humans, Kodo for Taurens etc.) The frost wolf/ram mount does not require a riding skill, just exalted with AV to buy.
---
you're part of the dominant faction on a server overwhelmingly lopsided for horde.
---
This post wasn't meant for you...
---
I'm gonna go with this one
---
thats why the correct way to sit and drink, is to life tap as much health away then eat conjured food and water. The food will get you back the same as the (now) missing mana does.
---
I would propably flame as hell and rage quit afterwards when I finally see dal rends drop and a hunter has the audacity to need on it.
---
Imagine having to pay your guild a raid fee
---
I think they originally wanted to add flying combat or something...but then just decided to make flying an easy way to skip everything in the world.
---
Yes, they also regret LFG/LFR.
---
But its too late for now, retail is completly irredeemable as far as I am concerned, there is no way they can fix the game without doing massive and radical changes which will piss off all the current retailers.
---
Just split the game into 2 games like it is now, one good and one whatever retail is.
---
Yeah, find a group of mobs, nova blizzard and cone of cold, rinse repeat for ez 100g an hour, or be lazy and sell water food and ports for ~50g an hour
---
Name and shame.  If he changed his name on the new server, try track him down with the help of people that knew him and destroy his reputation.  
---
The guys are cancer in game and probably are the same cancer IRL.  There will always be people in this world that take advantage of others for the own personal gain at someone else's expense.  I dont care for that.  
---
Let's track this POS down.
---
Back to "different experiences", I've done nearly all of those in some form or another, and had them fail anyways due to roving deathballs, or warlocks, or the spy addon. I expect the popular areas to be camped, but it's disheartening when it feels like you can't get away from it even if you're deliberately trying to.
---
By fire be purged
---
Consecration is a holy talent in vanilla? God damn pallies were wierd.
---
Another tip for Onyxia is to build up full rage in def stance during P2, and when she lands you empty your rage bar, go into berserker, pop Recklessness, back into defensive and chug a mighty rage potion, that'll give you a bunch of snap threat from the crits as well.
---
Fair points.   
---
However, I would like to know where you are getting your information that you based your "don't have enough PvP alliance players to ever make this fair" argument on?
---
Arms with Windfury is still big damage.
---
There were no x-realm BGs for MOST of vanilla, they put them in toward the end of it. I remember loving it because it made all of my queues effectively 0 (maybe 3-4 mins tops) when they were previously half an hour or more.
---
There are a bunch of addons for that, [Prat](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0) is the one I used.
---
What build is the rogue?
---
r/Bigglesworth
---
They have already announce that it is cross-realm, and no-changes is misleading because they already made fundamental changes to classic vs. Vanilla.
---
Well gold is used for upgrades, so upgrades&gt; upgrades? Not sure how that works lol
---
You are still being outdpsd by them. 2h fury is also miles better than arms.
---
Flurry on its own is better than the whole Arms tree.
---
The sign of a problem to do a 2-3 hour raid once a week? The end game that adds progression to anything once hitting 60? Of course the gear is worth it. If your guild is begging a rogue that afk's most of the time and doesn't do dungeons or participate to show up to raid I can promise you they aren't flasking or spending a shit ton of gold on an MC run.

Are you alliance?  Maybe it's just bias, but it feels if anything, more like 60/40 Horde than 90/10 for sure.
---
Probably 75% of the time I go to Lights Hope in EPL, it's camped by Alliance.  Dungeon entrances like Strat/Scholo are a mixed bag.  And I swear, every time I go to BRM, it's Alliance dominated, as is TP Flight path (I play during peak hours mainly).  
---
It seems like Alliance is more organized in setting up wPVP groups in WPL/EPL/BRM, and Horde generally react to it.  I'm not in a top guild or anything, so won't speak for the higher end groups.
---
Leveling an Undead warlock right now (just hit 13). All of the Apothecary quests are, "This new plague is to wipe out the Humans! ...and the Scourge, too."
---
They seem to tilt closer to "Kill all humans and Scourge Undead!" rather than "Kill the Scourge!" with killing humans as an afterthought.
---
The only riding skill in vanilla/classic is the riding for the specific type of mount.  Once you buy that there is no higher level riding skill for epic mounts.
---
Reminds me when I was doing the 25 man hardmode Ulduar fight as melee. All I did was my role on interrupt duty. Doing no real damage and just sitting there finger on the interrupt button waiting my turn or we wipe.
---
Is it somewhat soothing to know that the dalrend set is bis for hunters too?
---
Is there an official post on this? The only thing I found was an interview done in May, which is hardly evidence for anything.
---
Most of the time. Sometimes we brought in lowbie casters so they could get banthoks and cyclopean band.
---
Im chillin dude. Got a good guild with good hunters that would never gimp their dps w a strikers mark. All our hunters have full t1/t2 and rhok delar for months and will get their xbows shortly after bwl release. 
---
Meanwhile you will be spending hours trying to kill Razorgore in a pug hoping for some t2 bracer drop lol.
---
I just try to spread knowkedge that huntards shouldnt take non - leaf weapons in MC so theres less huntards running around. The state of your class is pathetic . 99% of hunters are absolute dogshit braindead players that will take amy gear they lay eyes on.
---
As long as the shield is up you get 22 mp5. That's an incredible amount of mana regen, which is more beneficial to the Priest than the Mage who has mana regen abilities (Evocation, Mana gems). And it's frankly trash for PvP - 500 shield is barely worth it, and there are better trinkets with more utility you should be using (PvP trink, Nifty Stopwatch, Tidal Charm, etc.)
---
Go figure, satisfied players are playing the game not posting on the forums
---
This is outrageous!
---
How do you handle the bats that silence?
---
I thought that was just a schematic.
---
The worst thing is he let the kid in!
---
That's just me giving you credibility.
---
Yeah plus the server keeps disconnecting all day...
---
It's against the sub reddit rules. I will only do so given explicit permission by the moderators.
---
On my server, yeah there are usually Horde inside/nearby IF, trying to get fights.
---
There are also Alliance doing the exact same thing in the UC.
---
The best bracket are 29 and 49.
---
^ This guy's never played on Heartseeker
---
Where in interface options? I know its dumb but I do not see it.
---
I think people need to realize a healer at full mana at the end of each pull, with mages drinking and the warlock having to self sustain is such as waste. Since we convert their mana pool to ours so efficiently, healers should encourage the lock to actually increase his dps. If the lock is over-zealous just tell him, if he doesn't listen let him die. I just hate the inefficiency either way.
---
Its a tie on ZT Eu. But mostly owned by alliance
---
I'd continue to escalate. Especially since the first GM you talked to didn't seem to see it the same way the last one did. Responses between GMs can be varying. 
---
Sorry that this happened to you. I am glad to see that they will be disciplining the account that took the items. You may want to make a separate ticket regarding the restoration of the items if possible.
---
This probably won't help you out now, but could help others: For very expensive deals, I suggest screenshotting text of the trade details. "OK, materials + 200g for the helm" or etc., because they *do* consider text via in-game channels to be a binding contract. If you made the deal verbally over discord or something, then no, they don't have a record that you're actually having him combo it, and that you're not just giving him the materials.
---
Honestly. Tankadins are a Mage’s best friend. I’m sorry to see your whole class relegated to Healadins only.
---
You couldnt fly in TBC until like...68 or 70....sooooo you must be referring to a later expansion when they allowed you to get a flying mount at a lower level.
---
But yes they literally designed the world with flying in mind.  There are some places you cant get to without a flying mount.
---
Well, we at least get some priest drops (disc here), but there has been a vastly greater number of lock and druid drops than anything else.  In fact druid drops have been so insane that we have been disenchanting them.
---
&gt; can you imagine only having a ground mount in Outland or Northrend?
---
Well you originally didn't get flying in Outland and Northrend until 70 and 77.  Outland only has a few things gated by flying and they could fairly easily drop in a few flight points and/or trails to take care of that, the only real problem with removing flying altogether would be what to do with Netherwing and Skyguard factions.  As for Northrend, the only two zones specifically designed with flying in mind were Storm Peaks and Icecrown, they could probably limit flying to those zones and I think it would be fine.
---
They have enough DKP to roll on whatever cause they put in alot of time prior to this current raid.  DKP isnt the best if you want to get the gear to the right people but it is absolutely the best if you just want to reward epics to your best attenders and the ones that have been there the longest.
---
Oh my god
---
You’re saying the official interview where blizzard developers say that bg’s are going to be cross realm is “hardly evidence for anything”?
---
I got that reference!
---
Brokentooth is 1.0
---
Nope, not really.
---
Half threat divided by the number of mobs you pull.  So if someone pulls 5 mobs, and you heal for exactly 1000, you've developed 100 threat on each mob.
---
Where shit tends to go sideways is when the heal, or AOE goes out early, or when the tank has a string of dodges/misses during their initial "alone time".  Pally AOE works great because consecrate scales above the threat produced by AOE healing.
---
I just left my guild after my first raid because they told me they don't want to bring a second Ret Paladin to the raid anymore.
---
- What can I do to be useful to a raid as a Ret Pala?
---
I already got the Battlechicken and Deathray because I have read that these are very useful.
---
Any tips are welcome.
---
What the fuck are you talking about?  I just said that retail is harder. 
---
 Just last post you inferred that classic is harder than retail, unless you just didn't use grammar correctly.
---
&gt; stealing loot from the proper classes that need it.
---
If it's my bis, I need it. So do you? Cool. 
---
You do not deserve leather more than me just because Blizzard shafted us.
---
so u gave ur shit away and he ran away? and u want mom and dad to help? unreal
---
I can understand that for sure. But, that is a differwnt argument. You know?
---
Yep, that's the spot.
---
Bro I had pugs in MY guild's MC raging that I won a roll for blastershot launcher. I was the only hunter and I was using verdant keepers aim. Fuck em' my DPS is lit. Also I'm on Kromcrush hit me up if you wanna bash some nerds with your new rhok. -Bigbow, the troll with a gun.
---
True, unfortunately any lock who uses the felhunter to counter rogues is gonna have a bad time. Succubus' seduce is too valuable to sacrifice to find someone first.
---
I take “100-0ing” as you were the one that did their entire health bar in damage, like a solo kill. This is more impressive than that, because he kills them with his opener.
---
At the server start many people didn’t want rogues in their groups, so I’d just offer tanks 10g to pull together a run for me.
---
I’m a broke rogue, but at least I got my runs in!
---
/chuckles in pve
---
UBRS you mean.
---
You just said dps warriors roll on everything. As if they are somehow the problem. You have an incredibly selfish viewpoint to the point that you are delusional. I would say that makes you a bad person, yes.
---
Not until agility enchants
---
Isn’t the whole point of silent bidding to not be able to know if you are outbid?
---
Felt kinda harsh to me first but it’s okay nowadays.
---
Third week, warlock has full T1 and T2 helm. Checks out.
---
Alot of people can't look critically on their own actions :)
---
No-- only the original WoW CE pets are available. There is no way to redeem TCG or other promo pets in classic.
---
This was over whispers in game.
---
You could also get barbarous blade, peacemaker, or dw BSH all of which is way easier to get than the two dalrends with negligible difference in actual upgrades and you dont have to be an asshole to others
---
With the number of people and the number of aoe you could probably just walk thgourh before the server and enter the dungeon before the server realize youchould take damage because it's probably dying
---
In Vanilla wow GMs would reverse wrong item selection from quests, replace deleted items. 
---
Would restore whole characters inventory in the event of a hacked account.
---
They used to go above and beyond. Now they just want your 15$ and to be left alone.
---
Amen, that's what I do as well
---
It'll refresh the duration of the HOT
---
multiply that by 5-7
---
You need to open a thread on the CS forums. Vrakthris will take care of it but you need to do it ASAP.
---
It may be setting a bad precedent, but I value my time to be worth more than 10g
---
he didn't 'give his shit away', he traded it to someone with a rare crafting pattern with the expectation that he'd get the item crafted for him. you know, a basic exchange that has been happening since the game launched with all crafting professions.
---
Yeah why would you want the bidders to know if they were out bid if you're doing a silent auction?   
---
Just do an open bid system lmao.
---
Ret is the only Pally spec for leveling, you can't get that mad over a leveling weapon.
---
Honestly nothing pretty much. 0-1 is what guilds will have including the casual ones. And even then just because they are apparently the best Nightfall carriers in phase 3.
---
I have a stormrage cover, two pairs of cenarion boots and a cenarion shoulders in my bank cause I'm the guild enchanter.  I was gonna save them for nexus in like 5 phases but seems pointless now
---
My thinking is the same
---
an idiot and his loot are easily parted.
---
Why do you think they keep adding new mounts?
---
Dire Maul wasn't supposed to release until Phase 2, yet it did. Phase 3 was announced to include BWL with Battlegrounds yet it will not include BWL the same time as BGs. All I'm saying is that a lot has been said and Blizzard has changed the timeline they implement new content into the game not once since launch. This applies to cross-realm BGs as well.
---
What? I didn't give anything away. We outlined a deal. Not only that, I was ok with waiting to craft it and he said he wanted his name on the helm to advertise his services.
---
Wait, how does this work? Could you literally just camp a boss and spam resets until you get the gear you want?
---
Pretty not worth imho. I used the +healing bracers from Incendius and if you dont want to farm that you can get +33 green BoE which are basically the same.
---
Love how crisp this one is.
---
World pvp was dead when they started allowing people to queue up for them in major cities instead of the actual BG instance portal.  All that world pvp in arathi, hillsbrad, and ashenvale was because of the BG portals.  Back then, raids on astranaar and crossroads were common.
---
It still isn't really doable without a taunt. That is the most crucial thing tanks need, they received a taunt in tbc and, speaking as a Kara pally MT, they tank wonderfully in tbc because of it. But in vanilla, it might be doable for non-endgame 5-mans while levelling, but it just isn't wise to have a pally fulfill that role in anything else.
---
File the lack of taunt under 'hybrid tax'. I have to contend with this often on my druid :(
---
It helps. 
---
A little.
---
A guildie of mine does exactly this, he offers portal/water/food services wherever he is and between about 50-60 he's made 600G~ from portals towards his epic mount.
---
It all depends on availability and whether you mind running to people to give them portals, but there's always good money to be made there without a whole lot of effort.
---
Why don’t you have a spell bound to 2
---
If you have any screenshots of that, providing them will help greatly. Good luck to you, and again, sorry that this jerk got your mats.
---
I just stayed back and let him do all the dmg. if I pulled aggro and fade was on CD I'd shield and renew both of us before I got silenced.
---
&gt; I can't help but also feel that there's going to be less gear-stress and competition if I just heal. I feel pre-raid BIS is less important
---
This is more or less correct.
---
&gt; I think a Shockadin/Holy Reck could be more versatile and in demand than a Fury Warrior.
---
Neither is really highly desired for PvP. People will prefer pocket healing pallies &amp; MS warriors.
---
Friend of mine won a Murky pet at Dreamhack winter 2005 that he redeemed. Lent his account to someone who change the account info and never gave it back.
---
 I fade almost on cooldown. I'm actually leveling Holy spec, and my heals crit a lot....
---
It will solve the problem by forcing people playing on other fraction/realm.
---
Lol it was Sunday

---
This happens all the time with opening lockedboxes. I pick the lock and just leave trade open until they tip and if they don't after 10 seconds I just cancel.
---
Cross realm bg’s were available in vanilla patch 1.12. And blizzard has said on two occasions in official format both written and interview that it will be available. There’s more evidence to suggest that bg’s will be cross realm. What evidence do you have that they won’t. And for what benefit do you think blizzard wouldn’t have cross realm bg’s?
---
Give ret palys crusader strike
---
You literally just have to kill one pack of guys in order to see him from the service entrance
---
The point of DKP is to award the players that are there the most and put forth the most effort into raiding. If you are a trial member, or a new members just starting out raiding you shouldn't expect to get a piece of gear that someone has been looking for, for weeks or months. 
---
You will probably get left overs until you've attended enough raids to compete with other players for the real rare / good stuff.
---
The amount of information your UI gives in such a compact format makes it feel like a tactical layout, it's awesome!
---
Maybe his Brokentooth just died/abandoned him :(
---
Theres no training required for epic mounts.
---
I heal a Warrior. Having a ret pally join us is my favorite thing lol.
---
looks like default grid
---
This is a 500IQ post right here.
---
Oooooh if you are levelling I can see why there would be an issue, I just assumed this was at 60 😅
---
Same here! Except I had to change F4. Alt+F4 was causing some problems lmao
---
Nobody's getting ganked.
---
It's about the implication.
---
Speaking as someone who has tanked virtually every dungeon from levels 20 through 60, the lack of a taunt is annoying but does not preclude paladins from performing well in dungeons. You can use holy shock and judgment as pseudo taunts
---
The mark is really only for trash.  Too much AoE during bosses to make it worthwhile.  But it can drastically speed up trash in 5 mans.
---
The only benefit of doing silent bids but letting you know that you've been outbid is that you don't want to know who you're bidding against. which kinda defeats the point since if its a healing drop theres only so many healers you are bidding against so you would know anyways.
---
Lmao now I'm delusional?
---
Are you me? 
---
I’ll be living in AV pretty much. Sprinkle in some WSG and Wpvp here and there too.
---
Yeah but do they sell? Asking for a friend
---
Can't even blame ya, you do what you gotta do.
---
Bruh, this one hurts melee I bet. Hahaha
---
he spawns in 2 different locations at least. The spot you're talking about and then where the postmaster is from the main entrance to the left. I don't think you can target him from the UD entrance if he's up at the mailbox.
---
My server is pretty even population wise and the wpvp is still boring as hell
---
I think it's pretty overblown considering it's usually not too hard to corpse run into BRM and no one will care when BG's are released in two weeks.
---
Burning Steppes ramp to BRM is usually clear
---
Once again, this is my main gripe with BiS lists: they neglect to mention the varying difficulties in acquiring these items. Aninated chain necklace is vastly easier to acquire compared to Choker of the Firelord. Yes the choker does have slightly more healing power but giving this to healers over all the caster dps is a clear way to signal that the raid/guild don't value their caster dps. 
---
I ended up winning the choker last week as mage over 10 other people after the raid leader said healer/caster dps can roll for interest. Thankfully they probably realized it would've been a bad idea to award healers with it during loot council deliberations.
---
Never had a problem convincing people to let me tank dungeons oh, but of course we wouldn't be invited to main tank a raid
---
You'll have this stance until it happens to you, weeks of farming down the drain only to get a pre-written response from  blizzard telling you to go fuck yourself. 
---
Scamming has always been against the rules, so has stealing mats. Back in the day they would've punished and restored without question so long as there was evidence. If this was retail they'd return the mats if there was evidence. He's getting fucked over because this is Classic, which makes no sense to me. 
---
I don't know why they suddenly decided to not support this game, but it's a piss poor decision on Blizzards part, especially if they're going to leave the trading system the way it is without trying to make it better.
---
True, but an agi loaded rogue is still going to one shot some twinks who focused on massive spell damage. Because 19. 
---
I’m looking forward to twink v twink bgs, but 39s are going to be so much better.
---
It's almost as if the vast majority of the world didn't come from anglophone countries. Funny how nature do dat.
---
I was there! The best part was the rogue evasion-tanking rag which let Owl and Big? Push the last DPS through. Congrats to all, we cleaned it up Magestically :)
---
I love this one a lot, tons of information, great screen economy and very tidy, well done.
---
Actually, in Vanilla stuff like this was monitored. And GM's would look at the chat logs, see what happened, and remove the items from the scammer and return them to the orginal owner. 
---
Back in vanilla blizzard didnt want this kind of toxicity inflicting its userbase. Now it seems like dont care.
---
I don't see enemies everywhere, but there's zero reason to use LC unless you want to loot whore for yourself or your friends so guilds that use it are basically advertising that fact.  Even a LC run by people who genuinely are trying to be fair are still going to be worse on average than a DKP system.
---
Phase 3 when we get 15agi to 1 hand phase 5 we get 25 agi
---
It is the only idea that can save the game.
---
People have canceled their sub due to it, because there's nothing for them to do. No one wants to spend 1 hour getting to BRD (one of the longer dungeons) and then pray no one drops or you'll have to wait at least another hour for them to arrive. 
---
Casuals are punished as is, so changing something that MIGHT punish some casuals to prevent casuals from actually being punished is 100% the smart decision.
---
If they aren't going to nerf horde leveling experience (like 7 dungeons with easy access that alliance have to spend a long/dangerous journey going to), nerf horde racials, improve paladin's "fun" (its very good, but poorly designed), and do other things to naturally encourage balance, there's no way this problem will sort itself out.
---
edit: I also didn't bring up everything horde has advantages for, for example world travel is way easier/safer on horde - boats have 40 non elites while horde have better guards and safer zeppelin entrances (you dont even need to be flagged to get on).
---
You just have to know what you're doing and communicate with the group if needed. If a shaman can tank endgame dungeons and even raids without a taunt, paladins should be able to as well
---
Other hunter in my guild has blastershot too. He's had leaf for a while but gave up on rhok for the time being. He said its impossible to get it done. I may try a demon or two tonight. 
---
I'd love to bash some nerds. Inopeth - hunter with strikers mark.
---
I'd argue that it would be a net positive gameplay experience. Maybe it's just my personal opinion, but I'd rather sit in queue for 30 minutes than add 30 minutes (minimum) corpse running like alliance has to now to any instance on imbalanced servers. At least with queue you can do other things, log in early, etc. And honestly, with the amount of server problems we've been experiencing with larger numbers of players than originally in vanilla, I feel like a slight decrease in the number of players online at once wouldn't hurt. And I have to question where you're getting the idea that alliance doesn't have enough PvP players. I don't know about all servers, but on the 3 or 4 servers that I've been on, alliance is heavily outnumbered overall, which directly leads to being heavily outnumbered in PvP. I know a ton of people would be much more open to PvP if they don't have to expect being outnumbered 3:1 at almost every single encounter.
---
I feel like there is something missing here because blizzard does restore items when scammed like this.

Sort of.  Being firm without being mean is a skill - "Bob, I'm trying not to sound like a broken record but if you keep pulling, we are going to keep wiping.  Take it off your bar if you have to." and finally "I owe it to this group to get us through this instance, and we can't do that with constant wipes.  Best of luck in your future groups.  /kick"
---
Tying behaviors to the group's success and avoiding a referendum on how "good" they are helps.  Framing a refusal to use support skills as disrespect to the group (NOT to you specifically) can help too, that way they can't play the "who are you to criticize, you're not perfect" defensive card.
---
The Robe pattern in LBRS dropped. I won it, and gave it to the only Mage in the group. I didnt know him prior, but he was stoked, like he just got his BiS and was farming this for the last 3 days happy, not lol I just billed this noob for 90g happy.
---
The other 3 members called me naive, but IMO that dropped for him. Hes ths mage, hes a tailor. He should get it.

Now I get free water and ports for life from this dude

No, its way less than fury. Arms dps is a joke.

No.  No they shouldnt.

I know right? Part of what started my overhaul was learning this too.

You can life tap with it, does not count as damage towards the shield.

Lol what are you guys talking about. There's already a significant reduction for lower level players and one has to split honor in a group, making those raids you see actually really inefficient.

that’s a good point.

If that's the case, than my point of the longer queues will likely be alleviated by this. It will be interesting to see how they decide to create the battlegroups, however. I have a feeling that one of the factions, no matter how they mix and match, will have substantially longer queues for battlegrounds, which will slow their honor grind.
---
But druids are not paladins
---
Fuck yeah, you get it
---
After the first week people were already rank 3, so you can gain more than one rank.
---
Yeah but can you imagine how hard we'll roast him when we have mounts at 40 for FREE and he doesn't?
---
💯 agree with this. Tons of geared out players in my experience alliance out in hinterlands and Tanaris. It’s not much of a challenge when your in full T1 with a T2 helm vs a  level 50 🤣
---
I use to farm the first boss of DM N as shadow. 20-40g per hr depending on drop luck.

Thank you!
---
What do you mean it's not too hard to corpse run into BRM?
---
&gt;This means 60s won't gank underleveled and undergeared players for honor
---
Definetely dude
---
&gt; will definitely BG a ton
---
&gt; less interest in PvP
---
Seems we agree but disagree
---
This is all of the screenshots I have. It was as simple as this, unfortunately.
---
Yay - thanks
---

"I get 8 pce tier set and bow   and melee weapin just for me... but I also want these other bows and rings warriors want. Fucking assholes roll on everything." Melee dps go for weeks w 0 upgrades cause of how little loot we get in MC. Then strikers mark and a hunter takes cause "dps warriors roll on everything". That is the definition of delusional buddy.
---
Catching higher level fish does not increase the rate at which you gain fishing points though.
---
Not inefficient enough apparently
---
Theres just a tiny difference between and addon that was super intrusive and gameplay breaking, and a classes ability. (Saying this as a rogue myself)
---
Be happy that spy is broken because that was making a rogues job 50x harder than it ever should of been.
---
Paladin Party would be a good guild name for a guild of just pallies
---
 Guys just be thankful they listened, stop demanding stuff like working chat, its not as easy to fix with so many players.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias
---
I did not know that, thank you
---
Everyone need prevents situations like these from happening. Valuable BOEs is an everyone need situation. One guy doing it after everyone greeds is a shitty player though.
---
Lol nope.
---
You sound bad. Are you bad?
---
Are you me? I gave up on Glad after 30-40 arena runs. Never saw Gorosh once.
---
I understand how and why guilds use dkp systems. The problem is that once i finally had more dkp than a few officers, guaranteeing a piece of gear, they stopped inviting me to raids.
---
I mean if its all his mats, then I dont see why whats wrong with having a guildie to craft it for him to sell it. 
---
If you provide the mats for +30 spellpower and a guildie enchants it for it free, whats the difference between that and this?
---
&gt; it did solve the problem of loot drama in retail.
---
lol i'm not sure if the solution of "everyone stops playing because they hate it so no there's no problem!" is a good solution.
---
I don't get how you can live with yourself after scamming people like this. It could be that his account got hacked. But then they wouldn't transfer servers I suppose.
---
In my opinion a scammer that does not exploit the game mechanics is part of the game and no items should be restored. There are two ways I would see how he exploited game mechanics.
---
* He got hacked. Then they used to restore you character iirc. All trades that did happen in this period should also be restored I suppose.
---
* Transferring servers to disguise your identity is something that actually should not be possible. In a game were you can't change your name it is kinda weird that changing servers would solve this problem. You could argue that this is exploiting the server transfer feature. No right to be forgotten in wow imo.
---
Oh, me and the RNG have a pact, in that I'm the team's lucky grasshopper. A lot of my runs have really lucky drops... but none of them are for me.
---
Got forbid your guild picks fun at you.
---
I’m not sure if it is but it’s not like blizzard can find out. What are they gonna do, snitch and say some dude Venmo’d me to run brd?
---
You get it
---
Sure thing. It can be very lucrative just grinding out fishing skill in wailing caverns and selling the deviate fish. You'll still get to 300.
---
You traded a stranger and got scammed. Sucks m8 but this isn’t blizzards fault
---
The thing is, you have to play a Ret Paladin not as pure DPS, but as a DPS/Support hybrid.  You're not there to do max DPS, you're there to heal, use your utility, and whack things in the meantime.  The DPS meter doesn't tell the full story of the help you brought to the table.
---
I'm leveling one right now to raid as because my guild can't even field a full raid and has basically no paladins at max level in the guild.  My blessing and JoW &gt; 0 blessing and no judgements.  We have a lot of priests and a decent amount of druids so healing is pretty well covered.  There's a surplus of warriors, so my warrior was both behind the gear curve and very redundant and would've taken me forever to gear up.
---
I only have the wotlk collectors edition stuff :( Lost all my vanilla/tbc boxes.
---
I mean people watch asmongold don’t they?
---
You basically need to "no life" the game in order to get rank 11.
---
I found some of your quite great, at least compared to the current system. However, as you acknowledged, it would likely only work if they scrap battlegroups in favor of free server transfers. I see benefits and disadvantages with the technicality for both of those options.
---
I've only had good experiences with crafters, but I was never very careful because I assumed Blizzard would help if it went wrong. If it's their policy not to help with scammed players, it's a big problem for the longevity of classic since they clearly have a different opinion for retail. 
---
Try tweeting @BlizzardCS to see if getting it out in public will help your cause. Maybe you can get the attention of a large streamer, too, which they might pass to their followers. Negative feedback from a huge number of customers is always the best way to get a company to change their policy.
---
RIP to our balanced server lmao
---
Orcs and trolls are monsters? How dare you.
---
Honor + Bgs and arena were far more detrimental to wpvp than flying mounts were.  Having tewards for honor and making bgs the most efficient place to farm it actively discourages those who want gear from doing wpvp. Wsg is short normally, ab has a pretty standard time range for ending. This gives people predictable time frames and garanteed honor for that time investment. 
---
Arena gives a very structured environment for pvp, and with little effort or cost you get epics that aren't too inferior than raid gear for pve, and superior than raid gear for pvp. 
---
Its maddening how few people even consider these and hop on the bandwagon of flying killing wpvp. With flying you are still out in the world.  Generally farming, or doing the dailies they introduced.  Both of those still will lead to player interactions happening.
---
What is "track invisibility"?
---
The stakes are much higher in Wpvp than it is in battlegrounds. If you die in Wpvp you are gonna have to walk back, lose the farming spot or resources etc. In bg you just get 30 sec AFK time-out before you run back.
---
Wpvp is just less "deathmatch" and thus just way more fun for me, and the grudges people get are also awesome. Killing your rivals on sight (which for me is every alliance player I see), and getting people to bring in more people to form organic pvp events.
---
Battlegrounds just can't be compared.
---
I don't recall the name of the control but it is a drop-down selector, with "none, percent, number" as options
---
Succubus seduction
---
Pvp trinket now that we have it (rank 2)
---
Oh that still sounds kinda nice. Could you do that for Mara to get Emerald Falls each time, or would it send you to the actual beginning?
---
if you are in the game it is playable. figure it out child
---
afk tornado
---
Yes that is very common I would say
---
&gt;Never really stopped to think about these in this light because I was too focused on dying to Horde heroes.  
---
Oh yeah....I need to actually try that again now that they've finally fixed vanish.
---
im aware. cry is free.
---
If someone stole a bunch of valuables from you irl you wouldn’t call the police? Idiot.
---
I wonder here are so many people saying they got further than in vanilla... So never reaching level 60, how do you even came back after 15 years?
---
Why would anybody watch any streamer? Seems dumb as hell
---
Last night I had a level 58 druid tank in Scholo.  Had no issues but his life did swing pretty crazy on a few pulls(most of the time he would forget to get out of the gas clouds).  I am almost all BIS resto shaman so my experience will be different than if you have a poorly geared healer but I had no real issues at all.
---
The problem you have is a bidding based dkp system.
---
Healing paladins is fun too, I can shield them and not hurt their resource generation..
---
Replace with moonfire for druids.
---
Retri Pala?
---
I just don’t understand why Alliance players continue to play on extremely dominant Horde servers like Herod, Skeram, and Stalagg. There’s still plenty of time to reroll on another server like Heartseeker or Benediction where the server balance is either in Alliance favor or close enough.
---
Adapt, improvise, overcome!
---
I've noticed usually the main reason tanks seem to have issues even at 60 is just not marking. Mark a skull at least. If you don't direct the first Target dps will just dps whatever tab targeting brings up for them first.
---
I set my function keys to be all the different marks. Eg F1 marks skull, F2 marks X, F3 moon for sheep, etc. Makes it super fast when doing pulls. If you mark it and they aren't at least mostly attacking that maybe with some cleave and you're not holding threat that's a different story.
---
Just get 6-7k mana and you're set. It's binary. Either you have enough holy novas to kill them or you don't.
---
Sounds good man, I'll add you when I get home.
---
I wasn't able to Target him through the wall at the Live entrance. But I knew he was there because after pulling two packs I could.
---
I'm gonna find you in IF and kill you repeatedly, just to break your false sense of security.
---
99% of world pvp is running around looking for people. The other 1% is the larger group steamrolling the second group. Doesn’t seem to be much strategy or skill involved.
---
In his defense, he did say:
---
&gt;Ya know, in the same way that dying is a solution to debt.
---
Why does anyone watch TV? Seems dumb as hell.
---
Same thing, but streaming you can talk to the actual person on the screen.
---
You don’t have to be good at the game to be entertaining. The most important thing is just to differentiate yourself
---
You're correct that iron is the most expensive part of making the dummies... instead of selling it though I'd recommend that op makes the targeting dummies himself for the fused wirings.  I made a small killing on fused wirings recently until I saturated the market.  They were going for 7g a piece, now they go for 3 (which is also acceptable...)
---
Looking for advice on professions. I'm totally fairly new to the game(3-4 months). People have been recommending gathering professions but I feel like I am ready to step it up if the reward is greater. Right now I got skinning maxed but I am thinking of enchanting. Is that a good combo? I don't want to prey on various minerals or herbs as a profession. The basic problem is that you have to joustle with other players and I prefer to do my work without much interference.
---
What are some of your recommendations given this.
---
Why is it a dick move?  He was obviously offered this because it is no skin off the BS’s back.  You don’t see the guy who got the pattern sharing his tips for making the item with the other 39 raiders who helped get the drop, do you?
---
They were in guild which is what Blizzard outlined as a trusted person in their response. But I guess in the end they were a stranger.
---
I saw him once and would like to do repeat runs but I don't want to do full clears and not see him..
---
I just can’t stop watching myself, otherwise I would.
---
Damn I didn’t hear there’s only a few left! That’s a shame... even with upcoming phases and stuff?? That’s a bummer
---
Blizzard won't care at all.
---
&gt;What do you guys think? 
---
I think if you didn't want to play on a pvp server, you shouldn't have rolled on one.
---
What server
---
All of the previous episodes are still worth a listen though
---
Ive been doing Guild/Pug rubs for over a month. I have staff of dom, 3/8 T1, T2 Helm, Epic Mana Cord belt(Mag), And Ony Head. 1 Need roll win for bosses 1-9, 1 bonus need roll win once we get to Ragnaros (hasnt happened yet) BoE T1 Epics open Greed roll, but must equip or you get kicked and all class gear open Greed roll. We're 9/10 with 40 Guildies that can do MC. Raid 9pmST Tues, Wedn, or Thurs. 1:30amST is when we finish most nights. Server: Whitemane [H]
---
I rolled a dwarf so that I can be a greedy little bastard \*evil laugh\*. Now I can blame my race for my choices.
---
You can still easily dungeon grind
---
I passed this along to Esfand and RichCampbell, but I'm not sure if they'll see it. This doesn't seem like Asmon material lol
---

---
Graccu's Meat Pie is amazing. Def add that one to your list.   
---
My wife and I are doing most of our Thanksgiving dishes this year from this book.
---
They did do that... in retail. It's one of the many QOLs that comes with retail. No one can tell which changes killed retail tho, thus we are stuck with nochanges classicl.
---
Awwww. There I am. What a great flashback :)
---
If only they could remove titanforging and 2 hour dungeons to make an actually enjoyable loot system.
---
Bliz has been pretty shitty about supporting classic tbh. We had a run with friends and a guy accidentally hit greed on an item he needed. So remembering the old days I told the guy who won to just put in a ticket and explain he would like the item to be given to the correct player. He then posted a screen shot the next day of their response basically saying not only would they not transfer the item but basically said "well now he knows to hit need"...like he didn't know that? what kind of bullshit "haha fuck you" response is that?
---
Not all BGs. AB isn't coming out yet.
---
Also, it's the **week of** the 10th. We don't know that they will be released specifically on the 10th. Case in point, phase 2's release.
---
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers in this bracket.
---
But in all seriousness I feel you. I went to Felwood as a duo druid + priest and we'd spent 2 hours doing 1.5 quests and dying around 20-30 times in the meantime.
---
I don't know which faction you're playing, but Mankrik is the only NA PvE realm that is horde heavy.  Everything else is seriously ally heavy.
---
Or do Holy/DPS Priest 21-26-4 , or 20-26-5 that one of class i enjoyed the most to level. As a human +5% spirit, +5% spirit because of the angel form,  25% of our spirit is dmg, and when u kill a mob/player your spirit double. You max all your gear with spirit and dmg, and you can get up +300 spell damage at level 49. The key is to always do your smite or holyfire and try to get the killing blow. When you time yourself good, u will never have to drink in a whole instance.
---
Nahh I don’t kill lowbies unless they attack me.. I was in wpl the other day, some mage was aoe farming, I charged him and got him to like 20% before I stopped, /sorried and left him alone.. the boy did not move, imagine how many times he’s gotten fucked. This isn’t wpvp it’s me rocking some leveling dude
---
Can't focus target in classic
---
If 10 hrs a day scares you, you wont be getting pvp gear either bud.
---
&gt;99% of world pvp is running around looking for people.
---
If you are on a dead realm, sure. But even then, its fun hunting people down, especally if they are named rivals. Just feels more satisfying that way. A mage killed on you 30 min ago?
---
Hunt the fucker down and destroy him, and if you do its super satisfying, if you find him and he beats you again, call in a friend to 2v1 the bastard.
---
&gt;Doesn’t seem to be much strategy or skill involved.
---
For the brain-dead PvP dedicated raids, sure. But when it becomes guild rivalries over world buffs etc (when ZG and BWL is out) and people will fight organized in BRM, then it will be much more exciting than the current gank-squad shitshow.
---
I am not against BGs being in the game, I just don't personally enjoy them like I enjoy world pvp.
---
as someone who plays on arcanite reaper, i cannot relate.
---
Any guilds on Rattlegore horde side that start raiding around 3-4pm ish? Haven't been able to find one so far.
---
Of course it is. You're using outside resources to pay for in game advantage.
---
And that's the end of the discussion since this breaks Rule 4.
---
Host a hide and seek event in some remote area for people (lvl 1-40?) and make it as fun as possible. Would be a fun thing to do while hiding away from wpvp!
---
Hardest part of this would be targeting macros and such so in that case a large area would be needed xD.
---
Maybe announce it in Barrens chat? Fist person to find you gets the money
---
You need to create a thread on the CS forums ASAP. Vrakthris, the longest tenured Blizzard employee, will take care of you.
---
this is dumb. I got banned for a week for scamming some dude in retail for 50k gold, and 50k gold in legion was the equivalent of like 50 gold in classic.
---
They needed to make the skies more dangerous They could have added mobs that you have to avoid. Or something like would losing your breath if you fly to above a certain threshold to keep people closer to the world.
---
I started at 57. You need to have ~6k mana and power infusion/inner focus. Use all your buffs (Prayer of fort, shadow resistance, inner fire). Divine shield before each pull and wait for your mana to Regen before going in. Alternate between power infusion and inner focus on each pack. Took a little while to actually get a feel for it
---
Cool, but why?
---
    No youre not understanding the point . It says your name, class, coordinates last seen, and has sounds for when you enter stealth or appear meaning anyone who isnt thinking or paying attention now is thinking or paying attention.
---
     further more if you are against a hunter ironically, he can macro so his pet auto targets off of this, and can pull you from stealth nearly 80 or more yards away. This is why your job is easier now, and why hunters are not as bad.
---
Thanks, I'll give that a read when I get a chance
---
Never know when half the Alliance will show up and make it a 5v10! Gotta be safe.
---
They had it in Hellfire Peninsula in TBC. Had those 3 towers you could cap and then it gave the controlling faction some sort of buff (that I can’t remember atm).
---
Have fun writing that paragraph? Go troll someone else
---
Fair point.
---
Was a Guildie. Not a stranger, Guild knew him quite well. If anyone was to be trusted, it would've been them.
---
&gt; bear of bad news
---
Urban Dictionary entry for [Bear of Bad News](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bear%20of%20bad%20news): A Bear of bad news is an large hairy homosexual who has unprotected sex then afterwards informs his victims that he has full blown AIDS.
---
Just move on and dont log on.
---
This answer is incorrect, because at the time of vanilla, there is no way to create new Forsaken.  The plague that is being engineered is at best capable of creating mindless undead, not Forsaken, and is not even done yet at this point - and its aim is death, not conversion, as its just as much a weapon against the Scourge.  The Forsaken war with the humans is much more easily explained by the presence of the Scarlet Crusade - from the Forsaken perspective, essentially, the humans of Stormwind (even though from the Alliance perspective Stormwind didnt sanction that and they are an enemy to them as well) invaded Tirisfal with the intention of exterminating them.  War was the logical outcome of this.
---
Except it's not a stranger ? It was a trusted guild member who other people also confirmed was good for it from his guild. If you can't trust your guild crafters you might aswell just go level every prof on your own and get what you need that way. Wasting even more time and resources than is needed.
---
Wow, such an original comment.  Well done.
---
Kargoz might also be someone to try. He doesn't have a huge viewership on his own, but he runs discussion panels with other streamers who might pass the info on to their followers.
---
I have googled around a bit looking for gear for a pvp set. Do you have any lists handy I can look at?
---
That's why you use a fel hunters paranoia instead
---
Create your own groups and instance grind.  Sadly since you are a lock it wont be as easy as being a healer or tank but you will find plenty of people that just dont feel like making their own groups.  If you can find a like minded tank you can group with it will make it that much easier.
---
Funny how people realize that pvp server are thrash now with the game being farmed in no time.  (btw, even when bg's will be out)
---
Meanwhile im just chilling my PvE server not  finding any black lotus...
---
Ret paladin had the nerve to demand to me (GM) that he wanted the first 2 hander drop in MC. Once I told him not before our warriors, he began to also demand we change the loot rules from Loot Council to DKP or he was going to bounce. So we kicked him out and immediately replaced him with a better pally.
---
Sulfuron can be challenging too if the tanks haven't done the fight. There's a lot of positioning/LOS dangers and that initial pickup can go sideways fast.
---
Unless the raid is flooded with rogues you can assign for kick pairs on the healers and then just aoe them all and it becomes one of the easiest fights.
---
Good luck with that.  Dont forget to add flair.
---
Hold the salt on this guy's meal. He has plenty
---
you want more 2 hour dungeon, or you don't like 2 hour dungeons?
---
and titanforging going away next expac... not that it made a difference for heroic/mythic progression
---
I tanked about a half quick Scholo run (didn’t even get to rattlegore due to time restraints) and the aggro was easy to hold for the most part, I hit 58 before this. Had no problems clearing trash aside from the truck hitters.
---
Well of course he wouldn't, because if he did he'd be contradicting himself. He'd just accept the loss of thousands of dollars worth of stuff to prove his point.
---
This is my fear any time I shit talk our raid to my irl buddy who isn't in my guild. Half the time I talk to him on Steam just to be SURE I never misstext shittalking into /ra
---
If they go glass cannon, they can’t complain when they break.  39s are gonna be fun too.
---
Here comes the pain bitch!!!
---
problem also arise with EPGP, loot council, roll or wathever you fancy.
---
That’s why you should prioritize main spec over off spec.
---
You get to rush ahead and force pulls.
---
This is how you fix it. I noticed it a couple years ago in retail and it drove me crazy til I found the fix.
---
Good anecdote
---
*Laughs in PVE
---
What is a standard tip for 55 water and what’s standard for a portal?
---
Yeah, it would certainly lift his spirits, but it's still a band-aid fix and something like this shouldn't be out of Blizzard's jurisdiction to make right.
---
Ogrimarr, thats a first
---
Congratulations, you know how to link a Wikipedia article. Good job!
---
Now tell me how I'm wrong.
---
sigh.
---
american school system is getting worse after every generation...
---
I have a blast jumping into a pvp battle as a low level. As a rogue I can still cheapshot and kidneyshot a level 60 as a 40ish rogue, and thats enough time for the guards to beat down a cocky 60 Horde killing people in alliance towns. I do shit damage, but I can still help in the fight.
---
I faerie fired a rogue killing people at the SW AH as a level 20 druid. He was confused why he couldn't vanish.
---
You got ripped off.
---
3rd week guild, doesn't mean everyone in that guild has progressed at the same rate.
---
Heh, of course that is what I have sold them for. Depends on saturation though, sometimes I sell for less if massive amounts of under cutters. Like 9.99s for mudsnappers and 49.99s for bristlewhiskers, but I have sold 4 stacks of mudsnappers at 14.99s and 12 stacks of bristlewhiskers at 79.99s. Depends on server though I would imagine.
---
Wish it let you see and interact with the ghost around Scholo
---
This. All of this. Go play on a PVE server. 
---
World PVP is the whole world. With all of the players. One of my fondest memories from Vanilla was helping heal in south shore on my paladin in his 40s.( I rerolled from Mage so I was starting over)
---
If your friend wants to get boomkin gear from raids he needs to find a guild that will accept him as a boomkin and gear him as such.
---
Your friend needs to accept the fact that boomkins are inferior caster dps which is a handicap to your raid during later content.
---
Warriors scale with gear, moreso than any other class.
---
The main thing is you want to hit the 9% hit cap (or 6% if you're human with swords or maces, or orc with axes, you really want to be one of those). Then you want to build up your AP and Crit. I really like crit early on because crit gets you rage faster in my experience. 
---
Ideally Hit Cap &gt; Str &gt; 1% crit=24Agi. There's a lot of resources out there that will give you good item selection. But if you're in greens you're likely not geared enough. 
---
Once you get geared though fury warrior just takes off, basically every point of damage you gain gives you more rage which gives you more damage so it just snowballs.
---
Is there an addon that tracks spawn locations for herbs? With collected data from the start?
---
Barrens hide and seek.
---
...
---
aight. there's only so many moronic argument I can handle at once. I'm gonna skip that one.
---
And lose all that progress? I don’t think realm transfers are a thing yet.
---
Is this the new " I got to wash my hair"
---
Mage: pulls some aggro via too much aoe dmg.
---
Mage: walks backwards away from tank.
---
Tank: turns to try to grab aggro back but sence still have some, constant daze, can't catch up.
---
This has been 90% of mages in my experience.
---
LOL, then don't fucking heal them.  The tears of the healers are sweet to the Warlocks!
---
The only time I had loot drama was back in WotLK. I usually just pass if there's a lot of competition on a piece. I'll get gear eventually... I mostly am there for the content anyway. 
---
Regardless, back in WotLK I was one of 5 hunters in my guild progressing in ICC 25 for the first time. I was force-looted the bow off of deathwhisper, which, according to our loot rules at the time, meant I would be ineligible for other loot until everyone else had gotten something. At the time, this was actually only a slight upgrade for me at this time and there were 4 other eligible hunters to give this too.. but the hunter lead and GM's sycophant convinced him to give me the bow, which prevented me from participating in my roll for Deathbringer's Will (BiS trinket at the time) just two bosses later. I didn't ask for the bow. I didn't even roll for it. I wanted the trinket and was willing to pass on the bow for it.
---
The GM's butt-buddy knew this and did everything in his power to reduce the pool of potential competition. Granted you could argue that if no one was forced to have any loot, everyone would pass and only roll on the trinket... but really that speaks to a flaw in the loot system we had that it could be so easily manipulated from both ends.
---
You're calling it terrible but just gave two examples where BDS is better.
---
Of course it's only really valuable if you're using the set bonuses, but the alternatives are pretty garbage right now, outside of Cloudkeepers and Devilsaur set, both of which cost money (and in Devilsaur's case gets broken by Flameguard Gauntlets).  If you go on raw stats or plug things into a DPS spreadsheet, it beats out every alternative that doesn't include Cloudkeepers or PvP gear.
---
You are also completely disregarding the Fire Resist on it, which is extremely useful for 20-man Onyxia, and doesn't hurt for MC.  Sure, no one cares too much about Fire Resist on a DPS, but it is still a nice thing to have, especially when it comes at zero cost to DPS.

Yes, it'll get replaced by PvP gear or BWL gear, but it has already served some people well for a month or two, and has least a month or two of life left in it until all but the most hardcore PvP farmers hit rank 10 (which is going to take most people far longer than farming \~250g in materials), or until BWL gets released. Even when BWL is released, you have to win said item(s) against other classes.  Drake Talon Shoulders are a very small drop chance off of the Drakes... and some guilds are bringing 10+ Warriors to their raids.
---
Ok, I get that, but do you think that the hunter should have the ability to mark a target before they even show up in game?
---
I had a MC member refuse the summon on the pop-up several times because he thought it wouldn't work. When asked 'Hey man we summoned you several times why are you still walking and holding up the raid?' he stated that he was inside an instance and the summon would not work. It did work, he had just never tried it within the same zone. 
---
As far as summoning yourself goes, it may not occur to some players why they would even want to summon themselves to where they are currently standing. I used the hearth an as example but there are several others: scope out a zone for your map, turn in/pick up a quest. Scout an area for a mob or pvp safety, etc.

It's very niche, but not useless.
---
In Eastern Plaguelands, it reveals Eyeless Watchers.
---
In Dire Maul, it reveals patrolling ghosts.
---
In Stratholme, it reveals Eyes of Naxxramas.
---
In Raven Hill (Duskwood), it reveals level ~50 (passive) ghosts.
---
In the ruins of lorderon, it reveals the level 15 ghosts of dead citizens.
---
In PvP it reveals succubi and players who used potion of invisibility.
---
In TBC it would reveal succubi in Arcatraz and mages using invisibility.
---
It can even be used as dispel fodder.

Don't worry about that guy you are totally in the right here. And blizzard Absolutely should do something about that. The guy you are responding to is an asshole.

I am usually on top of the damage meter. Purely PVE. My main is a level 60 arms warrior. I prioritize Str then agility.

Had a very similar experience on a 55 Druid last night, only slightly fewer deaths. Except I am horde and it was my horde buddies holding down the end of my corpse hopping.
---
Anyway I feel you man, on my server at least. I’ll admit the horde do it more where I am from, but it’s still two ways. Control over black rock mountain still shifts like the tides.
---
Its track hidden, and it's like having the Human racial for free with unlimited duration and no cooldown. Stacks with cats eye elixir too. Provided the rogue in question didnt spec into camouflage, you can see them from a good 20 yards
---
It started to bug out at 7pm yesterday on alliance side, dont know about horde.And its still bad rn with all of these chat disconnects and stuff
---
Yeah, I got the same vibe in my interactions with them. I mean, they said trade with a guildie instead, but it was a guildie.. its like they didn't read my ticket.
---
I think it's less about the immersion and more about having to create larger zones that don't feel small when you are flying.  
---
If they add detail to a large zone to make it both look good and be large enough to not feel small when flying then it wastes developer resources.  If they just make it flat and barren then it just looks bad and is boring for the player.
---
Keeping the game with no flying lets them make smaller zones and use tricks with the terrain to make them 'feel' larger.
---
I'm pretty sure they covered all this when they talked about wanting to remove flight back during WoD and whether or not they could make the removal permanent in new expansion areas.  (They eventually re-added during the expansion due to complaints from the players.)  They've currently reached a middle ground by removing flight for the first portion of an expansion and then adding it during the middle, tied to a fairly time consuming achievement.  
---
It's hard to permanently remove QoL improvements even if you decide later they are detrimental from a game design aspect (if they're still useful from a player power aspect.)

Do people just gloss over the part where this is  was a guildie? 
---
This wasn't some random stranger, he was a well known person in guild. He offered to craft it, and according to blizzards own guidelines he was an acceptable person to trust to do this.

---
He alliance so clearly the horde camped all other areas of the map and this was all that was left to do.
---
The issues you describe with Naz are exactly why they should get rid of it and why people want flying removed. You are experiencing the environment, the world they created, exploring.
---
Who gives a shit about your level 40 in southshore, I'm talking about 50-59 alliance players in searing gorge, burning steppes, plaguelands etc getting steamrolled over and over by lvl 60 horde gankgroups for tiny bits of honor on a server where one faction is overpopulated and no way to fight back.
---
The player supplying the mats is profiting from the player crafting. I think OP should at least tip his guildie. Even if the guildie offers free crafts, those free crafts are probably implied to be used by the person he is crafting it for. If he is using his guildie's time and recipe, he should at least be willing to kick back some of his profit that wouldn't be possible without the helpful guildie.
---
Because the guildie is probably under the assumption that he's helping a guild memeber craft the BiS vanilla helm and will help the guild as a whole... not make some measly amount of profit in the month it takes to sell?
---
You think taking advantage of guild members to make gold doesn't make you a dick?

Its not bad if you can get off the beaten path. And/or can stealth.

Ungoro, for instance, anywhere close to Morgan's rest is a hellscape. Sittng between the GY and Morgan's Rest is risky. Significant traffic. But if you're way out there, you're probably good. If you see someone, dodge 'em, move on. Find the empty spaces.

Its kinda bad everywhere during peak hours on PVP servers. Wife, Brother and I trying to get around Arathi Highlands to do a couple quests as a 31 Warrior/ 31 Priest/ 32 Shaman. Next thing we know we get ganked by a Skull pally. Was able to still do some good damage to her at our levels be no where near enough to win. So my brother and I have to pull out our 60s. He has a rogue, I have a hunter and we have our pre-raid gear. Wife then says a couple more horde killed by a couple druids that are in their low 40s as they killed a 35 horde and whispered her that. Now they are camping the bodies of the hordes they killed according to wife. Brother and I show up finally kill the pally first and then track the druids down quickly and kill them. Wife buffs us with stam buff and now were forced to help her on two 60s as we have to protect her in a 33-37 zone since high levels are killing for fun and no honor. Then with our 60's out were having to fight other 60's all the time. Can't quest as lowbies, we tried to do UBRS rend runs before paying with wife and it took an hour to get in since alliance camped every spot from the flight path up into the mountain. I feel bad for people that arent 60 but at the same time finding myself having less fun as 60 as it takes forever to get anything done since I get killed by 5 or 6 alliance riding around just to get easy PVP honor. If you not in a group as a 60 and traveling alone your more then likely gonna die.
---
:D
---
Nothing wrong with circumventing the honorless target debuff :)
---
I think what I find the most interesting is how the community changed over the years.
---
It's not so different from all those years ago, either we were all more patient or uninfluenced by the full blown aids quality of toxicity the MOBA genre has fostered in gamers.

I just found a blue post stating there was a bug that was assigning raid ID upon entering.  It was fixed on 10/27.  You won’t get a raid ID until you enter the threat table of a boss.
---
I’ll see if I can find it but I’m on mobile and found it on my pc.

The only addons I know of you have to find the nodes yourself.

There is a map that exists with all spawn locations on it but I believe you had to subscribe to the website to gain full access.

If I'm doomed, I make sure to FF every rogue in the gank squad. It ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
I can’t spell bananas without the song.

I mean if you are grouping up in world pvp with a group that big 95% of your fights will be lopsided and the same honor farm the only difference is roaming versus camping
---
I don't get how Classic is treated like dogshit in terms of GM support compared to Retail. Who fucking plays Retail anyways? Classic brings in way more money than even that milked dry cashcow garbage.
---
It is, but if you make the deal outside of wow (discord) they cant prove it. I personally would never pay rl money to have people come to an instance, but you do you.
---
Also having the mage or priest oom is the best excuse for you to sit and drink.
---
The smoothest run on my pally tank is with a mage that oom every fight. I get to sit and drink with the mage.
---
The most stressful run was with rogue, warrior and cat druid as dps who get antsy and start moving towards mobs when I sit and drink. Even if they are not pulling, I still feel I might be slowing them down.
---
You're gonna go far kid.
---
Because their guildies that they raid with aren't absolute shit. 
---
Arms warriors should come in bottom middle of the pack with the new level 60s that don't have gear.
---
Lol thts why I won’t lvl again bro lol I’m saying some ppl just lvl slow simple as tht I’ll prob do it faster the second time around since I know what I’m doing now lol but I didn’t even know how to use my skills before
---
Why did you gnomish shrink ray a mage? I thought it only reduced attack power, am I missing something?
---
can you link this please? we've just had half a raid locked out of MC to a cleared ID just from entering the portal with the wrong raid leader
---
Its just very slow grinding on a rogue
---
I find it easier while leveling to use different types purely to keep weapon skills up for multiple at a time so you don't have to grind it out later. The bonuses from racials or talents won't be enough to matter til youre 60.
---
Eg as a rogue use a sword and a dagger. If you're going combat while leveling which I'd recommend just use a dagger offhand. You won't notice a dps difference while leveling but it'll make changing to a dagger spec later way less annoying if you decide to.
---
Nah, Redridge is the place you go to take revenge after some alliance scum piss you off for whatever reason.
---
Its never to fight other 60s, altough they inevtiably  show up.

WAT
---
I don't like 2 hour dungeons. The reason there's loot drama in classic because a dungeon is like a multi hour long commitment and more often than not, a waste of time.
---
If they did this I'd devote 100% of my play time to ganking lowbies
---
&gt; The key is understanding what good hunter weapons are (slow, high top end dmg) and what ranged are good stat sticks for melee.
---
this is basically it. Understanding that Strikers Mark is a melee stat stick, and not a hunter upgrade. Not just a melee stat stick, but it's basically the best stat stick a melee is going to get until Naxx. For hunters, they will get the leaf from Domo and get a much better bow than Strikers (and even Carapace Spine is better due to aimed shot dmg). 
---
So in that respect, why take Strikers Mark from a melee? It shows a fundamental lack of understanding of your class and how it works, which means you probably shouldn't have a raid spot anyway.
---
This is just poor design.  We didn't know it then, but we know it now.  Blizzard has never figured out how to make WPVP a thing, cause this crap is so heavily encouraged.
---
Impale Prot for sure if ur guild need/want the Debuff Slot even go Deeper into Prot. Fury Prot is for when ur guild is equipped and u want faster Runs btw Speedfarming a Boss. I wouldn`t go for fury prot before Phase 3/4 u need that gear because warrior is rage starved. U need ur hit chance cap, crit chance preferable over 25% just to maintain ur flurry Procs. Think about it this way u need 25 Rage for Shieldslam vs 35 Rage for Bloodlust, so u have to make up for the higher Rage cost just to do the same amount of Threat. With constant Flurry Procs u can make up for the Higher Rage Cost.  Just watch some vids from Skarm where he is talking about Fury Prot when and why u should go for it.  Also ur Healers will have a hard Time keeping ur Health up that means better be fast with killing the Bosses or ur Healers are oom and ur screwed.

Bloodfang EU PvP - For the Horde!
---
Hello, I am looking for a guild to play with on the Bloodfang Server. A guild where its just the right amount of serious, but where having fun is rule no.1
---
I am from the Netherlands, have a full time job and live together with my pregnant wife. Time is valuable. Luckily I get to play a lot still, usually around 2 hours per day, sometimes more, sometimes less. 
---
Because of my schedule, I am looking for a guild that raids anytime between friday 19.00h (Server time) and sunday 21.00h. Ony raids can be during the weeks, if we finish before 21.00h.
---
I hope a guild like I described exists on Bloodfang, and hope I will fit in with you guys. See you soon!
---
I’m 60 doing MC and Ony. Would you recommend blood lust, heroic strike and whirlwind?
---
if you're out pvping you want this and unending breath up at all times. It's dispell fodder so they can waste a dispell dispelling worthless buffs rather than demon skin or a nightfall proc buff or something
---
Alright meow, that's just messed up
---
Alliance or horde?
---
I appreciate it. Thankfully I've worked in online communities in the past and screenshot things regularly.
---
You telling me you know all your guild members irl?
---
I’ve stopped passing by anything that gives me honor. Why?
---
That level 52 will I spared will 100% of the time join in and help someone I’m 1v1ing.
---
Yup, my lvl 2 has perma stealth 😆
---
I mean, you can have your opinion on how 8+ hours a day is insane, but that does not change the fact that 3 hours a day is casual compared to that. My entire guild is at 40+ days /played and so are several other guilds on my and other servers. Hell, with 3 hours a day you won't even get a top 200 standing on the fuller servers and there's absolutely no way you'll ever hit rank 13 or 14. So yes, 3 hours a day is casual in World of Warcraft, I'm sorry.
---
Sounds like some reddit circle jerk to me
---
Nothing missing, he traded mats for a lionheart and got scammed. Person that scammed logged out, server transferred, left all discord servers tying him to the server, never to be seen again. Now he's 700g richer, and starting a nice cushy life on a new server without any negative repercussions.. that is if Blizz hasn't punished him.
---
?
---
I'm trying to understand your reply, I guess you are saying "LOL they will still gank u for honor noob" but if you actually read my original post you'd realize they literally wouldn't get any honor for killing you.
---
Sounds like PvP happened on a PVP server to me bro. You do realize PVP server means that there will be PVP there right? If you want fair PVP it will be out in 2 weeks with BGs. Really sounds like you should have rolled on a PVE server to me.
---
If you are below 60, who cares? Roll on anything you'll possibly use.
---
At least I'd have the option as Holy Reck though. Mostly heal then unleash my reck stacks with a 2 hander.
---
I think it is a poorly thought out idea that would make my PvP experience as a level 56 substantially worse, but I rolled on a PvE server because I played on both in vanilla and knew the only difference was \_when\_ you consent to PvP, not \_if\_ you get to pvp at all.
---
On a PvE server, you consent to PvP only when you flag.  On PvP servers, you consent to PvP all day, any day when you create your character.
---
Honestly, it sounds like you just rolled on the wrong type of realm...
---
We roll so deep that we muster 15 Alliance 60s in hillsbrad at peak times now.

Why the fuck would they allow gold trading between retail and classic??? People on retail have tens if not hundreds of thousand of gold...

Hunters were designed to be a Rogue counter. They were designed to be a pain in the ass for Rogues. Hunters mark was always intended to have a 100 yard range and to piss off Rogues. No.
---
Not sure, first I would need someone else with this mount on my server to compare it to.
---
I do know when I turn into a Tauren with Orb of Deception, and then drink a Firewater, the Tiger/Ram are pretty eye-catchingly gigantic.
---
I would not recommend Enchanting if you don't want to compete with other players. Enchanting is pretty expensive to level. Usually it's paired with Tailoring since you can disenchant what you make while leveling Tailoring for extra mats to level Enchanting, but as your only profession this won't be a great option. If you want to make money off your investment in Enchanting, you end up shouting your services in trade chat which I'm guessing wouldn't be appealing to you if you don't want to deal with interference from other players.
---
Honestly, for money making I think your best option is still Herbalism or Mining. Unless you want to gamble on finding a rare recipe and getting paid for it, but it may be difficult to end up in that position if you're just starting at it now.
---
If you want to craft for fun, Leatherworking is an option for crafting that pairs well with Skinning. Herbalism + Alchemy is also a decent option since you can craft consumables that are always in demand. Engineering's reward is that you get extra abilities in PvE and PvP, though you'll want another profession to make money to help you level it (probably Mining).

Fyi: you can click on a post and hit the save button

I cant believe how a game can go from fantastic to awful in one update. I don't care if I'm wrong about pvp/pve just fucking let me transfer to a pve realm. Ive sunken 3 months to get to 59 and now it's forever unplayable, p3 won't decrease pvp when one in party can que and the rest can keep ganking
---
Counter-point to this - I won a need roll on a significant upgrade ring as a healer over a mage (mind you we’re talking dungeon blues here). Mage claimed I’d “ninja’d” it because it was his “pre-bis” and I had better options available. 
---
I checked a few prebis lists for mages (Wowhead, Icy Veins, a couple of others) and it wasn’t listed - but apparently it still is because the actual pre-bis for mage are both expensive BOEs.
---
So to follow his claim - in a PUG sub-60 dungeon run, if an upgrade for me drops I should be familiar with other classes prebis lists (or quickly do some in depth research) to make sure that I don’t “ninja” something? Should I stay in quest greens until my pre-bis drops?
---
I understand this way of thinking in a raid situation with a knowledgeable loot council but when it bleeds out into PUGs in dungeons it’s pretty absurd.
---
Go ahead, you wouldn't be getting any honor out of it, and you'd be literally wasting your own time as well.  You'd give up quickly.
---
As a level 23 who quested in Hillsbrad last night, I can confirm that I was banked around seven times by ?? Alliance. To their faction’s credit, an Alliance warlock saved my life after I accidentally aggroed a ?? Mountain Lion in Alterac Mountains.

It does despawn I've had to watch a copy of forors despawn off the ground before

Wait, shaman? Endgame?? You're saying there are shamans tanking Ragnaros and Onyxia? Shamans don't even have a threat increaser, much less a taunt, do they rely on rng burst damage from windfury to maintain aggro? Even if they do, they would have to equip a shield which lowers their threat.
---
I would imagine only super well-geared shamans are capable of this. But I wasn't saying it was 'impossible' I was saying, as I said, it "wasn't a good idea".
---
As long as it was a legit upgrade I see no issue. You could defend the arguement better if it is a guild only run. Where it'll last longer for you, which is better for the team. In pug though, an upgrade is an upgrade /shrug
---
How long are your play sessions before you get a crash? I've been having problems with memory leaks where my Mac just shuts down if I no-life for a day.

That or torturing someone to death by MCing them into mobs and letting the mobs slowly kill them.
---
Turns out just because your name is in Danish doesn't stop Danish people from knowing just how offensive it is.
---
No not in my opinion. The staff is a little less rare than the mageblade but you still need a raid to acquire it. Both of those are the LARGEST dps increase for any caster period, out of any item in the game. Its off the table for paladins in all guilds I have been in and will continue to be.
---
Holy shock? How deep into Holy do you go/what do your talents look like?
---
The only responses you'll get opposed to this are people actively farming anyone &lt;60.
---
I think given the drastically increased population per server, as well as how shit of an experience it is to go anywhere near a 45+ zone, I can't think of a good reason not to implement this.
---
The difference between getting ganked and getting totally butt fucked out of pve (minus dungeons) is the tipping point for me. I can handle getting ganked, but when I can't quest /grind / travel through a zone because it is locked down by 60's gobbling up helpless sub 60's, it fucking sucks. We literally stand no chance.

Love how you casually admit to scamming someone. :)

Actually yeah you normally do.  Patterns that drop we ask the people who get them to give at least 50% profits to guild bank.  And then obviously do enchants/crafts for free for guild members.  Someone making a helm to sell means 1 less person looking for the helm craft which means 1 less fee that gets collected to the gbank.

Do yourself a favor and check out “Good Morning Azeroth”!Those guys are insanely knowledgable about everything classic and they are quite entertaining to listen to. They have new shows quite often, though they slowed down a little when classic first released(understandably so). But they seem to be back to their normal content frequency. From them and their podcast, you will also learn about plenty of other wow classic resources/podcasts you can tune into.

If I log in and then log out, even if just a few minutes in between, I need to go and delete those 3 files again or the same crash occurs. Once I'm in the game though, everything is fine.
---
They're very rare drops that are best outside of raids for melee. A hunter has two much better options one of which they can easily solo farm. If hunters take dalrends they're a cunt.
---
Wrong thread?
---
If they dont i do. 
---
Lots of qol updates and eventually you take the challenge and fun out of a game. You think you do but you dont.
---
I ain't got time for punctooashun
---
Might have a chance at getting reset if that blue post is any indication, if you could actually get them to respond to you
---
If you're in a guild, ask them to help. Our guild leader knows the Priests and the Hunter's are having difficulties doing them, so our guild messages have been encouraging guildies to help them. Plus we like to PvP, so we will do what we can to help our guild progress!  
---
I'm a Warlock in my guild and I helped out two of our hunters in the guild to put Recklessness on them to become immune to the demon fear. It was about 7 of us total (including the two hunters) and we killed any horde before they could get to our hunter. Luckily there weren't MANY horde messing with us, so our hunters were capable of doing the quest.

Having a free action potion makes the fight significantly easier for the warrior. All you need to do is pummel, grenade or fear to prevent a sheep and you have a fighting chance.  On my server FAP are 50s on the AH making them worth using for mage 1v1s.
---
I know there are some entries. Katt is a crafter. There is one more off the top of my head. The recipe was just sold on the AH so I thought possibly this person might have it. I see everyone running around with the helmet on so I assumed the recipe wasnt *that* rare.
---
Don't forget that you can queue at the physical instance location:
---
WSG - Ashenvale
---
AV - Northern Hillsbrad/Alterac
---
AB - Arathi
---
We'll most likely see an uptick of WPvP in those areas as people queue then (if they have to wait) roam the world looking for additional honor.
---
I think our most tiered out guys are actually pretty involved and leading the raids. Most of them are being looked at as raid leads for the 2nd raid group now I believe. Great seeing leaders come up in the guild and tackling content!
---
So you rolled need on stam/int cloth as a hunter?  You, uh, do realize that's a pretty dick move, right?
---
Anyone can create a premade. That's like saying guilds are breaking pve raids because it puts pugs at a disadvantage.
---
That would be cool, would be fun trying to find a good hiding spot, maybe something hard to get to.
---
He will also get responses from people on PvE servers saying "uhh... yeah... that's why we rolled on a PvE server".
---
Because the very thing you and OP are complaining about is the reason why blizzard has PvE servers, and why people roll on them.  The rule-sets on PvP servers have been known for 15 years.  None of the stuff happening should be a surprise to anyone.
---
I would be pissed off, if a bunch of non alchemists rolled on recipes I needed just for gold.
---
Herod horde
---
So to avoid giving it to some one that doesn’t really need it I recommend a couple options.
---
1) buy bags, lots of bags. Chill in a leveling zone and wait for someone too say something in general chat that only a new player would say and load him up. 
---
2) buy greens and gear up some lvl 20s-30s that are still wearing whites.
---
3) if someone says they need help in chat send them mail, saying sorry I was busy when you called for help so here is some gold, hope this helps. ( or get creative with it)
---
4) If you can craft stuff spend money and craft a lot of ok or decent items. Send them to the appropriate level/class in the mail saying “ I am “name” duties have called me elsewhere so I will be leaving for a while, please accept this item with my MakersMark and remember me, I do not know when I’ll be back” 
---
I’m sure better ideas are out there just have fun with it. Plus you never know when you will come back and see them again.
---
Sry thorium point

BG's are being released the week of december 10th my dude
---
Hi there
---
Most retail loot is actually a lot more interesting than classic loot.
---
Yeah, I looked at your ticket screenshots and they were giving you pretty bogus advice. Not only "just trade with a guildie" but they also told you "next time try right-clicking on the player and use the Report button" when you had clearly stated that he logged off??
---
That's actually very creative, but they could easily claim they don't have the liquidity to support such a trade.
---
Atleast 1 purge before ur icebarrier Fades and the mighty sulf sham 1shots u :D
---
Are you high? You can't even do it
---
First 2 people to find me have to duel for the prize!
---
still doesn't explain what they meant...
---
Good morning azeroth has a nice hype about the game. They do also cover alot of general and interesting topic.
---
Pre-phase 2 there was very little ganking unless fighting over specific quest mobs or nodes, and that's when people PvP'd "for fun".  So nope, you are wrong.
---
Making the grind right now. Been logging off in BRD lol and just /who and trying to sneak into farm groups.
---
It was a guildie which is why I didn't assume anything crazy. They had their gear.
---
I need some advice on guilds. I just recently got 60 (like 2 weeks ago) and now basically have pre-bis and the attunements. I was a bit slow with leveling because I took a short break (I was getting too far ahead of my friends to do content with them that was meaningful to all of us, so I decided to wait a bit).
---
So I just recently joined a guild, and they use dkp with set cost for items. Consequently I will probably just be getting the scraps when it comes to items, as there are people who have as much dkp as would probably take me 6 weeks of full clears to get. At the same time, I don't think it's unreasonable that people who have been in the guild for longer will have priority; but I'm not sure if I have the motivation to raid in a group where even if my bis weapon drops for 6 weeks in a row I still have 0% of getting it unless the high-dkp people just don't show up; for example. Thoughts? (I haven't raided outside of pugs ever so perhaps I'm wrong about some of this)
---
What would your advice be in general to someone who wants to start raiding now? Just invest in being in a guild which clears raids without trouble? Look for a guild with a loot system that has less disadvantages for newcomers? What system in general use would that be? Or should I just pug until BWL comes out and join a guild then, when some guilds do a soft reset of DKP and the like?
---
Yeah I agree, I'm a priest anyways was just pointing out that they are not even bis atm
---
Where does the server populations fit in the "nochanges" dogma?
---
Although this sucks...welcome to the internet. Every person should know not to trust trade someone unless you research a vast history of vouches and reputation. Getting scammed isn't the developers fault and the items should not be restored. This was a life experience that you learned from (hopefully). We've all been there in one game or another.
---
I'd be more upset that you were so misinformed that you took a downgrade from someone that would have benefited massively from it. The bow is a great stat stick for melee, and a sub optimal bow for hunters.
---
You want input? It is a terrible and dumb idea. A skilled 56 can kill a 60, a skilled 53 with engineering can kill a 60. So what you want is a level 60 getting no honor even if he fights against someone who can kill him. There's a reason why 48 is the cutoff for honor and not 59. 
---
A smarter idea would probably be zero honor if it's like 10 vs 1 to discourage raid ganks and promote more small group PVP.
---
Truth, rogue main here. You can still vanish out of it though.
---
Then a rogue came and killed him when he went afk
---
Then why did Blizzard GMs put them in the same category as a trusted person?
---
maybe going to an officer in the guild would've been better
---
I agree not beeing able to switch the ring out changes everything of course
---
When pushing for top ranks. In that matter 3 hours a day is casual AF. Your the only one to make sense and have a reason lol.
---
I didnt do this in classic, but when I played you needed to import data to the gatherer addon. There was one addon which tracked and calculated the optimal paths and so on and there was like a addonname_database or something like that. I would check right now for you, but twitch app is laggy now.
---
I was with you on the "this is going to far" but I noped out when you jumped straight into "this isn't a big problem for me so it must not be a big problem for you" territory.
---
That sounds super annoying lol
---
A potato computer or has the settings on low maybe?
---
Yep currently having about 5 minutes delay. Last night it was about 15 minutes at worst.
---
Nope, you are wrong.
---
People weren't PvP oriented pre-p2, and there was way less people out in the World.
---
even if flying into a tagged player grounded both of you... whoa man thatd be something else. air gank squads would be terrifying
---
According to Blizzard, Guildies are an acceptable person to trust with something such as this. Said so in their own email. 
---
If we can't trust anyone, why is the trade system so reliant on us doing so? Wouldn't it make more sense to make it so you simply can't get scammed with a new and improved trade system?
---
He didn't say premades were an issue, he commented that the sub is going to blow up with posts saying premades are the issue once BG's come out.
---
Do you have a guild or friends that you play with? I would say find a fun way to give it to them if you can, maybe like guild trivia or something
---
Funny thing is horde outnumbers alliance on my server roughly 60/40 and in every zone its nothing but the horde getting its shit kicked in by the alliance all day every day.
---
1g for a port is nutty....
---
I really want to make that one, it looks absolutely amazing on the photos, the only thing stopping me is that I don’t have much experience with making dough and pastries. I’ll definitely try it though, it’s at the top of the list!
---
Definitely different from what I've experienced then
---
How so? I was level 14 and need 1 stam and 1 int as much as literally everyone else. Hunters use mana you know. It's not like RFC is stuffed with leather gear.
---
Every raiding guild should have 1 dedicated druid ot imo
---
I'll still kill you if you're worth no honor.
---
I have been playing lock for years but I dont go the easy route. 
---
I level as a destro lock, 5/13/3 is my way to go until i max destro and put the remaining 11 points elsewhere(depending of my race) . You need to drink every 3-4 mob. Undead is my favorite race because of cannibalize, but I am all the time a human because of friends.
---
To farm and even raiding I go 30/21/0  I tend to not choose ruin, and go with demon sacrifice. +15% Shadow Dmg in raid and + 3% HP regen every 4 sec. You just run and dot everything and if it get out of hand just drain life. But the HP regen with life ap make u invincible.
---
Woah nelly, as a rogue in a Hunter / DPS Warrior world....the salt. I have lost Truestrike Shoulders and Dal Rends more times than I can count. Like WTF Blizz, why is all the best melee dps gear in the game leather. I will probably only get over this once I start getting MC gear lol.
---
I don't think water really has a standard, I usually see somewhere around 1 or 2 silver per bottle (so 3 stacks would be like 50s-1g total). Portals are generally considered to be 1g; I've sold many portals without talking to people even because it's so standard: They ask, you invite, they give you 1g, you make the portal, they go in and you leave.
---
How does it make your pvp experience worse if you aren't getting camped by 60's?
---
The thread is literally just asking about dumbasses / douchery / entitled things people do. Streamers do all of these things, regardless of whether or not you rolled on a server with one of them or not.
---
You saying 'well you knew they were there' doesn't mean the example of streamers fitting those categories aren't true, because they are still true.
---
Basically what you said has nothing to do with the thread
---
When you unsub from this horseshit, be sure to put this in the extra comments field. I would also add that dungeons is barely an option as you will get shit on repeatedly trying to get into the instance.
---
I am irrationally disappointed in how this all went down, I was looking forward to fighting people over thorium, black lotus etc. Just some dustups here and there, maybe even having to log off and try again the next day. It's been shit, even in lower zones. Drive by ganks and then corpse camping. 
---
I think they could fix it if they made anything under 3 levels lower a DK (or something reasonable). At 52 I can't even land a spell, it makes no fucking sense.
---
I'm a casual-ish player...maybe medium core. I didn't make it to 60 largely because of the timing on some work travel. When I devote around 3 hours a night to play, sometimes more, sometimes less. I spend the first 1.5-2 just corpse walking. The game's ascendancy was on the content's accessibility for the masses. This completely fails to capture the spirit of classic. 
---
This is, under no fair assessment, the classic experience. This is garbage. I know it's put a bad taste in my mouth, almost feeling punished because I didn't get to 60 in time. I'm not sure I even want to come back when bgs come out. I'm just further behind now, and I basically have to idle or log in and be pissed for a few weeks.
---
Are you high?  Of course you can do it.  Set up the trade in discord and try not to get scammed.
---
Saw your forum post has been locked. Dude, you are not getting any love today....
---
SHHHHHHHHHH don't tell them
---
Sound alike a time where I join a group for strat and get to the part where you use scarlet key. I got booted and then asked why and was told “guildie made me do it lol sorry”
---
That is called a meme build
---
You can use it, its not that much of a game changer in MC and wont significantly impact clear times. Bosses are already going down insanely fast, are you really that concerned about saving 5-15 seconds on 9 bosses?
---
No if you reset you start over at the beginning of the dungeon.
---
If dps don't want to focus fire, your best bet is to play damage control and keep melee mobs off of the clothies.  Rogues can vanish if needed, hunters can feign, and warrior dps just get free bonus rage and are almost as tanky as you are.  If someone does complain about aggro, mark skulls and tell folks if they get aggro on a non-skull it's on them to use their defenses.
---
&gt;Vast majority of the time people are just doing corpse runs to get to their dungeon, being the reason they showed up to the zone in the first place.
---
Isn't losing acess to a resource?
---
And thats when you should call in your faction, enter the world chat and say that "There is a group of scumbags camping BRM, come help us" or whatever, and solve it socially.
---
Obviously its a problem on dogshit servers with horrendous ratios, but if there is manpower thats what you should do.
---
Fighting over actual resources in the world is just much more intriguing to me than BGs where you have nothing to lose or gain, and that "objective" focus you are talking about is valued in premade-runs.
---
AV will also just be backdoor-rushes in order to get the most efficient rep/hour by either winning or losing fast.
---
&gt;You think wPvP is more fun than BGs? 
---
100%, I don't think battlegrounds are fun. Might have to do some AV just for the free epics, but besides that I probably won't touch either AB or WSG.
---
I don't even care about honor efficiency, I just want to play the way I enjoy the game, which is out in the world bitch-fighting with people over resources or areas.
---
No they don't. I was scammed out of a lot of gold for trying to buy one of the transmute recipes. Guy put the other way in the trade. I noticed it literally a second too late to cancel the trade. Even admitted it in whispers and Blizzard didn't do anything.
---
You will be, maybe wait until bgs come out? Might have a better time. Don’t want to lose you again
---
See this is how I know I’m a noob. 1g for a portal (which costs 20s in mats) seems crazy to me but I guess that’s bc 1g is basically nothing when you get higher levels.
---
The point was more “this problem wont exist in two weeks for anyone so if it’s really bothering you take a deep breath and spam dungeons for a bit.”
---
Was that in Grobbulus?  If so I have screenshots to back it up :)
---
There is no joke that’s really all they do
---
that's an easy one.
---
 If you're stuck on mythic lady ashvane  ( like hundred of guild are, by wow progress)... more loot ain't gonna do shit for you; you need proper strategy and proper execution.
---
it's also quite obvious in mythic+ : you might struggle do finish 13 and 14 in time in a full 440's group, but people are clearing 25's and higher with that gear... so obviously it's not a gear issue.
---
However, on classic, if you suck really bad... odd are you can just farm more gear / consumable and kill stuff before anything happen ( see killing rag before submerge... and using double fire protection potion, turning rag into little more than a tank-and-spank).
---
in other word, on classic nobody is impressed by your rag kill, even if they might drool over your hand of ragnaros... but on retail, it's your cutting edge achievement that people look at... not... wathever thing Azshara drop.
---
Whats the problem then? If you are alliance
---
What? Hordes are many enough to be killing pvp tagged people inside IF every morning with little to no resistance. Alliance may own BRM some hours on wednessdays because they've been reduced to raid logging for the most part.
---
I actually reported him the way he described immediately. There is no option for scamming or stealing. Just "cheating"
---
I think for me, the problem is for the last 8 years or so, my “WoW Community” has been more or less limited to my guild and the occasional pug. My guild is very close-knit (we added each other al on Facebook, have a guild meetup at Blizzcon every year, etc) so they are generally very considerate, polite, and treat each other like close friends. 
---
This mad me forget was the general online gaming population is usually like, and yeah... not a lot of crossover lol. The truth is there are still plenty of great people playing, but I still find myself shocked by the enormous amount of shitty people online, but that’s just because of the vastly increased exposure to new people due to pugs and substantially larger raid sizes.
---
I dont have access to the game right now, but it's 31/20/0, Holy down to Shock, Prot mostly for Imp RF
---
it's not punishable because it cannot be enforced therefore it isnt TOS
---
Yeah man I feel your pain.  Not quite as bad since I wasn't deliberately smacked in the face by a guildie, but I farmed up 5 arcane crystals and listed them on the AH.  I accidentally listed all 5 for the price of 1 since the shift click function does not work to split items when placing them directly from your bag to the AH.  I IMMEDIATELY canceled the auction (less than 3 seconds after posting) and it had already been bought up by a bank bot (basically someone who runs a script to get an alert anytime someone lists something for a suspiciously low price, they get a popup and just press buy and it makes the purchase). 
---
I whispered the guy and he basically told me to fuck off, "this is classic wow we are the scum of the earth, get used to it".  Well, he's right.  My bad, I got bent over for dropping focus for 3 seconds while listing items on the AH.  People will fuck you in any way they can in this game and you better believe they aren't feeling any guilt about it.
---
I'll bet someone reads this comment who actually runs that exact AH script and has convinced themselves it's morally acceptable because "yOu sHoUlD hAvE bEEn PAyinG AtTenTion."
---
I think rogues don't have many abilities in general. At least compared to mages/warlocks.
---
Classic case of small PP so he plays the horde. Pay him no heed.
---
Theres a lot of world pvp going on at the moment (and red is dead no matter the level). But there's also a lot of bored 60s starting up new toons and doing other content. Give another few weeks and check back in, once BGs are done, things should level out, but zomes like STV will always be murder.
---
&gt;The problem with getting rid of the 80/20 servers cross realm BG queues is if you get rid of them and people are still stubborn then youll see the EXACT same behavior as you're seeing now. Theyll still be open world farming and it will STILL be complete aids for the underdogs to get anywhere in the world.
---
Maybe, but the reason people are doing those raid-gank squads is because of the honor efficiency it provides in contrast to solo wpvp.
---
So when BGs are out, it will be way less efficient than having a shorter queue, so that would at least give incentive to the min-maxers.
---
&gt;Removing battle groups is NOT a valid solution.
---
I believe its the best solution, and its 100% true to vanilla. Cross-realm was only introduced in 1.12.1 or at least one of the very last patches in vanilla just before TBC, and if horde gets short queue time there is absolutely no reason what so ever for them to bother switching faction.
---
Why would they?
---
Quality 👌
---
i don’t want to start from the beginning :D 
---
i want to continue in this realm
---
But if they are bandaging they arent dealing damage.
---
As much as I hope they didn't, those bosses are super easy.  Trash pulls are the hardest part of Scholomance by far.
---
And don't forget the fact that it saves a lot of time, therefore technically reducing subscription length
---
Respec to Holy or roll a different class. Gonna be tough to raid otherwise unless a guild takes you as charity. I play Pally, it's sad but true.
---
Fair enough.
---
I think there's a pretty widespread understanding that in PUGs you secure the bag, so to speak. I think in most circumstances you're not going to get shit for doing what you did. You certainly didn't ninja anything. 
---
That said, everyone has to make their own judgements in those situations. 
---
Me personally? As a healer I'm generally not taking gear from DPS in 5-man PUGs if it's not my pre-bis. The ring scenario in particular I'd be relaxed about because one pre bis is a quest item and Rosewine is pretty easy to farm. 
---
Not saying it's super egregious to look at it differently, not saying I'd call you out. But I generally try to be consistent with my attitude towards loot /shrug.
---
Retail: My character JohnDoe mails your character JoeBloe 10,000 gold.
---
Classic: your character PlainJane is supposed to mail my character BillyBob gold.
---
Yup, sure sounds like "can't even do it" to me.
---
Never had a guild unfortunately, and it looks like the 2 friends I played with are quitting as well.  
---
I had fun in the game but it's too theme-park for my tastes.  I played a lot of Archeage and I think that game has ruined me for all other MMO's - it was just so good (well until the publisher ruined it ofc).
---
Oh yeah your job as a rogue was SO difficult lol stfu
---
I think I saw that porno
---
Well the problem is trying to MC someone faster than they die. Because here on faerlina it's impossible to cast anything longer than a instant cast. Good luck if you can actually manage to catch someone in a mind control
---
I hate it when people just open a window and don’t even ask, just expect.  I will never charge though or expect a tip.  Even outside of runs, if someone just asks.
---
Could get a small tournament going for level 35-39 to duel for it. That might be a bit involved though.
---
I understand what you're saying, but when Blizzard literally wrote in their ticket "next time try trading with a trusted person such as a guild member" it sends a very confusing message.
---
Not true at all. I've borrowed amounts for 5-6 Arcanite from guild members multiple times. The first time I borrowed 195g from a healer (this was pre Phase 2, so Arcanite Bars weren't in high demand yet and therefore only around 30-35g per), and just recently I borrowed 225g from another tank. Both times I paid them back in less than a week, it was always "X item on the AH for a stellar deal" kind of situations. 
---
But the point is it's not uncommon at all for established guild members to loan this kind of money for a purchase. And an item like Lionheart is THE type of item that would support this type of loan - it's BiS for all of Classic, so why wouldn't you jump on it if you got a nice price?
---
huge
---
in the sense that you cannot look at healing meter like you look at dps meter? yeah.
---
in the sense that people take 10 healer in MC when it's doable with 6? yes... but then again,  DPS check aren't really a thing in MC either.
---
Yea, and in the 10-15 minutes they saved you in travels you could have made 5g
---
I had a moment like this a couple weeks ago in a couple different occasions. I'm fairly pre-raid BiS geared except for a couple items. I found myself on a my couple days off just spamming the hell out of a couple of dungeons and in general, just kind of wasting my day playing WoW trying to get a couple items. At the end of those days Baron cloak never dropped, Truestrike never dropped, and Barbarous blade never dropped.
---
I started wondering why I even cared in the first place. Why do I care about min-maxing and getting the best gear I could get? This bled out into weekly raiding and worrying through the night in hope that my Giantstalker pieces would drop so i'd get a chance to roll on them or whatever. I can only raid one night a week and it takes a few hours, plus I'm like, racing home from work at 6 to make it into the raidgroup; i typically don't get to eat dinner cause it lands in that timeframe.
---
Now...why am I even bothering? Not in a nihilistic kind of way, but why is something so petty or unimportant so invested in by myself?
---
I started to realize that none of it mattered to me and that led to me realizing that none of what I was doing was really fun in particular. I'm just spamming dungeons and I'm forcing myself to squeeze content out of the game by min-maxing my way in the lategame. I already kinda do decent enough damage to be relevant on the meters, so why would i want to invest in that time for just a tiny bis upgrade?
---
This led me to the decision to just cancel my subscription and let the month bleed out.  Feels weird even going to a raid this week cause I feel like i should just pass on any loot that drops cause I'd just be taking it from somebody else that might actually want it or use it. I might just bench myself and not even bother showing up since my sub runs out on friday, We'll see though.
---
This is on Grobbulus, there are plenty of Alliance we just let it happen for some reason. A flight path getting camped? Go kill them once then leave them to camp it for another 20 minutes uncontested then repeat. Really makes leveling annoying.
---
no, you'd just be bad at both.
---
Yeah, they closed it within 5 minutes. Vrakthris said they can't do anything.
---
1) buy bags, lots of bags. Chill in a leveling zone and wait for someone to say something in general chat that only a new player would say and load him up.
---
This one's got my vote. Make it rain mageweave bags on the new guys. Relatively small amount of gold for you, but those 12 slots to get started are amazing
---
We've been having problems with Ragnaros. Any tips to get him down finally?
---
do you run out of mana often?
---
K
---
It was never this populated before, unforeseen consequences and such.
---
Yeah, 1% crit is something like 12SP~, 1%hit is something like 13SP~, 9 int is something like 1SP~.
---
Banthok has like 12 SP + 1%Hit, so it's better in PvE.
---
I'd take the Archmage belt for PvP though.
---
Wait for battlegrounds.
---
The % spell hit is what makes it very good.
---
They're listed on pre raid bis lists but fail to explain that's with 15 agi enchants currently barb blade is pre raid bis the other thing is if you're melee weaving with your shot rotation the 2her will be better. While having all this info is great it begins to reduce a players own thought process and understanding as to why it's good so it doesn't surprise me to see troll hunters running around with 12% hit clueless they should drop surefooted from their spec for improved Mark or improved hawk.
---
Wait...opposing faction actually cares if the target has that debuff? xD
---
ol?
---
I have a copy of the atlas and can confirm that it does not list any rare spawns at all. I could see it being a useful resource when the game first dropped, but now that there are multiple databases with far more details it's pretty useless.
---
. Honestly those numbers will be higher if the Zone wasn't so big. I spent so much time running as a ghost, I basically died as soon as I revived each time.
---
Sunk cost fallacy
---
Keep. I have been using it from the beginning and people laugh at my low level epic axe until they see that I am the best tank they have ever run a 5/10 man with. The difference it makes in sustained threat output and sustained mana regen is too much to pass up. People say thrash is a close second but its kinda the same way a Prius is a close second to a Tesla.....
---
I didn't say he was lying...
---
You said original commenter doesn't understand how probability works.  I'm saying you shouldn't assume that OP is telling the truth about his drops, given we know the odds are astronomically low.  Probability says it's much more likely he is lying.
---
bears with imp thorns and omen can pull 350+ dps

Did you play on Darksorrow back in the day? Familiar guild name. :)

Not claiming its the developers fault at all. I'm actually saying their response to something that is somewhat common (or atleast was) was disappointing. This person was trusted.
---
Sure, then again, let the dude roll mage and dont try to convince him otherwise...?
---
I'm just saying, if you're going to level with some pals why wouldnt you want that to be an enjoyable experience? Playing 3 pallys will undoubtedly be more difficult than running with a well rounded group and possibly make you or your friends quit. You'll be more powerful and progress smoother if you steer away from ~~your~~ OPs* admitted stupidity.
---
It's a significant hit, it's hard to put it in terms of hours since honor points vary quite a bit, but you should always avoid getting a DHK if possible.
---
Intended or not ill take it as a compliment. This sub is only good for shit posting and fake outrage anyway, it's all in good fun.
---
From what others have said, it should calculate immediately by subtracting from your current honor
---
No way it will go back. May be slightly better? But horde will be in pvp packs roaming still, waiting for queues to pop and alliance will get instant queues.
---
that's a dumber idea because it will just make people mad even more since the roaming death squads are just individual players trying to tag players before they die so they can get honor. This wont change anything aside from pissing people off even more
---
So instead of saying huge, do you actually know how mutch or just asume because you heard it somewhere?
---
Yep. High ticket rare items like Vis'kag should in my opinion be given to players that put the most effort into their character. The rogue that raidlogs shouldn't have the same chance of getting Vis'kag as the rogue who helped 6 guys in the guild get their epic mount.
---
You're the banana king!
---
I had freezing band drop on a BRD run, there were two mages in the group. Of course, we all need on it, everyone needs the gold. I won the roll as the tank but decided to let the mages roll for it.  
---
As much as I needed the gold, it didn't sit right with me not letting one of the mages use it.
---
I just finished leveling fishing this weekend.  Once you hit 250ish it’s about 8-10 fish for each point.  225-300 all in Moonglade.
---
Thanksgiving break broseph
---
That same argument could be made for real life friends and family members too. Happens literally every day to people, from all walks of life.
---
Interest ya in a pint?
---
She is lucky I've slain so many dragons in Azeroth
---
Why would anyone care what you are trying to say if you are discounting their experiences at the same time? This is a huge problem for some. Plenty have already quit. Telling them to calm down is condescending. It's a conversation ender. 
---
And BGs are the hope but we'll see how long the queues are. If Horde are eating even a 15 or 30 min queue each time you know they will set their hearths out in the zones so they can teleport right back out to ganking while waiting for the next BG. 
---
IMO what's really going to settle things down is when enough players realize how brutal the honor ladder is and just give up on Rank 10.
---
cool
---
not really. reagent costs around 20 silver and you need to find a mage in a capital city willing to do it. doesn't sound nutty to me
---
Ya I get that. Just be aware that you might not have a good time :P best of luck!
---
It is your fault though? 
---
Don’t join pugs, join a guild, or make your own raid.
---
obviously it's not 1:1
---
do it. you won't.
---
Huh that's an awesome idea - looks like I can buy about 100 of those things haha.
---
I think you're making some assumptions about the gold trading that might be taking place.
---

As a hunter I'd have to agree...Hunters have no need to roll on dal'rends. Polearm from magistrate in UD strat and Barbarous blade in DM North are just way better of choices for a hunter. Why take something so rare away from other classes that'll actually utilize it much better?
---
Is blizzard saying you can scam people?
---
I just gank people who play a different class than me.
---
Found the mage.
---
I rolled on a PvE server, and regularly join up with a group at SS to heal, buff, cleanse, BoF, BoP, stun, and bubble if I get focused.  I get honor for this, and have fun doing it.  Even though I'm not 60 yet, they are happy to have me along doing support because in the end, they get a lot more honor too, and everyone wants to kill and very few want to heal in PvP.
---
The change suggested by OP would remove my ability to get any honor at all, because I'd have to find other sub-60s that are also pvp flagged and hope 60s don't interfere.
---
Getting camped by 60s doesn't happen to me, because I knew I wouldn't be in the first (or second, or third) wave of players to hit 60, so I rolled on a PvE server to avoid exactly what is making OP's life miserable.
---
&lt;Insert Henny Youngman joke here&gt;
---
Classic loot means something because it's the obly way to be 'better' at the game, because the actual content is so easy in classic. It just means you put in the time,not that anything you did was difficult.
---
So then why aren’t all mages outputting exactly identical dps numbers? Why don’t the top parses have identical gear and numbers?
---
I'm completely prebis and half bis currently but really short on gold. Do you happen to know how long of a grind it is in AV? I played in vanilla but since alterac lasting for literal days and then no queue pops later at all I have absolutely no idea
---
I think Holy with Improve of hammer of justice is the way to go. To be able to stun someone every 35 second is amazing
---
I get ganked by alliance all the time. Alliance players need to quit acting like it doesn't go both ways and that they somehow have more integrity than a horde player. I see your bitch ass join in on a 2v1 to make it a 3v1 don't think I don't. 
---
Just spent 15 minutes death crawling my way into DM West because of a 20 man alliance gank squad controlling the entrance as well as like 2 or 3 five man groups on the roads from FP to DM. Then went to UBRS and death crawled there due to an alliance raid blocking the entrance from Badlands to Searing Gorge.

\*gasps\* the horde being shitty? who would have guessed lol
---
/spit
---

---
/rofl
---
Whirlwind only hits 4 targets, BRD you frequently have 5-7 mobs in a fight.
---
The mass raid-gank squads is NOT efficient to farm honor in. In a 40 man raid you get 1-5 honor per kill, where if you're soloing you get 200. The most efficient way to farm is get in a group of 10-15 people and roam and kill people, hopefully other 5-15 man groups. Well actually the most efficient way to farm is be a POM Pyro mage or rogue with pred and sit stealth in a capital and kill someone every 2 minutes for 200+ honor, die, and do it again. 
---
There will always be steady streams of people going from Thorium point to BRM, which means the honor will always be there. If longer queues are happening then horde will be out in front of BRM getting their honor by farming people on their way to BRM still. 
---
Cross-Realm BGs were introduced in vanilla to counter long queue times. Why take something like that out of the game? Blizzard doesn't want to punish their players. They want to make it more enjoyable for everyone.
---
Horde are not being offered faction changes and no way in hell blizzard ever implements this. So that solution is off the table completely.
---
Do you have no idea how computer science works? Where is that code ran? It's a reference to the lua function. And you can follow it up to see how it's translated into the binary code. 
---
You realize Lua is a way to interface with this code in an easy to use an extensible scripting language right?
---
You also seem very angry from your post history. But what does being a data engineer have to do with anything? I'm a systems guy and work on this level everyday. A data engineer will never touch a compiler or assembly at all.
---
I know there are alot of unskilled engineers out there. But it's sad that you really defend this, and have no idea about the fundamentals, while being so angry.
---
lua provides a way to interface with the lower level code. Thats all it is. I showed you the internals of it. Please go retake your cs degree.
---
You wouldn’t want to change man, I play on stalagg and it’s seriously so shitty being the minority
---
that's why. you'll stay flagged for 5 minutes
---
Flying was never properly implemented....they left all the mobs on the ground.
---
Hell, the most dangerous 'mob' in the air was the other faction (fuck you boomkin with a parachute! xD).
---
I play hunter i thunderfurry. Whats your name ill find you and keep ya marked 🤣
---
I used to firmly be in the boat of “need if you need, greed if you want” but I’ve come to realize that it’s just setting yourself up to lose expensive loot to people rolling need for alts or gold. Make sure you talk about loot rules before you go in, I say need everything BoE now just in case someone doesn’t know better on a super rare BOE drop and passes/greeds.
---
/Point /taunt
---
I am, I have virtually everything I need from the Raids and 5mans, epic mount, cash in the bank, PvP is way more fun than sitting at the bank and staring at my character which is basically what I was doing the week before the honor system dropped. My guild is way more active, people have stopped raid logging and are logging in daily to get into the PvP groups. Phase 2 has been a blast.
---
You are doing it wrong friend, All the Alliance on Herod  are holding down BRM at peak times.
---
Had a similar situation with a druid that was super critical, gave horrible tanking advice, and was just all around an asshole. It's just their turn to act superior in something. A lot of people act like everyone should already know their class, its absurd.
---
you need to create a "user profile", you have to add everything you want to your profile
---
It's also annoying to try and give healers a break by drinking, only to be healed right as I sit down to drink. Same thing with using bandages. I swear it's a passive aggressive thing for all healers. 
---
"Good good, you are healing yourself, now I'm gonna waste your materials by healing you."
---
That’s a good question. I see people offering 1500g to but it and 1800 gold to sell it. So how many are actually moving at those prices are questionable. But yeah.
---
For most items, if its shadow dmg or frost dmg it is very likely some fire dmg proca also get affected by it. No Nature dmg procs scale with it
---
Ouch...
---
You can, and you can even use it to buy someone else game time for classic gold. You get someone to create a retail character on your server, give them however much gold a token is going for, and they can buy game time and give you classic gold. It’s been okay’d by blizz.
---
Best thing to do, is check here the Guilds looking for players section. Those will be the active guilds as well so it will give you a better choice.
---
Which is evidenced by your completely absurd comments to the guy you are speaking to.  You are kind of a moron.
---
Cry
---
I don't believe this is fixed even today (based on other reports about is still), but it certainly wasn't fixed on 10/30 either. I got saved to an already cleared Onyxia on 10/30 just by zoning in. There wasn't even a trash mob in there to hit, let alone a boss to attack.
---
&gt;Cross-Realm BGs were introduced in vanilla to counter long queue times. Why take something like that out of the game?
---
Yes, but the servers on retail 15 years ago were also much smaller than they are now.
---
&gt;Blizzard doesn't want to punish their players. They want to make it more enjoyable for everyone.
---
How is it enjoyable to play on the faction thats 20% of the server?
---
I would just quit if I had heavily invested into such a shit server and blizz doing nothing to fix the ratio.
---
&gt;Horde are not being offered faction changes and no way in hell blizzard ever implements this.
---
Well, more alliance will most likely quit then , or switch server and make the issue even worse.
---
What would your solution be then if faction transfer is off the table? Just hope for a massive influx of alliance players while the servers are dying?
---
I mean, yeah. Irrelevant of level, the opportunity to deny someone a kill on an enemy or a quest objective is fun. It's part of the appeal of playing on a pvp server - ganking. 
---
I don't understand why people are so upset. Did you *not* gank people prior to this honor patch? Why not? It's a lot of fun.
---
even more dumb then if that's on herod. 5 mins from the time of the video and there was 10+ more horde there to contest
---
There's nothing wrong with "scraps". They're still great items, and it's not like MC loot is this exotic resource.
---
If you like the people in the guild, stick it out. You'll get items naturally and eventually you'll catch up in DKP and be competitive for the shiny stuff.
---
I needed 'mask of the unforgiven' from a hunter as a resto druid for my OS. I asked beforehand and they were like "it's my bis but go ahead and roll" and I should've just passed. I saw a huge tanking upgrade and now I rarely tank and still feel like a total asshat. I think back to that everytime I think I 'need' something.
---
First mad respect for playing a tank, its not easy especially running pugs. I may suggest your first time running a new instance trying running it as a dps. It's a good way to get a feel for an instance with little to no pressure. 
---
That said, don't ever feel bad trying to get everyone on the same page. I was a tank through MC/BWL and AQ back in vanilla and am one again, and constantly play dumb with groups just to make sure everyone knows whats going on. 
---
Remember,  
---
"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast"
---
I'm in a amazing guild for a month now but yeah at first lol I still did times remember to swing in and drop a comment in hopes it might help.
---
That's not even remotely similar situation. I'll stick to as close to your analogy as possible while making it more applicable to the situation. 
---
What if you gave them $100 to watch your dog, and they decided to take your dog and move without telling you anything? If you had records of the agreement, then you absolutely could press charges against that person and have your dog returned to you. He's supplied records here, and was told "Sorry, we found your dog but you can't have it back".
---
Well can confirm this is true
---

Shop around for a more casual guild that would be willing to bring a ret paladin. There are more casual raiding guilds that will slot and gear less favorable specs. Realistically, you will probably have a hard time finding such a guild, and your best bet is to re-spec to a holy paladin or focus on PvP.
---
So remove the words “you won’t believe it” 
---
Is that click bait?
---
You're like a brick wall
---
I believe this.  You are already completely full of moronic comments, it's probably hard to fit anymore in your little head.
---
I do agree with that. Vanilla is overall a better experience. 
---
But the point in the OP I’m arguing against is that the best vanilla players are not as skilled by virtue of the fact that aspects of the game are simpler (which goes both ways) does not mean that the best players in Vanilla would perform worse than their peers in retail. It’s a joke playing off the fact that one aspect of the game is simpler implying that you could coast to the top of the meters without skill (probably true in some guilds but you don’t coast your way to accidentally parsing 99) but there’s no accurate commentary in it.
---
Maybe if you're one person joining a random group that's what PvP looks like.
---
PvP for us is mostly chasing the alliance pre-mades from zone to zone. They hit EPL/WPL terrorize the solo players until horde shows up and wipes them out then they leave, usually to Feralas.
---
Planing ahead. Farm those small flame sacs now so sell the poor man's fire protection potion.
---
Thank you for the correction.
---
There's no benefit to everyone attacking at the same time before the honor buff wears off, you get nothing for the kill.  Sure it happens sometimes where everyone gets trigger happy, but a large group of people aren't going to sit and camp the flight paths nonstop for zero honor gain.  If you're waiting for the honor buff to wear off so you actually get something, the MCing priest will snipe the kill credit for their duel partner every time.
---
I got it in a single AV battle. It also lasted about 6 hours tho.
---
After so many deaths I feel like I could walk back to my body from graveyard with closed eyes.

I live in Europe and work swingshift. I'm looking for a guild that has raids that start around 3 pm server time. So far, I haven't had any luck. Any guilds exist with raidtimes like this?

Do you have something to add other than a bizarre personal slight?
---
big facts
---
On Mograine I couldn't even sell runs for 5g. Everyone just seems to go for Tarnished Elven Ring.
---
Sorry writing from mobile at work. We do raid 1 Wednesday 8pm. Done by 10pm. Raid 2 I believe was Saturdays 8pm for a bit but now I think it's Thursdays? I'm a bit unsure on the 2nd times right now sorry, can check when I'm home

Is there any way to estimate the respawn timer of the world bosses? every day I run to each of their locations and they are always dead/MIA. I would like to try these fights as they seem really fun!
---
You read the trade and confirmed it. If blizzard would allow someone to read a trade, accept it, and then later claim it was a mistake and have them undo the transaction, that would open up a can of worms for everyone.
---
Imagine a world where you sell a recipe to someone for 100g. They accept, learn the recipe and start using it. Then you contact Blizzard and say "Oh man, I was scammed, I thought I was getting 1000g!" What should Blizzard do? Remove the learned recipe from that crafter? Remove the items they crafted from the economy? Take away your 100g that you might have already spent?
---
The final battle from that machinima tho!

My god i couldnt even imagine... Gl my dude

We got both bindings in back to back runs these last two weeks, pretty crazy.

No. Just read about it on wiki. Not the same, Cryptokitties is litterally a crtpto currency. Doesn't compare to a one time use code for ingame pets. Those kitties retain value and can be onsold.

He will get 100 gold by selling portals/water even before you finish your mount quests :-P
---
thats a very short-sighted view. Do you think these millions of classic players will be here in 10 months? very questionable. If they actually waned long term success they would converge the communities.
---
Woulda been epic if you put the skin tent in the background
---
Uh I trade enchanting mats all the time with complete strangers cause it won't cost me that much if they f me.  There are few items in game that both have super rare recipes and expensive mats, Lionheart being chief among them.  For these things the expectation should be they will try to scam you.  
---
Inspect other warriors who have the helm and see who made it, ask them about their experience.  Sometimes a big guild on your server with several successful crafts may be better than that one guy youve known for two weeks in your guild with near zero crafts.  
---
Ask for monetary collateral for the items you are trading that they can agree to because the items would be worth slightly more than what they pay you.  Then trade it back with the helm trade.  
---
Saying "literally never trade anything at all unless you know the person irl" has no bearing whatsoever because outside of lionheart helm there isn't even anything with that rare of a recipe that would force you to not be picky with who you deal with.
---
Hey Entropic - it’s Lilradagast. Looks like all the Runecloth finally paid off! Congrats

No that's the repairbot right beside him I'm talking about just before you exit his room after killing him there's a book on the table there I've been told it's to swap engi to goblin/gnomish.

If you are on a reasonably populated server they are going to be scouted very regularly by organized groups and killed within an hour or two of spawning. Their respawn timers are several days long.
---
I don’t ask outside of runs, but if I’m healing you, please give me water... it will make our runs faster if I’m not being stingy with drinks between pulls.  And it’s free for you while we wait for people to show up.
---
&gt; they are working on getting shadowlands ready too by the fall or earlier.
---
They already stated there's a whole separate team that works on Classic, so the development of one won't affect another. Though they might strategically release content between the two.
---
Thanks for the great answer.  I see people hunting for herbs and mining/iron/copper stuff all the time. I just don't want a profession where I log in, think "let's make some money" and then see tons of other players swarming the herbs and the mines. 
---
As for enchanting, you're right that spamming chat isn't appealing… but what about disenchanting high level greens and selling them on the auction house? Any money in that?
---
Look at your ranking bar progress on your honor page.  It should have immediately lowered.  The impact is already figured in.
---
&gt;all guilds I have been in
---
There's a reason you've been in multiple guilds and they don't seem to stick brother. Saying 'No you can't have your BiS ever' is the stupidest shit ever.
---
Come to Grobbulus if you want a real fight. It switches back and forth constantly. Who controls it usually depends on the day or sometimes the hour.
---
Did Blizzard mess with the respawn timer of rich thorium veins in Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring? I feel like 2 weeks ago I could get 4 nodes perlap now I am lucky to get 1...?
---
I play a mage. A (minor; a good mage has tools and cooldowns to use) problem with playing mages today is everyone is expecting big D aoe dps in dungeons, even with just a single mage and rest single target dps.
---
We've all been in those groups - great tank that holds aggro well on multiple high threat targets, 1 super big D or 2 above average mages aoeing everything down. Healer can almost afk and there's that +1 hunter that doesn't seem to be doing a lot, but is dropping traps, managing the pet well, and is right up there in dps. Feels great. But there's those groups when you have a tank that's not generating enough threat for whatever reason, healer is fine but burning through a bit too much mana to keep the group up, you have a rogue doing his best and a mediocre hunter and you're the only mage, and the tank pulls a group in strat UD with 2 casters, 6-8 elite melee, and a pat gargoyle comes by and fears the tank. So you as the mage tries to save the group, blow the big aoes, freeze, cold snap, mana crystal and pots, re-aoe and freeze, then ice block and hope for the best because now there's 5 mobs on your clothy ass each still somehow with 1000hp. And then that hunter tells you that you're pulling too much aggro.
---
This film was so intense and scary, the second one not so good.
---
Even if it's 100:1 it's insanely stupid.
---
Gear your dps and content gets easier quicker.
---
its just funny that horde players tend to be the loudest chest thumpers about pvp or pulling the "its WARcraft" shtick, but unless the horde outnumbers alliance by a stupid margin, or is double the alliance level's, they just get clapped all day.
---
personally, i'd try and track him down and see if he's in a new guild on the new server and let his GM know about it, at least. fuck that guy.
---
Aaand who said he had any of those? Not everyone is following the uberleet cutting edge 360 no scope prebis guide. Y'all need to grow up. You're not entitled to loot just because it's better for you.
---
It absolutely is.  Blizzards responsibility is to enforce their TOS and appropriately police their environment.  There is no universe in which this isn't Blizzards fault.
---
&gt; Anyone else have a moment like this
---
I've never really gotten like this with gear. Generally, I know which pieces of gear are good for each classes, and if it's legit BiS for someone but not BiS for me, I won't roll against them. That ring isn't really BiS for anyone, but it is kind of a neat item. So whoever has mana can roll on it.
---
Thanks for the help, the Darnassus rep was definitely a group effort!
---
And I just recently discovered that you can jump out of the window because in vanilla someone told me the entrance to MC is to jump out of the window and I just died an lava ( no prequest and no raid group didn't even know about prequest). I until lately thought that the jumping out of the window thing was a joke
---
When did the gates automatically open? I thought that was in wotlk or something. Wasn’t there like blood elves that got scarab lord on some super low pop realms?
---
If my friends had wanted to go alliance I was for sure ready to roll prot paladin. Sure raiding I'd be shit outta luck, but it's just so fun.
---
They say 42 is half way to 60. So starting over wouldnt be terrible.
---
If you're on the small side of an unbalanced server you're going to have an awful time. If you're on the dominating side it shouldn't be bad at all. If you're on a relatively balanced server you'll be fine with patience.
---
Wait how do you do that? If there are 50 hordes and 10 alliance, how do you balance it? One 10 vs 10 layer and then 4 without ally?
---
Profits on crafting professions should tend to 0 over time; except for when a new pattern comes out; in which case it's moneymaking time for those who have the pattern until they also saturate the market. Only on the rarest patterns can the price stay moderately high, because of low supply. 
---
In general I would go for any professions that you need to craft a bis BOP (for example, as a mage I would go tailoring for robe of the archmage) and aside from that just gathering professions, unless you want to get into the game of getting rare crafting patterns or handle the ever-shifting market in search of margins. If you want to invest into PvP, I would eventually drop a gathering profession for engineering when gold isn't much of a problem for you.
---
Yup! You have to spec 11 Holy for it.
---
Lmao I was on my 45 Warrior last night trying to quest in searing gorge, literally any horde that saw me would instantly attack me. Tried to get the flight path there the past 3 days, each time I get to a dead flight master, die, and see the ghosts of 20+ other alliance wishing they could even spirit rez
---
How could you possibly know what he was already using?
---
It's not about the total gold, it's about the fact that he had to BUY a mount because he's not one with the light
---
Pound a nail through your dick into a block of wood then login to wow and give all your stuff to the first person you see.

Yes but it's like an 11 point holy talent. You make a beeline for it then go all in on protection talents

Dudes not taking advantage of anyone...  just a buddy helping a buddy out, who cares about the rest?  I think this whole mentality of people having preconceived notions about what this game must be and how to maximize every possible aspect sucks.  And I think the people perpetuating it make this sub shit.
---
These posts are just as bad, no one cares about either side of the coin here and your rant is just as pointless and people's complaints
---
It doesn't matter what kind of advice you have if you insult people while trying to deliver it.
---
Because we're there for the fun PvP, not to sit around for hours wasting our own playtime just to keep Horde out of the area. We have lives and jobs - and other content in game to do ourselves. We PvP for fun, not to control an area for hours on end. Do what the rest of us do and grab a group/raid of other fellow Alliance to get you into the mountain if need be. For most this just means finding a good guild.
---
Sell yourself as a healer for arena runs.   It’s mostly rogues, warriors, and hunters that need arena/anger so you could probably get 3-6g per run. Could also request all unneeded blues/greens for vendor. It’s hard to find healers for arena runs so you could definitely work out a deal.

&gt;Do people just gloss over the part where this was a guildie?  
---
What does that have to do with being a stranger?
---
You now have to RP a dishonorable character and either undertake a long quest at redemption, or embrace your lack of honor and be a prick to everyone.
---
So you dont like classic wow? Why are you playing?
---
You can play the game outside of dungeons if you are in a proper guild just fine
---
Yup at 100:1 I'd straight up have like 20k gold in classic, and I haven't played retail since cataclysm. It would royally fuck up the economy.

Dragon breath chili and oil of immolation on the warrior should keep aggro all on them

Talk about clickbait, right? Guy makes well over $300k a year using that “dumb clickbait shit”.
---
So now tell the guy who posted this video that his title has too many emojis and tell him to stop.

Now, if you could create a channel, with no buzz words, no clickbait, not emojis, titles as boring as a news network “225 dead on flight U7278” and be successful, shit I’d give you props.

What this title is, is nothing close to clickbait. What it does is gets your attention as your scroll down the screen.

There is a warlock on my server infamous between healers for constantly killing himself by lifetapping and spamming hellfire then raging at the healers and leaving the group.
---
You are making some big assumptions
---
&gt;Because the guildie is probably under the assumption that he's helping a guild memeber craft the BiS vanilla helm and will help the guild as a whole...
---
The guildie fully understands the purpose of my request, I even offered to tip but they refused and are happy to do it for free
---
&gt; No loot system guarantees drops I guess.
---
Ain't that the truth. We went three weeks in a row with one fire damage gloves off Domo (useless for MC) being the only caster drop.
---
I know melee can hit her in the air.. what I don’t know is how a fireballed tank who has 0 aggro is going to beat a warlock in p3 transition.

Not apples to apples. Blizzard is hands off when it comes to loot distribution and trades between players. They’ve said this multiple times.
---
Most scouting is done by lvl 1 or lvl 20 warlock alts camped at the spots they spawn.
---
GM response to this is extremely disappointing. Get your shit together Blizzard, jesus christ.
---
This seems like a good idea but I also play a caster so I’m not sure unsheathing my weapon will be too threatening lol. Usually in this situation they just turn around and go the other way
---
Basically yes, as the system was also present in vanilla, but the present mega servers (no changes... yeah sure) make it just better noticeable.

Nope, but if they’re in the instance already the summon will work. They can’t be outside of the instance and receive a summon inside to MC. 
---
It’s useful if a douse is forgotten, someone falls in lava, someone rolls up late to raid because of the queue boss.
---
From how I understand the honor exploit (it's basically an exploit) works is one person kills everyone in the enemy raid by themselves, no party, then the next person goes, etc while trading for the other faction doing the same. There are usually a couple healers on Rez duty. This method means each person will get full honor from each kill, for way way more honor total than just like a 40 man killing a 40 man. It takes longer, but it would be super hard to compete with the honor per hour.
---
im very excited for the future
---
Crit =/= hit
---
I’m aware.
---
I think the strafing might be what I’m missing here. Maybe the most universal sign of /ready
---
I can't say much about how well Ele performs in PvP. As for Enh, I never had much problems. Engineering gives some fine stuns and mobility tools to your kit. Also some melee weapons do have a really nice weapon procc, like an insanely long bleeding effect, or a several seconds long stun.
---
Instantly purging a mages/priests bubble and then immediately landing a windfury strike, almost one-shotting them, never gets old.
---
Hit is way better than crit, they're not that close. Closer to 10–12 vs. 15 Agree with Archmage for PvP though, especially as hit is useless in PvP as long as you've got at least 2/3 in EP.
---
How old are you?
---
It was P1... getting 60 and rolling through phases in time. Then blizzard rushed the shit out of these phases and now I just feel demotivated.
---
I got super lucky. Took me about 7 runs to get Hand of Justice, sincerely level 57 rogue.
---
Then they shouldn’t advertise jed.
---
This is a game changer. I had seen that but thought it was incompatible with classic since it is marked as game version 8.2.x. I see the classic link, Thank you!

have fun in AV guys!
---
Instead of selling the helm, you should sell an LHH 'package' with all the mats. Then refer them to your guildie to have it crafted, and your guildie can charge for the actual crafting.
---
This way you both profit.

Why not hunter?

Gathermate 2, starts with no data but you can import data sets.

Grats my guy
---
&gt;You do know what the definition of stranger is right? It doesn't seem that you do.   
---
It seems it is you that doesnt understand.  Just because someone isnt a stranger to one person does not mean the person isnt a stranger to you.   
---
Likewise just because this person was a well-known guildy doesnt mean that he wasnt a stranger to OP.   
---
&gt;A well known guildie present in guild runs and raids and activities with multiple groups and multiple people is not a 'stranger'.  
---
Perhaps not to some of the guild.  But to OP he was a stranger.   
---
&gt;Despite how hard you're trying to make it seem like he is.

Except he is.

Isn’t that what a lot of multiboxers do?
---
I said every class has a good way of farming gold - not that every class has a good way solo. Warriors can duo jump runs. That's a good way for shaman and paladins as well. Hunters have dm, mages have zf/lashers, priests have lashers, rogues have brd, locks have dm or maraudon, etc. It's not that hard, it just requires a bit of dedication.
---
Minutes no, murders yes
---

---
Another pve carebear post.
---
Oh come on, zombies aren't quite as braindead as most horde, that's a little unfair
---
Ironic
---
Well kinda, not entirely. I ran out of stuff to do and I play alone anyway. So this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I still like wow and will be back next expansion... I just don't wanna sit around and subject myself to jerks on a video game. It';s all good.
---
Yeah, that's probably all true. 
---
It's been so many years I don't remember having to ride in Outland, so not sure what I did to get a flying mount.
---
Did you personally know this guy or what he just a guildie that everyone else seemed to know?
---
First thing on my mind, everyone chip in 10-20g and you'll easily have the 700g together. Gives the guild more of a community feeling and really, what is 10g?
---
I mean, just because you found one guild running around doesn’t make it any less true
---
How much will it cost total for a rank 11 pvp mount and lv. 60 riding skill? Is this cheaper than buying a regular mount and riding skill?
---
It's for sure not for everybody, and that's ok. I played on PvP back during BC and WotLK because that's where my friends were, so I think part of my love for it is nostalgia based. However I never experienced gratuitous corpse camping or ganking. Maybe I just got lucky. As long as you find a way to enjoy it, that's great.
---
You have to wait for a bunch of ‘immunes’ to build up. It takes practice and its still rng whether you get smacked or not. Just keep tryin
---
So you're okay with hunters marking you before they even show up in game? As a rogue, you're kidding yourself if this doesn't piss you off. 
---
The complain about Spy started with 'one guy', this isn't any different, as I know of others who have complained about the range of hunters mark EVEN IN VANILLA.
---
Just take collateral when handing over the mats and return the collateral + tip when the item is made
---
Onyxia’s Lair
---
he mentioned in another post that he has the carapace spine xbow. which is better than strikers mark for hunters.
---
That might actually be a reportable offense if you’re getting them raid locked on purpose.., hard to prove though.
---
What class are you? Certain classes can do dungeon herb/mining runs. I do stealth solo dm east herb runs as a druid and it's super chill.
---
Yes, that is the entire point.
---
Deep prot is what you should be using unless you're with dps pulling 800+ and you've done everything you can gear and rotationally wise, and in that case you should be fury/prot.
---
Impale prot gives very, very little threat bonus for the points. It's not worth it.
---
It's also close to epic mount time. I haven't trained certain skills since low 50s. I've been farming non stop. On PvP server, and as a miner, having an epic mount is really a big deal. I didn't want to break the bank too much. So this was like.. the BEST of both worlds. Now its the worst of both.
---
I'm assuming everyone who doesn't have to work due to crippling depression/other personality disorders rolled horde, hence the 24/7 camping of nearly all flightpaths
---
I can see why you're complaining, but I landed at LHC same day just later and I got insta killed, was on my with to Live, got killed 3 times on my way there by a 10+ people deathball... 
---
Inb4 people are like "Skeram is 10:90", Yup I know but it's just a matter of wrong place wrong time.
---
i wish they just displayed the reroll then... we'd be able to see super rare events like 3 rerolls in a row, which may have happened each time these are posted
---
You have to stack ‘Immune’s and leave block at the right time
---
What does that mean?
---
These posts are way cringier.
---
Best I advice I can give is to poke around https://wago.io/classic-weakauras and check out some auras. Import them and then open them up to see how they work, learn from there.
---
Hunters have always been able to mark 100 yards away.  I have vanish and prep.
---
&gt; I know of others who have complained about the range of hunters mark EVEN IN VANILLA.
---
So?  Lots of people complained about lots of things in Vanilla.  That doesn't mean they should all be changed on a whim.

Same goes for all the "Alpha-" beasts in the game. Like c'mon now are you really an alpha if there's like 30 of you?
---
I'm just struggling to find these mages reddit jerks off over. No issues getting water or ports, or with them only spamming arcane explosion in dungeons, idk dawg. I'm starting to think it's just mage envy :)
---
&gt;It isn’t, and it doesn’t have to be.
---
Exactly, they could fix it. Make this kind of stuff unable to happen. 
---
&gt;The classic community doesn’t utilize collateral well and most players navigate the free market very poorly, and then we get stuck in shitty situations like OP’s.
---
Ah yes, collateral. Might make sense if it wasn't so difficult to acquire said collateral. This is classic we're talking about, not retail where thousands upon thousands of gold are thrown at you. It takes people weeks to farm 800g+ just to get the lionheart recipe, you're expecting them to farm weeks more just to get the collateral to craft it? What an absolutely stupid statement brother. 
---
The trading system needs to be fixed, we don't need to be bandaiding against getting scammed by having hundreds upon hundreds of gold just sitting there being used for that sole purpose alone. 
---
&gt;If you’re dealing with a huge transaction (lionheart helm), collateral is the only way to mitigate your risks over the Internet. Smaller transactions such as transmutes or whatever aren’t a huge deal and usually trust is enough.
---
I want you to message some of the top crafters on your server and ask them if they'll do this. If they even have the money required to do so just sitting around. I can guarantee you at this point of the game, people are still widely using money to purchase all sorts of things.. which doesn't leave them alot left to spare. Especially with the difficulty of farming right now, and the exorbitant price on some items.
---
Username doesn't check out.
---
Put a banana in your ear
---
That’s fair. Definitely felt weird to be made to feel like I’d broken some cardinal rule by rolling for an upgrade though. 
---
I always try and make a judgement call on rolling for something that’s an upgrade for me depending on, you know, my need vs whoever else is rolling. But using “is this item clearly defined on the accepted pre-bis list of another class” as the sole indicator for who should get something seems a bit over-the-top-serious for the situation. 
---
I haven’t played on private servers, but am I right to assume that’s where the mindset / rules / expectation comes from?
---
Yea by and large we try to have a good attitude about things and reward those who help the guild and encourage those who don’t to begin doing so. It’s all just a game and working together will yield better results. Sure it sucks losing something you wanted but if it goes to someone who helps the guild, it’s really not so bad.
---
Absolutely, no reason to afk for 5+ minutes in the middle of a dungeon, especially when you're close a to a boss.
---
I'm legitimately curious as to why the vast majority of rejects that play the game this way rolled horde, like across multiple servers... It just seems odd to me that there's a cult of personality on horde and alliance seems to be filled with people with normal brain function

Never losing to mages, have lost our two top rogues every now and then. Plan on going fury in later phases but being a slave to the meta to save 10 seconds on 9 bosses is hillarious. I pity the meta slave warrior that pvps wasting 100g/week to make unnoticeable improvements in raid. Any dps lost on the bosses is more than accounted for on trash which takes more time than the bosses. Havent found a fury warrior that can out damage me in 5 mans.
---
Fury prot is for 40 mans mainly. Its does lots of damage and generates lots of threat but its hard on healers. Maybe when Nax comes out it'll be something to go for but right now it's not superb. You also have to be geared out and know the ins and outs of how your abilites work and chain together, when to use consumables, when to pop cooldowns. If you're new to tanking your safest bet is to go impale prot or deep prot.
---
Alliance rogue.  Horde are swarming everywhere.  I want to solo pvp for honor but where is the best spot?  Currently dagger sealeed fate build with perds blade so good at picking off weak targets.

Needing on boes is common, but if you wait until everyone rolls greed and then hit need, you're a scumbag
---
&gt; I've tried twice having people summon me while I'm in an instance and then quickly hearthing to IF
---
Try doing it while you’re in a position where the summon would typically work- you can never summon people from outside of an instance in to the instance. Stepping out of the instance would get around that.
---
Druid is a smoother solo leveling experience. Cat form talent and travel form mean you have half a mount at level 21 and 2/3 at 30. Both can tank 5-mans just fine. Druids are better end game tanks (but still worse than warriors) and paladins are generally better end game healers. I leveled a druid and also wanna try out a pally, but even in the beginning it feels real slow.
---
not all problems need solving. loot drama sucks but drama isn’t bad for the game
---
I’m a raid healer that also assists on tanks should they start getting uncomfortably low. 
---
Me running out of mana though doesn’t necessarily cause people to die. Just impacts that fat healing meter.
---
It’s not an equivalence so much as an override limit.  You want to maintain a certain amount of plus healing, beyond that number, go hard on the mp5.

I can't  see how this is connected to my comment  but I agree.  What I was pointing  out is that Blizzard  should listen to the fanbase, but also to streamers who are in fact the people  who play the game the  most. They should be taken into consideration when making vital decisions. 
---
I think  the only way for Blizzard  to save  Wow in general  is to adapt and change classic and keep it moving  in a such a pace so that people  can truly  understand  and embrace it. I know it's an old and outdated  system that we all wanted but we must  accept  that it is flawed and can be improved  by little tweeks. And if that means asking Asmon what he thinks  the game needs and even partially listening to him than so be it.
---
We must do it for the greater  good that is preserving Wow and making it great again.
---
Ever since CS got outsourced, the customer service at Blizzard has gone into the toilet. I am sorry this happened to you and I am sure it is only more frustrating when other GMs have punished scammers and returned items lost in these sorts of situations. The quixotic responses from GM staff only further the argument that Blizzards care not about the subscriber base, Classic is just a nostalgia cow to be milked until it is dry.
---
It would be nice if we stopped with this shit. Yes a guy leaving over that is a complete tool but classic items will often last you 10+ levels. Dungeon drops easily beat quest rewards which are often really bad.
---
Blizzard have no idea what they're doing so probably not.
---
Mainly in reference to raid bosses. Dungeons are fine, pvp is fine. Just trying to last from beginning to end on a raid boss and have top heals while doing so.
---
But you didnt know him at all huh?  oof.
---
itll help at least sometimes. when a little gnome /smiles my view changes from them being a little pest to a little cutie and makes it harder to kill
---
What a fucking rotten attitude. 
---
It's not the "Developer's fault" but they are the arbiters in this situation and it costs them very little to restore these items - they are virtual items. There is no reason why they wouldn't, unless they want this issue to keep happening. Which they don't, they've been dealing with it for a pretty long time, they now just cut corners because they didn't believe in classic.
---
And this isn't life for it to be a "life experience", this is a game, where people go to escape the shitty parts of life. We can make whatever we want out of a game, it's a world we have perfect control over.
---
Idk if you're a scammer and this is how you justify your actions, that it's a lesson people have to learn, or if you actually believe what you're saying, but sheesh, victim blaming in 2019 is really some yikes stuff.
---
Id nominate LFR lei shen as undoubtedly harder than Ragnaros, and probably Kil’Jaeden in TOS as well
---
For sure, the guy is a real piece of work. Glad I don't have to play with him any more.
---
shout out to all the alliance players completing MC and Ony with no world buffs lol
---
Any idea what that +healing value is? I get mixed results when I google it.
---
Yeah it sucks that it isn't solo, but that's the nature of the class. They still have a very good way to farm with only one other person and in a way that many other classes can't do duo.
---
Interesting. I’ll take it with a grain of salt, however it’s nice to see a concrete number, even if it is arguably arbitrary.
---
Mp5 isn’t as valuable to priests as other classes. We have great mana regen and most fights don’t last long enough for it to come into play. In general you’re going to be better off taking healing power and being more careful with what rank spells you use and recognizing which fights you’ll need to use extra consumables/ let the rogues die.
---
Edit: I usually run with 1mp5 = 4 healing power but healing power scales better
---
You're going to get ass fisted by lazy 60's.
---
i have rank1 MotW and rejuv for this reason on my bars lol.
---
u can use limited invulnerability potions. timing the hyena AAs can be inconsistent sometimes fr
---
If you're using mana pots and runes on every fight then you already have mana problems. Most fights shouldn't need one let alone both. There's some I'd recommend making sure you're healing properly first, since that can extend your mana by quite a bit. Then, I'm wondering how much +healing you have. Once you reach a certain point you can afford to get more MP5 if you want but definitely prioritize +healing, because it allows you to be more efficient via downranking and only having to use big heals occasionally. But I haven't gotten to a point yet where I've had to decide between two pieces of gear because most usually have both. There are a few pieces that have a ton of MP5 but no healing, but for those I'd just keep them in your bags and switch to them when you need them.

Weak auras in general works on a concept of triggers that trigger displays. You can easily import pre-made ones from the link that another poster mentioned, but be careful of importing custom Lua without knowing what it is. In general only import highly rated ones with comments if you can't inspect it yourself.
---
There's lots of guides on it, for warlock one you might want is to pop up a symbol on your screen when nightfall procs. In this case, the trigger is a self-casted "buff".  Click create, pick your icon (I usually use just a regular icon), drag it where you want it and then make the trigger on buff, self casted, nightfall. This is about the simplest one you can have, but many useful ones are this simple. When nightfall procs, the symbol will show where you set it until the buff is gone.

Fuck you, our guild hasn't even had that much caster loot drop total in the last month.

You do not require high threat gear until aq. Right now you can do both but threat gear is hard to come by and puts stress on healers. I'd run deep prot until post t2
---
Not sure why my link doesnt have "requires".. thanks
---
This is v cool. Well done Grob peeps
---
Every class would be able to make a cheesy 1 shot macro, id reckon.
---
Doesn't matter..I like pvping.
---
It's grid, bartender and trinketmenu
---
Human
---
Nelf most likely.
---
Id turn into a cat and sleep all day.
---
Only 60 gold left, how much did you spend
---
The Chinese don't appreciate being called bots.
---
It's not hacking... it's just slave labor. They're gold farmers. The gold farmers seem to have common places they go and grind mobs, and yeah it's funny bumping into one but my goodness they are so boring to mess with after a minute.
---
Damn unpermed water. WTS LEGIT .08 PERM WATER! POOF PROOF!
---
Is he punching you in the face?
---
Thank you! I have a clearer understanding now. I wanted an alert when I get Clearcasting. I’ll look into other options as well.
---
How do I focus on PvP without gear from a raid?
---
It's actually tanks &gt; damage &gt; healers.  Pretty much any item that is useful for both casters and healers benefits the raid moreso on a caster than a healer.
---
That's a race and class combo.  NE can't turn into cats.
---
Healcomms is inside the Healbot addon. Its in their lib folder.
---
I still use healbot in Classic and back in Vanilla 15 years ago too on my paladin.
---
Blizz execs never really believed in classic so they put no effort into it.
---
yea, because there's no reason not to tank in lower level dungeons as you dont need to be prot
---
&gt; When battlegrounds will be introduced on December 10, the majority faction will have hour-long queues to get into WSG or Alterac Valley. 
---
Probably not due to BGs launching as cross-realm. 
---
&gt; I am also for no changes. However, login queues would not change the game itself, 
---
It would, though, for the people forced into an artificial queue. There were no faction queues in Vanilla, hence, introducing them would be against the spirit and the letter of #nochanges. Which is fine, if you believe it is necessary or would improve the game, but you can't claim to be in favor of no changes while supporting a pretty significant change. 
---
I see the appeal of faction-queues for people in the minority. But Blizzard will never implement it because that would be Blizzard actively hampering the playing experience of a huge number of players. From a practical view, even the people having a rough time with PvP right now are able to play the game, even if it's a diminished experience. While anyone forced into a faction queue wouldn't even be able to play. 
---
Hopefully, the early release of BGs will take some of the pressure off. We asked for Classic, warts and all, and the truth is the PvP design and systems in Classic are absolute garbage. The factions are aggressively imbalanced, the Honor system is probably the most poorly designed PvP reward structure I've ever seen, and the huge variation in leveling speeds between players means there is a large population on every server that provides Honor but are realistically unable to defend themselves against dedicated, geared PvPers even 1v1, much less when a group descends upon you.
---
The Honor system is whack and encourages constant, bloodthirsty PvP against as many weak targets as possible. Horde racials attract the min-max PvP players to that faction, creating an imbalance across most realms. It's a perfect storm of poor design choices by Blizzard that created the situation today, magnified by the massive populations on Classic compared to Vanilla. 
---
The only practical solution I can see long term is to change the Honor system, buff Alliance racial, or both, but that's a drastic departure from #nochanges and would essentially start Classic +. 
---
Or maybe BGs will draw off enough PvP venom to make questing possible again for the minority faction. We'll know pretty soon.
---
k well they’re 1g on my server, and the mats are pretty cheap, get ur alch friend to make u some...
---
my mage has skinning and most hyenas give 2 rugged leathers and there’s about 25-30 in the room, the boss which drops greens and blues ranging from 1-6g, and then the plant pulls. spend money to make money... 
---
if ur not getting the block technique down then ur wasting time and gold on repair bills. just trying to help=)
---
If you aren’t heavily pvping to get a high ranking, don’t let it bother you. I don’t know the exact number but after my multiple month long pvp grind back in the day i went from rank 13 to 7 in a matter of 30 minutes killing civilians because i just didn’t care. If you have aspirations of getting to a higher rank, I recommend not grouping with randoms and stick with a few people you trust
---
Tauren
---
He can use that gold to buy BiS gear for himself, which helps the guild. Buy consumables for raids so he can dps/heal/tank or whatever, better, which helps the guild. Its assummed that hes using the gold to better himself in some way.
---
Chances are he was there helping kill the boss that dropped the recipe. So how is paying to use the thing he helped obtain fair to him?
---
It was a 5m group.  I've had plenty of positive PVP experiences in 5m groups in EPL,WPL,Feralas etc.  We often face against similarly sized groups in these zones.
---
All those bananas are having a negative impact on your latency
---
It would be more beneficial for trash IMO.
---
too much responsibility for some people that's ok
---
Not sure how you could screw this up. During the many weeks I was accumulating mats for Lionheart, I would inspect every single person with the helm and note who crafted it. This way I could shop around for the lowest crafting fee. It turns out there are only two people on my server who can craft the helm - and their names obviously popped up on every single helm.
---
This operates as sort of a pre-established rapport. A huge flag was also the fact that this guy went to you offering to craft it. That should have sent alarm bells ringing. Also, you didn't ask him or others if he had crafted it for anyone else?
---
Do more research / due diligence next time.
---
Is PvP gear available yet?
---
You will get suspended but the person you scammed will not get anything back.
---
Really depends if one of your guildies brings up the idea. Depends on the person, tbh. Wouldn't be too crazy if you actually brought it up to your GM though. I understand if your guildies aren't too excited to chip in 10gold to your cause, but your GM \*should\* understand you got scammed by a guildie. I feel like every GM should be understanding of that situation. After all, it's his guild.     
---
Just shoot him a message on Discord or smth, link him this thread and ask if there's something that can be done from the guild's perspective. If he tells you you're out of luck, then I guess that's all. Unless you want to reroll to an EU server(Razorgore) and I'll help you up hahah.
---
When does this happen? A later expansion?
---
Join a guild. Raid with them. Problem solved.
---
This feature wasnt added until wrath pre patch (I think). No changes.
---
Revenge, shield block, and slam should all be kept on cooldown
---
This photo is too powerful.
---
But why does it work for Warlocks summoning themselves, and not for other people?
---
I play a paladin, so the numbers won’t be perfect crossover, but I’m thinking for me it would be 350-400 +healing before I start actively switching out.
---
https://www.wowdownrank.com
---
This site will give you an idea, as it shows at what +healing it starts being most efficient to downrank heals.
---
It seems that if you steal they will punish you, but not make things right with the victim.
---
As a mage, mp5 is like our least important stat.  The last time I even remotely came close to running out of mana between gems/pots/evocation/robe of the archmage was when we were 20 manning Ony and half the raid died to an errant breath when she landed for phase 3 so the fight took an extra few minutes.
---
Likewise, no pvp encounter in vanilla is going to last long enough for fucking mp5 to matter.
---
I want this just so I can get milked.
---
From TBC onward i believe
---
It nullifies meaning of items and a big part of gearing and with that items’ rpg aspect. The achievement getting your first tier set is just infinitely higher without transmog. Another point is knowing your enemy. I’d see a warlock in full season 2 arena gear I’ll think twice attacking him. My first ‘wow’ moment I had was when I was saved by a 60 Grand Marshal Paladin when I was levelling my very first character. 
---
That’s some of my points.
---
Are you discriminating against someone based on their druidic beliefs?
---
I've been farming Mara for the last 2-3 days, though its a little less GPH and lesser chance of epic / high value items dropping. Mara is brain dead solo farming, have an alt in party and able to log out back and forth to reset and never leave the instance. 
---
Took me a couple runs to get the path of Princess just right, but now its clock work. I find myself not dying or even getting hit very often, which means less repair bills, and more time farming. With mining and killing these 2 bosses, I clear in about 12 minutes. 
---
With the reset time, about 4 runs per hour. Realistically, its about 30g a hour sometimes less, but its consistent. You log in at the start of the instance after each reset. 
---
Attempted the DM E jump runs solo, and they will certainly punish you for a mistake. Have done several 3 man jump runs, and they are just fine, but solo was another beast. Its very possible, and likely better GPH. 
---
For my time, It's so much more relaxed doing Princess runs. Even just selling the vendor loot &amp; mining, I made 300g in about 10 hours of farming, maybe a little longer.
---
There's not much raid gear available for DPS Warriors (and what they do get is highly contested) so as a result it's hard to gear up with them and some of your best pieces are hard to craft items. Most of the DPS Warriors I know are frustrated and leveling alts during most of their non-raid hours.
---
Paladin will have more gear to roll for in raids, but it's a mixed bag. Some they compete with other healers, some with mages/locks, and some is just meh at best for them in PvE and used primarily in PvP. So your Holy Paladin PvE set will be a mishmash of random stuff (many blues, a few purples, mix of cloth/leather/plate) that's considered PvE BiS while you have to gather a second set for PvP. So Holy Pally gearing might be less headache-inducing than DPS Warrior, but it's still a pain in the ass.
---
I know this isn't what you wanted to hear but at least you can make an informed decision.
---
&gt;would consistently have daily population peaks of 10-12k
---
Which is nothing compared to classic
---
Yeah it's fascinating to witness, especially for an item like Mark of the Dragon Lord that I would consider a 'newb trap'
---
I mean, I ran BRD with him so he could get materials for his libram enchant. He was a trusted core member of the guild.
---
Troll
---
Singing the song 'I believe I can fly', doesn't let you actually be able to fly.
---
Also Breastplate of Annihilation from first AQ40 boss, if memory serves.
---
Do you really want to argue with these people ?
---
One option is to change guild to some that uses a better dkp system. Mine uses fixed cost for items, but they cost a % of your dkp and not a flat amount to discourage dkp hoarding.
---
Another option is to join a guild that just started using dkp or will start to use dkp soon.
---
I don't fully disagree, but this is a poor argument when we're talking about one of the worse endgame epic items
---
My memory may fail me, it was a long ass time ago. But I remember picking up the quest to go in there, doing as much of the quests inside as possible (all of the armor scraps, the cavalry, all the upgrades, capturing mines, everything I could). What I do remember is thinking how stupid it was that I came out, turned in the quest that rewards you with the ice barbed spear, and instantly vendoring it to buy the unstoppable force (main reason I went in the first place). Also, I had horrible gear, had just dinged 60 and mainly just stayed back and watched the pretty fireworks that casters were putting out. Maybe it was 2 battles? Can you pick up the quest for IBS right away?
---
My 2 cents from when I leveled: skip ww axe. Run rfk to get corpsemaker. You will get ravager at 37. Ww axe takes time to get unless you have a main or a friend to help you usually won't get the axe until late 30s and it slows down leveling because you have to travel all over and get materials. Ravager will suit you extremely well dungeon grinding through cathedral and them zf. I used mine until level 53 ish.
---
&gt;tokens instead of set piece on their very next expansion
---
Hell, those started in ZG and were continued in AQ20, AQ40, and Naxx.  Direct set pieces dropping stopped after BWL.  Blizzard themselves quickly realized how bad it is to have direct set items drop.
---
I'm aware healbot does. That is what I use. But I really like the look of this LUF. I'll just have to wait untill I get home to try it out.
---
You can also look at it in a way of "that's how Blizzard solved loot drama. By guaranteeing that it can't possibly happen anymore".
---
&gt;Salv is clutch as fuck
---
Salv is crutch as fuck...
---
\~FTFY
---
They are in the back index... many pages worth. It reads like "Kurmokk - Ruins of Aboraz, D-6 (map coords), Lvl 42 Very Rare; Patrols through Mistvale Valley toward the road heading into Booty Bay" So you pop on over to page 47 and find D-6 and start patrolling that path.
---
\*Edit Stranglethorn vale is actually page 74, my bad.
---
Here, take my downvote
---
Hehe
---
There definitely was a "you are about to be saved to this dungeon ID" with an accept or decline option. This was also definitely not in any version of vanilla.
---
You only get saved if at least one boss has been killed. No way to know how many without clearing, but it's not fresh.
---
As a DPS warrior (you know the 90% of warriors, as raids just don't need more than 2-3 tanks yet) I don't mind tanking dungeons, I have a tanking gear set, I am fury, but I know how to handle threat well enough.
---
But as someone who hasn't run LBRS since 2006, I am going to need help and direction on where to go.  I don't mind tanking as a role, but 9 times out of 10, the tank is the leader of the group, and I don't always want to lead every 5 man.
---
It’s doesn’t work if the warlock is in the instance. You have to be outside the instance when summoning in order to accept it when you hearth to repair
---
He must have bubble hearthed
---
DK’s are unfortunate but not immediately punishing. You have to rack up a couple for them to truly affect your rank. Just a single DK won’t do much.
---
As a warrior i have to deal with so much bs i try to be nice just to get shit done. Most healers are chill but dps is a crap shoot especially on loot drops
---
Yeah, this incident has completely killed my spirits. Went from 50-59 in Phase 2. This happened and I've just stopped. I think it's time for a hiatus.
---
Does hunter track hidden stack with those?
---
- Have one person shouting melee in out in out etc
---
- Spread ranged out so you have space
---
- No one standing next to anyone else with a mana bar
---
- Healers get priority on positions against the walls
---
- Healers marked up
---
- Specific jobs for every healer
---
- One tank 315 Fire Res buffed
---
- Ranged immediately pop cooldowns
---
With a full group you should kill him before a submerge fairly easily. Our first kill was with 33 and we had him on 3% at the submerge. If not collapse on phase 2
---
- AOE down the adds
---
- Keep one add banished for the rest of the fight
---
That's in fact the most common situation in the Chapel, a huge Ally raid camping and killing everyone ipso facto when they land at the flight master.

Yes, people have the Rank 2 trinkets already

Never said it was a lot of runs.. I ran it 150-200 times in vanilla helping guildies. It's just surprising that one hasn't dropped in 20 runs. Your epeen must be hard as fuck though.

First excuse was “brb, cats on fire”

Shit just got serious.

SPOILER ALERT: Next week they take that 40 man to some world pvp and barely squeeze out a win vs a 5 man alliance group

---
I prefer the /lick.
---
Healing isnt more casual, but ive noticed healers are pretty chill about loot where as DPS get really aggy when they lose their grails (Staff of Dominance, Perdition's, BRE).
---
Pre-BIS also isnt nearly as important, you dont need to hit a minimum threshold of +hit stats or worry about certain meme items. The hardest part would be getting some of the big ticket healer items like the staff off BRD emperor or the cloth chest in live Strat.
---
If you are PvPing with mages, a priest would be a good choice as you can power infusion one of the mages and the amount of CC you have would be bananas.
---
He does. And then &gt;!turns zombie from kissing his wife who miraculously didn't die here and eats people.!&lt;
---
I get it. I don't think it's worth crying about it. It's part of the classic experience.
---
Am I the only one who really wants to tank using this method?
---
But a stranger to you, just not to the guild.  Bummer
---
I'm on stallag ally I know your pain.
---
Friday night they had a raid of 20 roamin I side IF
---
I'm a pvp hunter, and I have attack (melee) and wing clip on 1 &amp; 2, and then multi-shot, sting, concussive shot, arcane shot and aimed shot. I always have the highest level version bound - why do you mention having the lowest level of the shots bound as well? I'm new to this - what benefit does using the lowest level shot have?
---
Have you thought about this having to do with you summoning some one to an instance? Like really curious you never had some one else do this?
---
Eve kind of does it, but it does so by slowing time in the area. When you get into massive fleet battles, time dilation can become extreme. This kind of works for Eve, but I am not sure it would be reasonable for wow. At a minimum, it would not feel much like classic.
---
Nope, he's wrong. Your macro looks fine and it works.
---
The only reasons I can think for it to fail are that you don't have enough mana or that you don't have a friendly target or that your target has passed out of range.
---
Are you implying that this game is designed around having an organized group of teammates whom you get together with 1 or more times a week to accomplish a common goal?? Someone get me my pitchfork!
---
I'm a priest and made friends with a prot pally at 60. Like our play styles really click, and he knows with me around the group has to really fuck up to wipe. And he brought his brother, a mage in.
---
We run EVERY instance short of MC together. Dude's a God-tier tank. We bring along extra dps just to speed up the process, and we leave them bewildered just because they have no clue what to make of us.
---
I bubble the pally, pally runs into numerous packs, tossing sparkles, the mage starts aoe'ing like crazy, and I concentrate my heals on ensuring the pally never dies, and everything around him drops. If things go awry, I rev up the ol' "Oh shit!" priest engine, and ensure every member possible survives.
---
Picked up some random for a live Strat run the other day. Mid way through, the pug stops and says "you...you're treating this like it's deadmines"
---
Pull 2 to 4 packs, kill em all quick, keep it moving. I love playing with those two, and they've convinced me they can't find another healer that lets them do it the way we do together. 
---
TL;DR Pally tanks are the fucking shit and I love you all.
---
Yep, leveling that with my bud right now. Finished all of Darkshire in like 5 hours. It's so ridiculous
---
Its not on that level. Its far, and strong. But 99% the time you see it or realize that hunters are a counter and to play smarter around them.
---
Ive loaned out 1k to guildies, and theyre paying me back.
---
Nailed it.
---
I'm lvl 37 on Thalnos.  I haven't been ganked anymore than usual.  Questing in Dustwallow Marsh at the moment.
---
No body has said forsaken yet? Forsaken. EZ diet.

You could for a few days. It was a bug and has been fixed.

I stuffed up and learned enchanting instead of alchemy. Uh, how do I unlearn it so I can learn how to make potions instead?
---
NO MEMES ONLY DREAMS. HAND OF RAG IS MY BIRTHRITE
---
The gold farmers are another issue and I don't like that either, but I'm not sure what can be done about it other then banning anyone who advertises in game gold for real cash.
---
The people I'm talking about though were bots for sure.  In most cases probably farmers using bots, ok.  They mostly had weird gibberish names or even chinese sounding ones, but I saw a few from big guilds doing it as well.
---
Not sure what's going on here, but afaik this isnt even possible. At 11 lvls below it should be a 100% miss rate. At the very least, 22 levels below would be.
---
After leveling a troll shaman to 60 and now being a level 30 tauren I much prefer the tauren over the troll.
---
Warstomp saves me all the time, especially in world pvp. The extra health and range is nice too. It also looks cooler.
---
I have no desire to play orc even though they might be slightly better.
---
Warlocks would be a real pain in the ass being able to do SL/SL in vanilla with destros damage
---
But it's easy to get Jed if people aren't lazy. And a pain if people are.
---
Another easy solution is to used a trusted third party to hold both the money and the materials in escrow until the transaction is complete.

Good thing I brought my board!

yoo hit me up with that Skooma
---
lol omg... this is what "saved" means... people kept telling me "youre a guildie and youre already saved" and now i understand what they meant. (i was low level and offering to sub out)
---
It’s pretty easy to 2-man the last two parts
---
What’s your over healing look like?
---
Realisticly he should tip (I would, 10g or so), but no where near normal crafting prices. Being apart of the guild means he helped obtain that recipe, either directly (killing the boss that dropped it) or indirectly (helping kill other bosses that dropped loot for other guildmates who killed the boss that dropped it). 
---
At the end of the day though, if someone is offering to craft something for free, then it should be free and not *free with strings attached*
---
Has anyone been able to confirm that the blue PvP class sets are out though?
---
Elevator Operators are my favorite.
---
You can sell them to me lolol :p
---
That's how a lot of people hit 14, you need a guild to carry you there. getting rank 14 is server politics.
---
Man i feel bad for you. Hopefully you get some help from people who can
---
I think 600ish iirc
---
I played Alliance on Mal'Ganis but we were similarly outnumbered.  Ironically, Elitist Jerks were actually pretty nice and rarely if ever ganked.
---
Rolled PvE server this time around since I have less time to play and I didn't want to waste it dealing with gankers/griefers/etc.  Especially since I never saw the point of ganking anyway (I BG'ed instead)
---
I dream about that combo EM+NS would make chain lightning just one hit groups of people.
---
Hold a scavenger hunt. Whoever brings you a few different items wins. Make them things like grey drops, the kind of stuff people can't just hit up the AH for.
---
Can someone explain one thing to me... Why is there more horde players on PvP servers due to racials, when there's absolutely NO skill involved in the sort of PvP that takes place in the world? Who need op racials when you're always going to outnumber your opponents? Alliance doesn't play fair either. Fair PvP simply does not exist in this game.
---
* Environmental planning became sloppy after flying ref. wotlk zones were awful to navigate and hardly connected with each other in a meaningful way.
---
* Wpvp died the second death, the first being introduction of cross-realm battlegrounds (some noobs can't make a distinction between battlegrounds and cross-realm battlegrounds)
---
* Flying was poorly executed because it doesn't participate to the gaming world. For normal mounts there is obstacles such as hills or cliffs which give varied experience regardless your mount speed. It still doesn't eliminate the environmental effects such as possible mobs and makes player engaged with the world. Flying doesn't have any of these. There's just few platforms here and there (Dalaran being most notable of these), but no any kind of interplay between the concept. There's no clouds, no dangerous winds, no dragons, birds or any flying creatures that could bring variety to the experience. Flying in the air doesn't contribute anything to the gaming experience. The only thing it translates the appreciation of hand crafted environment for trivila speed boost which was one of the steps that turned wow into garbage.
---
So many questions...
---
More than just Hellfire Peninsula.
---
Terokkar Forest had Spirit Towers that you fought to control to get a 5% buff to a couple stats. Zangarmarsh had the Twin Spires which would give your faction a zone wide buff. And of course there was the Halaa in Nagrand, my personal favorite. You would seige the city by bombing from a flying mount, then you would go in and take control of the city. Made for some pretty fun wPVP moments. Also rewarded one my favorite mounts at the time, the [talbuk](https://www.wowhead.com/item=29228/reins-of-the-dark-war-talbuk)
---
You needed 8 warriors with 4-piece *tier 3* set bonuses to completely eliminate the chance of a resisted taunt, just one of which during the fight would likely cause a wipe. It was a good old fashioned gear-check that guilds couldn't even start working towards until Nax opened.
---
Oh please, you work at a morgue or something?  Digging up 6' of dirt is a bitch... especially when your already hungry...
---
Funnily enough, even with unlimited talent points, druid would still be a bad dps, even compared to classes with the normal amount of talent points.  
---
That's how far off the balance is for druids.
---
You act as if it couldn't happen to you. I pray someone does it, just so you know how it feels :)
---
Also funny how you had nothing to say about the rest of the message, almost as if your idea wasn't as fleshed out as you thought it was and are now trying to ignore it.
---
Nope, NS is off the GCD and it can be used with another spell in one keypress.
---
That would be siiiiiiiick. I'd love to save some money on my mount so that I can put my focuses on getting Lionheart.
---
&gt; I even think there are more undead quests about making a plague and/or murdering humans than there are about fighting their actual existential threats, the Scourge and Scarlet Crusade.
---
All plague quests are by definition quests about fighting the Scourge because the plagues are designed as a catchall weapon against the Scourge and the living.
---
&gt; Ah ok. never knew there was a portal you could walk into for MC.
---
Technically the only portal is deep in BRD. The window just teleports, you don't see the big swirly circle.
---
Especially listing an epic on AH is really painful. I‘d say just scream it in trade chat and wait for offers.
---
Scams like this are part of wow. Next time you hand mats to anyone, get a collateral.
---
Go play some Eve Online to get used to scams.
---
Honestly, it does sound like a joke. There's not even an instance swirl. I'm not surprised you didn't believe it.

Whats CS mean?

There’s a healthy medium that is ideal.

Oof. I mean im glad ur topping damage meters as an arms war, but honestly that just means your guild is terrible.

I saved a mage from a 2 v 1 he was losing. After I healed him up and buffed him (fortitude), I wispered him and asked if I could buy some water. 
---
He put 2 stacks in the trade window and whispered back "4g".....
---
Nice.  Maybe he was trying to avoid the repair bill.
---
I picked up trustrike on my hunter the other day. Beat 2x rogue and 1x warrior. 
---
I felt bad, but then I only needed it to hit cap vs ?? Mobs. I didn’t even equip it immediately :(
---
But, my thoughts, you’ll lose it lots and only need to win it once. It’ll drop again!
---
It's OK. I lost a Hand of Justice to a feral druid, me being a fury warrior. Just gotta move on 😭
---
It's more like "I'm watching tv/eating, and dont wanna actually play, but I can sit and spam for some extra gold"
---
I get that. But what I'm saying is I see "a bunch of immunes" 100% of the time. How do I know when to break block?
---
.....so you HAVE been around the track a few times, eh?
---
Ofc, so when I yell ZUGG ZUGG in public it won’t be as awkward
---
Not only is it impossible to revert, but it poisoned every other MMO as well until like... recently.
---
Every dev decided that if they didn't check the "has flying mounts!" box then they can't compete with WoW for like a decade straight.  And you bet they came with the same design problems as they did in WoW- skip over all the world and all the content and just drop right on top of the thing you need.
---
currently running a shaman as my main.  This is what I did:
---
* levels 1-24: str = agi, literally just use whatever gives the most stats
---
* levels 25-40: as much agility as you can, since flurry procs from crits
---
* levels 41-60: I switched to elemental here, but if you stay enhancement you will want to stay with agility.  If you switch to elemental, you want +Int gear.
---
And alliance still wonder why they keep losing world pvp? :)
---
When you see the least amount.
---
keep totem twisting in mind
---
anyone knows why they only camp LHC btw? RP refugees on non RP servers?

#nochanges boyzzz

Cherry picked example
---
You don’t have to cherry pick to find one the opposite way
---
Arcane Crystals/Bars are one of the most consistent crafting materials throughout all of Vanilla/Classic. There isn't really a time when they will not be needed and will dip in price. The gold you get for them will be less valuable the longer you wait to sell them though.
---
Why focus on the 'stranger' aspect when the real issue here is Blizzards complete lack of proper support on the matter at hand? Or the different support in Classic vs Retail?
---
so like on retail you trade someone 10000g, and on classic they trade you 100g? there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, cause who cares what happened on retail, all someone did was give you 100g on classic lol. but dont go opening a ticket to blizz if the dude on classic decides to not give you 100g after you traded 10k on retail.
---
I'm in full pre bis and I couldn't care less about loot. I got my benediction finally after waiting (we had 5 leaf drops back to back) and now finally got the third eye for myself. We are a stable group we will all get our gear. Why push it I don't understand.
---
I’ve always wanted to be a human
---
It's really hard to tell when that is
---
On the BWL thing. I am actually looking forward greatly to the raid and probably because I've never seen BWL in my life.
---
But like you were saying. A somewhat smug/selfish reason of mine, is hopefully seeing the end of "this game's sooooooo easy" threads here on reddit. Fine MC's easy, fine guilds cleared it second week of release blah blah so on and so forth.
---
I just want to say that we didn't kill Rag in phase 1 until more of the dps got more gear together and we got a little more organized. Granted yes we've had him on farm for weeks, but far from us killing him in phase 1, in all dungeon blues and greens. I still think that for all the people running in here saying "sooo easy sooooooo easy, even with lvl 55's in raid lol". Yet they never talk about the effort the main tanks had to go through to collect FR gear, and absolutely don't talk about the people who are honestly carrying the others.
---
But anyways I am absolutely looking forward to the upheavals, the people who all expect that BWL will be equally as easy as MC, get it thrown in their faces. And if somehow BWL doesn't accomplish that, then AQ40 when their main tanks and healers get poached by other guilds, setting their progression right back to MC.
---
He COULD craft it, HE just decided to take the mats and split. The issue wasn't him giving mats to a person that couldn't craft it, It's that he gave them to someone who could and that took the mats and server transfered. AGuildie nonetheless.
---
Dal rends are not even pre bis for hunters :/
---
Deathbringer. Spinal is Rag.
---
I wouldn't eff with a multi boxer. The reason being blizzs reporting system sux and if a few boxers report you youll get autobanned or silenced until a gm looks into it. Not worth your time.
---
How much does the AV mount cost?
---
It was 4 AM. He offered high end armor crafting services to me in the past. I did research before hand. I should have noted this though.
---
You are correct its not that important.  But i was just curious
---
if it was rl i wouldnt give things to a stranger. idiot.
---
What, like come together as a community? Why is classic so inconvenient?
---
Can sit stealthed at front of Dire Maul, kill clothies as they run in. I know bc Im a clothy and get jumped there.
---
it means it sounds like you are crying.
---
The winterspring place where people farm the Eye of Shadow should be good. Everyone just does it in pairs and you could easily kill them when they pull a mob I think. Worth a try at least.
---
Smolderweb seems pretty balanced. Its pretty much 50/50 on whether alliance will have control of the path leading out of kargath or the entrance to BRM.
---
they are depending on the method
---
Nah I'm being lazy and haven't set one up despite having a couple add-ons capable of doing it. I honestly don't run a lot of group content and am still leveling.
---
I hate to be negative but I can't wait for all the phases to be old news. Hopefully the hardcore players will get bored and leave the game to more casual/lenient players. I tried to stay positive about Classic but the player base really wore me out with their constant need for min-maxing, bis, etc. 
---
I may return for AV but I'll probably wait until AB is out too.
---
We RP walked from Barrens to Thralls Keep, which is something I never thought I would do. It was epic, and I'm really happy I decided to roll on this server. 
---
GG's Grobbulus &lt;3
---
Razorgore actually seems to be a pretty balanced server in terms of H/A ratio
---
That's impossible to confirm since those items are inside the pvp ranker instance which requires rank 6 to enter. Highest rank atm is r4, could be confirmed later this week.
---
Meh the thing is, if u use NS + EM the gcd will prevent you from squeezing in a free shock crit right after the CL essentially reducing your possible damage out of EM by 40%.
---
Would still be sick to have it ofc. As an option
---
Ackchyually his name is Saitama.
---
Why focus on the 'stranger' aspect when the real issue here is Blizzards complete lack of proper support on the matter at hand? Or the different support in Classic vs Retail? 
---
This used to be something Blizzard would fix without hesitation, and now just because someones playing classic, they're entitled to less support than someone playing retail. Player clearly gets scammed, has records of it happening. Blizzard goes and punishes the player, but refuses to restore stolen items.
---
What kind of assbackwards logic is that? We're talking about like what? 5 more button presses by Blizzard to right the wrong?
---
&gt;Except in this case he was a stranger to OP, he even said so.
---
So your argument doesnt hold up. The dude was 100% a stranger to OP.
---
He wasn't a complete stranger though, there's such a thing as reputation and presence. From what I read he was active in the guild and was known quite well by many. This wasn't a blindly trusting a stranger situation, more like going with these windows guys over those windows guys because of recommendation and reputation and advertising. You shouldn't be focusing on the stranger aspect though, that's a small part of this.
---
Don’t if they don’t drink. Maybe a renew at most. Tell em to life drain. Or he can tap and eat. Either way taxing your gold is dick
---
Classic was a wild run away success and took blizzard completely by surprise. But rather than capitalizing on that an quickly shifting priorities and expanding the number of people dedicated to maintaining and expanding classic they did... nothing. they haven't made any changes or devoted any more resources to the project and have plowed on with decisions that are actively harming the userbase. 
---
I fully expect blizzard to kill their own golden goose. Rather than develop Classic into something that is a viable option to retail.
---
no thanks, my goldfish just caught on fire, but gl
---
I think a lot of people here think transferring gold means literally transfering 100k from a retail character directly to a classic character.
---
Why isn't the norm to do collateral trading with crafting recipes like this? I'm getting ready to craft my helm as well, and my plan is to ask the crafter (non-guildy, but has crafted before for people in server) for 500 gold for mats while he crafts, and I'll give him the 500 back plus the 250 he's charging. This assures if anyone fucks anyone else over at any point in the transaction, they have a marginal gain from their losses
---
You want Herbalism if you are ever going to farm DM lashers for gold.
---
I think people want to drive home the point that getting corpse-camped non-stop trying to quest is far less fun than doing dungeons, even if you think that's tedious.
---
I find this very appealing
---
Just go into the mountain, where alliance outnumber 20:1 at every hour.
---
Tell him to life tap every 5 seconds. Cast your heal over time always  If hes abusing life tap its on him.!
---
Edit,  i usually will stop life tapping at 50% unles a priest tells me a big heal will be cast on me
---
Wat
---
Yeah, we had all of our priests respec to PI because healing is easy at this point and PI makes kills faster.
---
RING RING RING RING RING RING BANANA PHONE
---
That’s not necessarily true. If it costs me 25 rage to shapeshifter and throw heals without much threat generation, that’s be a good thing to know
---
I pity the peasant warrior who thinks 100g a week is expensive at all.  Probably calls himself an arms warr and doesnt even have stronghold gauntlets. Chilling in rank 2.
---
The problem is you talents are doing 3 distinct things that dont stack but say a hunter or rouges talents are all things they could use together to compliment each other.
---
Optimal warlock dps involves a few gcds dedicated to taps. If they have high enough spell power it can tap like 25% of their hp so that hp has to be replaced somehow. People always seem to disagree on the how.
---
Expecting a lock to bandage is silly cause that will become very expensive and cost inefficient at the end of a dungeon. Expecting him to sit there and eat level 45 food and water when there's no mage is silly too. The best solution I've come up with as a warlock main is to never let mana get below 20% unless necessary while in combat and just wand if I have nearly less then that and like 30% hp. If there's a mage he should hitting a food and water macro out of combat every chance he gets but the mage shouldn't be a cunt and give him 1 stack of water and call it a day either.
---
Lol sorry that's my rant. It's all subjective to the healers experience I suppose
---
In my experience? Not really. But if they are competitive with quest rewards and dungeon gear at that level range (like the shining silver breastplate), then they usually fetch a decent price.
---
Some of the crafted items are a great starting point for twinks, so their demand rises as well.
---
Just look up the item on auctioneer before crafting, that way you can see if there is a market.
---
its 1:1500 on EU at moment.
---
No... That's sort of the point of this post, you're trapped in YOUR servers perspective, or you're in the reddit echochamber where it's only "HORDE BAD, ALLIANCE UNDERDOGS" when there are servers and situations where that's simply not the case.
---
You'll be fine until you are upper level 40s.  At that point I'd bet BGs have been released (dec 10th) and the open world will be much less hostile.  So pretty much you'll be fine.
---
I would imagine you could just say, "I thought he was having a tough time getting to MC and thought I would help him." Honestly if someone did this to me, I would assume that was their thought process.
---
Pally tanks are definitely the best aoe tanks in 5 man's. However as a healer in dungeons past that, they just take so much more damage than a warrior. I'm not the best healer but it just seems so much more difficult to heal you guys.
---
AV queue is pretty close to Southshore. WSG isn't near anything lol. Oh but I forgot city queues will be in.
---
As a fellow Horde, you do not want our females. I'd take a female Dwarf over Horde girls.
---
Practice. Also make sure all your barriers are up before you iceblock so you have a little safety net when you release.
---
afk cat lit grandma on fire
---
I’m alliance on Blammo and I also don’t think it’s as bad as people claim. There are clearly more horde, but after the first week of PvP insanity everything seems much more
---
manageable. Easy to find small WPvP groups and we tend to do pretty well despite the overall number disadvantage; haven’t run into many issues getting to instances as long as we travel as a group; boats can be problematic but I’ve started buying ports or using my engineering transporter when I need to cross the ocean.
---
LOL I'm on the far right of this line up, off screen.
---
Glad to be in such a great guild, the run was epic!
---
Yup.  Though in fairness, when you are a fresh 60 and want to run dungeons for gear, the last thing you want to do is stop that and turn around and try to coordinate a pitched world battle against a bunch of coordinated alliance with gear and sappers.
---
My only question is where's all the geared horde.
---
Thanks for your input. I do hope too, that in some shape or form, the game will be playable again for both factions and the motivation for playing a certain faction will not be based on which side dominates. 
---
I referred specifically to the in-game part of the world when I claimed that it would stay true to no changes, which was left out of your quotation. I do agree, of course, that this would be something that would tremendously affect a large population in the beginning. At the same time, I also think that if it was combined with faction transfers, it could lead to a more even and competitive overall World PvP scene in the long run.
---
&gt; The thing with engineering tools, everyone gets them. Ultimately every class that wants to can have their mobility + engineering. Shaman will always have no base mobility to add to that.
---
It's no the best mobility out there, but 1s cast ghost wolf is still kinda nice.
---
Do you have some footage of an Ele shaman doing good burst damage? I'm not totally against checking out an Ele + Enh spec, just not sure if it's really worth it.
---
What class do you play?
---
The FR buff in lbrs makes it pretty easy tbh.
---
If you have mana to spare then go ahead and heal them. 
---
Any lock choosing to lifetap over drink assumes all risk knowing they are last priority. 
---
If he is draining his health down to incredibly obnoxious levels you might say something to him but otherwise just toss some heals when you have mana to spare and continue to prioritize the tank, yourself
---
QQ
---
Mograine is balanced if you want a high populated server
---
I'd throw a hot on him when you have mana.
---
They should be drinking/eating with everyone else though. It's not fair to assume you'll heal them after drinking yourself.
---
Thanks I'll take one death pls
---
thats been around for like what 30 years? 
---
Gay people have been a thing for more then 30 years
---
Im on there too. Not fun anywhere on that server as a 56 hordie
---
And if they are pvp spec (which most probably are now), they don’t have the threat reduction talents. So mind blast is a definite no-no
---
That's why most guilds will start a Raid 2.
---
Sure, they aren't as good, and may not down Rag every time, but it's a more level playing field as it's usually people with low DKP and PUG's.
---
Respectfully, even with superior mp5 and +healing to other healers in your raid you might not end up top heals. Raid healing actually as a bit of skill involved, being able to foresee large spikes of damage and have heals pre-casted will result in more healing done. If you are waiting for tank/raid members health bars to reach 50% before you even cast the heal, youll probably get beaten to the punch.
---
Ony is a good example, if you can time your efficient heals with her auto attack swings you can pre-cast and get those heals off in time instantly. That sort of metagaming has more effect on meter placement than having more mp5 or +healing stat.
---
PTSD from being camped by Goon Squad
---
Typically grouping out with another rogue is the best option for you, allows to pick off any target, and if there's multiple to cc. 
---
But anywhere pvpers go is nice, burning steppes is usually not that high popped, if you stand at the entrance to BRM you can pick people off, also various places in feralas has high traffic, sometimes too high though. That's really your issue, consistent 1man traffic, no groups. If there's hillsbrad fight going on, then typically horde will have pushed down, and you can sit in tarrensmill to pick off people joining the battle or afk at FP.
---
Always try to kill players twice or 3 times, get those free respawn kills in adds up a lot.
---
&gt; They are punishing the scammer
---
There is no evidence of that.  Purely good faith that rests on an abysmally bad track record.
---
&gt;Blizzard also stated they will not restore any items lost.
---
In instances of player culpability.  This is not that.
---
That's some b*******
---
That's the old school poison animation, and there will be a lot of complaining if it gets changed to the retail version.
---
Only people who no life can roll. Everyone else is just there to help you out. Got it.
---
Blizzard stated they will not get involved in loot distribution and they will not restore lost or stolen items. That is why. I think it’s a dumb policy as well, but it’s just like OP is Kyle in the South Park Human Centipad episode (someone else mentioned this comparison and it hilariously makes sense). 
---
What ever happened to #nochanges ?
---
if its 75/25, the server will be dead. there's no way the 25 will stay, and so the solution of "do nothing" isnt acceptable either.
---
Scammers are cancer and need to be eradicated.

uhhhh ok

You have the sender/recipient backwards for a fake screenshot joke there bud
---
i am not trying to explain anything away.  i dont really get much out of ganking lower level players, in fact i typically avoid it unless i see them ganking people themselves or theyre in a crowd of people fighting.  
---
i would imagine for most people its simply pressing a button on someone in a video game and they dont think about it afterward.
---
That does sound very cool, but I don’t think it will ever happen sadly. :(
---
According to [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pve-stat-priority), 1 agility is worth ~2.5 AP. That's 47.5 AP from the AGI item, so it's a wash on that front. But AGI also gives you increased crit and dodge chance, and increased armor. AGI also stacks with buffs, so one buff raises all those stats.
---
So based on that I'd go with the AGI piece.
---
I'm finding it difficult to peel myself away from this post
---
That happens in WotLK, when the acheivement system was added
---
Post public video on youtube. Calls it a secret.
---
I know where to find you now...
---
&gt;but they could easily claim
---
I mean, the matts for that helm cost a similar amount to an epic mount... it's entirely reasonable for someone to not have that much gold around.
---
Blizzard should be using the money we pay them to fund appropriate support so that this isn't an issue.
---
Do open bidding
---
&gt;  I wanted it because it was purple and rare and I didn’t want the other player to have it. 
---
\- Gollum, seeing his first epic.
---
I mean I get no changes but this proposed change has zero impact on anything other than saving someone accidentally missing being able to raid for the week. This isn’t a mechanic change or a drop rate change or anything.
---
In Burning Crusade, if you flew over the opposite faction's base then flying guards would come in and knock you off your flying mount. Don't know why they didn't expand on that.
---
If I was that person I'd be like sure! Everyone acting like you should get something in return but it's not about that. You want to help a guildie and they should want to help you. It's mutually beneficial. It's probably not the best way for you to farm but you're being nice. Don't see why they won't want you to benefit too.
---
DM east jump runs for sure. For solo you need to be shadow (well technically you can do it as healer but it would take forever) and mining is a must.
---
"immoral to lock people out of their characters/servers when they are paying a monthly fee to play the game" youre kidding right? they do this now with queues, like right now, and have been since forever.
---
offer a transfer/faction change. i am unable to play my alt because every FP I go to is camped, I get sapped/MC'd and ran around so I make 0 progress. you're telling me this is better than having horde sit in a queue for a bit? youre being dramatic and idiotic
---
I'm a little disappointed(but not surprised) that merely stating your views earned you so far, 2 downvotes.
---
Nothing you said was in the slightest offensive nor non-contributing. As for the personal loot...and it's been a while since I've touched retail, but the first time I saw the mechanic in action, I was a little surprised like "oh it's like this now?" type of reaction.
---
I don't remember feeling especially negative about it, but it did hit me, that suddenly it's all system-driven and not socially/group driven as to who gets what anymore. I knew at that moment that the feeling was very different though.
---
The game was moving in a direction that's more solo-friendly than it was group-driven by humans to make decisions.
---
Are you implying that the game doesn’t also encourage a massive online multiplayer environment where playing with strangers is rewarding too??? If only I knew there was a single way to play the game!!!
---
It's funny because you wouldn't be able to use any of those useful talents in moonkin form.
---
I was just trying to get raid ready. My helmet was severely lacking. I had farmed up most of the gold for my mount and saved some mats on the side for the helmet. With this deal I could've gotten both in a timely manner.
---
But you dont know my server :)
---
Seems like all you want to do is put people down. Dont you have something more productive to do?
---
TURURURURURURURURURU-

---
And time. Opportunity cost in economic terms.
---
When I played in real vanilla, the standard for expensive stuff was to trade mats+ tip for the item itself, then the crafter would turn around and sell the mats or just float them.
---
Like if you were getting crusader enchant, enchanters would float enough mats, so you’d pop your weapon in the do not trade slot, they’d have the enchant on it,  and you’d put in all the mats + the agreed tip. 
---
That said, for a trusted guildie I wouldn’t expect for something like that to happen and I’d just trade them the mats.
---
Do you have an actual image? Photobucket has blurred this out with a watermark. Why do people still use Photobucket. Upload to imgur. Reddit's uploader is perfectly fine for static images as well.
---
It's much more likely he is instance farming.
---
Okay here is a question... when something says “increases your chance to crit by 1%” what does that mean?
---
Does it mean if I have a 10% chance already that I now have a 10.1% ?
---
Or does it mean I now have an 11% chance of criting?
---
I imagine it is the latter but the statistician in me wants to make sure.
---
The ideal emote.
---
I always imagine it like the licking scene from terminator 2.
---
I figure it can help some Alliance until BG's anyways.
---
Because if they would they would have had to add the whole ingame shop aswell to justify the investment to their shareholders and their bottom line.
---
It`s not the Devs fault. It's the management. 
---
Don't forget this is a corporation we're talking about and corporations need to stay profitable in the eyes of their shareholders and people need to be paid. 
---
Not defending this  behaviour but this is how it is and players tend to forget that. Blizzard will not do what is best for you, it will do what is best for Blizzard and that is totally fine/normal.
---
If you want changes you need to talk with your money &amp; engagement because that'll put the bottom line at risk.
---
I love it when people attempt to defend the horde by saying "this is how it was in vanilla #nochanges".....I was there. In Vanilla. It was never like this, on any server. What happens on 90% of classic servers EVERY day happened to maybe 10% of vanilla servers a couple times per week.
---
This is the same logic that people used trying to defend how good Spy was. "It WaS LiEk ThIs In VaNiLlA"... No it wasn't. I was there, I don't remember any addons being able to pick up stealth players at 100 yards. And now Blizz came out and fixed it.
---
Faction-based queue is a Meta change that would help restore the **actual vanilla experience** that #nochanges players claim to want.
---
The post specifically said that this is faction neutral as horde and alliance both suffer from the imbalance on different servers. Next time, try to put your tinfoil hat on before you comment. Cheers.
---
Human would be cool.  Then I wouldn’t have to replace my disguise every few days.

Ah, Maelkor and his Eternalanus. Really takes me back lol. We did not make many friends with that splinter.

Fun fact: we reported world first on Broodlord Lashlayer because our genius hunter remembered deviate fish could fear our warlocks through the gate that Blizz kept locked after Vael. Next patch "chance of fear removed from deviate fish."
---
But road kill bruh.
---
Yeah that goes to show how shit ice veins is.
---
I guess we're on our own. Blizzard has a new policy of "fuck you"
---
Not every guild is the same, I kinda had to go holy while we were filling out the roster and gearing people up.
---
Now THIS is the reddit content i wanted from classic
---
Rogues having improved combo builders and improved spenders would probably scale very well
---
WTT 1000 gold in classic for 300k in retail
---
Simple as that
---
Even better. ;)
---
IMO DPS-tanking can be pretty fun but actually sword and board + def tanking? That's fine for single target but feels beyond terrible for multi target IMO.
---
People are always trying to come up with more complicated, worse loot systems for some reason. Stop reinventing the wheel boys.
---
you're joking right? this isn't going to eliminate ganking, obviously, this is just going to make it so there it is way less likely that it will take you 1 hour to go to a dungeon from the closest FP. sometimes youll still be camped, and sometimes your faction will be doing the camping, but right now on my server, horde is 100% controlling every major FP / route to every 55+ dungeon. it's impossible to play without committing 1 extra hour to get that, and ~1 extra hour to convince other poor schmucks itll be worth it to go there.
---
Progression guilds that are working on AQ40 often stop running MC with their core raiders by that point as you can get better loot in AQ20 and ZG much faster. They often have a second raid group that focuses on MC and BWL seperately
---
Some where you have to draw the line for how much you want to interfere with the game. I get super nervous when a rare drops, and even if I'm the only person needing I can't breathe out until it's in my bag - knowing Blizz will sort any roll mistake takes away that extra level of uncertainty. Just my 2c
---
Christ thanks for sharing.
---
I have stockpiles for it already. Not because I've put in any special effort to this end, but because some materials useful for the war effort have been inordinately cheap. Almost not worth auctioning. Bank alts take almost no effort to make. So, why not fill a few alts worth of storage of stuff you'd maaaaybe get a gold for anyways?
---
Paid 100g for both rings, way more effiicient timewise.
---
what is this heroic strike cancel macro you speak of?
---
Fresh 60 rogue here, never done DM but I want x2 of that agi ring. I've heard that there's a way for hunters to solo it, and that they'll often sell the gear that drops. Can someone explain how this works? Do I have to be in the group from start to finish with them, or can they find out what dropped before inviting me? Where do I go to find this service? I've never seen anyone advertising this in any of the major channels or the dire maul general chat.
---
None of that comment makes sense.  A tinfoil hat isn't to help you read better.  Also you wanting to penalize both servers because you don't like the balance doesn't really make it "neutral".  It makes it "waaah, penalize the other team because they outnumber me!"
---
You're completely invisible, they can't see you at all.

The kor gem is the worst imo, you can solo it but the drop rate can really fuck you and horde running through will gank you for the lulz. I farmed for 30 minutes with 3 other paladins and finally got it. Would have taken way longer solo. Sfk is easy because it’s right in the courtyard, if you are in a guild ask a 60 to clear to the stables, takes them like 10 minutes if that.
---
I did LBRS runs with a warrior so he could get blackcrow.  It’s the only item I would need from LBRS but ran it 3 times knowing full well I wouldn’t roll on it so he could have it.
---
I played a bit on Lights Hope. It was busy, but it wasn't classic levels of busy. 
---
This'll almost certainly be done in the minimum/slightly over minimum levels of time on most servers.
---
It is a flat 1% increase to your total value. 10% base crit + 1% = 11% new crit chance
---
1 agi = 2 ap, but with the other stuff (crit etc) included they estimate it at 2.5. So those things are not 'on top of' of the 2.5 but already included, even taking that estimation that will mean it will lose with 0.5 AP from raw 48 AP.
---
I honestly dont see why 1/53% crit would be equal to 0.5 ap though, seems kinda too much for such a low crit number
---
Collect it from your loved ones and the things you leave to them....
---
This really sucks for you. However i believe there should be some risk in an MMO. You play a character, and if some players want to lie and scam, they should be somewhat free to do so. This just proves the importance of building trust within a guild, which i see as a huge factor in an MMO. 
---
Again, i feel for you this is a very shitty situation.
---
For sure. I always tried to offer the float when I was enchanting (it's harder to do for expensive, high-end craftables) because it's a much safer trade.
---
I would have 100% expected this to be a safe trade from a guildie. This is just a crap situation for the OP.
---
Buy a bunch of low rank buffs from the AH and stack them on you in BGs
---
Any BRD run you can get into until you hit 58. Depending on the group you may be allowed to do pretty much anything in BRD so just try for everything. At 58+ just start doing any other dungeons to collect your pre-raid BiS.

There might be more to it, but I believe Rag won't re-emerge until all the elementals are dead or the time runs out. Rag can be a mana intense fight, especially if healers are forced to pop fire pots instead of mana pots. The elementals also mana drain nearby, so if your mana users get caught out they can say goodbye to their remaining mana. Keeping one banished gives everyone a bit of a break to bandage up and regen mana through Spirit.
---
well the thing that bothers me is they used to do this all the time back in the day. It didn't even occur to me that they wouldn't do it. I actually told the guy "Yea dude, don't worry about it. They used to do this for us all the time back in the day and it usually takes like an hour for them to fix it"
---
Every freaking time.  Just keep the damn thing in your bags.
---
It was left out of my quotation because it's semantics. You're advocating for a huge change to how the game is played, the introduction of a system that was entirely absent from Vanilla, and you'd be absolutely affecting the way people are able to play the game. So you can't be both in favor of "no changes" while still suggesting an extreme change. 
---
And faction queues would, ultimately, impact the in-game world because it would warp people's ability to schedule raids, group up for BG pre-mades, and artificially stretch leveling and questing grinds. Faction queues 100% violate the idea of no changes. Again, if you think the pros outweigh the cons, that's your argument to make. But you can't hold both positions simultaneously, it's a paradox. 
---
Imagine if Alliance players had to pay more per month for their WoW account, or could only create 1 character per account. Nothing is changing "in-game" but I think everyone can agree those limitations would be against #nochanges. Faction queues are a less extreme but philosophically consistent example of that issue.
---
&gt;  At the same time, I also think that if it was combined with faction transfers, it could lead to a more even and competitive overall World PvP scene in the long run. 
---
Maybe. Or maybe the population of WoW is already invested in their faction, and trying to force them to change is completely against the appeal of the game. I think it's much more likely that you'd see people park themselves in queues or quit the game. Those who stayed would be even more likely to grief the other faction. And the whole time Blizzard would be dealing with a PR backlash and angry players unsubbing in mass. 
---
The best way to balance World PvP is to give players a reason to want to create even factions. Attempting to force players into one path or the other just leaves everyone feeling annoyed and unsatisfied. 
---
Want more people to play Alliance? Make Alliance more appealing. Move towards Classic +. 
---
Want to preserve #nochanges? Than accept Alliance and Horde will never be even because Blizzard put out deeply flawed game design in Vanilla 15 years ago. 
---
Faction queues aren't a silver bullet solution that solves faction imbalance while sticking to #nochanges. It's a watered-down half-measure that's going to make no one happy.
---
grats on doing what took most of us 5 days to do lol.
---
I think it was when the Blizzard GM said
---
&gt;next time try trading with a trusted person such as a guild member
---
To OP's problem of getting scammed by 
---
&gt;a trusted person such as a guild member
---
Yes it does. Pull 2 mobs have your pet tank one and spam life drain. You will pull aggro on the second mob. Any healing produces aggro.
---
I have seen it sold in trade chat and you can join later because its an item from the chest. I think if you spam trade that you want to buy the ring you will find a seller pretty often.

Classic has been fun but it's brought a level of drama and stress that makes everything unfun, both from myself and also from the community

---
"As a follow up for all the jealous, angry babies who think I "ruined" my Classic experience by accepting gold or masterlooting myself gear on my alt
---
Of course I'm not going to dedicate stream time to farming gold, it's boring as fuck lol
---
This would have happened regardless"
---
Sodapoppin mentioned himself that although Classic WoW is great, streaming it isn't. It's interesting that they feel that way, I wonder what makes it hard to stream when they love the game so much. (Stream snipers? Guild drama? I know Asmongold particularly has had a lot of guild drama.)
---
It seems like Sodapoppin may have had more enjoyment when he wasn't harrassed 24/7 on private servers compared to when he streams Classic perhaps?
---
Having a full time job and raising a family takes precedence unlike 15 years ago 🙃

I didn't realized this lol, it's kinda disappointing.
---
Not all races can use every mount either, there are some restrictions
---
You're basically asking to compare apples with oranges. But that's cool, we'll work with that. Think of healing as a fruit salad.
---
You want a healthy mix of all fruits for the best fruit salad. If there's only oranges or apples in it, it's not a salad, just pieces of fruits.
---
Back to WoW, how much of which you need mostly comes down to your playing style, raid composition and encounter, not to mention the rest of your gear.
---
On longer fights, you might need more mp5 than +healing, while on shorter fights, you might need more +healing than mp5.
---
If your guild runs MC with 6 healers, you won't gear the same as if it runs it with 12... Or at least, your gear won't be as relevant, since the more healers you've got, the higher the chances you can play around the 5 second rule, not to mention other healers can compensate if you're doing it wrong.
---
On the other hand, if you have very little mp5, any piece with mp5 becomes much more valuable than if you've already got tons of it, and the same is true with +healing (and other stats).
---
If someone would stack +healing greens that offer no other stat like INT, SPI, mp5, etc..., they could stack to +500 healing pretty easily, but they'd go OOM in seconds.
---
Finally, it also depends on how you play, if you downrank your spells a lot, cancel casts when relevant, play around the 5 second rule often and generally avoid overhealing, then you don't waste too much mana and don't need mp5 as much as if you're spamming heals non-stop.
---
Long story short, if you can't tell which piece is best, keep both and switch them around based on the fight you're healing.
---
tl;dr: The throughput (+healing) vs sustainability (mp5) debate is one that has no clear answer and heavily depends on too many factors for anyone to be able to simply say either is better than the other.
---

&gt; Just impacts that fat healing meter.
---
Healing meters are irrelevant as long as no one dies.
---
I've never been crazy about loot, of course I love getting a great drop as much as the next person but I  never really cared about losing a roll or passing for a guildie when it made sense. I stopped playing WoW at the end of BC.
---
Having a lot of fun with classic, found a decent guild. We have been raiding since early october as a 26 man group, and being 14 people down the gearing went quite a bit faster. I play a Shadow Priest, the guild uses a MS/OS roll with a 1 loot per ID. I am lucky because I am allowed to roll on gear I need with no questions asked . 
---
Anyway, as a SP there's not much I need in MC, and as people were getting a lot of gear, I thought that may allow me to get those 2-3 items sooner than I expected.. But turns out when the items drops I am still rolling against a lot of people. At first, it didn't bother me, but the last two raid I have been super frustrated losing the rolls to people with 4-6 pieces from MC while I have gotten no loot in 7 weeks. 
---
I understand that the issue stems mostly from my spec having only 3 items that are also useful for many other classes, and I haven't talked about my frustration to my guild as it feels sooo childish. Worst part is that we recruited heavily recently and are now fielding a 36 man raid, meaning I get to roll against even more people with some raiding for the first time with us xD . 
---
I was considering quitting, as I felt people were being inconsiderate.. Then realised: "wtf why do you now care about that loot" still haven't found the answer but am back to not really caring.

Because you do 133% increased damage with crits. Crit is the strongest scaling stat for hunters.
---
hey, I'm up for this!
---
Fake news. My banana god has 18 slot ony bags.
---
On Grobb, it seems that BRM is Horde controlled and Alliance gets LHC.
---
No, this is actually perfect place in the world of azeroth for you.
---
So far at the bottom of the barrel you cant even get raid gear.
---
Thanks :)
---
To further elaborate, the Warlock will lifetap way below 50% even as far as 10% health. They tend to use cannibalize (undead racial) which is nice but I don't understand why they refuse to drink. When heals are cast, they just disappear immediately! It's a little frustrating and I just wanted some clarification. 
---
It seems like the priest mana conversion into warlock mana is multiplied by healing. I don't like healing too long after a pull when I should be drinking. You never know what can happen on the next pull, ya know?
---
Paladins are awesome.
---
Great dungeon tanks, great raid heals, great hybrid specs for pvp
---
BUT to be fair all my guild paladins have finkles now and we've been dominating some wpvp lol
---
I'm just one person, but I may stop playing after this. Again. I'm just 15$/mo though.
---
Yeah. Normal lasher farm. They don't have an increased chance but you just kill so many that epics are more common there.
---
What tabard is that?
---
&gt;Can someone explain how this works? 
---
The tribute run works by skipping all the bosses except for the last one, Hunters kill the Ogre King and are given the full tribute.
---
Since the tribute is treated as a regular chest, it's no different to any other chest located in the instance. You don't need to be there when it 'drops', and you can even loot from it if there's something like "Master Loot" set because it's treated as a chest.
---
So basically you don't even need to be in the party or instance when it drops, but you need to be in the party to access the instance and then loot the tribute.
---
&gt;Where do I go to find this service? 
---
Advertise in LFG, or do /who 60 hunter in DM and start PMing them to see if they are willing to sell loot from their runs.
---
Horde
---
No one cares about your shitty streamer drama
---
Never underestimate the creepiness of reddit.
---
My guess is the guy had an alt with his name already on the new server so a transfer triggers a name change. At least that's what someone who planned this out would do. Still this guy deserves to be fisted in an uncomfortable manner. Maybe try finding him in other server discord to figure out what server he landed on and go from there.
---
Yup, happened with our raid too. It's great seeing the progression
---
* 3 weeks ago: 2 days of raiding. Day 1 get to Rag: wipe wipe wipe. Day 2: wipe once then first Rag kill
---
* 2weeks ago: almost wipe, clear with ~5 ppl alive (I anhked even)
---
* 1 week ago: clear rag with only a few deaths
---
* this week: kill rag before submerge

FanFuckingTastic, I hope he stays on Retail where he belongs.
---
 Not much left to do on classic? You mean nothing left to STEAL/Ninja and Beg for through out every inch of Content? Yeah for once your probably right.
---
Was doing Gnomeregan the other day and the Gizmotronic Megachopper dropped (14 STR, 5 AGI, BOE). 3 out of 5 of the party greeds instantly  because it was just going to be sold, hence the greed. I’ve seen ninjas way to much over the past couple months so I always wait until everyone rolls and then I roll according to how they roll. So anyways, our Hunter decides to need on it. I’m a prot warrior BTW so I don’t really need it but it annoyed me and I needed too. I won but here is the really annoying part. 5 minutes later, a green axe with 12 AGI drops off of trash. The Hunter greeds. SMH.
---
Unfortunately in phase 3, dalrends can be considered BIS for hunters with two +15 agility enchants.
---
I'm personally gonna stick with barbarous blade, that's just what I've heard as a defence for some hunters needing on it
---
Flat increases to your chance (to hit, to crit, etc) are additive,  not multiplicative.  So increasing your chance by 1% does exactly that.
---
Honestly man, don't listen to the posters shouting "YoU cAn'T tRuSt ANyoNe, NoT eVeN YoUrSeLf"

It sounds like you had some rapport with him, previous business dealing, and he used to that screw you out of mats. These people just want to blame you for what happened.
---
Lol this is Noblepally btw  😬
---
What these people aren't telling you is that you have to turn on scrolling battle text so you can easily see all the separate instances of "immune". Default UI just shows you on top of your character portrait, if i'm not mistaken.
---
small flame sacs were at 4.5g/ea last night on Incendius
---
I wonder if just being as popular as they are can make getting "stalked" 24/7 on the type of PvP server they play on annoying.
---
It has perks, yeah, like Asmongold getting funded things. But I wonder if sometimes it's more fun to just be "another guy" rather than someone people are messaging 24/7, doing dumb shit to be in the camera on stream, trying to find you out in the world 24/7.
---
Soda would play private servers before Classic and not stream it just so he could play Vanilla WoW and maybe on those servers he got to be "just another guy" a lot of the time.
---
They do have threat increaser. They are called Earth Shock and Rockbiter. Doesnt mean they are good tanks though xD
---
Good, the guys a toxic balding neckbeard mouth breather, he’s the one who causes the drama and he’s the one who flames the fires when he sees it. The WoW community will only gain from his loss.
---
Clearly yours didn't work.
---
What worked for me, was go to setting on login screen. And Advanced system. Check Max Foreground and background fps, and set it to something reasonable like 80fps or something. My pc tried to run the game at 600 fps+ and my GPU got super overheated and did exactly what u are talking about.
---
Try it  and let me know if u haven't found a fix
---
You made this?
---
I made this.
---
I think I have that turned on, but there's such a fuckton of immunes I honestly can't tell what the best time to break it is

Lol well the first 300 of these posts didn't work so here's hoping your 301st works. man i wish mods would just start banning people over this stuff.

Private servers install 3rd party software to mine crypto currency? Did I miss something?
---
According to wowhead - 640g but this was also during the time where there were multiple riding skills (100 and 175? for epic I think) so a definite possibility that isnt correct.  We wont know for sure until AV drops Dec 10.

I just keep it in my bags at all times so I don't have to worry about forgetting it. Same with nef cloak and the bug mount for AQ40.

Hammer of the northern wind and hurricane as well.

Im on the same boat brother, introduced my gf to the game (was’nt easy :D) and it breaks my damn heart to watch her getting nonstop ganked on the other screen. Oh, why did we chose to play on a pvp server.

Meanwhile, last night, I was running some quests in BRD to finishing dinging my alt warrior to 60. I think it was the second time I did arena. Yup, I got my savage glads chest. My main raider warrior guildies fucking hate me now.
---
&gt;Though I’d think that’d leave me with the glowing hand to select someone.
---
Did it spend your NS? If you have auto self cast checked in Interface &gt; Combat it's likely you just healed yourself. You look like you have it down but for anyone else reading through I like this variant for mouseover:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast Nature's Swiftness
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][] Healing Wave
---
I think it was changed sometime in WotLK to let you fly at 60 in Outland and 70 in Northrend, I know they had a BoA Cold Weather Flying book at some point.  So yeah it's been a while but for at least the first chunk of each expansion's life you wouldn't get flying until later and it worked out alright.
---
Thanks, good point.
---
you're the stupid one
---
getting loot in a raid shouldn't put you in debt to the guild, you were part of the kill
---
Game's fault you can't read lol
---
This was a part of vanilla that we all had to work around. Be mindful of the raids you join and the instances you enter and you won't have a problem.
---
Wait it's ending? I love that podcast so much, Josh is a great host
---
This happened to my group the other night in Scholomance. The Headmaster’s Charge staff dropped off the final boss. It has a &lt;0.15% drop rate. The item itself isn’t even that great. It gives Stam/Spirit and has a group buff that gives significantly less intellect than a Mage’s Arcane Intellect buff. It doesn’t give any spell power. No spell crit. No MP5. Just base stats and a dope item model. That’s it. 
---
Our party composition was myself (warrior), mage, priest, enhancement shaman, and a rogue. I had no reason to need on this staff other than the fact that it was super rare and looks badass. But god damn did I want to. I thought the mage and priest would roll need on it since they were the only two viable options to get any kind of use from the thing. But nope. Everyone greed rolled except for the fucking enhancement shaman who was using a 1h axe and warrior tank shield combo. Greedy bastard. Oh and I should mention he didn’t drop WF totem for half of the dungeon.
---
Depends on your guilds requirements. When we raided with full 40man, +healing was the way to go. Bosses just died! You didnt have to worry so much about mana. We have now split into two 20-25man raids, I now covet mp5/spirit as the fights are now much longer. 
---
No one can tell you the answer, you need to gauge it yourself :-)
---
I tank as 20/31/0 fury. This let's me stance dance just fine.  Cheaper sunder is unnecessary. I do miss the stun and shield bash and lower taunt cd.

I'm curious to know what's going through your head when you say shit like this

Do you play on Gehennas Horde?

Happened to me today as well at 8PM. Real bummer...
---
I played Vanilla Wow at launch and now teach high school. I play classic super casual because of life, but have a few students who started classic at launch and it has been fun to talk to them about it and give OG tips and blow their minds. Any way I say this because talking to them today they have stopped playing because they can't do anything when they log. They are stuck in their capital cities and get insta killed when they log in. Makes me bummed that possible life long players wont make it past phase 2 because of the ridiculous server imbalance. Anything to fix it is good imo.

I'll gonna take a guess that on Icyveins, the 1agi = ~2.5 ap is a comparison that includes the crit from Agi.

2 Druids (Tank + DPS)  
---
Paladin Heals  
---
Rogue/Warrior DPS  
---
Having a DPS druid can that can swap out heals when the pally was OOM/swamped was really nice, and since it was only the paladin using mana, we were pushing through relatively quickly.
---
Sucked for leather drops, but it was a surprisingly effective group.
---
Uhhh....go ahead and try it yourself, you won't pull aggro. I literally just did it to make sure.
---
Well depends how much mana you have. On my mage I have like 6200 and you should be fine with a mana ruby. But if you are dying before you can even get the nova off then its probably a good idea to use the mana shield so you can at least live.
---
You could use mana shield on top of ice barrier. And for me personally I have 2 pieces of Magister's and Dreadmist each for an extra 400 armor. Helps out for stuff like that.
---

People on mounts sure, but I see people at 100+ yards all the time. Fast moving characters often do load later for sure though.
---
I took a break here and there during that era, so iit might have been I came back when they let you fly in Outland at 60. I definitely wasn't having to walk everywhere, because I recall early on being in a group with one guy who couldn't fly. We got down to business way before he even showed up and then had stick around so he could catch up on burning enough catapults and stuff.

That was the point. Reading is helpful.

just transfer to a different server
---
Are they not very reputable? Between there and wowhead that's pretty much where I'm getting all my info since I've retained very little of it.
---
&gt;  I'm sorry but I can't say I agree with someone that says &lt;30 minute queues (keep in mind, this is additional- for a server like Faerlina, this is just added or subtracted depending on which side you're on) for an overpopulated faction are worse than a 75:25 ratio.
---
I didn’t say that so I’m not sure why you’re apologizing.
---
I think telling people they can’t play is worse then people being able to play and having a bad time. 
---
If people are arguing for 60% faction cap, and you admit you are on a 60:40 server and it is unpleasant. How do you suggest that it will help when you’re literally saying it’s bad. Using your experience it would suggest only 50% is acceptable.

You can solotank ony if you're doing it at like 19 ppl and every cast and healer get fireballed.  
---
If not, use 2+ tanks.   
---
Also you can ask your furys to use Reclkessness at the start of P3. She doesn't do much damage, a fury can tank her during P3
---
Before you transfer you make an alt with the name of the character on another server. When you transfer it forces you to change your name. My guess is that is what the scammer did. Besides that it's a dbag move and something Blizz Cs used to handle there is no way this should be condoned or allowed even using game mechanics.

---
Unless it’s an orc they would never move, and honestly in this world of full talent points I would just avoid orc warriors.
---
Sigmund Freud would have something to add here..
---
I'm glad to see these idiotic comments are being down voted now, you are not witty nor original.
---
Not that pvp trinkets are out I think it's better to swap for vw if you can since I believe their trinket hits charm effects
---
Get off my lawn.
---
Because the vast majority of players on pvp servers (you know, the players that actually want to pvp) are horde. This is Clearly evidenced by the countless horde-dominant servers in contrast to the 2 alliance-dominant servers. It's not rocket surgery.
---
Spy has advanced substantially as an addon since it’s humble beginnings.
---
Thought this was running the new style of not getting locked till you entered combat with or killed a boss? :/ Ive ran into others mcs, and onys without getting locked
---
Well up until the 12th apparently it did. We used it to drop guard aggro in SS religiously. Regardless the Cloak can be used in combat, when Invis pots cannot. **That is my point.** You can use the Cloak to escape in pvp long enough for the combat flag to drop, allowing you to swap items. 
---
None of this functionality will work in the middle of a scrim with Invis Pots, so despite your arguing, there's a *huge* difference in advantage. The PvE side has been nerfed it seems however.
---
&gt; It’s doesn’t work if the warlock is in the instance. 
---
Ah, I was under the impression that it did from the post. Re-reading helped. Thank you.
---
Human if we only include Classic.
---
Worgen if we include retail.
---
You had a cell phone?  I was still stuck using the landline
---
Depends on what guild you are in a top guild will obviously discourage that behaviour because it simply isn't optimal most more casual (as in we just clear mc each weak it doesn't really matter) won't care too much as long as more active players aren't left out
---
Wow man, better do a split from all the trash loot afterwards too because we all helped get it.  If I was in your guild I’d troll your ass until you were back salting roads with your tears.
---
Is raid logging an addon? I think you are hard core to log raid data and analyze it.
---
If too many of one faction are signed in, the rest will have a queue until people log out.  The queue itself would balance the ratio. People who are sick of the queue can transfer off somewhere else where the alliance ratio needs help.
---
Blizzard now isnt the same people who created flying mounts or pre-flying so how tf could they regret it ..
---
Use it vs Priest/Shaman, one more buff they need to purge. R1 (if available, don't know warlock stuff) if possible.
---
No but you can sell the higher level fish
---
Nah I feel you, I was just curious if it was the same group.  I was the mage by the way :)
---
They are immediately punishing. A single DK won’t do much, but it will still drop your rank progress immediately by 5-10% I believe.
---
Just run the deep prot build. During onyxia just have your other tank just chill in the middle of the pack on threat. She wipes down the aggro list with her fireballs so they can just park themselves to the point where she lands he's already picking her up. 
---
Your 'heavy threat builds' had nothing to do with onyxia. It was the strat you were using. If you have a paladin or druid who also tank, they can also just do some shenanigans to get a bunch of threat when she is in the air to pick her up as well.
---
I really despise Blizzard's "Lol this is Classic bro" response to tickets.
---
Raid loggers are less likely to come to raid prepared. It is a red flag that they are not as committed to the game as another player might be, and so it is a more dangerous investment on the raid's part to give them gear.
---
If you do not want to invest the time every week to farm consumables and the best out-of-raid gear, then that's perfectly fine. But don't go congratulating yourself and expecting ingame rewards like raid spots for not playing the game.
---
I have also been having a great time.
---
If hit is better than crit ('because the hits can also turn to crits') then why is backhands breadth (2% crit) considered rogue BiS instead of royal seal of eldre thelas (2% hit)
---
&gt; Am i so far behind the other ppl 
---
No, there are plenty of guilds recruiting for 2nd raid groups (on my server) and MC is going to be ran well into phase 4-5. Not like you'll be missing out anytime soon. If anything you will have an easier time getting geared in raids cause some people will have many pieces already.
---
&gt;  i’m worried that i will be farmed 
---
My alt is on a PvP server and Fri/Sat/Sun I lvled from 30-40 through STV and a couple other areas. I had the occasional PvP interaction with people around my level, but was never killed by someone that was ?? to me. So i'd say just get to lvling. Once BGs are released on the 10th then hopefully the level 48+ range will cool off a bit in terms of ganking.
---
No target or self cast gives a glowing hand for me. Let me know if you're able to figure out the issue.
---
But then everyone bitches that you didn't give them wisdom...
---
People are going bananas over this!
---
TSM isn’t a bot and doesn’t run scripts, but I do think it’s broken and shouldn’t be allowed.  The player is required to input keystrokes (commonly mouse scroll wheel because it’s easily spamable) to refresh the listings which are sorted by an algorithm to show auctions listed well below the assumed value. Its scummy and the people who use it know it. 
---
All blizzard needs to do is put a 5 minute delay before a listed auction actually gets posted. No annoying “are you sure?” Dialogues to deal with and you can double check your stuff if you refuse to use a community-friendly AH addon.
---
you're missing all the mitigation talents in prot and the extra threat produced in defensive stance with this build, which is a big problem in raids
---
Yeah that's not true. A very lucky boomkin might match a mage for a short while but in this phase they are screwed by RNG due to 2% max spell hit.
---
lol yes
---
Arms beat fury in pvp so the never good statement is invalid.
---
\\[T]/
---
He shouldn't have written that because it's incorrect. Blizzard never reinstates scammed materials--it has nothing to do with it being done in Classic.
---
The Forsaken are not the Orcs. Forsaken are pretty clearly evil and deserve all to be wiped out for their crimes.
---
Taurens and Trolls are chill. Orcs are basically 50/50 chill and bloodlusty.
---
There was an impromptu fight club last night in  Silithus on Esfands stream with Horde. 
---
That's how we communicated a duel, /point and the other would /nod, and give a /ready or /wait if they had cooldowns
---
In shadowlands flying mount should be level 60 for all content.
---
I don’t either, but if you like to play in the kitchen you’ll be fine! As a heads up, I had to add more water than the flakey pie dough recipe called for in order to get a good consistency.
---
Shield slam is better than 2 sunders fyi and scales(poorly).
---
They are spamming cleave on singletarget because cleave generate much less threat.
---
Holy shit, I'd be destroyed if something like this happened to me. That much gold takes a LONG ASS TIME to farm.
---
In your world, either you play 3 hours a WEEK (raid log) or play 8-13 hours a DAY (non-raid log)
---
Hm ok.
---
he means people who only log into the game to raid, and then log out when raid is over.
---
You mean Track Hidden, where the description starts with "Increases stealth detection"?
---
Exactly my guild loans out up to 500g to guildies for help with BiS items if needed. Of course theres only so many loans they can do but the idea is to build a community. Now a lot of these guys were former 39 twinks back in the day so they know each other.
---
I think you'll find most people agree with you, but the way you phrased your initial objection made you sound (to me) like you were flabbergasted that people were trading BFA gold for Classic gold 1 to 1.  This follow up comment gave the context I needed to figure out what you meant.
---
Grid2 already uses it so you don't have to install it manually.
---
Crusader will proc independently if you have it on both weapons, it's absolutely Savage.
---
Put on your robe and wizard hat before unsheathing ;-)
---
-- Long text ahead, sorry in advance , no tldr tho :P -- 
---
Yes you are, but if this is really annoying you and taking away your fun in the product it is objectively the best way to go.
---
You don't have to deal with anything that you don't like. Turn away and find something else. Others might do the same.
---
After all it is just a game.
---
Afterthought: Who am I to tell you this, I have literally spend years /played in this, I'll probably never truly stop and it just feels like more than a game at this point.
---
I am still canceling my sub from time to time to take a break when I'm not happy with the state of the game. I stopped playing half way through Cata, WoD &amp; Legion, Didn't play MoP more than maybe a month and BFA had me for maybe 4 months before I stopped and just.. didnt play anything until Classic launched.
---
You say you' re only 15$/month, but I say everytime I was unhappy enough to cancel my retail sub it coincided with the largest sub losses this game had ( apart from MoP).
---
And they sure af felt those.
---
You were the ass that first so I gave it back doesn't mean I'm taking the game serious. Myself like many others want to play PvP without super imbalance, and that's why we're staying instead of leaving. If players just left like you and others keep saying you'd have servers with almost no opposing faction. Which means that server is kind of screwed once AQ is out and both factions need to complete pre-reqs.
---
Mage is pure wrong too. No frozen wrath set listed. Freezing band is never bis, if you want to run frozen wrath set and freezing band your gonna run into trouble at ragnaros where you have 0 mana where the alternative rings give a lot of int and stam and similar sp so you can actually finish the fight.
---
Did UBRS last night with the following group:
---
  * Prot war - me
---
  * Feral tank
---
  * 3x Fury War
---
  * 2x Resto shaman (one windfury totem per group)
---
  * warlock
---
  * 2x rogue (1 combat 1 subtlety)
---
We full cleared in under an hour and spent the entire time laughing.  We run UBRS with similar comps frequently since so many of our melee still need things from there (relatively casual guild in terms of leveling/gearing pace).
---
Id rather have people active in my guild or else its boring, and id rather have guild runs than pug dungeons
---
Is crusader able to go on an item that low of level?
---
They would have the orc racial built in, essentially.
---
15% stun resist in prot, piles more armor and defense, self heal and multiple stuns, etc.
---
One stun resist into conc and its 100% over, or they could just trink at the right time.
---
Sorry that you experienced that. The customer support rep explaining to you that the items won't be returned because the scam happened in Classic was incorrect.
---
Blizzard's position has \*always\* been that the scammer is punished, the items are removed from the scammer, but \*not\* returned to the victim.
---
The one who told you if the scam was verified would result in certain punishment went a little over the line since they don't usually divulge even that so it sounds like the GM was being sensitive and at least giving you an idea that the scammer was at least going to get hammered.
---
Karma doesn't reach out to these people fast enough, their own corruption lands them exactly where they deserve and need to be, so fuck him. I'm sorry this happened to you man, i hope your guildies can come together and help you with crafting another one in whatever way possible.
---
I think only a person arguing in extreme bad faith wouldn't recognize that we are talking about PVE.
---
You're telling me defiance is better than deep wounds+impale basically... Those are the things you'd put your 20 points towards.
---
I don't see it.  20 points in prot is trolling.. go deep or don't go at all.
---
This is an accurate description of my feelings.
---
When you need gold
---
Dragonfang is a nice little dead server.
---
Bad dps yeh, but imagine the tools in pvp. With all those talents, you are a beast on every form and can heal a ton.
---
Druids are universally known as a pain in the ass to 1v1 because of all their tricks, hard to master but when you do, wow.
---
You are coming back, don't give away your gold, you will regret it later.
---
🍌
---
 🙌
---
If anyone has annoyed you or wronged you, spend all of your money on useless grey items....or cheese. Hell, send cheese to everyone in the mail.
---
One of our best healers is a raid logger. He has not logged into the game since Tuesday. He'll be on 10 minutes before raid time tonight as usual, and disappear as soon as it's over. I don't see a problem as long as he performs well. 
---
Only annoying thing is that he's the only one in guild who can make Hide of the Wild and ppl get mad he's never on to craft it lol
---
After they add a Raid ID warning, maybe they could add guild banks, ranked BGs, and Eye of the Storm.
---
4k is gonna be way to low. more like 6k mana at least and probably 3k health buffed or you'll also just die to quickly sometimes
---
mone slicing hatches x2 + 15 agi is insane too tbh.
---
You can sell the low ones, too. Blackmouth and Deviate Fish sell very decently.
---
It just depends on what you want to do with your skill, and why you want high level fishing. If you can't step into a contested zone right now, but still want to fish, you can.
---
I have tailoring herb on my main mage. I have enchant and alch on my alt. It all fits perfect together.
---
Indeed, you will have cooking at 300 way before your fishing is even remotely close to 250 hehe.
---
&gt;raid content in classic is easy enough that you do not need full tank mitigation BiS for MC
---
It's true, I'm our MT and literally have received the least pieces, cause I don't give a fawk. The entire guild has pretty much told me I could take whatever I want(I'm also the Mlooter/raid leader). The problem is that... I just don't need the gear. I literally have gotten two drops that I /rolled against the other warriors for and took some cores to make one piece of fr gear to hit cap. That's.. literally it rofl.
---
5 hunters is a hoot
---
Actually thats not a bad idea.. so far most of the solutions have been pretty garbage, but one sided faction swapping wouldnt be too bad
---
Happens more than one would think x)
---
I have similar problems I experience random lags from 5-20 seconds and sometimes even full disconnects. I have a cable connection to my router so no WiFi, 400 Mbits and 17 ping. Wow is the only game where I experience this kind of stuff. It's not as often as you describe but as a healer it feels really bad.
---
As a druid I went straight for the Bis stuff, tons of +healing, almost no int and litteraly less then 20 mp5. I ended up at about 600 +healing. What a shit show lol... Don't do that...
---
Try and create a balance in your gear. It will also vary from fight to fight what is needed. Some fight will need you to dispel a ton, some fight will need you to heal and some fight its both. It also depends a ton on your raid composition. Do you have alot of other Healers who have full mana at the end of the fight? If so, you can lean back and heal a bit less, so others can burn mana and you can regen mana.
---
This reminds me of the meatman, some people just do weird things in videogames.
---
[source](https://youtu.be/tN3SbfRYOYQ)
---
Exactly
---
Here are some quick tips; I have over 100 kills of first boss and still die sometimes, but there are steps you can take to minimize the possibility.
---
1. Stack Ice Barrier and Mana Shield for maximum protection
---
2. When choosing a spot on the ledge, look at the bush close to the corner, there should be markings(darker color) like this on the actual ledge(when standing on ledge facing bush)  / ' /. Try to stand at the '.
---
3. Foot position - You want to be close to the edge of the ledge, but not so close that you dont gain forward momentum when you run off. I find it best to quickly hit w so I inch forward until toes are in line with the edge. If you see you character lower in height you have gone too far forward, back off some.
---
4. Breaking barrier - Others have mentioned, watch for huge clumps of Immunes in the combat text and attempt to click off the block while spamming nova right after they pass. Honestly, most of the time i just let mine fall off and it works out. Your mileage might vary on this one.
---
Closing thoughts -  the dogs are the hardest part of the farm by far and you will get the hang of it after doing it enough I promise. Dying and the run back to your body sucks but hang in there! You will get to the point where it becomes muscle memory and be able to tell if you are safe on the ledge or not just by looking.
---
Thank you very much again. I’ll do that and also look and what else I can use this addon for to improve my gameplay
---
Asumí por los senos .....
---
Hello! We have actually merged with a different guild. All of us had way too much stuff irl to raid lead. Lucky for us we were picked up by a phenomenal group of folks. I'll let them know of what you have going on though.
---
Good list, to add: Gnomish Cloaking Device.
---
I know... but your comment could also be asked like “oh, what item are you referring to? What item is better in aq?”
---
And I reply tier 2.5 chest
---
It would be about 40 percent, and that's the only way to fix it.  A 60/40  is healthier than an 80/20 and that's still cancer
---
Feed your pet you monster
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I'd like to join a scourge faction at war with everyone
---
MALAZAA THE HOLY, DWELLER OF BASEMENTS
---
I thought the same as you at first lol, but he isnt talking about parses
---
But to answer your question, you just type /combatlog in game, and then upload the log text file to warcraftlogs and it does the magic. No addon required.
---
There is a program that will read your log file constantly though and automatically parse fights as they happen (called live logging). The only addon you might want would be one to automatically start logging when you enter a raid but it's certainly not required.
---
When I'm on the loot council, and I have to make a decision whether the guy who logs in for 3-10 hours a week and does jack shit to help guild mates or the guy who plays 5+ hours a day and has helped 6 people farm out their epic mount and actively participates in guild events, the 2nd guy is gonna get every single piece of gear he needs before the first guy. Not only does he deserve it more, he will also have more use of it as he plays more. I don't have an issue if you raidlog and actually show up to every raid, however you should not at all feel like you deserve loot over others who put in 10 or 20 times your effort and are an essential part of the guilds' community. Know that as a raidlogger, you are the most replaceable player on the team, so a near flawless attendence is a must.
---
Wait people dont just assign interupts and aoe the adds down in 20 seconds?
---
I’m having a great time leveling cooking and fishing to 300 because trying to do anything else right now results in failure.
---
The trick is never sleeping!
---
Soraka???
---
For PvP maybe. Aurastone gives more healing.
---
Hard to use a SS when you’re getting camped
---
Warlock, shaman, hunter, rogue, mage
---
Works super well. Rogue or mage can be swapped for arms war
---
I like it because it has so little inherent meaning that you can make the target read meaning into it in any situation.
---
Yeah or alternatively I can type out "/startattack" once, click save, and have 100% of the start attack macros I need for every character I ever play
---
I mean... just ping him on discord. Hey guy, can you get on for 5 minutes to craft that cloak for me thanks.
---
&gt;What the fuck does him pointing out that they complain to do with him playing on the same server? Nothing!
---
What are you talking about? Lol. Why would you choose the streamer server if you don't enjoy streamers? I don't understand
---
https://www.chesder.com/classic.html
---
That might be useful to you
---
Where do the consumables and world buffs come from, then, I wonder. 
---
Raid logging isn't sustainable. If what they're doing is sustainable (they farm enough mats or gold each week to sustain using them in raid), then what they're doing isnt raid logging, and I have no problem with it. Raid logging is the extreme form, where they log on right before raid, log off right after raid, and don't get on for the rest of the week.
---
Ok, should I even ask why?
---
Loot council is cancer.
---
Just stick to lashers and herbing. 
---
I make plenty per day to cover raiding and raid consumers along with financing alts.
---
&gt;What are the most economically viable Enchantments I can get for my gear if I'll be replacing them?
---
Minor speed increase on boots. Doesnt matter if youre lvl 45 walking around on lvl 25 boots
---
Naww look at you finding meaning in your existence. I'm proud of you.
---
One shotting is a massive over exaggeration considering it's a big combo of multiple clickies and attacks, but still insane nonetheless.
---
You only need like 4% to cap on a Hunter tho there's a lot of easier ways to get that
---
if what he posts online can be taken as serious he's going back to retail because apparently when people just give you everything for free it leads to a lack of content in classic.
---
I used to run around naked as part of my character in the beginning until I found my look :) the gear I have on in the video I only use for exploring so I never worry about repairing it.
---
With discord and whatnot it shouldn’t be that hard to get ahold of someone this day and age as it would have been in original vanilla.
---
Watashi no kawaii Doppio...
---
Ah Taran Icebreaker. My first and only epic in classic after like 150 lasher runs.
---
not according to https://classicwow.live/guides/390/hunter-1-12-master-theorycraft-spreadsheet, though
---
so it seems other websites say other stuff
---
Running SM 14 years ago and our tank had to leave because his mom wanted him to “massage her feet”.
---
yes there will be, and there will be a much larger number of horde queuing which is why they will have queue times.
---
Editted my comment, I see a price from the quartermaster himself listed as 640 but the guide lists it as 10.  So long story short, I have no idea lol
---
Are you using UBRS buff on your tries?
---
How many more months are we going to hear this "It'll be different in a month or two once the casuals catch up!" shit. 
---
I swear Sunwell will drop and people will still be like "Well them casuals are just catching up now!"
---
Someone posting literally the same post as 300 people isn't having a "constructive discussion" they're whining and want to be sated. I think you missed the point of reddit by a mile.
---
Crazy on my mage I am stoked as hell to have a pally tank and I would always choose less threat over 1 extra cast each pull.
---
Yup. You're just officially weeded out. Which is fine and healthy to take a break. It amazed me how many people actually said on this reddit last month, "Yeah I'm shooting for rank 14".
---
But what do I do for the other 59 minutes and 50 seconds?
---
So grossly incandescent!
---
Try joining a guild
---
You aren't stopping him from spotting the boss, he can stand in ghost form next to the spawn, for ever. Funny he didn't realize this. 
---
Keep doing it mate. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
so you can summon yourself inside MC, hearth, then accept it ?
---
You're being a troll but I'll humor you
---
The post asks 'whats the most self centered, entitled thing you've seen or heard being done in classic so far'
---
It doesny ask about if the person is annoyed or not by it, or if they play on the same server as it or not.
---
The question simply asks what things have you seen that follow those criteria.
---
Streamers based on the description the guy gave literally fits it to a T and he pointed that out, which is what the thread is asking for.
---
You're either being disengenuous with your arguments (troll)
---
Or you're a colossal fucking idiot.
---
That is essentially what faction based queue would be in my mind. It would flag players’ faction for the specific servers and would let people in from the minority faction first to keep a healthy balance.
---
But in this system it would be less hopeless imo.
---
you're missing the bigger picture, in a kind of hardcore guild people won't just need you to do 3 craft during the week.
---
6/10, name does not contain banana.
---
I focused almost entirely on ret talents up until about level 30. The grind was also quite smooth up until that point. Once I was healing for some dungeons I worked in a bit more holy, but if you are planning on questing solo, staying focused on holy will really feel like a slog.
---
Once you are closer to 60, respec and get follow a more traditional holy build is my suggestion.
---
To be fair I don't think there was ever a point during which a GM would have unlocked you from a raid.
---
Haha good luck trying to get into a premade as shadow.
---
You're chill man just don't keep getting em
---
Ironforge.pro
---
Melee should never be getting knocked back.
---
“Hopefully you’ll recover and be able to get the helm you want” 
---
This is so condescending. Very unprofessional.
---
Pally tank means I get to use my arcane power on aoe. Berry nice.
---
Av wins will only give you 1350 honour. The problem is it can take sometimes over 30 min to win and DR for kills kick in fast (not to mention you do the BG in a group with other 39 people).
---
Also, for WG only one person can que up an entire group
---
For someone without coordinates, do you mean the southern ogres or the ones at the cave?
---
&gt;cutting edge achievement
---
This made me laugh.  Nobody gives a shit about your CE.
---
If they have enough money to buy all the mats they can craft their own item, then trade the item for your mats+fee, thats what I do when crafting for people.
---
10 minute duration so would appear so (though can’t confirm)
---
Didn't fix the problem but thank you for the info
---
I'm a warlock as well and I don't think people even know we have it lol
---
Nope, tried, doesn't seem to make you bigger. At least when using halloween candy (which also makes you bigger).
---
I dont remember BGs being cross server u till later in... is this time around different? I remember it was server vs server then eventually battlegroups were introduced.
---
lmao I read black girl
---
With 308+ weapon skill you want to get 5.5% hit chance, so effectively 6% hit. Make sure you keep your weapon skill above 308 as it improves your glancing blow damage by 45%.
---
¿¿Qué senos??
---
Don’t agility and attackpower/critchance become the primary stats that you want after reaching cap?
---
Me not that kind of orc tho
---
Yeah, itemization is terrible for us right now, 2s and 3s is where we really shine. Can't discount the "fun factor" though.
---
I think 27th november 2019 @9.38:45 PM, sorry I couldn't get more specific.
---
Didn't remembered that!
---
Might aswell gear up the healers we need later on and get them into the rhythm now! It's not like it matters if we finish mc one hour later or earlier, because raid times are raid times, we keep going to a specific time anyway.
---
Sorry for spelling issues. Auto correct screwed me and reddit wont let me see what I'm typing to you
---
We have a shaman tank in our guild who off tanks in MC and does a great job with every 5-man and UBRS.
---
Rewarding people deserving it is cancer? come on.
---
As a 57 warrior who spent last 4 levels in BRD I am happy to hear that it seems as though other dungeons are slightly easier on AE tanking. It is tough as hell, I use explosives for additional AE threat but looking forward to smaller pack sizes
---
Interesting, I honestly had no idea what they were before I saw this recipe, and since I was so clueless I just used a bunch of different local hot peppers - may not be 100% authentic but damn it if it didn’t taste great!
---
Is there any evidence to support the claim that Classic players will be here in a years time? Have they announced BC?
---
Yeah, it's quite the scummy addon.  I just looked it up and felt scummy just looking at it.  What gets me the most is the thought of that sweaty fuck of a player just sitting in front of the auction house (presumably scrolling his sticky, sweaty mousewheel) just waiting for other players to fuck up so that he can capitalize by reselling the item the other player just farmed for.  He even admitted to keeping his identity secret in an effort to ward off "angry townsfolk".  ANGRY TOWNSFOLK. He has pissed off so many people using this method that he has come up with this evil yet beautifully, loquacious way to describe the people who have fallen victim to his scam. /spit has never been so warranted.
---
Find someone to boost you in the deadmines at lvl 15. Get 2 cruel barbs and enchant both with fiery weapon, they will last you till lvl 30. Its really strong. From there get serenity blade/vanquisher sword. These will last till 47. Than trash blade.
---
Did you fish to 300 in stormwind or something?
---
You're right. Seems obvious now.
---
Bald man bad 
---
Upvote please
---
Cancer loot councils are cancer. Dkp with hoarders and players who don't know what items are good is cancer. Random rolls are cancer.
---
Good loot councils are the quickest way to get your guild the best geared. And if you don't trust your officers to run a noncorrupt loot council, then why are you raiding with them in the first place?
---
Make him some bags with your tailor, buy some greens for him every several levels if you want and can afford it, but making sure you keep your weapons up to par is most important.
---
There's plenty of blue BoE weapons you could buy or farm for him too if you don't want to grind *every* dungeon
---
Well, I'm a Druid. A good Druid can singlehandedly carry WSG and AV pretty easily if I ever want to play solo. That's one of the main reasons I play this class. 
---
But yes I do have a guild and people to rank with for the initial push.
---
by doing what i just said. they should also be stopping dots around 45% or w/e anyway.
---
Thankfully you don’t run Reddit or this sub. It seems to me you are the one whining here.
---
Today on onyxia our dps meters didn't match so yep.
---
for huntards its 2
---
Lmao its MC though. We have 5 rogues, all pvp hemo or sub daggers, in raid and we do MC in 2.5 hours and kill rag before submerge.
---
I think the only salt is you man.
---
I love the wPvP, I just wish there were less people crying about it.

My roommates once dropped a watermelon in the kitchen and it exploded all over the place. All i typed into party chat was "brb watermelon"

Please tell me this is &lt;Tel Abim Bannanna Company&gt;’s doing
---
It's not about itemization, shadow is at its strongest right now when other classes haven't stacked crit yet. Once warriors and rogues get better gear PW:S won't hold them for long, either.
---
Main-hand for SS damage. If you can get your hands on "the butcher" for a cheap price it will make your weapon progression smoother and your leveling easier. It will basically fill a gap where you normally wouldn't get a good weapon for almost 15 levels otherwise.
---
Above 308 does nothing for glancing blow damage reduction. 308 is where it’s at though.
---
1000 seems not so many. Must be like a 100 lashers at least per run. You did 10 runs?:)
---
That’s up for debate with the party. If said beforehand sure, but just automatically assuming that is no bueno.
---
Nah, MS &gt; OS. This is basic shit
---
It was immediately nerfed/fixed after Salad Bakers used it in their speed run. As far as I know,  they were the only Alliance guild to use it.
---
*The Windsor’s Frenzy buff is again properly restricted to the small area around Marshal Windsor.
---
Developers’ note: This correction restores the buff’s functionality to its original 1.12 behavior.*
---
I multibox 3 hunters. Had my brother roll a warrior to tank for me. Turns out we dont actually need a tank so now he is a dps warrior lmao.
---
And it just burnt into your memory.
---
Fair pvp seems to exist only when both parties opt in. So, PVE servers and BGs. We've all learned our lessons, I guess.
---
"you think want this but you really don't" kinda vibe
---
Oh yes, I definitely know the feel :) play the game exactly the way you want, rushing to 60 is the choice for most but farming up that mount is just as nice, if you just happen to like it. As pointed out earlier, farming arathi highlands for elemental fire/earth is a nice choice if you manage to get tags and stay alive, pickpocketing seems allright as well tho I wouldn't know since I haven't played a rogue.
---
I just did and I'm really happy with it
---
Yep, but the speed clear videos used it before it was reverted.  In some they even call it out by name and you can also clearly see the icon.
---
Mucho Grande Tetas!!
---
That spot was never a secret anyway
---
That's cool
---
You would need a raid to be able to kill one, that's for sure.
---
Well it's not very formal.
---
Must not have been a tuxedo cat.
---
&gt;I'd be a forsaken.
---
GL not being able to have kids, weirdo. 
---
I'd go gnome or dwarf. With the exception of their city going Chernolbyl on them, gnomes seem have had the least amount of difficult times. If you're human you had a 60% chance of getting murdered by undead or orcs. Dwarves are similar.
---
What dps are you topping with?
---
I am sure it's not 500+ like the fury warriors.
---
As a fellow banana crusader I approve this post
---
I basically became a raidlogger, since i am not intrested in wpvp. It's not that i am asocial tho, often i log to check stuff and i offer myself to craft stuff for free to the guild as well as chatting and occasional help around.
---
Last night the raid leader gave an alchemy recipe to another alchemist saying "it was more frequent" and i was like "ok, after all being frequent means using it more often", but if they were to pull that shit again on other stuff i'd be ready to leave them.
---
Shit, beat me by 30 minutes!
---
5x rogues. Can kill pretty much all dungeon bosses and avoid trash. Druid won't really work since you'll often have to use vanish.
---
Wtf
---
Ok thanks, def not worth it
---
 I mean it’s a game, who cares lol. Just don’t go breaking the computer over getting ganked or people despawning the mob. Grab a lock and hit Silithus, it’s the easiest demon to take down when you COR it. Take a greater shadow prot pot so you can really take him out easy.
---
I'd be ok with this if
---
1. Blizzard made it very clear that they would not involve themselves in any in-game scams.
---
2. There were no name changes or server transfers (let alone free transfers)
---
Edited for brevity.
---
You want hit% until you get to hit cap. Then you want crits. It's easy enough as rogue to stack up +%hit with your other gear, and leave a trinket slot open for that fat 2% crit.
---
Wall of text incoming, TL;DR: there's no reason for most people to roll Alliance, and that can't be fixed without changes.
---
This here.  Adding a faction queue just changes it from Alliance not being able to play due to constant ganks to Horde not being able to play because of queues.  As someone who plays both factions, neither of those sound appealing.  The real core problem (outside of the dumb as shit honor system, but that's already here so good luck doing anything about it) is that there is basically no reason to roll Alliance.  
---
Alliance have easily a worse leveling experience.  Many posts have been made about this so I'll spare the details, but the fact is that leveling as Horde is easier.
---
They have a few good racials, but they're attached to the less popular races.  For a personal example, I've been a priest main since 2005 and I would never roll an Alliance priest because I don't want to play a dwarf, and if I play anything except a dwarf I'd always know in the back of my head that my character is strictly inferior to a dwarf.  That is *awful* game design, and was a common point of contention even in vanilla.  Some extra food for thought: in Warcraft 3, night elves were basically an entire race of hunters, druids, and Illidan, yet dwarves are better hunters and Tauren are better druids.  Pretty cool race fantasy, eh?
---
Then there's paladins.  Yes, paladins are support gods, pretty much everyone acknowledges that they're the best PvP healers.  But in order to become as gods, paladins first have to level, and paladins are boring as fuck to level.  This is now meta knowledge so even people that may be interested in the class only hear "boring heal/buff bot" so they're less inclined to play it.
---
So what reasons are left to play Alliance?  They have the prettier races, but I point again to which races are actually good.  They have proximity to BRM, but try telling that to Alliance on any PvP server that that's an advantage and they'll respond with their latest 6-death trip to BRM.
---
So if you want to actually fix the problem, you have to give PvP-inclined players a reason to pick Alliance, because the ones they have right now aren't working.  The only real way of doing that is giving them better racials and maybe some more quests.  Give players a free transfer to Alliance.  Hell, one private server I played on gave Alliance dual spec.  The fact is that most avid PvPers (except some of the mega-organized groups/guilds, but they are the exception, not the rule) are tryhard meta slaves, and they will *never* roll Alliance because "Horde is better at PvP because racials" is the meta, and there is no \#nochanges fix to that.
---
Oh, and for everyone saying Horde won't have long queues for BGs because of xrealm queues, ask yourself this: do you *really* think all those Alliance who rolled on PvE servers are anxious to PvP to the extent that your Horde-infested PvP server is?
---
This trick is better for group dungeon runs than raids.
---
Well I’m 51 so nobody really wanted to test me in the lower zones. I’m able to take down some shitty 60s if I get the drop on them. Also horde, just play on a really well balanced server.
---
Everyone who needs the gear gets to roll on the gear. 
---
Loot councils end up making a bunch of guild suck-ups, and shit-talkers. I can’t even count how many times the way people talk in discord suddenly change when they know certain people have control of their gear progression in the game.
---
This is why you cant trust BIS lists unless you understand the mecahnics behind it (which it seems like you do). Know that you have the knowledge and you can be more correct over a list some rando made
---
mage can solo maraudon trash (worms and turtles) all the way from 46 to 56. sure xp per hours drops from 80k an hr to maybe 35k or something near the end but its still faster than questing. i hear you can farm lashers to 60,
---
but havent tried that myself.
---
They are trolling you. Improved expose armor fucks over warrior tank sunder. Dont do that.
---
If you want info and opinion on what you should do with your rogue, I need some guild context, then I can help you. Delete this shit show of a thread and direct message me.
---
I was able to get the Kor Gem solo as the mobs can be LoS'ed and the drop rate is pretty good.
---
For SFK, I would find some other paladins that need it and make the journey there. The Hammer is near the beginning of the instance, so you don't need to run the whole thing if you don't want.
---
This is damn awesome :D
---
Also, that's a really nice UI you got, what addons do you use?
---
I don't feel as bad as your English teacher did when they read your post.
---
Try tracking a debuff on your target. Then pick the poison name. 
---
I use this for DoTs (shadow word pain, moonfire etc). It is solid color when none present and faded with a countdown when present.
---
Also, don’t forget to tick track only yours.
---
Warriors have huge amounts of combat utility, wtf are you smoking?
---
Piles of interrupts and control via slows, stuns, ap manipulation, disarm, etc.
---
I wonder what kind of people you're fighting if they only manage to move a couple of feet in 10 minutes. Are they ressing on top of their corpse?
---
Yep, that's right and I've spent quite a bit of gold getting BoE BiS and enchants on my main spec gear so being asked to then change into one of these sub par meme specs just so gear doesn't get DE'd is a bit annoying.
---
Somebody wanted an arcanite rod the other day. Would not trade mats unless I gave him a 200g deposit. He was still looking for a crafter 2 hours later in trade chat. If somebody don’t trust me enough to give me mats I’m not making shit for them. I know there are bad people about, but what you gonna do become a lock-in in your parents basement?
---
Maybe wrong forum to ask that on....
---
This kid clearly isn't alright.
---
I'm assuming most competitive premades have been farming gear pretty hard and are in fairly good shape. I have effectively a +400 Spellpower set and a +700 healing set, which leads me to believe people with only really 1 gear set to focus on should be pretty far along as well.
---
Climb the mountain from the south side of Tanaris, walk across the top of the mountain ranges.  Bring some slowfall stuff.
---
I must have not explained this fully. I'm trying to tracks poisons on my weapons - not my target.
---
Basically if you're going hard ranking, it's a real fuck up, if you're kinda casual about it don't get to fussed about 1 DHK. Don't get more tho.

But you got further than 15 years ago

Or pay someone +2 others with the FP to summon you.
---
Crit chance is everything Agi and AP behind it. Depending on build you want 6% cap but white hits account for so much dmg
---
Yea he knows. It is the same people bro.
---
Chinese company has these "bots" leveling up grinding the same mobs over and over until 60. Then the character is usually used to farm gold. Hence the reason most, if not all, are hunters.
---
And yea usually the name is like Amdgjsbeu weirdness and the pet has a name with Chinese character. There's been one on my server for months, reported by so many people, and I saw him just the other day...level 56 now lol.
---
how ironic :D i just helped a dudu friend today getting his items from tribute run (owl spec for fun) thx btw ima try it
---
Yes, customer support is "limited" in what it can do. That's true regardless of whether it's Classic or Standard and has always been the case from the beginning. The CSR saying Classic was "unsupported" was wrong and that's also a different claim.
---
Really upset that you don't have yellow ping.
---
Crusader OH striking MH striking on MH to help increase backstab ambush and SS dmg while you have fast offhand for crusader procs
---
Try the Poisoner addon instead. It works great.
---
It's fair. You act as if you're only gonna be in a raid one or two times. If your guild is apparently active, why are we acting as if rolling on gear that people need won't eventually balance itself out either way.
---
"EARTHQUAKE"

This happened in between LOD attempts. One of our ret Paladin's from Egypt actually had to leave. Eventually came back

John deere on whitemaine just did it in 49 minutes. Dunno if there is a video yet
---
are you on Blaumauex?
---
Imo if everything goes perfectly, Horde has the potential to do a faster speed run than Alliance. The problem is how risky the gameplay is, especially in this gear phase. A Horde fury warrior can easily get a huge WF proc, rip aggro and instantly die since they are wearing 0 stamina and leather gear. 
---
Paladins are also MUCH more mana efficient than Resto Shamans. They can instantly bop someone who pulls aggro and they provide blessing of kings, which increases Alliance survivability even more. If pulls go poorly or there is some sort of aoe or cc, they can just bubble and continue safely blasting heals into everyone.
---
Our guild (Storm) is going to be working on doing some official speed runs (with everyone flasked) after Thanksgiving. Atm we are clearing normal runs in roughly 40 minutes. We have a lot of people who stream.
---
Alliance on Kromcrush. It seems that lots of people went to Heartseeker.
---
Instant memories of Baldur's Gate commences
---
The guild leader is right. Why would he give a recipe to a raid logger who won’t be on to craft the potion when people need it
---
When I played as a warrior back in the vanilla days right before BC was released I rarely ever tanked because there was usually a pally in group that everyone would insist on being tank. Yeah, it hurt my ego a bit but they are better at holding mobs.
---
It adds flat 1%.
---
You should provide an actual link so that we can jump in and express our disdain for the situation. Public outrage is starting to seem like the only way to get big companies to address situations these days.
---
Dreamstate or whatever are two guilds on youtube that speedrun MC on pservers if you are interested. They are horde

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1ogj3/wheres_my_keyring_blizzard/). 
---
At that level a hunter is fine using that necklace tbh... The int and spirit are useful stats still, especially considering your alternatives from dungeons that far are mostly Stam/spirit necklaces
---
They started this in BC. PvP elements/control are in Hellfire Peninsula, Nagrand, Terokkar Forest, and Zangarmarsh. (I can't actually recall any pvp objectives in the other zones). These all gave faction bonuses to whomever controlled the zones.
---
In WoTLK, they expanded on the idea with Winterspring. Whoever controlled the zone had access to Vault of Archavon.
---
On my server (70:30 alliance favor), horde was almost always shut out of VOA. It was a huge scramble to get anything from there.
---
It's a cool idea, but only if the servers are balanced. Everything we're seeing right now about imbalanced servers, and players being shut out of content would only be exacerbated by PvP objectives and controlling-side-only instances.
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.

Raptors wearing feather jewelry. Like, how did that even got on there, they don't have thumbs!

The cave I believe. If the blasted lands was a clock... the entrance to the zone is at twelve o clock, the alli fortress is at 2 o clock, kirith dungeon at 3 to 4 o'clock, NW ogres at 10 o clock, and the cave ogres are at like 8 to 9 o clock. There is one servant that spawns there for the quest too.
---

---
The solution to the problem wasn't titanforging. You're basically getting your BiS gear hasn't been hard since WotLK if you're in a guild consistently downing the bosses. The challenge in getting gear has moved from getting lucky with the loot to downing the bosses.
---
In vanilla (classic), you get 2 drops from most bosses in molten core, some bosses drop 3 and Ragnaros drops 4, Onyxia drops 4, 5 if you include the head. There's a total of 11 bosses and you're getting like 30 items tops divided by 40 people (which is why split runs). It's impossible to even give one item to each person.
---
In WotLK 25man heroic there was 5 items per boss. Naxxramas has 15 bosses, Sartharion has 1, Eye of Eternity has 1, that's 17 bosses. That's 85 pieces divided to 25 members. That's more than 2 pieces per member. 
---
This is a much larger source to lack of loot drama than titanforging.
---

They locked the thread after 5 minutes. I did send out a tweet to customer support twitter.
---
I joined a normal with a friend as 5/8 mythic and 448 ilvl. People were talking about it in chat as I zoned in and the invite took about .5 seconds. It doesnt matter much but people absolutely notice. Especially since you can hover over someone and [raider.io](https://raider.io) shows you their progress regardless of gear.

it does make the feelings come on heavy doesn’t it

OP is the one at the funeral

I’m having a great time as a geared PvP spec rogue
---
I just dueled our MT, and it turns out he is 32/19 (dunno why not 31/20). We clear the raids with 30-35 people. Any issues with threat is DPS zomgnuke-related, any issues with healing is down to too few healers.
---
You don’t lack gear, and therefore don’t need deep protection talents. If you want to max tps, go furytank. If you want to be able to pvp as well, go standard 31/3/17. 
---
I’d use the arms build, simply because:  1 lacking stance dancing is a real pain, and 2 I would not be MT or 2nd tank without 5/5 defiance (which you would lose with 20/31/0 as I saw suggested). 
---
Whatever the spec you will use a shield at all times in a raid and spend 98% of the time in def stance for the threat modifier (unless you are the one percent guildwise). Deep prot talents are overrated in the current phase of the game.
---
Edit: spec numbers
---
97 not even saw a dal rend MH once.
---
So I am approaching 60 on a mage (57 at the moment). I was wondering if anyone had any information or sort of checklist on things/quests/items I should focus on while I'm working my way towards 60 so that I could be better prepared to raid or pvp. Any information is helpful!
---
My first “childish” experience in today’s classic was in ZF. We were noticing the pulls were going slow, and turns out our mage was AFK half of the time. He wasn’t responding to us, so my friend who was lead kicked him. He typed in say chat “WTF WHY KICK IM TOPPING DPS LOL” and proceeded to pull more to wipe us.
---
He was in fact, fourth. Behind me, the tank.
---
I like to say my grandpa is stuck in the dishwasher

same. I remember "misremembering" seeing barrens as contested and I thought oh wow we are taking the barrens! but then i found out i was wrong... the let down was big.

It’s a great server! Happy I rolled here during launch.
---

Classic is a subpar MMO, so many exploitable mechanisms &amp; methods to grief others. It was just a matter of time a post like this appears &amp; more to come.

I wonder how big of an industry this kind of video game farming is in china.  Considering blizz seems to cater to the chinese it makes me wonder if they don't deal with this as well as they could due to some backroom pressure.  Mass banning thousands of chinese accounts wouldn't look to good for them in that respect.  Who knows..
---
One simple fix would be to not let chinese roll on na servers.. problem solved overnight.
---
My cat literally caught fire 15 years ago while I was running UBRS.

Relax dude.

Lbrs is best xp/hr dungeon so do that once ur 55 and get all the quests
---
I WON'T FUCKING RELAX. I'M SITTING HERE IN BRD WITH MY THUMB US MY OWN ASSHOLE
---
You'll have to start a new character. Maybe there are free transfer fron high population servers to new and empty servers but I can't tell. I dont know.
---
Blizzard is completely silence about wpvp and act like its all normal. I wonder how many player they lose (pissed off from ganks) compared to how much they keep (those who were bored and need something to keep on while they release other phases)
---
Have you been attacked in Ratchet before at a low lvl? The goblin guards smack the shit out of the attacker
---
if its crossrealm, wouldnt the location (server) of the character not matter? edit nevermind i misunderstood op, i agree with you**
---
I had my account compromised and restored yesterday, and they restored my loot to how it was like a week ago. The weird thing is that I had 60g yesterday, and 115 a week ago, and they let me keep the 60. So basically I made 115g off of getting hacked. Lost a few consumables and my PvP trinket but definitely came out on top. So it absolutely is possible for them to restore items. Seems absolutely insane they wont.
---
Yea, same thing happened to me once. They would have never unlocked him.
---
I definitely don't expect locks to bandage. Even during that dungeon I was thinking "damn, save your bandages and let me heal you, I have the mana". I just wanted to show an example of an extremely considerate warlock.
---
But I do expect warlocks to use level 45 consumables if there are no mages around. If there's no mage, chances are I'm using my own stocks of level 45 water inbetween pulls, which means a lock's lifetap damage is coming out of my coin purse. It's a handful of silver though, so this is the only time I've ever mentioned it.
---
You need to join the classic rogue discord and use the dps spreadsheets posted there to simulate your setup
---
This is insane. All they do is talk about community and shit and it's policies like this that make me want to deal with others as little as possible.
---
Read carefully again, that's not what i'm saying.
---
I believe the fire balls are random. I was fireballed twice in a row which should be impossible if it were purely based off of threat.
---
They definitely do wipe threat however.
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah I mean it's definitely not optimal, it's a meme spec for a reason. It's about the fun!
---
BGs are coming early. Nothing else needs to be done or said. PLEASE lets stop crying about pvp.
---
What level to start LBRS?
---
Execpt for DM west where nothing holds agro and mobs drain all your mana.
---
Spriests have this small window to steam roll. Once we get to later patches, rogues and warriors will just shred through your shield and health with crits, before spriests can really ramp their damage.
---
Should have came to heartseeker
---
By this extension you should never be able to roll then. You don't *need* it. You're logging in for 3 hours a week, and you think you need it as much as the guy using it 5 hours a day? You sound pretty hypocritical, OP.
---
it is, especially if you also give the players a way to transfer to alliance.
---
Sincerely, an Alliance warrior on a horde dominated server!
---
Huh? I play on Fairbanks, it's PvP.
---
I'd say pretty damn big because if you happen to venture to one of the gold selling sites, they offer their services for almost every game out there. Not just gold either...leveling services, fully geared characters, etc
---
Mine is “I’m shampooing my eyebrows”
---
If I found out one of my employees had spoken to a customer this way they would be seriously reprimanded. Good on you for showing as many people as you can. What if we started some kind of petition so blizz knows how serious we are about deserving support?
---
First time I saw this was mid pull on LFR Spine of Deathwing. Tank just disappeared
---
You sound like a child. 
---
"I DONT LIKE THING. YOU ALL SHOULD DO THING I LIKE INSTEAD."
---
How can we use social tools if they transfer off the server immediately for free? In vanilla there was support for things like this.
---
when a stealther is near you, you can hear the woosh sound. When that sound plays, Spy displays a box
---
Why do you move melee out?
---
Just find the three melee people with the three lowest GUIDs, stack them on the tank, and have 3 priests shield them when you would normally do the melee out call.  The rest of your melee can stay in the entire time and burn the boss straight through.
---
     /run for i=1, GetNumGroupMembers() do local token = "raid"..i local guid = UnitGUID(token) if guid and guid &lt; UnitGUID("player") then print(UnitName(token)) end end
---
That macro will spit out the GUIDs of players lower than you, so just find the three lowest DPS warriors/rogues, stack them on the tank side, priest shield before wrath, ez pz.  He will target these 3 people EVERY time with wrath.  If they die, make sure to have the 4th lowest person move the tank side ASAP.
---
Our kill with "dps out" calls:  https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/8ftBqPy9QkZ6FM3R#fight=last
---
Our kill with the "GUID/shield" strat:  https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/h7BT8c2DdrMKyHGb#fight=last
---
Also make sure your melee only do white hits during the wrath, as it's a full agro dump.  Tank needs to be on top of the taunt.
---
How the fuck???
---
I've done about 200 arena runs as well. However, I've gotten 21 kills on him. No drop so far.
---
I'm glad people are doing this. You try to have a 1v1 or 2v2 and 10 people come and 4 mages fireblast. Fuck them. Just people crying cause they can't leech in searing or burning steppes as much.
---
If I were you, I'd just equip what you find, and then check the auction house every now and then for new weapons.
---
People take this shit so seriously. I don’t know why people play when they’re not having fun!
---
&gt;It doesny ask about if the person is annoyed or not by it, or if they play on the same server as it or not.
---
He volunteered the information that he plays with streamers. If your opinion of streamers is that they're sad, or pathetic, or self centered, why would you choose to play on that server?
---
He could have just said they are, without mentioning he chose that realm. I'm making fun of someone for playing with streamers and then complaining about them. How is that trolling?
---
I'm saying that he's wrong. He says that 1% crit is like 12 spell power.. and 9 int is worth 1 spell power, so what's 9x12? 108 int = 1% crit = 12 spell power.. but in this game you actually get 1% crit for 59.5 intellect so he's not weighing stats correctly at all, even by his own standards.
---
Spy is for people without brains.
---
Changed the subject there mate.
---
What is that Scyth one of your casters is wearing? I thought the Warlock Class Quest Scyth did not come out for along time? Or is that footage from a PServer?
---
OP actually has the right idea, these are the posts blizzard listens to
---
Hmm I guess I'll need to give it another go
---
So anyway, I started blasting
---
No belt so not full t1
---
Seconded
---
This isn't about the guild.
---
These posts complaining about the complaining are worse than the original complaint.
---
Don't report that's free 500 honor everyday :p . When bg's come out report it.
---
Good thing it was LFR. I presume you were able to face roll your way to victory?

my friend's mom came in and started hitting him with a belt, after like ten minutes of this he hops back on and we're like dude what happened, are you ok? He started laughing and said he acts like it hurts or she would hit him harder

They definitely regret what it is now I reckon. Yet they worked this in beautifully in WotLK with zones like Storm Peaks and Icecrown. To a lesser extent Hyjal and Deepholm as well in Cata. Those zones have a vertical aspect that makes navigating them as engaging in 3 dimensions as any zone is in 2. 
---
Then they just threw that out the window in later expansions in favour of the pathfinder system, which I think is lazy, un-RPG friendly, and a waste of good level design. I really think Blizzard's good game sense died with Wrath, as the rest of the zones are just uninspired. The art team are killing it as they always do, every zone in the modern game looks stunning, but there's never any thought put into level design anymore. Just pretty art assets packed densely into a flat plane (I'm looking at you Val'Sharah)

BRB gotta vacuum my fridge
---
If any horde says that they are simply stupid af. I play horde, and it's simply not fun. You run around and don't find alliance. There's one alliance group every now and then, but they always get swarmed by countless horde as soon as they pop up. Every zone you see horde everywhere.
---
This bullshit will destroy the game, it at least made me stop doing PvP already. BGs will probably have queues too long to play too.
---
We need faction based queues AND free transfers from horde to alliance. I don't get why the latter isn't at least available.
---

---
his rambling about LC is pretty strange. And i'm not a LC member shilling since we mostly roll with dkp, but when deciding things like rare epic deciding who has prio pretty fairly seems like healthy behavior. We did LC the benedictions for exemple and people mostly found the distribution fair based on who invested himself to progress his character.
---
&gt; If you were to even impose a 50:50 hard cap faction limit on a 60:40 server, there would not be bad queues AT ALL for either side.
---
You don’t have the numbers to say that. Also, I’m not sure why you add “either side” of course the side with less people would have no queues.
---
I really don’t think a dynamic cap works. You already said that 60:40 is borderline unplayable . Why would this be acceptable if it’s already not acceptable now? That makes no sense.
---
Seems about right..Many servers are balanced but alliance crying
---
Oof, just reading these replies you can tell your a sub-optimal player who logs in rarely, probably parses poorly, and yet expects gear. Big YIKES for me on this one
---
Look up pre raid bis item lists. They usually tell you where to get them. You can definitely get started farming them now
---
Fuck off nerd, it's not an exploit.
---
just wait until they start wearing tier 2 :)
---
You should have vanished before you pulled. Vanish is a dps cd for you in your current situation.
---
Blizzard sitting over there like:
---
"We said we're releasing it with the first "major patch". Oh btw phases aren't patches, and hotfixes aren't either. Loooooooooool"
---
Donkey Kong bongos or bust!
---
It lets you reset the instance without having to run back to the beginning/outside. Once you log back in you are teleported right outside the instance
---
people really trying to bring factions into every post, don't they? if you don't like it, ignore it, if you like it, embrace it. but wtf has horde vs alliance to do with this post
---
To the people saying Blizzard would never do anything about this, that is simply not true, as I've had this exact scenario happen for me on retail in MoP. I had the mats for the Sapphire Panther and someone was posting in trade chat that they were crafting for free. I arranged the trade and traded them the mats and they instantly logged off. I submitted a GM ticked and got the mats returned a few days later. As far as I could tell, the character didn't exist anymore so I'm pretty sure he changed server aswell.
---
Are you talking about calculating avoidance?
---
I was a Horde questing in STV when I saw an alliance fighting Bagheera solo, remembering how hard he was for me, I jumped in and started helping him out. 
---
Just in time for 5 alliance skulls to come by and kill me.
---
When was Classic relaunched?
---
The average price is 1s 25c for 5, so a stack comes out to be 5s. The total would come out to be around 4 gold for all of that.
---
Its a meme sec in raids, not PvP.
---
I remember my first time playing wow
---
Great alternative to Krol Blade
---
&gt;"immoral to lock people out of their characters/servers when they are paying a monthly fee to play the game" youre kidding right? they do this now with queues, like right now, and have been since forever.
---
No, faction queue is much more severe than server queue. It means that if the server is 20/80 essentally 4/5 of the horde players won't be able to play, at all. They will be stuck in never ending ques  until a huge influx of alliance players join (which is unlikely, especally if there is no free faction change available).
---
It will create faction balance, sure. But at the cost of choking the server to death.
---
Its been tried  on private servers multiple times, and its a disaster everytime. Especally if its done retroactively
---
I don't think Blizzard will ever take that path, and I don't think they should.
---
It was not in the "initial deal", if you picked the highest pop realm possible, then a queue is to be expected. But even if you are on the lowest pop realm  available, and faction is enforced, you will still get a huge queue. If it was implemented initially OR on brand new server which has that system advertised, then maybe they could get away with it.
---
I once had to afk because the police was inside my house, shouting in the hallway. I apparently had a break-in while gaming, and some lady called the police while they were fiddling with the windows to get inside.
---
Any raid group that isn't hardcore pushing server first/fastest doesn't need you to change to fury/prot. 
---
If dps are pulling too much threat, tell them to back off on the dps. Let you build your threat, problem solved. 
---
They should all be using threat meters and backing off way before they start to reach your threat anyway.
---
I’ve started cooking and sending the vendor fish to my lock. Life tap to 0 —&gt; wet da fish. It tastes better than mage water too!

Edit: Autocorrect..... y u do dis? I guess I’ll keep it as is lol
---
Hit cap is about 8.6% with no special weapon skills
---
You can’t give people a way to transfer one faction to another. Horde has shamans and alliance has pallys. They can’t transfer. This would split guilds and play groups. Which is not something people want.
---
You can’t just say “it is” the answer and not provide an argument. Downvote me all you want, at least I’m backing up what I’m saying.
---
It's definitely not meme in 1v1/2v2/3v3. And it has actual PVE uses unlike ret or boomkin.

My go to in vanilla when I wanted someone to leave but wasn’t able to remove them: “brb McDonald’s”

Really sorry this happened. I don't understand people - is breaking all ties, moving servers, changing names, etc worth 700g? He could make that much in several  lionheart helm commissions. What a piece of shit.
---
İ am just wondering how much hit rate i have since i need to reach %9. İt is for not missing hits in bosses.
---
Cheap shot from max range while facing the target sideways so you can strafe / turn away quick. You should be able to make a cheap shot + stopattack macro too.
---
One of my guild mates from wrath would say "my dog just exploded"

It is indeed so. But alas....players are so much used to it now....:(

---
Just wanted to say I've read your comments on this chain and agree with everything you've mentioned 100%. Maybe it's cause I used to play back in vanilla, or from my time being scammed in other games like runescape, but people here seem to have this weird entitled attitude
---
Hey man, dont devalue the importance of a clean refrigerator.
---
So basically having a pug instead of me, that provides the same about of presence in the raid but does not return for future raids still can ask for items rolled for it, despite having less guild presence than me? and that would benefit more the guild?
---
Or you say pugs should ever be able to roll on a guild run?
---
See, this is what i mean. I can understand giving more priority to other people, but i still want something for my time and effort on the raid, with all due respect to how loots are rolled and where they are needed. I am not a second class citizen.
---
Recipes are a special kind compared to other loot, so i accept it without no issues. But if i were trashed over and over again i would feel both disrespected and doing useless work.

the fireballs worked a bit differently a few weeks back which might be why you experienced that, they targeted the highest person on threat but the aggro drop only affected 1 person which was the person with the lowest "GUID" number. GUID is a string of numbers assigned to you on character creation, the earlier you created your character the lower your GUID number was.
---
in other words, the oldest characters in the raid would always eat the threat wipe if multiple people got hit by the same fireball. this is why you would sometimes see multiple fireballs hit you at once, an older character was near you &amp; absorbed the threat drop from the fireball. when people figured this out you could cheese onyxia by having 2 people stack and the 1 with the lower GUID number absorbing 30 fireballs in a row (and thus the threat drops) and then onyxia would land straight on the maintank again, but they fixed this claiming it was a glitch. 
---
funnily enough Ragnaros has a similar GUID mechanic which still works, wrath of ragnaros (the AoE knockback ability) only knocks a maximum of 3 targets away and it only affects the 3 oldest characters. so in reality there's no point for meele/tanks to run out, it's more efficient to have the 3 oldest characters eat every knockback and have everyone else permanently stay in. the only issue is that the threat wipe from the knockback affects all 40 players so people still need to watch their threat.
---
Cool ... but why?
---
I've never used a macro for it, because I always angle myself 90 degrees away from the target for my ghetto premeds to avoid auto attacks. But if you want to use a macro for it, you'll need to use a weapon swap macro. As I haven't used one myself I don't have a specific one that I've tested to paste, but it should be something like:
---
#showtooltip cheap shot
---
/cast cheap shot
---
/equipslot 16 [insert your weapon name here]
---
I guess one might perhaps want to add a /stopattack after the /equipslot command.

Imagine being proud of hitting level 41 and getting a mount 3 months into release and it hits front page... this sub sometimes I swear...
---
This endless noob circle jerk is going to be the death of me.
---
Except no one who gets lucky and gets everything they need has any incentive to continue showing up to raid.  People mysteriously disappear once they win their big items, and you continually cycle in new players because you have to replace them.  Those new players still need every item and roll on it too, meaning no matter how many people have received the item you want due to a luckier roll you're still rolling against that many people going forward.  It's an endless cycle of luck wins, and as an unlucky person I heavily favor dkp.
---
I was previously in a free roll guild and this exact situation happened, and I moved to a dkp guild and couldn't be happier.
---
People don't care about mounts for their functionality in retail. It's more of a collector minigame at this point. People are interested in collecting as many mounts as possible, or farming for a specific rare mount for bragging rights. So it's about as pointless as pets, which you could say are pointless, but it appeals to another playstyle. It's a very very different experience to classic mounts
---
Outplayed GG ez
---
Ok cool now go get Rivendares Deathcharger
---
In a serious guild, people who put in effort gets the rewards. "Some loser" is the one who helps gets mats for the guild, gets all the enchants, helps guildies out? They deserve all the gear.
---
You're not being penalized, OP. You're just lazy and entitled and your guild leaders notice it.
---
Hey man, if getting gear for players who waste their entire lives playing this game keeps them from killing themselves I’m all for it.
---
Because bananas can be traded in for karma
---
Especially since he was the tank.
---
Then they aren’t raid loggers. Gold doesn’t just magically show up.
---
It still has the epic mount cost.
---
The other posts are just people asking for changes when they should know by now that nothing of the sort will be happening.
---
Because it’s redundant and stupid as fuck. Everyone annoyed at the ppl posting about all the ganking should give their heads a shake. 
---
It’s not pvp, it’s griefing. The outcry for changes is completely justified and if you think it’s not then you’re actively contributing to killing the game. 
---
If the op is tired of ppl posting about their displeasure then they should stay off the internet and think about moving under a rock.
---
Spriest is pretty damn boring, like 5 buttons to press. The gameplay is just too straight forward and the skill required to perform just isn’t there, it’s why I chose lock on classic.
---
Yes, stuff like 40vs40 wars did happen in vanilla, especially in Hillsbrad and Ashenvale. Nobody is underestimating vanilla PvP.  
---
*That is not at all what it is like in Classic.* This the problem. It's unbelievably camped and one-sided on almost all of the PvP servers. That is the issue at hand. Most alliance players have literally no choice but to corpse-hop their way through anything that resembles a choke-point.
---
First 3 are easy to kite but I find the burning steppes guy easier to melee than kite. Silithus is nearly impossible without a lot of consumables, but if you get the right kiting path you can do it with just a mana pot or two. Took me a bit to figure out how to kite around the ruins properly but once you get it it's straightforward. Hardest part is competing with other people for it.
---
No its gone far beyond that. They were interesting and fun to collect up until WoD I’d say. After that they started releasing the same modes with different skins and multiplied that strategy by 100. What we have now is just an attempt to release mounts as a form of lazy content and its gotten so transparent, theyve lost their value as something worth collecting.
---
This is 100% wrong. I've seen blizzard restore them twice. As long as chat logs are there, they'll fix it and ban the offender.
---
Well i mean i trust people more than math to evaluate other people, but yeah if it's such a big taboo for you use whatever system you want. As long as it's not rolling.
---
Then how is classic loot more interesting? It's just variations of "1% crit or hit" and damage/healing to X type of spell.
---

&gt;Both has shown to be very inaccurate.

Got a source? Only part about what I linked that's possibly inaccurate is that some low pop servers didn't get fully scanned.

Me getting into strat live group with a bunch of stuff on res this morning: 
---
Mage: Woah now we get a rogue
---
me:  shadowcraft shoulders on res? (realized it was 2 mages, 2 priests and a druid) 
---
priest: nope we just de'd the 4th pair in a row 
---
me: sick 
---
7 runs and 5 hours later still no shoulders
---
can you use [mod:ctrl] on a /say? That would save you a valuable slot on the spell bar
---
But what if I'm writing this while on the clock?
---
EDIT: And I prolly make more money than you too LOLLLLLL
---
It'd be more like trading gold for the mats, and then the gold back for the craft. So, estimate the worth of the mats and ask for it as a collat.
---
Of course it doesn't work if the crafter is poor, but he can always borrow money. In any case the dude who scammed op told him he didn't have any money problems and had bars lying around so obviously he would've been fine with a collat unless he was scamming.
---
You can stop the census and do your manual /who

Enhance has as much right to it as a warrior.

They would be fucking furious. But doesn't make it so.

In a guild group, yea warrior all the way.
---
I have 460 shadow dmg with pvp trinket/carrot. I go around with max riding speed and shadow word pain and devouring plague.  They have to either dismount or they die. Shits so much fun at night time when there aren't raids.

Oh god, you’re right. Thank you!
---
Have no fear!  Today, on my 51st strat run I saw animated chain necklace for the first time.  I know the feeling, but believe me the cape exists!
---
I am a hunter -16 bag slots, and I still carry that neck with me at all the time lol.
---
Alliance by the way!
---
What do you need 48ap or 1% crit?
---
I don't believe you.
---
I've killed quite a few that tried to run by with a mind blast/flay and a SWP as well lol
---
I get a lot of Watertight trunks fishing in wreckage pools, and they quite often contain wool bolts.
---
The logic I'm following here is that since he is a tank it would officially be rolling for his Off Spec, since it is a DPS piece. Just like it would have been off-spec for the ele shaman or I to roll on it.
---
 If it wasn't such a rare item I wouldn't have even questioned it, but you dont see that drop everyday.
---
We needed another DPS to finish our LBRS run because one of our previous guys was tired and he decided he had enough.
---
Our Hunter said he found someone but we would all have to pay 5 gold each to this DPS.
---
I was group master so i declined immediately and told everyone not to pay anything.
---
He then cussed me out saying i am a bad healer with no friends. And then he left.
---
Yeah, i am not paying anybody to run dungeons even if it was the best Prot warrior on my server.
---
Not quite a shit post my friend
---
I mean usually the outcry is about shit that everyone hates. I think the amount of people crying about wpvp in this sub are a minority, because when I play the game everyone's talking about how this is the most fun they've had in wow in years. On both sides too! Remember, WoW exists outside of reddit
---
He's not hitting rank 14 even when AB is out cuz he won't be able to dodge pte-mades unless the rest of the ally who can dodge and just roll pugs all day let him have it and I don't see that happening.
---
Pretty sure it's entirely dependent on whether or not the scammer still has the scammed items on hand. If they don't - blizzard's not likely to just dupe items in game.
---
And this is why it is the best shit post I've ever read.  It's like meta post-irony shit post.
---
When Cata launched, you could fly everywhere right from the start. And what did players do? They ignored most of the ground content and just flew directly from the questgiver to the quest objectives, and then back to the questgiver again.
---
It's not that they "regret flying", they just don't want to design an interesting world and then have all the players just fly over it and ignore everything that isn't a quest objective.
---
That's why they keep flying locked until like halfway through the expansion.
---
P1 was a disgrace tbh, Layering was prolonged for way too long with its rampant abuse (I would have liked to have honor system after 1-2 weeks as its super fun while lvling) 
---
Dire-maul was also released way too early
---
and they should have started at 1.7 itemization
---
Is that a bad gun for hunters?  If it's an upgrade and he equipped it I would say you were in the wrong.  If I had a forors drop for me on my warrior and some pug rogue needed on it I would be pissed.

You havin a bad day, champ
---
What zones do Black Lotus spawn in

I stack stamina. Have survived through rogue stun locks as a tri spec. Lost to an UD rogue with engineering though (with shadow reflector and that extra stun grenade).
---
Part of me does want to respec pure shadow again, but I also like healing flag carriers and pissing off people in BGs.
---
It opens up a lot of philosophical questions... like, is it still a shit post if it's unbeknownst to the author?  Big questions.
---
I have never seen a GM restore ninja’d items. I was of the understanding that a player can scam but risks being socially alienated by the community.

No, but I need to find something to kill the last hour of my work day.

These comments complaining about the posts complaining about the complaining are worse than the posts complaining about the complaining, which are worse than the posts complaining

Not if there is a magic DPS in the group that needs it.  MS &gt; OS every time.  Wanna get spell dps gear, fill a dps spot.
---
Not quite I just want people to group if possible lmao
---
Upvoting for visibility. We need a response from Blizzard.
---
I run a fury prot build and we typically raid with 35 people. When I DW tank we kill my target first. If I'm the MT on bosses, I use a shield. Deep prot doesn't have that much more mitigation than sticking 20 points in there. I'm also pretty stacked with gear so my healers dont have issues keeping me alive
---
Fade only reduces aggro temporarily, once the effect ... fades, you get all your aggro back. So use it instantly when you pull aggro and you'll be fine, no salv needed, pretty much ever.
---
Because their tier gear looks like bananas
---
We cleared MC in greens. You don't need lionheart helm to be raid ready.
---
Indeed. Blizzard was worried people would be spending to much time in there and not in the world. Queue garrisons lol.
---
Horde vs Alliance
---
I had this happen yesterday running BFD, I’m a priest and I wanted those pants to drop so bad, you know the ones with 15 spirit. Well the mage in our party wanted them too (despite them not reaaaaallly being mage gear) but I found myself hoping they wouldn’t drop just so he wouldn’t get them. Reading your post made me realize what an asshole way to think this is, thanks op for helping me check myself. Remember to enjoy the game and don’t get to caught up in the loot grind! Btw the pants didn’t drop, at least I got my wand though.
---
Most of them are bad. You're supposed to be dispelling, dotting, and if there's a member that's about to die you pop out of shadow form and heal them. Healers should be cc'd and maybe mana burned. For premades though, shadow priest is the worst spec to bring.
---
and there is one of the reasons they don't want classic to be treated like a stand alone game.
---
money whoring? yep
---
so chad they cant even fight back in a video game
---
Thinkyou missed my point.
---
I was showing that's what most people think.
---
In reality we have a lot to offer
---
This MIGHT not be the best place... maybe you should join your server's discord server?  Also, each realm has its own subreddit so....
---
All I'm trying to say is this is like the worst place to accomplish what you're trying to accomplish.
---
The boots dont seem to match either but I guess that's a risk I had to take when I thought I could take your place as the life of the party.
---
Seems like a bit much for an arcanite rod, but sounds like the price is not what you're complaining about. Sounds like you're complaining about this dude not trusting a complete stranger over several hours of his time that he took to farm the gold/mats.
---
Sorry to be the one to break it to you but you're not the center of the universe. Random people in an online game do not know you or how trustworthy you are. They have every right to look for an assurance in case you're not.
---
"If somebody don't trust *me* enough to give *me* mats". The question is, *who the fuck* are you ? You gotta realize that.
---
&gt;with no room for variation other than luck (i.e. crit). That’s simply not true.
---
Because there is no other deviation outside of crit and killtime within the class. If its "simply not true", tell us what else there is to it. There is no ressource pooling, no procs or ability interactions. It's cast all your damage racials/CDs and then cast frostbolt 27 times in a row.
---
Sorry, but its not only mages. Every single class is on about the same level. Especially healers. If you want to check it yourself warcraftlogs is free to use and public information. And this information is crystal clear. Just check ANY of those low killtime logs. All of them are going to be mainly orange logs, some purple. Thats because the difference between a good and a bad player is pretty much non existant.
---
Barely any abilitys interact with eachother and you end up with one abiity outperforming every single other one to a point its not worth using.
---
Alliance on Benediction do the same bs.
---
Not an issue I have, but 15-18 seconds of stealth followed by a 10 minute cooldown....dont think it's going to get them far. If they could spam them everytime before the stealth was up then sure, it would be a viable strat.
---
As I said mate I’m new to this so I have no clue to be completely honest, well thank you for telling me that, I really appreciate it but you could’ve started with that geez haha
---
bless the troops
---
Obligatory plug for Fight Club discord, they have everything you could possibly need to know about warriors.
---
As others have said, fury-prot isn't really necessary for 90% of guilds. Keep in mind that fury tanks only generate more threat than prot tanks if they are dual-wielding while doing it, and logs tell us that dual-wield tanks take ~40% more damage over the course of a fight. That's a pretty big burden to put on your healers. A couple of dps having to back off so not to pull threat is not enough to justify fury tanking in raids. If you find that a considerable number of dps are starting to cap out, your first solution should be to get more threat gear before turning to fury.
---
Also, a lot of people overlook that Impale kind of sucks for raid tanking. First off, deep wounds is basically negligible, you won't have very high crit, or weapon damage, and the debuff will likely be bumped off very quickly. Impale might seem good, but keep in mind it is only a +20% damage BONUS to ABILITIES. From a threat perspective, that means it's +20% of the base (non-crit) threat from DAMAGE on your shield slam, revenge, and heroic strike. I emphasize damage because all of these abilities generate bonus threat that does not benefit from impale. Even if you are somehow crit capped the total TPS increase of impale is less that 1% per talent point, and you have to take improved rend and deep wounds to get to it. Just not worth it.

Druids got flying at 68 in Outland :)
---
Paid heavily under the table but yeah, I get what you're saying
---
I was checking that website earlier and it showed me 28/72 A:H the last 7 days. Now it shows me something totally different. It seems like a scuffed source. Other people seem to share my thoughts.
---
Sorry I'm having too much fun lmfao.
---
Winterspring, Burning Steppes, Eastern Plaguelands only IIRC.
---
make sure you watch the youtube vid about it too, covers off alot of the benifits/drawbacks of each build and playstyles etc.
---
Back in 2004 when first starting out i scammed a dude out of wool cloth by saying i could make bags.
---
He ticketed.  I got the cloth removed and a 3 day ban.  Person got his cloth back.
---
This was within 2 weeks of launch, btw.  in 2004.   
---
This is blizzard using an excuse to cut back on CS workloads so they don't have to employ more people to actually support the games they have.   It really is as simple as that.
---
Yeah that’s a dick move. I’d be pissed as hell being dragged from questing or somewhere else, specifically called out to assist in a group. Then kicked on the way over.
---
lots of time to read that thesaurus in between res timers.
---
Fair enough, each to their own.
---
I was playing City of Heroes way back and a guy left our group because his wife was giving birth.  We were all nice fellas wishing him luck and all.
---
Then we found him at the slightly higher level spot.
---
I felt betrayed.
---
\&gt;guy gets a bunch of people to help him, probably for free, and proceeds to brag about how cool he is while offering no credit or gratitude at all
---
Thoroughly unimpressed.
---
Oh snap!
---
*Classic wow was a failure*
---
This guy sounds like a hardcore negative ninny. 
---
*I'm Having a Great Time*
---
This guy sounds like a casual who is playing the game correctly.
---
Thats what i used back in the day
---
I bought a Blackstone ring as a warrior. I just had to stand in a certain spot near the waterfall and they could transfer the loot with Master loot.
---
Not sure if it would work for Rotgrip or the Goblin though.
---
care to explain?  genuinely curious.
---
Gandling has been good to me and I still find myself frustrated by alliance ganking. Seems pretty even.
---
&lt;Goldshire Inn Staff&gt;
---
Oh god... 
---
These poor people, the amount of shit they must put up with...
---
At least as Tauren. They are barely sentient as it is, it would be a waste. Something like mining seems fitting, the ability to hit a rock is there.
---
Eh, yea that's pretty much how I feel about them now at least. I guess it depends when you started. For example I only became interested in mount collecting at the end of WoD and had some fun with it in Legion and some of BfA, so maybe it's just one of those things that's fun for a couple years but then loses its novelty.
---
I do agree the mounts in BfA look shite tho. All of it is reskins, and the real kick in the balls is the coolest looking mounts are the ones hidden behind a paywall
---
That's true, but in your case the dude told you he didn't have any money problems and had bars lying around. Even if that means he just has say 200 gold, you can always ask him to borrow money from people who trust him. It's a bit much to ask but what else can you do if Blizzard won't do anything.
---
Thanks for the warning though if I'm ever in your situation I will definitely ask a collateral.
---
That's not something Blizzard has ever fixed. The item theft, however, was something they would have addressed in Vanilla.
---
Brb gotta comb my lobster
---
Maelkor was one of the biggest cunts around.  He was kind of like having a douche bag drill sergeant as a raid leader.  Had a lot of friends between GS/Aeternus/EJ back then - good times.
---
This does not work in dire maul.
---
Most people are having great time or so many servers wouldn't be full during work days.
---
Ofc only really really small percentage of people posts on Reddit and most do it to complain about P2 despite everyone knowing it will be like this in advance on PvP servers
---
I meant specifically in between pulls. If I finish with 35 rage, especially if I have Enrage, I’m not popping out to heal lol
---
All aboard the Shoe-Shoe train!
---
arent you the guy that compared getting ganked/ganking to actual abuse?
---
not sure you have much to laugh about my friend :(
---
Add up the pieces that have hit on them, or download something like dejastats
---
Faction specific queues may or may not be an answer to the problem, but it is pointless asking for it because Blizzard will never do it. They have said so many times that they don't want to keep people from playing the game and this would only make more people unable to play, so it will never happen.  
---
Honestly there just isn't anything to do really other than release BG's early (as they've announced already). This is how vanilla works. Of course this isn't exactly like it was in vanilla, but people anecdotal "I played in vanilla and it was like this" or "I played in vanilla and it was nothing like this" doesn't really mean anything because this isn't vanilla, this is classic. After 15 years of retail WoW, the players are different, the meta is different, the server pop is different etc and thats just one of the fundamental problems with #nochanges that were bound to happen. This is the price we have to pay. In vanilla Blizzard would've adapted with a change (because thats how retail WoW works), but with Classic, that is not an option. Therefore nothing is really gonna fix this.
---
Furthermore I feel like faction specific queues would help very little. More horde PvP than Alliance (therefore still more horde PvP'ing with faction specific queues). People will still only notice when the hordes are camping and not when the alliance controls the area and the alliance will still sit in Ironforge all day, because thats what they've accustomed to in the last few weeks with phase 2.  
---
Anything other than changing the games (honor/pvp system) would not really solve the core issue)
---
SGC is bis for tank warrior for threat generation. So wouldn't be a OS.
---
I hate loot whores. I get wanting loot, but a lot of people just turn into douches. I have no problems rolling against someone if it's a legit upgrade for both of us. Rather do the dungeon and have a chance at it then spend another hour looking for the perfect group where I have no competition for my precious blue Strat piece
---
There was a guy in tibia who collected red apples hahaha, he had a tibiawikia page and everything. This ss made me remember.
---
You're fine with paying 13$ per month to have a game that's literally near unplayable ? That doesn't bother you ?
---
someone has to give all the alliance women affection.  alliance too busy waiting on res timers and saltposting on reddit :)))
---
Destromath and most pvp server were alliance dominated from what I remembered.
---
Working on it.  Already have the mats saved up for the AQ mount too.
---
Why even bother removing the items from the scammer if you're not gonna restore them? How do you manage to go halfway on an issue like this, either allow it or don't
---
They're all Horde dominated.  I'm not even exaggerating.  All of them are imbalanced in Horde's favor.
---
I hellfire a lot and always have pots on deck. THE DEEPS!
---
This clearly upsets you so I’m gonna keep it brief, I’ve played both pretty extensively and lock has far more options and far more to do in pvp than shadow priest, shadow priest just isn’t very fun unless you’re not good enough to play a class that actually takes skill so you need a spec that’s impossible to be bad at.
---
This would work just fine for PvE servers, you'd just have the choice to participate or not.
---
But honestly, there's SO MUCH game design potential untapped in WoW, it's amazing. So much things you could do with Contested Zones, a real Honor system, Reputation, etc, the possibilities are endless!
---
it doesnt require 5, but we will use 5 to make it take 1 second instead of 3.  that is two seconds we can use to gank even more alliance!
---
So there’s no reason to go higher? I’ve got muggers belt and the talent points. Been trying for the DMW dagger but it won’t drop. Should I just buy a scarlet kris?
---
Play a different game. This game was not made for folks like you.
---
Yeah, but the only people who actually bitch about raid loggers are the lifers.
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/ check faerlina, it's swapped over :-/
---
&gt; This guy sounds like a casual who is playing the game correctly.
---
Or he's playing Horde on Skeram.
---
I had guildies CoD me Runecloth because our AH is so sparse that I bought all of the Runecloth for sale on the entire server 10+ times.
---
I didn't save much money by asking for their help, mostly time, and they got to sell their increasingly useless Runecloth.
---
Also I thanked them repeatedly, including in this thread, before you made this post.
---
Nah, too many times getting rolled off. Group went to heck
---
Was the tea bagging necessary?
---
Enha yes, Ele/Resto no.
---
You're right, and nowadays people whine because there is too much hand holding.
---
I’ve been told it’s 9%. 3% for Bow Specialisation. 3% from surefooted. Then I need 3% from gear. 
---
Sound right?
---
And people didn't believe me that you were being ripped off... ROFL!   So, what pray tell does your $15 go for?  In the past you got top of the line servers, amazing customer support,  bug and exploit patches, and TONS Of new content.   Now, you get what?!?  Nothing...
---
Solid argument bud, get back to me when you feel like having a real discussion.
---
Ty for the reply
---
So since soc is worth it, should I drop 5/5 imp Seal of righteousness? I am planning to use a 1h and shield mostly, and I see what you are saying about going ret, but one thing i didnt mention is that I would like to be able to tank, heal or deal somewhat decent dps whenever I need to. Which is another reason leveling in holy while focusing on the dmg aspect appealed to me. Basically my mindset is to make a paladin where I widdle my opponents down (but actually killing them in the end) instead of trying to burst them down in 1 glorious soc proc
---
Benediction, not as populated at the big servers but that is a plus in my book.
---
Felt the same after camping Prince Nazjak all my spare time for 2 months. Trinket finally dropped after a couple kills.
---
Background: Back in vanilla people would put this item along with others like Teebu's Longsword and Pendulum of Doom as: 'once in a lifetime drops' or 'essentially unfarmable' because of how obscenely rare they are. Not only is it a collector's item but either currently or in the future (stat changes in burning crusade) they are the best in slot 29 twink caster gloves. As far as I remember, all spellcaster twinks consider these an upgrade with varying levels of disagreement over whether 'of the Shadow/Frozen' wrath are better. Either way I'm glad I got the drop and my exhausted screaming recorded. I've never had anything even remotely close to this rare drop for me in my ten+ years of playing both vanilla &amp; private servers.

Here's the [Wowhead page](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9491/hotshot-pilots-gloves#comments)
---
What’s your main hand dagger? Or are you with no daggers currently?
---
From my understanding the benefit after 308 isn’t nearly as impactful so going for +dagger skills over other stats isn’t optimal.
---
Vulpera
---
Heartseeker is alliance dominated
---
Phase 2 =/= first patch  
---
Phase 3 =/= first patch  
---
It'll come when it comes.
